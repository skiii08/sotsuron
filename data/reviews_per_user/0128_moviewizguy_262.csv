The Blair Witch Project," Unsettling and Tense
","Three film students travel to Maryland to make a student film about a local urban legend... The Blair Witch. The three went into the woods on a two day hike to find the Blair Witch, and never came back. One year later, the students film and video was found in the woods. The footage was compiled and made into a movie. The Blair Witch Project.I finally saw this film since it came out in 1999 because I was waiting to buy the DVD for a cheap price. Well, I bought it after I saw 'Cloverfield,' 'Diary of the Dead,' and 'Rec.' Fortunately, that didn't ruin the film for me.This film accomplishes a feat: It shows very little in the film, yet the film is quite scary! Like I said, very little is shown in the film. There is quite little violence and blood in the film and it's best to say everything in the film is left up to the audience's imagination, which I liked.This film doesn't need creepy make-up effects for monster. It doesn't need violence and gore. It doesn't even need a scary soundtrack. It works the way it is. The performances by the three leads were fantastic and realistic.Apart from it being a scary film and the true definition of a horror film, I thought the humor in the film was funny. You know, the jokes. This movie is like terror unfolding. It doesn't seem scary at first but the film slowly and expertly raises the tension and scares within each scene.Overall, this is what I think horror films should be. It successfully scared me without showing me anything at all, which is pretty amazing, in my opinion. It doesn't need high quality special effects for some scares and it didn't need a big budget. This film is a must see if you like horror movies.",8,1,2,23 July 2008
The Avengers," Some assembly required.
","When an unexpected enemy emerges that threatens global safety and security, Nick Fury, Director of the international peacekeeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D., finds himself in need of a team to pull the world back from the brink of disaster. Spanning the globe, a daring recruitment effort begins. -- (C) MarvelTHE AVENGERS is good, not great. The film does its job in entertaining the audience but not much more. It has some great action scenes, some truly funny moments, and some drama, but overall, it cannot be compared to the top superhero films, which includes THE INCREDIBLES, THE DARK KNIGHT, and SPIDER-MAN 2 for me. It's a popcorn flick, and if that's what you're expecting, then you'll be satisfied. As a Joss Whedon fan, I expected much more from the film than it just being entertaining.I felt the whole dysfunctional family aspect could have been executed better and expanded to be a more significant portion in the film. There was only one scene where the tension between the superheros can be felt, but that's about it. The film also could have used a bit more heart as I felt the whole team working aspect to be lacking in the emotion area. Additionally, the story seems to be overdone by now: Villain wants power and tries to take over the world. Maybe something different would have been more engaging.However, apart from those flaws, THE AVENGERS is a good film. The key success is due to the superheros themselves and how effectively Whedon manages to balance each of the characters without having one overshadow the other. Out of all of them, the Hulk, played by the talented Mark Ruffalo, is my favorite. He seriously has some of the most memorable moments in the film. Robert Downey Jr. is great as well. As of now, Downey pretty much nails his role as the egotistical yet charming Tony Stark. Black Widow, played by Scarlett Johansson, also gets some great moments in here which is good since she's the standout female character in the film. However, I felt they could have done more with Captain America and Thor. Additionally, although he's utilized better in this film than in THOR, I wanted a different villain than Loki.Overall, THE AVENGERS is a fun popcorn flick that starts the summer season but not with a big bang as I hoped for. The film could have used a bit more external conflict between the superheros, as well as more emotion. However, the film doesn't take itself too seriously, and the 2.5 hour running time really flies past you before you know it. Think of it like a better version of TRANSFORMERS 3.",7,1,6,4 May 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Fairly Entertaining
","Treasure hunter Benjamin Franklin Gates looks to discover the truth behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, by uncovering the mystery within the 18 pages missing from assassin John Wilkes Booth's diary, after learning out that his great-grandfather could've been involved in the assassination. Can Ben clear his family's name? Or will his family be linked to the murder of Abraham Lincoln?One thing I was annoyed about this film, along with several other Disney films, is that the MPAA are afraid to rate Disney movies a PG-13 rating. Yes, National Treasure 2 could've been a very fun popcorn movie, and it is, but the film is filled with too many immature jokes to make kids laugh. The Pirates film can't be Disney's only PG-13 films.Apart from that, I found this film pretty entertaining. When I started to watch this, I was dreading it. The actors TRY to be funny that they aren't. I was thinking, 'What are they doing here? Seriously.' I didn't try to enjoy it like the first movie. I was thinking about the wasted talents from the cast but then it grew on me. I started to 'go along with the ride' and enjoyed it after about the 30 minute mark.No, I wouldn't say it was as entertaining as the first and in my opinion, the first film is one of the best fun and energetic adventure films I've ever seen. Along with the first, this film did a great job not boring you for about just 2 hours long. This film will keep you entertained.Everyone in here seem to have a pretty good time making this film, along with having a good time acting on screen, including a newbie, Hellen Mirren. However, I really do not like the clichéd use of having divorced couples in a sequel film after the protagonist falls in love with his/her lover in the first.Anyway, this film is bigger but not necessarily better than the first film. The action and visuals are better, I must say. Although it feels like the first movie all over again (you can't help but sense a deja vu that is happening while watching this film), this film does a well job keeping you entertained from beginning to end.",7,3,5,3 June 2008
Angels & Demons," Extended Cut Review
","After the pope's death, a nefarious organization stashes an antimatter bomb somewhere in the Vatican, threatening to annihilate the conclave of cardinals who are meeting to elect the papal successor. To pass the time until the bomb will detonate, the enemy begins to torture and kill a few of the individual cardinals, but there is a pattern to the grotesque executions, involving hidden sculptural symbols and secret architectural clues. Unfortunately for the church, the man most capable of deciphering the code is the American 'symbologist' Robert Langdon, who happens to be an affirmed atheist.A+D is how every sequel should be: The filmmakers found the flaws in the first film and fixed them, making the sequel better. Almost everything is improved in this sequel: The slow pacing in the first film is tightened so much that the filmmakers had the actors talk while walking/running to different locations. Hans Zimmer's underscore in the previous film is now much more blatant and epic, which can keep anyone with ears awake. Even Tom Hanks' hair is less annoying. However, the storyline is still as outrageous and ludicrous as the first, but that's a given if you've read the books written by Dan Brown.Now judging the film on its own aspects, A+D is a well made time-ticking thriller. After an unnecessarily long forty-minute set up, the ball starts rolling and you're sitting in a roller coaster ride that doesn't let up until the climax. I found the film very exciting and suspenseful and it was nice to see some great monuments and statues around Europe. Having only seen the extended cut of the film, I was surprised by how violent the film is, but I say that as a compliment. I think the film benefits with more blood and violent images that give the film a much more mature viewing than other PG-13 action flicks.Tom Hanks returns as the main role and he's just as good as the first film, although he looks a bit older. His new partner, Ayelet Zurer, is good enough for the role she's playing, although she seems to disappear for a while in the middle of the film. Ewan McGregor gives a good performance with his Irish accent, although it wasn't spectacular. I also liked Hans Zimmer's score, which gives the orchestra something more to do compared to the first film.As a sequel, A+D is better than THE DA VINCI CODE in almost every category ever invented. As a thriller, it's a suspenseful thrill ride from beginning to end. The scenery for the film is wonderful and the third act is amazing. If I had one complaint for the film, it was the oh-so-obvious twist ending which anyone could see a mile away if they paid attention. Still, what else could you ask for in a popcorn flick?",7,0,0,30 May 2010
Black Swan," Dark, Twisted, Brilliant
","BLACK SWAN follows the story of Nina, a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life is completely consumed with dance. When artistic director Thomas Leroy decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily, who impresses Leroy as well. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side with a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.BLACK SWAN is a dark yet viscerally engaging film that is perfect on almost every level. Director Darren Aronofsky crafts each scene with care and precision. The use of mostly handycams is nothing short of a brilliant decision, bringing in a sense of realism and grittiness which is appropriate for this film. Most importantly, Natalie Portman gives the performance of her career. Like Aronofsky's REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, BLACK SWAN starts off small but slowly builds up to great intensity with a chaotic climax that will leave your jaws dropped.The film manages to sustain an unsettling atmosphere throughout along with hypnotizing you whether you like it or not. The score by Clint Mansell is pretty captivating too. Along with Natalie Portman, the rest of the cast are just as fantastic. Mila Kunis is one of my favorite new stars out there after having seen her in FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL and THE BOOK OF ELI and she gives an effortless performance playing a sexy and slightly dangerous character. Winona Ryder also gives a terrific performance although she's in a brief role. Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey are pretty good as well.While not as depressing and intense as REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, BLACK SWAN is a pretty similar film. With a wildly terrific performance by Portman, an interesting visual palette that your eyes can feast upon, and an unrelenting atmosphere that will put you at the edge of your seats, BLACK SWAN is a twisted yet seductive tale about the dark side of human nature which we can all relate to, as unfortunate as that may sound. BLACK SWAN is really one of the best films of the year.",10,5,11,17 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Captain Jack is Back!
","Crossing paths with the enigmatic Angelica, Captain Jack Sparrow is not sure if it's love-or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the 'Queen Anne's Revenge,' the ship of the legendary pirate Blackbeard, Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know whom to fear more: Blackbeard or Angelica, with whom he shares a mysterious past. -- (C) DisneyPOTC4 is not better than POTC and POTC2, which goes without saying. However, I'm happy to say that it is easily better than the overlong and overbloated POTC3. On top of the fact that this is essentially a reboot of the series (you'll be hearing that a lot this year), POTC4 is quite enjoyable than one might expect in what seems to be a tired and prolonged series! Even though Gore Verbinski is out of the director's chair, Rob Marshall keeps the film consistent with the previous films in terms of style and returning characters, including the great Captain Jack Sparrow. However, even though it is the shortest film in the series, it still felt very bloated like the previous films. 30 minutes could have been easily cut out in the film's first hour, which unfortunately dragged quite a bit. However, once the mermaids come in, everything starts to pick up fairly quickly, and the film ends up being a really enjoyable action-adventure, a feeling which was absent in POTC3.And speaking of mermaids, they are one of the best and most unique parts of the film so much so that I wish they were in the story much longer than one 10-minute sequence. Still, the film doesn't suffer once they are gone. In fact, the second half of the film is just as entertaining with a climax that's just plain fun. Johnny Depp returns, playing the role that he's probably most well known for. Even the fourth time around, I still enjoy his antics and clever, funny lines. I don't think it'll ever get old. Geoffrey Rush also returns as Barbossa, although he seemed a little tired and old in here. There are some new members in the cast, most notably Penélope Cruz and Ian McShane. I thought Cruz brought some life in the film, and she made the story a little more interesting. I didn't find McShane to be any special, but he wasn't bad either. There's also Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges- Frisbey, who I thought had a sweet (albeit unnecessary) romance subplot.As with any Pirates film, POTC4 has some great set pieces, although the action seems to happen in a much smaller scale than the previous films, which didn't bother me. The effects for the mermaids are really great as well. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is as loud and bombastic as ever, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just wasn't different or new. Overall, although POTC4 isn't the great return to form everyone was hoping for, it's still a huge improvement over POT3. The addition of Cruz is also a huge plus and seeing her and Depp's interplay is pretty great. If you wanna have a fun time at the theater, you can do a lot worse. Also, wait until the scene after the end credits if you want to see the inevitable open ending to POTC5. 6.5/10",7,5,7,24 May 2011
Men in Black 3," The sequel nobody asked for.
","Agents J and K are back...in time. J has seen some inexplicable things in his 15 years with the Men in Black, but nothing, not even aliens, perplexes him as much as his wry, reticent partner. But when K's life and the fate of the planet are put at stake, Agent J will have to travel back in time to put things right. J discovers that there are secrets to the universe that K never told him -- secrets that will reveal themselves as he teams up with the young Agent K to save his partner, the agency, and the future of humankind. (Columbia Pictures)It seemed that MIB3 was going to be all kinds of horrible. All signs pointed to it: The troubles during production (I believe Will Smith had problems on set, and the script wasn't finished when they began shooting), the horrible mess that was MIB2, the bland trailer, the lack of creativity going into the posters, having a sequel nobody asked for being released 10 years later, etc. Imagine my surprise when I had a huge smile on my stupid face when the credits rolled!The key to the film's success is Will Smith and Josh Brolin effectively playing off one another. Brolin, in particular, gives such a fantastic performance that you think Tommy Lee Jones might have had his voice dubbed over Brolin's. Seriously, Brolin looks and feels like a younger Tommy Lee Jones, and it's not an impersonation. It's a performance. The rapport between Smith and Brolin is more entertaining than any amount of explosions would ever do for the film, and it's a good thing that their relationship IS the film. Unfortunately, Tommy Lee Jones isn't in the film that much, but he was good for how long he was in it. I would also like to praise Michael Stuhlbarg, who plays such a fascinating character called Griffin, and he is able to hold it on his own with Smith and Brolin. I also liked Jemaine Clement as the villain, who is virtually unrecognizable under the heavy amount of make-up effects by the great Rick Baker. I consider him to be my favorite villain in the series.When you take a look at the good sequels throughout the past few years (Spider-Man 2, The Dark Knight, Kung-Fu Panda 2, Toy Story 3, etc.), you see that they don't try to outdo their previous films. Their success lies in their characters and expanding their emotional arcs. At times, too many summer films focus too much on the special effects and action scenes while adding too many characters and too many subplots. MIB3, however, focuses on the characters, while the action and effects stay in the background. Sure, the action and effects are good, but what makes the film good is the way it humanizes Agents J and especially K and the way it gives them an emotional pathos. Of course, nobody would ever expect that from MIB3, which makes its payoff have more of a profound effect than anyone would have ever dreamed of.One would argue that the unexpected critical success of MIB3 has more to do with the very low expectations from people after several years and less to do with its actual quality. I'm here to say it isn't that. MIB3 is a genuinely good film. Is it an amazing film? No. While MIB3 won't go in my top 10 of 2012, it's a damn good sequel nobody ever expected to be any good after MIB2. Despite the troubles during production, MIB3 somehow gets it right. Sure, there are big plot holes in the script dealing with time travel, but it's a rare threequel that actually doesn't suck. Indeed, it's a miracle. In my opinion, it's the best film in the series.",7,1,3,28 May 2012
Alien 3," On Earth, EVERYONE can hear you scream
","Despite the efforts of Ripley and the space marines in the film Aliens, an embryonic alien infiltrates the starship. It accidentally triggers the ship's emergency systems, dropping the escape capsule to the surface of a nearby planet. Ripley finds herself in a prison colony peopled by a religious cult composed of former murderers and rapists. Meanwhile, the alien has managed to grow into a new and deadly form, and is picking off the weaponless prisoners. Ripley soon discovers, much to her horror, that the real danger is much more personal...So, this is 'supposedly' the worst in the series from the people's and critics' opinions. But that still didn't let my expectations low for this film after I've read the plot for the film. I got even more excited to see this film, not only that, but because some other people thought this was the best film in the series.Well, I'm split in the middle. I found it much better than 'Aliens' but not as good as 'Alien'. To be honest, I don't know why there is even a fourth film. I thought the climax of this film was done very well and could've made a trilogy out of this franchise. I guess they wanted to make more money.Like any David Fincher film, the whole look of this film is terrific, so far the best in this series. There is even more humor and violence. So why didn't more people respect this film? Well, I can pick out a few reasons, some which I really much agree with: Killing off Newt, Bishop, and Cpl. Dwayne Hicks might have been a bad idea.I could go on saying they killed wrong people at the wrong time just the sake to make a higher body count. Oh, and that the Alien doesn't appear in most of the film and that the many times it had appeared, it was all CGI instead of using it as puppet. The CGI Alien, honestly looked horrible.And that's probably what annoyed me with this movie the most. Other than that, I'm fine with it. I'm also glad to say the characters are less stupid than the previous films, although they are still stupid. There is, more or less, suspense and thrills in this film, but not as much as the previous two films.What I like about this film is that it's not afraid to be different from the last two films. There is one point in this series where things get repetitive. There are some signs that they are running out of ideas in this film but they have many new ideas too. Sigourney Weaver have matured into her role as Ellen Ripley, giving a much better performance than the last two films.I might be in the minority saying this was a great film with some many annoying flaws but I'm sticking to it. I thought the ending was satisfying without a fourth movie, although there is one, and that the film has a strong performance from Sigourney Weaver. I know it doesn't have the horror and action aspect like the previous two films, but as I said, it's not afraid to be the oddball.",5,2,9,24 August 2007
The Incredible Hulk," Is It Really That Good?
","Depicting the events after the Gamma Bomb. 'The Incredible Hulk' tells the story of Dr Bruce Banner, who seeks a cure to his unique condition, which causes him to turn into a giant green monster under emotional stress. Whilst on the run from military which seeks his capture, Banner comes close to a cure. But all is lost when a new creature emerges; The Abomination.Compared to this year's 'Iron Man,' also released by Marvel, you can tell why that's the better movie than 'The Incredible Hulk.' I can't compare this film to Ang Lee's 'Hulk' because I've forgotten all about it but as a movie for its own, I was expecting much more (probably because 'Iron Man' was so good).The movie starts off really fast, much like 'Fantastic Four.' You don't get a chance to know the characters. It just starts off and minutes later, you find people chasing the main character, Bruce Banner, played by Edward Norton. Well, they then changed their mind within the first few minutes to finally show us some characterization. Apart from that, this film is really mediocre.The pacing is all over the place. The Hulk looks more or less CGI-ish. There's one scene where you can tell they want you to make it look real and it kind of does, because it gives off a rubber-ish effect. The action scenes was a let down. Even the showdown in the end between the Hulk and the Abomination was so disappointing because it felt like a video game. If you like it that way, it's fine by me.However, the movie was fairly entertaining. Some may be disappointed by the dialog-filled scenes in the first 30 minutes of the film because they just want to see the Hulk. Edward Norton does a decent job as the Hulk. Liv Tyler did a well job as his girlfriend and Tim Roth did a decent job as well.See it in theaters? Well, I think you should wait for it on DVD. Yes, there's a Tony Stark cameo but for that, you don't have to see the movie right this moment. Some of the action scenes wee a little entertaining and overall, it's just mediocre, I'm sorry to say. Watch 'Iron Man,' instead, a much better movie.",6,2,5,14 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," One of the Best Movies of the Year
","This film is about Ethan Hunt, with a help of some friends, who has to retrieve the 'Rabbit's Foot' in order to save his newly wed wife.I have not seen the TV show for the films nor have I seen the first two films of the franchise. I must say, I thought I would just get a big budget action flick that I would remember. That's one reason I liked it. This film surprised me! This is one of the best films of the year!Yeah, it promises the action and it has plenty of it. It also has the story and the acting. Tom Cruise and other supporting actors/actresses, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, has great performances.Just like the 007 films, this film is a spy movie with great gadgets and all the things you ever want in an action movie. It's better than the recent Casino Royale, in my opinion. This film offers more action and thrills but the two films are tied with the acting and story.This film had a disappointing box office. It didn't made as much as people thought it would did and this film deserves to be seen, even though people hate Tom Cruise.This film is very enjoyable and runs smoothly. From a fan of J.J. Abrams, I loved this movie. This film has action, great acting, and emotion. This popcorn flick is one of the best films of the year!",10,1,2,30 December 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Wrong Time. Wrong Place. Wrong Number.
","In New York, when the unlucky newcomer Slevin arrives in the apartment of his friend Nick Fisher for a leisure time, he is mistakenly taken as being his friend, who debts money to two powerful bosses of the criminal world. He is pressed by The Boss to kill the gay son of The Rabbi, as a payback for the death of The Boss's son and pay off $33,000 to The Rabbi. Nick's next door neighbor, Lindsay, who works in the morgue, tries to help Slevin. Meanwhile, a mysterious man is secretly plotting to kill Slevin and Slevin is under constant surveillance by the relentless Detective Brikowski.From the first five minutes of the film, about five people die but you're not so sure. Mainly, you're not so sure of anything because this film is trying to be clever, trying to run you into false conclusions. On top of that, the film goes in a fast pace, so you will have to keep up (I didn't, though).This film will keep your attention from top to bottom. If you're one of those people trying to look for a thriller that tries to keep you guessing until the end, you will like this movie. If you're a mainstream audience member, then you should watch another movie.Some might say this film tries too hard to be clever like a 'Pulp Fiction' kind of way and that it succumbs to a convoluted plot. Others might think this movie works the way it tries to be and the way it turned out. I loved this film, by the way. I love how the film plays out and tries to keep you guessing until the end.What I also liked on top of that are the performances by these great actors and actress. Apart from Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis, the performance by Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are really good. I also liked Lucy Liu's character as a fast talking, intelligent person.If you are looking for a film other than a film that spoon feeds you, # Slevin should be on the top of your list of intelligent and ingenious thrillers. If you're not that smart to follow a fast plot, like I, you might still end up liking it or you should just watch another movie.",9,5,7,10 September 2007

Determined to fight for her freedom, she urges four other young girls to band together and try to escape a terrible fate at the hands of their captors before the mysterious High Roller comes for Babydoll. Led by Babydoll, they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice in order to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man, their unbelievable journey, if they succeed, will set them free.. -- (C) Warner BrosSUCKER PUNCH may be Zack Snyder's most mature film to date. It deals with dark subjects such as rape, physical abuse, and greed, for it being PG-13 and all, and it carries a surprisingly heavy emotional weight. Although it may seem like an exploitation flick on the outside, SUCKER PUNCH is actually about female empowerment. Snyder smartly downplays the female body as sex objects (although one might expect the opposite, considering his previous films), never giving fully close up views of any part of them, and I really appreciated that. Snyder wanted to make a film that would make young girls feel good about themselves, and he succeeds with flying colors.The film works mostly because of the female ensemble cast, who all step up to their game (well, MOST of them do). Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone were really quite terrific in their performances. Carla Gugino was pretty fantastic as well, playing an unrecognizable role. However, lead Emily Browning doesn't have much to do but to give mournful expressions in slow motion, which is a shame considering how great of an actress she is. I really wished the screenplay would have fleshed her character out a little bit more, although in the end, the creative reasoning does make sense. Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung are definitely the weakest of the bunch simply because the story doesn't focus on them much, but they get the job done. Oscar Isaac plays a memorable villain, and I'll leave it just like that.As expected from a Snyder film, SUCKER PUNCH is a visual feast. Snyder has created a unique world, being quite the visionary he is. Seeing the film in IMAX was certainly an eye full. It's almost as if each shot in the entire film was carefully planned, which is a commendable effort. From the production design to the cinematography to the visual effects, they're all pretty much nailed down. The action sequences are mind-blowingly inventive as well. Gosh, does he make slow motion look good. And let's not forget about the totally awesome soundtrack: The renditions of classic songs are amazing. Also as expected (and hinted earlier), the script doesn't quite pack as much punch as the visuals, but it's not as bad as one might expect it to be. It's just that the plot gets repetitious at a point, although Snyder does try to change it up. Also, the pacing could have been fixed a little better, which WATCHMEN also suffered from.I also must point out how unpredictable the film is. I honestly did not expect a lot of things coming at all. Although far from a perfect film, SUCKER PUNCH is pretty great seeing how far Snyder has come. The visuals are great, although the script isn't as good. The performances by the cast are terrific, and it's just an immensely enjoyable film overall with a great message for young girls out there.",8,10,20,25 March 2011
The Longest Yard," Yeah, It's Entertaining. Get Use to It
","Paul 'Wrecking' Crewe was a revered football superstar back in his day, but that time has since faded. But when a messy drunk driving incident lands him in jail, Paul finds he was specifically requested by Warden Hazen, a duplicitous prison official well aware of Paul's athletic skills. Paul has been assigned the task of assembling a team of convicts, to square off in a big football game against the sadistic guards. With the help of fellow convict Caretaker, and an old legend named Nate Scarborough to coach, Crewe is ready for what promises to be a very interesting game.Yes, it's what you expect in a Adam Sandler movie. Yes, it has the visual gags and crude humor. Yes, it's filled with (humorous) one liners. Get use to it. This movie was pretty entertaining from beginning to end. I like how the camera shoots the football scenes because it looks really cool and entertaining.I also liked the modern score, making you feel young again. I might be in the minority who liked this film. I also found it surprisingly emotional and it's not all immature, childish jokes that are in the film.Adam Sandler gives a good performance (yes, getting drunk) and gives the group a 'team spirit'. Chris Rock's performance was okay and Burt Reynolds performance was good. Other supporting characters are humorous or villainous.In the end, you know it, it has a showdown better two teams who are trying to win the football game. Yes, it has been done with several sports movie but I really don't care. In the end, it makes you (or me) smile and you (or me) would be really satisfied.It's more or less what you expect in an Adam Sandler movie. If you want to watch it, go ahead. If not, don't watch it. Football fans would surly like it for the last fifty minutes of the film, though.",7,1,4,5 July 2007
50 First Dates," Daja Vu All Over Again!
","The title of this comment is not that I hate this film. The title of this comment is basically the premise of this film. Henry Roth is a man who leaves woman after he dates, kisses, or have sex with them because that's not what he's looking for. He wants to meet a woman that'll be perfect for him. He finally meets Lucy in a restaurant. They get along together great. Henry finally thinks he found the perfect woman but there's one problem: She has a short-term memory that forgets him each day she meets him. This film is hilarious with Rob Schneider. The on-screen couple, Sandler and Barrymore, is great. This film is funny and heart warming but sometimes makes you feel sad. The ending could disappoint a few people but it was satisfying for me. One sad thing is that it reveals the ending for The Sixth Sense. So if you're going to watch this film before watching The Sixth Sense, you might be mad (like me) because it reveals the ending for it. If you think this is another old Adam Sandler movie, you're wrong. This is an entertaining piece of material!",7,0,0,18 June 2006
Ghost," A Really Entertaining Film!
","Sam and Molly are a very happy couple and deeply in love. Walking back to their new apartment after a night out at the theater, they encounter a thief in a dark alley, and Sam is murdered. He finds himself trapped as a ghost and realizes that his death was no accident. He must warn Molly about the danger that she is in. But as a ghost he can not be seen or heard by the living, and so he tries to communicate with Molly through Oda Mae Brown, a psychic who didn't even realize that her powers were real.This film probably has every genre in it. It has romance, comedy, horror, thriller, mystery, action, suspense, and fantasy! It was really freaky because first you're laughing your head off but then it all turns into a horror film. There were even some 'edge-of-your-seats' scenes! The cinematography of the film is also fantastic!This film is highly entertaining! There are some memorable romantic scenes between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore and hilarious scenes mostly done by Whoopi Goldberg, which is one of the most memorable character in the film winning her an Oscar. The three and Tony Goldwyn were great in the film.As I said, this is a highly entertaining film. It will probably fit well for everyone because of it's various genres. This is one of the best films!",8,5,6,24 March 2007
The Ring," Still Scary After All These Years
","It's been 13 years since The Ring was released, and yet, somehow, the film holds up incredibly well. Maybe not in terms of technology, but in terms of scares, it's one of the best out there. I remember watching the film as a teen and immediately regretting my poor decision. Having recently rewatched it, the film still managed to get under my skin, and for good reason: The atmosphere is palpable, and a sense of dread is consistently sustained from the first scene through the end credits. And let's talk about that first scene featuring a young Amber Tamblyn who, nowadays, is instantly recognizable. What a scene to grab an audience's attention! Haunting and unpredictable, it's no surprise The Ring's opening is considered to be one of horror's best, easily as good as the ones from Scream and Jaws.Despite its scares, The Ring is also a surprisingly beautiful looking film, and with a $48 million price tag, it should be. Unlike most horror films these days, cinematographer Bojan Bazelli provides some amazing compositions and frames every scene with unexpected allure, even though the film is filled with plenty of disturbing imagery. Of course, director Gore Verbinski should also be given credit for the film's success. Rarely have I seen a horror film in which all of its moving parts worked together so well. From the production design, performances, the aforementioned cinematography, editing, and soundtrack from Hans Zimmer, it's like witnessing a master who actually understands the language of film.As for the screenplay, writer Ehren Kruger of... (wait for it) the Transformers films, gives time for the story to breathe and build, an uncommon characteristic for a horror flick. Kruger also cleverly writes in an familial subplot that provides an emotional underpinning for its characters. What people tend to forget about The Ring is that even though it's about a journalist trying to solve the mystery behind a cursed tape, it's also about a broken up family that slowly comes together in the wake of a crisis. Because of that, I will say that the ending is unnecessarily cruel and unearned, providing a twist that pulls the rug from under the audience just for the sake of doing so.Still, lead Naomi Watts is able to carry the film on her shoulders through and through. In spite of not being a notable actress at the time, her impressive performance as the strong-willed Rachel quickly put Watts in the mainstream spotlight. Martin Henderson and David Dorfman also provide memorable performances as the remaining members of the family, though it's disappointing to see Henderson has yet to reach A-list status as Watts did. He provides the charisma, charm, and humor required for the role. Cameos from veteran actors Brian Cox and Jane Alexander also raise the film to another level, and both are terrific in their limited screen time. Overall, The Ring is an unnerving yet gorgeous film, supported by an assured direction from Gore Verbinski and a breakthrough performance from Naomi Watts. Who says PG-13 horror can't be scary and well made?",7,2,2,10 August 2015
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Love Adventure Films? You'll Love This!
","The year is 1936. A professor who studies archeology named Inidana Jones is venturing in the jungles in South America searching for a golden statue. Unfortunately, he sets off a deadly trap doing so, miraculously, he escapes. Then, Jones hears from a museum curator named Marcus Brody about a biblical artifact called The Ark of the Covenant, which can hold the key to humanly existence. Jones has to venture to vast places such as Nepal and Egypt to find this artifact. However, he will have to fight his enemy Renee Belloq and a band of Nazis in order to reach it.I finally got the chance to see this film when I bought the box set of the first 3 Indiana Jones movies and I would like to compare it to two other action franchises released in this time: The Mummy and National Treasure. Now anybody who knows me knows that I loved National Treasure and The Mummy. Both films are really enjoyable and thrilling at times!Well, Indiana Jones feels that way. The action is there and the comedy is there. It's all done perfectly. Well, this film is certainly not flawless but it's a lot of fun and the characters in here are memorable. Harrison Ford and Karen Allen are great together as the duo.The one liners aren't even painful to hear! The set pieces are fantastic. However, I must say the action sequences are really dopey and sometimes dumb but they are tolerable. Overall, it's a really entertaining action adventure film where characters deliver one liners and make up wise cracking jokes.",9,0,0,10 June 2008
United 93," An Excellent Piece of Work!
","On September 11, 2001, four planes were hijacked. One of the planes was the United 93, or Flight 93 in which we see what happened before is crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.This is a great film. It's one of the best films in 2006. One thought I had before seeing this film is that this will be an airplane movie like Red Eye, Flightplan, or Snakes on a Plane. I was wrong. Instead, it shows the point of view on different characters, some who are not on the plane and the rest that are on the flight.This film also shows human spirit and how we work together. There wasn't any main characters but for no-named actors, they were good. This film is thrilling and suspenseful, while some may never see the film because it's 'too soon'.It's not soon. It's a perfect time to see the film and all of you who thinks this film should never be created. It ever reaches the political side. Everyone knows the story and know how it ends but it's still thrilling.The last 30 to 15 minutes are the best. It'll leave you speechless. This film is very intense, heartbreaking, but inspiring. United 93 is an amazing film like World Trade Center, another 9/11 film made in 2006. Both films are worth watching so see United 93.",9,2,4,27 January 2007
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. Phone Home
","While visiting the Earth at Night, a group of alien botanists is discovered and disturbed by an approaching human task force. Because of the more than hasty take-off, one of the visitors is left behind. Now some children find him and must take him home.This is such an amazing movie and will remain a classic over the years. There are some terrific cinematography and score in the film filled with some memorable scenes and great acting by some characters, like Henry Thomas and Dee Wallace but Drew Barrymore gives the comedic performance to make the film light-hearted.This is another of Steven Spielberg's greatest films ever and it's a fantastic family film! He is such a great filmmaker. The effects in the film (for being in the year 1982) is great.If you like good movies that should be worth watching before you die, see this one because it's cheerful, touching, and teaches us a great moral.",9,0,0,6 April 2007
Casablanca," Here's to you, Kid.
","In World War II Casablanca, Rick Blaine, exiled American and former freedom fighter, runs the most popular nightspot in town. The cynical lone wolf Blaine comes into the possession of two valuable letters of transit. When Nazi Major Strasser arrives in Casablanca, the sycophantic police Captain Renault does what he can to please him, including detaining Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo. Much to Rick's surprise, Lazslo arrives with Ilsa, Rick's one time love. Rick is very bitter towards Ilsa, who ran out on him in Paris, but when he learns she had good reason to, they plan to run off together again using the letters of transit. Well, that was their original plan.... During the first few scenes in Rick's nightclub, issues of World War II are shown through the mixed customers of Vichy French and Nazi officials, refugees, and thieves. On top of that, tensions between the Vichy French and French patriots are shown in one pivotal scene, where a group of Nazi officers, led by Strasser, sing a German patriotic song, while Laszlo and the rest of the crowd sing the French national anthem, eventually drowning out the Germans.Casablanca is a classic, with Citizen Kane and The Godfather. Everyone knows that. But if you know me, I usually find classics like these overrated, because I set high expectations for these films before watching the movies that, in the end, I am left disappointed. Casablanca is no different. No, the movie isn't bad by any means. In fact, I think the movie will grow on me after I watch it several times. However, right now, I don't seem to be getting the hype.I liked the performance by Humphrey Bogart, as the unemotional, bitter man. He plays it quite well. Ingrid Bergman plays decently alongside him, both having a good chemistry with each other. The others, including Paul Henreid and Claude Rains, are decent in here too. The score is pretty memorable but what I love most about this film is that each character seems to be well in the end because throughout the film, they all seem to be miserable people that have gone separate ways. These are good people and it's good for us, the audience, to know they aren't angry in the end because they each deserve their happiness.The film is also shot in black and white, even though the use of color was an option for the filmmakers. Sometimes, certain films are better to be told in black and white, while others are better told in color. No doubt, Casablanca works well being in black and white, although there is a colored version out there. The scenes are heightened with the use of shadows and key things being pointed out are the advantages of this filter.Overall, although I may find Casablanca to be overrated, I enjoyed it. I liked the love story and I was really satisfied in the end. If you have yet to see this film, see it. Although it may not be as good as its reputation holds, it's still a pretty great romance/film noir for any movie lovers to enjoy.",6,1,5,14 May 2009
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," An Entertaining Movie
","Toon star Roger is worried that his wife Jessica is playing pattycake with someone else, so the studio hires detective Eddie Valiant to snoop on her. But the stakes are quickly raised when Marvin Acme is found dead and Roger is the prime suspect. Groundbreaking interaction between the live and animated characters, and lots of references to classic animation.I really didn't want to watch this film. I'm not really a fan of those old cartoon characters and all of that. I was right. The beginning starts off slow but it definitely picks up, which surprised me! This film is entertaining and very good with its cartoon and human interactions!Another thing I like about this film is the multiple cartoon characters showing up in the film like Mickey, Daffy, Betty, etc... although I have to say there really isn't anything special about this film. It certainly isn't one of the best films ever made but it's entertaining.There are some funny moments in the film and I can guarantee that children would love this film so if you like that, you'll want to watch this until the end.",7,0,0,22 April 2007
Minority Report," A Terrific Film! One of the Best!
","In the future, criminals are caught before the crimes they commit, which are told by the pre-cogs. One of the officers, John Anderton, in the special unit is accused of one such crime and sets out to prove his innocence.This is a film you would want to see in theaters. No, it's not a dumb action movie. No, it doesn't have mindless action scenes. And no, it's not a bad film. In fact, this is one of the best films ever!This film is not complicated because it doesn't give too much information than you already need. It doesn't give too much action to make this look like an effect heavy film. And it doesn't bore with overly-long scenes. It has the right touch of action and it will keep you entertained with it's intriguing plot.Visually, the film is fantastic. Some great and memorable scenes are some like the 'spyder' scene and another when one of the pre-cogs warns John which goes through clever action because she can tell the future. Those scenes are so choreographed that it is already a price worthy admission to this film.The acting by Tom Cruise is great. He plays so much more than a one dimensioned character. This film is disturbing and there were some uncomfortable scenes which made my heart pump.This is a movie actually worth watching. It's one of the best films ever to be made with the great action scenes and great plot and is one of Steven Spielberg's best films.",10,1,3,13 March 2007
Finding Neverland," Believe
","In 1903, in England, the play writer James Matthew Barrie has a complete lack of inspiration, and his last work was a deceptive play. When he meets the children of the widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, he becomes friend of the family and Sylvia becomes his muse and her children the source of inspiration. James writes the successful play about 'Peter Pan and Neverland'.I liked the movie for it's imagination and originality. Yeah, the costume design is good and all that mojo bojo but I really don't know what else to say about this film. Johnny Depp's performance was good. Kate Winslet and Freddie Highmore's performances was also good.The CGI in the film was great, along with its cinematography. I found it really moving and emotional with Marc Forster's direction to help it. This magical film is another line of movies that has great performances and script.",8,2,2,6 July 2007
Meet the Parents," A Good Comedy by Jay Roach
","This film is about Greg, or Gaylord, Focker who decides to spend a week to meet his Pam's (girlfriend) father because Pam thinks it would be nice for Greg to see if her father accepts him before they get engage. He soon finds out that her father is very strict and that he is very protective of his daughter and wants what is the best for her.This film is sweet and funny. Some of the jokes could be laugh out loud and some could be overrated. Greg does many things to hide all of the bad things he's done like make Jinxy, the family's cat, to run away and lit the alter, for Pam's sister's wedding, on fire. Many films have targeted this plot but it's so amazing how I like films with the same basic plot.",2,0,1,23 April 2006
Se7en," A Very Good Thriller!
","This very good film is about Detective David Mills, a new detective, and and his partner, Detective Lt. William Somerset, who is about to retire, working on a case of a serial killer using the seven deadly sins for his motive.The first person to die is a person with the sin, gluttony. The aftermath of the 'kill' is very disturbing. That's basically the word that would describe all the other kills in this film. This film is a very good thriller. In fact, it's one of the best films ever.Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman gives great performances, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, played by the killer, although he shows up almost through the last half of the film.Just like Saw, the killer wants to punish those who are bad. For once, we have a killer we agree to, or at least I do. Like many thrillers, this film has this great ending. This is a smart thriller. There's not a lot of action. It's just your usual detective story.If you like a very smart thriller that will make you think, without making you look stupid, with great performances, this movie will do.",7,1,2,18 December 2006
Unbreakable," Are You Ready For The Truth?
","A security guard named David Dunn is coming home from work, when the train he is on is suddenly derailed, the train crashes, and he is the sole survivor, out of 132 people. Without a scratch on his body. Soon he is contacted by comic-book store owner Elijah Price whose bones are easily breakable, who claims David is a superhero.Unlike Shayamalan previous movie, 'Unbreakable' is not a thriller/suspense type film. In fact, it's a different film. It's a superhero movie. Don't worry. This is not the twist, if you think of it that way. It's revealed within seconds during the passage shown on the screen about comic books. This is when you know you're watching a different movie.Unlike many superhero films, 'Unbreakable' does it in a realistic way so it can fit in this world, much along like the TV show 'Heroes,' although the powers and visual effects aren't exaggerated. The film is really subtle. It tends to stay away from what lots of superhero movies have, like big action sequences, for the most part, costumes, and other things. However, it's still a lot like a superhero movie, like this is possibly the start of a trilogy. This is an origin film.Although I loved the movie a lot for its originality, I was disappointed in the end because it was uneventful, probably for budget issues or to ground the movie to a realistic level. Still, I can't help but say it was uneventful. Apart from that, I enjoyed the film immensely. The directing is one of M. Night's best. It's very top notch with a lot of technical movements. The performances by both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are equally great, actually. I was quite surprised.This is not 'The Sixth Sense.' This is no thriller/suspense type film. It's a superhero movie. It's a very different superhero movie. Warning you before hand, I hope you can enjoy this as much as I did. I loved the originality, although it's in the vein of a comic book story, with an origin story to start out a possible franchise. The performances, script, directing, and score are all top notch.",8,1,1,28 December 2008
Star Trek," The future begins.
","The film explores the back stories of James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), before they unite aboard the USS Enterprise to combat Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future who threatens to destroy the United Federation of Planets.Let me start off by saying that I'm not a Trekkie (is that how you spell it?) in any way nor have I seen a single second of the Star Trek universe in my entire life. In fact, I never really wanted to watch the films in the first place because they never interested me. However, since the fantastic J.J. Abrams was on board, I knew I should see this film. To my relief, the film was great. In fact, it's the best movie I've seen this year thus far!If you find yourself almost teary in the first few minutes of this film, you know it'll be good. The film is character driven. There's a lot of action sequences, yes, but the film is really character driven. In fact, the high point of the film was its characters and the casting made it possible. From a glance, Chris Pine doesn't seem like the 'right' person to be in the movie. After all, he doesn't have a good track record for the movies he has starred in so far. However, he really does a great job playing the charismatic, smart talk guy. Zachary Quinto does an equally exceptional job as Spock, a name I've heard so many times without knowing who he really was. Eric Bana plays an almost unrecognizable performance as the 'villain.' Simon Pegg and Karl Urban play the comedic relief characters. And to wrap the diverse ensemble up, Zoe Saldana, Ben Cross, John Cho, and Winona Ryder give us each a unique performance.Apart from the cast, the action sequences were amazing, along with the special effects. The score by the underrated Michael Giacchino is great, especially hearing the theme song for the first time. However, the story is also really great. I didn't realize this was a time movie at first. I found it mentally stimulating. The laid back feel and the slapstick humor adds to the immense satisfaction when the credits roll.The film is really good because there's almost nothing bad to say about it. Yes, maybe you can find one small detail here and there that doesn't make the film perfect, but no movies are perfect. This movie is human, with sharp dialogue, and fantastic characters, a complex story, with action sequences to fill on top. If you haven't seen a summer movie yet, make this your first one. As you can see, the film is very accessible for non-Trekkies. However, I'm sure the die-hard Trekkies will appreciate the new, fresh zest Abrams have brought into the film.",9,5,17,10 May 2009
Fight Club," Mischief. Mayhem. Soap.
","A ticking-time-bomb insomniac and a slippery soap salesman channel primal male aggression into a shocking new form of therapy. Their concept catches on, with underground 'fight clubs' forming in every town, until an eccentric gets in the way and ignites an out-of-control spiral toward oblivion.For once, I wouldn't know what rating to give a movie. I could give it anywhere between 5/10 to 10/10. I'm very surprised to see that this movie is a special effects-filled movie and that it was a 1999 movie. I thought it was made way before that.The first act is wonderful and it's one of the best first acts I've ever seen. What goes down is its second act, where it turns very violent and forms an aggression on you (or at least, to me). It makes me scared if this film makes others want to fight.The third act begins to turn into a mystery and goes up to be a good movie again. With all the fighting, you are blinded from the truth: Is there a plot really going around? I mean, the whole first hour and some so minutes are pretty much a waste of time (which is why the movie is way too long than it needs to be). It makes me reluctant to give it a perfect rating.I wouldn't be surprised I got the twist ending while watching it because it has been done so many times before (well, at least three movies had already done it) but I still love the creativity put in it. There are so many funny and grueling scenes to see here! I love the acting by Edward Norton, who did a fantastic job. Brad Pitt wasn't as fantastic but was good. Helena Bonham Carter looks almost unrecognizable from her role so it was fantastic.Well, judging from the weak points to the strong point, I'll give this movie a 7/10. This film is really well made and I thought it might be one of the best films ever but nothing was really happening until the third act.",7,1,4,9 June 2007
Underworld," Unrated Extended Cut Review
","A war has been raging between the Vampires and Lycan for centuries, Selene is a death dealer, assigned to hunt down and eradicate the last of the Lycan. When she comes across Michael Corvin who holds the key to end the war she must decide where her allegiances will lie.I was really looking forward to this film and it fell below my expectations. Usually, these 'war between two creatures' films are really entertaining, like Van Helsing or AVP, but this one, it's just flat out boring.I really did not care what happened throughout the movie. I didn't care who died or who were the bad guys. It's a great concept but the story didn't interest me and it was partly confusing, although the CGI, cinematography, and production design were good.The action scenes, which were meant to entertain, were boring, more like gun fights from The Matrix rather than any creature fights from monster movies (I understand they have to save their budget). Kate Beckinsale was sexy in her tights but very dull in her acting as well as many could call this a 'dull' film.This is a very stylish horror film that just falls flat with its boring action scenes and slow pacing. The story isn't interesting enough to follow and the characters dull. Want an entertaining monster film? Watch Van Helsing or AVP.",5,0,1,6 June 2007
Coraline," Be careful what you wish for.
","A young girl walks through a secret door in her new home and discovers an alternate version of her life. On the surface, this parallel reality is eerily similar to her real life - only much better. But when her adventure turns dangerous, and her counterfeit parents try to keep her forever, Coraline must count on her resourcefulness, determination, and bravery to get back home - and save her family.It took me about a month to watch this but I finally did and I would like to say, it was worth the wait. To start things off, I would like to say this is a disturbing movie, more for the adults than to the kids, actually because of the subject matter. Is this a movie too scary for kids? It depends. If your child loves to be scared, probably like you were when you saw 'Jaws' and 'The Poltergeist' when you were a kid, this is the perfect movie for them.The movie isn't scary, per se. It just has a lot to do with the mind. The movie is disturbing because the story itself is disturbing and if you can't tell by now, that's a rare thing. The movie is also, technically, very beautiful, including the 3D to heighten up the senses. The designs, the sets, the look, etc. is all very beautiful and sometimes very elaborate.As for the movie itself, I was moved by parts of it, disturbed by parts of it, thrilled by parts of it, and humored by parts of it. The voice cast is good, although nothing special to mention about. However, there are some parts where the movie moves slowly. After all, the movie runs about 100 minutes, longer than most animated films. The film isn't perfect, yes, but it's one of the best movies I've seen this year and the best 3D movie I've ever seen! It's quite incredible. Well done, Henry Selick!",7,1,3,22 February 2009
Shakespeare in Love," Not a Shakespeare Fan but I Loved This!
","Young playwright William Shakespeare struggles with his latest work 'Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter'. A great fan of Shakespeare's plays is young, wealthy Viola who is about to be married to the cold-hearted Lord Wessex, but constantly dreams of becoming an actress. Women were not allowed to act on stage at that time (female roles were played by men, too), but dressed up as a boy, Viola successfully auditions for the part of Romeo. Soon she and William are caught in a forbidden romance that provides rich inspiration for his play.This film is very fictional. Perhaps you might already know that (I just wanted to point that out). You know I hated the play 'Romeo and Juliet' but I thought I'd give this movie a chance, since, it's not a play. Instead, I was wrong. This movie is largely based on Romeo and Juliet, which I've already seen two different versions of it already.Well, I didn't mind seeing a new version of that play. In fact, I actually liked it for the first time because William's events that happened in his life actually inspired his plays! In my opinion, that's just awesome! The costume designs in this film is great, as you can expect from any Shakespeare adaption, and the production design is also great.If you've read or seen the play Romeo and Juliet, you might have a very fun time in this movie like I did because you know what happens before anyone else does! I liked the acting by Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow, which both have great chemistry (not to mention this is Paltrow's first film in which I saw her breasts, not to be perverish or anything).I wasn't a Shakespeare fan, but now, I truly like his work after seeing this fictional film. This film is fantastic from beginning to end, earning it an Oscar for Best Picture! Don't care about any historical accuracies and you'll love this as much as me!",7,1,2,23 May 2007
Iron Man 2," Tony Stark is Back!
","The world is aware that billionaire inventor Tony Stark is the armored super hero, Iron Man. Under pressure from the government, the press and the public to share his technology with the military, Tony is unwilling to divulge the secrets behind the Iron Man armor because he fears the information will slip into the wrong hands. With Pepper Potts and James 'Rhodey' Rhodes at his side, Tony forges new alliances and confronts powerful new forces.It's been about two years since the last IRON MAN film and now, the sequel officially starts off the summer on a disappointing note. Like many sequels, IM2 fails to live up to the original, yet it isn't an entirely bad film. It's just very disheartening to see so many flaws in a film in which the original film was so great.The main flaw of the film is, you guessed it, the story structure. When the film gets to the second act, the film gets into the convoluted territory. There were like five plot lines going all at once, most of which were even unnecessary. It was just a mess and I didn't believe some of the characters' actions. The characters Pepper Potts and Lt. Rhodes seem to be against Tony Stark just for the sake of giving him more problems to resolve.Another problem is the underused actors since there are so many characters, including Mickey Rourke. Rourke could have been a pretty cool interesting villain if he would have more screen time, but he ended up being a generic villain. Sam Rockwell is another new cast member who I didn't seem to care about. Robert Downey Jr. is great in his suitable role as always along with Gwyneth Paltrow. I thought Scarlett Johansson was pretty sexy with her bad ass fighting moves, and Don Cheadle doesn't disappoint.The film also suffers from the role of what SHIELD has over this film. There's just too many references and characters that appear here just to remind the audience that Tony Stark will be in an Avengers movie. However, saying that, the film does have some pretty fantastic action sequences, although there aren't many. One cool scene was in the climax, which was explosive and kinetic.Overall, there isn't much to say about this sequel. The first act and climax are good, but the second act is just a convoluted mess. However, as a summer popcorn flick, it's entertaining while it lasts but is immediately forgettable after the credits roll. But let's be honest. Every one is going to watch this movie regardless of what other people have to say. It's just THE movie to see this summer so I'll just say stay after the credits to see one extra scene. Enjoy it for what it is and nothing more.",6,2,4,8 May 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Witness the resurrection.
","Ellen Ripley sacrificed her life to destroy the Company's desires to use the alien as a weapon. 200 years and seven horrible experiments later, she is resurrected on the USM Auriga using blood samples from Fiorina 161, for the purpose of extracting the alien queen inside her. After a band of smugglers, hired by the government, bring the crew of a hijacked transport to the Auriga, all hell breaks loose when the aliens bred from the hijacked crew escape. When the Auriga is set to automatically pilot back to Earth, its up to Ripley and the smugglers to stop the Auriga and escape with their lives.After the great conclusion of 'Alien 3', I really thought there shouldn't be another sequel, but there is. It's called 'Alien: Resurrection', a truly unnecessary sequel probably to just make money from the fans. Many people called 'Alien 3' the worst of the bunch. I'm with the people who called 'Alien: Resurrection' the worst of the bunch.When saying 'worst', I don't mean it's a horrible or stupid film. I actually liked the first hour and ten minutes. This film is by far the best looking film from the series. Obviously, modern technology has grown. The special effects are much better and the Alien make-up looks much scarier.And although some franchises get a little repetitive and boring, this film manages to use some new ideas. On the down side, the new ideas are a bit awkward and uncomfortable to get use to. This movie is unlike the previous three films. Instead of a movie driven by characters and its plot, it's driven by visuals and action, which is called a popcorn movie.I'm all for a popcorn Alien movie, like 'Alien vs. Predator', which I truly enjoyed. Yeah, this film has cheesy one liners and constant chase sequences. What I didn't like about this film as a popcorn film is that the film falls apart by the last 45 minutes into the film. It all gets ridiculous and stupid.There's also a time in this franchise where you are all Aliened out. I felt that way when watching this film. Sigourney Weaver's performance is decent but she acts like a jerk, for some unknown reason. Another good performance was from Winona Ryder.If you're up for another Alien movie, go ahead and watch this one. It certainly gives you something new and awkward at the same time. The action and chase sequences are well done but I didn't like the story as much as the last three films. I will conclude that this is the worst film in the series, although not a very bad one.",5,0,0,25 August 2007

A twisted punishment for a past uprising and an ongoing government intimidation tactic, The Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which 'Tributes' must fight with one another until one survivor remains. Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy. If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. -- (C) LionsgateAs someone who has read the novel, I must say now that THG is not a perfect adaptation. After all, when do you ever see a novel be perfectly translated to the big screen? Saying that, THG is an incredibly solid and strong effort that should please the fans of the series as well as those who are curious to see what the hype surrounding the film is. If I were to compare this to the Harry Potter and Twilight series, which, of course, is inevitable, you'll be happy when I say that it's a lot closer to the quality of Harry Potter than that of Twilight. I'd also like to end the issue of THG 'ripping off' Battle Royale. Let's be honest here: Those who say THG is a ripoff of BR either haven't read THG or seen BR. While the two both revolve around the same concept, the executions are vastly different. THG and BR both deal with different issues and themes, and therefore, the comparison ends there. Additionally, there is no reason why you should like one and not the other.Getting all that out of the way, here are some issues I had with the film: Even with a long running time of 142 minutes, THG condenses a lot of events that play out in the novel and glosses over some details that I would have liked for the filmmakers to focus more on. The condensing of the material cuts a bit of characterization and makes emotional scenes feel rushed, and the glossing over of some details may make it difficult for someone who has not read the novel to understand what's going on. Furthermore, some of the CGI were a bit cartoonish, especially with the use of fire. Let's hope that the next film will get a bigger budget to improve on some of these effects.However, there are some great additions that came with the film too. Since the novel is written in Katniss' first-person perspective, we only get to know about what she sees and thinks. The film takes advantage of its format and adds some third-person scenes that ingeniously expand the world already created by author Suzanne Collins. As a result, some secondary characters that didn't have much presence in the novel have a lot more screen time in the film, including President Snow, Seneca Crane, and Haymitch. In particular, we get to see the behind-the-scenes of the Hunger Games in a control room where the tech people literally get to play Mother Nature. There are also some small plot changes that help set up the sequels.Director Gary Ross makes the great decision to downplay many things, with the use of hand-held cameras and the resistance to glorify many cinematic techniques. For example, the score by James Newton Howard is only used when is necessary, and when it is used, it's used effectively. This makes the world of Panem feel real and the issues more pressing. Of course, the shaky cameras also allow a lot of violence to pass with a PG-13 rating, resulting in possibly the most violent PG-13 film I've ever seen in my life so far. I also have to give a shout out to the sound department as well, which is another aspect that is taken advantage of to convey the violence. With the start of the film, we are put into an unusual world that we learn ourselves as the film progresses instead of the characters telling us every important plot point because they naturally know the rules of their world already. On top of that, the bleak and somber tone is done extremely well, with the build up to the game terrifying.Of course, this is Jennifer Lawrence's film, and the camera is mostly with her the entire way through. Accordingly, it's a good thing that Lawrence does a terrific job in her role, playing the strong-willed character with such incredible subtlety that it aches us when she finally does show her emotions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta does a great job as well, successfully giving the character the charismatic quality that was in the novel. Adult stars Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland are just great, doing justice to their roles. Sutherland, in particular, plays a menacing villain without showing much emotion at all, delivering his lines in such a subtle yet fierce manner.If you think about what the filmmakers had to work with, a book told in first-person of a new world, and saw what resulted on screen, the accomplishment is commendable, if not entirely amazing. With the direction of Gary Ross and a powerhouse performance from Jennifer Lawrence, THG is a faithful adaptation of the novel that deserves the success it receives. Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be EVER in the series' favor!",8,5,15,24 March 2012
12 Monkeys," The Future is History
","This film is about a volunteer, James Cole, has been chosen to go back in 1996 to gather information about the origin of the epidemic that wiped out 5 billion people, which he was told was spread by the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. He mistakingly went back too far to 1990, rather than 1996. He meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert. Now he goes back to the future again and then go back to the right time. He must stop the spread or it'll be too late.First of all, this film is way over rated. Yes, this film has a clever ending but that doesn't make a film good, does it? This is like any other average film that I gave 7/10 to. There's nothing special about this film.Now to the acting. Bruce Willis', Madeline Stowe's, and Brad Pitt's performance was all great. I even thought this was Brad Pitt's best performance, since it's so weird, could earn him an Oscar nomination.This film is not like most sci-fi films. There's not CGI nor many action, since it's such a low budget. Don't expect guns and bombs in this movie. This film is very imaginative, as always by Terry Gilliam. It's very different.This film is not a master piece but just an enjoyable work. There's nothing special about this film. It's smart and compelling. If you want to see a different film that is clever, go see it. It's not full of action, like other sci-fi films. Just watch this film as entertainment.",7,0,1,7 August 2006
The Impossible," Nothing is more powerful than the human spirit.
","Just a few weeks ago, I complained about how emotionally manipulative 'Les Misérables' (2012) was. Yes, every film is manipulative in a way to elicit a certain reaction from the audience, whether it is to be scared during a horror film or laughter during a comedy. If a film is constructed badly, you see the tricks the filmmakers use on and off camera, making everything feel fake and contrived, which is the case with something like 'Les Misérables.' However, if done well, you get something magnificent like 'The Impossible.'Yeah, I cried. I felt empathy for the characters because they felt like genuine people. I felt like I was there with them through their tremendous struggle. As it is the case with sappy films like this, I'm sure some people won't buy into the film's melodrama. But I did. The film is incredibly well made and directed and the actors simply wonderful that everything felt true and genuine, not fake and manipulative. And that's the difference. 'The Impossible' proves that Juan Antonio Bayona is a director to look out for. Additionally, hats off to Tom Holland. He's terrific in the film.",9,5,10,5 January 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A Great Popcorn Movie!
","This movie is about Jack Sparrow owing an unpaid debt to Davy Jones and his army of sea-phantoms. What? His soul. Now he must save himself from them with a help of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, as they look for Jack for his compass.This movie isn't better than the first pirates film, although it's funner and bigger. It's actually very different than the first film. One problem about the film is that it's just too long. Although it's long, I still enjoyed it by many funny and action scenes. Johnny Depp is the perfect role for Jack Sparrow. The acting is great. The visual effects are great, at first rate.Now another problem of the film is that the film drags along. Some of the action scenes are too long. Although many didn't like the ending, because there is no ending, I liked it. We know they'll continue on for the third film so just get use to cliffhangers. There are good and funny jokes in the movie, many of them involving Johnny Depp. Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) make up is amazing.Kracken, the infamous cool-looking sea monster, also drags the film. The scenes with it just takes too long. This is a huge step from the first film. It's darker than the first film.This is just a great popcorn flick filled with humor, romance, and great action scenes. Although it's not better than the first film, definitely go and see it. You'll have some fun.",7,0,1,10 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Great Swashbuckling Action Adventure!
","This swash-buckling tale follows the quest of Captain Jack Sparrow, a savvy pirate, and Will Turner, a resourceful blacksmith, as they search for Elizabeth Swann. Elizabeth, the daughter of the governor and the love of Will's life, has been kidnapped by the feared Captain Barbossa. Little do they know, Barbossa along with his large crew, are under an ancient curse, doomed for eternity to neither live, nor die. That is, unless a blood sacrifice is made.This is a very entertaining action adventure and probably is one of the best films ever made! I'm not exaggerating. It has an interesting storyline for people to watch, great characters for people to love, great action scenes for people to get them to the edge-of-their-seats, and some clever dialog for people to laugh at!I even have to disagree that the film is too long. Well, I didn't mind it at all because I didn't find a single moment in the movie ever being boring. The special effects of the film was good, as well as its costume design, and production design.As you can tell, Johnny Depp plays another, but this time, a really weird character. His acting is funny and the other two roles by Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and Keira Knightley were all good. The score is also memorable, still being played today.If you want a great, big summer movie (well, that was 4 years ago) then go on and watch the film for you folks who still have yet to watch it! It's funny, thrilling, romantic, and so on!",8,1,4,7 May 2007
12 Angry Men," Life Is In Their Hands -- Death Is On Their Minds!
","The defense and the prosecution have rested and the jury is filing into the jury room to decide if a young Spanish-American is guilty or innocent of murdering his father. What begins as an open and shut case of murder soon becomes a mini-drama of each of the jurors' prejudices and preconceptions about the trial, the accused, and each other. Based on the play, all of the action takes place on the stage of the jury room.With a simple plot and a simple movie, simply put, this is one of the best movies ever made. From the sound of the plot, many of you might be unpersuaded, but the movie is that interesting. It's not boring as you think! It's like the action film filled with special effects for the previous generation! (I know, I shouldn't assume audiences these days love action films with special effects, but you get the point)What's so brilliant about this film is that it's timeless and with one setting, you are pulled in the movie. The movie is also a study of human nature. It's not just 'OK, we need 12 votes to release the convict or execute him.' The dialog is also tremendous. I've never heard a set of dialog this good since, maybe, 'Pulp Fiction.'The film is taut and, at times, suspenseful. The performances were excellent. The film is very interesting and brilliant from start to finish without a second of boredom. This is the classic you would want to watch before you die!",10,0,0,7 September 2008
Hostel," Welcome To Your Worst Nightmare
","Paxton, Josh and Oli are backpacking across Europe when they are told about a hostel in Slovakia. Once they hear that this hostel is infested with beautiful European woman who only want tourists, they quickly get on a train to the wonderful promise land. As soon as they get there, they start having the time of their lives. Soon after they arrive, they slowly start to realize that this hostel is hiding a terrible and dark secret.One day, I just decided to see 'Hostel.' I've seen 'Turistas' first and many people have said it was a complete rip-off out of this film. Well, I can see the similarities but the whole feel for the two films is different, and I actually like 'Turistas' because it was realistic, more or less and the characters were smart.Compared with 'Hostel,' the characters are dumb, at least for the first hour. Honestly, I found the first hour a let down, not because there's not a lot of blood - I don't like that - but because it was basically a bunch of nudity and characters going around doing sex and drugs. I do, however, found Derek Richardson performance really comedic, in a good way.After that hour is over, it really gets good - no, not because there's a lot of torture scenes - but because the film slowly turns to a black comedy, and I mean it in a good way. After a mediocre first hour, I was quite entertained by the last half hour. I was really cheery for the characters and laughing at the screen! If only the first hour was like that...still, that last half hour boosted my like-ness for this film.The performances were decent. I, in my opinion, think that it was worth the wait for the last half hour. Sure, the first hour is just plain mediocre and un-entertaining, but what comes next is the fun part. Give this a rent if you're still unsure.",6,0,0,15 April 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Some journeys take us far from home. Some adventures lead us to our destiny.
","Based on the classic novel by CS Lewis, four London children are sent to a professor's country home in order for protection during World War II. There they find a magic wardrobe which leads to a mystical land called Narnia, which is being ruled by an evil witch. To defeat the witch, they must join forces with Aslan, the lion God of Narnia.I was slightly disappointed in what I saw of this film. It's good, yes, but it's not really all that fantastic, compared to the first films of 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Harry Potter.' I think Lewis deserves better. However, it's good enough to start off a franchise (hopefully). In this first film of probably many, we're introduced to four children, all uniquely different in a good way. It feels like you would want to spend a whole movie with, which is the first thing one must do before making the movie.The CGI effects were brilliant, along with the set designs, costumes, and action sequences. But no, this is not a rip-off of 'Lord of the Rings' in any way, although it does in the trailer. Instead, the two films are completely different, both just seeming to have epic battle sequences, one which seems to have animals fighting. The magic is decent, I guess, although I hope they can expand a little more in the future.I found the film quite good because of the allegory behind it. The film obviously touches on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, which is probably why this film was so successful during the winter season. Apart from that, I found the film quite long. The first act drags a bit and I thought they could've sped up the pace a lot better.The performance by Anna Popplewell, the youngest of the bunch, is quite...annoying. She seems like a rip-off of the character Hermione in the 'Harry Potter' series. Apart from that, everyone else was fine. The best character in here is Tilda Swinton because her character is vicuous. I mean really vicious. I think she ranks up as one of the best villains in movies.I think the film is a decent start to the franchise. I hope the films would get better along the way, much like the 'Harry Potter' films, as well as more magic that made people fall in love with 'The Wizard of Oz.' The look of the film is beautiful yes. It's a stunning achievement. Overall, it's a good film for the family, although it's a bit violent for a PG rating.",7,1,2,28 December 2008

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Defy the Future
","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an epic action-adventure set in the mystical lands of Persia and based on the video game of the same name. A rogue prince reluctantly joins forces with a mysterious princess and together, they race against dark forces to safeguard an ancient dagger capable of releasing the Sands of Time—a gift from the gods that can reverse time and allow its possessor to rule the world. (Walt Disney Pictures)PoP is one of the very few video games that I have actually played and enjoyed a lot, I must admit. As a video game adaptation of the same name, the film is probably the best video game adaptation ever made, although that's not saying much since most of them suck. Still, the film rises above the curse, providing the audience the fun and swashbuckling adventure that we all yearned for since the last PotC film or maybe it's just me.Having played the game, I see that the filmmakers changed up the storyline from the game dramatically, although they stayed put with the dagger being able to turn back time. I wasn't much bothered by it, although it would have been cool to see those gnarly monsters that I loved stabbing in the game. The replaced storyline is much more grand and epic, how a film on this scale should be. For those who played the game, you'll be happy to notice the easter eggs lying throughout the film, from the awesome fighting moves to the turning backs of time. But those of you who haven't played the game shouldn't be alienated. You'll get as much entertainment from the film as anyone else because it's a stand alone film that is completely accessible.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the main character really well with a realistic English accent. I wasn't much bothered that he is, in fact, not Persian, although some might be. He delivered some comedic lines perfectly. Gemma Arterton plays his on screen love interest and although she also isn't Persian, she has some great chemistry with Gyllenhaal. I also enjoyed Ben Kingsley as Gyllenhaal's uncle who may or may not be the villain and Alfred Molina has a fun time playing a quirky role.The action scenes in here range from mediocre to impressive, especially in the climax, although both categories succeed in entertaining the audience. There are some things in here that you have never seen in any other film, mostly due to the source material being original and different. The production design is really fantastic along with the mix of old-fashioned tricks and CGI. Harry Gregson-Williams score also adds on to the epic feel of the film.Overall, PoP is a solid popcorn flick that succeeds in entertaining the audience from beginning to end. If you enjoy old-fashioned movies with an epic story and a great cast like I do, you should give it a watch. For fans of the video game, you'd be surprise to find out that it's actually good! Let's hope the film does well enough for a sequel because I'm up for it.",7,2,5,31 May 2010
Spider-Man 2," The Best Superhero Film Ever!
","Two years have passed for Peter Parker, established in his role as college student...and as a crime fighter. He can't keep up at school, pay his rent or make amends with his estranged best friend Harry, who wants Spider-Man dead. Mary Jane is more skeptical than ever of the man in her life. Peter's idol, a renowned scientist named Otto Octavius, resurfaces following a failed fusion experiment. Peter, at times noticing he's losing some of his powers, and is feeling the effects of the stress in his personal life, realizes he must decide between being who he once was or retaining his secret identity to stop 'Doc Ock' and save New York City.From a disappointment from the first film of this series, I was quite relieved that this film is not only a lot better, it's the best superhero film ever made! There are much more love for the characters in here and the character development. There is also an emotional core throughout the entire film and it's not your regular superhero film.There's a lot of drama in this film, not only from Peter choosing a life to take, but he also has to beat the bad guy, and tries to tell Mary Jane that he loves her. I mean, it's not all about the action in here. The action sequences are much bigger and better in this film with nice CGI to top some of the most exhilarating action sequences.Tobey Maguire's acting is better, as well as Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. The villain, played by Alfred Molina, also does a very good job playing a creepy antagonist. There's one scene with him in it that was filled with tension, like a horror movie. Again, the score is also fantastic.This is the best superhero film ever made! It gives you the fantastic characters, great action sequences, it's emotional, suspenseful, and exhilarating as an entertaining film! This is THE MOVIE, if you're a comic book fan so see it, whether or not you're a fan of Spider-Man!",10,3,3,10 June 2007
The Fifth Element," Finally, A Terrific Film!
","Two hundred and fifty years in the future, life as we know it is threatened by the arrival of Evil. Only the fifth element can stop the Evil from extinguishing life, as it tries to do every five thousand years. She is helped by ex-soldier, current-cab-driver, Korben Dallas, who is, in turn, helped by Prince/Arsenio clone, Ruby Rhod. Unfortunately, Evil is being assisted by Mr. Zorg, who seeks to profit from the chaos that Evil will bring, and his alien mercenaries.There is one flaw in this film. It's kinda long with its slow start. Apart from that, after thirty minutes, it a smooth ride from there. This is what you would want in a popcorn movie. You have the great action sequences with the great special effects and you also have the lovable characters!Visually, the movie is amazing! The set designs are fantastic and the costumes and effects are great! I just loved this movie because not only it was entertaining at best, it was also very funny with it's clever comedic scenes.The acting by Bruce Willis was mediocre. I never thought of him as a great actor anyway. Gary Oldman's, Ian Holm's, and Chris Tucker's performance were funny and probably the best was Milla Jovovich. She learned an entire different language (made up by the director, Luc Besson) and spoke it so clearly in the movie!If you just want a very entertaining popcorn film with very funny scenes and great action sequences with breath taking effects, this is the perfect movie! It's just refreshing to see a movie that don't take itself too seriously to make it that good!",7,1,3,16 March 2007
127 Hours," Every Second Counts
","127 HOURS is the true story of mountain climber Aron Ralston's remarkable adventure to save himself after a fallen boulder crashes on his arm and traps him in an isolate canyon in Utah. (Fox Searchlight)127 HOURS may seem like a mix of SAW and BURIED, the latter which was recently released to theaters, but, honestly, I have to say that it's more gut wrenching than SAW and more emotionally draining than BURIED, although I'm not trying to say both of those films are bad. It just puts you right into a harrowing situation and never lets you go until the end, but you'll be glad you stayed through. As much as it is a hard film to sit through, the film is mainly about hope and the will to survive, which I like because I'm not a pessimistic person.James Franco gives the performance of his career and carries the film really well on his shoulders, which is a good thing considering we're with him for the rest of the film. Although Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn, two lovely actresses, have short roles in the film, it's always nice to see them. The editing plays a huge role in the film as well. It has a similar eccentric visual style like director Danny Boyle's previous film, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.Overall, Danny Boyle does it once again, proving everybody that he's one of the few fantastic directors out there working in the film industry, along with Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino. Franco gives a terrific performance and the film is both gripping and emotional until the very end.",8,5,12,16 November 2010
Batman Returns," The Bat, the Cat, the Penguin
","Batman is pitted against the demented, ravenous Penguin, a pitiful, orphaned psychopathic freak who once went on a baby-killing spree, and a 'power' hungry capitalist villain Max Shreck. As the two criminals plot to gain domination over Gotham City, Batman must plot to stop them.As the film starts, you can tell the tone will be immensely darker than that of the first. Although darker doesn't necessarily mean better, in this case, it's true....only for a moment. I was never impressed by the first film. It struck me as entirely uninteresting and boring, for the most part. In this film, I was, more or less, interested at whats going on. The first hour was pretty good because there are some great things going on, especially with the new characters introduced.However, it started to go down again. After the hour mark, I found myself disinterested because everything starts getting repetitive all over again. Maybe the only Batman films I'll ever enjoy are Christopher Nolan's reboot and its sequel. This time, the film has mostly everything bigger, with more villains and more action. The action scenes still seem second-rate to me. However, like before, the production design is great. I like the look of Gotham and the costume designs for the three character, Batman, Penguin, and Catwoman, largely thanks to the great Stan Winston.Michael Keaton started to grow on me in this sequel. I found him being more comfortable in his role as the title character. Danny DeVito is almost flawless as the Penguin. You'll probably never see him like that ever again. Michelle Pfeiffer is just great as the sexy Catwoman. And Christopher Walken, well, he was just decent among those actors.Although much darker and interesting at first, the film slowly loses its steam halfway, sputtering to a convoluted mess near the end. I kid you not, there were so many things and threats going on in the end that it was ridiculous! Bigger is certainly not better in this film. Tim Burton, I know you can do better than this.",5,0,0,3 January 2010
Finding Nemo," Just Keep Swimming...
","Just keep swimming...--This is a line from the movie that is funny. This film is simple. A fish gets kidnap by humans and his father goes on a look out for him with a help of Dory.Dory has a short term memory that runs through her family. Or maybe its not. Well, she's played by the funny Ellen DeGeneres. She's the one who makes everyone laugh during the whole film. This film is funny for both kids and adults. It's really entertaining with peril here and there. This film is also sad, including the beginning that is hard to see, even for me.The animation, overall, is great. Obviously, Pixar's animation is always great and it'll never become bad. It's wonderful to see the ocean. Everywhere is colorful on the screen. This is a masterpiece. It'll soon become a classic. This film is not overrated. It's fine where it is right now. This is the best animated film of 2004, in my opinion. The moral of the story is good for all of the parents to hear: Do not become over protective to your kids. Sooner or later you'll have to let them go with their own life. Ellen is the perfect character for Dorry. She's just adorable that it makes you put a smile in your face.This is an entertaining and funny piece of work. It's great for all ages and everyone should see it. Go SEA it and have a hopping good time!",10,1,3,18 March 2006
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," X-Men Origins: Wolverine
","The film focuses on the violent past of mutant Wolverine and his time with Team X, before Wolverine's skeleton was bonded with the indestructible metal adamantium. The plot also details his early encounters with Colonel William Stryker, the Weapon X program, Wolverine's interactions with other mutants and his complex relationship with his half-brother Victor Creed.Hearing the reactions from the majority of the people that have seen this film, I'm not surprised that the movie was disappointing. This film suffers from what X-Men 3 did and more: It has too many characters in one short running time, although the film felt like it never seemed to end. Including that, the story wasn't that good and the film felt like it should have never been made. What's the point? Why would anyone want to know the origins of Wolverine? Well, if you do, why would anyone want to sit through such a disappointing origins story?It's apparent the filmmakers didn't spend a lot of time with the whole story. I've never read the comics so I wouldn't know if the film translated what was on page to screen or not. Even in the first few scenes, I was laughing through my mind because of Wolverine's horrible-looking bone claws. The origins story also didn't add much to Wolverine's past. And for the first time, I'll say that the CGI in here was a bit cheesy and very unreal. When Wolverine actually plays with his steel claws for the first time, the CGI looks horrible and cartoonish.With the many characters here, I felt like Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and Will i Am were the best ones here. I feel sorry for Jackman, because you can tell he's trying to do his best with the source he has been given, along with the rest of the cast. I found Lynn Collins very annoying, though, as Wolverine's girlfriend. Ryan Reynolds was decent, although he appears for only a short time in the film and Taylor Kitsch was good too as Gambit.With the negatives aside, I liked one thing: Split the film into three parts and I liked the last, third part. I really found the film enjoyable from that to the end, including an interesting way how they connected the last scenes to the first X-Men film. I also found the action sequences above par, especially the last sequence. Overall, I'm not surprised that I was going to be disappointed. I do like the third part of the film, though so I'll give the film that. If you're a fan, you can see it, although it may not be the best origins story to tell.",5,2,6,16 May 2009

Andie Anderson covers the 'How To' beat for 'Composure' magazine and is assigned to write an article on 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 days.' They are sure to meet each other in a bar and both tries to get what they want without knowing what they are really doing.This is one of the funnier romantic comedies, if you'd like some laughs. There are many laugh-out-loud moments here and there. The humor was witty and slapstick, which I love in comedies.The chemistry between Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey is great. this film is like the battle of the sexes.Don't watch this film if you want lies between romance but if you would like to have a really good time, then this is the film.",7,39,52,12 February 2007

Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldy events, the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost.This film has a high budget, although it's an R rated movie filled with great special effects. But this film is also confusing. New characters come in and you don't know who they are.The acting by Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz were decent. The cinematography is great and the overall look of the film is great.Although it has some dull and confusing scenes, this film is worth a rent but it's not all that good. It's decent at its best.",6,1,4,28 January 2007
The Others," A Lovely Genuine Horror Movie
","I'm afraid that telling a slightest hint of the plot will already give away what's coming when you watch the film, so I'll just give you the set up: A woman named Grace retires with her two children to a mansion on Jersey, towards the end of the Second World War, where she's waiting for her husband to come back from battle. The children have a disease which means they cannot be touched by direct sunlight without being hurt in some way. She then hires 3 servants to help around the house, or mansion.Okay, that really doesn't give the plot, but as soon as you watch it, you'll know it's a ghost story, but this time, it's not mainstream! Well, isn't that original? I'm so glad they don't have those usual horror movie clichés and those huge amounts of gore. In fact, this movie doesn't even need special effects to make us scared because this movie is really creepy.If this can't be one of the best movies in 2001, it should at least be the best or one of the best movies ever made in 2001, if not one of the best horror movies. If you're tied of those PG-13 horror movies, this won't disappoint. It's like The Ring (in as good PG-13 rated horror films).I love this movie because it's like Lost, in which subtle clues are given away little by little until it reaches the twist ending. Believe me, the pay off is great, if you think this movie's pacing is too slow. I'm sure it's slow, if someone figured the twist ending already. If not, don't try to think some up or you'll get mad at the graceful pace the film is moving.Nicole Kidman gives a really great performance in here, as well as many other characters. The cinematography, the score, and the production, they're all great! This film really doesn't follow many mainstream movie rules. This movie doesn't need blood, special effects, scary make-up, etc. to even scare you. This film is creepy and is one of the best horror films these days have to offer. Sadly, there are only few of them.",10,2,4,1 June 2007
Orphan," There's something wrong with Esther.
","The tragic loss of their unborn child has devastated Kate and John, taking a toll on both their marriage and Kate's fragile psyche as she is plagued by nightmares and haunted by demons from her past. Struggling to regain some semblance of normalcy in their lives, the couple decides to adopt another child. At the local orphanage, both John and Kate find themselves strangely drawn to a young girl named Esther. Almost as soon as they welcome Esther into their home, however, an alarming series of events begins to unfold, leading Kate to believe that there's something wrong with Esther—this seemingly angelic little girl is not what she appears to be.I just literally came back from a screening of ORPHAN and forgive me, I'm still soaking in what was in the film. Wow. This was a messed up movie. Really, some of the things in here are just flat out wrong and the fact that the filmmakers had the gumption to do what they did, from the twist to the taboos, I applaud them. ORPHAN has what usually most horror movies have, from the music cue waiting to have people jump out of their seats to the character who is clueless from what's going on. I believe the movie is self aware of itself and other horror films and uses that to its advantage to have fun with the clichés. However, what sets this apart from other films is that it pushed the boundaries. After the movie ends, you can't help but have an uncomfortable feeling lingering as you drive home.But I won't say anymore about what boundaries the film pushed, because that ruins the fun. The film has a running time of barely over two hours, which is longer than most films these days, let alone horror films. Fortunately, this isn't a bad thing because the first half of the film was like a great character study. There is more character development in the first ten minutes of this film compared to all of most other horror movies. I was taken off guard. I appreciated that, making most of the characters people who you would root for.Surprisingly, there is a lot of dark humor. I laughed out loud more than I thought I would and I'm sure the audience I was with was surprised too. When the film started, the audience was quiet, because they weren't sure how the film will play out. By the end, everyone seemed to have the time of their lives. I know I did. With its shares of dark humor, the film also produces some tense and unsettling scenes. This is mostly due to Jaume Collet-Serra, who directed the remake of HOUSE OF WAX, one of my favorite slashers. He sets everything up nicely, while using sound to make the audience uncomfortable. Be on the look out for him in the future. He has a big career in front of him. I know it.The film has its strong performances...and I mean from everyone. Even the kids have strong performances, which is saying a lot. I didn't feel annoyed by them. A film like this must be carried well by the evil kid herself, and she absolutely rises to the task. Isabelle Fuhrman does such a fantastic job playing the evil Esther. After saying that, it still feels like an understatement. Remember Damien? You know, the Devil's child? Well, he seems like a nice kid now. The film is also supported by two great leads, played by Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard. Farmiga plays well as the sympathetic mother that nobody but herself believes while Sarsgaard feels like a clueless father and a great one at that.The film also has a great score composed by John Ottman, along with some nice production values, which give the film a slick look. Overall, if you want to see an evil kid causing havoc, here's the movie. The film mixes the dark humor and tense scenes really well. There's also a twist in the movie towards the end which sets itself apart from other evil kid movies. The twist is not improbable at all, which is a great thing. The film is pure entertainment from beginning to end and it works because of the fantastic Isabelle Fuhrman. I can't praise her enough. Finally, all I have to say is this: Esther is just an evil little kid. Pity, because she's such a great well-mannered artist who can play Tchaikovsky flawlessly.",8,3,7,26 July 2009
Terminator Salvation," The End Begins
","Set in post-apocalyptic 2018, John Connor is the man fated to lead the human resistance against Skynet and its army of Terminators. But the future Connor was raised to believe in is altered in part by the appearance of Marcus Wright, a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynet's operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind.Let me start off to say that each Terminator film is different from one another. The first was a sci-fi. horror, I guess you may call it. The second and third, both very similar to each other, were sci-fi. action movies, opening to the summer audiences. Now, this, this is different. I don't know how to explain it. It's more depressing and gritty than the previous three films, having less jokes and comedic relief than ever, which is kind of encouraging and unfortunate, I suppose. The tone is very different, which is quite great, because I love to see different things from sequels by different directors, this, here, being McG.In fact, from the opening sequence, you can tell the movie will be in a different vain. You can start with the score by Danny Elfman. In this film, I don't remember hearing the main theme for the Terminator films. As a person who never really thought the Terminator theme was that great in the first place, I'm grateful to say that I just fell in love with Elfman's new theme, bringing in freshness to the franchise, as well as hinting the original theme. I might be in the minority, but I don't care. The score was fantastic.What I also like about this is how everything fits together. This is the film where we meet a much younger Kyle Reese, John Conner's father, before he was sent back in time where we finally meet him in the first Terminator film. With that being said, this film didn't really add anything to the story. In other words, we could have gone without this film. However, I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. I look at it that this film is just a set up to what will happen in the next sequel.Now comes the kicker: McG. As a director, I appreciated his previous works, including the pilot episode of the TV show, 'Chuck,' along with the entertaining Charlie's Angels films. I love his energetic feel whenever he directs something. Without a doubt, this guy has a good eye. Technically, the film is stunning. He said before that he wanted to take long shots, and boy, did those scenes stick out in the film. There is one early on the movie that has John Conner coming out of a base, getting into a helicopter, having it hit by a Terminator machine, having the helicopter fall down, having Conner crawl out of the helicopter, and having Conner look up at a huge mushroom cloud hundreds of feet away. Now that's just one. I think these shots are an amazing technical feat.Christian Bale comes into the franchise as the new John Conner. Although he doesn't have that much of a screen time, he did well, honestly. Sam Worthington was suggested by James Cameron for McG to be in the film. In fact, Cameron praised Worthington so much that Worthington became an overnight star. In this film, though, I thought he was decent. He is not really as good as people make him out to be. Anton Yelchin had appeared in 'Star Trek' a couple of weeks ago. In here, he does no less of a fantastic job, playing the young Kyle Reese. He's a great, young actor.Bryce Dallas Howard replaced Claire Danes as John Conner's wife, Kate. I really thought she pulled off well in here, with the limited screen time she appears in here, as well. Moon Bloodgood is the last actor worth mentioning in this film. She does a great job as Worthington's love interest. One last actor I would like to name here is Jadagrace Berry, who plays a mute kid. She put in some heart and soul into this film. I appreciated that. With these actors named, I felt that this was a great ensemble picture.I think the look and feel of the film is incredible. Well, with a budget of $200 million, it better be. The post-apocalyptic look was vast and gloomy. The CGI was flawless, I think. There were some unbelievable action sequences as well. I won't name them here to ruin the surprise but some of them are jaw dropping. As a big summer blockbuster, I think this film is great. I mean, if you're going in to see this film, you better see it as a big summer blockbuster that offers the most explosions I've ever seen on one film, some great action sequences, and some great imagination in work. It's a fun, entertaining movie and the running time shouldn't be longer than it really is now. I can't compare it to the other Terminator films but, if I must, this is as good as Terminator 3 (yes, I liked that movie) and better than the first.",8,5,9,24 May 2009
500 Days of Summer," Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't.
","Tom is a greeting-card writer who dreams of becoming an architect and finding his true love. Summer is a vintage-looking beauty whose ideas about love are entirely modern. As Tom remembers his 500 days with Summer, his mind jumps from moment to moment, largely thinking of the good times in their trouble-filled relationship.'This is a boy meets girl story, but it is not a love story.' As the opening lines of the film suggests, this is not your average romantic comedy and while that doesn't always mean it's a good thing, in this case, it is. Because of this, 500 DAYS OF SUMMER is one of the best movies of 2009. Not only is this a unique romantic comedy, but the way it tells its story is so ingenious and creative, that it makes this film one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. I loved it that much.Sometimes, if a film has this really awesome and original idea, it ends up failing because of the way it's handled. However, it seems as if director Marc Webb used his music video side of him to his advantage to create something magical and enchanting. Every song used in this film is so perfect for the scenes they are used in that it puts Quentin Tarantino himself to shame. Webb also uses another technique used in many Tarantino films: The nonlinear narrative. And it works!Another thing that works in this film is the two amazing leads: Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. Gordon-Levitt is an actor I praised before in BRICK. He also starred in another fantastic film, THE LOOKOUT. Now, about two years later, he's better than ever, playing the charismatic leading man! Zooey Deschanel plays Gordon's love interest and she's as great as usual. I love her in anything she's in. Another person I would like to mention is Chloe Moretz. I personally found her to be my favorite character because she's flat out hilarious.If you know me, you'd know I love movies about love. I especially love the tragic ones as well as the clichéd ones. Even though 500 DAYS OF SUMMER isn't either one of those, I was bound to love it. The film is both very funny and sweet. It's supports a great cast, a quirky and brilliant script, a unique style, and a director who has a bright future ahead of him. For those who love romantic comedies and those who have given up on them, 500 DAYS OF SUMMER is a film everyone should see once in their lifetime.",9,1,2,28 February 2010
The Day After Tomorrow," Exhilarating From Beginning to End!
","This film is about a group of friends competing in a contest in New York. One of the friends father discovers an ice age is forming there. He also discovers global warming is occurring all over the world! The friends are stuck in New York as the father tries to go and save them along with great peril.The special effects in this film is brilliant. A great part in the movie is when a huge wave washes over New York. Your eyes will be amazed over all of the action sequences in the film. Gyllenhaal's, Rossum's, and Quaid's performances are great. This is a first rate edge-of-your-seats thriller! The beginning starts off with a cool action sequence where Quaid's character and a group of his friend falls in cracks of ice.Of coarse, there are clichés in the film. There are extreme peril in the film that will make your heart racing fast. This film is long. It's over two hours long but it won't bother you as you feel for some characters to not die. This is a great popcorn flick for the summer and will not leave you disappointed.This is not a classic but it's a great movie. Expect a great thrill ride when you walk up to the 50 foot screen TV, like me, and enjoy yourself as much as you can!",8,0,0,18 March 2006

","After Elizabeth, Will, and Captain Barbossa rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from the clutches of the Kraken, they must face their foes, Davey Jones and Lord Cutler Beckett. Beckett, now with control of Jones' heart, forms a dark alliance with him in order to rule the seas and wipe out the last of the Pirates.

I've then rewatched the first film, almost forgetting the second. Now I'm watching the third which remembering only the first film. Did that help me understand any part of this film? Most of it, absolutely not. It was so confusing, I didn't even know what was happening. Okay, well, I needed the internet's help to resolve all of this problem.*10 minutes later* Okay, I get it now but I really think they should make it clearer for the audience. So, the beginning of the movie was a really good 'attention getter' for the audience. You know how they say, if the people don't have fun, you don't? Well, my audience didn't laugh at some certain scenes, and they sounded bored. With that, I was very bored with this movie. In fact, number two could have been boring, but since the audience was actually getting into the movie, I was having fun with the second. So I'm being fair with this third movie.I could let the boring scenes go away. There were some great action scenes in the film. In this film's third act, whenever you were bored throughout the movie, you could actually forgive it for being boring because in this act, it's really fun and filled with special effects and swashbuckling action!I liked the weird acting by Johnny Depp. I also think, while not as good as Depp's, that Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's acting were good, if not great. The special effects in this film is really great.It depends if you'll enjoy this movie. If you have a great audience, you'll probably love this. If you have this boring audience, like I did, you'll be so bored but you'll forgive it for having its last hour really entertaining, although it's a bit too long.",5,1,3,28 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," It's Different and Darker
","The highly anticipated final chapter of the popular Spider-Man trilogy sees Peter and Mary Jane finally together, but three new enemies, the Sandman, Venom and Spidey's old enemy, the New Goblin, his best friend, Harry Osborn, threatens the lives of people close to Peter.I don't know if I could include this in one of the best superhero films ever but this is a very good one. In contrast with the critics who didn't like the film because of too many plot lines, too many villains, and just too long, I have to disagree with them.Yeah, I believe it was too long but I really thought it was great for them to make more plot lines to finally solve the sub plots from the last 2 movies. And I love the fact that there are more villains, which means more action. The action scenes are very good in the film, as you can suspect. You can feast your eyes on the fantastic visuals from the beginning credits to the last battle scene at the end. Oh, and it's darker meaning the small family film from the first two movies is gone. It's more adultish right now.One problem with the movie is that the pacing is too fast. It's the beginning of the movie and about 10 minutes later, there's a huge fight sequence. Yeah, I like that but there are a lot of action in this movie. I also didn't like the fact that most of the characters of the film is changed. Their personalities had changed. Mary Jane isn't the sweet girl anymore and so on...As you can also suspect, there are the cameos from Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell, which surprisingly both have a longer screening time and actually has talking roles, well, for Stan Lee and a longer talking role for Bruce Campbell. The acting by Tobey Maguire was decent but nothing great like the second one.This film is already a box office hit and you might as well see it to participate in the film's breaking record in the box office. If you haven't seen the first two films and you want to see this, I should tell you the credit scene in the beginning spoils the first two film. This film isn't the best in the series (not better than 2) but it's certainly better than the first movie.",5,0,2,7 May 2007
Zodiac," Engaging and Intriguing
","A serial killer in the San Francisco Bay Area taunts police with his letters and cryptic messages. We follow the investigators and reporters in this lightly fictionalized account of the true 1970's case as they search for the murderer, becoming obsessed with the case. Based on Robert Graysmith's book, the movie's focus is the lives and careers of the detectives and newspaper people.When there's a movie that is 158 minutes long shown to be a slasher film rather than a detective mystery, people are most likely not going to see it. The trailer looks like it's setting a movie for 16 year olds, who are expecting a slasher but end up hating it because it was something different and the people who loved to see these movies don't watch it because they'll think (when they are watching the trailer), 'Oh, not another slasher movie,' which is why, I think, Zodiac didn't make a lot of money in the box office.Well, I liked 'Se7en' a lot and I like David Fincher movies (who doesn't?). It wasn't a surprise that I loved this movie and I will call this one of the best movies of this year, beating Fincher's other detective movie. It's no doubt that this is Fincher's most mature and best work he has conceived, so far.Being a 158 minute movie, I was surprised I didn't find this movie boring. I thought at least one point in the movie, it was going to be slow and a bit too long but it wasn't. Well, maybe it is a bit too long but I was still engaged and intrigued. This thriller isn't very out there with its storytelling but it works by the dialog and tense and suspenseful scenes, which had no music to play in the background.The killing scenes are great, but there aren't many. Like I said, it's not a slasher film. When watching this movie, you'll get pulled inside, like you're, yourself, a detective on this case and that you are trying to solve it, too. I also love the look of the film, being as the movie takes place around 1969-1976, if I remember.No, this film doesn't have car chases. This movie doesn't have shootouts. This movie doesn't trick the audience with the usual 'twist' ending. This makes the film authentic and not like other movies. The performances in here are subtle, and not really fantastic, which I really do not mind.Zodiac is frightening and suspenseful at times, but the best thing about it is that it alludes and intrigues, the viewer. It doesn't cheat them nor will makes them disappointed. Fans of 'Se7en', or David Fincher, must see this.",10,6,11,13 October 2007
The Prestige," Pay Close Attention
","In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier, his beloved wife Julia McCullough and Alfred Borden are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.After seeing 'The Illusionist,' which I thought was amazing a magic movie can get, I held my expectations really high for 'The Prestige.' I'm comparing these two films because they were released close to each other, with a similar genre as magic films. Which is the better movie, you ask? 'The Illusionist' blows 'The Prestige' away.I'm starting to wonder why this film has such a high rating. Probably a lot of fans of Christopher Nolan, who is known for making great films, such as 'batman Begins' and 'Memento.' I would say this movie is just mediocre, and not at the level of his usual films.I will say this film has style. The cinematography was great. What I was disappointed by this film is the on going predictable-ness. I might be in the majority when I said this. I saw the twist coming. What came from the very first scene in the film was a great 'pay attention to the movie!' moment but it went downhill from there.Throughout the film, you'll find yourself laughing at least two times from two very laughable and improbable scenes. Other than that, the film tries to be clever and trying to create something new at the same time. But all fails. It's mediocre at best from the storytelling. The performances were decent, in the end.Overall, I found it a hard film to love and to watch over and over again (they say watching this film over and over again will make it better). The visual effects were good, the plot may give you some disbelief, and the film is just one step back for Nolan. It's a worthy rent, at least.",6,1,4,7 February 2008
The Terminator," Not That GREAT of a Movie
","A cyborg is sent from the future on a deadly mission. He has to kill Sarah Connor, a young woman whose life will have a great significance in years to come. Sarah has only one protector - Kyle Reese - also sent from the future. The Terminator uses his exceptional intelligence and strength to find Sarah, but is there any way to stop the seemingly indestructible cyborg?This film is smart, maybe ingenious toward the ending, but it's no where near a great or fantastic film. Just because the ending was good doesn't mean it's a masterpiece. This film delivers the action you want, some humorous scenes, and some suspenseful scenes.I liked the acting by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton, while Michael Biehn wasn't in their league. For a 1984 film, this film has a good number of action scenes, probably a good look of the future world and the robots are good looking.This villain in the film (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) is one of the famous villains ever and that stands a strong point in the film, along with the story and the acting but it wasn't all that great as a classic but you'll have fun when watching the movie.",7,2,4,12 May 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Saving the world is a hell of a job
","In this continuation to the adventure of the demon superhero, an evil elf breaks an ancient pact between humans and creatures, as he declares war against humanity. He is on a mission to release The Golden Army, a deadly group of fighting machines that can destroy the human race. As Hell on Earth is ready to erupt, Hellboy and his crew set out to defeat the evil prince before The Golden Army can destroy humanity's existence.When the first scenes rolled through the film, my jaw dropped. I was already disappointed by the film. The first scene shows Hellboy being a little boy and John Hurt as his father making a cameo role. It seemed kinda childish and not funny at all. The next scene doesn't do any good either. It shows Hurt telling a Christmas story which is all in Lego-like form. Definitely cheesy.But it's obvious I was taken aback by the shift in tone from this film. This felt like 'Shrek 2,' which is the best example I can give here. The first movie took itself very seriously, yet the sequel, although still serious, is very laid back. It took some time to get used to this but I eventually gave in and I came out having the time of my life! This film is immensely entertaining from beginning to end, I can tell you right now. For being not as serious and more laid back, the movie is more entertaining and better by a notch or two. I was kinda upset how they took out Rupert Evans (Myers) out of this movie but I understand that the movie is trying to have this movie about the creatures and not the humans, which is good, I guess.The originality and variety of the creatures in here are fantastic. Guillermo del Toro's wide use of imagination is simply brilliant and can be seen as hard proof by seeing this movie. There's also one or two brilliant action sequences that absolutely blew me away in awe because of its ingenious thought. Many of the actors reprise their roles with one new added cast member, played by *gasp* Seth MacFarlane! He did, simply stated, a fantastic job as the voice of his character. Everyone else also did a great job with their 3-dimensional characters.As I end this review, I'm going to say this film surprised me. Yeah, maybe the new tone of relaxation is going to be getting used to and some probably won't buy it at all but in the end, many people will enjoy it. The film is entertaining throughout, has a great use of imagination, some fantastic action sequences, great characters, and everything else you would wanted in a summer blockbuster!",9,8,10,19 November 2008
Cloverfield," Blair Witch With Godzilla!
","Five young New Yorkers throw their friend a going-away party the night that a monster the size of a skyscraper descends upon the city. Told from the point of view of their video camera, the film is a document of their attempt to survive the most surreal, horrifying event of their lives.With an ingenious trailer from J.J. Abrams himself, along with clever marketing, all of us can assume that the film may not be as good as the trailer and marketing. Well, we were wrong. Not only is the film as clever as the trailer, it's also a lot of fun! It's nice to see a great film in January, don't you agree?If you are still in doubt of seeing the film, let me continue on my review. Here's my take on the whole handy cam: Using this in the film makes it feel so realistic. During the action scenes, you feel like you're really there! I know a lot of people said this before but it really does! My only complaint is that it's sometimes annoying when the whole camera shakes around. Some might get stomach cramps.As for the production values, they are really well done. The visual effects are amazing. The action scenes are unbelievable. What else can I say? If you're worried about not seeing the monster, don't. You'll see it. You'll see it up close. And I thought I would never say this but I really like the character development! I would never though character development could take place in a handy cam.I'm also surprised to say, when we feel like we're there, that I actually felt scared. I had chills in my spine when something bad is happening. I laughed when characters popped up jokes. I felt sad when characters died. Also, there's no origin to this story, if you're looking for it. The performances by the unknown cast is above average. The most notable, is Lizzy Caplan, all the way.It's just a big monster movie! So, the film is entertaining, funny, sad, scary, heart-pulsing...The handy cam was a great idea and the action great! What else would you want from a monster movie? This is the movie to see this week! Watch it now!",8,1,4,19 January 2008
Silent Hill," Great Visuals Doesn't Save This From a Crappy Movie
","Routed from sleepwalking problems, Rose Da Silva decides to take her daughter Sharon to the town she talks about in her sleep, Silent Hill, to face her nightmares, where Sharon goes missing and Rose must fight the power of the town to get her back.No, I'm not a fan of the game. No, I haven't played the game before. May I assume that you have to play the video game to like or even understand this confusing film? Doom seemed completely understandable to me but this film is very confusing and is very bad, indeed.I have to point out the lighting in this film is very bad because many scenes are completely dark that you can't see anything which doesn't make you feel scared of the violent moments. Does darkness make anything scary?And one last bad thing I have to point out in this film is the score. It's a variety of rock and classical? I couldn't tell but it sure didn't ante up the suspense. One very good thing this film has is the visual effects with the cinematography. Those are very above average, still, it done't make up from the film's cons.The acting by Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, and Laurie Holden were decent. Aside from the cinematography and visual effects, this film is very bad. If you're a fan of the game, you'll probably like it. If not, you'll be very confused with the movie.",3,1,2,21 April 2007
Hotel Rwanda," One of the Best Films...Ever
","There are two sides: Hutu (considered the bad people in the film) and Tutsis (considered the refugees in the film). So it's kinda like the Nazi's trying to erase the race of the Jews but it's the Hutus trying to erase the Tutsis. Now explaining that, this film is about Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who housed over a thousand Tutsis refugees during their struggle against the Hutu militia in Rwanda.This is an absolutely great and inspirational film. This film is gripping and heart-gripping. There are very tense scenes and this is a very sad film, although I didn't cry.The acting by Don Cheadle is very good and so is Sophie Okonedo's acting. I can't even believe the world didn't see this being taken place. What's up with that?Anyway, this is one of the best film of this year or even ever. The acting by the main characters were solid and this film should be watched.",9,0,0,9 February 2007
Fast & Furious 6," Movin' on up!
","While most franchises lose their steam with each succeeding sequel, the Fast and the Furious franchise is that rare exception where its later films breathe in new life into the series. Once a franchise about car racing, 'Fast Five' took an unexpected turn as a bank heist thriller in the vein of Steven Soderbergh's 'Ocean's 11,' a welcomed change as seen by its huge box office earnings and critical success. Now, 'Furious 6' is neither about car racing nor bank heists, but rather a terrorist threat with obvious inspirations from 'The Dark Knight.' Like 'Fast Five,' the results are immensely satisfying and undeniably entertaining.The key to the franchise's upward turn in quality is due to director Justin Lin. He is a skilled action director, and many filmmakers can learn a few things or two from him: The action sequences are impressive, engaging, comprehensible, and well-shot, with practical effects to boot. There is a sense of danger, verve, and life in these scenes rarely found in other films, despite how over-the-top and ridiculous they may be; and yes, they often drift into gratify-defying territory. While I usually don't react out loudly when watching a film, this film had me gasping, jaw dropping, laughing, and applauding, sometimes all at once!Another ingredient to the film's success is the chemistry between the cast members. We have grown to love these characters over the course of the series that one cannot help but cheer on for them. In particular, Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have such a terrific rapport with each other that they provide some of the film's biggest laughs and memorable one-liners. Additionally, Luke Evans is definitely a step up above the previous film's antagonist, and Gina Carano provides some great ass-kicking moments, although not much performance-wise. On another note, I want to mention how refreshing it is to see minority actors fill these roles. Certainly, the film's use of a diverse ensemble cast should be commended. As for the story, it's nothing special, but I dare you not to act surprised when several plot twists are revealed; I did so more than I would like to admit.If there's one thing to learn about this franchise, it's that some change can be a good thing. While the later sequels do focus away from the car racing, they still featured cars, which helped retain old fans while bringing in new ones. 'Furious 6' is terrific entertainment, and judging by yet another dazzling cliffhanger and the audience's reaction, 'Fast & Furious 7' will be an amazing finale for the series. Unfortunately, Justin Lin won't be back around for the last installment, but someone please get this man to direct every and all upcoming action flicks.",7,149,305,16 May 2013
Scary Movie 2," A Decent Sequel
","A group of teens are tricked by their professor into visiting a haunted house for a school project. Now, the house is filled with secrets and ghosts.This film pokes fun of many horror films, including The Exorcist, Poltergeist, The Haunting, and What Lies Beneath. The prologue, like any other Scary Movie films, spoofs The Exorcist. It was funny and gross.The acting is some-what good but a film like this only focuses on the jokes, which is a good thing. This film made me laugh so hard at some scenes and others were tend to be too gross and not funny at all.Unlike David Zucker's Scary movie films, the Wayans push their Scary Movie films to be rated R. Their jokes can go far as they want it. It can be as crude, gross, or sexual as they want it. Some may like their style better than David Zucker's so it just depends on which team you like.This is the worst, not meaning bad, film of the series. Yeah, it gives out some big laughs but it wasn't as funny as the other three films in the franchise. The team are trying too hard to pull for the joke. Fans of the Scary Movie films might be disappointed by this sequel.",6,5,12,4 December 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Innocence Has A Power Evil Cannot Imagine
","This is the story of a young girl who travels with her pregnant mother to live with her mother's new husband in a rural area up North in Spain, 1944, after Franco's victory. The girl lives in an imaginary world of her own creation and faces the real world with much chagrin. Fascist repression during the first years of Franco's dictatorship is at its height in rural Spain and the girl must come to terms with that through a fable of her own.I am happy to say this is the first film I have read subtitles instead of hearing other actors talk in English. It's not that bad, really. I also have to say this film is very depressing, showing the ill-mannered actions during a war era.This film will take you in the movie, making you experience something you never had before. It's very imaginative, with great special effects, a great production designs and some camera work. This film is very dark, and although I'm just a teen, don't let children watch this movie.There are some scenes where I think it was unnecessary to add the violence and blood. Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, this is probably his best film to date. I liked the acting by Ivana Baquero, Sergi López, and Maribel Verdú.This is a worthy film in Guillermo del Toro's collection of movies he had made. It's one of the best film in 2006 and should be seen by people who love great films. It's emotional, suspenseful, and magical!",10,2,5,28 May 2007
Final Destination 2," There's Going to be a Huge Accident!
","This film is about Kimberly and her friends going to take the time off and spend their time going on a vacation. She drives the car and sees disturbing things that hints as a car accident. A truck is carrying logs in which the logs slides on the street killing many people in a gruesome pile up. While Kimberly and her friends are on the ground, in the car, another big truck, filled with flames, goes to her and before it crashes, Kimberly wakes up in a vivid dream.She blocks the road so the cars behind her wouldn't go. An officer spots this and questions why she's doing this. She tries to explain she had a dream that a pile up just happened. Then before long, the truck with the logs kill the other cars in the highway. She saves 10 people for that but three of her friends automatically dies at the beginning where another car crashes into them. Now 7, including Kimberly, are left. Suddenly, the survivors get killed one by one by gruesome accidents. Now Kimberly has to find a way to stop this before Death kills her.If you haven't noticed, this film has the exact same concept and plot in this movie as its original. On the contrary, it doesn't take itself too seriously, much funnier, smarter, and more elaborate and gruesome deaths. It's much lighter. Well, yeah, there are a few weeping scenes but I think this film was made to entertain the audience and not tire them with the over dramatic scenes.This film takes place one year from the original. The deaths, as stated above, are more elaborate and gruesome, which makes the film better. The clues that foreshadow each death are now more elaborate and I love the score in here, which is even more brooding and suspenseful than the one in the original that this film is even more thrilling. I acting by A.J. Cook is great.Basically, this film puts everything up a notch: The death, the premonition sequence (which has probably the best car accident scenes you'll ever see in your entire life!), the much needed humor, the intelligence, more characters to love, etc. I would call this a guilty pleasure and I love it THAT much! See the movie if you don't care if it's a repeat of the original.",7,0,0,18 March 2006
Blade II," A Great Solid Action Horror
","Reapers, a new breed of vampire that feed off humans and vampires, emerge with plans for world domination and Blade must team with the Bloodpack, an elite team of vampire warriors specifically trained to hunt him, in order to defeat this new menace.This is one of your different horror film. It's not scary because it has action! Maybe it's not that different, although it has a good plot. From this trilogy, I would say this is probably the best but I can't count on that, yet. Here's my explanation: I've only seen part of the first film, not even finishing it. Then I watched the third. Then I watched the first and didn't even finish it (again). Then I watched the second! So yeah, the whole series was a mix up.I like the way how this film can be seen without watching the first film because it helps explain the whole movie during the beginning, so it was not a problem watching this movie at all. This is a very fun and entertaining popcorn film! The action scenes are well made, with the use of the L-camera (is that how they call it?) and great choreography and CGI.Horror fans would also get to see some great kills and some squeamish scenes. This film is not meant to use realism. It's just to have fun. Wesley Snipes' acting was generally good as well as Leonor Varela. The creature and production design were all great.This is a different Guillermo del Toro work but it is a worthy addition. It's entertaining with the great action scenes and it's also filled with emotion (towards the end). Not scary, but if you want to watch an entertaining popcorn film, this is for you.",8,0,2,7 June 2007
Knocked Up," Save the due date
","Slobby Ben and up and coming career girl Alison meet at a bar, and end up having a one night stand. Eight weeks later, Ben is shocked when Alison meets him and reveals that she is pregnant. Despite having little in common, the two decide that they have to at least try to make some kind of relationship work for the baby's sake.It's a funny thing: I wanted to watch this movie when it came out in theater...well, I didn't. So a week passed. Noww I don't feel as enthusiastic about watching it, wanting to save money and wait for other summer movies. Well, I watched it and, although not great, it was a well made movie.It's like Scary Movie 4, having a joke per minute, but I find myself chuckle through most of it, since I'm more into comedies like Scary Movie 4, where I laugh at the physical and toilet gags rather than the ones in this movie. I know adults would love this movie, seeming that this is their kind of taste.This movie is also sweet and endearing, showing family and marriage. I liked the acting by Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl, who both give a real 'opposites attract' kind of people. I also loved the supporting roles by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann.This is a worthy comedy, laughing out loud at some jokes, but chuckling at many. They could have tone down the sex and nudity but this is a sweet comedy not for the family.",10,1,4,9 June 2007
Alien," 90 Minutes of Terror
","When commercial towing vehicle Nostromo, heading back to Earth, intercepts an SOS signal from a nearby planet, the crew are under obligation to investigate. After a bad landing on the planet, some crew members leave the ship to explore the area. At the same time as they discover a hive colony of some unknown creature, the ship's computer deciphers the message to be a warning, not a call for help. When one of the eggs is disturbed, the crew do not know the danger they are in until it is too late.So, like every classic, I always watch them so late so there's no surprise here. I was really looking forward to the film, since it was being called a horror or sci-fi classic from people to people. But the problem with that is that the ending and some memorable scenes tend to go out in public for people who haven't seen the movie, like me.So the first 20 minutes passed. Nothing special there. I honestly thought the action would start right away because I've seen AVP before this movie so I expected things people wouldn't expect because the film was made 1979 and I've seen it in 2007. I knew the ending and I kinda knew a bit of the middle so that probably lowered my rating for this movie.One other reason why I might not give this movie a perfect rating is the clichés. Of course, if I've seen this movie in 1979, it wouldn't be called clichés but to let you know, so many movies pulled off the same clichés so I can't help myself but roll my eyes when characters do stupid things to get themselves killed.On a better note, I love this movie for its intensity, thrills, and suspense. Actually, there is one pop up scene, probably the only pop up scene, that made me yell out loud. That's how suspenseful the movie is. The death scenes are well made since you wouldn't know how they would die (but you would certainly know who would die).Sigourney Weaver's performance as the heroine was, I suppose, heroing and tough. The special effects were decent, as for the Alien design. I have to admit, though, the last 15 minutes of the movie was annoying because of the light flashing constantly on the screen, to heighten tension, of course.I wouldn't say this is the greatest movie ever. If I'd seen this in 1979, my opinion might be different, but no, this is 2007. I would say this film is a great sci-fi thriller which keeps the suspense and tension throughout. Other from that, there's nothing else to say about this movie.",9,0,1,23 August 2007
Horrible Bosses," Ever wish your boss were dead?
","For Nick, Kurt, and Dale, the only thing that would make the daily grind more tolerable would be to grind their intolerable bosses into dust. Quitting is not an option, so, with the benefit of a few-too-many drinks and some dubious advice from a hustling ex-con, the three friends devise a convoluted and seemingly foolproof plan to rid themselves of their respective employers...permanently. There's only one problem: even the best laid plans are only as foolproof as the brains behind them. -- (C) Warner BrosAs many Hitchcock films have shown us (like STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, DIAL M FOR MURDER, and VERTIGO), even the best laid plans have loopholes. No matter how perfect the plan seem to be, there's usually some incidental human error involved that messes everything up. HORRIBLE BOSSES takes this concept with a dark comedic twist, and it works really well! Even with the mean-spirited feel of the film that has been so common among comedies these days, the film successfully contains consistent laughs through and through, which already puts it above 75% of comedies released in the past several years.The film works because of the TERRIFIC cast, with Charlie Day standing out the most. While he only had a supporting role in GOING THE DISTANCE, he has a much bigger role here, and he steals the freaking show! He does everything in here to get some big laughs from the audience, and he doesn't disappoint. I can easily see him in a starring role within the next few years. I also enjoyed Jason Sudeikis' antics as the sex-addicted friend. However, I didn't think Jason Bateman was any special. He's just Jason Bateman.It's great to see Jennifer Aniston in a different role, although she's still in a comedy. It was refreshing to see her with a sexy, skanky attitude (matched with her darker brunette hair) compared to her several previous 'good girl' roles. Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell also seemed to have tons of fun playing baddies as well. With a short screen presence, Jamie Foxx continues the pattern with delivering some good laughs.Story-wise, HORRIBLE BOSSES has its shares of ups and downs. The upside is that you really don't know how the film will end. I thought I knew where it was going, but then a plot twist came up to surprise me which took the film in a completely different direction. The downside is that the film contains some plot contrivances that were really hard to swallow and an all-too-convenient, abrupt ending to top it all. I didn't want it to end so soon.With those minor flaws, HORRIBLE BOSSES is not only better than 'horrible,' it's a lot better than 'horrible.' In fact, it's quite good -- a dark comedy that delivers some really great laughs due to the excellent cast that manages to give it their all into making a good film. In the end, HORRIBLE BOSSES, while not amazing, is better and more memorable than most modern comedies these days.",7,2,7,5 July 2011
The Polar Express," I Believe!
","This film is about a boy, who once believed in Christmas, going on a journey on a magical train that leads him and a couple of children to the North Pole.He doesn't believe in Santa Clause anymore, since he saw the newspapers and news that Santa was a fake. He's doubting everything including the magic train and going to the North Pole. He meets some friends. The animation is great. It's used by actors and actresses playing the characters that are in the film. The movement they do is in the film. Hanks plays four different characters: The Conductor, Dad, the Boy, the Bum, and Santa Clause.This film is really entertaining. There is major peril all over the movie and when you look at it, it's so amazing to see it. You are in awe and in shock, as you see the amazing visuals. The technology is great today that you can almost do anything with it. This could also be a sad film towards the end. The train is going to the North Pole where the first person will receive their gift before any other people in the world.This is an amazing film. It might be too scary for small children but it's OK with young kids and adults. Not many people are proud of this film but they should be. This is a great piece of artwork.",10,2,4,23 December 2005
Elf," A Great Family and Holiday Film
",This film is about a man (Farrel) who had just learned that he was born human! He never knew that he was human and he imagined that he was an elf the whole time! Now he needs to search for his biological father instead of his elf father. He finds him but his father won't believe it. They take a DNA test and you know what? He is his father! I must say this film entertained me a lot! It' actually really funny and I wasn't expecting from it that much. This film made me cry from its sweet moments. This is also a great film for the family looking for a great Christmas movie to watch. The adults won't get bored and the kids will have the time of their lives! The special effects are great to see. I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen this movie to see it!,7,2,3,23 December 2005
Shutter Island," Someone is missing.
","SHUTTER ISLAND is the story of two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, who are summoned to a remote and barren island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a murderess from the island's fortress-like hospital for the criminally insane.SHUTTER ISLAND is Martin Scorsese's first jab at doing a horror/thriller-type film since CAPE FEAR. However, there's no doubt that the film will disappoint many who are expecting a straight up horror film as the TV spots and trailers suggest. In fact, it's further from the truth. At its heart, SHUTTER ISLAND is all about atmosphere and the building of uneasiness, which, at times, do fail to work. It's not a perfect film, at least for me. It's far from it. I found the pacing to be slow at times and the mystery didn't quite pull me in as I expected it to be. Director Martin Scorsese also seem to have a hard time trying to build up suspense, especially towards the end.I also found it to be a frustrating movie experience, but I say that as a compliment. The film does get it at you in the head with the intentional inconsistent editing of scenes and making the viewers very confused with what the film has to offer. In the end, however, Scorsese manages to put all of the puzzle pieces together without cheating the audience. Sure, some might find the ending to be very bad and others might find it very obvious, but there just can't be a movie that everyone ends up liking.I loved how Scorsese refrained from using clichés from certain scenes that begs to have clichés be used. You know those scenes where the music builds up to a huge pop up scare? Well, there's none of that here. Scorsese lets the scenes play out for themselves, rarely using any building up of music at all. This is how he achieves the tone and atmosphere of the film. It's the working relationship between the cinematographer, production designers, director, actors, etc that molds every scene together which is one reason for this film to stand out on its own.The film brings along a lovely cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives it his all in here. He gives a terrific performance even as his mental state breaks down as the film progresses. Ben Kingsley does a great job in here as well along with a few scenes by Michelle Williams in her Boston accent and Emily Mortimer. Patricia Clarkson also shines through with her brief but important role. The film is also visually stunning. It's obvious that attention was put in every detail of a set and every other thing surrounding it.SHUTTER ISLAND is a film that is handled with precision and care, although sometimes losing it's focus on the big picture. It's not an Oscar-worthy film as some might hope it to be, but I enjoyed the psychological game Scorsese plays with in the audience's minds and the film's overall haunting story and tone. See this film if you like to enjoy a psychological thriller with a good story that supports a great cast and a fantastic director.",7,3,7,20 February 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," Better than Most Comedies
","Andy Sachs is a young woman who looks for a job in New York as a journalist but instead, she becomes a naive young woman working as an assistant to one of the city's biggest magazine editors, the ruthless and cynical, more like the Devil, Miranda Priestly.This is a funny film. It's very similar to the hit TV show, Ugly Betty. Meryl Streep gives an Oscar-worthy performance. She should get nominated for an Oscar. The film wouldn't be as good film Meryl Streep wasn't in. Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, and Stanley Tucciall has great performances, too.Unlike many comedies, this film is unpredictable. Miranda Priestly is a boss that you can think that would be as mean as you can see without even raising her voice or look angry.I haven't read the book for the film but heard the film was better. If you like good, smart comedies, you should go see this film and it's not a chick flick.",7,1,2,31 December 2006
Lion," Not just another Oscar bait movie
","Do you know the feeling you get when you go into a film with no expectations at all or thinking it might be decent, and the film turns out to not only be good, but blows you away by how amazing it ends up being? That's LION, and if you've been watching films for several years like me thinking you've seen everything committed to cinema, it's a fantastic feeling to be proved wrong.Let me explain to you exactly what I experienced while watching LION: Almost half of the film is in Hindi, which lends incredible authenticity to the story, not that BS where they have actors in which English is their second language speak English for the sake of sparing the American audience from reading subtitles (I'm looking at you, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and every other Hollywood movie ever made). In fact, the entire first act takes place in India, where about 40 minutes of the film rides on the shoulders of a first time child actor – played by the wonderful Sunny Pawar – and it's one of the best first acts I've seen in years. Think of it like the silent first act of Wall-E; it feels like it can be its own film, yet the filmmakers do a great job connecting the story once Dev Patel comes on screen.On top of that, the filmmaking is impressive. The script is fantastic, the cinematography is lush, the soundtrack complements the film really nicely, and the pacing is on point where it rarely feels like it's dragging, despite the story taking place over the course of 25 years. Every actor in here is also terrific in their roles. As stated earlier, Sunny Pawar makes a compelling lead for the first third of the film. If Oscars were given to kid actors, he would have a damn good chance at winning one. For the last two thirds, Dev Patel more than carries the rest of the film, giving an emotionally naked performance worthy enough to top his role in SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE. Finally, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman, and David Wenham are ace, despite all of them having limited screen time.In a time where diversity is being talked about more in the film industry, LION makes a compelling case for having diversity in storytelling. It's not about a guy meeting his girlfriend's parents for the first time. It's not about a group of friends going in a cabin in the woods. It's not even about a guy/girl struggling with the death of his/her father/mother/son/daughter/dog. No, LION is a personal story unique to South Asians growing up in India, and it's refreshing and easily one of the best films the year has to offer. Don't dismiss this as yet another Oscar bait movie put out by the Weinstein Company – it probably is one. But the film is much more than that. With a distinct vision from director Garth Davis, LION offers an enthralling story that deserves to be seen by everyone.",9,399,449,19 October 2016
Romeo + Juliet," At Least It's Better Than the Original
","Shakespeare's famous play is updated to the hip modern suburb of Verona still retaining its original dialog. The gun-toting members of the families wage a vicious war on the streets as the star-crossed lovers, their tragic destiny.When I saw the first 10 minutes of the film, I thought it would be one of the worst movies ever made! It even made the original look like a masterpiece! But when I continue watching it, it actually gets better and better, but not by a whole lot.First, I probably like this film because of the modern update. I didn't like the play that Shakespeare wrote but this one actually manages the descents for me to recommend it. This film is loud, exaggerated, and bombastic! At first, those were meant to be bad things in the movie but as it progresses, I liked it.The acting in the film is much better in this film than the original (by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes). I also liked the bizarre set pieces and songs throughout the film. It gives itself a hint of originality to it. I even thought the ending was much better.I'm not a fan of the play. Maybe you don't have to listen to my review. I liked this version somewhat better than the original because of its fresh feel. It's not a masterpiece but it's decent enough for a rent.",4,0,1,3 May 2007
Captain America: The First Avenger," Discover the origin of the first avenger.
","Captain America: The First Avenger will focus on the early days of the Marvel Universe when Steve Rogers volunteers to participate in an experimental program that turns him into the Super Soldier known as Captain America. As Captain America, Rogers joins forces with Bucky Barnes and Peggy Carter to wage war on the evil HYDRA organization, led by the villainous Red Skull -- (C) ParamountOut of all superhero films that have come out this year, Captain America is not only the best one, but is also the only one that I actually liked. Now, some might argue that X-Men: First Class was fantastic (I am NOT a fan of Thor), but, while not bad, I felt it didn't reach its potential. As for Captain America, its main distinction to other summer films is that it doesn't dive right into the action. I appreciated the time it took to develop its characters, and, gee, there actually seemed to be a story going on here. I also have to warn those of you who might expect a straight up action flick to not get your hopes high. Although it didn't bother me, it does take a while before an action scene actually appears.Another distinction that separates itself from other superhero films is the look of the film, coinciding its setting in 1942. Captain America looks and feels like an old-fashion film, and I really embraced it. This is also due to Alan Silvestri's score, which feels more classic than modern film scores. Our protagonist, Steve Rogers, feels like a real person which adds an emotional weight to the film. We feel for him and want him to succeed in his goal. And once the story is set up and the action finally comes to play, the action doesn't seem to appear for action's sake. It actually propels the story. It also doesn't hurt having a romance brewing between him and Peggy Carter. It was sweet and didn't feel forced to me.Chris Evans plays the title character and he's great playing both the skinny, average Joe and the buff, all-American hero. He certainly steps up his performance here compared to his other superhero character, Johnny Storm. He brings a sort of charisma and puppy dog charm to his role, and it seems like an automatic response to be on his side when we first meet his character. Hayley Atwell is totally believable as his love interest as well. I would love to see what other things she has to offer in future roles. With all good superhero films, there must be a villain to match it. In that case, it's not surprising that Hugo Weaving doesn't disappoint. Just as the person he is, he can withhold an audience's attention without even trying.I also liked the relationship between Evans and Sebastian Stan, who plays his best friend. It felt authentic. Tommy Lee Jones brings a few laughs as well. Playing Tony Stark's father, Dominic Cooper thankfully doesn't feel like an Iron Man character being in an Avenger's flick just to string in the Avenger characters together because Thor and Iron Man 2 felt like films made just for the Avengers flick rather than individual films themselves. Stanley Tucci is good in a small role, although the German accent does push it a little.With a good story, great characters, great action scenes, and an involving narrative, Captain America is definitely a hit for Marvel Studios. The unique 1940s setting also sets itself apart from other superhero films, and Chris Evans is terrific in the title role. Captain America doesn't feel like your usual popcorn summer flick, and maybe it's a good thing it isn't. Also, stay after the credits to see a cool Avengers trailer.",8,9,22,23 July 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Probably the Best Threequal of this Summer!
","Bourne dodges new, superior assassins as he searches for his unknown past while a government agent tries to track him down. So we're on this last chapter of this trilogy. Last time we saw Bourne, he was mourning over the death of his lover and obsessing over a black-ops program code-named Treadstone. In this film, he's still mourning and still obsessing to find out who he is. Caution for those who are going to see this: Please, go to the bathroom before you watch this film. You may never want to get up again until it ends.This movie will grab your attention from the beginning and will never let you go until the end. This is a fantastic kinetic spy thriller. You can't help but admit this is one of the few best spy thrillers you've ever seen. There's finally a mature movie not for the teens to go wild on. Like the other two films, this is still intelligent. The action scenes are still relentless. We're still hopping from one country to another. But there are some moments in which is repeats itself from the second film. I'm not giving anything away.If you've seen interviews from cast members of this movie, they're trying to keep it secretive. By the time you have finished this, you would know why. This third entrance of the series, based on Robert Ludlum's novels, lacks the emotion from the second, replacing with the questions 'Who am I?' and 'Why am I?'.Matt Damon' performance is excellent. He seems to suffer without actually doing anything, which is a rare gift for an actor. Other returning cast members are Julia Stiles and Joan Allen, which both give good performances. There are also new cast members, most notably David Strathairn.With every chase after chase, we get to enjoy Oliver Wood's cinematography, shaking here and there. The scenery from each country is great. The action sequences are terrific that one has no dialog for at least fifteen minutes. Paul Greengrass also proves us once again that he's a great filmmaker. There's also the same score we heard from the second film, which was good.This film does not drag. The film is gripping and suspenseful all along the way. The sound work is amazingly done with the ear-splitting car accidents and every idea creative. The action is great and you'll get to know everything. So why not watch it? I don't know. Everyone is going to watch it.",9,1,2,15 August 2007
Fargo," Hey, This is a Simple Story Told in a Great Way
","Jerry Lundegaard is in a financial jam and, out of desperation, comes up with a plan to hire someone to kidnap his wife and demand ransom from her wealthy father, to be secretly split between Jerry and the perpetrators. Jerry, who is not the most astute of individuals, hires a couple of real losers from the frozen northern reaches of Fargo, North Dakota for the job. Then things begin to slip from bad to worse as Jerry helplessly watches on.Before I say anything, I would like to say I've seen the edited television version, so I don't know if it is different from the theatrical version. When I watch this movie, it says it is based on a true story and after I finished watching it, I had a hard time believing it, but still, it was a fantastic film.This whole movie is like a kidnapping plot gone wrong. Although there are some dark subjects in the film, there were some pretty funny moments (that's why calling it a comedy thriller). Like any great movie, the script for this one is written really well and the characters aren't one dimensional.I like the dialog so much, that I just love it! I never really thought dialog could be written this well. The characters are fantastic! You, or I, can fall in love with every one of them, just because of those well written lines.This isn't your ordinary kidnapping film (or maybe it is. I haven't seen that many). This film looks so original and different in a kind of way. It's also very heartbreaking and I also liked how the movie ended. It felt complete and satisfying.William H. Macy's performance is really weird but was really good. It's probably because of the weird personality. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare performances were subtle, but not bad. And my favorite character of all is played wonderfully by Frances McDormand.This is one of the best movies ever made. The whole movie was shot really well and the dialog was fantastic. The characters were lovable and the whole movie was really satisfying. Watch it, people. I guarantee you will love it as much as I do.",10,0,0,28 July 2007
Burn After Reading," A disk containing the memoirs of a CIA agent ends up in the hands of two unscrupulous gym employees who attempt to sell it.
","After last year's 'No Country for Old Men,' the Coen brothers decided to take a lighter turn (not really) by directing 'Burn After Reading.' What can I say about this movie? Well, it reminded me a lot of 'Fargo.' They're both dark comedies. As you can predict, this film would probably not be their best film to date. However, it's still a really good film.What I loved about this movie is that it's filled with coincidences. I love these type of movies. This person is friends with that person who is married to this person who's cheating with that same other person who's--you get the point. Seeing this, of course it's going to be confusing if you don't have a paper to write every characters' name down and what relationship they have with the others. But it's not that confusing if you'd think hard enough. It's all part of the fun.Frances McDormand has, yet again, created a lovable quirky character. John Malkovich, George Clooney, and Tilda Swinton all do a decent job with their roles. However, who stood out the most was Brad Pitt. Other than Heath Ledger's fantastic performance as the Joker in 'The Dark Knight,' I think Pitt should get nominated as a supporting role. He's that good because you have never seen him act like the character he plays in your entire life. He also provides a lot of laughs in this film.Although not the Coen's best film, the movie is pretty good to what it has. It's amazingly short (about 90 minutes), which is a bad thing because I wanted it to be longer. There are equal moments of some funny bits and depressing moments but the film tries its best to lighten up the dark scenes. With it's fantastic characters and semi-confusing plot, this is a must see in the cinemas. Oh, and if you think 'Eagle Eye' created paranoia, you haven't seen this film, yet.",8,2,7,26 September 2008
Watchmen," Justice is coming to all of us. No matter what we do.
","An adaptation of Alan Moore's landmark comic book series, Watchmen is a story set in an alternative 1985, where the world is ticking closer to the brink of nuclear war, and a plot to eliminate a band of ex-crimefighters is instigated, but why? and by whom? It is up to two of those ex-crimefighters to investigate the plot that seems to go beyond the unthinkable.'Watchmen' fell into traps. The first trap was a lawsuit from 20th Century Fox to Warner Bros. For better or worse, they negotiated a deal and had the film released in its appropriate date. The second trap is from the publicity itself. Now I'm sure many beloved fans would love to see the movie, and there's no reason to blame them. However, there are many other people who have never read the graphic novel in their entire life. However, that won't stop them because the marketing looked fantastic, the trailers and commercials showing cool, zesty special effects with some cool actions scenes all directed by the cool guy who did '300,' Zack Snyder.This is the downfall. What the marketing don't show is that the film is about three hours long, has very little to no action scenes, and it's very talky. Now why is that the problem? For those who haven't read the graphic novel, including myself, they'll be stuck in a, jumbled, incoherent piece of narrative that doesn't stop until the end. Throughout the movie, I wanted to kill myself, honestly. I was so tired by the first act that even I wouldn't have cared if the movie ended or not. It just wasn't interesting. And that's what many of you non-fans will suffer through the film.I'm not saying the movie is bad. It just appeals more to the fans than account to the others. Like I said, the movie is so very long and the pace is just uneven. Action scenes come up randomly just to keep the audience awake. Other elements that would keep them awake is the visually extensive look of the film. I must say, by technical standards, the movie looks fantastic, giving a noir-neo look. Just like '300,' Snyder would get every chance he has to milk some visually creative scenes for some time.When there are some action scenes, which won't be very many, they are done very well, to say the least. Like the rest of the film, the scenes are set up perfectly to bring out the best possible response from the audience. The music choice is very odd, though. Sometimes, they work well, like the opening sequence and other times, they're downright horrible. As for the performances themselves, nobody actually stood out for me. Many are saying Jackie Earle Haley did a good job, but I found him quite annoying with his 'Christian Bale-in-Batman-form-voice.' I found him very incomprehensible that I begged for subtitles to appear to understand what he's trying to say.Overall, the film was just confusing and incoherent. I wasn't interest at all of what's going on and who's going to die. When the plot does start to move, it's sometimes very predictable on what's going happen, which is pretty ironic because the film tries to be thought-provoking. Under the messy, uneven film, one can actually see it has little to nothing to say or that it didn't say anything different from previous superhero films that have been done before already. Director Snyder has a good eye, I'll give him that, but the rest of the film just falls down from a non-fan point of view. If you're not a fan, don't bother wasting your time. After all, it's almost three hours long. If you're a fan, go ahead and watch it. Enjoy it.",7,1,5,7 March 2009
The Bourne Identity," Why Can't These Spy Films Be Easier to Understand?
","Based very loosely on Robert Ludlum's novel, the Bourne Identity is the story of a man whose wounded body is discovered by fisherman who nurse him back to health. He can remember nothing and begins to try to rebuild his memory based on clues such as the Swiss bank account, the number of which, is implanted in his hip. He soon realizes that he is being hunted and takes off with Marie on a search to find out who he is and why he is being hunted.I liked the concept of the film a lot. I liked the whole thing about the movie, but it's sometimes very confusing in my simple-headed mind. Well, it's certainly a really good spy film, I can tell you that. There were some great action scenes and some suspenseful ones too.The acting by Matt Damon and Franka Potente were good and there really isn't anything else to say about this film, since I'm not thinking well. This is a great spy movie. Go see it.",8,0,1,28 May 2007
Armageddon," A Mildy Entertaining Popcorn Film
","When an asteroid the size of Texas is headed for Earth the world's best deep core drilling team is sent to nuke the rock from the inside.I was looking forward and not looking forward to this film. You know, these kinds of 'astroid' films are usually long but this was a Michael Bay film, which is one of the best action directors out there.I was surprised that this film didn't have as much action as The Island. I know, technology had grown. Some scenes were fantastic. One problem of the film is that I don't care for the characters. I didn't care for Bruce Willis' character or any of that.Bruce Willis' performance was mediocre as the dad who don't let his daughter go out with a guy. Even the jokes in the film was kinda 'childish'. I really didn't laugh.I found films like The Core, Independence Day, and Deep Impact better films and more entertaining but this film wasn't that bad. If you would like to watch a fun film with great action scenes, I wouldn't count on that.",6,0,2,24 February 2007

","There is a small, isolated countryside village that is in the forest. They believe that there are mythical creatures that inhabit the forest around them. They align with them, but never making any contact with them. Now, the villagers believe that their alliance is coming to an end.Many of the critics say this is a very bad film. Forget about them. They're wrong. Many people watch this film to look for clues for the twist ending. That's their mistake. Don't look for clues. See this film as if this weren't made by M. Night Shyamalan. See this film like any other film you would see it.Everyone in this film gives Oscar-worthy performances with an all star cast, including Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver. The acting is excellent.The score of the film is very good, composed by Thomas Newton Howard, composing all of M. Night Shyamalan's films. The trailer is misleading. This isn't a horror type film. It's more like a suspense and a love story. That's probably why many didn't like this film.This is one of M. Night Shyamalan's best films. The film is well done and has a great cast playing solid performances. It's very touching and suspenseful. If you want to watch this film because of the twist ending, don't waste your time.

Split," 24 things you need to know about SPLIT
","1. Obviously, the first thing that should be mentioned is James McAvoy's amazing performance. He is genuinely good and convincing as he weaves in and out of vastly different personalities, sometimes in the same scene.2. Anya Taylor-Joy is a joy to watch as well. Her character has quite a bit of depth than the trailer suggests.3. Rejoice for Betty Buckley! Those who thought she was awful in THE HAPPENING will find her lovely in this film.4. As for the other two girls in the film - Haley Lu Richardson (who was wonderful in THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN) and Jessica Sula - are serviceable but not entirely memorable.5. Special shoutout to Izzie Coffey. Shyamalan always has a knack for finding talented young actors.6. My favorite personality? Hedwig. He is a delight every time he's on screen. Etcetera.7. Barry comes a close second. Seeing McAvoy play a homosexual character is as wonderful as it sounds.8. I would have liked to see more of Kevin himself.9. And in that line of thought, I would have liked to see more of the other personalities as well.10. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Not a surprise since Mike Gioulakis shot IT FOLLOWS.11. So is the score. This is Shyamalan's first parting from his go-to collaborator, James Newton Howard (unless you count Paul Cantelon's small contribution in THE VISIT). While a shame, West Dylan Thordson more than makes up for Newton Howard's absence, providing an atmospheric and surprisingly empathetic score in certain scenes.12. Most inventive opening/closing credits ever? I think so.**13. Don't let anyone spoil this movie for you. Just don't.**14. I've already seen the film twice within 5 days of each other. I liked it more the second time.15. But I still prefer THE VISIT. Some reasons:16. The climax is really underwhelming. It works thematically/symbolically, but the payoff falls short.17. On top of that, the third act itself could have been crazier.18. The structure gets repetitive.19. The runtime is a bit long as well.20. As a matter of fact, the film has many problems.21. But there are risks taken here, and SPLIT is admirable for that.22. In fact, the film goes to some truly dark territory, especially for its PG-13 rating.23. Overall thoughts? SPLIT is a really good January movie.24. But I don't doubt that audiences will be split on the film.",8,41,84,18 January 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," It All Ends Here
","Part 1 begins as Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort's immortality and destruction--the Horcruxes. On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart. (Warner Bros. Pictures)As the WB logo appeared deteriorating before my very eyes, I knew things have changed since the first HP film. Each succeeding HP film has gotten progressively darker as the series is coming to its end. HP7, the first part of the last film, doesn't change the pattern. It's a dark film, literally and figuratively. The film shows blood as if it were nothing and even the cinematography has gone shaky-cam style in some action scenes. However, being part of the last film and all, HP7 doesn't have a lot of action as one might have thought. It's arguably the slowest moving HP film to date and that's equally its main strength and downfall.Having the pace slow down quite a bit hurts the film for the most obvious reason: It meanders, especially in the second act. I actually felt like looking at my watch, which never happened to me before in the previous films. However, the film is still filled with a lot of information. Non-readers will find themselves overwhelmed by the information hurdled at them and even I, who have read the books, felt confused in parts of the film. Ironically, most of the series' best moments are in this film. That's because the slow pace allows for a lot of intimate scenes between the three young actors, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint.These three actors have grown with each passing film and it shows here. I think Watson and Grint were really at the top of their games in this film. Radcliffe, while the weakest, is good too but not as good as the other two. While I'll take intimate scenes between them over action any day, there were just some scenes that were really tedious. Still, that didn't ruin the film for me. It just bothered me. The other cast members don't appear in the film as much, but it's appropriate considering the three main actors are isolated from society. Like the previous HP films, the cinematography and production are gorgeous and the score by newcomer Alexandre Desplat brings in a fresh voice to the franchise.As a fan, I would say this is the most disappointing HP film to date, although that's no way to say the film is bad. It's a good film, but a very flawed one at that mainly due to it's slow pacing. The three actors are as great as ever and the film ends at the perfect point for part two. If you're a HP fan, there's no doubt you'll enjoy this.",9,1,2,28 November 2010
The Hills Have Eyes," Unrated Cut Review
","While traveling in a trailer to California through the New Mexico Desert, a family is misled to a shortcut going to nowhere by the owner of an isolated gas station and wrecks the car in a rock. Along the night and on the next day, they are attacked by a group of deformed cannibals, fruit of the atmospheric nuclear tests conducted by USA from 1945 to 1962 in that spot. Absolutely trapped by the psychotics, they have to fight to survive.I didn't want to watch this movie. The reason is because the critics said it sucks and it was nasty but I watched it and it was better than I thought it was but that's not saying much. Let me start with saying this: It was predictable, well, at least for me. I did not know why I knew what was going to happen (with an exceptional last 15 minutes).This movie is slow. Nothing happens in the first forty minutes or so which is kind of boring, if you ask me. When it does get moving, there are many horror clichés, throughout the film. The characters are doing stupid things to get themselves killed. Then this movie frustrates people because of these clichés. Then it turns mean spirited, killing people for their entertainment, but that's only a segment of the film.The only 'good' part in the film was actually the unpredictable last fifteen minutes. Finally, the characters do smart things and fight back, like a revenge flick. But so and so, there has to be an open sequel, which of course leads to The Hills Have Eyes II. I wonder if that film can have more clichés.I actually liked the whole performances by the whole family. They were realistic and surprisingly sympathetic when they are getting hurt. I was actually surprised there is an emotional core in the film. Not many horror films have that, these days. The character development is also good. Other good things I'll note are the creature designs and the cinematography.Horror fans will probably like this for the buckets of gore and violence. Some, like me, will not like it for the dumb characters and the clichés. It's not a scary film. It's better than what you think it is but isn't that good of a horror film.",5,0,0,2 July 2007
Kung Fu Panda 2," Prepare for the return of awesomeness
","Po is now living his dream as The Dragon Warrior, protecting the Valley of Peace alongside his friends and fellow kung fu masters, The Furious Five. But Po's new life of awesomeness is threatened by the emergence of a formidable villain, who plans to use a secret, unstoppable weapon to conquer China and destroy kung fu. Po must look to his past and uncover the secrets of his mysterious origins; only then will he be able to unlock the strength he needs to succeed. -- (C) DreamworksKUNG FU PANDA 2 is an example of a sequel that surpasses it's predecessor. Instead of repeating the plot of the first film, the creative minds behind this sequel made the rightful decision to continue expanding Po's emotional story, in this case meaning that we finally find out Po's origin story. By doing this, KUNG FU PANDA 2 feels much more emotionally involving than the first, and it just goes to show you that Dreamworks Animation have matured in the past few years, although PUSS IN BOOTS looks like it'll bring the studio back a few steps.With that being said, the film does suffer from having too many things going on at once, as if afraid that it'll bore the kids in the audience. The film moves at an lightening speed and, before you know it, the credits are rolling right in front of you. Part of this is due to the film's amazing narrative economy. For example, in the first few minutes, we have already learned the villain's origin story told in a fairytale kind of way with Michelle Yeoh as the narrator, à la THE MUMMY: TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR. I just wished the film took its time in certain parts because the film could have certainly been better if we had time to breathe.As with most sequels, everything is bigger in KUNG FU PANDA 2. This includes the action sequences, which are amazing, stunning, and wildly imaginative, all enhanced by the 3D technology and the gorgeous cinematography. The 3D also provides amazing depth in almost every scene and moments of pop out gimmicks. With a bigger scope and the ability of animators to manipulate everything on screen, the extra dimension is certainly worth the extra cost. Hans Zimmer's score is terrific as usual, continuing the theme from the first film.I also liked the villain a lot, the peacock Shen, voiced by the great Gary Oldman. The character is fleshed out more than your usual 2D villain, and he was pretty bad ass. Jack Black continues to prove that he's a great voice actor and provides the charm of the film with the lovable Po. His relationship with Angelina Jolie's Tigress is explored further in here as well, and it'll be interesting to see where they'll end up in the next sequel. I also liked the addition of Michelle Yeoh, who's pretty much great in everything she's in.The wicked fast pace doesn't ruin the film, but slowing it down could have made it better. While not an amazing sequel, KUNG FU PANDA 2 is still better than the first film. With a great visual sense of wonder, funny jokes, and fantastic action sequences, this is an entertaining and emotionally involving sequel that branches out the story from the first film. In 2D or 3D, do yourself a favor and just go watch it. 7.5/10",8,0,3,31 May 2011
American Psycho," Unrated Cut Review
","Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated and intelligent. He is twenty-seven and living his own American dream. He works by day on Wall Street, earning a fortune to complement the one he was born with. At night he descends into madness, as he experiments with fear and violence.I was really in a 'not wanting to watch this movie' mood, before watching this movie. I really was worried because I didn't know what to expect. Will it be really bloody and has a lot of violence? Well, surprisingly, the film is more or a dark comedy than a horror.The kills were not squeamish. Yeah, they were kind of violent, but not in a crude way. They were played like a satire so you really do not feel mad or disgusted by any content of this movie (expect maybe for some random sex scenes).What I didn't like about this film was the uneven pacing. Sometimes the movie passes really fast and sometimes it halts for a slow scene. It wasn't a huge deal, though. Christian Bale's performance is really different from what I've seen from other films of his. It may be in a good or bad way. I don't know. It was just plain weird.I'm a bit iffy with this film. It was decent and sometimes just plain horror fun. It wasn't anything spectacular and the pacing was uneven. Still, I'm going to recommend this film just for having a good sense of humor.",8,0,1,18 August 2007
Knowing," Knowing is Everything...
","It's hard to give a synopsis without giving too much way, so I'll try my best: John Koestler's son has just gotten the most chilling drawing from a time capsule. It contains numbers that predict deadly events that have occurred and that will occur.Brief, yes, but the less you know, the better. This is probably why the marketing of the film consists of short, mysterious scenes filled with jaw-dropping special effects yet very little on the actual plot. However, the critical reaction may make one think the mystery shrouding this film may not be good. I'll tell you now: Go watch the film if you're interested/intrigued.I'm afraid the critics are wrong on this one, and painfully so. The plot is far-fetched and probably (or hopefully) not realistic but this is why movies are made, isn't it? Escapism, one says. You sit down for two hours to escape from the real world to watch something fascinating, suspenseful, and, sometimes, disturbing, yet you know it can't be true but you go along with it anyway. This is 'Knowing,' a film that holds one's attention until the very end, bringing him or her into a world filled with some jaw dropping action scenes, with some very disturbing scenes with it.'Knowing' is different from your mindless popcorn thrillers because it isn't mindless. It's sometimes thought provoking and triggers a variety of emotions from the viewer. The film is funny when it needs to be, after having watch a very disturbing scene. The action scenes are amazing, some cringe-worthy, in a good way, actually, because it's not just 'Wow. Cool special effects,' although there really are some top notch effects, but because they are very hard to watch. The film really pushes the PG-13 rating and sometimes pushes it so far and shot so well that I was left speechless.The film also has a lot of fantastic performances, one from Nicolas Cage, an iffy actor, if you ask me but he manages to pull it off here. Chandler Canterbury, the kid actor one hopes to act well alongside Cage, also does a decent job. Rose Byrne finishes off the main cast with an equally well played role. And the movie isn't just about the action either. In some very human scenes, it may strike an emotional cord from some viewers.This is not your usual apocalyptic flick. No it isn't. It has something more, something I cannot reveal without spoiling the movie, including an out-of-the-world ending that will leave some viewers talking. Alex Proyas, again, does not disappoint. There are some fantastic performances and some ingenious action scenes, especially in the way they are shot, along with a very intriguing plot. This, I'm proud to say, is the best film this year, so far, and one of the most surprising films I've ever seen. If you're very interested in the film, give it a watch or you'll regret 'knowing' nothing about it.",9,87,164,20 March 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Better than The Terminator
","On the verge of Judgement Day, the most advanced Terminator unit ever, the T-X, arrives from the future to ensure the rise of the machines. The only hope against it is a new upgraded T-800 unit, the T-850, that is sent back by the human resistance. Together with John Connor, it must stop the rise of the machines or all humanity will fall.Like i've said in my past reviews, I never appreciated the concept of people going back in time to do all these things so this will happen in the future as much as other people did. However, the second movie decided to top it off. Nw the reason to watch this movie is to find out why is there still a Judgement Day and what happened to John Connor's mother.Well, they decided to take the easy and risk-free way out of it, turning this into a big, fun, and loud action film. Well, it's worth it. Although it doesn't put the mind into the plot, it certainly is (ironically) a better movie than the first.Now you guys might go crazy because I said this. I just like it a lot more than the first film, although not as good as the second. The action scenes are tons better than the first two films and the CGI really done well. The plot is still the same as ever and the dialog is campy and fun.So the general word in this film is 'fun'. Don't take it too seriously. It has a lot of humor and equal drama. The action sequences are fantastic and has one of the best car chase sequences I've ever seen. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a bigger and better role in here and Kristanna Loken, playing the new Terminatrix, has a perfect performance. Her role on the Terminator is great! It's just that good! The other two (Nick Stahl and Claire Danes) were also good.The score, although not the same as the first two, is good. The direction by Jonathan Mostow is good, although this sequel is unnecessary.If you would just like to have a good fun time on a popcorn movie, this is the film for you. It's, not only a worthy sequel, it's a great film.",7,0,1,23 April 2006
The Orphanage," A tale of love. A story of horror.
","The story concerns Laura, who has returned with her husband Carlos and adopted child Simon to the large manor where she was raised in an orphanage as a child. Laura is determined to fix up the abandoned house and open it as a refuge for ill children. But from the moment she returns, the past begins to haunt her. It isn't long before she begins to see the children who she used to play with as a seven-year-old. And when Simon goes missing one afternoon, she's convinced that they have taken him hostage.THE ORPHANAGE is a refreshing horror movie. This is due to the fact that the film doesn't rely on scary CGI images nor cheap scare tactics. On top of that, little, little (little) blood is spilled in this chilling ghost story. On the contrary, the film relies on its characters, the atmosphere, the setting, and (let's not forget) a satisfying plot.What makes the film work is of the performance by the lead, Belén Rueda, who does such a great job playing the whole 'what's real/what isn't' act. I believe this is Juan Antonio Bayona's directorial debut and he does a fantastic job. I'm looking forward to see more of his movies in the future. Also, I would like to add that the score was great as well as the beautiful cinematography.By the end, when the truth is revealed, it's satisfying but it has been done before in other films. It's a different ghost story and I have to stress the 'different.' It doesn't have the usual 'Boo!' scares or ghosts in creepy make-up. The film allows the characters to develop so we care for them and a creepy atmosphere in a great setting. THE ORPHANAGE is a refreshing horror movie that is pretty unconventional.",7,0,1,7 August 2009
"I, Robot"," The Three Laws Safe
","Set in a future Earth (2035 A.D.) where robots are common assistants and workers for their human owners, this is the story of 'robotophobic' Chicago Police Detective Del Spooner's investigation into the murder of Dr. Alfred Lanning, who works at U.S. Robotics, in which a robot, Sonny, appears to be implicated, even though that would mean the robot had violated the Three Laws of Robotics, which is apparently impossible. It seems impossible because.. if robots can break those laws, there's nothing to stop them from taking over the world, as humans have grown to become completely dependent upon their robots. Or maybe...they already have? Aiding Spooner in his investigation is a psychologist, Dr. Susan Calvin, who specializes in the psyches of robots.This is one of your smarter blockbuster released in 2004. It's not all about the action and I'm glad that it's more of an adultish thriller than a mindless popcorn film we've seen all the time. The script is great as well with the overall story.This movie makes you think and nothing is ever spoon fed to you. I like the overall look of the film, including the zooney effects on the camera-work in the third act. But I also think this movie could've used more imagination like other futuristic film.I like the acting by Will Smith and the great Alan Tudyk. Most of the comic relief goes to Bridget Moynahan, although ironically acting serious. The action sequences in most of the film aren't that great. They don't give off much suspenseful (with an exceptional third act).One of the few surprises for a blockbuster film, I, Robot is a smart and intelligent thriller with a great story and less on the action. Do you want to see something different? Watch this.",7,0,0,26 June 2007

Wanted," Choose Your Destiny
","A young man finds out his long lost father is an assassin. And when his father is murdered, the son is recruited into his father's old organization and trained by a man named Sloan to follow in his dad's footsteps.Anyone who knows me knows that I love CGI-filled movies, especially 'Speed Racer,' '300,' 'The Matrix,' 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,' and the likes. I tend to like CGI-filled movies more if they actually focus on the plot and this is that kind of movie. Yes, what you get here are some of the best action sequences you'll ever see in the big screen along with a decent plot with some nice and sometimes predictable twists and turns.This is no doubt one of the movies to see this summer! What I liked about this film was that it keeps you entertained from beginning to end, even though it's a big smash and bash kind of action movie. You think you would have seen every action scene you had ever seen, especially after the mildly entertaining and mostly boring action scenes from 'The Incredible Hulk.' Well, you're wrong.The style and action in here is so like 'The Matrix,' which has never been done before outside the Matrix trilogy, that the movie is actually adds a fresh and original quality to action films, if possible. The performances in here are fantastic, especially hearing dialog you had never heard from Morgan Freeman. James McAvoy and Angelina Jolie both have a lot of fun in this movie, as well as the other cast.If you come in here to see a realistic action film, you might as well watch a documentary. This film is so over-the-top, ridiculous, but also a lot of fun! It's one of the funnest and entertaining time I've ever had in the cinema! The style and action is top notch, the performances are great, and the plot decent. What else do you want more from a big blockbuster released over the summer?!",7,2,8,28 June 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Extended Cut Review
","Nearly 10 years have passed since Sarah Connor was targeted for termination by a cyborg from the future. Now her son, John, the future leader of the resistance, is the target for a newer, more deadly terminator. Once again, the resistance has managed to send a protector back to attempt to save John and his mother Sarah.Okay, we understand. A Terminator sent back to kill the lead of a resistance. Blah, blah, blah. Although thought provoking, I never thought The Terminator was a masterpiece. I thought the third was better. The order I've seen the films is weird: Third, first, and second. This movie (the second) is the best (yet) and I'm glad to say I won't be using the word 'mediocre' in this review.The second movie uses the plot but delves in deeper, making it really interesting and clever. It's more than what the plot is about. I liked the score of the film. I also liked the CGI and action sequences. Well, too much action than I thought. The first hour and thirty minutes are slow, in my opinion. Once it picks up, the film gets much better from there.Although not Oscar worthy, Arnold Schwarzenegger's role is perfect for him. Robert Patrick, playing the villain, gives us a scary role. I know people won't like me saying this but Linda Hamilton is quite annoying with her more mature role. I missed the sweet and innocent performance from the first film. Well, you can't stay nice and sweet when robots are trying to kill your son, can you? Edward Furlong's performance is also good.I found this film smarter and more clever than the first film. It's the best of the series and one of the best science fiction films ever made. It's not a dumb, big blockbuster with action and special effects. It has the compelling story and the great script. A worthy collection to James Cameron's collection, watch this now.",9,2,2,2 July 2007
Salt," Who is Salt?
","As a CIA officer, Evelyn Salt swore an oath to duty, honor and country. Her loyalty will be tested when a defector accuses her of being a Russian spy. Salt goes on the run, using all her skills and years of experience as a covert operative to elude capture. Salt's efforts to prove her innocence only serve to cast doubt on her motives, as the hunt to uncover the truth behind her identity continues and the question remains: 'Who Is Salt?' (Columbia Pictures)SALT is preposterous, absurd, and unbelievable. The filmmakers know this very well. Yet, it's an extremely well made action flick. Unlike INCEPTION, SALT never tries to be groundbreaking cinema. It's never too ambition and wrapped in its own world. It never tries to be anything more than what it really is: A highly enjoyable action film. AKA: The perfect summer movie. Because of this, SALT succeeds in almost every level.Star Angelina Jolie actually brings the film on another level. She's just very impressive in her role, bringing an emotional depth for her character and doing the terrific stunt works throughout the film. She does it all here, leaping from the tops of vehicles driving at high speed on the highway, making an exploding device with a fire extinguisher and some household chemicals, and running with no shoes on from one place to another, just to name a few. She's clearly THE female action hero. Liev Schreiber doesn't seem to have much to do but he's as good as always. I also liked seeing Chiwetel Ejiofor in more films because he's a unique actor.The film is also filled with many chase scenes that are done really well that is sure to pump up your adrenaline. The action sequences are surprisingly inventive and ingenious as well, the soundtrack by the brilliant James Newton Howard accompanying it with skill and playfulness. Let's not forget the light use of CGI and camera shakiness, making the experience a whole lot better than it already is.Overall, SALT shows us that Angelina Jolie is still the great action star that she always was and that action flicks can still be well made. While it won't change the world, it's a very entertaining summer action film that is sure to result in the same reaction the condiment of the very same name produced.",7,24,46,30 July 2010
Disturbia," Every Killer Lives Next Door
","After his father's death, Kale Brecht becomes sullen, withdrawn, and troubled -- so much so that he finds himself under a court-ordered sentence of house arrest. He becomes a voyeur as his interests turn outside the windows of his suburban home towards those of his neighbors, one of which Kale begins to suspect is a serial killer.After coming back from the movie, I was happy. Although it could've been better, I still liked the film for being clever and humorous. Carl Ellsworth wrote this film, who also wrote Red Eye. I would have to say that Red Eye was slightly better.Shia LaBeouf's acting is very good in the film. He's realistic playing the techno-savvy teenager who falls in love with the sexy Ashley, played by Sarah Roemer. Carrie-Anne Moss also gives a good performance playing the naive mother and Aaron Yoo as the comedic friend, providing the laughs for the film. I also like to say David Morse's acting was very creepy. He plays a realistic sinister man in the neighborhood.Some people might go in here, getting restless for the film beginning too slow. I didn't mind that the real action happened close to the last half hour of the film. The first hour of the film gives a set up as the teen being a voyeur which makes you feel for the character and makes the film much more thrilling rather than beginning the action right away.This film is very well done, great score and cinematography, and has its own suspenseful and thrilling scenes. If you want a thriller, mixed with romance and comedy, watch Disturbia but don't get restless for the first hour of the film.",7,1,6,15 April 2007
Van Helsing," 'You Can Only Kill it with the Silver Bullet!'
","--I love that line from the movie, said by Kate Beckinsale. Now back to the point: This movie is about a notorious monster hunter, Van Helsing, who is sent to Transylvania to protect the two siblings Anna and Velkan Valerious before Count Dracula kills them before they do. Why? If Count Dracula kills the both of them before they do, they will condemn the whole family to eternal damnation. Van Helsing is also sent there to stop Count Dracula who is using Dr. Frankenstein's research and a werewolf to make his and his wives children born.I wouldn't call this a CGI overload. I would call this a piece of entertainment! This is a great popcorn film with many great special effects with great action sequences! The movie is entertaining to the beginning through the end, although it's over two hours long. This movie takes all of the old monster movies into one whole movie. I would compare this movie to The Brothers Grimm, which takes all of the fairy tales into one movie.The beginning of the film might be off to a great start like any other Frakenstein movie when the famous line is called out: 'It's Alive!' The beginning is black and white, like the old movies, for about 7 minutes and it's over from there. As you can see, the monsters being featured in this film are the Wolfman, Frakenstein, and Dracula and maybe including some other tid bits. The way a human who turns into a wolf is unique. The human actually tears its own skin off revealing fur and it does the same thin when they turn back into a human.One problem in the movie is that this movie is too long. It's over two hours long but I still enjoyed it like any other popcorn movie. This is a great action adventure that will be great for all ages and I highly recommend this film. This film will make you feel like a kid again! Actually, this is my first film comment that is this long!",6,0,1,19 June 2006
Monsters vs. Aliens," Oooze gonna save us?
","When a radioactive meteor hurtles into Susan Murphy on her wedding day, she is transformed into a towering, platinum-haired giant. Taken away by the government, Susan is introduced to other scientific oddities, including the amphibious Missing Link , the dim blob B.O.B., and the brilliant, bug-headed Dr. Cockroach. These 'monsters' are released from captivity when a massive alien robot sent by the scheming Gallaxhar appears in San Francisco. With little time to adjust to her new stature, Susan must learn to work with her strange allies to avoid an all-out extraterrestrial invasion.MVA is what I would call a 'safe' movie. It's fluffy and nice, but it doesn't push boundaries. It sticks to entertaining the audience for 90 or so minutes and it does the job well. Compared to Pixar's most recent movie, UP, it's pretty much crap, but I won't do that because most animated movies can't reach Pixar's greatness.MVA starts off pretty quickly and the movie runs in a fast pace. I'll admit it, some of the jokes are plain dumb and unfunny. There's one scene where the president of the US plays a well-known tune when first meeting an alien spaceship. It was cringe-worthy to say the least. However, the movie also has a lot of funny moments, most coming from Seth Rogen's character, B.O.B. He's my favorite character in the movie. The other actors were decent, but nothing to shout about.The movie also has plenty of great spectacles and some truly vibrant action sequences. I did not see this movie in 3D, but this is one of the few rare movies where watching it in 3D could possibly make it a BETTER movie. As I watched through the movie, I envied the fact that I was watching it in 2D, seeing some obvious shots for the 3D technology when it was in theaters a few months back. But overall, it's a fast-paced, forgettable, harmless movie for the family to enjoy.",6,0,0,5 December 2009
Step Up 2: The Streets," It's not where you're from. It's where you're at.
","A rebellious street dancer named Andie, part of Baltimore's most intimidating dance crew, the 410, who is given a chance to attend the prestigious Maryland School of the Arts. She finds it difficult to fit into her new school life while keeping her friends from the 410. Determined to prove her skills, she assembles an eclectic crew of classmates that includes Chase, the schools best dancer, to compete against the 410 in the premier underground dance battle in Baltimore, The Streets.I quite enjoyed Step Up, although the plot was clichéd and predictable, but the dance moves were good. Now picture that, times TEN! Anyone crazy enough to see this movie for the plot should not see this film. Why would anyone see this movie? The dance moves.There are double the dancing sequences and double the greatness! I was won over by it. The charming two leads and the lovable characters add as the cherry on top. The plot? There's nothing there. Been there. Done that. However, if you set your expectations right, you'll be surprised to turn out that you like this movie.Obviously, if you're an older person, you may not like this movie as much as if you're a teen. Of course, the demographics for this movie is to attract teens. All in all, this is about a notch or two better than the original, but plotwise, it's the same. Watch this movie for the dances. Not the plot. Otherwise, the piece is entertaining.",7,42,58,20 February 2008
Being John Malkovich," It's Surprising, Thought Provoking, and Original!
","Craig, a puppeteer, takes a filing job in a low-ceilinged office in Manhattan. Although married to the slightly askew Lotte, he hits on a colleague, the sexually frank Maxine. She's bored but snaps awake when he finds a portal leading inside John Malkovich: for 15 minutes you see, hear, and feel whatever JM is doing, then you fall out by the New Jersey Turnpike.This movie is filled with originality. What the movie gives you is thought provoking and in the middle of the movie, it makes a surprising turn, offering us more twists. Yeah, this won't be a mainstream film, but really, people, go see it! Watch something different from Charlie Kaufman's twisted mind!I liked the acting by John Cusack and Catherine Keener but Cameron Diaz a lot more because she acts really different and unrecognizable from the naked eye. In one point of the movie, I like to praise for its cinematography where we could feast our eyes on.This movie is interesting and sometimes really funny. It's offers something different for the silver screen and it's really original. This is one of the best films ever made!",8,1,2,4 June 2007
Face_Off," In order to catch him, he must become him.
","FBI Special Agent Sean Archer tries to find a biological weapon placed in Los Angeles by a sadistic terrorist-for-hire and criminal mastermind named Castor Troy. Archer has hunted Troy for the last 8 years, and is consumed by revenge because Troy is responsible for the death of Archer's son. To do this, Archer must 'borrow' Troy's face using a surgical procedure to go undercover as Troy, but things go wrong when Troy assumes the identity of Archer.Having already seen other John Woo's film than 'Face/Off,' I was expecting a big, popcorn blockbuster to forget about at the end of the credits. Well, I was wrong. In fact, this movie surprised me. In fact, this is John Woo's best film to date.This film surprised me by how shocking it is. Some of the things that happen in this movie is indescribable. Other things that happen in this movie never even happened in any other action movies I've ever seen. The ideas used in this film is ingenious. What I would add to that is that this is one of the most emotionally-charged action film I've ever seen in my life.And no, this is no joke. This film is depressing from the scene in the beginning. It gets even more depressing and even more depressing. How does it end? Of course, I won't tell you. You'll have to see it for yourself. The action scenes, for all the love I have for them, are just too much in here. It's pretty much overkill during the last scenes in this film.However, it's not sad to say the action scenes in here are fantastic. Now going to the performances: Have you ever seen a film where two characters switch each other's places and have them act as their other character, yet you don't believe the authenticity in there? Well, in this film, John Travolta and Nicolas Cage won me over. They played their other characters so well, that you find yourself thinking if they're really the other character. I know, it gets confusing. But this is an accomplishment.'Face/Off' isn't just a popcorn, summer, action flick. It's a darn good one. The characters are diverse. The plot may seem silly but it works. The action is huge. This film is a perfect package for one of the 'better' action films out there and the best film John Woo has made to date.",7,1,1,31 March 2008
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Summer Movie Done Right
","The Mission: Impossible franchise is a lot like the Fast and Furious, in that the later sequels are better and more entertaining than the early installments. MI3 is my personal favorite in the series, which I think is vastly underrated and pretty much the quintessential action movie. Ghost Protocol, while not as amazing, was still pretty great, with Brad Bird bringing his own charm and sensibilities to the franchise. Rogue Nation continues this trend with some of the best set pieces in the entire series. You'll be glad to know the plane heist, which has been promoted to death in the trailers and poster, is actually the first scene in the film, proving director Christopher McQuarrie has more up his sleeve. And that he does. I don't want to spoil them, but the action scenes are so creative and executed extremely well, you'd be fascinated to wonder what went on in the head of McQuarrie when he had to come up with them.For example, there's a stunning set piece in an opera house, which brings to mind the climax of Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) in the best possible way. In the sequence, McQuarrie has to juggle a lot of variables, but he pulls it off masterfully. And in my favorite action scene, there's an underwater set piece that could have been taken directly from Gravity. By the time the film has reached its ending, you can't help but feel exhausted. If there's one thing to complain about of the film, it's that it succumbs to the pitfall of being too long. The film didn't really need to be 131 minutes, and part of that has to do with the overlong and slightly disappointing third act. The plot is also a little convoluted for its own good, with a few too many reveals and reversals.Nevertheless, the ever reliable Tom Cruise brings his A game, reminding audiences why we loved him in the first place. He's the heart and soul of the Mission: Impossible franchise, and fortunately, he hasn't lost his luster yet. Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, and Ving Rhames return for this installment, but apart from Pegg, Renner and Rhames are mostly in the background. Rhames, in particular, is resorted to saying witty one-liners, and that's about it. However, it's Rebecca Ferguson who shines. This is the first thing I've seen her in, and she's right there alongside Cruise the whole way through. Sean Harris is unrecognizable as the film's villain and he gives a good performance, but like most of the villains in the series, he merely gets the job done. Regardless of its shortcomings, Rogue Nation is consistently good with the rest of the franchise, only ranking behind parts 3 and 4 for me. It's an enormously entertaining summer flick that contains some of the best action scenes the year has to offer so far.",8,6,12,31 July 2015
She's the Man," Likable and Hilarious!
","When Viola learns her soccer team is no more, she wants to join the boys team. The coach says no, so she dresses up like her brother Sebastian, and goes to his school for two weeks and pretends to be him. Her roommate Duke also plays soccer, and has a serious crush on a girl named Olivia. Olivia likes Sebastien, who is really Viola who really likes Duke. When Sebastian comes home, everything gets complicated!There were 'The Hot Chick', 'Big Momma's House', 'White Chicks', 'Freaky Friday', and a few more of those similar movies which were, I guess, a success in the box office. This film is like the others but why wasn't this as successful as the films I've just mentioned? I was kind of disappointed that not as many people watched this film but I guess that's the way it is.This straight out hilarious. I mean it. It's a very highly entertaining film with laugh out loud jokes and satirical humor. I guess it accomplishes the goal of being a comedy. Now for the plot, who cares if it's ludicrous? I mean, I bet people didn't mind anything from the movies I've mentioned earlier.Amanda Bynes is so cute that puts a smile to your face. Yeah, she can't act like a guy? So what? She delivers the laughs and so do many other people in the ensemble cast. You also can't help but admit the plot is confusing. If you've read the plot line of this movie, you'll find out why.This is as funny (and sometimes surprisingly serious) as many of the films I've mentioned above. The song choices, appropriately picked, are great for the teens who is watching his film. Sure, it's not groundbreaking from this kind of plot but it sure is a hell lot of fun, fast paced, hilarious comedy. This one sure hits it out of the ballpark!",6,1,1,15 August 2007
Spider-Man," It's A Bird, It's a Plane, It's-- Spider-Man?
","Based on Marvel Comics' superhero character, this is a story of Peter Parker who is a nerdy high-schooler. He was orphaned as a child, bullied by jocks, and can't confess his crush for his stunning neighborhood girl Mary Jane Watson. One day while on an excursion to a laboratory a runaway radioactive spider bites him... and his life changes in a way no one could have imagined.Peter acquires powers a spider has... but the fun isn't going to last. An eccentric millionaire Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and his maniacal alter ego Green Goblin emerges. Now Peter Parker has to become Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else Goblin will kill him. They come face to face and the war begins in which only one of them will survive at the end.I don't know why I didn't like this film as much as everybody did. I think it lacked something. No, I liked the character's origins. No, not the action, since they were great with breathtaking special effects. Maybe they could have done more with the action or more with the villain (although I didn't like the Green Goblin as a villain).Everything good in the film isn't great, comparing to great superhero films like its sequel, Spider-Man 2 and 3, Daredevil, or Hellboy. I liked the action sequences in the film, and I liked the humor from some scenes.Tobey Maguire playing Spider-Man was relatively good, as well as Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst. The score was good, as well as the cinematography. Maybe I was expecting more than they showed in the movie. This film was good, but it wasn't anything great. It fell short with my expectations. I didn't like the ending. Just expect what you want.",7,0,1,1 June 2007
Shrek Forever After," A Surprisingly Dark Finale for the Franchise
","Shrek is feeling over-domesticated in the fourth installment. He has lost his roar. It used to send villagers running away in terror. Now they run to him and ask him to sign their pitchforks and torches. To regain his ogre mojo, he strikes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin. The pact goes awry and Shrek must confront what life would be like in Far Far Away if he had never existed. That translates into Donkey being forced into cart-pulling duty, fat and lazy Puss in Boots trading his sword for a pink bow and the underhanded Rumpelstiltskin ruling the kingdom.It's official: Dreamworks has crap marketing when promoting their movies. As some of you might have noticed, the marketing for the final chapter of Shrek seemed lukewarm and tepid, to say the least. Fortunately, the film is anything but that. In fact, I have to say that SHREK 4 is a surprisingly dark finale for the franchise. SHREK 4 plays out like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE with Shrek being the protagonist. The main reason this film succeeds is because there is a strong story to be told, unlike part 3. The story plays out as straightforward as it could be, which works really well. There are no twists and turns and unnecessary subplots. This way, we feel more connected with Shrek and his goal.The heart, which was lacking in the last film, is back in here, which is more of a welcome. There are a lot of depressing and serious moments in here as well as some very moving scenes that will make some people cry. However, all is not somber. There are plenty of hilarious moments in here too, most of which are coming from Donkey and Puss in Boots, as well as some new ogre characters. Other new characters include Rumpelstiltskin, a fantastic and devilish villain, and the ingenious use of Pied Piper.I would also like to point out the fantastic soundtrack by Harry Gregson-Williams. He incorporates the previous themes in the series and made them much more personal and heartfelt than ever before. The use of the 3D is also put to good use, rather than have things pop out for every five minutes. Maybe the only complaint I had is that the climax battle is a bit weak, much like IRON MAN 2. While not as great as the first two, I much prefer this film to be the ending to the series than the disappointing third film. With a strong story, great characters, and a good moral, SHREK 4 may as well be the first great film of the summer.",8,3,9,23 May 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Something Wicked This Way Comes!
","Harry Potter is having a tough time with his relatives (yet again). He runs away after using magic to blow Uncle Vernon's sister Marge who was being offensive towards Harry's parents. Initially scared for using magic outside the school, he is pleasantly surprised that he won't be penalized after all. However, he soon learns that a dangerous criminal and Voldemort's trusted aide Sirius Black has escaped from the Azkaban prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile shape-shifters called Dementors are appointed to guard the school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him. Little does Harry know that by the end of this year, many holes in his past (whatever he knows of it) will be filled up and he will have a clearer vision of what the future has in store.This film is darker and much better than the previous two films. I loved the new vision of the Harry Potter world by Alfonso Cuarón (obviously, each director has a different perspective). I found this perspective much more dangerous and less for little children, per se. The comedy is still here, though.This film or the fourth Harry Potter film is probably the best film to date! I love the new score (although missing the old one) but this one gives us a bit darker atmosphere and magical at the same time. I love the new style of the film, giving it a more 'laid back' look than the uniforms look.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson matured more into their roles, which makes their performances better. The new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, plays a much younger and stronger look of this character.The visual effects are also good and there are much more sophisticated story telling in here, which I like. There are even more darker action sequences which contains more thrills and suspense. I like Alfonso Cuarón as a director and this is one of his finest work.No more kidding around. This movie is much better and darker then the previous two movies. The performances are a bit better and the story a bit more sophisticated with great CGI and script. It's not all about the action. It's more about the story.",8,0,1,29 June 2007
Ratatouille," A Splendid Meal
","Remy is a rat, constantly risking life in an expensive French restaurant because of his love of good food, as well as a desire to become a chef. Yet, obviously, this is a rather tough dream for a rat. But opportunity knocks when a young boy, who desperately needs to keep his job at the restaurant, despite his lack of cooking abilities, discovers and partners the young Remy. Its up to the two of them to avoid the insane head chef, bring the rest of Remy's family up to his standards, win his partner a girl, and, of course, produce the finest Ratatouille in all of France.Last year's Pixar movie, 'Cars', was really underwhelming, although still generic. This put Pixar back on its tracks. Not just with the seamless, not to mention wonderful, animation, imagination, but with the unique storyline.Every speck of scene is done with great detail (of course with a budget of $150 million!). The vivid colors and all turns this into a visual masterpiece! Yet, the movie (for a whole) wasn't perfect. It fell just beneath my expectations.Maybe I expected more than the unusual. Although with a weird plot, it didn't go anywhere in the movie until the last twenty minutes in the film, not to mention some choppy pacing. Also, this movie is more for adults and teens than for kids, probably why it didn't make as much money than most Pixar films.Still, in the end, Ratatouille is a fantastic animated feature, worthy in the Pixar franchise. It's funny and it's a visual delight. Although it doesn't make a perfect meal, it's still fantastic to eat.",7,1,3,12 November 2007
Aliens," This Time It's War
","The only survivor of the Nostromo, Ripley is discovered in deep sleep half a century later by a salvage ship. When she is taken back to Earth, she learns that a human colony was founded on the same planet where the aliens were first found. After contact with the colony is lost, she finds herself sent back to the planet along with a team of warriors bent on destroying the alien menace forever, and saving any survivors -- if any remain.I was really looking forward to this film because all I heard about this film from people who have seen it called it 'intense' and some even said it was better than the first Alien film. Well, after seeing this film, I probably set my expectations too high. One thing you learn in the Alien franchise is that you can't expect the end to be the end.Although I mistakingly confusing the ending of this film from the first film, I still knew the ending to this film. The clichés are still there, although it wouldn't be called clichés when I would've seen this film in 1986. The film is still predictable, although not as predictable as the first film.Intensity? There weren't any intense scenes, unlike the first film. Maybe it was just me. Maybe some people are thrilled in one thing while others are thrilled in others. I might be in the minority of this film saying this film isn't a masterpiece. Sure, there are some jaw dropping moments but the film didn't manage to prolong the intensity.What I also didn't like about the film was that it didn't capture my attention. For the first full hour, literally nothing happens, not that it's bad or anything. I was just bored. On the upside, the effects are much better and the make up effects were also very good. Sigourney Weaver is as tough as always and there are some stupid people in the group.I suppose this film is as good as The Terminator, which I also didn't like as much as other people who called it a masterpiece. The time I've seen this film probably affected my opinion towards this movie. I've seen films that are much more intense than this. Still, I would say this is a decent sequel to this series.",9,0,3,24 August 2007

The FBI sends LAPD officer Brian O'Conner undercover into Los Angeles' street racing circuit to take down Toretto and his team. As O'Conner becomes part of Toretto's life and gets involved with his sister, Mia, he tries to prove that Toretto is innocent.TFaTF can be seen as a mindless popcorn flick. However, what puts TFaTF above mindless popcorn flicks is the fact that it has a brain which took me back by surprise. The film isn't only about street racing with hot lesbian girls and how much muscle your car has. There's actually a decent story in here! And this is the reason why I enjoyed the film.Another thing that stuck out to me was the rare use of CGI. The car sequences in the film are extremely well done, mostly due to using practical effects rather than CGI. The scenes felt more real and gritty compared to action scenes in other films. The climax car sequence had me on the edge of my seats!The performances by the cast members aren't half bad either. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker both pull off convincing roles. There's something about Diesel that is likable. I don't know what it is, though. I also liked Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez, who complete the clan. Overall, here's a mindless popcorn film that isn't at all that mindless and performances that aren't at all bad.",7,1,2,14 June 2010
Captain America: Civil War," No, 'Civil War' isn't the Best Marvel Movie Ever Made
","When early word had it that Captain America: Civil War was the best film Marvel's done to date, I should have known better. I guess having the privilege to see big blockbusters in advance does make one want to overpraise them into oblivion, even if it's something like Batman v Superman. But don't worry. Civil War is at least better than that, but it's certainly not the best Marvel film to date. Far from it.I have so many thoughts regarding this film that it would be too much to write out in a review, so I'll boil it down to this: Marvel will be Marvel, and that's what kept Civil War from being great. Like most of their films, Civil War follows a certain formula that we've come to expect from Marvel flicks, and it doesn't stray away from that path. Its unwillingness to take risks is ultimately disappointing but not all that surprising. While the trailers for Civil War promised something dark, serious, and challenging, where lives and relationships between the characters we love are at stake, the film is anything but. In fact, Civil War has a surprising amount of humor, so much so that it severely undercuts the tension and central conflict between Iron Man and Captain America. Why call it a CIVIL WAR when there are one-liners and quips spoken every minute? Since when were Falcon and Bucky buddy-buddy towards each other? Their scenes, among many others, felt like something out of a freaking sitcom. Despite the many flaws BvS suffered from, the film at least had a consistent tone and the climactic battle itself felt significant and crucial to a point where someone could die.That's the biggest weakness of this film. Everything felt so trivial and inconsequential. Calling it a Civil War is an overstatement when the war itself never amounts to anything more than a bunch of kids fighting together on a playground. There are no real casualties in this film, despite the fact that the film tries so very hard to convince you otherwise. 'You've caused so many civilian casualties!' our heroes are told, but just wait until the next scene when there are some jokes thrown in to lighten up the mood, because you know, talking about endangering lives and having security vs. freedom shouldn't be *too* serious a discussion. You can't have your cake and eat it too, Marvel, and that's exactly what Civil War wanted: to be sincere about the very real and relevant issues it's tackling but also make it fun and entertaining for the whole family to enjoy - because more $$$. Even during the climax when motivations and reveals come into play and you feel like someone could die, it ends in such a whimper that you feel what occurred won't have any meaningful effect in future films.And that's just it. Civil War is entertaining and watchable for what it is - and again, a whole lot better than BvS - but it could have been so much more.",6,11,22,12 May 2016
Saw III," Another October, Another Saw
","The plot is about people in traps made by Jigsaw and his assistant, Amanda, and they must get out of them to live. That's obvious but there are two victims. The first victim trapped under Jigsaw's game is the Dr. Lynn Denlon who must keep Jigsaw alive. If he dies, she dies. She must keep him alive as long as it takes this other victim, Jeff, to complete a game of his own, which is trying to find a way out of this house maze.Apart from the very bad Saw II, Saw III was a very good film. It's not a great one, not better than Saw, but a lot better than Saw II. Now, there are a little bit of characters, which leaves room for character development, unlike Saw II which had many characters probably just for the kills. There's a lot more gore and it makes the first two films look like Disney films. And there's the extreme again, where the second left off and in which Saw had.There are a lot of more traps in this film and they are very creative. This film also connects to the first two films very well so that's another good thing. In this film, we actually care for the villains (in my opinion). And in the end, you expected it, there's another twist. This is not the greatest twist of them all, probably the weakest but I didn't care. I didn't really get the ending because the ending feels a little bit rushed which was a problem.Some other problems, called cliffhangers, or left for a sequel, are unexplained sub plots. Not all things were explained in Saw III, but we all know it'll be in Saw IV, which there will be one apparently next October? This film is suspenseful and some parts are thrilling and there are scenes that wants to make you throw up or cover your eyes.This film is a great recovery from Saw II. It's not the best one in the trilogy but it's worth the $8 dollars in the theater or a buy on the DVD. This won't disappoint the Saw fans so go see it!",6,0,1,3 November 2006
Tropic Thunder," The movie they think they're making... isn't a movie anymore.
","Tropic Thunder is a 2008 action comedy film directed by Ben Stiller and starring Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr. as a group of prima donna actors filming a Vietnam War film when their fed-up writer-director decides to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out.What I expected from this movie was to have a good time laughing my ass off. Fortunately, it's funnier than most comedies I've seen in quite awhile. I didn't even find 'Superbad' as funny as people made it out to be. Maybe I don't laugh as much as normal people. Unfortunately, the film didn't exceed my expectations. I expected more laughs but what can you expect? I'm just a non-laughable person.But who cares if I didn't laugh as much as I expected to. I actually laughed, which must count for an accomplishment the film did. The beginning of the film starts off with faux trailers, like the ones shown during 'Grindhouse,' so don't worry if you're not seeing the movie, even though you are seeing it. It just gives you what movies the protagonists are in.Most of the laughs are close to the beginning and end and a little in the middle. The movie works as an action movie and a comedy, each actor seeming to have a fun time in their roles. I also like the fact that this movie has a lot of cameos (and when I say a lot, there is a lot) but I won't surprise you, even though there is one apparent name that is sticking out to you already.Well, if you don't already know, I won't say it but if you do, you must know that after people see this movie, people would start to respect him as an actor, even though I never lost respect for this man. People will start to see him as a cool man. Like Morgan Freeman in 'Wanted,' you'll hear and see things that this man has never done before and it's quite funny because his performance is so over-the-top.It's not only him that may be the highlight of the movie, so the other is obviously Robert Downey Jr. How is he? He's very good and funny but all of you should know that by now. Everyone else in the movie also give off a few laughs, although the first two actors I've mentioned are probably the most memorable.With some decent action scenes and very funny scenes, 'Tropic Thunder' is the comedy to see this summer. One of the reason might be because of the cameos and over-the-top performances in here. Another is that this film actually made me laugh, which is an incredible feat for comedies to accomplish this year. For those reasons, I think it's a worthy admission to see it in theaters.",7,2,7,15 August 2008
Enchanted," Amy Adams is Enchanting!
","A classic Disney fairytale collides with modern-day New York City in a story about a fairytale princess from the past who is thrust into present-day by an evil queen. Soon after her arrival, Princess Giselle begins to change her views on life and love after meeting a handsome lawyer. Can a storybook view of romance survive in the real world?I was quite embarrassed to see myself in a crowd of mothers and children while watching the film. Still, I wouldn't mind since I knew this was going to be a good movie. Was I right? Yes but it did fell below my expectations. The whole concept felt like another film released this year. It was called 'Happily N'ever After' and that had a much better sense of humor because there were some jokes the adults could enjoy.The jokes in this film were pretty basic and childish and maybe a few that were laugh-out-loud. But this film in't about the comedy, right? Well, for the most part, this is a very cute, entertaining, although sometimes dragging a bit, and for the whole family to enjoy.Yes, the movie is predictable but the main reason why this movie worked, and I know people would agree, is because of Amy Adams! If another actress would take her spot, it wouldn't have been much successful as it is right now. She is just magical in her role, which was really good. James Marsden, Susan Sarandon, and Patrick Dempsey all played their role really well too.The songs in here are a bit cheesy and overly cute, although it wasn't anything special. The special effects in the end were, I thought, was just unnecessary. Overall, it's good family entertainment for November and December but it's not a classic. It's just a worthwhile trip that people may forget until next year.",7,3,4,1 December 2007
The Usual Suspects," Yeah, I Know, Surprising, Isn't It?
","Following a truck hijack in New York, five conman are arrested and brought together for questioning. As none of them is guilty, they plan a revenge operation against the police. The operation goes well, but then the influence of a legendary mastermind criminal called Kaiser Soeze is felt. It becomes clear that each one of them has wronged Soeze at some point and must pay back now. The payback job leaves 27 men dead in a boat explosion, but the real question arises now: Who actually is Kaiser Soeze?Please, before anyone attack me, let me say everyone has a right to express their opinion, even though they don't agree with you. I'll explain why I hated this movie and why it was so bad, unlike many other millions of people who loved this movie.Okay, starting with one huge complaint: The movie is not interesting, but more confusing. I know you all must think it's stupid to hate this movie because I didn't get it at all but when I read it in Wikipedia, where it explains everything so I can understand, I still didn't like the movie, so there you go.I thought I might've been a stupid moviegoer to not understand but Wikipedia explains the plot points in a straight-forward telling. It doesn't go into all this confusing scenes like the movie did. I was confused and didn't care what happened in the movie.Yes, I've seen 'Scary Movie' before this movie. Why? Because that movie spoofs this movie's twist ending (I don't know how I got that information without even watching The Usual Suspect, but I knew for some reason. I forgot) so I thought the twist ending was obvious and very stupid.Some good things about the film was the greatly written score and some good performances. Now, back to the subject. Is the movie good? No. Should you watch it? The only reason you should watch it is because of the surprise ending, if you haven't seen 'Scary Movie', yet. If you have, don't spend your time watching this.",6,3,8,16 September 2007
Inside Out," Let Your Emotions Run
","INSIDE OUT is the best film by Pixar since TOY STORY 3. However, the film never really reaches the amazing quality Pixar is known for. It's perfectly good though, and there are moments of Pixar brilliance: The beginning and ending are especially fantastic. The setup of the world inside Riley's mind is wonderful, original, and clever, while the ending is appropriately emotional, delivering a surprising payoff that will make anyone cry. Well, anyone with emotion.Unfortunately, the middle is where it drags. The problem is the second act of the film is very repetitive and predictable, with little differentiation between scenes that could sustain interest. Once you see the tracks being laid out, you can tell where everything is heading, which isn't a huge problem, but it definitely made me impatient during certain moments in the film. I know I'm in the minority when I say this, but I'm also not a huge fan of imaginary character (Bing Bong, oh god). I found his character to be very grating, who felt more like a plot device than an actual, fully-realized character.Despite all that, and this is where I let my walls down, the whole is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. INSIDE OUT is an important film, where the filmmakers found a ingenious way to explain what goes on inside a person's head, how emotions work, and how people deal with those emotions. By the end of it, their observations can be so utterly profound that one can easily forget the flaws that plague the second act. Who knew a story about an 11-year-old girl's emotions can be so moving and universal at the same time? While INSIDE OUT isn't up there with Pixar's masterpieces, it's a step towards the right direction.P.S. What was up with Lava? Definitely the worst Pixar short I've seen.",8,2,21,25 June 2015
Die Hard 2," Die Harder
","After the terrifying events in LA, John McClane is about to go through it all again. A team of terrorists, led by Col. Stuart is holding the entire airport hostage. The terrorists are planning to rescue a drug lord from justice. In order to do so, they have seized control of all electrical equipment affecting all planes. With no runway lights available, all aircraft have to remain in the air, with fuel running low, McClane will need to be fast.This is a Die Hard film so it must be entertaining, right? You are correct! Am I afraid to say this film is even better than the first film? No way! I'm going to say it right now! THIS FILM IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST!Now getting that out of the way, this is what you expect from a sequel: Bigger set pieces, more body counts, more and bigger explosions, many more people, and the same old McClane! However, it does surprise me that the film doesn't have as much action as the first film. If I look back correctly, McClane isn't an action hero until the last 10 minutes of the film!Now that isn't a bad thing. I'm kind of glad that it's different. This is an entertaining summer movie! Now changing my attitude, this film suffers from what the first one did: A long runtime. The movie overstays its welcome for about 30 minutes, and I mean it. I would've liked it to be a tight packed, fast-paced, action movie but whatever.Now what can I say about the performances? Bruce Willis plays the same character, flawlessly. It's really good! William Sadler, I guess, is a decent antagonist. Nothing really stands out for me except for him practicing to fight naked.What can you expect from this? Well, not necessarily more action scenes from Bruce Willis. Still, this film is a lot of fun to watch, although it overstayed its welcome. There are also some memorable lines. With everything mostly bigger, although not better, but in this case it is, this film is better than the first film but not the fourth.",8,6,8,18 March 2008
Quantum of Solace," Bond is Back
","Picking up minutes after 'Casino Royale,' this movie is about James Bond seeking revenge for the death of his loved one, while setting out to stop an environmentalist from taking control of a country's water supply.After the great 'Casino Royale,' a reboot to the 007 films, many people have set it high for 'Quantum of Solace.' No wonder it's not being as well received as 'Casino Royale.' Obviously, this film is not better than the one before it, but I still think it's a good step toward another Bond film, which will come, no doubt.'Casino Royale' lacked the action scenes in most 007 films. I think it's apparent that this film tries to make that up by filling this movie with as many action scenes as it can, without being too filled with action and little about plot. The action sequences in here are done so well, it should already earn you the price of admission to see this film. They're done that well.However, saying that, this Bond film is basically a revenge flick. There's a weak plot going under here. Bond is more PO'ed than ever, steering clear away from his character from being charming and charismatic and humorous to an efficient killing machine, along the lines of Jason Bourne in the Bourne series. In fact, how the action scenes are shot is like the Bourne series. Is that a good thing? I don't know.Daniel Craig is great again, reprising his role as Bond. I think he does a good job as the more revengeful, violent Bond. Bond girl Olga Kurylenko also does a very good job in here as well. However, poor Judi Dench has barely anything to do in the movie but to complain about Bond's behavior. Let's hope she does something better next time. The song being promoted in this movie was really cool and hip, in my opinion. I liked it a lot.Overall, perhaps this will disappoint a lot of fans who are devoted to this franchise. I'm not one whatsoever so I can care less if Bond is not Bond and more like Jason Bourne. The action sequences, again, are really well done. For that reason, and if you're an action freak, that should make you go see the movie. For everything else, it's not all great but I think it ends in a great setup for the next film. I particularly liked the ending.",7,2,7,7 December 2008
Independence Day," Mindless Fun
","The ultimate encounter when mysterious and powerful aliens launch an all out invasion against the human race. The spectacle begins when massive spaceships appear in Earth's skies. But wonder turns to terror as the ships blast destructive beams of fire down on cities all over the planet. Now the world's only hope lies with a determined band of survivors, uniting for one last strike against the invaders - before it's the end of mankind.I finally get to watch this film and yeah, I know I'm very late because I was never keen to watching it. This film was decent with it's above average action scenes and special effects only with a $75 million budget! The acting by Will Smith was comedic while Bill Pullman and Goldblum were both dramatic and comedic.I really think this film tries too hard to be a good film, which is why it wasn't as good as it want it to be. And I really don't know if this film tries to be funny or dramatic because it tries to be both but you really don't know when to laugh or feel sorry for the characters. It's like a cheesy line in those regular action movies.This will be known for an annual summer movie where you watch this film every summer. It's nothing bad about it but there's really nothing good about it if you want an alien invasion story.",6,0,1,21 May 2007
The Butterfly Effect," Change One Thing. Change Everything.
","This film is about a boy, Even Treborn, who has black outs. Since he was young, he has always has black outs so his psychiatrist told him to right in journals what he does everyday, like a diary. Now he's 20 and he finds a way to go back in time and see the black outs he once had when he was young. By reading his journals he has written when he was young, he can go back in time and change anything. Once he changes something to make it better, it alters his present.The concept, which was taken by the Chaos Theory, is quite ingenious. This film is very smart, itself. The Chaos Theory states that a butterfly's wing can cause a hurricane on the other side of the world. But in this movie, it only changes the character's lives revolved around the story, not outside the world.Now Ashton Kutcher is in a thriller, rather than the comedy movies he's always been in. His acting was great, by the way, as well as Amy Smart and Melora Walters.This is just a great film. Whenever Even changes one thing in his past, something is always flawed, to make it bad. Every lives change. Sometimes good things happen and sometimes bad things happen.This is a film for smart audiences. There are small detail you need to pay attention to get the movie right. And one more thing, it's really addictive to watch, in my opinion.",9,0,1,7 August 2006
Alien vs. Predator," Whoever Wins...We Enjoy the Movie
","An expedition of archaeologists on Earth discover an Aztec temple hidden under the Antarctic circle, housing a host of Alien creatures. A group of coming-of-age Predators have also come to the temple, as it has long been a training ground for their race. From there on, it's Aliens vs. Predators, with the humans caught in the middle.Since AVP was panned by critics and hated by fans, I want to show another perspective of the film. I liked it. You might say that this movie needed to have an R rating since the originals were R rated. You might be right but I, on the other hand, didn't mind. You might also say this film isn't a classic. Well, you might also be right, but I, on the other hand, didn't mind it was an entertaining popcorn movie.I'm not a fan of Alien or Predator, neither have I also seen the originals, which might be a reason why I liked this movie. Would it have affected my view on this movie have I seen the originals? Maybe but for a person who just went to see this film, that person will like it.This film is the definition of a popcorn film: Fantastic CGI with great action sequences, a murky plot, and and is just entertaining if you want to kill 90 minutes. I must admit I didn't like the plot. It was too ridiculous with the dumb characters but still, it attempted to be a popcorn film and it succeeded.For you people who are complaining Sanaa Lathan is trying to replace Sigourney Weaver: Shut up. Stop complaining. Lathan is not trying to get on the spotlight. I liked her performance in this film and I liked the fact this film gives unknown actors a chance at the big screen.You might also complain that this film is dumbed down for a wider audience. Well, that's you. I know most kills are off screen but I think they got away with a lot for this PG-13 rating. I liked the costumes of the Predators as well with the high tech modern technology they use. I like the look of the Aliens with slime. I liked the cinematography and the production design.If you're a fan of the originals, you might hate this film for being a popcorn dumbed-down movie. I don't blame you. But if you're a person who wants to watch a very entertaining popcorn film that doesn't mind it's hazy plot, you'll enjoy this as much as I did.",7,2,3,19 June 2007
District 9," You are not welcome here.
","Just like last year's CLOVERFIELD, TriStar Pictures have surprisingly managed to avoid giving away too much of the film in the trailers and TV spots. This is fortunate, because this is one of those films that is better the less you know about it, like ORPHAN, A PERFECT GETAWAY, and KNOWING. To continue this trend, I'll try to give little to no information about the movie in this review. The movie is about an extraterrestrial race being forced to live in slum conditions in District 9. That may give you a very vague idea of what's in this film and that's all I'll reveal.I must also add that this is nothing like CLOVERFIELD nor BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. The film is shot documentary style for most of the first few minutes of the film, but, overall, it's a straightforward narrative. What makes this such a great film is that it's fresh and original in its approach. It's an effects-heavy flick, yes, but it has a heart and soul. It's not a dumb action flick like TRANSFORMERS 2 or G.I. JOE and, on top of that, it deals with themes like prejudice, apartheid, greed, and several others that is too numerous to list here.However, if you're not that kind of a person who likes themes or allegory in their action movies, the film can be seen as an entertaining action flick with a plot and characters. Newcomer Sharlto Copley certainly does a swell job playing a quite multi-layered character. He's our protagonist in this film. The visual effects are surprisingly seamless, considering the fact that it has a relatively low budget ($30 million to be exact). I also liked the unique design of the aliens.The length for this review is shorter than most of my other's because I want you to walk into this movie with a clean slate. This is one of the most inventive movies I've ever seen this year and it's a fresh and unique take with aliens coming to Earth. After all, they didn't land in New York. The film is carried by a strong performance by Copley as well as a fantastic directorial debut by Neill Blomkamp. It also deals with some heavy subject matter, unusual for a summer flick, but it also has all the action that will satisfy your needs.",8,7,14,14 August 2009
Batman Begins," The Best Batman Movie Ever!
","When fate prevents him from avenging the deaths of his parents, young Bruce Wayne flees to Asia where he seeks counsel from a dangerous ninja cult leader known as Ra's al Ghul. When he returns, Bruce finds that Gotham City has become overrun with crime and corruption, and that there are forces at work trying to remove him from his inherited place as the owner of Wayne Industries. Discovering a cave under Wayne Manor, Bruce assumes a new identity as a secret detective and guardian of the people of Gotham City against the criminals that plague them.I have to say, this is the first Batman film I've ever liked. I never liked the original Batman nor the second and third sequels. This film finally got it right! It has a dark atmosphere and is serious. I liked that the film started with the origins because I haven't learned of Bruce's life, yet (until now).This film is somewhat disturbing with it's (I thought I would never say this) realistic action scenes with some scary effects to enhance it. I liked the overall look of the film (dark and gritty) with a fantastic score and some good CGI.Christian Bale plays a fantastic Bruce Wayne and a great Batman. I also liked the supporting roles by Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, and Liam Neeson. I also liked the plot of the movie.I really have nothing else to say. This is a really nice addition to Christopher Nolan's collection of fantastic films. This is one of the best superhero films ever created and it's no family friendly film.",10,2,2,20 June 2007
Twilight," When you can live forever what do you live for?
","Seventeen-year-old Isabella 'Bella' Swan moves to the small town of Forks, Washington, to live with her father. There, she finds herself drawn to a mysterious classmate, Edward Cullen, who is revealed to be a 108-year-old vampire but is physically seventeen. Although Edward discourages the romance at first, they soon fall deeply in love. When the arrival of three nomadic vampires puts Bella's life in danger, Edward and his family put their lives at stake to save her.You may question yourself now, 'What is with this hype?', 'Have the world gone mad?', or even 'Should I even see this?' You don't know what this is all about but you're curious. This is where I come in, and other millions of reviews you can read to gain answers from these questions and even millions more. No, I have not read the books. Actually, I have chosen to try to watch movies before I read their original sources because comparing the two can cause huge problems. *cough*Harry Potter*cough* No, I'm not a fan, so I WAS in the same boat as you. To start this off, I wasn't looking forward to this film. So why did I see this? My brother read the book and wanted to see the movie. But now I can say I left the theater with a huge smile on my face.So what is this hype? It's nothing different than the 'Harry Potter' frenzy and any other frenzy you can think of (LotR, Star Wars, etc). This is basically a vampire love story for this year's generation, and I'm part of it (which might be another reason the movie appealed to me). So what's different about this than other vampire love stories? I guess it has to deal with the young cast, which gives off a hint of freshness, if you ask me. No doubt, the target demographic for this film are the fans of the books, plus millions of teenage girls. If you're not apart of it, well, I guess you can do yourself a favor and skip this movie. It's not for you. Howver, there is a small chance for teenage guys and people who haven't read the books but are curious to see this movie to like the film. Hello, I'm one of them so take that risk if you will.The love story presented in the movie has a timeless feel to it. I'm a sentimental fellow so it's no surprise I was brought into it very quickly. However, that doesn't mean the movie is flawless. There are some moments in the film that is just downright cheesy and awkward. Take this scene, for example: The first time Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson meet each other is awkward, but this is probably a bad example because I think it was supposed to be that way. There are some lines in here that was also very awkward and cheesy. There's one about heroine. You don't want to know. But apart from those flaws, the film does a great job giving us a fantastic romance.A high point in this film is, surprisingly, the performances by almost everyone in the movie. Judging by the movie trailer, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson might give off some bad vibes but that's because you're not watching the movie as a whole. Trust me, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson both give off some fantastic performances, not to mention a great chemistry. The supporting cast also do a very great job as well, for what they're given.The music choices for this movie is very weird, but you'll get used to it. It's a mix of rock and perhaps Gothic (I couldn't tell, exactly). The direction by Catherine Hardwicke does a great job showing us some fantastic views of nature. In total, I was swept away by four fantastic sequences in the movie. I won't tell you because it'll ruin the surprise. One thing that bothered me about this film was that, and it may be just me, the film should've gotten a better distributer because the film looks low budget compared to other film adaptations and it is (a budget of about $37 million). I just wished that the film could've gotten a more well known distributer so that it could've gotten a bigger budget so the film would look less amateur and better special effects. Like I said, it may be only me.Overall, the film surprised me big time, surpassing way over my expectations and probably some other people that are going to see it too. If you're a fan of the books and/or a teenage girl, there's no doubt you should see this movie. If you're not, you probably will not like the movie, although there's still a small chance that this miracle can happen. If you're one of those people who feels like it's the end of the world because of this huge fan base and this huge success for this movie, don't complain because we all know this movie isn't for you so just stop whining that there will be an apocalypse. In the end, this movie is basically a huge setup for the next three movies (hopefully, they will get made) but that's not a bad thing because you get a great romance with a fantastic showdown in the end.",6,3,10,23 November 2008
Bridesmaids," Surprisingly Funny and Heartfelt!
","Annie's life is a mess. But when she finds out her lifetime best friend is engaged, she simply must serve as Lillian's maid of honor. Though lovelorn and broke, Annie bluffs her way through the expensive and bizarre rituals. With one chance to get it perfect, she'll show Lillian and her bridesmaids just how far you'll go for someone you love. (C) UniversalWhen I saw the trailer for BRIDESMAIDS, I didn't see anything special with it. There were maybe a couple of good jokes in there but nothing really hilarious to make me wanna see it right away. However, after the end credits rolled from a prescreening I went to, I have to admit it: It's freaking hilarious! To put this into perspective, I don't like many modern comedies, so this is saying a lot. There was one sequence in the film that was so funny and so shocking that I don't think I have ever laughed so hard in a film EVER! To say that the trailer doesn't do the film justice is an understatement. However, on the up side, the trailer doesn't show the funniest jokes in the film like most trailers for comedies do these days (don't you hate it when that happens?).And no. BRIDESMAIDS is not a chick flick. There are some raunchy scenes in here that you have NEVER seen in any other film before. Let's remember, this is a hard R-rated Judd Apatow production, so this film shouldn't be taken very lightly. It's not to say that BRIDESMAIDS is one of the best comedies of the decade. In fact, as much as I laughed throughout the film, it does slow down after the first hour with the second hour not being nearly as funny as the first. Still, I laughed out loud pretty frequently, which is a feat hard to pull off on someone like me.BRIDESMAIDS is also pretty heartfelt. This is mostly due to the wonderful ensemble cast, who are all fantastic in their own way. Kristen Wiig FINALLY gets the chance to shine in a starring role! Honestly, this girl can carry a film on her own. Maya Rudolph was also great. Seeing the dialogue exchange between her and Wiig made their chemistry feel very authentic which is no surprise since they were in SNL together. It's also fun to see Rose Byrne in more comedic roles, who was also in GET HIM TO THE Greek and this year's sleeper hit, INSIDIOUS(!!).I think an obvious audience favorite from the group of girls would be Melissa McCarthy. She provides some of the films biggest laughs and for a good reason. Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon-Covey are the remainders from the group and they were pretty good, but they aren't as prominent as the other girls. There are also some guys in the cast, most notably Chris O'Dowd and Jon Hamm. O'Dowd did a good job playing Wiig's love interest (and you can pretty much see where this is going...), and Hamm did well for the limited amount of screen time he had.Sure, BRIDESMAIDS is predictable as hell but so are 99.9% of other modern comedies. However, it's strong proof that one can make a comedy about women without it ever being stupid, sexist, or mean-spirited. Overall, it's just plain old entertaining, hilarious, and heartwarming. Who knew? Also, with the 'HANGOVER with girls' comparison, BRIDESMAIDS is a much funnier, insightful, and honest film than THE HANGOVER ever was.",9,70,131,29 April 2011
28 Days Later...," His fear began when he woke up alone. His terror began when he realized he wasn't.
","A powerful virus escapes from a British research facility. Transmitted in a drop of blood and devastating within seconds, the virus locks those infected into a permanent state of murderous rage. Within 28 days the country is overwhelmed and a handful of survivors begin their attempts to salvage a future, little realizing that the deadly virus is not the only thing that threatens them.This is one of the best horror films I've ever seen, let alone one of the best, if I must, 'zombie' movies I've ever seen. What makes this movie different from the other zombie movies out there? Well, there's a sense of humanism in here, which you would rarely find in horror movies. The movie has such great characters to care and cheer for. I just love it.Another thing that I liked about this movie is that the action scenes used in here helps us understand about human nature in such a state of crisis. I also love the unpredictable-ness in the film. You won't know what happen and who dies when, which is also rare in a horror film. Everything else in here is a ride.The performances by Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris are great. The movie is also different in a way because it's never always depressing. It's never always sad. There are some sweet scenes in here. Well, if you love horror films, this is a good movie to see. It's suspenseful, sweet, and thrilling.",8,2,3,1 September 2008
Drive," Some Heroes Are Real
","DRIVE tells the story of Driver (yes, that is his name), played by the wonderful Ryan Gosling. He's a stuntman and a 'driver-for-hire' (think THE TRANSPORTER), but above all, he's good at driving. No, he's the best at driving, or at least that's what we're told, but it doesn't take us long to believe that once the film opens with a car chase that is something that should be experienced. The sequence starts off quietly but builds up in nail-biting suspense with each second. If that wasn't enough, the fantastic soundtrack will suck you in. It's wonderfully shot and cleanly edited, nothing like you'd see in a Hollywood action film these days. And it's clear, DRIVE is nothing like a Hollywood film, defying conventions and deliberate in pace. I'd say it's something like an art-house action flick but on with the story.Driver meets his beautiful neighbor, Irene, played by Carey Mulligan, whose husband is in jail. The two click instantly with a look. Since Driver isn't the talkative type, they don't get to speak to each other much. In a scene where they are alone, they just stare into their eyes, one smiling to the other. It's an endearing scene where the actors' expressions seem more important and effective than dialogue. However, Irene's husband eventually does come home, and that's when bad things start to happen. I will not reveal what occurs because you should just really watch the whole thing unravel. Additionally, avoid the trailer because it unfortunately gives a lot of plot points away. However, I will say it gets very violent and bloody.DRIVE wants the audience to get to know its characters before starting the action, and it's obvious that this is Ryan Gosling's film. Let me just say that I think Gosling is a terrific actor, from his roles in HALF NELSON to BLUE VALENTINE to LARS AND THE REAL GIRL. This guy can act, and his talent remains apparent with his first action role in DRIVE. Even though his character doesn't talk much, Gosling is able to command the camera with a single look. He brings a large presence throughout the film, only talking when he needs to. Carey Mulligan is also very good, and I should say that she is a terrific actress as well and at such a young age! The two definitely have great chemistry with each other. Bryan Cranston is Bryan Cranston. What can I say? If you've seen BREAKING BAD, you know how good he is. He's just wonderful in here. The remaining major supporting actors do just as a great job in their roles as everyone else, including Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Ron Perlman. and Christina Hendricks.With a tight direction by Nicolas Winding Refn, wonderful performances from a knock-out cast, and tense action scenes, DRIVE is quite something. Even though the story may feel familiar, the art-house style of the film makes it refreshing. I can guarantee that not everyone will like it, but it should be seen.",8,11,28,9 September 2011
2012," We Were Warned.
","Roland Emmerich has given movie watchers several apocalyptic films in the past in INDEPENDENCE DAY and THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, and he offers another look at the end of the world in 2012.From THE FINAL DESTINATION to WOLVERINE and even WATCHMEN, there have been some disappointing movies this year. There's no doubt on that. Saying that, 2012 is not only the mother of all disaster movies, it may be one of the most satisfactory movies of this year, mainly because it delivers on what audiences expect and even more.Now we have seen disaster movies millions of times. We know the formula: You have a bunch of survivors who don't work well with each other at first but later become a 'family' once they have been through the disaster, or, in this case, disasters. 2012 is formulaic to its core. It even has that dog that we all root for to survive, but it's a formula for a reason and when a movie works it so well, you can't help but stand up and cheer when the end credits roll.This is 2012. One big, major reason this movie is sooooo good is because of the effects, the CGI. They are AH-MAZE-ING. The details put in almost every disaster sequences is commendable to say the least. In one sequence, we can literally see tiny people getting crushed and killed by flying cars, falling towers, and Earth's shaking crust from down below. Remember that chase scene in THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW where that group of people ran away from frozen ice? Well, there's an earthquake chase scene in here, which I know you have all seen in one case or another, that makes that other chase scene look like a baby struggling to walk for the first time. It's just that good.Even the script is good. Sure, there are some laughable lines, but that's normal for a disaster movie. The characters are also very lovable. The film has a very diverse ensemble cast, with probably three main characters and many other secondary characters running around, and most of them work. John Cusack does a very fine job in his role, the great actor as he is. The character he plays is very sympathetic and caring. Chiwetel Ejiofor also has a main role here and does a great job with his role as one of the scientists.2012 is sometimes funny, sometimes sad, at times tear jerking, but, on top of all that, it's very entertaining from beginning to end. THIS is how you make a disaster movie. Of course, director Roland Emmerich should know that himself. He's, after all, the master of disaster. Sure, this may look like many other disaster movies you've seen, and it is, but you've never seen one quite like this. It gives you everything you want only bigger and louder and with some of the best CGI I've ever seen in cinematic history. If you go in expecting the mother of all disaster movies, you'll sure as hell get what you want.",9,2,6,29 November 2009
The Number 23," The truth will find you
","On his birthday, Walter Sparrow, an amiable dog-catcher, takes a call that leaves him dog bit and late to pick up his wife. She browsed in a bookstore, finding a novel, a murder mystery with numerology that loops constantly around the number 23. The story captivates Walter: he dreams it, he notices aspects of his life that can be rendered by '23,' he searches for the author, he stays in the hotel where events in the novel took place, and he begins to believe it was no novel. His wife and son try to help him, sometimes in sympathy, sometimes to protect him. Slowly, with danger to himself and to his family, he closes in on the truth.Many people, with the critics, have panned this film. Well, I actually don't know about the people, per se, but I know that a lot of people did not like this movie. I gave it a watch and it's not as bad as many people put it out to be, even the Razzie nomination to Jim Carrey. This film may be ridiculous because you get a set of numbers, and it all equals the number 23. Well, how you got that in the first place is to put the numbers in different order, or add or subtract or multiply or divide, or put the numbers in fractions, or decimals, or....you know what I'm saying. In order to get the number 23, you'll have to do many of those things...however, that is the point of the film.Who cares if you have to do all these crazy stuff with numbers. It's better to just go with it than to question a billion of things that comes into your mind when watching the film. Watch and enjoy; that's all I'm saying. When I saw the film, I was pleasantly surprised on how close you have to pay attention to small details and how intelligent the film wants the audience to be.So you get to get caught up in this ridiculous act with the characters in the film to do something that leads to the number 23. Maybe your name, phone number, licenses, etc will equal 23. Maybe not, but this film catches your attention from the first scene and it will continue to do so until the end.The problem with this film, however, is that it tries to get too clever and smart that you just don't seem to care about halfway through the film. The film also feels entirely so long, when the film is actually about 90 minutes. I did like the ending, though. It was really different and satisfying.Everyone gives a good performance in here. In fact, the same actors/actresses play different characters at once. Is it to confuse you? Probably not. The film was good and some dumb fun, with some slow parts, but in the end, it's a truly satisfying film for me.",6,1,3,9 April 2008
Ghost Rider," Why Wasn't This Screened to the Critics?
","Johnny Blaze, a stunt motorcyclist, made a deal with the Devil to give up his soul to save his father. His father died in an accident and now Johnny has no soul. He and the Devil meets again and the Devil will give him his soul back if Johnny gives the Devil the contract, which contains 300 souls, but the Devil's son, Blackheart, also tries to get it.I didn't see this film in the theater but if I did tell you where I've seen it, well, that won't be the case, is it? I want to ask myself why wasn't this film screened to the critics. At least Elektra, a little better film, had the courage to do so.This film is different then what is shown in TV spots and trailers. In fact, there's much less action in the film than you expected and more of the cheesy romance story between the guy and the girl he likes. This continues with cheesy dialog and predictable plot.Although it has its flaws, this film is just mindless fun. It has good special effects and some great action scenes. There are even some funny scenes in the film. The acting in the film by Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes is mediocre at its best.Although not as good as all serious superhero film, this film will entertain and not to be taking seriously but has a very predictable plot that has 'The Covenant' looking villain.",6,0,2,28 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Take a Stand
","When a cure is found that could turn mutants back to 'normal,' the reactions seem polar. Some, like Magneto, deeply oppose to it, while others, like Rogue, want the cure as soon as possible. As a war is brewing between the mutants and the humans, can the X-Men stop Magneto and his destruction?Let me start off to say this: The plot for the film is really great. Honestly, I think it's the best out of the trilogy, seeing how it's very political and it offers much more than usual superhero movies. One can even make up a metaphor, and, probably, there is a social commentary being said here. I really appreciated that. However, this was a disappointing film.After what has been set up in the excellent part two in the trilogy, it wasn't not hard to see that this one would fall short, like many threequals. The running time is so short that not even many of the new characters are on screen long enough, let alone many major characters left in the dust. Also, although the story is excellent, the execution is mediocre, replacing character development from the last two chapters and replacing it with more explosions and action scenes, which, I must admit, are quite amazing.You might even find yourself amazed at how many major characters are being killed off, possibly just for the sake of trying to limit down the millions of characters on screen already. Even characters like Mystique, Rogue, and Cyclops, major characters in the last two films, can be missed if you blink once on the screen. Saying that, the film manages to do well with cramming millions of things in one short film. The story may be a little fast paced, and maybe there's no time to stop and feel for characters being killed off, but it's good enough for what it has.As said earlier, the action sequences are amazing. The special effects are flawless. I even liked the new characters on board, like Ellen Page, Vinnie Jones, and Ben Foster. The original cast also do well here, Hugh Jackman with his tough attitude and Halle Berry with a new hairdo. Overall, it's not the sequel one might hope for, especially if it's the end of a trilogy, but it's good enough for what it is: An entertaining, fast paced romp. Let's just hope they make another sequel.",6,0,0,1 May 2009
Across the Universe," All you need is love
","An original musical film, Across The Universe is a fictional love story set in the 1960s amid the turbulent years of anti-war protest, the struggle for free speech and civil rights, mind exploration and rock and roll. At once gritty, whimsical and highly theatrical, the story moves from high schools and universities in Massachusetts, Princeton and Ohio to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the Detroit riots, Vietnam and the dockyards of Liverpool. A combination of live action and animation, the film is paired with many songs by The Beatles that defined the time.Note: I am not a Beatles' fan. I have never been one and probably will never be, even after watching this film. I am only familiar with a couple of their more famous songs and I'm a fan of musicals. Now, I will say this film is extremely creative with its art direction, production design, choreograph, and anything else from the brilliant mind of Julie Taymor. However, I was kind of disappointed with the film as a musical.I really don't like much of the Beatles' songs. In the film, you'll hear about 35. Out of those selected 35 songs, I would count 3 as some very good songs and 7 as good songs. Yeah, I'm not really into their music as much as the billions of people around the world. I just expected better songs, you know? However, I enjoyed the film.When you first watch this film, it's hard to determine whether you will like or hate the film. In fact, it can polarize audiences. I felt like I could've hated or loved the film because some musical spots were fantastic and creative while others are incredibly horrible, in my opinion. I did like the cameo by Bono.The new, fresh faces in this movie is good. As an ensemble, they're decent, compared to other ensemble-type musical films. The story, unfortunately, is kind of predictable. You might already know what happens to the guy and the girl and the whole formulaic thing behind that.If you're a Beatles' fan, I don't know if you will like the film or not. I'm not so sure. I'm just an outsider who was just excited to see a musical, in which so many people I knew loved. This film could probably make you hate what they've done with The Beatles or love The Beatles even more because you've seen this film. It's your choice.",6,0,1,9 April 2008
The Incredibles," Save The Day
","Mr. Incredible is a superhero; or he used to be, until a surge of lawsuits against superheroes submitted by the people they've saved forced the government to hide them in witness protection programs so they could lead normal, anonymous lives. Now known exclusively by his secret identity, Bob Parr, he lives with his wife Helen, formerly Elastigirl, and their three children Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack. He works as an insurance claims specialist, and he's fed up with his pushy boss and his immoral profession, but his wife's worked too hard to build a normal life for her family to abide his nostalgia for heroism.When Mr. Incredible's offered the chance to play the role of hero again by a mysterious informant, he jumps at the opportunity, but when it turns out to be a trap set by an old nemesis he had a hand in corrupting, the whole family must reveal themselves to save Mr. Incredible and countless innocents.I was expecting for this movie to be hilarious or very funny. Well, I was quite disappointed. Yeah, there were a few chuckles here and there, but nothing to make me laugh out loud. Maybe this wasn't a comedy. It's a superhero film, of course. So, I was quite surprise with the fantastic action sequences, filled with explosions here and there and some smart action!The animation is so fantastic (not to mention it's similar to Fantastic Four)! This film much darker than most Pixar films, and a lot more violent. There were even some tense scenes for me, but it was great because it's geared towards kids and adults who could enjoy the movie together instead of having a complaint to take your kids to see this!For a superhero movie, it's a really fantastic one. It's one of the best ever made! The characters are lovable and the story is great! I love Brad Bird's homage to many films and all of that jazz! This is just a great film for the family. The score is also great.Although not hilarious as I thought it would be, this is a great addition to the Pixar films. They always manage to make some of the greatest animation flicks ever made. Watch this with your family and you'll have an explosive good time!",10,1,1,26 May 2007
The Mist," Fear Changes Everything
","After a violent storm attacks a town in Maine, an approaching cloud of mist appears the next morning. As the mist quickly envelops the area, a group of people get trapped in a local grocery store-among them, artist David Drayton and his five-year-old son. The people soon discover that within the mist lives numerous species of horrific, unworldly creatures that entered through an inter-dimensional rift, which may or may not have been caused by a nearby military base. As the world around them manifests into a literal hell-on-earth, the horrified citizens try desperately to survive this apocalyptic disaster.'The Mist' is one of those movies people won't ever want to watch a second time. No, it's not the reason that the movie is bad. It's the fact that this film may take a toll on you. It did to me. I'm pretty sure I'm so emotionally drained from this movie, that I wish I would've never seen this film. '1408,' another Stephen King adaptation does the same thing, but not in the same level as this film.With that as a huge warning before seeing the film, I liked the film a lot. You might've heard things before seeing the movie, like the horrible ending people are keep talking about. Well, the ending could be the most worst thing to have ever happened on screen or the most realistic. I choose realistic. Most would pick the other and I really don't blame them.One can see a similarity between this film and 'Lord of the Flies.' In fact, I think Stephen King wrote 'The Mist' inspired by 'Lord of the Flies.' It wouldn't surprise me. Horror movies these days don't include scenes that happen in 'The Mist.' The characters in here are all great, each played well by each cast member. The movie focuses away on the 'things' outside the mist and focuses more on the 'breaking apart' of a once civilized population, just like 'Lord of the Flies.'The violence and gore are still there. There are enough to make a horror fan happy. The special effects are great, in my opinion. Frank Darabont, once again, does not disappoint with a brilliant film. I found the cinematography strange and unique. You'll see why once you see the film. But to anyone who wants to see this film, I am warning you that it's a dark piece of film which portrays everything, in my opinion, realistically, and will emotionally drain you to death.",7,0,2,18 June 2008
Stardust," This summer a star falls. The chase begins.
","In a countryside town bordering on a magical land, a young man makes a promise to his beloved that he'll retrieve a fallen star by venturing into the magical realm.Instead of seeing 'Rush Hour 3' with everyone else, I saw Stardust, instead. And you know what? I bet you Stardust is the better movie. Last year's 'Pan's Labyrinth' showed us the dark side of fairy tales. Now in this year, Stardust is about to do the same thing, only, it's not as dark.Is Stardust a children's movie? Well, it's scarier and more violent than most. How violent can it get with a PG-13? Well, you would be surprised how far they pushed the envelope. But does that really mean it is not for children? Certainly not. If you like magic or fairy tales, this movie will do. To be honest, I will even go as far as to say this film is better than 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' because it really is.This film is surprisingly imaginative. People teleport with candles, fire burns green, pirates fly, and there are tons more to go. What more can you want? Is this film funny? It's weirdly humorous, if that's possible. It's like a fresh work of comedy, since you have never seen anything like it.The CGI ranges from cheesy to fantastic. The makeup effects are great. The chemistry between Charlie Cox and Claire Danes is also really good. Michelle Pfeiffer plays an evil, dark witch and performances by Jason Flemyng and Mark Strong is also good and everyone has their chance do make a joke every now and then in the movie.This film is hugely entertaining and from all the sequels and remakes this summer, you will want to watch this fresh and original movie because it feels good when you finally get a breath of fresh air. The imagination is there and the performances good. And parents, instead of seeing 'Daddy Day Camp' with your kids, I rather you watch this film with them, if they like Harry Potter. Stardust is a magical and stunning piece of work.",7,1,1,16 August 2007
I Am Legend," The last man on earth is not alone
","Robert Neville is a brilliant scientist, but even he could not contain the terrible virus that was unstoppable, incurable, and man-made. Somehow immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City and maybe the world. But he is not alone. Mutant victims of the plague lurk in the shadows. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But he knows he is outnumbered...and quickly running out of time.With its very high budget and an all star actor, this film manages to be unlike any other apocalyptic film you've ever seen. Yes, there's New York. Yes, people are killed. Yes, the future looks depressing. No, there aren't many action scenes. No, there isn't blood, gore, and violence.This is The Host of 2007...well, The host was released in 2007, so it's like The Host. Why? There is a great performance in this film: The actor is Will Smith, obviously. Yet, this film is underwhelming. It's different because there are so few action scenes and too much slow moments in the film (of course, with one person in the majority of the film).In The Host, you expect a monster movie, yet most of it is filled with character development and not enough monster attacking, which makes it underwhelming. In this film, you expect more zombie violence, yet there's only like three scenes of that in the whole film, which makes this film underwhelming. Is that a good thing? Sure, but we need more action.Now, I may sound like an idiot by saying more action will make this film good, but no. I just thought it would've been more interesting if there were a few more zombie violence and less quietness. Still, I can't help the fact that this film manages to be disturbing and eerie with the limited scenes of zombies.This is not your usual big budget movie. Yes, it has explosions (many, in fact) and some action sequences but not enough to satisfy an audience looking for something to happen. Still, Will Smith is great and the silence in the movie will get deadly. Overall, this is an underwhelming yet satisfying film.",7,1,8,15 December 2007
School of Rock," Few Films Are Like This These Days
","After being fired from his own band, the guitar player Dewey Finn needs to raise some money to pay for his rent and his bills. When his friend and school teacher Ned Schneebly is called to a temporary work in an expensive private school, Dewey pretends to be Ned and accepts the job. He finds talented young musicians in his class, and he decides to form a rock-and-roll band with the students and win a competition called 'Battle of Bands' to raise the prize and be recognized in the show business.This film is fantastic after a few minutes. It's what you want in a great and fantastic film. I don't know why it's PG-13, though because it's a great family film. This is why films are made, considering this is one of the best films ever (not even exaggerating).The film gives some good laughs, great kids who can play instruments when they are so young, and the execution is just really good. I don't know why but I love to praise this film a lot and to know it's a Jack Black film! The acting by Jack Black was fine as were the kids. This film is not meant to be taken seriously. It rocks and has great music and brings us to the life on band. There are even memorable scenes in the movie. Each kid has their own 'great' scene.If you know why films were made, this is why. These few films that are memorable good, fantastic from beginning to end, and all of that until the funny ending credits. That's why this film is so good.",9,0,0,8 May 2007

In the year of his 48th birthday (the age his father committed suicide) his brother Conrad, who has gone long ago and surrendered to addictions of all kinds, suddenly returns and gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to unusual entertainment provided by something called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Giving up to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and all kinds of weird and bad things start to happen to him.If I had to pick one thing out of this movie that would have people talking for days or even months, or why the movie is talked about so many times (I assume, when it came out) was because of the ending. The TWIST ending. You're thinking it's just another twist ending, right? WRONG. This ending would either make you HATE the movie or LOVE the movie. At first, I didn't like it, or better phrased, I didn't get used to it. I may suggest people to see this movie more than once to get used to the ending because it's going to be stuck in your throat for quite awhile.So what's so controversial about this twist ending? I don't know. Well, I do know but you have to find out for yourself. I'm not going to ruin the surprise. I've probably build it so much that you're wanting to watch this movie already. I'm sorry I did that. Let's get back on topic. What I loved about the movie, after seeing it for the second time and after I got used to what I just saw, I loved the twist ending because it provides a moral. Yes, indeed the ending provides a moral, much along like a fairy tale story. It's like loving 'Citizen Kane' because of its ending.However, the whole movie was very ingenious. Very unpredictable, I must add. This may be even one of the most unpredictable movie you'll ever see in your life! *sigh* OK. This movie will sure make you think a lot. Before I continue, I literally thought about this movie in my sleep the day I saw it. I was still thinking about it when I woke up. That's how great this movie is! It's one of those movies that will have people talking for days and days! OK, well, the first few minutes of the film really pulled me in. I was intrigued. VERY intrigued.However, there came a point when the movie did lose its steam. It's when Deborah Kara Unger comes in. Now, I would've just preferred her to not be part of this movie or, better yet, not come as early into the film because I liked Sean Penn playing the game by himself and not with a partner. That's just me, though.But overall, I loved the plot for the film and it did keep me guessing from beginning to end. My mind was literally blank. I love the whole puzzle feeling from the film. It gives you one piece at a time until the ending where it puts all of the pieces together. It was really great to have seen this movie. It gives us an important lesson (but I'm not going to say a thing) and this thriller is just that unpredictable that you can't believe it!",8,1,2,19 November 2008
Kick-Ass," I can't read your mind. But I can kick your ass.
","'How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?' When Dave Lizewski dons a wetsuit to become the no-nonsense vigilante, Kick-Ass, he soon finds an answer to his own question: because it hurts. But, overcoming all the odds, Dave quickly becomes a phenomenon, capturing the imagination of the public. However, he's not the only superhero out there – the father-daughter crime-fighting duo, Big Daddy and Hit Girl, have been taking down the criminal empire of local Mafioso, Frank D'Amico. And, as Kick-Ass gets drawn into their world of bullets and bloodletting with Frank's son, Chris, the stage is set for a final showdown between the forces of good and evil - in which the DIY hero will have to live up to his name. Or die trying...KICK-ASS is one of those movies that is difficult to market to the mainstream audience, especially since the opening weekend for this film was disappointing. It has a lot of bloody violence along with a little girl who makes people think that this is a kiddie flick and the fact that this film is rated R just brings a whole lot of mess and confusion to the table of what this film really is. The best way I can describe what this film is is SPIDER MAN mixed with ZOMBIELAND without the zombies.Unlike the title of the film might suggest, Kick-Ass does end up being overshadowed by the characters of Big Daddy and Hit Girl. In fact, I'll even go as far to say that Hit Girl herself made the movie what it is. She's such a fantastic, awesome, wild, brilliant, colorful, bad-ass character that I liked her more than Kick-Ass. Chloe Moretz plays the said character so well, that she lightens up the screen every time she comes on. You thought the profanity-mouthed kid in ROLE MODELS was shocking? You haven't seen anything yet.However, saying that, Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass did a great job as well. I can relate to the nerd-type character he plays. Nicolas Cage is a mixed-bag. In some scenes, he's brilliant, while in others, he's rather weird. Mark Strong as the villain is more of the same from SHERLOCK HOLMES a couple of months back. Still, he has some great scenes with comic timing. Christopher Mintz-Plasse doesn't have much screen time as the trailers suggested, but he's good for the amount of time he appears in the film.It's apparent the main goal of the film is to entertain its audience and it succeeds at that. The film is filled with bloody violence, vulgar language, and big laughs, most coming from my favorite character Hit Girl. Because of this, however, the many themes touched upon in this film is never fully explored, which could have made the movie a so much better. There are some really moving scenes as well, along with suspense in the fantastically shot action scenes.The main flaw of the film comes from the tone. It found a hard time whether to be a straight-up comedy or a dramedy because somewhere in this film, it does get serious and dark, unlike the marketing might have suggested. In some parts of the film, I didn't know when to laugh or not. Because of this, I didn't enjoy the film as much as I would have enjoyed it.However, with these flaws aside, director Matthew Vaughn successfully delivers to the audience an action-packed popcorn flick with great characters. I found the movie to be ludicrously entertaining from beginning to end with a lot of big laughs and some bad ass action scenes. This is the very definition of an awesome movie. I know I'm not the first person to say this but KICK-ASS kicks ass (for the most part).",7,4,14,18 April 2010
Shrek the Third," It's Just Decent
","When his new father-in-law, King Harold falls ill, Shrek is looked at as the heir to the land of Far Far Away. Not one to give up his beloved swamp, Shrek recruits his friends Donkey and Puss in Boots to install the rebellious Artie as the new king. Princess Fiona, however, rallies a band of royal girlfriends to fend off a coup d'etat by the jilted Prince Charming.I have to admit, I really wasn't as hyped to see this film than Shrek 2. The trailer was okay, the plot sounds less interesting, and many critics didn't like this film. Yeah, this film is full of energetic characters and some visually dazzling scenes, but it's not as funny, entertaining, or as great as the last two films.If you've seen the trailer, that's probably all the good jokes that they got in the film. I expected to laugh as much as I did at Shrek 2, since this film is more for the adults than the kids to enjoy. It's a sad fact that more of the jokes comes from secondary characters than the main ones. The action scenes were good, not great, but the story just doesn't interest me.And the Shrek and Fiona spark isn't as much there as it were in the previous two films. Now here's the good: I liked the secondary characters. They are all funny. This is the most visual Shrek film, having colorful scenes pop out.This film seems to rely more on the slapstick humor to cover up the weak plot, seemed to not be filled with originality. I didn't mind that. There are some pretty good jokes and some good action scenes. Don't watch this film expecting a great film like the first two, although I wanted this to be a worthy sequel.",6,59,85,25 May 2007
Back to the Future Part III," Worse of the Trilogy
","Stranded in 1955, Marty McFly receives written word from his friend, Doctor Emmett Brown, as to where can be found the DeLorean time machine. However, an unfortunate discovery prompts Marty to go to his friend's aid. Using the time machine, Marty travels to the old west where his friend has run afoul of a gang of thugs and has fallen in love with a local schoolteacher. Using the technology from the time, Marty and Emmett devise one last chance to send the two of them back to the future.Okay, after setting the bar way too high from the second film, I thought I would see the same over-complicated time travel movie. However, I was wrong. In fact, this movie is more laid back. There's no time limit (well, there is). But it's mostly lackluster if you expect something big (excluding the last twenty minutes).In this film, there is no jumping back and forth with oh so complicated situations like the second. The characters just stay in one place to solve one problem. There isn't as much fun in here as I expected. There are still some laughs but not as much as the last two.Even as the conclusion of the trilogy, Robert Zemeckis couldn't create a good (or unique) enough story to continue with. Basically, if you think this movie is much grander and bigger, you'll be disappointed. All you'll get is a lackluster conclusion. At least you have some fun.",6,5,8,27 December 2007
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," The Next Chapter Begins
","After Bella recovers from the vampire attack that almost claimed her life, she looks to celebrate her birthday with Edward and his family. However, a minor accident during the festivities results in Bella's blood being shed, a sight that proves too intense for the Cullens, who decide to leave the town of Forks, Washington for Bella and Edward's sake. Initially heartbroken, Bella finds a form of comfort in reckless living, as well as an even-closer friendship with Jacob Black. Danger in different forms awaits.I have to admit it. I enjoyed the first film, TWILIGHT, very much so. I'm a sentimental guy so I was swept away easily by the romance between Edward and Bella. To make it clear for anyone of you out there, the TWILIGHT series are not vampire movies. Instead, think of them as a ROMEO AND JULIET story WITH vampires. Some people like these kinds of things. Others don't. I'll try to refrain from saying only teenage girls would love this movie because when I went to see this movie, there were people between the ages of 2 months and 65 years old, half split with males and females. I guess the stereotype wasn't true after all.You can automatically feel a huge difference between this and the first film. This film is definitely much more slower paced. While never boring, it's quite a drag since it's over two hours long. Although it starts off slow, the ball does get rolling after Edward leaves Bella by herself. Unfortunately, it's also much more moodier, but I guess teen relationships are like that, aren't they? On top of that, the story isn't really all that interesting. After all, it's mostly about Bella being depressed when Edward leaves her. The finale seemed a bit rushed too with little payoff.However, all is not bad. Director Chris Weitz does a much better job in here than Catherine Hardwicke, giving the film a distinctive look in the title sequence alone. If you may remember, I complained that the first film had too low of a budget to make it look like a blockbuster like it is. However, the problem is quickly fixed since the budget is twice as large as the first, which helped make the film look less like a CW TV show than before. The special effects are put to good use here, especially for the werewolves, an addition that makes the story much more interesting. The score by Alexandre Desplat is really fantastic. See how much a bigger budget can help a movie?Kristen Stewart does a great job in here as always. I think she grounds the movie to reality. Although Robert Pattinson is underused here, along with most of the case, he's good with the small amount of screen time he has. Taylor Lautner gets a much bigger role in here, which is fortunate not only for the Twihards out there but for everyone else too, because he makes the movie more interesting. As stated before, many of the cast members are underused. Remember Rachelle Lefevre, playing Victoria, the villain, who was part of the cliffhanger ending in the first film? Well, we see her for brief moments in here, totaling up her screen time for only seconds.The story is much more moodier and less interesting in here, in my opinion, compared to the first. The characters are in here mostly to mope and be depressed because of a such complicated relationship. However, the technicality is much improved, from the cinematography to the score. Director Chris Weitz does his best here, along with the rest of the cast. It's a decent sequel to a good movie but it could have been much better. Maybe the screenwriter should cut out some unnecessary bits from the novels to make it more interesting. A little action wouldn't hurt, would it? Don't you just hate it when someone you love turns out to be a vampire? I think Bella needs a break.",6,3,11,22 November 2009
The Illusionist," Nothing is what it seems
","A young boy falls in love with a girl that is way above his social standards along with the art of magic. Although the parents forbid them of seeing each other they cannot be split apart. Until one day they were found together and the boy was sent off. He became a magician and traveled the world. She fell in love with another man, the Crown Prince. The two got engaged but the boy, Eisenheim, finally meets back up with the girl and uses his powers to free her from the royal house in Vienna.There was a movie that came out in 2004. It was called 'Saw', a film known by many for its twist ending. I gave that film a perfect rating just for its ending and I suppose many others did as well. And giving that film a perfect rating just for its ending (I know, it's stupid), why not give this movie a perfect rating for its great ending?I'm not giving this film a perfect rating only because of its ending, like I did 'Saw'. This film is immensely absorbing and spellbinding. It will keep your attention throughout the film and you'll love every second of it.Edward Norton's performance is great, having less dialog in its second hour and does his performance with his actions. Paul Giamatti's performance was surprisingly good, acting in a subtle way and Jessica Biel's performance was good.Unlike many films, The Illusionist's ending doesn't cheat the audience. It works, although you don't buy some things that are happening. You would rather just keep your mouth shut and go along with the ride.",8,0,0,26 August 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Fantasitc Fun!
","With Von Doom back in his homeland of Latveria the fantastic four have new troubles when Galactus has decided that Earth is his next target. When his henchman, The Silver Surfer, is sent to Earth he discovers that he's getting more than he bargained for when he encounters the Fantastic Four. But that's not all when Dr. Doom decides that after two years in the homeland he is ready to return.With it's short running time, FF2 is a fast paced movie. It doesn't waste anytime on anything and gets right to the point. It's more or less a popcorn film because it's really not all about the action. This film is even better than the first film (although not as good as the extended cut of the first film). There is more character development, more intense, and more dramatic.With more dramatic scenes, there are also more comedic scenes, most for both the children and the adults to enjoy. The problem is that this movie switches from drama to comedy in scenes. If you want it to be funny, go with it and vice versa.Although with the PG rating, there is even more intense action sequences and a death scene that pushes the PG rating a bit. The CGI in here ranges from being bad to fantastic with some things you can feast your eyes on. I like the acting by cooler Ioan Gruffudd, the sexier Jessica Alba, the handsomer Chris Evans, and the, well, Michael Chiklis.I also want to attack a 'problem' in this film that people are complaining about: Galactus. Yes, many will be disappointed on how he appears in the movie or that he appears at all but isn't this film called 'Rise of the Silver Surfer'? So please, don't be surprised of how Galactus appears.Although not as good as Spider-Man 3, this film is harmless fun for the family. There are more action sequences and comedy. It doesn't take itself seriously like the more serious superhero films (ala Batman Begins, Superman Returns, Spider-Man). It's an okay adaptation for Silver Surfer (there will be a spin-off), but many people will be surprised this film will exceed their expectations.",6,22,43,18 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Life isn't measured in minutes, but in moments .
","Adapted from the 1920s story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' follows the life of Benjamin Button, who is born with the appearance and physical limitations of a man who is 87 years old. Abandoned in a nursing home by his father, Benjamin begins aging backward on the outside of his body. While in the home, he meets Daisy, a young aspiring ballerina. As the film progresses, the two fall in love, while struggling to deal with the issue of one growing younger while the other grows older.My favorite film from David Fincher is 'Zodiac.' By the end of the film, I found it quite surprising 'Benjamin Button' wasn't all as great as people hype it to be. Don't be surprised when you find this film not as great as you imagined it to be. The hype makes the film much more than what it really is. However, that doesn't make the film bad. In fact, it's really fantastic, but, again, not as good as you would've wanted it to be.What starts off on a mediocre note, 'Benjamin Button' is like other films you've seen before. You see this old woman, Daisy, in this hospital. Her daughter is sitting next to her. The mother tells her to read off a diary, written by the man she loved. Then starts off the journey of the film. While the story goes on, once in awhile, or quite often, the story stops and goes back to present day. I found that quite annoying. It does break the flow of the film but I guess all movies do that.Filled with flaws like that, 'Benjamin Button' is not a perfect film. The film is awfully long that I found some points in the film very pointless and have no meaning to the story whatsoever. However, I guess the point of the film is to show the life of Benjamin and not the romance tale between him and Daisy, which I thought would've been just as good a movie, making it probably forty-five minutes shorter. This being said, the best parts of the whole movie was the romance tale between Benjamin and Daisy.As the film progresses, the film turns mediocre to great until the brilliant last act. The fairy tale has a very timeless feel to it and I guess that's what made the film so great. Brad Pitt does a great job portraying Benjamin at various ages. When Cate Blanchett comes in, she, as well, does a great job with her role. Supporting roles like Taraji P. Henson and even cameo roles like Tilda Swinton do their best for the movie.Like Fincher's previous work, 'Benjamin Button' has a great look throughout the film, portraying different pieces of time fantastically and believably. On the same level, the costumes are great as well as the special effects. In the end, 'Benjamin Button' is not perfect, but I didn't care. It's a fantastic film filled with flaws and it's proud of that fact. I think it's a great fairy tale for everyone, excluding kids, to see. While not the best film of the year, it's pretty high up there as well as being the most ambitious work from Fincher.",9,9,19,26 December 2008
Transformers," More than Meets the Eye
","High-school student Sam Witwicky buys his first car, who is actually the Autobot Bumblebee. Bumblebee defends Sam and his girlfriend Mikaela Banes from the Decepticon Barricade, before the other Autobots arrive on Earth. They are searching for the Allspark, and the war on Earth heats up as the Decepticons attack a United States military base in Qatar. Sam and Mikaela are taken by the top-secret agency Sector 7 to help stop the Decepticons, but when they learn the agency also intends to destroy the Autobots, they formulate their own plan to save the world.I was quite surprised that many people were at the earliest showing today, July 4th. Hoping to watch the movie with a couple of people with teenagers and crying babies away, I was quite disappointed but it didn't ruin my movie experience.The film was decent. This is coming from a guy who knows nothing about Transformers. The oh-so-incredible action sequences weren't that good and the plot, well, you know, was paper thin. Sure the CGI was flawless but you expect more. I found the camera work better than Bay's past films and the score great (except Linkin' Park).This is all you know when you see this film: Good robots vs. bad robots trying to find this mystical cube. If you want to watch this film for its plot and story, you'll be disappointed. Do you even think this film needs a good plot? No. It's a fun filled action film.I thought the film excluding the last forty minutes was decent. I expected more from Bay but as the last forty minutes rolled in, it gets thrilling. The action is non-stop. I liked the humor throughout the film which makes it entertaining. Shia LaBeouf plays a charismatic character and Megan Fox a sexy, but smart, girl. Others like Josh Duhamel and Jon Voight was good.Do not watch this movie expecting a great story. Watch it to be entertained with the action sequences and humor. Michael Bay isn't a grand storyteller yet but he is a professional popcorn movie director.",7,0,4,4 July 2007
Magic Mike XXL," Everyone needs some Magic Mike in their life
","Now here comes a film whose only intentions are to entertain and make people smile, and it's the purity of these intentions that makes this film such a knockout. In fact, Magic Mike XXL is so infectiously positive, only the heartless, prudish, and close-minded will be left without a smile. How refreshing it is to see a film that doesn't judge or criticize its audience and celebrates sexuality as something that one shouldn't be ashamed of. On top of that, the film makes a point about treating everyone equally and with respect, regardless of race, sex, sexuality, and size. In that regard, the film is revolutionary. For example, Jada Pinkett Smith plays a character who refers to women as 'queens' and men as 'kings.' Additionally, the climax features a dance number where Channing Tatum and Stephen Boss (aka: Twitch) mirror dance moves to their respective attendees, despite their difference in skin color. Our male comrades also find themselves vogueing in a drag show. A DRAG SHOW. If you were wondering why gay people weren't included in the first film, well, they fixed it here. Also, I had no idea what vogueing meant, but I do now.But let's not get bogged down in the subtext. Magic Mike XXL is completely different from the first film, yet it's almost as good as it, with terrific performances from everyone. The side characters from the first film are fleshed out here, with each member of the Kings of Tampa getting their chance to shine. Apart from Tatum, the most notable of the bunch is Joe Manganiello, who appears in a dance routine involving Backstreet Boys' 'I Want It That Way.' ...as you can imagine, it's one of the best scenes in the film. Oh, and you get to hear Matt Bomer sing...twice. There are also a few new castmembers, including the aforementioned Jada Pinkett Smith. She steals every single scene she's in as Rome, the feisty and commanding ringleader of her own club, as well as a past lover of Mike. On top of that, Donald Glover, Andie MacDowell, and Elizabeth Banks are very memorable in their limited roles. Literally everyone is good in it. By the time the credits rolled, I exhaled deeply with a stupid grin on my face, having gone through a joyous experience. Sure, Magic Mike XXL doesn't have that much to offer in terms of plot or stakes, but it is the most unabashedly entertaining movie of the year so far. Whether you're male or female, gay or straight, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more feel-good movie this summer.",8,6,26,1 July 2015
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Prepare to get served
","Inspired by Ron and Judi Barrett's beloved children's book of the same name, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS follows inventor Flint Lockwood and brainy weathergirl Sam Sparks as they attempt to discover why the rain in their small town has stopped while food is falling in its place. Meanwhile, lifelong bully Brent relishes in tormenting Flint just as he did when they were kids, and Mayor Shelbourne schemes to use Flint's latest invention--a device designed to improve everyone's lives--for his own personal gain.OK, I admit it. The trailer for this film looked average, compared to other animated flicks, especially the films from Pixar. I thought the film would be too kiddy for me and that the storyline was beyond lame. I mean, food falling from the sky doesn't draw people in, does it? Oh, how wrong I was. I think we just found the third contender for the best animated movie section in the Academy Awards, people! Not only is this much better than non-Pixar animated films that has been released in SOME time (I think the last was HAPPY FEET?), but it's also one of the most visceral, inventive, entertaining, ingenious, silly movies that I've seen this year! Oh, wait. This is the only one.I felt like a kid again when I put my 3D glasses on. Things popped out in a flashy fashion and the movie told in a quick pace with zippy dialogue! I wanted to grab the delicious-looking foods on the screen, from hotdogs to ice cream! It's like being a kid in a candy store! There's so much craziness here that I can't even dare to describe! When was it the first time that you saw a talking monkey that ripped a heart out from a live gummy bear?! When was it the first time that you saw a live turkey eating a human being?! Everything in this film is so ridiculous and preposterous that you have no choice but to go along with the rideThis is also a very, very funny film with a laugh per minute with some really clever jokes scattered throughout the film. But don't worry. There's a story in here too. It's been quite a while since I've seen a good father-and-son film (the last was FINDING NEMO?), but this film succeeded in that department as well. The message is by no means blatant and preachy at all. The cast is also a splendid delight, Mr. T standing out as one of the top characters because you can never really escape his noticeable voice. Bill Hader and Anna Faris did a wonderful job in their roles as well.Oh, and did I mention the film was a visual feast (no pun intended)? You will see things in here that you have NEVER seen and probably will never see again in any other film. This should automatically get you a ticket to the theaters because when are you ever going to see a talking monkey grabbing a heart out of a live gummy bear?! WHEN?! The 3D technology is near flawless. It's probably the best looking 3D I've ever seen, the image looking very sharp from background to foreground. I also found the score by Mark Mothersbaugh to be amazing and exceptionally memorable.If there's one bad thing I have to say about the movie, it isn't as good as Pixar's storytelling. However, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS should be a movie you should watch in theaters because it's unlike any movie you have ever seen. There's a lot of ingenuity and inventiveness and cleverness that is warped around the movie. The film is entertaining for both the kids and the adults to enjoy, so there's no need to worry. But wow, was this film a spectacle. If you have the chance to see this in 3D, see it but I'm sure the 2D version works just as well. If you're iffy about the trailer, I guess that's a good thing because the movie surpasses the trailer by ten times. Prepare to get served...literally.",8,50,71,19 September 2009
Million Dollar Baby," Tough Ain't Enough
","Maggie Fitzgerald, a poor thirty-one year old waitress from the very lower classes and with a dysfunctional loser family, decides to make a difference through boxing. She convinces the experienced hardened boxing trainer Frankie Dunn to coach her and be her manager, with the support of his old partner Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, who sees her potential as a boxer. Frankie has a problematical relationship with his daughter, and practically adopts Maggie along her career.Overall, this is one of the best films ever. This was the best film of 2004, which won it an Oscar for Best Picture, of course. This film is strong, powerful, dramatic, and is a total knockout! The acting by the leading trio (Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman) are all fantastic! There are some scenes that makes your stomachs turn and some scenes that make you laugh.This is a terrific film with everything you want in a good film. It has some dark and sad moments and light and comedic moments. You'll love this film if you actually want to see a good one.",9,5,8,20 March 2007

Eventually, both women are pulled into a psychotic illusion involving a dangerous blue box, a director named Adam Kesher, and the mysterious night club Silencio.Who? What? When? Where? Why? Well, those are the questions you'll ask when it ends. I'm fairly a confused person right now, knowing nothing that I've been through. I'm a simple-minded person, as you can tell so I don't know if this review will help you or not.Although very confusing, this film is a confusing, disturbing, and great film. Why great? It just makes you pay attention throughout the film because you don't know what's going on, hence you will be having a good time in this movie.Yes, and this film is also dark and disturbing. It actually might give me nightmares when I sleep. Oh, well. The acting by Laura Harring and Niomi Watts are very good.You don't want to watch this film because it might get too confusing, just watch it. I used the net to research and finally get some part of it. However, this is a great piece of work.",8,2,4,26 April 2007
Shrek 2," A Worthy Sequel!
","Right after their honeymoon the newly wed couple goes to Princess Fiona's parents for dinner. When a Fairy God Mother discovers Fiona and Shrek are married she reminds the king about a deal they agreed on years ago that Fiona should have married Prince Charming (her son). The king then hires a cat named Puss-in-Boots (a sword fighting cat and ogre slayer) to kill Shrek.The first was such a great film, this sequel obviously fell short. Of course it was unnecessary but it's still a great film! It's the best animation film of 2004, although it didn't win the Oscar. As you can see, this film is bigger, funner, and funnier!Trust me, there are more jokes in this than in any animated film. I've watched this with a full audience which laughed throughout the movie! Also, you can find some great action sequences and many spoofs to other films.There are lovable characters in this film, including the new Puss and Boots. There is a great story and moral in this film and so on in a great animation flick. Although not better than the first, it's still a great fantastic movie!",9,0,1,24 May 2007
Saw II," Bad Bad Bad Bad...
","After seeing the first movie, I was excited to see the sequel. After seeing it, I was disappointed. Really disappointed. I was expecting a lot more from it but I guess they are too scared to push the envelope.This film is about Jigsaw locking a few unlucky people in a booby trapped shelter and they must find a way out before they inhale too much of a lethal nerve gas and die. But they must watch out, for the traps Jigsaw has set in the shelter lead to death also.The beginning starts off good but it went downhill from there. The movie is weak. There are more people and more deaths but they're not good enough to make you happy. We don't care for some characters. We don't even care what happens to them. Then at the end, there's this twist. I heard the twist in IMDb before I watched this movie so maybe that's one reason I don't like this movie. Saw was such a great success that this sequel feels so sad, it shouldn't even be called a sequel.The plot is repeated for this sequel.The score for this film is great like any other Saw films. The energy and suspense from the first film did not came back for the second. It's not thrilling, suspenseful, nor scary. Fortunatley, there are moments that makes you cringe including the needle pit scene. Saw was just a great crime thriller that this must be the opposite.This is an OK movie. It's not that bad that I hate it. It was that I was expecting much more than just deaths and more people and twists. If you're a big fan of the original, this might disappoint you.",6,1,2,19 June 2006
Jurassic World," A Jurassic Park for a Modern Audience
","JURASSIC WORLD is sooooooo stupid. Every situation the characters are in is due to their stupidity or the stupidity of someone else. Remember in JURASSIC PARK​ when there were smart people who found themselves in an extraordinary situation beyond their control? Nevertheless, the fact that there were many moments where I either gasped in awe or terror is a testament to how freaking awesome dinosaurs are and how much we've missed seeing them in almost 15 years. The nostalgia is strong with this one, although some callbacks to the original film feel obvious and cloying.However, the climax is pretty damn wonderful. It's the one thing I can safely say made me feel like a kid again. Additionally, Chris Pratt is great (no surprise there). He's the best actor in here, but it's too bad the supporting characters are either expendable or aren't developed enough. Oh, well.... JURASSIC WORLD ain't no JURASSIC PARK. The CGI is apparent, and there aren't a lot of practical effects (I can count only one scene). It's a film for a modern audience, and I'm not saying that to be cynical. There's literally a scene where Bryce Dallas Howard's character says that outright. Overall, it's a dumb, fun movie for the most part. Just leave your brain at the door because you won't be using it. You'll regret it if you do.",6,3,9,12 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," Don't See It Alone
","Katie and Micah are a couple who've just moved into a new home. Katie believes that malevolent spirits have been following her since childhood, though Micah is not so easily convinced. However, after several nights of loud noises and strange happenings, Micah starts to agree with Katie that some sort of ghost may have followed them to the new home. Micah decides to take control of the situation and sets up a battery of video cameras so that if a spirit manifests itself, he can capture its behavior on tape.PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a small, little horror movie that is getting a lot of buzz lately similar to BLAIR WITCH ten years ago. Let me start off by saying to not keep your expectations as high as the hype because the hype makes the film out to be the scariest film in the last decade and even the scariest film of all time, which is really ridiculous. Setting your standards based on the hype does the movie injustice. However, saying that, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY IS a good, scary film, which we rarely see in Hollywood these days. Oh, wait. This was PICKED UP by Hollywood. My mistake. Like BLAIR WITCH, the film starts off as if everything is fine which makes the scary scenes much more terrifying.Hitchcock once said that suspense is the ANTICIPATION leading up to the explosion of a ticking time bomb and the scare is the bomb explosion itself. The former part of that statement describes PARANORMAL ACTIVITY perfectly. Like BLAIR WITCH, the film is all about the build up of fear, starting off very subtle but slowly escalating as the story progresses and by the end, you're almost killed by the tension! No, the movie doesn't rely on cheap gore effects, gratuitous violence, or useless nudity. No, it doesn't rely on CGI or make-up effects. It relies heavily on your sense of imagination, which, ultimately, is the cause of your own fear.The film also has a real authenticity feel to it, especially the exchange between with actors Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat, whom both pull off very fine and realistic performances. Oh, and when you go home after the movie is finished, and when you get in your bed to sleep at night, good luck with that. This film not only makes you afraid of your own home, it effectively strips the securities of where you're suppose to feel the safest in the entire world the most: In your bedroom. A movie that makes you feel this vulnerable probably makes you want to see more of these films...or maybe less.However, if there's one thing I don't like about the film, it's the ending. The movie builds up so well that the ending ends up feeling very abrupt and so very disappointing because it almost comes out of nowhere. There was no catharsis. But other than that, the film is scary. I'm already starting to feel the after-effects. If a film can manage to scare you and the audience with creaks from a door and footsteps coming from another room, you know the film succeeded. See the movie because I'd rather see an inventive, clever movie like this do well than SAW 57...oh, AND because it's scary.",8,2,7,10 October 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Burton and Depp... Again?!
","Burton and Depp team up for the umpteenth time for a new remake: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This film is about a young boy wins a tour through the most magnificent chocolate factory in the world, led by the world's most unusual candy maker.This film is weird and eye popping. The sets are amazing. The songs in the film are entertaining. The special effects are great. Almost everything in this film is great. One problem is Johnny Depps character, Willy Wonka. He looks like Michael Jackson! Now that's wrong. In my opinion, this film is better than the original. Willy Wonka is crazy. He is funny. He makes funny lines that makes you laugh. This film is just freaky. It'll freak your freak. This type of Willy Wonka is not nice and sweet as the original was but this type is just parent hating.The main character is what we all want to be, or at least I want to be. The other children has some flaws including snobby, spoiled, fat, and a game freak. Some parts of this movie is really different than the original. This film is great for all ages. It's just entertaining as the original. Go see it.",7,0,3,23 December 2005
Mission: Impossible II," A Kenetic Thrill Adventure!
","IMF agent Ethan Hunt has been sent on a mission to retrieve and destroy the supply of a genetically created disease called 'Chimera'. His mission is made impossible due to the fact that he is not the only person after samples of the disease. He must also contest with a gang of international terrorists headed by a turned bad former IMF agent who has already managed to steal the cure called 'Bellerophon' and now need 'Chimera' to complete their grand plan of infecting the whole world. In order to infiltrate and locate the terrorist group he relies on the help of an international thief Nyah of whom he quickly develops a love interest. Time is not only running out for Agent Hunt to find and destroy 'Chimera' before the terrorists get their hands on it.Wow, I have finally finished the Mission Impossible trilogies. Starting with the third and ending with the second. Weird, isn't it? Now getting that out of the way, there's another problem: I've seen the last thirty minutes on television without watching the whole movie. Yeah, I think watching the ending and watching the third movie before the rest would affect how I would like this film.Still, I liked the film. Well, it is as good as the first if not better than the first. Fortunately, the plot is easier to understand in here and there are tons more action sequences. I really can't stop saying it. This is a truly an exhilarating action/spy film and it's a worthy sequel. Yeah, I knew what was going to happen before they were going to happen because I've seen parts of it before but this was still an entertaining movie for me.I got annoyed with this one problem though: It's when characters take their masks off revealing another character. Each film has this kind of scene but they kind of overdo it in this one. Another is with Ving Rhames just caring about his shoes and tuxedo whenever people make a scratch on them. I also didn't think that Thandie Newton was a good love interest for Tom Cruise. But to say for their performances, they were good.The cinematography was really well done and the score was really relaxing. This felt like a laid back film. It wasn't all too serious and had some humor in it and you can't deny you wouldn't expect some clichés and cheesy one liners in here. The locations in the film was also very beautiful. The action sequences were amazing and thrilling.I can say this film was as good as the first film and has great action sequences. It's a perfect popcorn movie for those who haven't seen it yet and it's entertaining, although it isn't as close as the first or third Mission Impossible films.

","On the brink of winning a seat in the U.S. Senate, ambitious politician David Norris meets beautiful contemporary ballet dancer Elise Sellas, a woman like none he's ever known. But just as he realizes he's falling for her, mysterious men conspire to keep the two apart. David learns he is up against the agents of Fate itself--the men of The Adjustment Bureau--who will do everything in their considerable power to prevent David and Elise from being together. In the face of overwhelming odds, he must either let her go and accept a predetermined path...or risk everything to defy Fate and be with her.TAB is a great example of a film with an intriguing storyline (aren't most of Philip K. Dick's material usually are?) which is executed in a mediocre way, and I stress that word to the fullest extent. While watching TAB, I felt very indifferent throughout. There were some random, decent chase scenes here and there and the film has a lot of surprisingly funny scenes, but I never really cared for the characters. I was never really involved with their situation. I just didn't care, and that made my viewing experience a bit exhausting to get through.First and foremost, the weakest thing about the film is the plot. It's so flimsy, thin, and predictable that you really don't need a feature length film to tell it. After an hour in, the film begins to spin its wheels. It goes on and on and on and the chase scenes (which seem to be added just for the hell of it) get really repetitive. From the third act on, it's just a huge mess. On top of that, the ending is lame as hell. It is probably the definition of deus ex machina. It felt really tacked on which is ironic since it seemed that the reason the film was pushed back from 2010 to a 2011 release was because they had to reshoot the ending. So much for that.The characters weren't really developed either, even though the talented Matt Damon and Emily Blunt tried their best to elevate the mediocre script. If anything, they saved the film from being a totally forgettable film than it already is. I thought John Slattery added some well needed humor throughout the film, which I didn't expect at all. I really liked his character. On a technical standpoint, it's a mixed bag. The good was the awesome scenery of New York. The bad was the camera focus itself. It felt like the cinematographer had no idea what he was doing. Doubt me? Watch the film and you can see MANY blurry scenes throughout. Talk about a rushed production.Overall, TAB had huge potential. The story was very interesting to me, although it did remind me a lot of DARK CITY (a much better and effective film, in my opinion). The actors seriously try their best but even they couldn't save the film. As a huge sci-fi fan, I was severely disappointed by it. If you're intrigued, just wait for it on DVD and rent it instead or watch DARK CITY...or even read Philip K. Dick's original short story itself.",5,6,14,1 March 2011
Avengers: Age of Ultron," In Whedon, without the Studio Controlling Him, We Trust
","Watching AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON can be summed up with the following words: entertaining, exhausting, and overstuffed. It's also one of the few summer action blockbusters that feels like it could have been better without all those incomprehensible, *forced* action scenes, in which the quiet character scenes between them are so much more memorable and interesting. With the numerous characters, even more so than the first, it's a miracle, then, that director Joss Whedon somehow manages to make the sequel coherent, balanced, and well paced. In the hands of a lesser director, the film could have been a disaster in more ways than one. Still, you can't help but feel Whedon going off a check list to satisfy fans of these superheroes, preventing the film to reach its potential (see: the cliffhanger ending setting up the inevitable sequel). Whedon takes some risks with this one, but overall, he plays it safe.",6,5,12,2 May 2015
The Dark Knight," Why So Serious?
","Batman raises the stakes in his war on crime. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal organizations that plague the city streets. The partnership proves to be effective, but they soon find themselves prey to a reign of chaos unleashed by a rising criminal mastermind known to the terrified citizens of Gotham as The Joker.If you read my review for 'Journey to the Center of the Earth,' you should know that I didn't get to see 'The Dark Knight' on IMAX the week it was released. This week, I was lucky enough to buy tickets to see the last screening for this film on IMAX for the day I decided to see it, because every other showings were, guess what, sold out.There's no surprise here. I loved the movie. You knew it would be brilliant. I knew it would be brilliant. We all knew it would be brilliant. I can say that it's one of the best films this year but you should already know that so let's move away from that aspect of the film.What surprised me here was that this film was much more than a superhero movie. It's just not evil versus good. There are several underlying themes in here, which would make anyone go crazy in their minds. This is really a disturbing movie. So disturbing that one more push on the PG-13 rating would turn this film to an R-rated film. I was going a little crazy in my head.The action sequences were impressive enough, as well as the visual, design, and make-up effects. The score is fantastic, much coming over from the first film. Now, the performances. We all know who we should talk about: The late Heath Ledger. As The Joker, I obviously think he's better than Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the character, but pretty much because I was so bored with the original Batman movie.But here's the question some people are raising up: If Heath Ledger didn't die, would people even care about Ledger's performance in the film? Did this event somehow affect the rest of the movie? Possibly, but please, I really think Ledger should deserve an Oscar nomination for his performance in here. The other two newbies in this movie, Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal, are really terrific in their roles as well.If you get a chance to do so, try to watch this film on IMAX. No, I don't think it'll change your opinion on the movie if you see this on a bigger screen but I think it's just a better movie experience for this type of film. Not only is this the movie to watch this summer, this is the movie to watch this year. However, I should warn you that little kids may be scared but it depends on the parents, I guess. Yes, I do think it's one of the best films of this year and yes, this is the best Batman film ever created.",10,5,12,28 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The Rebellion Begins
","As another year begins for Harry, at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry so does the never-ending articles stating that he and Dumbledore are insane. As the ministry starts to invent new and malicious lies about Harry's account on Voldemort's return, Hogwarts begins to change for the worse as the ministry sends in their cure for all the insanity, Professor Dolores Jane Umbridge. As she begins to inflict her rules and regulations on the students at Hogwarts they begin to find that with her as their teacher, they'll never be ready for the outside world.So Harry along with his friends decides to take things into their own hands and begin to learn magic the real way. As Harry starts having visions of terrible events happening with the Ministries very walls he decides to take action, leading himself and his friends into battle, ultimately teaching them what friendship, loyalty and sacrifice really means.You know how crazy the trailer and TV spots are, showing all the good parts in the film? Yeah, that got me very excited for the film. I set a very high expectation for this film. Maybe a little bit too high. With each film getting better and better by each entry, this one is the worse, by far, although it is still a great film.Maybe the mistake is a new writer (Michael Goldenberg)? Or maybe the film is too short? Ironically, this is the longest book in the series but the shortest running time. I felt that the movie was rushed, trying to fit everything in the short 2 hour and 10 minutes it has. The editing is very noticeable.With that being said, this movie goes straight to the point, like Fantastic Four 2, which is encouraging for people who haven't read the films and discouraging for fans of Harry Potter. Yeah, it talks more of the plot but most of the fun in the previous four films are taken out and more depressing things are added in.Why can't they have made it a three hour movie? I'm sure people don't mind it. For a person who have read the books, they have cut out many important elements. Another bad thing from the running time is the short appearances made by brilliant cast members. For example, blink and Sybil Trelawney (wonderfully played by Emma Thompson) might be gone. Same goes for Alan Rickman's performance on Snape.No doubt this film might be liked by some and disliked by others and that the film is the darkest and most visaulistic yet. The visual effects are even better and seamless. The action sequences, less in this film, are good but not better than the last film. The music, although different, isn't up to par with the previous films.I like the new look of the film. Obviously, each director has their own perspective on the world of Harry Potter and I would love to see another director making another new look for this series. It's refreshing and not repetitive.The main three cast members have grown mature over their roles, most notably Daniel Radcliffe, who gives a great performance. Another person who gives a brilliant performance is Imelda Staunton. She is the perfect role for Dolores Umbridge! And how about the kissing scene? Well, just watch the movie for yourself.Although not the best movie in the series, it is certainly a worthy sequel. The film is magical. The look of it is great. If you're a fan, you might be disappointed or you might like it. For an average movie goer, you'll notice nothing and that's probably the reason you'll love it.",9,1,3,14 July 2007
Blood Diamond," An Excellent Film!
","A story following Archer, a man tortured by his roots. With a strong survival instinct, he has made himself a key player in the business of conflict diamonds. Political unrest is rampant in Sierra Leone as people fight tooth for tooth. Upon meeting Solomon, and the beautiful Maddy, Archer's life changes forever as he is given a chance to make peace with the war around him.I liked this film a lot. It is somewhat similar to Hotel Rwanda which shows us an even that happened that we weren't aware of. This shows us where we get our diamonds. What we don't know is that people actually try to kill themselves to find these rare diamonds.There are many moments you will find very wrong. This film shows us the truth and is very emotional, if you're that kind of person. The acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou are really Oscar worthy giving superb performances while Jennifer Connelly was just good. I loved the scenery in the film. The whole view is wonderful, filled with spectacle.I really don't know what else to say about this film but it's one of the best in 2006 and it's truly heart breaking to try to sit through some violent scenes. This movie is not for children and I'm glad it doesn't have a complicated plot to follow. Watch it if you really like good films.",8,0,1,21 May 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Probably the Best Romantic Film!
","On a Valentine Day, Joel Barish feels the impulse of going to Montauk instead of working. After spending the cold day on the beach, he meets Clementine Kruczynski on the train station and they have a crush on each other. Joel and Clementine do not know that they were mates in the past. Joel has just erased Clementine from his memories when he found that Clementine did exactly the same, when their relationship ended. However, along his erasing process, Joel becomes astonished when he finds that he still loves Clementine and he does not want to lose her, fighting for keeping the memories of their moments together instead.This is a movie that makes you think and could break your heart at the same time. It's your different kind of romantic comedy and it's a great addition to Charlie Kaufman's writing. The great work of CGI and camera work draws in the viewers because they are so amazing! The acting by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are really fantastic. I never have anything to say about great films like this. It has an emotional core and one of the best films ever made.",10,3,6,6 June 2007
Taken," The time for revenge has come.
","Bryan Mills, a retired CIA operative, needs to set about tracking down his teenage daughter, Kim, after she and her friend are kidnapped by slave traders while traveling in Paris.I must say now: This is an audience pleaser. The chances an average movie goer like you is going to not like this movie is very slim. With a mix of the Jason Bourne movies, 'Casino Royale,' and 'Live Free or Die Hard,' I found it entertaining as hell and the first kinetic, fantastic action movie this year. Who would've known Liam Neeson could play an action hero at this age?The movie starts off really well. I almost teared up seeing the authentic father/daughter relationship. I'm just a sucker for those things. Minutes later, the action starts and the action in here is a little above par but not as good as you would think. The car chases aren't that great but overall, they're mindless enough for you not to care. Some scenes are just brutal, though, and one might think how this movie got away with a PG-13 rating.Liam Neeson, as said earlier, does a great job as the next Jason Bourne looking for revenge. The directing job is pretty good too, along with the editing. Overall, there's nothing else to say. Will it entertain you? Hell, yes. Is this an amazing film? No, but it shouldn't matter.",7,0,0,14 February 2009
Alice in Wonderland," You've got a very important date
","Alice returns to the whimsical world she first encountered as a young girl, reuniting with her childhood friends: the White Rabbit, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Dormouse, the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, and of course, the Mad Hatter. Alice embarks on a fantastical journey to find her true destiny and end the Red Queen's reign of terror.I haven't read the original book or have seen one single adaptation so I didn't know what to expect when walking into this film other than the fact that it has the trio who always stick together: Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter. By the end of the film, I was blown away by the imagery of the story, although not the story itself. I went to see this film in 3D, and I'm glad to say it was perfectly suitable for the film.The use of this technology was similar to AVATAR in that it used the 3D to enhance the storytelling experience rather than throw things at the audience every five minutes. Another thing I enjoyed is the visual treat. Once Alice goes to Wonderland, we get to see a lot of jaw-dropping images that do not let up. It's, literally, one great imagery after another after another after another. You can tell the people working on this film worked their butts off for this and it really paid off. The story, however, didn't match to the high standards of the visuals. It was interesting in some ways but the film does meander a lot in the middle of the film. Still, by the end, I enjoyed it overall.Another thing I enjoyed a lot is the characters, particularly Alice, the Red Queen and the Cheshire Cat. Most of the characters are really sweet. The performance by newcomer Mia Wasikowska is really good. There is this aura around her that lightens up the screen every time she's on. Johnny Depp is weird at first, but it's mostly kinda boring. I didn't find him interesting as much as the other colorful characters in here. However, I did love Helena Bonham Carter and her 'Off with their heads!' line that seem to plague 90% of her dialogue. I also loved Anne Hathaway as well. Some may find her performance overreaching but I think it's appropriate to the weirdness of the film. And it's always great to see Crispin Glover in a weird role.The voice work is as good as the live actors, if not better. Michael Sheen as the White Rabbit works really well along with the noticeable Alan Rickman voicing the Blue Caterpillar. Barbara Windsor gives us a cute and cuddly character as the Dormouse. Oh, and the more we say less about Paul Whitehouse as the March Hare, the better. I found his character to be disturbing to say the least.The movie could have fallen to the 'all style but no substance' category if it weren't for the great characters and the unique approach given by Tim Burton and his wonderful, yet odd, visual style. The film is humorous at times that I chuckled quite a bit throughout the film and heartfelt at times. Sure, some people would criticize the film for being uninteresting and underwhelming as compared to the visual style but I think it's good enough in my book. Watch the film in 3D or in IMAX 3D if you have the chance because it's really worth the money to bring yourself in a magical world filled with wonder.",7,1,1,16 March 2010
Avatar," I See You
","An ex-Marine finds himself thrust into hostilities on an alien planet filled with exotic life forms. As an Avatar, a human mind in an alien body, he finds himself torn between two worlds, in a desperate fight for his own survival and that of the indigenous people.I'm a huge fan of James Cameron. The best film ever created is TITANIC, in my opinion. I'm not afraid to admit it. It should be no surprise that I absolutely loved AVATAR after walking out of the screening room. Now, did I walk in with a certain bias toward the film? Probably, yes, I would say. However, to be fair, the film surpassed the hype which made it out to be a revolutionary film that will change the course of film making of all mankind. And I will say this now: This revolutionary film will change the course of film making of all mankind.What makes this movie so revolutionary is that it sets a standard for 3D movies, and a high one at that. It not only puts the 3D to good use, in a way it contributes to the overall story than having things pop out every five seconds, but it is also successful at integrating motion capture with live performances in a way where it blows every previous films faulty attempts away. The technology is that good. Trust me. Technically, the film should be able to win every award dealing with it because, let's be honest, Cameron knows how to tell a broad story, especially in this size and scope.But what about the story? I've been rambling about how good the technology and the effects are, considering it has a budget of around $275 million. The story is sometimes predictable and clichÃ©d. If anything, people usually commend Cameron's ability to tell a story on screen but don't put his screen writing skills as high as a place as that and I see why people would say that. There are many films this movie borrowed from, but you know what? I don't care. Every film is, in some degree, predictable, and I believe this and the earnestness to tell and end the story in a way that has been done before is what adds to the wondrous quality of the film.When I saw Sam Worthington in TERMINATOR: SALVATION, which came out earlier this year, I didn't appreciate his performance like many people did. However, in this film, I think he did a great job as the thick-minded character. Sigourney Weaver is in a role that is actually perfect for her but I'd assume Cameron wrote the part specifically for her, but I think she's great she's in a film that is good for her because her last few roles in the past few years have been very 'eh.' Zoe Saldana, I must say, did an excellent job as Worthington's love interest. She has this magnificent talent where you believe and feel every word she speaks.Stephen Lang plays a fantastic villain role, albeit a predictable and one-dimensional one. It's a character we all love to hate. Another character like that is played by Giovanni Ribisi, playing the 'captain' who will never understand all the bad decisions he makes. Other actors I'd like to mention in this excessive cast are Michelle Rodriguez, Joel Moore, and CCH Pounder. For a film that is over 2 hours and 30 minutes long, the film doesn't have a dull nor slow moment, probably because a story this big should have this long a running time in order to tell it. The soundtrack by James Horner is magical but by no means one of the best ever.I found the film to be not only a huge spectacle but also a film with a story that is not so white and black and with characters you believe and root for. It also deals with some relevant, moral issues. It's entertaining, spellbinding, and a magical experience in 3D. Rarely have I ever found myself so entranced by a movie. AVATAR is the best movie of this year. See the movie in 3D not because it's better or cooler but because it's necessary. See it now. Run, don't walk, to your nearest theater. This is a movie you should see before you die.",9,12,20,26 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Sam Raimi Back to the Basics
","Christine Brown is an ambitious L.A. loan officer with a charming boyfriend, professor Clay Dalton. Life is good until the mysterious Mrs. Ganush arrives at the bank to beg for an extension on her home loan. Should Christine follow her instincts and give the old woman a break or should she deny the extension to impress her boss, Mr. Jacks, and get a leg-up on a promotion? Christine fatefully chooses the latter, shaming Mrs. Ganush and dispossessing her of her home. In retaliation, the old woman places the powerful curse of the Lamia on Christine, transforming her life into a living hell.Director Sam Raimi returns to the horror genre in which he was known famous for. Like the previous 'Evil Dead' films, DMTH is not a serious horror film. One can tell from Universal's very old logo during the first few seconds of the film that it's going to be a B-movie. While it does have its scary scenes, there is a nice balance of horror and comedy here. This is a breath of fresh air, considering many horror movies these days take themselves too seriously that they get laughed for the wrong reasons or that they try to be funny but fail miserably and get laughed for the wrong reasons. Either way, they both get laughed at for the wrong reasons.If you're jumping out of your skins in the first five minutes of the film, you'll know you're in for a ride. What makes the suspense, scares, and tension in here so effective, as opposed to other horror film, is the use of noise and sound effects. Raimi uses everyday household sound effects to scare us, and they actually work! And yes, this film is scary. The make-up for Mrs. Ganush is very creepy. The score by Christopher Young is also really refreshing, because it's quite original.For the humorous side of the film, it's really a horror-comedy. The gross-out visuals are disgusting, but you laugh at them anyway because of how outrageous and exaggerated they are. Actually, the whole flick is kind of outrageous, isn't it? This is what makes the film very fun to watch. You jump out of your seat but you laugh it off. This film really does bring the audience in for the ride. For example, there is one scene in which a fly flies to the camera screen, breaking the fourth wall.The performance by Alison Lohman is really fun to watch. You see her character change from someone innocent to...well, you'll see. Justin Long does decently for what he's given, although it's not that much. Lorna Raver steals the show playing the devilish Mrs. Ganush. However, saying all of this, I can't help but say that I was a bit disappointed in the film overall. Some of the jokes in here are really random and bland. Some of the pop up scenes do get tiring after awhile. Overall, it's a pretty good horror-comedy. The film promises scares and laughs and that's what it gives.",6,0,2,30 May 2009
Grindhouse," Two Great Films, Each With Their Own Creativity!
","First off, you're waiting to see this movie. The first thing to come up is the fake trailer 'Machete', directed by Robert Rodriguez. For me, if this was a real film, I won't watch it. It looks okay. It's really nothing special about an illegal alien killing people. There are some funny moments in the trailer, along with nudity, blood, and violence. This also starts off the 'stratchy' and 'old look' feel of the entire film.Next, comes 'Planet Terror', directed by Robert Rodriguez, one of the two feature length films in this one film. It's about a world getting terrorized by zombies with what you can find like extreme violence, some bloody action, and all.This film, as a zombie film, is one of the best in history. I liked it better than Dawn of the Dead (probably not the original or Shaun of the Dead, though). In this film, you would meet a Go-Go dancer, Cherry, Wray, her boyfriend(?), Dr. Dakota Block and her husband Dr. William Block, and MANY others that will be joining the splatter.There are many gross-out moments in this film. You'll find something more than what's in your ordinary zombie film and you'll find some shocking moments, too.The acting by Rose McGowan is probably the best in this film along with Freddy Rodríguez. Yes, you can also expect funny moments in the film and a sex scene.If you like zombie films, you'll love this particular well-made zombie film with a lot of gore, violence, and some sex and nudity to fit it all together. I'm giving this film a 10/10.After that film, you'll have three more fake trailers: The second fake trailer is called 'Werewolf Women of the S.S.', directed by Rob Zombie. This one, I would probably not watch if it was made into a real film, but it is funny, especially a cameo by Nicolas Cage, which was funny.The third fake trailer you'll find is the very funny 'Thanksgiving', directed by Eli Roth who gives a cameo. I'm not an Eli Roth fan, per se, but I would watch this film. You'll find very funny dialog with a cringing scene. You can tell you'll have fun watching this entire trailer. This is the best trailer in this whole film.The fourth and last fake trailer is simply called 'Don't', directed by Edgar Wright. Nick Frost gives a cameo appearance. This trailer is basically about almost all the clichés in a horror film like 'Don't look behind that door' or 'Don't scream for help', which is why it's so funny.After that intermission, you'll find yourself watching 'Death Proof', the second of two feature length films you'll see. This film is about a man, given the name Stuntman Mike, because he's a stuntman and his name is Mike, who picks out random girls and kills them by his 'death proof' car, as he says. But his next victims are actually fighting back! I wonder why...In this film, you'll find more talking than car chases or any action sequence. If you want to see them, you'll have to wait at the end to actually see them but first, you'll have to hear people talk for most of the film.That's not a bad thing because Quentin Tarantino is really good at writing dialog, so you'll be interested with the conversations in the film, rather than get bored. There are some scenes that are rather gory and violent but most of the film is funny.After the witty dialog between some people, you'll see the 'best car chase in movie history', or at least the TV spot says. Let me sum this best car chase thing up: It ain't the best car chase ever. I find others like the one in 'The Island' much more thrilling than this one. But I must say that scene was suspenseful so it probably may be 'the best car chase sequence that is real', meaning no CGI.Here, you'll find Kurt Russell's and Tracie Thoms's performances funny and the others were just mediocre. One thing people might be disappointed in is that this film is mostly crisp clean, meaning it doesn't have as many scratches and old look as 'Planet Terror'.If you are thinking this film will be filled with intense car chase sequences, you'll be disappointed but if you know how Tarantino does his movies, you'll like this one, maybe even better than 'Planet Terror'. I'll give this movie a 9/10. I find 'Planet Terror' much more entertaining.Overall, I'll give this movie a 9/10, which is worth the three hours and payment for the movie. You'll get more with the price of one because this is one good piece!",10,1,6,7 April 2007
Mission: Impossible," A Solid Confusing Thriller
","Jim Phelps and his team charged with stopping a traitor from stealing and selling classified material. Everything was going well until the man they are following and all of the team are inexplicably killed except for Ethan Hunt. Ethan then calls the Director and goes to meet him when he discovers that the whole mission was to ferret a mole that they have been suspicious of for some time. Since Ethan is alive, the Director suspects him of being the mole. Now Ethan must discover and expose the real spy without the help of his organization.I had to see this movie twice because the first time was very confusing, with a complicated plot so I had to watch a second time to understand the whole movie. This film is very smart and has some twists that may leave you surprise.There are memorable sequences in the film, including Tom Cruise breaking into the CIA via the roof. It has great tension and suspense. This movie all leads to the great explosive ending with great special effects. Tom Cruise's and Emmanuelle Béart's acting are very good.Although not as exciting and good as the third film, this is a smart thriller in which average movie goers might get confused during the movie but this is a solid thriller and it is entertaining.",6,0,1,4 March 2007
Saw," A Great Thriller!
","There are two plots of this movie: One is that two people stuck in a bathroom and must find a way out by clues a person named Jigsaw has given them. Between them is a dead man and they are locked by the ankle on a pipe.The other is a detective, who is looking for Jigsaw who is the kidnapper of the two men. He's looking for him because he killed his partner, Sing, who died when both were looking for him when a bullet shot him through the head.This is a unique film. The killer's motive is interesting. He puts people up in situation which they can die if they fail or which they can live. After seeing Se7en before Saw, I see why this is like Saw. Jigsaw locks people who are unworthy and if they pass their task, he'll know they'll care about their lives instead of using them for something sinister.This film is really not a horror film but more like a crime thriller. For those who don't want to see it because they think it's scary, it's not because it's no even a horror. Well, the acting is kinda good as for their first rehearsal during the shoot of the movie. During the movie, we see part of the face of the killer. I ask why would they show it to us since they don't want us to know who the killer is? The question will be answer at the end of the film where the huge twist occurs.This film is entertaining and ingenious. It's clever, like Se7en, but really better than Se7en. I was disappointed in Se7en but this movie is Saw and not Se7en so I'll say nothing about that. Go see Saw!",6,0,1,23 December 2005
Super 8," Next Summer, It Arrives.
","Unlike many recent movie trailers where the marketers think it's a fantastic idea to spoil 97.6% of a film in its trailer, SUPER 8's marketing has been really old school. The trailers have been really mysterious, relying on intrigue to get the movie goers' butts in the theater seats, which help both the cases of the film and the movie goers because SUPER 8 is one of those films where you want to see it with knowing as little information about the film as possible. The mystery is what makes viewing SUPER 8 fun and exciting. And I have to say, SUPER 8 is one of the most joyous experiences I've ever had in a theater! THIS is how you make a great summer film.Saying that, what distinguishes SUPER 8 from most summer blockbusters (or contemporary films altogether) is this: The film tells a story in which we care for the characters in it. Sure, you can have explosions exploding every minute and add as many car chases as you want, but it's nothing if the audience doesn't care for the characters trying to survive or succeed their goal by the end of the film. I mean, that's what distinguishes good films from bad films, isn't it? The film is also masterfully told by director JJ Abrams revealing bits and pieces of the mystery at a time until the third act in which all is solved. And to top it off, the film also has pitch perfect pacing. Oh, and let's not forget about Michael Giacchino's excellent score. He really doesn't disappoint us here.While watching SUPER 8, one gets the feeling of many early Steven Spielberg 1980s classics. This is no coincidence seeing that JJ Abrams wanted to make a film as a homage of all the films he loved seeing when he was a kid, which may include ET, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and STAND BY ME. And no, SUPER 8 doesn't reek of overly affection of the films that homage evolves to blatant copying. They're noticeable but subtle enough that they aren't a distraction. Abram's affection for these films also bring a sense of nostalgia ('the good ol' days') and innocence, which is enhanced by having kids be the focus of the film. There's something genuine and heartfelt about SUPER 8 that many other films don't have, and it's Abram's love for filmmaking that makes SUPER 8 feel really human.It's obvious when I say that the young actors did a terrific job in here. Every single one of them were wisely chosen, including the film's protagonist, played by Joel Courtney. Even though this is his first film, you wouldn't think that when you see SUPER 8. He's perfectly casted, providing emotional depth to his character, and he's capable of carrying the film on his shoulders. There's also Elle Fanning, the sister of the more well known Dakota Fanning, and she acts well alongside Courtney. Ryan Lee is a scene stealer, providing some of the film's biggest laughs. And yes, there are a lot of laughs in the film. Riley Griffiths is also up to the task, with SUPER 8 also being his first film. The last two kids in the group, Gabriel Basso and Zach Mills, aren't as prominent, but they're just as good as the rest of the gang. Kyle Chandler, one of the very few adult actors that has some screen time, is pretty good as well.Overall, SUPER 8 provides an ORIGINAL(!!) emotional story, great performances by the young actors, an exciting sense of adventure, and exhilarating action scenes, resulting in one of the best feelings I've had in a movie theater and one of the best films I've ever seen. Director JJ Abrams has done it again, giving people another reason why he's one of the best new directors to look out for. EVERYONE should go out and watch SUPER 8 if you like great films. Also, stay during the end credits for a great surprise. 9.5/10",8,5,12,11 June 2011
Up," UP Soars to New Heights!
","Carl and Ellie meet and discover they both have the same dream of becoming explorers. They see newsreels of a daring adventurer named Charles Muntz, who is accused of faking a discovery of an animal unknown to man. He goes back to Venezuela, vowing to bring back the creature he claims he saw. Nothing is heard from him in years. Carl and Ellie grow up and marry. They buy an old house and fix it up. The two save up their money to go to Paradise Falls, but end up using the money for problems in life. It's present day and Ellie has died.This is all told in a beautiful but heart-wrenching montage that will make any human tear up. It's one of the best montage I've ever seen. However, the film focuses of Carl after the death of his wife. He is a recluse. After a problem has occurred, Carl decides to go to Venezuela, as a promise to Ellie. However, he's stuck with an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell. Together, they embark in an adventure to a lost world, all brought to you by Pixar.Saying that 'Up' is (yet) another masterpiece from Pixar is getting clichéd by now. At this point, Pixar can do no wrong. What they have done in the past several years was bringing films for all ages to enjoy. 'Up' is the reason why people go see movies in the first place. Compared to other animated films, 'Up' doesn't have innuendos for the older audiences. That's because it doesn't need to. This film is fantastic for all ages, the story appealing to many more people than the last two Pixar films.The rich story in 'Up' may might as well be the most realistic from Pixar yet. It's poignantly told and there are things in life that are shown here that have never been shown in other animated films before. The characters are lovable and charming and are painfully and surprisingly authentic (well, except for the talking dogs, of course). The odd relationship between Carl and Russell grows as the film progresses. For the first time, the adult is smarter than the child. The film is also undeniably endearing. The film is so endearing, in fact, that you'll cry or choke up in at least three or four different spots in the film.I didn't see this film in 3D but I can tell you the film works well with or without the extra dimension aspect. The whole look of the film is just wonderful. The colors are exuberant and lively. The animation is pitch perfect. The story is nearly flawless, with some minor problems, including some talking dogs. The score by Michael Giacchino is sweet and lovely. The directing by both Pete Docter and Bob Peterson is really great. Wow, it seemed like every shot of the film moved the story along. Some scenes were hilarious too, filled with witty dialogue. The action sequences were impeccably crafted, I'll admit, including an excellent shot in the very first one.Overall, what I loved best about this movie are the characters and the story, the two most important aspects to any movie, in fact. The entire film just hits all of the right notes. With films being released these days, it's fantastic to see movies like 'Up' are being released every once in awhile. I loved every minute of 'Up' and I assure you will too. It's no surprise for me to say that 'Up' is the best film of this year but I find it hard another film may be better than it.",10,5,11,12 June 2009
Groundhog Day," A Pretty Funny Film
","A weatherman finds himself living the same day, Groundhog Day, over and over again and tries to figure out what he has to do to live tomorrow.This film is overall pretty funny with its smart and clever jokes and some dark humor. This film is also a great romantic comedy between Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. I also like the fantasy feel with the time revolving plot.One thing I find tireless in the film is of the day going over and over again. You would like it the first couple of times but it gets really tiring. I actually wanted the days to stop going over and over again. It felt like a three hour film.The acting by Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell are great, having great chemistry. Chris Elliott's performance is pretty funny.If you like fantasy comedic romance, with some great scenes and presents a great moral of the story, you'll like this film as much as me but probably get tired of the repeating days.",7,0,4,13 March 2007
National Treasure," A Fantastic Action Adventure!
","Benjamin Franklin Gates descends from a family of treasure-seekers who've all hunted for the same thing: a war chest hidden by the Founding Fathers after the Revolutionary War. Ben's close to discovering its whereabouts, as is his competition, but the FBI is also hip to the hunt.This film is the definition of entertainment: Although with a ridiculous plot similar to 'The Da Vinci Code', I found the movie really entertaining and a really great film! There are a few action scenes but the scenes that take their place are interesting. It doesn't bore you for a two hour movie. I found myself in pure excitement throughout the movie.I also find this movie a lot less boring than the Pirates of the Caribbean films. At least it gives you some interesting historical facts. I also find the score really good! It feels thrilling and a great use for an action film. The action sequences (although not many) are done fantastically. They were thrilling and suspenseful.Nicolas Cage's performances is good. Diane Kruger's performance is nice and sexy and Justin Bartha was the comic relief of the film. In my opinion, he's my favorite character. The CGI in the film was also very well done. I don't like the fact that people didn't like this film because the plot is ludicrous. Don't mind it if you're watching this film. It's for entertainment purposes.If you would like to see a great action adventure without minding the ludicrous plot, you'll like it! It has great characters, action scenes, and interesting historical facts (you will learn something new). It's fun throughout, even for a two hour movie.",8,0,2,28 June 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Very Overrated
","A gang of thieves carry out an armed robbery on a Diamond warehouse. The police are after them so quickly that they suspect they have a rat in their company. This film starts right after the robbery, with flashbacks to before the robbery, and to the planning of the crime.After reading this plot, you know this is not your average crime film. In fact, I thought this film was about the whole diamond heist and that there will be a twist ending on who's the rat. It's absolutely nothing like that.Although an original way to make this film, this film is mostly boring, with an exception on the prologue of the film which I found entertaining for some reason. This film is very violent and bloody with shooting here and there and yelling about this and that. That's about it with the film.There's nothing interesting with the 'boring' characters and 'bad' story. The actings were relatively decent and this film is nowhere near one of the best films ever, although many people said it was, which lead me to buy the film on DVD, which I found a complete waste of money. One good thing about this film is that it's unpredictable and has funny jokes, which in real life would be just the opposite.This film is decent but not a very good film. It has some originality and clever humor but all squished with a boring plot and uninteresting characters. This is just my opinion but I should say for those who want to see this film should rent it first before buying.",7,47,75,3 February 2007
How to Train Your Dragon," A Must See in 3D!
","Set in the mythical world of burly Vikings and wild dragons, and based on the book by Cressida Cowell, the film tells the story of Hiccup, a Viking teenager who doesn't exactly fit in with his tribe's longstanding tradition of heroic dragon slayers. Hiccup's world is turned upside down when he encounters a dragon that challenges he and his fellow Vikings to see the world from an entirely different point of view.Right off the bat, I have to say HTTYD is the first great movie of 2010, and it deserves the title rightfully so, despite of having a horrible and terribly inaccurate marketing campaign. Even a Pixar comparison wouldn't be a wrong thing to say. HTTYD is what all storytelling is about and then some. It's one of very few movies, with AVATAR, to use the 3D in such an amazing fashion to enhance the overall movie experience. In fact, not seeing this in 3D would be like having a BLT sandwich without the bacon, lettuce, AND tomatoes! It's not one of those films where the film was converted to 3D in hopes of getting more revenue from the consumers (I'm looking at you, CLASH OF THE TITANS and countless others!).Of all the Pixar films this can be compared to, WALL-E seems to be the most reasonable because of a character that does not say a single dialogue: Toothless. Toothless is one of those rare characters you see in films where you can understand his emotions and overall character just by his actions alone, and that's a pretty difficult thing to pull off, if I must say so myself. I also loved the father-son relationship explored in this film, which is very similar to that from CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS. The plot is pretty easy to understand but it's very complex underneath with the conflicting attitudes from the characters and the moral ambiguity, much like AVATAR.The film also has a wondrously, appealing visual style. There are some moments in the film where the images placed on the screen are so emotionally resonate and brilliantly perfect that they teared me up. The directors, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, seem to know what they're doing. The characters are also fantastic because they are authentic and very real. Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera, and Craig Ferguson impressed me the most. My favorite character is Toothless, who is cute and charming. Let's not forget about the action and comedic side of the film.Unlike most Dreamworks Animation picture, HTTYD does not rely on pop culture reference and toilet humor, which automatically puts the film on the heap of the group, right? The action sequences are also well done and visually stunning. On top of every positive thing I have to say about the film, I must not forget the unforgettable soundtrack, composed by the great John Powell. The score is not used as a backdrop but as an enhancer to heighten almost every scene. In fact, there is on flight sequence where the 3D technology and Powell's score mixed so well that the hairs on my neck stood up.If there is one flaw the film has, it's the predictability, but I really don't count that as a flaw if a film executes it really well. Overall, HTTYD is a surprising delight filled with whimsical action, authentic characters, and near-brilliant storytelling, not to mention rendering the 3D technology to bloody awesome use. It's going to be one of the best films of this year. That's how confident I am. Watch this movie NOW.",9,3,6,4 April 2010
Don't Breathe," An incredibly intense thriller
","Fede Alvarez just gave Green Room a run for its money with Don't Breathe, an incredibly intense film and glorious exercise in suspense. It's one of the best studio-produced thrillers I've seen in years. The premise is simple: A group of teens plans to break into a blind man's house to steal his money. Only thing, the old man is more adept than they realize. While the setup is a little too pedestrian, albeit economical, once the story gets rolling, the film doesn't let up, running at a lean 88 minutes. Other than that, Don't Breathe is best viewed going in knowing as little as possible.This is Alvarez's first film in three years since his violent and solid remake of Evil Dead, and it is with this sophomoric debut that solidifies the genre filmmaker as someone with obvious talent. Inspirations are drawn from the best - Hitchcock, Fincher, and Wait Until Dark are a few - but Alvarez provides his own unique vision that truly makes the film his own. Like the masters before him, Don't Breathe is purely cinematic, relying less on dialogue and more on visual storytelling and sound to drive the film. The cinematography is amazing as well as the creative sound design, so much so they are characters within the film themselves.The cast, while small, is great too, including Jane Levy, who can pretty much be titled this generation's scream queen after this and Evil Dead. Dylan Minnette is good in his role as well, providing enough sympathy for his character. Both young actors are put through hell, and their physical performances sell their tumultuous ordeal convincingly. However, it is Stephen Lang who is the film's shining beacon. As the antagonist, Lang is instantly memorable and frightening, an intimidating force that permeates throughout the film even in scenes without his presence.If there's one gripe about the film, there's a plot twist that doesn't quite work, but that itself is a minor complaint compared to the many things the film gets right and does so well. I won't say more. Don't Breathe is a technical achievement, the rare studio film that actually pushes what film can do as a medium. However, like with Green Room, try not to get caught up in the hype, even with my glowing review. Set your expectations appropriately, and remember to avoid watching the trailer.",9,250,385,17 March 2016
The Descent," Finally, a Real Horror Movie
","After a tragic accident, six friends reunite for a caving expedition. Their adventure soon goes horribly wrong when a collapse traps them deep underground and they find themselves pursued by bloodthirsty creatures. As their friendships deteriorate, they find themselves in a desperate struggle to survive the creatures and each other.This is probably the first R rated horror movie in a long time that actually has what a good horror movie needs: It has tense, suspense scenes, good character development, and some good violence and gore. No, it's not like one of those mainstream horror movies that has constant gore, violence, and nudity.That doesn't really mean it's one of the best horror movies. It's just a great horror movie. It was kind of disappointing that it didn't pass my expectations. Still, I have to say the film's claustrophobic feel, suspense, and lighting makes the film scary.I wouldn't say anything about the acting because all the girls kinda look the same so I really didn't know who was who and who died and all of that. Surprisingly, this film has one horror movie cliché: The scary pop ups! God, I hate those things! And I also liked for the characters in the movie actually being smart and tough and to top it off with the score of the movie!If you really want to see a horror movie without many violence, gore, and nudity like many recent R rated horror movies, you'll like this movie's fresh feel.",8,0,1,7 May 2007
Pulp Fiction," Now This is An American Classic
","Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega are two hit men who are out to retrieve a suitcase stolen from their employer, mob boss Marsellus Wallace. Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia out a few days later when Wallace himself will be out of town. Butch Coolidge is an aging boxer who is paid by Wallace to lose his next fight. The lives of these seemingly unrelated people are woven together comprising of a series of funny, bizarre and uncalled-for incidents.Great! Why did it take me so long to watch this film? Maybe because it's never on sale. Well, it finally was and I bought it on DVD. Let me take this moment to calm myself down. Before watching this movie, I was anxious of what all this hype for this movie is all about. I would've thought it would have been overrated because I did not like 'Reservoir Dogs' as much as others.But I was wrong. Why would I even think that? This is the third Quentin Tarantino film I have seen and it is easily the best of the bunch. Not only that. This film, without exaggerating, is a masterpiece! I loved every minute of it! I loved it so much I wanted it to be three hours long or at least have another story in it!Okay, it's been three days since I've watched this film and yes, the excitement have wear off but who cares? It had me excited for the other two days. For those of you people who haven't seen this film, this film is completely character driven. Now only that but the dialog in here is so great, this film won't lose your attention, even though there's dialog 60 seconds per minute.If you think character driven films are boring, maybe this isn't the film for you. I just can't get my mind off of the dialog, which was so eccentric and brilliant. This is an American classic. The characters in here are also very lovable. John Travolta seems like Tom Hanks in The Da Vinci Code with his hair due.Now off with the characters and dialog. The film is really well crafted and totally original. This is also, maybe, my first film that has three plots revolving around so maybe I might also like 'Babel' and '21 Grams'. And should I mention the music? I loved each one of them but I should say I was let down by the Travolta and Thurman dance sequence. I expected it to be flashy as a musical but what was I thinking?This is what more filmmakers should do these days. Yeah, I'm fine with remakes and sequels but it would be so much better if they make films like Pulp Fiction. If you watch this film, you would see why it had a cult following.",10,0,2,15 August 2007
Les Misérables," Emotionally Manipulative in Almost Every Way
","Let me start off by saying I was really looking forward to the film, and I love musicals. I haven't seen the stage version or read the book or watched any other film adaptations, so I knew absolutely nothing about it. When the film started, I thought it was the lamest thing ever. The singing was a bit off and everything felt awkward to watch. And then Anne Hathaway showed up, and I cried like a baby 5 minutes later. Seeing a close-up of her singing 'I Dreamed a Dream' in one take is easily the best part in the film. And when she died, it's apparent the film's strongest asset was gone. After that, I was counting the minutes to the end credits. I didn't care for any of the other characters. In fact, the poor story leaves a lot to be desired: Why does Fantine die? No reason. Why does Jean Valjean die? No reason. Why do Cosette and Ã‰ponine like Marius? No reason. There is absolutely no build-up or development to make these choices feel motivated. Why should I feel sorry for Ã‰ponine? Why should I want Cosette and Marius to be together? Why the hell did Ã‰ponine sacrifice herself to save Marius? After asking all these questions, the answer is obvious: The filmmakers are trying to make the audience cry. You throw logic out the window and aim for their hearts. Why do these incomprehensible and completely unmotivated scenes happen? So we would cry and feel sorry for these characters. Some people fell for it. I didn't. I saw how emotionally manipulative it all was, and I was honestly bored by it all. Imagine sitting in the theater for over 150 minutes being told to 'CRY. WEEP FOR THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE.' It gets funny after awhile. If some people liked the film, fine, but I didn't care for it. I didn't care for the miserable characters in it. They aren't characters. They are plot devices to make people cry.",5,19,37,30 December 2012
The Da Vinci Code," Seek The Truth
","When respected American religious symbology expert Dr. Robert Langdon is summoned to the Louvre by the French version of the FBI, led by Captain Bezu Fache, he soon discovered that he is the #1 suspect for the murder of a historian Langdon had been scheduled to meet with. Assisted by a French cryptographer and government agent named Sophie, Langdon is challenged to decipher a chain of cryptic codes and puzzles, all the while trying to stay ahead of Fache's lawmen in a chase through the Louvre, and out into the Parisian cityscape, and finally across the channel to England. Can Langdon and Sophie decipher the nature of a secret dating back to Leonardo Da Vinci and earlier before those responsible for the historian's murder add them to their hit list? Like many people, I've read the book, which was really good with a decent ending. It's actually one of the better books I've read. I had my own perspective on the book and ran through the scenes in my mind as a chase thriller. What I've seen in the movie might not be close to this perspective as I thought as I hoped.Like National Treasure, I wanted this movie to be a chase thriller. I wanted it to be thrilling and suspenseful like another other chase movie. Let me say this: The first hour was a let down. It was not suspenseful or thrilling. It was rather boring and uninteresting. It could've been a lot better. Well, it should have, after what the book has set up.With that being said, let's move on to the remaining of the film (the second full hour). Now, it gets interesting. The boring string score you heard in the first hour gets more involved and suspenseful. There's more action and it's more intriguing. Since the second half of the movie is more than the first half, I liked the movie.Tom Hanks' performance was decent, not at all that great. On the other hand, I liked Audrey Tautou's performance. The supporting casts, like Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, and Paul Bettany, were also decent. I didn't really mind the revisions in the film. It wasn't annoying or that at all different from the book. I have to say, though, that if I had not read the book, the movie would have been confusing.This isn't a great adaptation as Harry Potter, but it is decent. The movie had some good special effects, great production design, and some good cinematography. Yeah, I liked National Treasure a lot better but if you're a fan of the book, you might as well see this and hope what you get is good.",7,1,3,16 July 2007
Titanic," A Terrific Film!
","This film is about Rose DeWitt Bukater, a rich girl, and Jack Dawson, a poor boy who both fall in love on the ship, Titanic, in which it sank in 1912.This is a very wonderful film with great romance and peril. The special effects are terrific in the film. It's top notch with the action scenes and keeps the suspense going on the film. Well, that's the second half of the film.The first half is a great romance. We see Rose when she old (obviously, she survived) and she's telling the tale to ones who want to seek treasure in the ship. They don't believe her but as she tells the story, they do.I wasn't some of the millions who have seen this movie in the theater because I was practically five and there was no way that I would recognize this film. Now that I've finally seen the whole film, I've always seen the ending but never the whole movie, I loved it. I thought the first hour was going to be a waste because I don't imagine a film going 3 hours long unless the sinking occurs in the end but it occurred in the second half of the film.The acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are great. they have great chemistry in the film and others like Billy Zane and Kathy Bates are good too.This is one of the best films ever. It has great action scenes and is a great tale of romance and should be seen by people who likes watching movies.",10,3,5,17 February 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Magical Film!
","Harry Potter is an average bespectacled 11 year old boy who has lived with the Dursley family ever since his parents died in a car crash. For some reason the family has always mistreated him. On his 11th birthday a giant man named Rubeus Hagrid hands him a letter telling him that he has been accepted as a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents were wizards and were killed by an evil wizard Voldemort, a truth that was hidden from him all these years. He embarks for his new life as a student, gathering two good friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger along the way. They soon learn that something very valuable is hidden somewhere inside the school and Voldemort is very anxious to lay his hands on it.This film is a great adaptation of the book, not to mention the other Harry Potter movies. It's filled with magic and takes you in a world where it can only exists in fairy tales but this movie shows you it can be real. I loved the score for the film. It's sounds magical-like.To be honest, I was never a fan of the Harry Potter books. My cousin gave me book #1 and #4 for Christmas (I don't know about books #2 and #3) and I never read them. Then I bought the first movie with interest and all of a sudden, I'm a huge fan of this series. I loved all the books and the movies!Daniel Radcliffe plays a great Harry Potter as well with the perfect casting by Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. The whole sets in the film are wonderful. I love the action sequences and the CGI in the film (there aren't many). This movie is not all about the action and CGI and modern technology. It has a great story filled with humor, emotion, and suspense.This film doesn't feel long. It's a great family film with magical sets, action sequences, story, and comedic scenes. If you are a fan or a non-fan of the book, either way, you will enjoy the film tremendously. It's the Wizard of Oz of our time!",8,0,1,21 June 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Dark and Difficult Times Lie Ahead
","Harry's fourth summer and the following year at Hogwarts are marked by the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament, in which student representatives from three different wizarding schools compete in a series of increasingly challenging contests. However, Voldemort's Death Eaters are gaining strength and even creating the Dark Mark giving evidence that the Dark Lord is ready to rise again.In the unsuspecting lives of the young wizard and witches at Hogwarts the competitors are selected by the goblet of fire, which this year makes a very surprising announcement: Hogwarts will have two representatives in the tournament, including Harry Potter! Will Harry be able to rise to the challenge for the Tri Wizard Tournament while keeping up with school or will the challenges along with Voldemort's rebirth be too much for the young hero?This movie is the best entry in the Harry Potter series yet! It's weird. Each film gets better and better. For regular folks (who never read the books), you will enjoy this film immensely. For Harry Potter fans (like me), it'll depend. Unlike the first two films, this (and the third) focuses more on the story, instead of making a 15 hour movie. No doubt this film is the darkest yet, receiving a PG-13. Parents need to take that as caution because there are things too scary for little children.Yeah, I was quite disappointed they cut out and revised so many thing in the movie but you know what? Who cares? I loved every moment in this film. I really didn't mind the revisions and editing. You got to hand it to Steve Kloves who does a hell of a job writing the scripts and J.K. Rowling writing the books.Like I said in the past three films, this film isn't all about the action and special effects. It contains more mature roles on the three main cast and it has a plot, unlike many dumb popcorn movie. The performances by the main cast (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) are better and their interaction is still great. You'll find them engaging.The special effects (which gets better in every film) is terrific. There are even more action scenes in here, some which are mind blowing and keeps you to the edge of your seats. The set designs are even better and the whole 'teen romance' is a bit exaggerated but it's fantastic! The music is different in here, and it's better. The cinematography is also good.I think Mike Newell does a terrific job on delivering this book to the screen. Although some fans will not like it for the huge cuts, some will love it for that very reason. Average movie goers will also love this. This, not only the best entry so far, this is one of the best movies of 2005!",9,0,1,14 July 2007
Thor," Two worlds. One hero.
","The epic adventure THOR spans the Marvel Universe from present day Earth to the mystical realm of Asgard. At the center of the story is The Mighty Thor, a powerful but arrogant warrior whose reckless actions reignite an ancient war. As a result, Thor is banished to Earth where he is forced to live among humans. When the most dangerous villain of his world sends its darkest forces to invade Earth, Thor learns what it takes to be a true hero. (C) Paramount PicturesTHOR is a mediocre superhero flick. It opens with a shaky 10 minute beginning that introduces the mythology of THOR in a fast pace with exposition-esque dialogue. Here, you can see one of the main problems of the film: The scenes in Asgard are waaay too serious. So serious, in fact, that you might find yourself laughing unintentionally at the damn cheesy lines that are being said by the actors with a straight face. Fortunately, most of the film takes place on Earth, where it DOESN'T take itself too seriously. This is good because the film is actually really funny when it needs to be. This is mostly due to the whole 'fish out of water' aspect of the film with Thor being banished on Earth. He acts the same way as he does on Asgard, and that is what makes it funny.Saying that, you might feel that there were two directors working on this film because of the completely different tones between the settings on Asgard and Earth. Since THOR jumps between the two settings now and again, you feel like it's doing a juggling act to try to balance the serious and laid back parts of the film. I can't say the film maintained it too well since I just couldn't take the Asgard scenes seriously. And those partly to blame is on the actors themselves.For starters, I didn't think Chris Hemsworth had enough in him to play the serious side of his character. Every time he tried, I had to hold the laugh waiting to burst out within me. As an actor in general, I think Hemsworth is great. He CAN do serious, as seen in A PERFECT GETAWAY and the opening of STAR TREK (2009). It's just that he couldn't do it here. Tom Hiddleston is a bit better, but I felt that he sometimes played his character more over-the-top than it needed to be. I can't say many good things about Anthony Hopkins either. I felt like he just wanted a paycheck. However, I did like Idris Elba. He played his serious character without being too laughable.The 'human' actors, on the other hand, are better. As much as I love Natalie Portman, I didn't think she did much here. She seemed to just go through the motions with nothing spectacular to do in particular. Even her chemistry with Hemsworth didn't seem convincing enough. Kat Dennings' character, on the other hand, might be my favorite. She provides some of the films biggest laughs, and it's obvious her character is in the film to only provide comedic relief. Stellan Skarsgård was pretty good too, but he doesn't get to show much range.As for the action in THOR, I must say that I was pretty disappointed. Apart from the opening action sequence in Jotunheim, the majority of the action scenes were pretty middling and incomprehensible. Even the scene with the Destroyer seems to be a rip-off of Klaatu from THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (2008). I just felt the film had too much CGI and not enough practical effects to make the action scenes memorable or exciting enough. I guess I was spoiled with the fresh and exciting action scenes in FAST FIVE the week before. Overall, I found THOR to be mildly enjoyable mostly because of the scenes on Earth. It's not the worst superhero flick, but it's not THE DARK KNIGHT either. It's just 'there.' Once the credits roll, you'll forget mostly everything about it. 5.5/10",6,7,15,7 May 2011
The Fountain," What If You Could Live Forever?
","Three stories - one each from the past, present, and future - about men in pursuit of eternity with their love. A conquistador in Mayan country searches for the tree of life to free his captive queen; a medical researcher, working with various trees, looks for a cure that will save his dying wife; a space traveler, traveling with an aged tree encapsulated within a bubble, moves toward a dying star that's wrapped in a nebula; he seeks eternity with his love. The stories intersect and parallel; the quests fail and succeed.Seeing how extremely similar (in the execution; not the story) this film is to 'Blade Runner, '2001: A Space Odyssey,' and 'Solaris,' I'm not surprised I didn't like the film. Basically, if you don't like the movies I've mentioned, you won't like this film. If you do, you'll absolutely love this film.The trailer for this movie interested me. When I saw the movie, it was like an art film. I'm sorry but I don't like films that try to be art in movies. After awhile, I got lost track from the story because it was just too confusing and boring for my taste. But for every person who hates this movie, there are people who loved it.With that said, this film polarized audiences. I don't think you can rate an art film but I'll just give it a 5/10 to be fair. I didn't quite like the chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz at all. However, the film is quite beautiful and visually extensive. In the end, though, you might hate it or love it.",4,1,6,13 August 2008
Zombieland," Nut Up or Shut Up
","Columbus is a big wuss -- but when you're afraid of being eaten by zombies, fear can keep you alive. Tallahassee is an AK-toting, zombie-slaying' bad ass whose single determination is to get the last Twinkie on earth. As they join forces with Wichita and Little Rock, who have also found unique ways to survive the zombie mayhem, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombies.For this review, I'll refrain from comparing ZOMBIELAND with SHAUN OF THE DEAD, even though I probably will in the course of writing it. To start things off, ZOMBIELAND has one of the most beautiful opening credits scene in movie history. In fact, it's reminiscent of one I saw in WATCHMEN months earlier. But let's get to the point, much like the movie, which runs at a scant 80 minutes: ZOMBIELAND is one of those laugh-per-minute movies in which most of the jokes thrown on the screen work because they are clever and witty.It's also not one of those movies in which survivors are looking for a cure or loved ones. In fact, there's not much of a story structure in here. Just think of it as a road trip movie that happens to take place in a world filled with zombies and that's part of the fun in this movie. It's about a group of people who, at first, don't trust each other but slowly, and surely, start to grow on one another. This adds humanity to the movie. At one point, one of the characters call ANACONDA an R rated movie when it's really rated PG-13. This shows that everybody makes mistakes and aren't perfect.As funny the movie is, there's also a sweet and an endearing side to it. One such character we come to love the first minute we see him is played by Jesse Eisenberg, whom many will compare to Michael Cera, although Eisenberg has appeared in movies before Cera, including CURSED by Wes Craven. Along with him, the rest of the cast really make the movie have a higher standard than most in this genre. Woody Harrelson is just perfect for the role, having some great one-liners too. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin also do a great job. There's also one great, hilarious cameo in here which I dare not spoil. You will have to see it for yourself.Although the zombie genre may seem dead, movies like ZOMBIELAND give it a reason to stay. The movie is very funny but also has a sweet side to it. The movie has it's touching moments along with some zombie action, especially towards the end. Oh, and if you're worried about the short running time, don't worry about it. The movie felt longer than that. Watch it if you're a fan of the zombie genre. If you're not, I still think it's worth the watch. Oh, and I've managed to not compare this film with SHAUN OF THE DEAD!",7,1,5,4 October 2009
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The Magic Continues!
","Forced to spend his summer holidays with his muggle relations, Harry Potter gets a real shock when he gets a surprise visitor: Dobby the house-elf, who warns Harry Potter against returning to Hogwarts, for terrible things are going to happen. Harry decides to ignore Dobby's warning and continues with his pre-arranged schedule. But at Hogwarts, strange and terrible things are indeed happening: Harry is suddenly hearing mysterious voices from inside the walls, muggle-born students are being attacked, and a message scrawled on the wall in blood puts everyone on his/her guard - 'The Chamber Of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies Of The Heir, Beware'.This film is darker than the first film (obviously each Harry Potter films get darker within each sequel) and there's much more great action sequences and faster paced. This movie is faithful to the book but it's like Chris Columbus wants to fit everything in the movie (unlike the third and fourth movie) which results them to be almost three hour movies instead of focusing to the plot. Well, I don't mind that.There are much funnier comedic and more scarier scenes in this movie. Those who haven't read the books will get more information of Voldermort and Harry Potter and those who haven't seen the first film needs to see it to understand this second film. It's not a movie that stands for itself.Again, the score is terrific, giving the movie a magical feel. The CGI for Dobby, ghosts, and the action sequences are fantastic. The main trio's acting is yet again terrific and fits well with the book's characters. And I would give a moment to remember Richard Harris, who sadly passed away after filming this movie. He portrays a great Dumbledore.I wouldn't know if this movie is better than the first. Each Harry Potter films are terrific and some of the best films ever created. If you're a Harry Potter fan, you'll like this movie. If not, well, you'll still enjoy it as much as I did. It's a fantastic family film!",9,0,2,25 June 2007
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Fun
","A married couple are getting bored with their quiet domestic life. What they don't know, however, is that they're both assassins, secretly hopping the world and killing for hire. But their separate lives are about to collide when each finds out their next target is their own spouse.This is a very entertaining fun film from the very beginning to the end. It's pure excitement and fun. There are great action scenes, funny comedic scenes, and sweet emotional scenes. The dialog is well written with some witty one liners.It's an entertaining popcorn movie. The CGI is well done within the action scenes. It looks like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are having a good time making this film that we also enjoy it as much as they did making it. The chemistry by those two are great as well with their acting.If you would like to be entertained in a movie with great action scenes and great dialog, this is the film. It's just a fun film, although not anything great or Oscar material.",6,3,6,24 June 2007
Die Hard," Yippy-Kay-Yay Motherf*cker
","New York cop John McCLane flies to Los Angeles on Christmas eve to spend the holidays with his family. He arrives at the Nakatomi corp. building for his wife's office party. International terrorists take over the building and hold every one as hostage to steel $600 million of bonds from the vaults of the building. Now its up to McCLane to face the terrorists and save his wife and the other hostages.I wouldn't know why this film is rated so high on IMDb, but this site is known for having bizarre ratings. Well, I would call this your average action film. It has one liners, a lot of violence, guns, profanity, explosions, villains, and many people.I would love to say this is a very entertaining action flick, although it's running time is longer than it needs to be (I mean, two hours for an action film?). I love some memorable dialog, made by Bruce Willis' character, and the humor of it. It just doesn't take itself too seriously. Just relax.I like, or love, Bruce Willis' acting. John McClane is a fun character to play, I imagine. Other acting, like Alan Rickman, were pretty good too. I also love the mindless action here and there. They never seem to end, do they?This is your usual action flick with humor and doesn't take itself too seriously. If you would like to watch this film with your brain turned off to have a good time, this is the film.",7,2,4,9 June 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Revenge is coming.
","Decepticon forces return to Earth on a mission to take Sam Witwicky prisoner, after the young hero learns the truth about the ancient origins of the Transformers. Joining the mission to protect humankind is Optimus Prime, who forms an alliance with international armies for a second epic battle.So there it was. The trailer. Played on the silver screen. It looked darker than the previous film. The tagline 'Revenge is coming' reinforces that aspect. It excited me. This could really be a serious, dark movie, like THE DARK KNIGHT. I was wrong. So wrong. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. I was insane hoping for a serious, dark, gritty action flick from Michael Bay. In fact, the trailer doesn't show any of the crude and sexual humor throughout the film. And you know what? I found the jokes pretty funny. Sure, some of the jokes are just disgusting (you'd be surprised what lays hidden in this movie), but I liked the laid back feel.The plot was...confusing, I will admit, but in a film like this, does it really matter? The movie never ceases to be entertaining. The action sequences are amazing, but directed by Michael Bay, it's not surprising. If there is one thing I have to say about him, he knows how to entertain audiences. And he was right when he said there would be more action scenes in the film. You thought the first movie had a lot of action scenes? Oh, God, I wouldn't even begin. To keep it simple, the special effects are nothing short of being flawless. I loved the score by Steve Jablonsky, most of it being brought back from the first movie.In an interview with Megan Fox, the sexy actress said the following: 'This movie is not about acting.' And she's right. I can go on saying that the humans in the films were actually the robots, but that's not particularly true. You have to give credit to Shia LaBeouf's part, at least. He does a swell job, given the material. I found John Turturro to be quite annoying in the first film but the producers or writers decided it was a good idea to bring him back. I still found him annoying in the film and I especially rolled my eyes when he was doing a serious scene.This goes along with Sam's parents in the film, Kevin Dunn and Julie White, although I don't find them quite as annoying. In fact, I enjoyed most of their scenes. They give some good comic relief throughout the film. I just didn't like them being serious because you just can't take them seriously. The writers apparently thought Ramon Rodriguez's character was a good idea. I just really hated him. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson also returned for the sequel, although they don't have much to do. Overall, the whole cast pretty much had one thing to do: Run in slow motion.With all the positives, there was no doubt some negatives. The most obvious is the overly long running time. I don't think Michael Bay ever made a movie less than two hours. I would've liked the movie if it were thirty minutes shorter. It was until the third act that I realized how long the movie was going to be. It started to meander a bit after that and there came a point in the film that there was just overkill. The movie was just really long. Another thing that annoyed me was a pair of twin Transformers. Actually, add another Transformer. All three of them were yelling profanity throughout. Not my thing.If you walk into the movie with the right mindset, you'd be surprised that you had enjoyed most of the film. The action sequences are just fantastic but the plot is lacking. The actors don't have much to do but to run around and scream. But really, what are you going to expect when you walk into a Michael Bay film? A plot? Great performances? A delightful script? Nah. You'd expect action. Action. And did I mention action?",6,0,4,28 June 2009
Steve Jobs," Simply Masterful
","Is Steve Jobs the movie of the year? Obviously. Clearly. The first 30 minutes of the film itself is so well constructed from the writing, directing, performances, pacing, soundtrack, and editing that you are witnessing masters do what they do best. With the names of Boyle, Sorkin, Fassbender, and Winslet, would anyone expect less? No, I'm not saying these things because I love Apple products or I think Steve Jobs himself was a genius, a visionary. It's just the simple fact that the film is masterful in nearly every way. It puts to shame almost every film released this year and the previous ten years. It's that good.Running at about two hours, the film feels like one, which is impressive considering it's essentially a bunch of scenes of people talking to each other. The film rarely feels slow and remains compelling to the very end, moving at an incredibly brisk pace. Not even The Social Network could pull that off. Then again, Steve Jobs is an entirely different beast, with the only similarities being their Sorkin-ess scripts. Everything else is unalike because Danny Boyle is a completely different director from David Fincher. Yeah, it would have been cool to see a Social Network reunion, but it's just as great to witness Boyle's distinct style overtake the screenplay. Again, these are masters who know their craft.The performances are top notch, but of course they are. Michael Fassbender is a chameleon, transforming into the titular role of Steve Jobs. Sure, he doesn't look like Jobs but does it even matter when he's this good? Kate Winslet is alongside Fassbender through most of the film, and while her European accent comes in and out for a few scenes, she's fantastic. Other supporting roles range from good to great, including Michael Stuhlbarg and even Seth Rogen, but it is Perla Haney-Jardine who stands out as Jobs' daughter. She's in a small but nevertheless important section of the film and becomes instantly memorable in her limited screen time.The success of the film isn't that it's about Jobs himself or the products that he made. In fact, Sorkin cleverly ditches the cradle to the grave biopic we've seen too many times and instead, focuses on Jobs' relationship with his daughter. It's an affecting storyline, tapping into the universal themes of family, love, wanting to be loved or, at the very least, acknowledged. It's the beating heart of Steve Jobs, the thing that keeps the film alive, and don't be surprised when you're crying by the end because you will. That, perhaps, might be the most surprising aspect of the film of all.",10,11,27,14 October 2015
War of the Worlds," Run! Run for Your Lives!
","The plot is easy to understand: Ray Ferrier lives in New Jersy, divorced by his wife who got his two kids which spends with one another every couple of days. Ray works in the docks. Rachel and Robbie are never happy to see Dad compared to Mom, for a couple of days to stay. As they stay and Mom leaves them with Dad, a lightning hits the ground. The ground shakes and a tripod comes out and we figure that aliens are inside and are invading the Earth. Now Ray must protect his two kids to survive from the invasion as they walk to Mom's in Boston.The tripods shoot people with their heat rays which turns them to dust. The designs for each tripod are amazing. There are three types of tripods that do different things. The movie is one of Steven Spielberg's best movie. The CGI effects are terrific. It's a first rate edge-of-your-seats thriller! It's so exciting, you'll have to watch it again! The acting is great in this film. Steven's vision for the film is good. Do not believe the other reviewers who said that this film is bad because it's not. Maybe the ending is what bothers them. The ending was the true ending from the book by H.G. Wells. The ending is satisfying for me enough.Once, Steven made a film called E.T. It's sweet and heart warming, This movie is no where close to that. this film is rather dark and scary in some parts. If you compare the special effects to The Day After Tomorrow, The Day After Tomorrow will win, although it would be close. Steven also makes it feel that they might survive in the invasion as many bad things occur to the family.It's just a harmless fun entertaining summer blockbuster. Yes, there are some clichÃ©s here and there but don't bother with them. Just watch it and you'll forget it.",9,3,7,16 June 2006
Love Actually," Love Actually Is All Around
","This film follows the lives of eight very different couples in dealing with their love lives in various loosely and interrelated tales all set during a frantic month before Christmas in London, England.This film is one of the best romantic film. It could probably have anything you ever wanted in a romance. There's the old marriage proposal in a restaurant and language barriers.The acting is great by all of the cast. There are some sweet and sometimes very funny moments in the film. There are some very great dialog in the film too.In this world, you probably think there are greedy and bad people out there but this film actually shows that love is all around us. It even mentions the 9/11 moment where each people call their families with love rather than hatred.This is a very well made film that is light-hearted and funny at times. If you don't mind this film being that long, then you can watch it if you want to.",7,0,2,17 February 2007
30 Days of Night," Good Concept, Decent Storytelling
","This is the story of an isolated Alaskan town that is plunged into darkness for a month each year when the sun sinks below the horizon. As the last rays of light fade, the town is attacked by a bloodthirsty gang of vampires bent on an uninterrupted orgy of destruction. Only the small town's husband-and-wife Sheriff team stand between the survivors and certain destruction.No, I'm not a fan of the comic book(s) and yes, I'm a fan of David Slade's previous movie, 'Hard Candy'. So was this a film as good as 'Hard Candy'? Certainly not. But this film is better than most movies with this genre (AKA vampire movies).What I think might disappoint fans is the slow beginning.Like usual horror movies, there always come a bloody prologue resulting to kills and gore. Well, this one does not. Instead, literally nothing happens in about 40 minutes, if you exclude the random scenes of animal and human kills.I like the set up and the slow beginning obviously wants you to get to know the characters but what you get is no less than other horror movies that start off the violence right away. So yes, I think that might disappoint horror fans out there.What's after that is your usual bloody kills, chases with the shaky cam, and some decent plot themes. What I like most from the movie is the cinematography and the look/effects of the film. This film looks beautiful. It makes Alaska look beautiful.What I also like are the scenes that had some tension. There are little but that's better than most horror movies I've seen because I seem to never get scared of anything. The performances by the actors/actresses are decent but nothing special.What I find annoying is that the movie takes place over 30 days, or nights. So if you're watching the film and when 40 minutes passed with 'Day 7' on the bottom of the screen, it will mostly cause you to make a huge sigh. When another 30 minutes pass and says 'Day 17' on the bottom screen, you might look at your watch. Yes, these things annoy me because it makes the movie feel slow. Just to remind you, this is about two hours long. Maybe they should've gone with '12 Hours of Night'? Yes, there is lots of blood. Yes, the violence is relentless (some kills are off screen, though). And yes, the ending is so similar to one other vampire movie that I will not say, which is encouraging and depressing, I suppose. Horror fans might be disappointed with the slow beginning but will love the remaining parts of the movie. I just thought it was your above-average vampire movie, which doesn't mean that much.",6,14,29,22 October 2007
To Kill a Mockingbird," Remains True With The Book
","Atticus Finch, a lawyer in the Depression-era South, defends a black man against an undeserved rape charge, and his kids against prejudice. The kids also tries to have a look a Arthur 'Boo' Radley, who is known to stay at his house without ever coming out.Some scenes were not in the movie that were in the book, which made me disappointed. I know people say that the movie is never exactly like the book but there were really rushing things. It felt like a short movie.Although it has some flaws, I would like to say there were some memorable scenes and great portrayal of the characters in the book. One memorable scene is the court scene, of course. That's the scene where Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck, makes his famous speech.The acting by Gregory Peck is fantastic winning him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Others like Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are believable, which I really find useless in the book and in the film. Well, perhaps they were to make the film not so dark.This film is fantastic, with great acting but has its flaws. Still, it's one of the best movies and should be seen.",9,0,1,13 March 2007
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A Fantastic War Epic
","The film deals with the situation of British prisoners of war during World War II who are ordered to build a bridge to accommodate the Burma-Siam railway. Their instinct is to sabotage the bridge but, under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson, they are persuaded that the bridge should be constructed as a symbol of British morale, spirit and dignity in adverse circumstances. At first, the prisoners admire Nicholson when he bravely endures torture rather than compromise his principles for the benefit of the Japanese commandant Saito. He is an honorable but arrogant man, who is slowly revealed to be a deluded obsessive. He convinces himself that the bridge is a monument to British character, but actually is a monument to himself, and his insistence on its construction becomes a subtle form of collaboration with the enemy. Unknown to him, the Allies have sent a mission into the jungle, led by Warden and an American, Shears, to blow up the bridge.If anyone who knows me, I'm reluctant to see classic films. I just don't like old films but I was quite interested to see this film. The script is fantastic! I'm surprised that the movie was gripping and filled with suspense and humor.What I like about the movie is that you wouldn't know who is the villain. The so called 'hero' will act as a villain in some point in the film and the so called 'villain' will act as if he's a hero. I liked the realism of the movie. It's more of what the payoff of the movie is.Everything builds up until the end and I would like to say it's great with the climax. The whole scenery in the movie is great, as well as the cinematography. The score is brilliantly made and is very memorable until this day.The performances are Oscar-worthy. Sometimes one actor leaves the spot light for another actor to give his great performance. I liked the acting by William Holden and certainly Alec Guinness. Sessue Hayakawa's acting was also good, giving a strong realistic performance.This movie was great from the beginning to the end, although I find some scenes unnecessary because it's a long, long movie. With great and solid performances and a fantastic script and score, this is one masterpiece no one should miss!",9,1,3,29 June 2007
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Think fast. Look alive. Die hard.
","John McClane is back and is facing one of his greatest challenges yet. It's New York City and an individual, known only as 'Simon'. He has planted explosive devices in different locations of the city, and the only way for McClane to stop them is to follow what Simon says. Dragging Zeus into the problem, McClane must solve every riddle that Simon gives and get to each bomb before it goes off.Bruce Willis looks tired. Really tired. I am tired. Really tired. Seeing how this is the fourth Die Hard film I've seen and this is the third Die Hard film in the franchise, I'm not surprised I got this reaction. Everything is just too tiring to watch and enjoy anymore. To top it off, this movie takes entirely too long to set up everything and entirely too long itself. If the movie was fast paced and cut about 40 minutes out, I'm sure it would've worked.Anyway, I was looking forward to this movie. I was disappointed. I don't know. I just expected much more and some ingenious ideas floating around. There is maybe one idea that I remember that was smart and neat but other than that, nada. No, this is on a much larger scale than the first two, yes, but everything gets old and boring and uninteresting after 40 minutes and the climax is just unnecessarily long too.Bruce Willis' performance the third time around seems too tiring. He doesn't look interested in his character anymore. The one liners aren't as fun to hear as the other three movies and that one liner seemed out of place, as if placed in there because the previous two movies had that line. Jeremy Irons performance was decent, I guess, but not anything special though and Samuel L. Jackson's performance was pretty good.In the end, the movie was a big let down and a huge disappointment. I found Die Hard a decent action movie, Die Hard 2 really entertaining, and Live Free or Die Hard the most fun I've had in the cinema! This one just seems dead and out there for no other reason then to just make another movie for the fun of it. I wasn't having fun. Instead, I was yearning this film to finish. Oh, well.",6,0,3,21 April 2008
August Rush," All You Have To Do Is Listen
","The story of a charismatic young Irish guitarist and a sheltered young cellist who have a chance encounter one magical night above New York's Washington Square, but are soon torn apart, leaving in their wake an infant, August Rush, orphaned by circumstance. Now performing on the streets of New York and cared for by a mysterious stranger, August uses his remarkable musical talent to seek the parents from whom he was separated at birth.The trailer for the film is one of the most inspirational trailers I've ever seen. Unfortunately, most of the movie is nothing like it. This film is so depressing and nothing like a family movie (for the most part). I'm not saying I don't like it. I'm saying I wasn't ready for what was in store for me.The movie is too melodramatic for my taste, if that's possible. The film is also predictable and improbable at the same time. However, some of the music numbers are good, as well as the performances by Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers.Sad, this movie had the potential. There were some great things and some very stupid things. The ending also felt rushed. The movie is just too depressing, melodramatic, sappy, scary, disturbing, laughable, and sometimes cruel, all at once! I guess the movie has its own pros and cons and I'm being lenient to this movie. It'll be decent enough for a rent.",6,0,2,17 March 2008
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," A Hysterical Film!
","Ron Burgundy is San Diego's top rated newsman in the male dominated broadcasting of the 1970's, but that's all about to change when a new female employee, Veronica Corningstone, with ambition to burn arrives in his office.This is an above-average comedy that has clever and corny jokes which is the reason why this film is so funny. The most notable funniest character in the movie is Brick Tamland, played by Steve Carell, of course. The dialog is filled with witty and smart humor rather than physical and toilet humor, which I don't mind.These characters act so serious in the movie that they don't even know they're funny. I mean, even though the movie tries to act serious doesn't mean it is meant to be taken seriously, like the last part of the film.Tons of characters in the movie, including Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate, give funny performances. There are also tons of funny cameos by other actors and actresses.Ig you actually want to laugh out loud and want a great comedy with funny performances, this is the movie!",7,0,2,3 February 2007
American Gangster," There are two sides to the American dream
","Following the death of his employer and mentor, Bumpy Johnson, Frank Lucas establishes himself as the number one importer of heroin in the Harlem district of Manhattan. Meanwhile, a dedicated and honest policeman, Richie Roberts, heads up a joint narcotics task force with the Federal government.I'm biased towards gangster films. No, not films like 'Lucky # Slevin' and 'Running Scared.' Those two films are unlike any gangster films I've ever seen. I'm biased towards films like 'Scarface,' 'The Departed,' 'Carlito's Way,' etc. The real gangster films. Why? I just don't like to watch such things like that.I was and wasn't looking forward to this. Like many successful gangster films, this peaked my interest, yet I'm still against these types of films. Like 'The Departed,' there wasn't really anything special and brilliant about this film. However, I will say it tries to be different than just naming people 'Johnny' and 'Carlito' or 'Pablo.'Like 'The Departed,' the true and best part of this film is during the third act, where everything builds up and eventually lead to a satisfying confrontation and/or ending. The first and second acts aren't too interesting to me. Sure, there are probably about seven scenes that would interest me but overall, nothing special.The performances by 'Denzel Washington' and 'Russel Crowe' are as good as always; no questions about it, however, I did not really connect with Crowe's accent. This wasn't a brilliant film, nor a modern masterpiece, in my opinion. I just think the only good part with gangster films are their endings and this one isn't different.",6,0,1,9 April 2008
Hancock," There are heroes...there are superheroes...and then there's Hancock.
","With great power comes great responsibility -- everyone knows that -- everyone, that is, but Hancock. Edgy, conflicted, sarcastic, and misunderstood, Hancock's well-intentioned heroics might get the job done and save countless lives, but always seem to leave jaw-dropping damage in their wake. The public has finally had enough -- as grateful as they are to have their local hero, the good citizens of Los Angeles are wondering what they ever did to deserve this guy. Hancock isn't the kind of man who cares what other people think -- until the day that he saves the life of PR executive Ray Embrey, and the sardonic superhero begins to realize that he may have a vulnerable side after all. Facing that will be Hancock's greatest challenge yet -- and a task that may prove impossible as Ray's wife, Mary, insists that he's a lost cause.After seeing the theatrical trailer for this movie, I didn't really want to see it as much as most summer movies. I didn't want to see Will Smith acting like an a-hole is his movies. I don't think anyone does but I saw this film anyway. And you know what? This has got to be one of the biggest surprises this summer! I loved it! Hancock is a movie where it answers the question, 'What happens if a superhero just doesn't care?' And it does it great! Will Smith plays well as the misunderstood superhero. He does a great job. Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are good supporting roles. What I didn't like about the film is that it was marketed in a wrong way. What you see in the trailers for this film is basically the first thirty minutes of the entire movie. It's marketed as a superhero comedy. Well, the jokes are funny but there are also dramatic scenes in here. It adds a surprising sense of sweetness in the film.Unlike other superhero movies, 'Hancock' isn't based on a comic book so no one really has an idea of what's going to happen in this film and that's what makes the movie so great! Finally, a superhero movie that isn't predictable (in most cases). The film does a great job giving us the information that we would need to know, although it doesn't answer all the questions we want to know, like how Hancock obtained his powers and so on and so forth. The movie also has some surprising twists and turns to keep audiences interested. When you think this is going to happen, a twist comes to keep you off guard which makes the film quite refreshing and original than most superhero movies. The action scenes are good, although maybe not as big and great as you expect it to be.And I must say, John Powell does an EXCELLENT job with the score for the film. I also think this is one of Peter Berg's better films. Now don't go expecting what the TV spots and trailers show you. The film is quite sweet and has a good moral message in the end and doesn't really have as many jokes as you would expect. Will Smith does a great job playing the character and the film is quite fresh and original. Like I said, this has got to be the biggest surprise of this summer so far! And yes, this movie is quite entertaining! Go see it!",8,4,8,5 July 2008
Inception," Your mind is the scene of the crime
","INCEPTION is a film in which you want to go in knowing nothing because it's best seen with no prior knowledge. So I'm just going to not say a word about the plot and have the film unfold in front of you, sometimes literally. It's pretty difficult to explain what INCEPTION really is because it's damn packed with so many interesting ideas. Really, when you come out of the theater, you'll only think, 'What did I just see?' The film is filled with so much ambition and so many original ideas that it captivates you. In fact, I think this is the fastest 150 minute film I've ever seen because it felt like 80 minutes! I really wanted to see more when the credits rolled.Unfortunately, INCEPTION isn't a perfect film. It falls short on its ambition. Some ideas weren't as developed as I hope they would be and others weren't presented clear enough. In fact, it's as if the characters spoke in another type of jargon exclusively made for psychologists pursuing in the career of dreams. Also, the story isn't all that special. Another common complaint you might hear about the film is that the characters are flat. It's true. The film presents us with six or seven characters but does absolutely nothing with them. Leonardo DiCaprio's character is the only character that's fleshed out. In some cases, I didn't care for the characters when their lives were at stake.Still, the performances by the ensemble cast are really good. I enjoyed Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy in their roles a lot. I might not be the only person to notice this but I thought Leonardo DiCaprio played the exact same character as he did in SHUTTER ISLAND. I couldn't get past Ken Watanabe's thick accent. It was hard to understand him in many of his scenes. Marion Cotillard did a great job, though.The film is also visually intricate, if that makes sense and even that description doesn't give the film justice. Again, it's really hard to explain. The visual effects were really excellent along with the action scenes but don't expect this film to be filled with action. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer (AKA: One of the best composers ever) is fantastic, much like Zimmer's other soundtracks.Overall, INCEPTION is a flawed but seriously excellent film that presents some very, very, very interesting ideas. It's a wholly original film, which is great considering the amount of remakes, re-imaginings, sequels, prequels, etc. that we've gotten in the past few years, let alone this year. The characters could have been fleshed out a lot more. Still, I was absolutely engaged throughout by the story, and Christopher Nolan's ingenious script and direction just sucks you in. This is the perfect cure for this year's lackluster summer.",7,19,39,16 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Nothing Escapes Him
","In a dynamic new portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous characters, SHERLOCK HOLMES sends Holmes and his stalwart partner Watson on their latest challenge. Revealing fighting skills as lethal as his legendary intellect, Holmes will battle as never before to bring down a new nemesis and unravel a deadly plot that could destroy the country.It embarrasses me to say that I have not read the original series of novels of Sherlock Holmes nor have I seen the most well known TV shows or movies. However, I did see a cartoon series on Holmes when I was a little kid, so I know the basic gist of the characters of Holmes and Watson.This adaptation of one of the most well known characters in human history is quite good, I must say. Director Guy Ritchie reinvents Holmes as a more masculine character who knows how to do martial arts. While this may bother the die hard fans out there, I think it's quite fresh and appropriate to our 21st Century society. On top of that, it's obvious Warner Bros. was trying to appeal to the teenage audience as well as the fans. But overall, I think Ritchie's style gives the film a more hip and eccentric vibe.However, what makes this movie successful at what it does is the actors. Robert Downey's Holmes is quite fantastic. The fact that Holmes pays attention to every detail and calculates almost every action that occurs and, at times, without the audiences even knowing it, is what made me love this character. It also helps that Robert Downey and Jude Law have great chemistry. They play off their dialogue so well that I just have to smile. Jude Law is the perfect sidekick. Rachel McAdams and Mark Strong are also great, although the latter is sorely underused.The visual style of the film is very pretty to look at. From the visual effects to the production design to the wardrobe to the attention of certain colors used in scenes, SHERLOCK HOLMES arguably succeeds in every category. Han Zimmer's soundtrack is also very unique, the main theme diverting from your usual orchestral playing.Maybe the one problem about the film is the script and plot. It needs a bit of work because the more you think about the story, the more plot inconsistencies you find. However, as a mindless fun film, it succeeds in doing just that. It's entertaining from beginning to end mainly because of the strong cast and director Guy Ritchie. Sure, it's not the greatest film of all time but it sure is wildly entertaining for what it is.",8,0,1,23 January 2010
WALL·E," Pixar Does it Again!
","The year is 2700. WALL-E, a robot, spends every day doing what he was made for. But soon, he will discover what he was meant for.I have just finished seeing this film on the big screen and there's no exception here, Pixar has made another brilliant film! No, Wall-E is nothing short of what movies should be. What can I say about this film? What makes it so great? To start it off, there is barely any dialog in here. The first 30 minutes into the film has no dialog at all, yet the film manages to pull it off.The look of the film is very grand and visually extensive, no doubt. The animation is pitch perfect, like the rest of Pixar's previous films and this movie actually pulls off a great plot! And you know what I'm worried about? People will complain the movie is 'too preachy,' while one critic already said it's 'An Inconvenient Truth' for the kids. If you're one of those people, please don't be such a wimp and fuss about because there's a good moral message in here, along with an irresistible romance between the two protagonists, Wall-E and Eve.While it's really hard to decide which is the 'best Pixar film,' Wall-E could be nominated. It's one of the more satisfying films I've seen in theater that was worth the money. I also found the movie touching and heart warming, as well as hilarious in some great comedic scenes. I also found the film awfully similar to '2001: A Space Odyssey,' even though I have never seen it in my entire life. I guess that's a homage.As I ramble on with the movie I've just seen, let me finish this off by saying that this movie is worth your time and money. I find it the best film of this year, so far and I think it'll be hard to beat in the Oscars. The film is better for the adults than for the kids, if that's possible, but everyone at all ages should like it, unless they are cold-hearted.",10,2,6,28 June 2008
Arrival," An Affecting Tale of Humanity and Compassion
","I've been looking forward to this film since I read Eric Heisserer's screenplay nearly four years ago, previously titled STORY OF YOUR LIFE and adapted from Ted Chiang's short story of the same name. It was the first time I ever cried while reading a script, so to say I was worried the film wouldn't surpass my highest expectations would be an understatement. As you can tell from my rating, I absolutely loved ARRIVAL. It's easily one of the best films of the year and one of the most affecting sci-fi films I've ever seen.I've been a staunch supporter of Heisserer ever since I read his script, but back then, people only knew him for the A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET remake, THE THING prequel, and (the surprisingly good) FINAL DESTINATION 5. Since then, he's proved himself of being a capable writer with HOURS and this year's LIGHTS OUT. But it's with ARRIVAL that shows how skillful Heisserer really is, and I think it's time we finally give him the credit he deserves... I guess having Denis Villeneuve direct your script and Amy Adams deliver a powerhouse performance doesn't hurt either.With that said, I went into the film viewing it on a level most others wouldn't have until their second viewing. Despite knowing where the story was headed, the film remained compelling and emotionally involving throughout its runtime, and I cried buckets by the end of it. ARRIVAL is a thoughtful, poignant, and heady piece of work. It respects the audience's intelligence to put the pieces together themselves and involves themes regarding humanity and compassion that's very relevant, especially in the past few days. Overall, Denis Villeneuve continues to deliver stellar work, Amy Adams' subtle but captivating performance will move you, and Eric Heisserer proves to the world everyone should be paying attention to him.",10,4,15,16 November 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.
","Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner.I've heard much about this movie. I've heard great things about this movie; wait, scratch that. I've heard brilliant things about this movie (considering that this is #2 on the top 250 list in IMDb). I didn't really expect much from this movie because of the long running time and that this film (I thought) was about redemption. Boy, did it blow me away!It didn't blow me away as far as people have been blown like a huge tornado have wrecked the country. It had blown me away like a strong wind would've knocked me down. It wasn't all that great (like a masterpiece) but it was an extremely satisfying film.The performances in here were pretty much rock solid as far as playing two men in jail can go. The score was indeed very pleasing to one's ears. What else to say? Oh, the story may feel dark but there are some points where there are some light-heartedness and comedic scenes.This film won me over. It pretty much won everyone over with it's great story and heart. Overall, as I said, it was extremely satisfying to watch from beginning to end. It didn't drag a bit even for a two and almost a half hour film. Watch it and you'll be blown away; but not as much as many others have been.",9,0,1,22 December 2007
The Conjuring," James Wan Takes Things Old School
","'The Conjuring' is a film that knows it's scary. Right from the start, the orchestra plays violently in the background while the ominous logos of WB and New Line appear on screen, much like the opening of 'Insidious.' So are the filmmakers cocky or confident? With a film this well made, does it even matter? One thing I know for sure is this: 'The Conjuring' is one of the most impressive horror films I've seen in awhile.With his directorial debut of 'Saw' back in 2004, James Wan has since improved as a filmmaker, although faltering from 'Dead Silence' and 'Death Sentence.' 'Insidious' was a noticeable improvement, but darn the second half of that film. Now, with 'The Conjuring,' it seems like Wan has found his sweet spot, even though it does embark on familiar territory with 'Insidious' and other horror films made in the past like 'The Exorcist' and 'The Amityville Horror.' The similarities the film shares with 'Insidious' is particularly apparent and slightly disappointing, from certain plot points and even down to some of its characters. However, unlike 'Insidious,' the film actually does get better in the second half. 'The Conjuring' is also the most recent horror film in memory that puts a lot of attention to its characters. The film takes much effort to make the characters feel like people, not expendable pieces of meat to higher the body count.For example, there are five daughters in this film, each with their different personalities, and you will be able to tell the difference between every one of them. By doing so, you truly care for the characters when they're in danger. It also helps that you have talented actors to play these roles, especially the female leads, Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor. Farmiga plays a character who is empathetic with an emotionally wounded past, but that plot point is so understated that it brings a sort of dignity to her role. Taylor is equally as impressive, if not more so than Farmiga, as the motherly figure. In one very effective scene, she may bring a tear to your eye.'The Conjuring' doesn't set out to do anything groundbreaking, but the familiar tricks it does, it does really well. While nothing new, what sets the film apart from most other horror films is the restraint. 'Less is more' is the motto here, and some of the film's best scares are those where you see nothing. The way the story plays out is also very unexpected, with a structure that probably hasn't been done in other horror films before due to the ensemble cast (there are 11 people in the house at one point). It was a risky move to have such a large cast, but it worked out wonderfully. However, to play 'The Conjuring' up as the 'scariest movie ever' is silly and does the film injustice. Is the film scary? What's 'scary' is subjective. I personally wouldn't get nightmares over it, but there are some great scares in here. Regardless, horror films rarely come as good and beautifully crafted as 'The Conjuring,' which is why it should be seen.",8,5,12,17 July 2013
Scream," A Cut Above the Rest
","I've seen SCREAM many times over the years, but I'm now realizing for the first time just how amazing, clever, and tightly-plotted the third act is. The way screenwriter Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven handles the various characters and where they're located with respect to each other while all hell breaks loose is like seeing a magical balancing act that could crash and burn at any time. After all, it's hard for anyone to die in a slasher if everyone sticks together in a big group, and it seems like having the third act take place at a big party is setting up the film for failure. But Williamson and Craven somehow finds reasonable avenues to break the characters away from each other instead of having them split up that's typical of these movies. Overall, it's easy to hate on SCREAM while watching it in today's climate, but the film is handled with a lot of class, intellect, and reverence that's still absent in many of today's horror flicks. Because of that, SCREAM remains, to this day, a cut above the rest.",9,0,0,26 October 2016
Despicable Me," It's so fluffy I'm gonna die!
","Gru delights in all things wicked. Armed with his arsenal of shrink rays, freeze rays, and battle-ready vehicles for land and air, he vanquishes all who stand in his way. Until the day he encounters the immense will of three little orphaned girls who look at him and see something that no one else has ever seen: a potential Dad. The world's greatest villain has just met his greatest challenge: three little girls named Margo, Edith and Agnes. (Universal Pictures)DESPICABLE ME is a film that reminds us that it's okay to have an animated film that can be watched as nothing more than entertainment. It doesn't have the heavy handed themes of death and moving on like in TOY STORY 3 nor is it profound and enlightening like many Pixar films are. But that doesn't make the film bad. It's just light-hearted entertainment for the whole family to enjoy. When is that ever a crime?The film sports an *gasp* original premise and succeeds mostly due to Ken Daurio's clever and comedic script. The characters are also very lovable. Steve Carell is excellent as Gru, the main character. He provides an excellent Russian accent and gives the character a big heart. Still, I felt that they could have done more with Jason Segel, Russell Brand, and especially Kristen Wiig. These actors are comedic gold and their characters ended up to be more underwhelming than hilarious. However, the minions stole the show, providing some of the film's biggest laughs. They were so cute! And speaking of cute, Agnes is my favorite character. She was so adorable.I saw the film in 3D, and I have to say it was really good. It's used in both the gimmicky and subtle way, which I thought helped the film. Overall, it's nowhere near as good as TOY STORY 3 and HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, both brilliant films. However, it's a really sweet film that just melts your heart. Parents should really take their kids to see it because you could do a lot worse. Watch the film if you want to have fun for an hour and a half.",7,3,6,24 July 2010
Back to the Future Part II," Better than the Original!
","The second part of the trilogy begins as Doc, Marty and Jennifer take the time-traveling DeLorean into the year 2015 to straighten out the future of the McFly family. But Biff Tannen steals the time machine and gives his younger self a book containing 50 years of sports statistics, which the young Biff uses to amass an enormous gambling fortune and transform idyllic Hill Valley into a living hell. To restore the present, Doc and Marty must return to the events of their previous adventure in 1955 and retrieve the book.It may be quite obvious that this film had a bigger budget than the first film. The visuals are much more extensive and great! And this is the best movie out of the trilogy! Why? Unlike the first and third films, the second is not only the most complicated, but probably one of the most complicated time travel movie I've ever seen! This movie surly makes you think! I loved it!It goes back and forth with bumps and bruises (which is a good thing). Also, I love the way how it was like 'Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban'. You see dopplegangers and characters trying to hide themselves.This film is much more exciting and you have tons of fun!All in all, as I said, it is the best in the trilogy. Maybe I'm one of the few who thinks that. I'm sure the first is always the best but if you really want a mind bender (where it really makes you think a whole lot), this will blow you away!",8,0,0,27 December 2007
1408," No one lasts more than an hour
","Based on the short Stephen King horror story of the same name, 1408 surrounds supernatural writer Mike Enslin, an author of two hit books focusing on supernatural phenomena. As research for his latest book, Enslin is determined to check out the notorious room 1408 in a New York City hotel by personally staying as a guest in the fabled room. With the intention that 1408 is just a myth perpetuated by stories and rumor that Enslin has collected for his past works. However, hotel manager Mr. Olin has strong objections to Enslin's stay and only warns him of possible danger to come. But Enslin is determined to go through and convinced that the horrific past of 1408 is just mere coincidence and a myth. But what Mike Enslin is about to experience is no myth, as 1408 truly is a room where the guests don't lasts more than an hour.When I was watching the trailer of the film, I was so excited because it looked so intense and thrilling. Then it turned out to be PG-13, which got me disappointed. Well, a PG-13 horror film with an intense trailer must be great, right? Right. It's rare for me to like a horror film or a PG-13 horror film. There are so many torture porn released these days that this film saved the day.It's more like a psychological thriller rather than a horror, in the vein of The Twilight Zone and The Sixth Sense. Instead of buckets or gore and guts, this film is rather creepy and unsettling with it's classic scares and great sound work. I mean, it's a loud, LOUD movie. I love the dark atmosphere and the claustrophobic feel of the film.The look of the film is fantastic, with an 80s feel. This film is (although not as scary as I thought) scary and not many films can scare me. It's more suspense than scary. There is excellent writing throughout the film with solid performances mostly by John Cusack (not to mention Mary McCormack and Samuel L. Jackson). I love the creepy score and cinematography of the film.This is a film that you wouldn't expect to go deep through the emotions. It's the fear of losing someone that makes this film good. It's rather heartbreaking. Mikael Håfström directed this film also directed Derailed (Well, I also liked that film) and is a fine film to add to his collection.With great sound work, solid performances, and great writing, this is one of the few surprises this summer. You don't want to see another big budget action fest? Well, check in to room 1408 and enjoy the scare.",8,2,4,23 June 2007
Step Up," Every second chance begins with a first step.
","The film follows the tale of the disadvantaged Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) and the privileged modern dancer Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan), who find themselves paired up in a showcase that determines both of their futures. Realizing that they only have one chance, they finally work together.So, this is one of fifty million other dance movies released a few years ago. But this movie has a twist: there's a new dancing style! If you wonder why people keep making dance movies, there are always new dancing moves from each new dancing movies. People really go to see dancing films to see the dance sequences and not the plot, and I won't blame them for that.Obviously, the highlight of this film, along with several other dance films, are the dancing sequences. I must say, they're really above average. I would say the score is also very good. Now for the plot, you are right if you think it's predictable and clichéd.Other than that, there's no reason to see or not to see this film. If you want to, go. If not, don't go. You won't gain or lose anything from it. I say, if you watch this movie for the dance, watch it. If you watch this movie for the plot, you'll be disappointed.",4,0,1,2 February 2008

Yes, I said masterpieces! I loved this movie! Not only it's good with the heart and humor for everyone to see, it also has a great story, which many animation films does not.This film is a very funny movie. It has great action scenes, although it won't beat Pixar's animation. This film has its own originality. That's how much I loved this film! Of course I can't say anything about the cast, but Eddie Murphy does make this film hilarious!With anything you want in a great movie, Shrek is one of a few which should be remembered in the past.

X-Men: First Class," Before he was Professor X, he was Charles. Before he was Magneto, he was Erik.
","X-Men: First Class, following the classic Marvel mythology, charts the epic beginning of the X-Men saga. Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-Men. (20th Century Fox)FIRST CLASS is a bit of a disappointing film. The end result is that of a 'meh' because it's a step up from WOLVERINE and THE LAST STAND, which isn't saying much, but it's nowhere near as great as X2. With its potential, FIRST CLASS could have been so much better than it turned out to be. The main flaw of the film is that it tells an origin story which in itself makes the film less interesting to watch because we're only waiting to see inevitable consequences resulting in what we already saw in the first X-Men film. It's like STAR WARS 3. Sure, it's cool to see things connect to the trilogy, but we expected that in the first place.Being an origin story also means we have to go through the process of learning each character all over again which means a huge chunk of the film would be devoted to exposition. This could be interesting, and parts of it are, including a touching romance that develops between Raven (Mystique) and Hank (Beast). The addition of newer characters should also make this less tedious than it should be, but, like the previous X-Men films, there are just too many characters to fully develop each of them. Even with a long running time of over two hours, most of them are left in the dust, including the villains and professor Xavier himself. Still, director Matthew Vaughn tries his best to balance the many characters in this film, although not fully succeeding.Many people will argue that the other characters don't matter since it focuses more on the relationship between Charles (Professor X) and Erik (Magneto). Unfortunately, even that isn't as fully developed as we want it to be. The problem is that the relationship is portrayed so much better by the two older actors in the trilogy, played by Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, that we yearn for them to appear on screen together again. There is, however, one scene in which I felt the emotional connection between these two characters, which involves a satellite, and it's a sweet but short scene. The film also hints on the themes that were explored in the trilogy, but that doesn't do much good because they are only touched upon and are more interesting when we see them play out in the trilogy.Another thing they could have made more interesting or changed altogether was the story dealing with the missile crisis. It's simply not interesting or compelling to watch. Even the climax in which the story really comes into play is as exciting as watching a kids race. It had little to do with the mutants themselves and more to do with stopping a nuclear war and, because of that, I didn't find myself caring much. The main villain, played by Kevin Bacon, isn't all that memorable either. He's very 2 dimensional with a bland super power. Again, we yearn a time in which the villain was McKellen's Magneto, who's more complex and interesting than Bacon's character will ever be.I must say that James McAvoy is miscasted as Charles Xavier. As stated earlier, he's not developed well in here and his role is mainly to help and find more mutants. There's not much for him to do than his character truly deserves. Michael Fassbender, on the other hand, plays a fierce and compelling Magneto, saying his lines with conviction and bringing great emotional weight to his character. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique is another noteworthy name among the cast who brings a soft and sweet side to her character. I also liked Nicholas Hoult as Beast. Everyone else, including January Jones and Jason Flemyng (who's like a Nightcrawler 2.0), are pretty forgettable. Saying all of that, the film does include some great action scenes, for the few that are in here, with terrific special effects. The soundtrack by Henry Jackman should have been toned down quite a bit though.With all the problems listed above, FIRST CLASS is not a bad film. It's just an incredibly flawed one with nostalgia that only reminds us of the better, older actors in the trilogy. However, there are some intelligent aspects from the script, and the film does offer a few shining and emotional moments that go far and beyond many superhero films before, including the lackluster THOR and the dumb INCREDIBLE HULK. Even if I sounded like I'm being hard on this film, I'm doing so on purpose because I can see the great that can come out of it. Overall, FIRST CLASS ends up being my second favorite in the series, even ahead the first film (which I thought was only decent) but behind X2. With all the set up in this prequel (much like X-MEN is to X2), I do believe that a FIRST CLASS PART II could make this prequel series reach its potential and hopefully not disappoint us with a FIRST CLASS PART III like THE LAST STAND did. 6.5/10",7,0,3,3 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," The Legend Ends
","To this day, the only Batman films I've ever enjoyed are the ones made by Christopher Nolan. In fact, the original quadrilogy bores me. What makes Nolan's films so special is that he is able to expand the concept of what a superhero film can be without making it unbelievable. Whether or not you like Nolan's Batman films, they have already become sources of huge inspiration for many filmmakers. BATMAN BEGINS is fantastic and THE DARK KNIGHT is even better. Therefore, the main question people will ask during this film is 'How can this top TDK?,' and the answer is apparent: It can't. I don't even think that it's better than BATMAN BEGINS, but that doesn't make TDKR bad. No doubt, TDKR is a fantastic end to a lovely trilogy that will be cherished by many people in the coming future, but it isn't without its faults.As with most sequels, TDKR tries to top its last two predecessors. For Hollywood, this usually means making everything bigger and grander, and this applies to Nolan. Yes, everything is much more epic in TDKR, from the bombastic score by Hans Zimmer to the even darker tone to the new collection of characters and to the many story lines that come with them. This brings several problems to the film: It makes TDKR unnecessarily convoluted, and there's a lack of narrative cohesion. It would be better had the film dropped some subplots. In particular, there is a romance between Bruce Wayne and Miranda Tate that really comes out of nowhere with no development leading up to it at all. Tate could have been a friend of Wayne, and the story would still work. The first half is also pretty choppy and a bit uninteresting as it essentially sets everything up.It isn't until the second half that TDKR really shines. The story slowly starts to pick up momentum, and everything starts to work like clockwork, all leading up to a stunning climax. Despite a questionable plot twist, the third act is noticeably more exciting than the ones from BATMAN BEGINS and TDK. Likewise, the last 10 minutes is one of the most emotionally satisfying conclusions ever put on film. It shook me, and had there been no audience members in the theater with me, I would have bawled like a baby. On top of that, Nolan seems to have a firmer grip on the action scenes, which are shot and cut more skillfully than his previous attempts.Christian Bale has already owned the role as Batman, as with Gary Oldman as the lovable Commissioner Gordon, but let's talk about Michael Caine. He is such a great actor, and the few key scenes he appears in TDKR remain to be some of the highlights of the film. Additionally, there are many new actors aboard the film, including Tom Hardy as Bane. Hardy looks unrecognizable and he pulls off a menacing performance, although some of his dialogue is unfortunately lost through his mask. It's clear, though, that the late Heath Ledger as The Joker was a much better villain, elevating TDK to a considerable level. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great as a young cop, but it's Anne Hathaway who manages to surprise, playing Catwoman. She is appropriately cunning and sexy at the same time, and there is little camp in her performance which is a plus.As you can see, TDKR has a lot of flaws. At times, the film can be a little too bleak, murky, and slow. However, all these flaws add up to very little when compared to the film as a whole. It's a summer film that probes the mind. To say the film isn't perfect is obvious, but TDKR is a masterful, harrowing, and epic conclusion to the Dark Knight trilogy, filled with symbolism, themes, and allegory. Because of that, the film is great, flaws and all.",8,2,8,24 July 2012
Iron Man," I Am Iron Man
","The film is about Tony Stark, a billionaire industrialist who is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan. Ordered to build a missile for them, Stark uses his resources instead to build a powered exoskeleton to make his escape. Returning to the United States, Stark improves his armor and becomes the technologically advanced superhero Iron Man.'Iron Man' officially kicks off the summer blockbuster event and it should, because the movie is really good and it really sets up the bar high, as if challenging the upcoming summer movies to be as good or better than this. It's better than some superhero movies that came out before and certainly better than most movies coming out these days. What makes 'Iron Man' different than most superhero films is that it doesn't start the action right away. In fact, Iron Man doesn't appear until the last half hour of the film and that's a good thing.Maybe some may be disappointed by the fact it doesn't have as much action as some action films but many will appreciate the characters more. Going into this movie, many people, including myself, are iffy about Robert Downey Jr. playing a superhero character, but once you see this movie, you'll know why he fits the character well. In fact, as far as I am concern, he's perfect for the role. His charisma just brings the movie out a bit more. Gwyneth Paltrow is also really good. Downey Jr. and Paltrow both have fun in their roles and even in scenes with them together are funner to watch.The action scenes, when they appear, they are so much fun to see. The visuals are fantastic and the CGI clean and crisp. However, I do think that the reveal for the 'villain' is pretty obvious and there are some plot holes in here, which I think are forgettable. Director Jon Favreau does a great job in the storytelling. It's no doubt that he is a great filmmaker. If you're not a fan of Iron Man, don't worry. This film is great for the whole family, fans, and non-fans. And stay through the credits. You'll get an extra scene in the end. This is the movie to see this summer.",8,1,4,3 May 2008

Originally in retirement, he is forced to re-enter the force when six replicants escape from an offworld colony to Earth.I watched this movie with an expectation. A high expectation. A really high one. I heard such words like 'classic,' 'amazing,' and 'brilliant.' I also watched this movie with a mindset. In my mind, I intended this film to be an action thriller type of film. Well, when I saw the movie, I hated it.It's probably those two reasons why I didn't like it. I found it so dull, boring, and slow-paced -- really not what I have intended in mind. The whole film felt like an art piece instead of a movie. It's like a BS message type film, as if it was 'robots have feelings too' type of message.This film isn't for everyone. You'll either love it or hate it and I really hated it. Some will admire it as an excellent piece of art while others will hate it for not explaining much and leaving everything ambiguous and opened. Well, I will praise this film for the excellent look and visual effects, but that's about it. I really did not get what the point of the film was. It went all over the place.Harrison Ford's performance was also a let down. Expecting this to be an action film, I expected Ford to be an action hero, as he is always portrayed in action films he starred in. However, his character in here is old, retired, and just not into anymore action. Sheesh! Watch it if you want to but I will say that people who would like to see a film that has a resolution in the end with a coherent story to not expect much from this. As for others, enjoy the visuals.",6,2,10,11 May 2008
Bruce Almighty," A Funny Film
","Bruce Nolan is a guy who hates his life. He has so much bad luck that he blames God for it. God has had enough of his rants so he decides to give Bruce his powers to teach him how difficult it really is to run a world.Bruce is a news reporter. He is desperate to get the job for head anchor at the TV station. So the manager decides to gives him a live news report. During the live report, Bruce founds out he doesn't get his job so he loses his cool on live TV which gets him fired. Bruce even tries to help a poor homeless guy and he gets beat up by a bunch of hoodlums. That's probably why he blames God.Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston delivers good performances. Jennifer Aniston is an underrated actress. Morgan Freeman gives a great performance playing God, himself. He has some of the greatest lines in this films.This film is funny. Very enjoyable. One of the great things about the film is that it gives an important message. Individuals, like you, can improve their life. This film is not very religious. Many won't be offended.This tends to be the more memorable comedies. It's a great comedy great for the family. Jim Carrey is very funny. Filled with great performances, a meaningful message, this is a film not to miss. It's worth watching.",8,0,2,4 December 2006
Casino Royale," The First Bond Film...
","This film is about James Bond's first mission to stop Le Chiffre, a corrupt banker, from winning a high-stakes poker tournament and using the prize money to pay back threatening terrorists who lost money because of Le Chiffre.I believe this is the first film in the Bond series and it's the second Bond film I've seen so I wouldn't know what to say if it's the best or not. I'm not typically a Bond fan but my dad is, which is why I saw this in theaters.I wasn't that excited as seeing this movie as other movies but this film is very good. I wasn't very surprised because almost everyone said it was good.And as everyone knows, there's a new Bond, Daniel Craig. His acting plus others, including Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, and Judi Dench, are very good. And Daniel Craig does much better stunts than Pierce Brosnan which makes the movie more exciting.This being the first film, the famous line wouldn't appear until the end of the film, as so as the theme song. The credit sequence in the beginning of the film is very interesting, tied to Die Another Day. This film is a tad too long, running in about 2 hours and 30 minutes.In my opinion, Daniel Craig is a much better Bond actor than Brosnan. This film makes your heart beat fast and it's one of the best films of this year. If you're a Bond fan, then you'll certainly love this film.",9,0,1,23 December 2006
Toy Story 3," No toy gets left behind.
","Toy Story 3 is a comical new adventure in Disney Digital 3D that lands the toys in a room full of untamed tots who can't wait to get their sticky little fingers on these 'new' toys. It's pandemonium as they try to stay together, ensuring 'no toy gets left behind.' Meanwhile, Barbie comes face to plastic face with Ken (yes, that Ken). (Disney, Pixar)The third movie curse. Time and time again have shown us that the third film of every trilogy is always the weakest of the bunch, and it's usually true. However, since this is PIXAR we're talking about, TOY STORY 3 is a huge exception (emphasis on the word 'huge'). In fact, I'll go further and say that TOY STORY 3 is the best in the trilogy, by far. Unlike most PIXAR films, the first two Toy Story films never try to be profound. They have always been about it's lovable, plastic, toy characters portraying true, human emotions and that's what makes them so brilliant to begin with!TOY STORY 3 is no different. We see our beloved characters return to the silver screen again for their last adventure, and it's a big one. The story also carries more weight. Like SHREK FOREVER AFTER, there's a lot at stake compared to the previous films, so much so that the characters' lives are at risk, which is appropriate, considering this is the last film and all. Although the darkest of the bunch (you'd be surprised how much PIXAR could squeeze into this G-rated flick), the film manages to perfectly blend the dark moments with light-hearted moments. In fact, TOY STORY 3 is hilarious, filled with witty jokes and perfect comedic timing from the toys! The toys!The story is well written, thanks to Michael Arndt, who also wrote the script for LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. It's different from the previous PIXAR films in a way that there is a lot of suspense and excitement going on. In fact, there's a sequence in the third act that had me on the edge of my seats and crying at the same time! How that sequence alone could pass the MPAA's G-rated standards is beyond my knowledge. The film also gets its try at the horror genre, and I have to admit, they are legitimately scary.As said before, most of our characters return, although some, most notably Bo Peep, are not to be seen, which is kinda depressing for me. However, we get to meet some new characters along the way, my favorite being Ken, Barbie's love interest. He's such a fantastic, colorful character and he provides most of the film's funniest jokes. I also liked Trixie, the new dinosaur, although she was underused in the film. Oh, and I loved what the filmmakers did to Buzz Lightyear. I'm not going to spoil it but it's very funny.What brings this film on a level far greater than the first two films is the theme of being able to let go, which us movie goers will also have to go through when watching the film and because of this, it reaches a deeper emotional depth than ever before. I guarantee that you will cry in this film and if you don't, you might as well be a robot. The animation is also substantially better than the previous two films' already impeccable animation, showing how far even Pixar's technology has advanced.As a send off to the series, TOY STORY 3 can't be any more perfect, especially the last scene. The opening sequence alone is worth the price of admission just because it brings back the nostalgia from the two previous films. The film is filled with suspense, romance, adventure, horror, comedy, and, let's not forget, heart. While other movie studios try to release good films (yeah, right), PIXAR is the only movie studio that has gotten all 100% of their films right. See this film not because it's the last time we may see these characters. See it because it's a cinematic masterpiece, an end of a golden era. It's the best film of the year so far. Let's hope a TOY STORY film finally receives the Oscar it deserved fifteen years ago.It should also be noted that the short that appears before this film, DAY & NIGHT, is bloody brilliant. The short is so original, so wonderful, so mind blowing that it's an obvious Oscar contender for Best Short. I'm still awestruck at how original the short is.",10,3,6,19 June 2010
Signs," Best M. Night Film So Far!
","After the death of his wife in a freak accident, Reverend Graham Hess questions his faith and even leaves the church. Six months later, he discovers a gigantic crop circle in his yard. Similar events happen all over the world. Graham's children think it's aliens, his brother thinks it's pranksters, and Graham doesn't know what to think. However, as more and more strange events occur, he realizes something big is coming, and it's probably not going to be friendly.I would simply love to say this is one of the best science fiction film and one of the best films ever made. It's a masterpiece. It's brilliant. I loved every minute of it. From one of the best title sequences ever made to the ending. First of all, this is not a CGI blockbuster. I mean, literally, there are a few action scenes in this film, abnormal for an alien invasion film. I love the idea! it's original and the story is more about the family and what they are going through.The film's score is great! This is probably James Newton Howard's best work he has ever done! The music provides something mysterious and obviously give homages to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Psycho. I also love the simplicity of the film. There's nothing too complex right here. Everything is just there in front of the screen while you go in 'awe'.I also liked the camera-work done. Another great thing from this is the use of suspense and tension. The first time I've ever seen this (I've seen this movie many times already), it made me crap my pants and I'm not usually scared in movies. In this movie, less is certainly more. Each information is given off little by little until the big finale.I liked the subtle humor in this film. It's certainly not laugh-out-loud funny but it's great to laugh when you're filled with suspense. Mel Gibson's performance is fantastic as well as Joaquin Phoenix. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin were good too.This film is certainly underrated. Most people didn't like it for the twist ending or the overall conclusion of the movie. It's not that bad, really. It's ridiculous that they don't like the movie for that reason. I even liked this better than The Sixth Sense! This is why people make movies! This film is not just another alien invasion movie. It has many underlying themes to those who want to look deeper into the film.It has a fantastic script, brilliant score, terrific performances, great camera-work, extremely underrated, and is one of the best films ever made! I loved it that much! Do not go into this movie thinking of a CGI-filled film (although it has a $70 million budget) because it's trying to be much more than that.",9,3,10,26 June 2007
Identity," Clever Movie
","There are basically two plots in this film: One is that 11 people are stuck in a motel because of a rainstorm. These are the 11 people: a limo driver escorting a movie star, parents with a young son, a cop transporting a convict, a prostitute, a young couple, and a motel manager. Then they get killed one by one. One of the 11 people is the killer but who? The other story revolves a psychiatrist who is trying to prove the innocence of a man accused of murder in an eleventh hour trial. Both these story will create a twist at the end that would leave you speechless. Well, maybe not.This is an ingenious horror thriller with many plot twists and surprises. The beginning is quite clever where the camera stops at one point and goes to the past to show you what happens. The way the people are in the motel feels claustrophobic. No cellphones work and no cars will go over the flooded roads. This isn't a brilliant thriller but it's good enough to be a great movie.John Cusack's and Amanda Peet's acting are great. This is an intelligent thriller so you might need the brains to understand the twist. Well, maybe not. It's quite easy to follow, really. Although the twist might not be satisfying for some, it is really satisfying for me.This is a great thriller. I've seen many and this one is unique. It keeps you guessing until the end and you'll be shocked. Go watch it!",8,0,2,18 March 2006
Beowulf," Director's Cut Review
","In 507, a monstrous troll wrecks havoc in the mead hall of the Danish king, Hrothgar. He offers rewards for the death of Grendel, so Beowulf, a great and boastful Geet warrior, arrives with his thanes. Beowulf sets aside his armor and awaits the monster; a fierce battle ensues that leads to Beowolf's entering the watery lair of Grendel's mother, where a devil's bargain awaits. Beowulf returns to Herot, the castle, and becomes king. Jump ahead many years, and the sins of the father are visited upon Beowulf and his kingdom. The hero must face his weakness and be heroic once again. Is the age of demons over?Note: I saw this film on a small TV screen with no 3D glasses. First of all, I did not find this movie exhilarating and fun as many people put it out to be. It's probably because they saw it in a movie theater with 3D glasses! Oh, how I would kill to watch this movie in IMAX 3D! However, I didn't so it didn't really get me.Second, the story wasn't at all interesting. It's just basically a hero trying to kill monsters. Wow....so exciting. Third, the movie wasn't as entertaining and fun as I thought it would be. The action scene are decent at best. Fourth, this whole motion capture thing is good, but animation still do not look as real as the real thing. In some moments, I believed some things were real while in others, I thought it was complete crappy animation so that kind of took me out of the movie.Fifth, I've seen so many other movies before this that uses the same action scenes used in this film, like 300 and Alexander. In the end, I thought the film was decent for what it was. I've never read the play or was familiar with anything from Beowulf, but as an outsider, I guess it would be okay to kill 117 minutes...",4,0,1,9 April 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Terrific Action-Packed Entertainment!
","In the past few years, the aging John McClane has managed to get divorced from his wife Holly and become estranged from his daughter Lucy, but still remains with the NYPD. On his way to turn a young hacker named Matt Farrell into custody, he experiences a modern version of a terrorist attack first hand when he gets stuck in traffic. A group of hackers, led by Thomas Gabriel, have struck at the vulnerable United States computer infrastructure and are systematically shutting it down, performing a 'firesale' beginning with the traffic light system.As they move on to crash utilities, banking networks and the stock market, the indexes plummet and America's economy becomes crippled. As usual, McClane gets caught up in the middle of the excitement. It turns out that the recently captured Matt seems bright enough to understand exactly what the terrorists are doing and what steps they are taking to achieve their mission. Soon, the crime-fighting duo of McClane and Farrell are pulling out all the stops and matching wits with the terrorists, hoping to figure out the motives behind their actions and to stop them before the entire nation collapses to its knees on Independence Day.I wasn't really looking forward to this film because I've never seen any Die Hard films or really wasn't interested seeing them. Well, I finally got to see Die Hard for the first time and I liked (not loved) it. Then I find out this movie was rated PG-13, which got me excited and let down at the same time. I knew they wouldn't say the line in the movie but I was excited because it might be good to see something different for a change.So it was late when I saw this in theaters but wow, when I saw this film, I did not get sleepy for a second! I didn't even bother to look at what time it was. This movie was so entertaining and action-packed, it was so much better than the original! Well, this is coming from a person who haven't seen the second or third Die Hard films, so my opinion might be different than the others. Yeah, it didn't feel like a Die Hard film but it certainly did give references to the original. If you watch this film, it will feel like an R rated film. It really does. Yeah, you don't get much profanity but you wouldn't be thinking about it when watching the movie. I never liked Len Wiseman's Underworld but I'm glad to say I love this movie!Now getting the rating controversy out of the way, I'll talk about how fantastic the film is. This film is pretty much a notch up from the original. It has more imaginative/creative ideas to make you go in awe. It is much smarter, much suspenseful, and has many more action sequences that are top notch! I'm glad they used as little CGI as possible because so many films this summer has! It's great to see them doing it the 'old skool' way using real stunts and props. No, I'm not saying this is a better film because of the action, but I'm saying it was better because it basically tops everything off from the original (yeah, except for the language).In this film, John McClane is much more crankier. I loved it! The film was much funnier because of his fantastic one liners and comedic scenes! Bruce Willis' acting is great as always. Justin Long's acting is surprisingly good as well as Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who didn't shine through her previous roles in other films. Timothy Olyphant, who plays the villain gives a realistic evil and sinister role and Maggie Q's performance is kick ass! I'm surprised to say this film is fast paced, even for a two hour movie. I thought it wasn't possible.This film uses what Die Hard didn't. It has a much thrilling score to make the action scenes much suspenseful. The camera movements are great! The film is much funnier and entertaining. This is possibly one of the most surprising summer movie sequel out this year! Average movie goers will get really entertained. Die Hard fans, well, will also get entertained but might get disappointed because of the PG-13 rating, which I wouldn't say they need to worry. This film is a solid action-packed film that delivers!",8,2,5,28 June 2007
The Sixth Sense," I See Dead People
","Child psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe is confronted one night by his former patient Vincent Gray who he failed to help. After Vincent shoots Crowe in the stomach and kills himself, Crowe can't stop thinking about it. A few months later he is hired to help a troubled boy named Cole Sear, who has many of the same problems Vincent had. Crowe sees a chance to redeem himself, but doubts his ability to reach the boy, particularly when Cole claims to see ghosts who don't know they're dead.Right off, I'll say this is one of the best films ever. It currently ranks #3 for M. Night's films. I love this movie because it's a really good ghost story and has a thought-provoking plot.Yeah, this film was famous so I already knew the ending before it even happened but that didn't distract me from watching the movie. Throughout the movie is a masterpiece.The acting by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Toni Collette were all fantastic and some like Olivia Williams and Donnie Wahlberg were all great, too.If you want an intelligent ghost movie with some scares and twists and turns, this is the movie for you. It's not just a plain old stupid scary movie. It has a story and great acting.",10,2,3,25 March 2007
Final Destination," The Plane's Going to Explode!
","Alex and other students are going to a field trip to Paris. They get on the plane. Alex has a bad feeling the plane's going to crash. They take off and the plane starts to shake violently. The lights start to turn on and off and an explosion occurs in the left side of the plane and people fall out of the whole. Then another explosion occurs and burns everyone to death!Alex suddenly wakes up from a vivid dream and the the plane hasn't taken off, yet. He starts to hyperventilate and drags six people out of the plane. Some students get mad because they will have to miss a day in Paris but suddenly, the plane takes off and it explodes, just like Alex's dream. After this event, the seven survivors starts to get killed one by one with freak accidents. Alex and the help of his friend, Clear, has to find out when will Death starts to kill them, next.This is one of your smarter teenage slasher films. No, it's no where like a killer chasing and killing people. But yes, it has a lot of violence. It's Death, in which you can't stop what's happening in part of life. The acting by Devon Sawa and Ali Larter were decent at best.This movie has a very elaborate concept, in which many horror movies do not. The deaths in the movie are even foreshadowed through clues, which makes you want to look for them. You would even have to pay attention to easter eggs, like the fact that before each person dies, the same song is played.Some deaths in the film are good, but many are more of a let down, since you 'might' want them more violent. Still, they are pretty creative. I like the weird score by the composer, which gives a brooding effect through the film.This is a smart but not a scary movie, for me at least. The deaths are good in this movie but they're not great. If you are tired of regular slasher movies where a killer kills people, then watch this movie and you'll like it.",6,0,1,20 June 2006
Munich," An Outstanding Thriller
","This film is about what happened after the Munich Olympics in 1972 where five men are chose to kill those who were responsible for that fateful day.First of all, this is a very violent film. I have never seen these kinds of killings before like actually showing people get shot by many bullets and so on...This is a very suspenseful film. It held me to the edge of my seats and it's one of the best thrillers of this year. The performances by the people hired to kill those who killed these others were great. It took me a while to find out that Daniel Craig was in this film.This is a really gripping and intelligent thriller with outstanding performances and a lot of violence. Although a good film, it's really not the best film of 2005 but it's one of the best.",7,4,6,9 February 2007
A Nightmare on Elm Street," She is the only one who can stop it... if she fails, no one survives.
","A repulsive, decaying figure with razor-sharp appendages suddenly appears in the dreams of four Los Angeles teenagers. It is the ghost of Freddy Krueger, a suspected child murderer killed long ago by the neighborhood parents. Now he's able to exact his bloody vengeance by killing the teens off, one by one, as they sleep. Finally, just one girl remains. Desperately, she tries to stay awake by every means possible, but even pills and massive amounts of coffee wear off sometime and when they do, she'll have to battle Freddy for her very life. It's her worst nightmare...and it's coming true.I would like to apologize firsthand that I'm around 25 years late in seeing this film because I should have seen it a whole lot sooner, but what can I say? Anyway, ANOES is one of those films that could have been a classic with some other horror films if it were not some producers messing around with the director's true vision. Yes, in fact, producer Robert Shaye made director Wes Craven change the ending for this film (which I will certainly not spoil to you in this review). However, I shouldn't be all that scathing to Mr. Shaye because, after all, he was the one who helped Craven bring this project about and without him, we'd probably not have a franchise nor an iconic villain named Freddy Krueger to this day.The film has a very low budget and it could be seen throughout the film through the shoddy visual effects. However, I must admit, Craven knows how to use money because some effects in here seemed like a lot of money to be pulled off. What may seem like $20 million to make is, in reality, only $2 million. With that low of a budget, the film surprisingly pulls a lot of things off. The look of Freddy is quite frightening, I must admit, as opposed of his 'cleaned up' look in the later sequels, with an exception of part 7. The theme is also haunting and very notable to this day.As for the story itself, it's very genius and original. Who would have ever thought of a guy who can kill people in their dreams? It's fantastic! The film does a great job at confusing the audience with dream and reality, one of the key things that makes the series successful and unique to other slasher films. Heather Langenkamp is the heroine in this film. She pulls off a sympathetic role for the audience to root for. Robert Englund plays the iconic villain, Freddy, and plays it perfectly, giving plenty of witty one-liners and scares, sometimes at the same time!But where ANOES starts to fall down the hill is when it gets closer to the third act, where everything goes almost berserk and where many inconsistencies start springing up, where dream and reality cross one another. It's quite confusing. However, I got it after another viewing. But the worst part of the film is the ending. It really is that bad, and bumps the film one or two points. The ending ruins the whole point of the film and I can tell why Craven is angry. Oh, well. At least Craven got success out of it. If you're a horror fan, you must see this film because it has a franchise for a reason.",6,2,3,3 January 2010
The Truman Show," Well...It's Not Bad. It's Not Good Either
","In this movie, Jim Carrey is Truman, a man whose life is a fake one... The place he lives is in fact a big studio with hidden cameras everywhere, and all his friends and people around him, are actors who play their roles in the most popular TV-series in the world: The Truman Show. Truman thinks that he is an ordinary man with an ordinary life and has no idea about how he is exploited. Until one day... he finds out everything. Will he react?HmmmÂ…let me see where to start with this movie. It was weird but wasn't that weird compared to other movies. And it was disappointing. I expected more from this kind of plot. The plot was excellent, but the execution wasn't all that great nor interesting to catch my attention.I was actually quite bored within the first twenty five minutes until the plot started moving. Yeah, it started getting interesting but still, wasn't interesting enough. It felt way too long, for some reason and slightly boring. I really tried to like this movie. I really wanted to but it didn't work for me.The performance by Jim Carrey was good and sometimes funny, giving us a comedic relief. Laura Linney's performance was weird and Noah Emmerich's decent. The cinematography was fresh and original, since it's like Big Brother all over again. There are some surprising plot elements which caught my attention.This was a good movie with a good score but, I expected a little more of an 'oomph'. Some people might not need it and some people might do but either way, it isn't bad. If you want to see Carrey in a serious role, here's the time.",7,1,3,28 July 2007
The Matrix," A Spectacle but More Overrated
","In the near future, a computer hacker named Neo discovers that all life on Earth may be nothing more than an elaborate facade created by a malevolent cyber-intelligence, for the purpose of placating us while our life essence is 'farmed' to fuel the Matrix's campaign of domination in the 'real' world. He joins like-minded Rebel warriors Morpheus and Trinity in their struggle to overthrow the Matrix.I finally got to see this film. Yeah, I'm 11 years late. What can I say? Well, although the IMDb rating for this film is considerably high (never trust their rating system), this film is more mediocre than one of the best films ever made.This film has a really good plot, which shows you how much time these filmmakers brainstormed it. It's just so complex that you want to be more challenged by the plot than you already know. You want more surprises and all of that but you don't.It doesn't bring down some of the best visual effects and action sequences in the film. They are all breathtaking with some memorable scenes I've seen spoofed. The acting by Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss are all good.If you're expecting a big masterpiece, you might (or you might be a fan), but for me, it wasn't all that great as people said it was. Great plot, great action, great visual effects, but its plot falls short.",7,1,3,21 May 2007
Deadpool," This is what it looks like when filmmakers take risks
","Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.",8,614,1034,15 February 2016
300," A Visually Violent Fantastic Film!
","Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, '300' concerns the 480 B.C. Battle of Thermopylae, where the King of Sparta led his army against the advancing Persians; the battle is said to have inspired all of Greece to band together against the Persians, and helped usher in the world's first democracy.Visually, the movie is obviously one of the greatest in movie history, in the vein of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. The action scenes are very well done with the camera-work and has decent special effects. One very good visualized scene is of a woman doing this ritual with smoke and see-through clothes. I got to say, it was pretty very beautiful and mesmerizing.Even better is the storytelling. The story and script of the film is fantastic! The acting by Gerard Butler and Lena Headey are very good. This is actually my first epic film I've ever seen. I still want to watch others like Gladiator, King Arthur, Kingdom of Heaven, Troy, Alexander, and so on. I was pleasantly surprised that the film was very good, one of the year's best so far!I got to admit that the beginning starts off a bit slow. All the action the trailer promises are seen later in the film but you'll get used to it. I thought this was already overrated before seeing this movie but it's not. One thing I was annoyed by were the constant creatures getting larger scene after scene, like a snowball effect. One small creature gets killed and then there are two slightly bigger creatures and then so on and so on.At the end of the film, I wanted to applaud but I didn't want to cause disturbance, especially this one guy who clapped every one or two scenes as people laugh at him. This is an amazing film to watch. Of course the breathtaking CGI and camera-work would worth your ticket to see this movie but the great storytelling is just a great deal!",7,4,10,11 March 2007

","Six different people, each from a very different walk of life, awaken to find themselves inside a giant cube with thousands of possible rooms. Each has a skill that becomes clear when they must band together to get out: a cop, a math whiz, a building designer, a doctor, an escape master, and a disabled man. Each plays a part in their thrilling quest to find answers as to why they've been imprisoned.So for you people who are researching this movie because of 'Saw', I guess it's worth watching. For those who haven't seen 'Saw' but somehow researched this film for some reason, then I guess it's worth watching. I say this for one reason: It might or will determine how you will like or not like the movie.Why? If you have seen films with people waking up and finding themselves being tortured or killed (which probably is what modern horror movies are these days), 'Cube' plays like any of these movies, but it's not fair because this film was made in 1997.This is basically a body count movie with some intelligence. You can see surprises coming far away and the film is mostly suspense-free and the whole film basically follows a pattern: Room, room, surprise, kill, room, room surprise kill, math room, room, more math, math, room, kill, surprise, math, math, room, room, etc.See, I might have liked this movie more if I haven't seen any movies that are related to this one. Now I have to admit there were some surprising moments and one tense scene, but I really did not find this movie any different than what we see today in horror movies. Also, the performances by the ensemble is decent.Like I said, if you have seen no movies related to this, this is worth watching. If not, there's nothing new here.",5,0,4,25 September 2007
Apollo 13," A Great Inspiring Film
","Astronauts Lovell, Haise and Swigert are on Apollo 13. People aren't worried about this expedition because the people already made it to the moon safely and had came back alive. That's not the point when things go very wrong and the hopes of coming back alive starts to fade.This is a very good film. It shows human dedication and perseverance that they won't give up, even though hopes from other people seems to increase.The acting by Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, and Kathleen Quinlan are all great. This film also delivers some of the best lines in movie history.This is a true story and has turned into a great movie and has great acting. Although I wouldn't say it's the best film, it's still one of the best films.",8,25,36,27 January 2007
Fantastic Four," Extended Cut Review
","When an experimental space voyage goes awry, four people are changed by cosmic rays. Reed Richards, inventor and leader of the group gains the ability to stretch his body, and takes the name, Mr. Fantastic. His girlfriend, Sue Storm, gains the ability to turn invisible and create force fields, calling herself the Invisible Woman. Her younger brother Johnny Storm gains the ability to control fire, including covering his own body with flame, becoming the Human Torch. Pilot Ben Grimm is turned into a super-strong rock creature calling himself Thing. Together, they use their unique powers to explore the strange aspects of the world, and to foil the evil plans of Doctor Doom.What I didn't like from the theatrical cut of the film was that the pacing was way too fast, which didn't leave any room for character development and other important element. Now that TWENTY MINUTES are added back in this extended cut, this film was a LOT better. I'm pretty surprised my rating has gone up from 6/10 to 9/10!I love that this version has more character development and emotion to enhance the film when it was totally panned by critics. Who knows. If this cut was released, it might have made better reviews. I'm also surprised there weren't that many action scenes, although I really did not mind it.The CGI effects are really great in the film, as well as the action scenes. There are some funny bits here and there, mainly from the character, Johnny Storm. It's just your average entertaining family movie!I liked the acting by the main four heroes, including Jessica Alba (I don't know why people hated her in this movie). I also find it quite refreshing from Chris Evans' acting. His character doesn't act serious, like many superhero does.Do not compare this from Batman Begins or Spider-Man. I might include this in the 'best superhero movies ever made' list because it's just good with its characters as with its story. This is Fantastic 4 everyone! Watch it now (the extended cut)!",8,0,2,8 June 2007
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," It all begins ... With a choice
","Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger as Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge. In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob — knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her graduation quickly approaching, Bella is confronted with the most important decision of her life. (Summit Entertainment)Once the opening scene is over and the title appears with Howard Shore's epic soundtrack playing in the background, you know that ECLIPSE is going to be good. Unlike NEW MOON, there's actually SOMETHING happening in here! There are characters DOING things, which is something more I can say for the previous sequel. And because the film has a very interesting plot akin to a horror film, ECLIPSE is easily the most exciting and cinematic film in the series!But just because there is a body count doesn't rule it out as a romance. Yes, the romance is still here. Yes, there is still the love triangle. Yes, Bella still has to choose between Edward and Jacob. But all of this is not as bad and tedious as you might think mostly due to Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay. This time around, she decides to add clever lines and something called humor into the romance. For example, in one scene, Edward asks Bella about Jacob, 'Doesn't he have a shirt?' It's little scenes like these that make the love story a lot less cheesy and more welcoming compared to the first two films which everything was so serious they could pass for soap operas.Like the HARRY POTTER series, it's interesting to see different styles from the many directors that are attached for each film. With David Slade now on the directing chair, the film is improved with a much tighter direction and a faster pace. With experience from the horror genre, Slade knows how to create exciting action sequences. In fact, Slade pulls no punches in the climatic battle scene(s). Honestly, you get your money's worth. Who knew a TWILIGHT film would have the most beheadings in a PG-13 film? Honestly, there were some really brutal scenes.The cast is still good but more mature in their roles. Kristen Stewart gives a wonderful performance as always. I also liked Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner, especially in one scene where they get to spew out clever dialogue at one another about how they're the better man for Bella. Anna Kendrick, who had her rise of fame in UP IN THE AIR last year, doesn't appear much in the film, unfortunately, but it's always great to see her when she does, including one important scene. Billy Burke is still the same great father we saw him in the previous two films.Most of the Cullen clan have considerably more to do in this sequel, most notably Jackson Rathbone. There are even origin stories on two of them, both of which are very interesting while one of them is eerily similar to Bill Compton's in TRUE BLOOD. Xavier Samuel plays the new villain and he gives a menacing performance. Bryce Dallas Howard replaces Rachelle Lefevre as the new Victoria and she does a good job as well, although she's underused.Even the visual effects are improved! I didn't know how they did it, but the sparkling skin on Edward is suddenly not laughable anymore. I also liked the look of the CGI wolves and their interactions with the actors. There's one scene with Bella petting Jacob in his transformation and it looked believable. Oh, and it's great to listen to Howard Shore's soundtrack along with seeing the sweeping cinematography.While it won't bring newcomers to the franchise, ECLIPSE is an improvement over NEW MOON. The romance is less cheesy, the action scenes are a lot bigger, the plot is a lot more interesting, and the film finally has a sense of humor. If you're not a fan of the TWILIGHT saga, you know what to do without me telling you. However, for the fans of the series, you'll be completely satisfied.",7,10,25,30 June 2010
Click," Very Touching
","This film is about a Michael Newman, a father, who works too much and doesn't have too much time on his hands to spend time with his family. He wants his life to be easier so Morty gives him a universal remote that allows Michael to do almost anything with his life. Later though, the remote starts making decisions by itself.This is probably one of the best films of the year and the best Adam Sandler movie ever. It's very funny and has some very sad moments. I think this is the movie that I ever cried so much at. Adam Sandler, Kate Beckinsale, and Christopher Walken give good performances. This isn't your usual Adam Sandler movie. It's fun for the whole family, yes, I said it.The special effects are good and it has some touching moments. The supporting cast role also are funny in this film. This film gives out a really powerful message and everyone should not hear the critics on this. Give it a chance.The best Adam Sandler flick should be watched by everyone. It's both sad and funny. Go see it.",8,2,6,24 November 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Makes Ben Hur look like an Epic
","King Arthur is recruiting his Knights of the Round Table throughout England. After that, they are given a quest by God to find the Holy Grail with a few obstacles along the way.This movie is known by many people as a comedy classic. I was thinking, 'Wow! This must be a hilarious movie!' But was it a hilarious movie? For me, it wasn't. It was by far a decent movie that delivers mostly chuckles.People have different tastes of humor. This movie, I think, is meant to play skit after another skit after another skit, like 'The Ten' or 'The Kentucky Fried Movie'. Well, this was actually my first movie that has skits in it.This movie has a fair share of bad skits and a bit more funny ones which is why I give it a decent rating. There are little parts of the film where it made me laugh out loud. I mostly chuckled throughout or sigh on the bad skits.The cast has a fair share of the humor and they all get along well. Is this movie good? Well, for the most part, yeah. Was the movie hilarious? For the most part, no. I just thought it was a decent comedy but not anything special, though.",7,2,5,25 August 2007
The Cabin in the Woods," You Think You Know the Story...
","No spoilers here, people. I saw CABIN back in March, and, now with some free time, I've decided to write a review for it. To keep this review as spoiler-free as possible, here's the most basic and vague summary I can offer you about the story: A bunch of teens go out to a cabin in the woods and bad stuff happens. Also, you think you know the story, but you really don't, unless you already read the script or have someone spoil it for you, both of which I'd highly advise against. CABIN is one of those films where the less you know about it, the more satisfying the end result is. Trust me when I say to stay away from trailers, reviews, etc. until you have finished seeing the film. However, in this day and age, that's easier said than done, so let me ease your mind when I say that although the trailer does seem to reveal a lot, it's fortunately misleading.A critic who reviewed CABIN discussed it in terms of the three act structure, which I will be doing because it makes it easier to understand without giving much away: In the first act, you'll be thinking, 'I've seen this all before.' As the film progresses to its second act, you'll be thinking, 'Wait. What is going on?' By the third act, you'll think 'What--I can't even...THIS IS CRAZY.' By the time the credits roll, you'll think 'Did I just really see what I thought I saw?!' That was basically my thoughts throughout the film. CABIN is like SCREAM. And again, it isn't. While SCREAM deconstructs the horror genre through the dialogue from its characters, CABIN takes a more subtle approach, as if the filmmakers were winking to the audience. CABIN deconstructs the horror genre and then builds it back up, forming a completely different creature. It assumes the audience is intelligent and has some fun in the process. While SCREAM ridicules the sad state of the horror genre, CABIN celebrates it. It gives reasons why the horror genre exists in the first place and why it should stay. In a way, CABIN even gives reasons why recent horror films are the way they have been for many years.CABIN is both a horror and a comedy, although I would say more comedy than horror. The funny parts are hilarious, and the scary parts are scary. The film effectively mixes the two without feeling awkward, and there's also a great sense of inventiveness going on here. Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon managed to make an ingenious film that is highly entertaining yet intelligent at the same time. However, the film isn't perfect. For one, the group of teens aren't really interesting to care for. They all do their jobs fitting their stereotypical roles and then subverting them, but most are still underdeveloped. However, this issue is minor once the film reveals its more mind-twisting layers. Fran Kranz is the best of the bunch, providing some of the film's biggest laughs. There's also a great pair of veteran actors, Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, who steal every scene they're in. Their chemistry is just undeniable, effectively playing off with each other. Some of the effects work is also rather cheesy. I felt that the film could have used a bigger budget to successfully display the big ideas both Goddard and Whedon had in their crazy heads.Still, the flaws are rather small when compared to the film's monumental successes. CABIN is not only a great film, it is an important one. Regardless if you're a horror fan or not, CABIN reminds us why we go to the movie theaters in the first place. It reminds us why the horror genre is here to stay. Let me end with a quote from critic Emanuel Levy's review of the film: CABIN is 'an important reminder that inventiveness can still go a long way in Hollywood—when it is given a chance to shine.'",8,13,31,8 April 2012
Happy Feet," One of the BEST Films Ever!
","Plot: Every penguin is born to sing to attract a soul mate, except Mumble, due to Memphis, his father, dropping Mumbles when he was still in his egg. Although Mumble can't sing, he can sure tap dance!The animation is BRILLIANT and the plot(s) are great. This film is entertaining with its songs and tap dancing and action sequences. Sure there are some scenes that are inappropriate for children, that's why it's rated PG. This is one of the best animated films of the year!Note that this film isn't cute and cuddly as it shows in commercials and that there are some serious subplots and scary scenes. Still, it's perfectly fine for everyone. This film is also unpredictable because seeing that the movie can end anytime, it makes you wonder. This film is also funny.Elijah Wood and Brittany Murphy are great in the film. I didn't even know Brittany Murphy could even sing that well. Robin Williams, voicing three characters in this film, is very funny. He had great lines.This film isn't filled with a lot of songs and dances and has to do with more of the story. It's great for all ages and it's very entertaining. Go see it!",7,3,8,19 November 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," Is that your final answer?
","There's no need to phone a friend, ask the audience, nor choose a fifty-fifty to determine if you should see this film. The answer is obvious: SEE IT NOW. The film follows the story of the life of an impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik, who becomes a contestant on the Hindi version of 'Who Wants to be A Millionaire?', wins, and is then suspected of cheating.Throughout the film, we learn that Jamal is able to answer the questions in the game show correctly because of key points in his life. Not only is this about a game show, it's about Jamal's life story. The film mixes the flashbacks and present flawlessly. Probably telling a life story of someone is not new. Just last December, there was 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.' However, the fact that the film mixes Jamal's life story with his ability to answer the questions in the game show is quite clever and ingenious. It adds another fresh twist to what might be another story about someone's life.Even too, the game show plays a crucial element to the plot so the whole puzzle fits together perfectly in the end. It's just another thing that makes this movie so great. Now let's talk about the performances. Wow! Weren't they great? Dev Patel gives us a breakthrough performance. Everyone else, although not as memorable as Patel, gave us their all in here too. The soundtrack is also very good. I loved it.So what makes this movie so great? Just watch it. I really can't spoil it. Maybe I can just say it's about fate and destiny but then you might roll your eyes. It's just a captivating film with fantastic performances from unknown actors and in the end, I'll admit it, I really can't find anything to not like about the film. It's what I call a nearly flawless film. Compared to Danny Boyle's previous disappointing film, 'Sunshine,' 'Slumdog Millionaire' is several steps up to the right direction, not to mention one of the best films of this year.",9,2,6,2 January 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," Why Practical Effects Matter
","I won't say anything new about MAD MAX: FURY ROAD that hasn't been said before, so I'll just be preaching to the choir. While Tom Hardy is good and all, it is Charlize Theron's Furiosa that ultimately trumps the titular character in an unexpectedly significant role that is handled with grace and gravitas that one can expect from Theron. The character of Furiosa herself is a revelation, someone you don't normally get to see in a big budget action blockbuster: She is on an equal level playing field as Max, both important, and one helping the other when the situation calls for it. She's also the more interesting character, going through a deeper change and a more emotional journey. It's a good thing, then, that Max is resorted as a background character, which may anger some people, but it works here.On the other hand, the action scenes are something to behold. In a era over-reliant on CGI, director George Miller's throwback to practical effects makes the action scenes come, quite literally, to life. There's a sense of verve, wonder, thrill, and rhythm that you don't usually get from modern action movies, save for Tarantino's DEATH PROOF and the FAST AND FURIOUS movies. Even then, those films look insignificant in comparison. Maybe FURY ROAD is Miller's way of reminding us what we've been missing out on for the past several years. Maybe it's his plea to get action movies back to their roots. Or maybe Miller just wanted to show the world the visionary he really is. After all, THE ROAD WARRIOR had inspired many action films since its release, and one can expect FURY ROAD to do the same...again.",9,2,6,19 May 2015
Donnie Darko," This is the Director's Cut Review
","Troubled adolescent, Donnie Darko, receives a disturbing vision that the world will end in 28 days. With the help of various characters, including a 6 foot rabbit called Frank, he slowly discovers the mysterious physical and metaphysical laws that govern his life and that will lead up to the destruction of the universe.I have just finished watching the director's cut of this film, never have seen the original (finally!). I have to say this movie makes you think a lot, like Mulholland Drive. It turns out something more than you expect the plot to be, which is why I liked the movie.This film is also confusing and needed some help for some explaining that I didn't get in the film. Now I finally get this whole movie and thought it was clever but not as much as you follow on with the movie, which is why I'm not giving this a perfect rating.This film is dark, disturbing, and sometimes shocking like Mulholland Drive and The Butterfly Effect, a similar movie to Donnie Darko. The acting by Jake Gyllenhaal is really good with this weird role.There might be a time where you watch the movie, think about it, and you've thought of a plot hole. There could be a plot hole in the movie but some people may think it isn't. If you like movies that make you think, turns out to be really clever, watch Donnie Darko.",9,2,6,28 April 2007
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Transformers 3 with the Extra 'D'!
","To explain the plot of TF3 is like trying to explain rocket science to a child. You just can't. It has something to do with some Spock-voiced robot crash landing on the moon in the 60s and some teleportation pillars having to do with the end of the world or something, but I digress. It's already giving me a headache. TF3 can be basically seen as an apology from Michael Bay after making the hated TF2. He said it would be 100% better. He lied. Sure, TF3 has a hint of a story this time around, and the film tries really hard to show us this, but it fails miserably. At least TF2 didn't try to have a plot (which is probably due to the fact that the script wasn't even finished when they began shooting the film), and at least it was entertaining.Even removing the two annoying racist twin robots from TF2, TF3 is still worse. Why? Because it's a dull film. It turns out that watching the same thing thrice isn't as interesting as watching it the first two times. It tries to be different, but when you get down to it, it's more of the same, but with one huge difference: Bay decides to save all the action in the last 45 minutes of the film. And seeing how people watch these films for the action, we have to wait about 100 whole minutes to see it. Now this shouldn't be a problem had the film had an interesting story and characters to invest in. Well, it didn't. It's a LOOOONG 100 minutes of unfunny jokes and non-existent, incoherent storytelling. Seriously, Bay could have easily cut 30 minutes off the film, but you know how he is. His films just have to be over two hours, don't they?But anyway, once we finally get to see the action, it's actually quite impressive. With the addition of 3D, it's pretty damn amazing. And because of the Chicago sequence alone, TF3 isn't a total lost cause. We eventually do get what we came for. As for the 3D, I liked the use of it. It was shot in 3D instead of converted into 3D during postproduction, so you really get to see the depth and stuff popping out during the entire film, especially during the Chicago sequence where you see the depth of the city and people flying around (among many other things).The actors in here are efficient. It's not like they actually have to act. They just run and yell. Newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Megan Fox's replacement, is pretty decent too, although it's easy to imagine that Fox could have done the same. Veteran actors John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, and Leonard Nimoy give a response of pity rather than a warm welcome as we much prefer them not have their resumes tainted by this film. But anyway, they are in the film for good, and there's not much we can do about it. Ken Jeong is pretty annoying but (thankfully) does not appear in the film any more than 5 minutes. Alan Tudyk--why? Why are you in this? You're better than this!Anyway, I'll get off my soap box now. Of the 157 minutes(!!) TF3 has, about 45 minutes are actually fun to watch. The other minutes....aren't. I mean, it's a Transformers movie. It's the third one in the series. You know what to expect. By this time, you already know if this is for you or not. If it is, watch it in 3D. Or maybe don't, just so they don't make a fourth film. I'd imagine people will get tired of Transformers soon enough (like me) as the case of sequelitis becomes increasingly apparent.",3,9,20,2 July 2011
The Social Network," You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies.
","On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history...but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications. (Sony Pictures)THE SOCIAL NETWORK is not about Facebook. It's about Mark Zuckerberg and the people associated with him and the consequences that arise with the evolution of Facebook. In an even broader sense, it's about friends being driven apart due to money and betrayal. Because of this, it's no surprise that many have already compared this to CITIZEN KANE. And it's not just the similarities in themes that are astounding, it's the quality as well.What makes THE SOCIAL NETWORK so good is the masterfully written script by Aaron Sorkin. The film is filled with impeccable dialog that just sucks you in. It would be no surprise if the film won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. Director David Fincher also does a great job keeping the audience captivated through and through with a consistently fast pace. Really, you'll probably be drawn to the film's opening argument between two characters than any other scene this year. All right, I'm exaggerating, but you get the point. It's not Fincher's best work, but it's in the top 3.Jesse Eisenberg and co-star Andrew Garfield are the driving force behind this film. Eisenberg does a terrific job delivering the lines as he did while Garfield brings in an emotional aspect to the film. Although both are quite excellent, Garfield's performance is Oscar worthy. Rooney Mara is quickly getting up the ladder after having last seen her in the remake of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET in the beginning of the year. She's just in a few scenes, but she's great in them. I would have like to see her more in the film, though. Apparently, Armie Hammer played two characters as twins in the film, which really blew me away when I found out because I thought they were two different actors. He really distinguished the characters really well. Oh, and if you're worried about Justin Timberlake, don't be. He's really good in here. I also loved Rashida Jones in the few scenes she was in.With terrific performances from the cast all around, a brilliant script, some fine directing by Fincher, and an engaging score by Trent Reznor, it should be no surprise that THE SOCIAL NETWORK succeeded the way it did. Although it's a 2-hour dialog driven film, it absolutely engrossing to watch. If anything, this is probably the closest modern version of CITIZEN KANE that we will ever get in a long time. THE SOCIAL NETWORK is easily one of the best films of the year.",10,88,172,2 October 2010

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The Least Entertaining in the Trilogy
","Indiana Jones acquires a diary that holds clues and a map with no names to find the mysterious Holy Grail, which was sent from his father, Dr. Henry Jones, in Italy. Upon hearing from a private collector, Walter Donavan, that the mission for the Holy Grail went astray with the disappearance of his father, Indiana Jones and museum curator, Marcus Brody, venture to Italy in search of Indy's father.However, upon retrieving Dr. Henry Jones in Nazi territory, the rescue mission turns into a race to find the Holy Grail before the Nazis do, who plan to use it for complete world domination for their super-race. With the diary as a vital key and the map with no names as a guide, Indiana Jones once again finds himself in another death defying adventure of pure excitement.Well, I was surly disappointed in this film. It's still a good film, but not as entertaining nor fun as the previous two. What I missed in this movie was the whole archaeological sense, booby traps, and technical aspect from the last two. In here, it felt like watching 'National Treasure' and 'The Da Vinci Code' all over again, but in a less entertaining way.I might be bashed by saying that but I really expected more than just another 'look for treasure' type of movie that doesn't do it as entertaining as the previous two mentioned film. However, there are some pretty funny and entertaining scenes provided mostly by Harrison Ford and newcomer Sean Connery. As for everything else, it's pretty much the same. So if you've been enjoying these films, you'll enjoy this. If not, then well, stop here.",6,1,4,11 June 2008

Now, he must find the Doc and convince him that he is from the future, in order for the Doc to send him back to the future, but this is the least of Marty's problem. After accidentally getting in the way of the important meeting between his future mother and father, Marty must get them back together before he changes time forever, and destroys his own existence.This may not be one of the most complex time travel movie, but it is sure a lot of fun! I love time travel movies. Everything you've seen from an average time travel movie is seen here: Person goes to the past and if he changes anything, the future will change; but only this time, there are some problems with having a mother loving her son (actually falling in love with each other).Now this is one weird and wacky time travel movie. There are things that have been done in other time travel movies before (even theories made up by one of the characters) but there are also new and maybe not as original (as I hoped) things in here to enjoy and mess your mind around. But the main thing is try to not over complicate what is going on. Just have fun.",8,1,1,27 December 2007

Bourne, who promised retaliation should anyone from his former life attempt contact, is forced to once again take up his life as a trained assassin to survive.Was this movie confusing? Yes, well, not until I stopped the movie, read the info. I didn't get on the computer and went back on watching it. I think I should do that with confusing movies instead getting confused throughout the movie. So I had less trouble with this film.I liked this film better than the first. The plot gets more interesting, there are more suspenseful scenes, and better action, including a prolonged car chase sequence and one sweet, quiet moment in the film.Although I don't know how the character acts in the book, Matt Damon's acting was really well in this film, along with Joan Allen and Brian Cox. I also liked the hand held camera throughout the movie, giving it a suspenseful feel.Still, although not better than Casino Royale or any Mission Impossible film (well, maybe better than the first), this film is better than the first. It gives you a sense of suspense and emotion.",8,3,4,29 May 2007
The Proposal," Here comes the bribe...
","Publishing powerhouse Margaret Tate is used to getting her way. She bullies her ambitious assistant, Andrew Paxton. But Margaret, a native Canadian, finds her career in jeopardy when she is denied a visa and learns she will be sent northward. She forces Andrew to become her fiancé, but she'll have to take a trip home to Alaska with him to prove to U.S. Immigration that their impending union is genuine.Every once in awhile, you must be willing to forgive a romantic comedy of its clichéd-filled plot because it's executed so well. THE PROPOSAL is one of those movies. Yes, mostly everything is done strictly by the numbers and yes, we can see the ending coming even before the movie begins but you feel so happy and warm and fuzzy inside that you want the conventional to happen.Most of this is because of the two leads: Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Both have such a great chemistry together and their scenes filled with head-on sarcasm hit the right funny spots! They elevate the movie to a higher level. Other supporting cast members include Betty White, Craig T. Nelson, and Mary Steenburgen, who all have their moments in the film.However, with all this delightful things going on, there were some problems in the film. One main one is that it has some kind of bipolar disorder. For example, one scene starts off sad and tragic and one second later, it's a sitcom. It's like the movie didn't know which route to go to. This happens frequently especially in the last half hour of the film.But other than that, the film is light and fluffy. It plays it safe and sticks to the conventions but you wouldn't mind because of the two terrific leads, whom make it better than most romantic comedies. There are also some standout scenes including one where both Bullock and Reynolds talk about themselves in a bedroom at night, which is truly heartfelt. Hey, I guess I'm sentimental, but you know what? I enjoyed the movie.",6,0,1,18 October 2009
Warm Bodies," Cold body. Warm heart.
","Before the trailer was released, everyone thought 'Warm Bodies' was going to be 'Twilight with zombies,' although some would argue that 'Twilight' was already filled with zombies. However, I'm happy to put this issue to rest: 'Warm Bodies' is nothing like 'Twilight.' They're not even in the same family tree. In fact, 'Warm Bodies' is a clever take on the Romeo and Juliet story, spinning the zombie genre on its head. The way the film subverts and even breaks the rules of your typical zombie movie gave the film some freedom to play with the material that no other zombie movies have done before.Now this may anger die-hard zombie fans, like how 'Twilight' angered vampire fans. After all, zombies can't talk. That's just pure blasphemy! In this world, they do. Pure and simple. If it takes a film to break the rules in order to breathe in new life to a certain genre (i.e. 'The Cabin in the Woods,' 'Scream') and to tell more refreshing stories, I want more filmmakers to start breaking the rules. 'Warm Bodies' is unlike any zombie flick OR romantic-comedy you've ever seen before. It's original. It's unique. It's invigorating. It's just plain exciting to watch unfold on screen.The film has its funny moments and its horror moments, but what really sells the film is its genuine heart. Its plea for hope, compassion, and empathy is something rarely seen in films, and it works without feeling like it's hitting us over in the head with it. There are moments where you get to know the characters - and I mean really get to know them - that are so poignant and unexpected that it hits you right in the heart. And I cried. Oh, yes, I did. Several times, in fact. It also helps that the film's leads, Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer, are terrific and have great chemistry as well. Rob Corddry is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, and he has some great moments in the film. Additionally, Dave Franco is pretty damn good, especially if you consider the unconventional way the filmmakers develop his character.To say the least, 'Warm Bodies' blew me away. It's an extremely well made film with an even greater story to support it. However, coming from '50/50' director Jonathan Levine, it also shouldn't be that surprising. 'Warm Bodies' is already a contender to be one of the best films of 2013.",7,7,14,6 February 2013
Valkyrie," Many saw evil. They dared to stop it.
","At the height of WW2, a group of high-ranking German officers hatched a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, and seize power of the military command in order to end the war. The operation was codenamed 'Valkyrie', for the emergency plan that was meant to be used in case of a revolt against the Nazi government.Let me get to the point: Don't let the trailer for the film fool you. Don't let the director fool you. Don't even let Tom Cruise fool you. What's being advertised as a nail-biting, suspenseful film, many people will be disappointed that 'Valkyrie' is more like the opposite. It's not a bad film, honestly. I enjoyed it but when watching the film, get ready to hear a lot of coughing in the audience to break the silence throughout the film.The movie is actually two separate films: The first half is actually the planning of Hitler's assassination. Due to the film being built upon this secret plan, none of the 'action' really starts until the second half. That's where the problem lies. The first film is pretty...uneventful. The second half, although much more exciting and more things happening, is still not as 'action packed' as you hope it to be.I guess if you're a person who likes dialog to fill the screen for the first half and some action the second, you'll enjoy it. It's great, actually, because the film doesn't need mindless action to fill up the running time, which is partly the reason why I liked the film. However, if you want it like Bryan Singer's previous efforts, you'll be disappointed.I won't be surprised if the majority of the people find this film boring and too talky. I won't blame them for expecting something much more like shown in the trailer. However, it's based on a true story so you know the filmmakers were trying to keep it true, although maybe changing a few things for the silver screen. Tom Cruise does a decent job as Stauffenberg, the mastermind behind the plan, although not an Oscar worthy performance (that would go to his performance in 'Tropic Thunder,' of course). Everyone else also do a decent job for what they have.In the end, although not as big as the advertising make it out to be, along with the names on the movie, the film is, in my opinion, what I call, passable entertainment and important history for people to learn, if they hadn't known already. The film is more a psychological film than an action blockbuster starring Tom Cruise. Yes, I'll admit, it's Cruise and Singer's weaker efforts but you can't deny them for trying their best for what they have.",6,9,19,26 December 2008
The Simpsons Movie," It's Big! It's Funny! It's The Simpsons Movie!
","When Homer mistakenly pollutes the river with toxic waste from his 'Pig Crap' silo, he causes the EPA to encase Springfield in a glass dome, and must save them before President Schwarzenegger gives the order for the town to be destroyed.Although I'm not a huge fan of the television show, I'm a fan. 'The Simpsons' is arguably one of the best television shows ever created. Even the new seasons can bring some chuckles. Now I must say, if you don't know anything about The Simpsons, then the movie won't be as effective if you were a fan. I can say that fans will be really pleased and satisfied.This movie will make you laugh-out-loud and chuckle. Sure, this movie isn't going to win any Oscars but the film is really entertaining and that's the only thing that matters. The plot isn't that great but who cares? It's about the jokes in here. We don't care about the plot. Even Bart shows some nudity and some other jokes in the film are surprisingly vulgar, which makes me say that it's not always kid-friendly.Every character has a moment to shine. How could they fit every character (or most character) in the mere 80 minutes? I don't know but they did it. I also liked the cameos and spoofs in the film. Although there are many jokes in the film, there are some quiet and sad scenes, which, surprisingly, are really lovely.If you want an entertaining film, here you go. If you want a film with a great story and has this moral in the end, stay away. It's not trying to be cutesy and just for the kids to enjoy. There is some adult humor and everyone will laugh and have the time of their lives. It's worth your money. Trust me.",7,1,4,28 July 2007
Dodgeball," If You Can Dodge a Wrench, You Can Dodge a Ball
","This film is about a man, Peter La Fleur, who needs to pay his debts or else his gym will be bought by a corporate health fitness chain. So, he and some of his friends decides to sign up for a dodgeball tournament in which they need to win $50,000.This is a very funny movie. It has witty dialog and probably some very crude jokes that I found gross. Most jokes are funny and clever that would entertain you or gross you out.The acting by Vince Vaughn and Christine Taylor are good while Ben Stiller and Justin Long are very funny. Ben Stiller is very different in the movie.This film is short and funny, if you want to get some time off and has great jokes. This is a very entertaining film and you should see it!",7,1,2,17 February 2007
Up in the Air," The story of a man ready to make a connection.
","Ryan Bingham's job is to fire people from theirs. The anguish, hostility, and despair of his 'clients' has left him falsely compassionate, living out of a suitcase, and loving every second of it. When his boss hires arrogant young Natalie, she develops a method of video conferencing that will allow termination without ever leaving the office - essentially threatening the existence Ryan so cherishes. Determined to show the naive girl the error of her logic, Ryan takes her on one of his cross country firing expeditions, but as she starts to realize the disheartening realities of her profession, he begins to see the downfalls to his way of life.UP IN THE AIR is a realistic outlook on life, something we don't see in films very often, and I'm not saying this because the film is about the firing of workers due to the downturn of the economy. However, that certain aspect does make the film very relevant to these days than if the film were to be released a few years prior. And ultimately, this realism that runs throughout the film is what makes it so good.I would only assume the film will get nominated for however many Oscars because it deserves so many but one I'm certain it'll get nominated for is the Best Adapted Screenplay category. I usually never talk about screenplays in my reviews much because films I watch usually have a sufficient screenplay, which is nothing to scream about. However, UP IN THE AIR is a well written screenplay, filled with some great dialogue and not the ones you've heard from JUNO. This is what I call a good screenplay.And there is nobody better than to say those lines from the screenplay other than George Clooney himself, who is slowly growing to be one of the more well respected actors out there because of the certain great films he chooses to star in. Clooney is very good in this film and I stress the words 'very' and 'good.' Not only is he charismatic and funny like we usually see him in many of his films, but he branches out his performance in scenes with isolation and sadness. Here, Vera Farmiga plays an entirely different character than she did with her role in another film that was released in the same year, ORPHAN, but she is just as good or even better maybe getting her nominated for an Oscar in the Best Supporting Actress category.Anna Kendrick starred in last year's highly successful NEW MOON but it's apparent that she'll most likely be remembered for her role in this film. Here, she plays the naive but successful young graduate but plays it off really well that makes one think, 'Why is she even spending her time in the Twilight movies?' Even other actors who spend probably one or two scenes in the entire film altogether, including Jason Bateman, J.K. Simmons, Danny McBride, and Zach Galifianakis, pull off some very good performances.UP IN THE AIR is not a comedy. It is, at times, dark, although there are many scenes of great humor that balances the film quite nicely. But overall, it's authentic in the way the film observes a man's lonely and isolated life who fires people for a living. I must give credit to director Jason Reitman because he is still strong after three films. Who knows what he'll do next. Funny, dark, witty, and poignant, UP IN THE AIR is one of the best films of 2009.",10,0,4,2 January 2010
V for Vendetta," Remember, Remember the 5th of November
","A shadowy freedom fighter known only as 'V' uses terrorist tactics to fight against his totalitarian society. Upon rescuing a girl from the secret police, he also finds his best chance at having an ally.This film, itself, is visually stunning with a thought-provoking story that is a solid piece of entertainment. Its production design are amazing and the overall look of the film is fantastic. This is one of the best films of 2006.I have to watch this film a second time because it was very confusing the first. I didn't understand the long words and new characters appear in other scenes that are important to the plot. Now that I have read someone's summary and have seen it a second time, I understand the film and it's very good.The acting by Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are great. There are some great visualized scenes with some great action scenes but it's more in the vein on Batman Begins, which is a good thing. There aren't really many action scenes but I wasn't disappointed because this movie keeps your attention.If you want an intriguing story more than a bombastic action thriller, this is a fantastic film. It will keep your attention for the visualized scenes and great story.",10,1,4,13 March 2007
The Island," Great Popcorn Film!
","This film is about Lincoln Six-Echo (McGregor) who is in a Utopian world, which is said to be a place where people find them after a contamination occurred. His friend is Jordan Two-Delta (Johansson). There is a lottery drawing each week to get one lucky person to go to 'The Island' which reportedly is the last uncontaminated spot on the planet. Later, Lincoln discovers that there is no island and that he and the others are clones. Licoln and Jordan make an escape which leads them to the real futuristic world where they must avoid being captured from the makers of the clones by escaping close calls.This is a fun action thrill ride! The special effects are great! This is a great summer blockbuster hit. The beginning starts off slow but picks up later on. The screen couple, McGregor and Johansson, goes together great. You don't need your brain for this movie. It's just mindless action. It's a chase thriller. They run here and there. There is some weak dialog but we don't care. It's better to see action scenes than to actually care about the plot.The way Michael Bay reveals that the community is fake is interesting. We see one question being answered after another until we reach the big finale. The ending is satisfying but it's not great. This is a long movie but you won't care because this is such a good movie, you won't even care about the plot holes in this movie. I don't care about anything but just wanting the characters to reach their main goal. This is another great McGregor film, including his Star War films.Just watch this film if you want to see a mindless action film and you'll be fine. Come to this movie with a brain and you won't like it as much. Get ready for a full throttle thriller!",6,0,0,18 March 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Anchorman is Funnier, This One Has a Better Plot
","NASCAR stock car racing sensation Ricky Bobby is a national hero because of his 'win at all costs' approach. He and his loyal racing partner, childhood friend Cal Naughton Jr., are a fearless for their ability to finish so many races in the #1 and #2 positions, with Cal always in second place. When flamboyant French Formula One driver Jean Girard challenges them for the supremacy of NASCAR, Ricky Bobby must face his own demons and fight Girard for the right to be known as racing's top driver.Okay, I'm kind of disappointed in this film for not being funnier than Anchorman, another film made by these people of Talladega Nights. I've only laughed out loud in some scenes but really chuckled throughout the whole movie.Though that was a weakness, this film actually has a better story than Anchorman! I don't even know if this film tries to be a dramedy or if it is a dramedy because the middle of the movie tries to be a drama but it really don't give you the jokes so I would expect it's a dramedy. I must be crazy. Maybe I'm getting the wrong idea here.Still, I have to say Will Ferrell's performance is funny in the film. I was partcially disappointed that John C. Reilly and Sacha Baron Cohen weren't in the movie that long than I would expect.Although not as funny as Anchorman, this was a good comedy, having a good storyline, and some funny performances. If you like Will Ferrel with all his funny roles, you'll like this.",6,1,2,23 April 2007
