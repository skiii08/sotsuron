Miracle," The greatest hockey movie and greatest Disney movie ever made
","The movie I thought was an excellent movie. From the action to the fashion, every thing was nailed on the head. Being from a suburb of Minneapolis/ St. Paul and this movie being released on the weekend of the all-star game in St. Paul, it was perfect timing the story of a Minnesota legend and the first all-star game in Minnesota. I was moved by this movie and had a hidden message to it. The message was no matter how tough your opponents are, you can be tougher and beat them. When Kurt Russell made that tribute to Herb before the all-star game, it was also great. Bravo Disney:) Here's to following your dreams Matthew Chesterton Big Lake, MN",10,1,1,17 May 2005
