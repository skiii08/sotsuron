Angels & Demons," Angels and Demo......... Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
","In a nut shell, this is just like the first one but totally see through with nowhere near as much tension or story line. If you fail to see the twist coming at the end of this movie you'll probably enjoy it 1% more than I did.If only the puzzles got the audience thinking it would have grabbed my attention at least, but when it's just 'find sculpture... it's pointing west, let's go' it uses very little of the old gray matter, and the brain juices fail to activate.It was well directed and the acting was excellent, but fails on all other levels. Totally forgettable.",Null,0,2,15 September 2009
