Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The best Comic Movie
","As far as what Marvel did in the first 10 years.... this for me was the best film. It was the most down to earth (comic wise) and relatable film of all. Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE marvel fan and general have rated their movies high, (with the obvious exception of Captain Marvel) I liked this the best.",10,2,14,27 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," These movies do not count towards the legacy
","1) None of these last 3 films progressed or concluded the sky walker storyline. AT ALL.
2) They used cheesy gimmicks to bring back nostalgia instead of thinking - what storyline actually progresses the sky walker legacy.
3) After they could not create a proper villain they decided to do what they did?!! (No spoiler inserted) ARE YOU KIDDING ME?I can literally bring up over 50 cheesy items about these last 3 films but I am TOO LAZY to continue.JJ Abrams PLEASE leave Star Wars alone and go back to do a Lost sequel. Except this time maybe you could bring us a real ending.These movies where complete trash.",1,26,61,21 December 2019

",Did not expect this movie to be soooo funny and entertaining. One of my favorites.,9,1,11,27 October 2019
Midsommar," Real review - complete trash
","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is absolutely unwatchable.Firstly the acting is horrific. It feels like I am back in acting class watching first year actors try their 'scenes'. How this film even got funding is beyond me. It was so bad that I had to fast forward through some scenes not to fall asleep.Secondly direction and script are tacky, weak, pointless and highly uninspired. Again pure amateur work .If you do not believe me feel free to watch it for yourself and compare it to quality independent movies that have come out in the past.I rarely say this but what a waste of time!",1,3,13,7 March 2020
