Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not for the politically correct
","This movie was HILARIOUS!!!! It's definitely not a movie for the politically correct or easily offended. There is one scene that I believe was unnecessarily drawn out and somewhat repulsive, the wrestling scene, but either than that, the rest of the movie was GREAT and makes that one scene forgivable (sp?? oh well) Anyhow, the entire audience were laughing hysterically and the last time I remember laughing as much and as hard was when I saw 'Team America.' A lot of the humor is also spoken and not just visual, so PAY ATTENTION!! This is not exactly the 'family movie' of the year, but definitely a good one for 'comedy movie' of the year!",10,3,15,4 November 2006
