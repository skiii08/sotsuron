Requiem for a Dream," Wow
","All I will say is that for those of you who didn't like this film, that is the desired effect.  How many movies have you seen that make you cringe and want to kill yourself?  This did what every movie wishes to do: Take you to another place where you experience emotions that you probably never would have had you not watched this film. 9/10",9,0,0,2 July 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," I feel sorry for you....
","I feel sorry for you who cannot enjoy an amazing motion picture like this. People complain about the dialogue: what were you expecting?  Empire Strikes Back has such lines as 'You no good, half-witted, scruffy lookin' nerf herder!' and we don't hear complaints.  If you are going to critique Clones for such nonsense like cliches and dialogue then you must do the same for Lord of the Rings.  These films are not Tarantino films, don't go in expecting them to be.  And the love story is not shakespeare.  These are unexperienced lovers who have never had the opportunities to express themselves, and hence they come off as childish --> completely accurate! For those of of you who take yourself to seriously and can't enjoy such an amazing film, well, it sucks to be you.10/10",5,1,2,18 May 2002
The Village," Requires an intelligent audience
","This movie is plain brilliant. Period. The majority of people will not like it, however, because the majority of people do not have the I.Q. to understand it. If you like at most of the reviews here, they are riddled with a lot of 'How come's' and 'Why don't they just's.' All of these are easily refutable. For example:HUGE SPOILER WARNING!!!I've heard many morons say 'Of all the people they could send, why would they send the blind girl?' They absolutely must send the blind girl because she cannot see! What would happen if she saw a car? She would freak out, and the secrecy of their village would be ruined. That's why the escorts had to stop at the trail.'Why don't they just go out and find another place to live?'Because William Hurt's character, the son of a billionaire, was exposed to an enormous amount of greed, backstabbing, murder, and distrust that billionaires have to deal with. The Village is something he has funded to keep his people safe from this corruption. The 'People of whom we don't speak' are just an insurance policy to keep them out of the forest and away from the borders.This movie is incredible.",9,0,0,31 July 2004
The Transporter," I'm sick of Hollywood yanking us around
","I could make this an elaborate review, but I'll keep it short and simple:Someone shoots a rocket launcher at a man at nearly point blank range. The man picks up a trash can lid, A TRASH CAN LID, and deflects the missile.I'm really sick of this kind of crap.",Null,0,0,13 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A new level of Cinema
","This is the only film I've ever seen that embodied EVERY positive aspect of cinema.  Effects, drama, humor, action, suspense, emotional, breathtakling, etc.  If this film does not win best picture, it will exceed the injustice that occurred in 1998 when SHakespeare in Love beat out Saving Private Ryan.10, inarguably.",10,0,0,18 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Greatest Film Of All Time
","This takes the cake.  It runs away where it's prequel stopped.  We find out who everyone is, we see the dark side a lot more, and of course Yoda, Boba Fett, and the greatest uses of color ever in a film.  Amazing ending. Never ending entertainment, and most of all, a dark ending that leaves you begging for more.  The greatest.",10,0,0,3 July 2001
