Black Swan," Cinematic Masterpiece
","Black Swan is simply brilliant.In spite of my own deep appreciation of the screenplay, directing and superb acting, I did not get the full impact of the real underlying issue until I watched Stefan Molyneux's video (http://blip.tv/file/4616227) and the text of that video(http://freedomainradio.com/BOARD/forums/t/28984.aspx).The performances are all superb, but Natalie Portman is at her all time best. Darren Aronofsky's direction is stunning. Do not miss this film!Black Swan is my unquestionable favorite film of 2010. See it! Please do not visit the aforementioned web-sites until you have seen the film. They will spoil your full appreciation of Black Swan.",10,1,3,11 February 2011
Unbreakable," Disappointing
","Like so many others, I just loved The Sixth Sense. I saw it shortly after it opened in theatres, and enthusiastically waited for the DVD to be released. Watching The Sixth Sense the second time around was just as rewarding a cinema experience as the first. Perhaps even more so. Subsequent viewings have given me even more insight into this marvelous film.So when I learned that M. Night Shyamalan was going to write and direct a new movie with Bruce Willis, I anxiously anticipated its release. I couldn't wait to see Unbreakable.I was very careful to avoid the natural desire to compare Unbreakable with The Sixth Sense. I went out of my way to try to enjoy and evaluate it on its own merits. Furthermore, I admire M. Night Shyamalan and wanted Unbreakable to be a good movie. Alas, it just didn't happen.Despite my enthusiasm, at one point I found myself nodding off. M. Night Shyamalan is a fine screen writer and director, but Unbreakable simply misses the mark. While Unbreakable is not a terrible film it is terribly disappointing. It simply lacks the depth and sophistication of Shyamalan's earlier effort. When it was all over I said to myself, 'So what!'I rate it 7/10",7,0,0,22 December 2000
Fight Club," A waste of time
","This heavily hyped film is first rate trash. I'm surprised I had the patience to watch it for an hour.I cannot recall another film quite this boring. However, if you think you can derive pleasure from watching young men beat one another up for no other reason than they like to beat one another up, this film is for you.For me, it was a waste of time!",3,3,7,10 November 2000
Insomnia," Pacino makes it work!
","Insomnia is a tough film to comment on. The story and screenplay are OK. Christopher Nolan's direction is excellent and Pacino's performance is dynamite; however, the sum total is still not enough to make this film first-rate.I saw Insomnia at a matinee and watched Pacino having great difficulty getting some sorely needed sleep. On the other hand I found myself nodding off. Something was missing. I give Insomnia 7/10.",7,0,0,26 May 2002
Cloverfield," Absolutely worst film of all time . . .
","I've seen a multitude of films in my 68 years. Cloverfield stands out as the worst film I have every seen - an all time low in movie-making! Be warned. Every moment of this film is boring and pointless. There is no beginning - there is no middle or ending. There is simply no story! It is little more than a hodgepodge of senseless images and meaningless chatter. Cloverfield is a film devoid of any value. It is quite simply a pointless piece of trash and a waste of anyone's time. I find it incomprehensible that $25,000,000 was spent creating this travesty of cinema. I also find it remarkable that as of this writing 25% of voters rated this film with a 10. It is most likely that this group was either suffering from severe mental retardation or under the influence of powerful psychotropic drugs. Do not waste your time on Cloverfield - I regret the $1 I spend renting the DVD.",1,1,3,25 May 2008
Split," Beyond bad .
",Probably the worst firm I've seen in years.Stupid story; ridiculous characters and a complete waste of two hours.Better to watch 'Sixth Sense' again. I'm at a complete loss for words to describe just how bad this film is. I wish there were negative votes allowed.,1,11,30,17 May 2017
Taken," First-class Action with lots of heart!
","A previous comment was titled 'Neeson is the vodka of James Bond's martini.' Truer words could not be spoken. I can't think of any Bond film that was more satisfying, and I love Bond (the Connery originals).Taken is a superb action film with substance. Every scene will keep you riveted to your seat. Some of the scenes are literally breathtaking. The screenplay was expertly written, beautifully filmed and superbly edited.Lian Neeson is in usual top form and was a perfect choice. This is the same actor who gave us Schindler and Ethan Frome. I won't waste words on plot -- other comments have already made that clear.The high votes for this very satisfying film are more than well-deserved. One of the best I've seen in a while. Not to be missed.",10,3,6,1 March 2009
Vanilla Sky," About as bad as it gets!!
","While Vanilla Sky clearly sports some very talented actors, this film is total nonsense.I find it amazing that money can be raised, actors and crew can be assembled to make a film of such incredibly small worth. It's not entertaining; it's not educational; it's little more than cinematic trash.So same your time and save your money.",1,0,3,7 July 2002
300," This film could not have been worse!!
","This film is a puzzlement! It's too violent for children and no mature adult would wish to view it. So, it is actually a film for no one! Folks, this is not cinema -- it is a comic book on film with cardboard characters drenched in blood. And boring as well.I find it remarkable that so many voters have given this film such high marks. Perhaps this type of trash is what moviegoers are looking for these days and reflects on their desire to view gratuitous violence and bloodshed.300 is simply a cinematic failure. There are thousands of great films to watch. We really don't need this one so look elsewhere for quality entertainment.",1,4,10,25 January 2008
