Blade Runner 2049," Very Slow and Boring Movie
","I give this movie 2 and the rating of 2 is that the movie did a great job with product placement. The movie excelled in getting their sponsors more advertising bang for their dollars.Then its really chuck in a few big stars like Gosling, Ford who go through a storyline thats already been told.The movie goes for like 2 hours and a half, you probably can have more fun watching the grass grow. I was checking the cinema and most people were playing with their phones. Quite a few people left early.The storyline is boring and its more of a 'lets tick of all the boxes' to appease to all demographics. I'd like to go into this more and explain why its so bad, but I don't want to spoil it for the rest who are going to waste their $.For me this movie was a waste of $15 and $8.50 for popcorn. You'd be better off waiting a few months and get it for free.",2,7,14,14 October 2017
The Hunger Games," Battle Royale Clone
","The first one is really copying Battle Royale, has hardly any original ideas.For instance - Set on a small deserted island - The government chooses a bunch of kids that will kill each other - The winners are the two lovers, who fight against everyone else - There are explosions and disasters that put everyone into the same area - The winner is the last one standing and gets to go free - The deaths are announced to all the competitors - Characters that love killing that are volunteersThe part of Battle Royale where they televise the deaths, this was taken from 'The Condemned' low budge film that no one probably watched. Which also pits a number of adults and taps into the concept of televising contestants against each other.Do we remember, Running Man.",Null,20,26,26 November 2014
