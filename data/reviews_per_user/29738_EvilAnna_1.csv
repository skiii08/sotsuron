The Sound of Music," Great, Classic Movie
","I have to say, I just love this movie and I enjoy discussing it with others that also like it! My favourite scene in it is definitely the Do Re Mi scene. This will always be a great movie and I think it's brilliant that it is still watched everywhere.",10,3,10,17 June 2001
