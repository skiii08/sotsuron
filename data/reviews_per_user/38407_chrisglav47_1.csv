United 93," You have to see this film
","I was totally prepared not to see this movie. As painful it is to remember September 11th, I had to go see United 93 out of respect.Reading newspaper articles, I had heard that a movie regarding United flight 93 was coming out and my thoughts were great!!-Here comes some gold-digger wanting to make a movie about perhaps the biggest tragedy our nation has ever seen. (I say perhaps because everyone has an opinion and might rank Pearl Harbor, JFK or The Challenger up there as well).I am so happy that my preconceived notions were completely wrong. The movie did what I needed it to accomplish. The film showed tremendous respect and honors the passengers and crew of United 93, as well those who were in the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. United 93 also showed the horror of those who had to watch and stand by helpless as the day's events unfolded.United 93 wasn't glamorous nor did it pull any punches. It was an emotionally hard film to watch but something we need to see. Myself I did something I have never done before in a theater; I yelled at the screen... I haven't had a movie ever hit me with such emotion and force. United 93 is a wake up call that our war against terrorism is not over and a film that was necessary to make. Thank you for reading this and God Bless Chris",10,6,15,30 April 2006
