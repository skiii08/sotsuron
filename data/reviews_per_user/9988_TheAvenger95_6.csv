The Avengers," Superhero movie gold... it doesn't get any better than this.
","The plot was great. It's simple enough for normal movie goers to follow, yet complex enough for the fans who've been following the continuity to go 'oh yeah! This ties-in with this, and this relates to that!'. Whedon really pulled it off well, considering this could have gone a 100 ways wrong. The pacing was also exceptional (something the other 5 movies never really mastered) Very few questions are left unanswered by the end. It really is a good, well rounded story from start to finish. Don't expect too many easter eggs or cameos, because to be honest, there were almost none. As a fan-boy, I'm a little disappointed, but at the same time, I fully understand that they didn't want another IM2.The characters all shine. There is no 'star of the movie' (and if I absolutely HAD to pick.. I'd have to go with Banner/Hulk). Every single character gets his/her moment(s). I do have a lot more to say about each individual actor/actress and their respective character, but I wouldn't want to spoil any of the amazing and surprising character moments. I will say this though: the acting from some of the guys/gals were FAR better than I could ever have imagined, and the actors of whom I was expecting great things, weren't as good as I thought they'd be (I did have unfairly high expectations for them though)The action: every fight sequence is straight out of a comic book. You'll see scenes that will immediately make you realize: the guy who made this movie is a flat out, comic book geek. Whedon knew exactly what the fans wanted and put it all in there. Every single fight sequel has a great flow as well - it feels so real (and keep in mind, you'll be seeing Iron Man go up against a god of thunder - so when I say it looks/feels real, I mean it) The stunts are extremely well choreographed and it becomes clear that a lot of them were done by the actors themselves, which I find very impressive. The CGI was incredible. Some of the stills and trailers had a few cartoony shots, but it all looks amazing on the big screen. If you stick through the credits, you wouldn't be surprised at the amount of people it took to make this movie come to life visually.The dialog and humor... well, what can be said: It's Joss Whedon. It was fantastic. The only dialog that didn't impress me was some of the stuff with Nick Fury (there was also a certain scene with Cap and Stark from the trailers that's been changed, and IMO it didn't really work as well as the original version). I was beginning to feel a little worried that TA would be TOO funny after reading some of the reviews on RT, but it wasn't so. I'll admit, Whedon walked a fine line and it almost ended up being a comedy, but luckily (I think) he maintained the balance... The movie was freakin hilarious though ;)The score was impressive as well. Alan Silvestri composed a heroic orchestra of sounds that just makes you want to start cheering. That said, a few of the songs were a bit too reminiscent of Cap:TFA (which I found a little lazy), but for the most part, the overall score is great (as I'm typing this, I'm still whistling the 'Avengers Theme').The 3D: I thought it was pretty good. It's not necessary that you go see it in 3D, but I'd encourage you to do so. It did add depth to the movie and when you're watching what is (arguably) some of the best fight/battle sequences ever captured on film, you'll be wishing that you could get the full experience. Some of the scenes (very few) were a bit dark/blurry though - but overall, coming from a guy that doesn't really like 3D, I'd say spend the extra few bucks. It's not everyday that the Avengers assemble on the big screen.All-in-all The Avengers was amazing. It's definitely my favorite comic book movie of all time now, and easily one of the top 10 movies I've ever seen. It delivers on all accounts and only has a few, very minor flaws. One of the best aspects of the movie is that it's a roller-coaster ride: it's lighthearted, VERY intense, and then lighthearted again. It's unexpected and I never knew what was coming next. it's funny and serious, often almost at the same time - I was a little exhausted after watching it ;) Don't underestimate the Avengers: while it is mostly an action/adventure movie, it's definitely NOT just another 'mindless popcorn flick'. It does have a sense of depth that I wasn't expecting and the characters do evolve and make you care even more than their solo movies did. Instant classic IMO. 5 out of 5 and it goes without saying, I'm looking forward to seeing more.",10,4,7,11 August 2014
Iron Man 3," A movie that could have been better executed, yet still succeeds in what it wanted to do.
","'Iron Man 3' takes off where 'Marvel's The Avengers' ended. After an invasion by an alien horde, led by the Asgardian Loki, the world is adjusting to the idea of aliens and monsters and gods inhabiting the universe; and our hero, Tony Stark, is left with mental scars and panic attacks after the battle of New York. Not only that, but he now has a few ghosts from his past to take care of as well: a terrorist leader, The Mandarin (who was responsible for Tony's kidnapping and multiple other evil-doings throughout the movies), and Aldrich Killian – a scientist gone mad after an event revolving around Tony Stark and broken promises.This is by far the best character driven movie of all the Marvel movies thus far - which is a nice change of pace. In terms of story, there is quite a few things left to be desired, but if you're not going to nit- pick or analyze it too harshly, you'll enjoy the overall narrative. The pacing was quite brisk, which was fantastic. The previous Iron Man movies had a much steadier pace (and a fairly underwhelming third act), but this beast was the exact opposite: you never know where it's going next and it doesn't ever stop to catch a breath.The main characters were all very well fleshed out. Robert Downey Jr. took his performance to a whole new level. We see such a different side of the character we've grown used to over the past few years, and it worked extremely well... If anything, the end of the movie really makes you wonder where things will go next. Because of that, this movie will 'reignite' many people's interest in this character (other movie franchises such as the Pirates of the Caribbean could learn a thing or two from this). Don Cheadle (Rhodey) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper) had much more important roles this time round, which was great. I don't feel like I have more respect or admiration for the characters after seeing the movie, but it was nice that they were given something to work with besides 'best friend' and 'love interest'. Sir Ben Kingsley's portrayal of The Mandarin character will be a love/hate thing with most, but whichever way you feel, there's no denying it: his actual performance was good. Guy Pearce (Aldrich Killian) kind of played the token 'evil scientist' role. Even his motivations for doing what he does comes across as a cliché, but for the most part, he's an enjoyable character... despite being a little forgettable. The 'kid-helper', Harley Keener, was something I was very nervous about, and the inclusion of such a character could very well have ruined the movie, but oddly, it worked! I'm not a fan of child actors, but this kid didn't come across as the usual 'Oh golly! I'm a little kid helping a superhero!'-type character. It actually felt very real and the chemistry between him and RDJ was great. The other characters weren't given much to do unfortunately... so there isn't really anything worth pointing out on that front.As far as the action and VFX goes, it was insane. Visually, this is a very different movie than any of the other Marvel movies - and I can't stress that enough... DIFFERENT. In a way, it almost felt a little too far out there at times (especially with the ways in which Stark now 'suits up'), but when you have Norse gods and green rage monsters in the same 'world', I think it's a given that people should provide a little leeway if they want to enjoy the ride. Some if the CGI shots seemed overly fake (again, mainly the way in which Stark gets in and out of his suits), but there are plenty of brilliant shots that'll make you forget about those. In terms of spectacle and scale, don't let the early reactions fool you: this isn't as big as The Avengers, or as funny - but it is the closest we might get in a while. For me, the action wasn't as memorable as The Avengers' either. For instance, in The Avengers we had iconic superhero fights and moments, whereas in this one, I couldn't really find any iconic 'poses' or 'moves'.Other aspects of the film: The score was great. It's not as memorable as Ramin Djawadi's score for the first movie, but this one will most definitely go down as one of the more memorable scores in superhero-movie-history. The 3D was surprisingly exceptional. There aren't many pop-out effects, and that's exactly what makes it work so well! It adds depth and makes you feel closer to the characters. In fact, some of the best 3D moments in this movie were during the intimate, dialogue driven scenes. The post credit scene was fun. I'm not going to spoil anything, but it was super fun. That scene at the end really ties the movie up in a nice little bow.One's enjoyment of the movie really depends on where one's loyalties lie. If you're just a casual movie fan, looking for a good time, you'll love this movie. However, if you're a comic book die-hard or a cinephile, I think there might very well be a few things that'll annoy you, and distract you from enjoying the film to its fullest. My advice would be to go into the theater with an open mind, and your expectations dialed down a bit. Also, don't try and compare it to The Avengers (which is what I tried to do) - if you can do that, you'll have a fantastic time.In summation, I'd like to reiterate that this is a wonderful, character- driven film, and extremely different from any of MCU's other films. The director's vision is something that was also apparent throughout. It makes me excited to see what Marvels Studios has in store for us next...",7,0,2,11 August 2014
1917," Joining the pantheon of truly epic war films...
","Centering around 2 young Brittish soldiers, Blake and Schofield, tasked with a simple mission: cross enemy lines, into No Man's Land, and deliver a message to another battilion, countermanding an attack planned for the next day.Should the message not reach the batillion in time, 1,600 men (including Blake's brother) are likely to die at the hands of the Germans who lie waiting to spring their trap... With a refreshingly straightforward, momentum driven narrative, the audience is firmly placed in the trenches, alongside these soldiers as they make their way through the theatre of war.Director, Sam Mendes, and cinematographer, Roger Deakens, achieves this immersive feat by having shot the film to appear as one continous take, from a single viewpoint. The camera follows our heroes closely and without cutting away, through the entire, unrelenting experience - keeping the tension and dread squarely within focus.While the direction and camerawork is without a doubt a technical achievement, the stylistic choices could easily have been considered a gimmick, having the (ironically) adverse effect in taking its audience out of the experience. Thankfully, this is not the case, as the various facets of the production are seamlessly executed with mastery and care. This includes the gritty set pieces that will have your heart pounding at the same rate as the protagonists, holding your breath as they progress through booby trap laden trenches, enemy-infested buildings and perilous river waters.The film's casting should also be commended for having the restraint to put some of Britain's greatest thespians in the smallest of supporting roles. Instead, the film is led by two relatively unknown actors, giving the audience the opportunity to invest fully in the story and characters - without viewing it through the usual, artificial lens of A-list stars.Overall, the entire production is put together with a strong vision ans clear focus.
Immersive, hard hitting and unforgiving - an epic, in the grandest sense of the word. This one is not to be missed and demands to be experienced on the big screen. 10/10",10,1,2,9 February 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," Star Wars for a new generation.
","The movie was incredible! I honestly believe that this will be 'Star Wars' for a new generation of kids... where almost every character is Han Solo.The story wasn't exactly ground breaking, but it was interesting and different enough to keep me guessing and at the end of the day, this movie gives focus to the characters firstly, and the narrative secondarily - which under normal circumstances I disprove of, but in this case it worked.Pros: Rocket was spot on and Groot was the heart of the movie - I mean, every single time Groot did something adorable (which was all the time), I wanted to cry! Definitely 2014's two most awesome team IMO. Chris Pratt's Star Lord was a lot better than I was expecting (and I was expecting him to be hilarious) so as an actor he's gone way up in my 'keep an eye out for that guy' list. Dave Bautista was probably the most surprising part of the movie... I really thought he'd be terrible and stale, but he actually ended up stealing quite a few scenes from the rest of the cast. Other than the actors & characters, the visuals were awesome: It looked fresh and new and colorful world that James Gunn created here really popped and stood out for me. The score was great, and the soundtrack amazing... I can't wait for Vol 2. The humor in the film was also a big surprise... I never thought Disney/Marvel would let Gunn and the cast get away with the shenanigans that they came up with. I mean... semen jokes?!Cons: Gamora was totally unlike the character I've gotten to know in the comics. I guess they wanted a more sympathetic and softer character to counter balance all the rough 'n tumble ones on the team, but for someone who's read GotG and knows Gamora as a character, it was something I just couldn't get used to. Same goes for the Nova corps, but IMO they were just downright lame in this movie - although apparently James Gunn isn't exactly a Nova fan, so obviously not much thought went into that aspect of the story. Lastly, all I can say is that it was a pity that they killed off Ronan so early, which I felt they could have written differently, but aw well. Even though it is connected to the rest of the MCU, it feels like the most stand-alone movie they've made so far, yet surprisingly, there were still references and easter eggs abound (probably more so than any other movie). I mean... Cosmo... the movie had Cosmo!!! All 'n all though, a solid 9 out of 10 and I can't wait to see it again this week... and next week XD",9,1,3,11 August 2014
Toy Story," One of the best animated films of all time
","This wonderful, heart-warming animated film has been considered a classic for many, many years.The story centers around Andy's toys who live happy, fun and peaceful lives, their only concern being birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could replace them. On one such birthday Andy's favourite toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself competing against Andy's new Buzz Lightyear action figure. When rivalries boil over, Woody tries to hide Buzz under Andy's bed, but accidentally pushes him out the window. The other toys exile Woody for this action, which leaves him no other choice, but to find Buzz and bring him back. However, with only two days before Andy's family moves, time is of the essence Not only is Toy Story a terrifically fun 80 minute adventure, but it also speaks about friendship and has underlying themes of what friendship really means and the importance of it. As a matter of fact, almost all aspects of the movie (such as the story, message, animation, voice cast, tone and humour) were extremely well executed. For truth, this really is a great movie for everyone – young and old – and would be an excellent choice for those looking for something light- hearted and family friendly.",10,3,4,11 August 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," An incredible finale to a 3-part, masterpiece story.
","So, The Dark Knight Rises... Starting off with the cast, Christian Bale delivered in all aspects and played the part of Batman/Bruce Wayne much better than in the previous films. He showed so much emotion and pain in this film, and for the first time watching a Batman movie, I felt the urge to stand up and cheer him on. That said, his Batman voice was still wrong and at times he struggled to maintain 'screen-presence' amongst the other actors in the movie during some scenes. Anne Hathaway was a big surprise. I was very unhappy when they announced she would be playing Catwoman and the costume they provided her with wasn't to my liking either, but after seeing the film, I can safely say I was WRONG. Her performance was very memorable and she stole every scene she was in. Michael Cane... well, what can be said about the man. He just blew away expectations and even made me tear up on more than one occasion. Tom Hardy's Bane wasn't as good as it should have though. He did the best he could and he certainly wasn't a bad villain, but his look and voice just didn't work for me (a few people in the audience even started to chuckle when he gave one of his speeches). That said, his brawl with Batman was incredibly powerful and brutal and I'm very glad that they included the iconic moment from the comics. Joseph Gordon-Levitt also stole every scene that he was in and basically carried a big part of the second act. I can't really say that much about him without spoiling parts of the movie, but he was truly exceptional. Sadly, the other actors like Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Marion Cotillard didn't impress me that much. They served their purpose well enough, but seeing as they were meant to serve as crucial parts of the story, I felt let down mostly. The story was great as well, but there were definitely one or two plot holes (and I don't use that term lightly) nearing act 3. I think ultimately, the plot of the movie gave in a little due to its sheer scale. There were too many things going on at certain times and that made the focus of the film shift a little too much. Still, for the most part it was great: very entertaining and emotional. The symbolism of the 'fire rising' will stay with me for a very long time and the ending... well, let's just say it was one of the best endings to a trilogy that I've ever seen.The pacing on the other hand, wasn't that great though. It's one of the few gripes I have with Nolan's films (as much as I love his films). The first act felt rushed and the second act dragged too much for my liking (despite some truly epic scenes). A slightly shorter run-time and a bit more focus on the important scenes would have helped it along much more I think...On to the action! The practical effects were very well done and the CGI was good as well. The thing is though, the balance between practical effects and CGI wasn't always right (too much practical effects in one scene, and too much CGI in the next) which made a few of the CGI moments feel a little too unreal at times. Still, overall it was truly epic. The fight choreography was a big improvement upon the previous films. Catwoman moved and acted fluidly in combat and Batman was, to my surprise, much better as well. His movements still come across as stiff and forced to me, but it is largely due to the suit... His first fight with Bane was almost flawless though.The score by Hans Zimmer accompanied the film very well (much like his previous Batman scores), but it's not something that I'd buy and listen to on its own. One or two of the tracks felt out of place in the specific scenes they were used in, but the other 90% it was wonderful and definitely helped to bring even more gravitas and emotion to the film.In short: I think The Dark Knight Rises is the best of the trilogy, and while I might just be caught up in the scale, emotion and 'epicness' of it all, I doubt my view on the film will change. Whether I'll still feel the same way about the movie after my second viewing, or even in a few years (for instance, the more I watch The Dark Knight, the less I seem to enjoy it), I wouldn't be able to say, but I can say that at the point of writing this, I'd give it a well deserved 9.5 out of 10.",10,1,5,11 August 2014
