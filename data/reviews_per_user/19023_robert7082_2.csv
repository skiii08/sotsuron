Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Samuel L. Jackson steals the pix
","The best scene in this disaster is where Samuel L. Jackson is sitting with the other major actors having a discussion about how they are going to react to something. Although he doesn't say it, YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS THINKING!He is thinking 'what the **** am I doing here?' He is thinking 'this has got to be the most ****** up movie of all time!' He is thinking 'I can't believe these people are actually saying this ****!'It is written all over his face, and it is hilarious. His character is the only one in the movie that 'gets it.'The rest of the movie is pure ****.",1,2,9,8 February 2012
Godzilla," Wait for the MST3K version
","This movie actually starts out with potential. There is a real creepy Japan Fukushima reactor vibe going and tension developing as a nuclear power plant reactor melts down and explodes due to an earthquake and tsunami. Flash forward 15 years. The American consultant to the plant (Bryan Cranston) is still living in Japan obsessed with finding out what really caused the earthquake. The Japanese government has quarantined the facility and surrounding area.Cranston manages to get into the plant just as some subterranean creature is getting out, a Muto. In the process Cranston dies, and so does all logic, reason, and continuity. What follows is a series of incongruous events, each one requiring more suspension of disbelief. Think of Die Hard killing off Bruce Willis in the first 30 minutes, or Rocky killing off Stallone.His son now has to do all the heavy lifting, and he doesn't have a clue.The US military has been reduced to one aircraft carrier, a handful of dysfunctional planes and tanks, and one solitary nuclear weapon to use on the several creatures that feed on nuclear energy. The nuke is so big that it can only travel by train or tugboat, except when it is being helicoptered to the train.The big fight scene between Godzilla and the Mutos occurs at night, and it is so violent that the camera is constantly shaking. Several dark gray creatures, in the dark, surrounded by dark dust, moving in and out of the frame. Did I mention how dark it was? This is a movie where nobody cares about anything. Giant creatures destroying the city and people hardly notice. A giant creature swims under a ship, no big deal. Half a mountain missing, has it always been like that? Golden Gate bridge ripped to shreds; hey we gotta get these kids off this bus right now or their parents will be really upset! The monsters don't seem to care either, everyone's just there for a paycheck.Great CGI of destroyed cities, maybe its a video game disguised as a movie.",1,15,35,16 May 2014
