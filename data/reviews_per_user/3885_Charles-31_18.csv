The Legend of Bagger Vance," Why remake other movies???
","Okay, am I the only one that thinks this is just a golf remake of the Natural, another Robert Redford film?  At least The Natural was a good film. This one falls flat, especially when trying to sell golf as the greatest game in the world.  The Will Smith character was more silly than ethereal and the long presentation of the big championship was almost completely predictable.  The narration was a cover for the lack of effective story telling.  And, we have the first 'post traumatic stress disorder' film for WWI.  The war flashbacks mostly reminded me of Airplane.  Don't waste your time or money.",5,0,1,2 November 2001
Memento," A unique experiment that works brilliantly
","I love experimental films.  But, experimental films often fail to engage because the experiment overwhelms the story or there is no real story to tell.  Timecode is a good example of an experiment that failed.  Memento, on the other hand, is an experiment that succeeds brilliantly.  As you can tell within the first few minutes of the film, this movie tells the story in reverse.  It's almost like they took a conventional movie, cut it into scenes, and played the scenes in reverse order.  This works because you are seeing the world from the eyes of someone who has no short term memory.  As such, this could have been a gimmik.  Instead, it's a tool for telling a complex and fascinating story.  I found myself re-watching many scenes to figure out what had happened and what I had missed, only adding to the experience of the film.  Beware, if you are a lazy, don't bother.  This is a complex film that you'll have to pay close attention to or you just won't get it.",9,0,1,6 January 2002
The Fifth Element," One of the best awful movies I've ever seen...
","I first rated this movie a 6.  It's a fun science fiction film, but has a large number of flaws.  The plot is really lame, the costume range from magnificent to darn right awful, and I dare anyone to name any musical genre that they didn't cram into this film (country, opera, rock, reggae, hula, disco, everything).  There's not a lot that can be said good about this film (except some wonderful costumes, really great sets and effects, and one of the best choreographed fight scenes I've ever seen [Milla Jovovich vs. the aliens]).  But, you find yourself drawn to this film every time it's on (and it's on a lot).  I've seen this film several times in the last month.  I just had to go back and re-rate it an 8 for a level of artistry that transcends the surface weaknesses and makes this darn fun entertainment. 
I do think this film should have gotten an Academy Award nomination for costumes (in spite of the strappy outfit).  Instead, the award when to Titanic, which rented all of the costumes off the rack.  Why must SF, where nearly every costume is an original achievement, always take a back seat to historical films that just rent the stuff already ready to go.",8,1,3,20 February 2002
The Natural," Good overall, but some magical scenes (mild spoiler)
","The Natural is known to be a Holy Grail movie set to Baseball.  And, as such, it's a beautiful movie.  It has interesting characters and a good story.  But, that's not what makes this movie special.  There are three home-run scenes in the film, an initial success, a comeback from adversity, and the triumphant finale.  These are some of the most magnificent and magical moments ever captured on film.  No other movie has ever caught the mystery of baseball in three short scenes as this one has.  Okay, the film is a bit too long and the last scene of the movie is a bit hokey, but if you don't see any other part of The Natural, you will always remember that musical fanfare, showers of sparks, balls that seem to have been given wings, and knowing that there can be magic in a stick of wood.",8,3,6,17 September 2001
Zulu," Good film, but seems too long.
","This is one of American Movie Classic's favorite films.  They run it on a very regular basis.  It's a beautifully shot movie that shows a fascinating part of British history.  Unfortuantly, it seems to go on forever.  I know the running time is only 134 minutes, but I have never watched this film all of the way through.  Instead, I seem to watch 30 minutes here and 20 there and finally saw the entire film after probably a dozen times of overlapping bits.  You just get fatigued after a while.  And, you know it will be back on a dozen times in the month, so you don't worry too much about missing it.",6,5,18,30 November 2001
Saving Private Ryan," What an awful movie (some spoilers)!
","I was looking forward to seeing Saving Private Ryan.  I had heard many reviews that called it one of the greatest war movies ever made.  I was not expecting to see something as poorly put together as this movie was.  From the begining I found myself wanting to scream at the screen.  I must admit the acting was good, but they had little to work with.
Just about every other aspect of the film fails.  It manages to portray D-Day as the smallest battle I've ever seen.  Basically, the goal was two machine gun posts.  Sorry, but that battle was not realistic at all and was intentionally bloodwashed worst than the Friday the 13th movies.  The film is loaded with mistakes including the rediculous helmet rank insignia. They knew better because they told someone not to salute Hanks because it might give away his rank.  Then they put bars on his helmet!  Structurally, the movie was a disaster.  It was supposed to be about the irony of many men dying for one man.  In the end, though it turns into the defense of a bridge and the main plot is almost totally forgotten.  The soldiers are stupid. They have to defend or destroy a bridge, but don't leave the detonator wired up and someone (who should have been Ryan) to blow it as a last resort? Every war cliche in the book gets dropped into this film.  'Save my child', the wounded soldier just out of reach, the sharpshooter who never misses, 'I'm not leaving my buddies', etc.  They are all there.  Did they have to end the the waiving of the flag?The movie does not feel like WWII, but rather feels like Vietnam.  Lots of mud and rain, 'what are we doing here', a bungling military command.  One of the most successful engagements in military history is portrayed as a confused, poorly planned mess.The movie is absolutely loaded with red herrings.  Hank's hand problem has no bearing on the plot and is not present when it might cause a problem. They fight a machine-gun nest for no real reason other than it provided a fight scene.  Was I the only one to notice that all of the towns were destroyed before we even got to them?  Didn't France surrender?  The climactic battle is sure to be lost, but is won when air support arrives. Of course, they did not call for the air support.  Can you say 'Deus ex machina'?  Did we have precision guided tank bombs in WWII?  Did our protagonists really have anything to do with the outcome?I was shocked that this movie was not ripped apart in reviews.  It has everything possible wrong with it.  Is it now unpatriotic to indicate divel when you see it wrapped with an American flag?",1,65,149,7 November 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," The 'Titanic syndrome'...
","The think this movie is another great example of the 'Titanic syndrome'.  A movie comes out that everyone knows will have to be really, really bad. Then, it turns out to not completely stink and suddenly it's the best movie ever made.  Titanic is the perfect example.  The prerelease news made it clear that it was a movie out of control and the previews showed just about the dumbest parts of the movie (yes, the ship is sinking, but we're running around with guns shooting at each other).  Then, it turned out to be 'okay' and everyone just went crazy.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is much like that.  Okay, it's a Kung Foo film, so it has to be bad.  But, hey, it's not that bad after all.  Wow!  It must be great.  And, in many ways it is great.  The settings are magnificent, the acting is very good, and it's fun to hear the original language.  But, structurally, the movie has many problems.  The character focus shifts rather arbitrarily, the large flashback seriously damages the flow of the story, and the plot is weighed down with elements that are not at all supported (why is the sword so special, for example).  And, then there's the much talked-about fight scenes.  I'm sorry, but I thought I was watching a cross between Xena and The Matrix.  Everyone seems to be able to fly.  Every fight seen was filmed with actors hanging on wires.  There's not explaination as to how they can do this, you just have to take it for granted and it looks so incredibly fake all of the time.  Xena is camp and the Matrix provides a framework for the violation of gravity.  This movie does not.",3,0,0,18 June 2001
K-19: The Widowmaker," Nuclear weapons do not go off accidentally
","Okay, everyone, let's say it together and hopefully a clich√© cold war plot line can be finally put to rest:             Nuclear weapons do not go off accidentally!             Nuclear weapons do not go off accidentally!             Nuclear weapons do not go off accidentally! During the cold war the Soviets lost 8 nuclear submarines, all armed with nuclear weapons.  They had fires, explosions, collisions and all sorts of accidents.  How many accidental nuclear explosions were there?  NONE!  The US lost submarines and crashed several bombers loaded with nuclear weapons. Once, an American nuclear missile exploded in its silo, blasting the hardened lid off the silo and sending the charred warhead crashing to the ground several hundred yards away.  There wasn't even a radiation leak.  The US actually put nuclear weapon prototypes on rocket sleds and in fires to ensure their safety.  I'm sure the Russians did the same.  Movies like K19 continue to rely on the myth that a fire or other accident might set off the nuclear weapons, thus triggering World War III.  In reality, K19 might have caused an environmental disaster, but it would not have destroyed a NATO ship and base due to the fire or the radiation.  Nuclear weapons are complex devices that require a specific set of actions to detonate them.  Were it possible to set one off by accident, it would have happened by now.Before you see this movie, be sure to check out the comments of the actual crew of K19, who all condemn the movie as stupid, inaccurate, and insulting. As an example, they never called the K19 'The Widowmaker'.  After all, the average crew member was 20 years old and for all who died only one widow was left behind.  Why make a 'historical' film if it's all fiction?",1,19,35,25 July 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Good half a film
","Okay, I've heard the usual 'you'll love it or hate it' comments about this film.  I'm actually right in the middle.  If the film had maintained the intensity it had in the first half, it would have been a good (not great) film.  Instead, it decays badly.  And, doesn't everyone groan when they hear those contemporary songs twisted and forced into this movie?  I couldn't bear to watch the tango version of Roxanne (you don't have to put out that red light...).  Oh, and if you're going to fill your film with familiar music, don't write some extra original slop like 'Come What May' as obvious bait for an Oscar nomination.",5,0,1,6 January 2002
"Girl, Interrupted"," A powerful psychological drama...
","I was very impressed with this film.  Not only was it a powerful story about recovery from mental illness, it avoided all of the cliche's we normally expect in these films (no bit electric shock scene, no rape, no persistent drugged state, thank you, thank you, thank you...).  The only negative of this film is that the hair and clothing do a poor job of evoking the time period.  Only the music and occasional news references remind you of that during the bulk of the film.  It was just a miss.",10,0,0,12 August 2000
A Beautiful Mind," Fabulous film with an extra stroke of brilliance
","I was very much impressed with the acting and presentation of this movie. But, what I really want to point out is what I consider one of the most brilliant examples of slight of hand in a movie that I have ever seen.  **** minor spoiler alert ****  It is sad that we have become conditioned to stupidity in film making.  Nuclear weapons can accidentally detonate, guns never seem to run out of ammunition, the CIA can do anything, etc.  When Ron Howard presented me with a cold-war code breaking scenario involving a German nuclear bomb, I knew it was nonsense and fully accepted that something so dumb could be put into a movie by an otherwise savvy director. Of course, it turns out to not exist.  This trick very much impressed me. It showed that Ron Howard is aware that we are conditioned to stupidity and was willing to use that against us, thereby exploiting a weakness in the viewer that expands the range of illusion.  Later, he tricks us again when we realize that the illusions are not always so well telegraphed.  If was this element of A Beautiful Mind that most impressed me.  Yes, this film works on many other levels, but it took this extra stroke of brilliance to earn a 10/10 from me.",10,0,1,7 August 2002
Blow," All of the look and feel of a TV movie
","There are many good comments about this film, pointing out the weaknesses of the plot and many performances and noting a strong effort by Johnny Depp to keep a dull script alive.  But, the main thing I noticed about this film was how much it looked and felt like a low-budget made-for-television movie.  It did not belong on the big screen at all.",5,1,2,28 March 2002
Shrek," Great fun...
","I really get tired of the movies my kids want to watch.  It was only because I was bored when my kids started watching this the fourth time that I saw it and I was very pleasantly surprised.  Shrek is fun to watch with never a boring moment, and that's what really counts in a film like this.  The story is strong, the actors deliver believable performances, and the flow is excellent.  It even has the occasional adult-oriented joke or comment.  (I loved 'Dead broad off the table')The only two negatives of this film are that the actual story is a bit short and the animation is not up to the usual Pixar standards.  The story came in too short, so they stuck on the 'Shrek in the swamp Karaoke party'.  This, of course, is a massive hit with my kids who played it about 100 times, but it's not at all part of the story, it's padding.  I would have preferred if they had left it as a fun addition after a full-length film. 
The animation was a bit surprising.  The textures were often very 2 dimensional and shadows were generally wrong.  I wonder if part of this is due to having to reanimate and rerender Shrek due to Mike Myers decision to redo his voice with a (not very good) Scottish accent.But, aside from this minor nitpicks, this is great and fun film.  It's not Gone with the Wind, but it beats the heck out of so much of the garbage Hollywood has been spewing in recent years.",8,0,0,12 November 2001
The Sixth Sense," Would have been better without the trailer
","This is clearly one of the best horror films ever made.  It accomplishes good fright without a lot of gore.  However, it has some weaknesses that still bother me and clearly do not make it an Oscar contender with such great films as American Beauty and Girl Interrupted.  The first flaw is not in the film, but in the trailer.  Yes, 'I see dead people' is an enticing line, but I would have given anything to see this movie without knowing that in advance.  It really detracted from the early suspense.  And, the big surprise ending I hear about is so obvious that I thought the surprise might be that the obvious ending didn't occur (and this would have made it a better film).  Unfortuantly, the obvious does happen and they use very heavy-handed flashbacks to make sure even the dumbest in the audience get the idea.Other than these flaws, it's an excellent film.",7,0,0,12 August 2000
The Replacements," Every cliche in the book
","This film is actually quite amazing in two ways.  First, there is the use of the cliche.  I wracked my brain trying to think of some sports movie cliche that they missed using, but could not think of a one.  The 'team of misfits', the evil professionals who refuse to accept them, the 'hidden talents', the 'soccer kicker who would be a great football player', the love interest that has nothing to do with the story, the fickle fans, and even the classic bar fight.  They are all here.  In fact they are the entire story.  Just take every sports movie cliche you can think of, toss them in a hat, and dump them on the ground.  Instant script.The other amazing thing about this movie is it's predictability.  It's common that you'll be watching a movie and have a good idea of what is going to happen next.  In this movie, you always know everything that is going to happen.  The script telegraphs every move.  Don't expect to be surprised, it won't happen.What's really strange is that you will enjoy watching this movie.  The antics are funny, the cast is wacky, and the cheerleaders are fun.  Don't expect to be surprised by anything other than this fact and you'll walk away happy you saw The Replacements.",3,5,12,18 June 2001
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Best in a theater (minor spoiler)
","I'll not add to the praise of this movie except to say that it is sad that so few will get the experience of seeing this movie in the theater.  I went to Monty Python and the Holy Grail when it was released and not knowing much about Monty Python.  It's a fabulously silly film that I still find myself quoting today.  (minor spoiler here) But, there was nothing quite like the ending, where the screen when blank, the curtain closed, and the lights came on.  It was such an abrupt shock it took a few minutes to get oriented. That's lost when you see it television or DVD.  BTW, don't watch this on network television.  When you take out the good parts it's just not as much fun.  Rent the DVD.",10,1,1,19 November 2001
Contact," Awful, awful, awful...
","I'm always shocked to read so many good reviews of Contact, particularly among people claiming to be SF fans.  This movie was one of the worst SF movies ever made.  It really should have had Peter Graves in it just for the theme.  It was Carl Sagen telling us that we are stupid and he is not.  I found myself wanting to yell at the screen during the movie many times when the entire planet's field of experts could not seem to figure out something that was so obvious to me.  The 'religious' elements of the story were just plain dumb.  Does anyone recall there being a belief test for astronauts before?  What was really amazing was that this religious extremism on the part of the government was supposed to be happening during the Clinton administration.  There was not one believable character in the government plot.There was no hint of scientific method.  The science was just plain bad.I'm reminded of many Star Trek episodes where someone says they heard voices or saw a vision.  The are immediately discounted as having stress problems or some other mental problem.  This on a ship where this type of stuff happens all the time.  This movie does this as well.  It protrays the entire world as not willing to pay any attention to what someone says when it's unexpected.  What did they expect?  I could go on and on and about Contact.  It's just so amazing to me that so many people turned off their brains and went into dreamland while watching it.  It's a seriously bad movie.",1,83,196,13 March 2000
Beetlejuice," One of the most fun half-movies ever made
","This movie is well worth watching, though I think the problem more often is accomplishing NOT watching it during one of its 30-40 showings a week on Comedy Central, WGN, TBS, TNT, or the Disney Channel.I find myself watching Beetlejuice every now and then when it comes on, but have noticed that I always turn it off half-way through.  The opening of this movie, with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as the daffy and clueless Maitlands, then the fun advent of Catherine O'Hara as the ditzy artist without a clue and Jeffrey Jones as her suffering and pretentious husband is an absolute riot.  As the Maitlands try to run these flakes out of their home we get a thoroughly wacky view of the afterlife.  I must admit I'm not that thrilled with the stereotypically Goth character in Winona Ryder (she is capable of much better).  But, this stuff is darn fun.  The scenes in the afterlife office are particularly fun.Then Michael Keaton positively steals the show.  And, he should be arrested for it.  Keaton plays 'the ghost with the most', an obvious stand-up act that takes over the remainder of the movie.  Any possibilities for interesting scenes are robbed by an endless tirade of 'I'm gross' jokes. He's not that bad at it, but it's BORING.  You rapidly get fatigued and tune it out.  It's like they decided to take several strong actors and turn them all into props.  It ruins the entire second half of the movie.",6,5,12,17 September 2001
