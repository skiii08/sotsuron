The Blair Witch Project," Scared .....
","This is the scariest, most realistic horror movie to come out in forever. Halfway through I was trying to remember if my friend said it was real or not.  I was hoping not, but I was thinking it was.  I was lucky enough to see it on a video that my friend had.  It was great.  The actors made you feel that you were there with them, and they did everything the way most people would've done it in that situation.  It's nice to know that other people think that good horror movies can be made without T&A and gore everywhere.  The 'documentary' was the coolest idea, and I hope everyone goes and sees it when it comes out.  It is a must see for mentally sound adults who like horror movies and don't like camping.

The Blair Witch Project," Damn!
","On a scale of 1-10, this gets an 11.  This is one of the best movies I think I've ever seen.  I just kept trying to remember the whole time whether my friend told me it was real or fake.  It doesn't take gore and breasts to make a good horror flick, and these people proved it.  The images in the last 15 minutes of the movie stayed in my head for days.  Check out the web page and the sci-fi channel documentary, you won't be disappointed.",Null,1,1,31 July 1999
