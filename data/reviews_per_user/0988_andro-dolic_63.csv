Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This is so good and hilarious comedy which is maybe provocative
",I can't remember when I last time saw some really funny comedy . Maybe I can put here Meet the Parents or Yes Man but I have never seen something like this . Very funny and so hilarious comedy . That is Borat!I think that this is the best comedy in 2006 or longer . This is something what do we call great comedy . Maybe director chose one discussable theme but I enjoyed . There are so many parts which laughed me . I was so impressed with it . This whole restriction are political thing because maybe Kazahstan is showed on one special way but I think that they are needless . You can see so much great parts when sometimes Borat's learning of culture is really funny . In some scenes I almost peed myself of laughing . I liked scene when Borat entered in hotel with street style or when he was on culture lesson . You can really see what is comedy made by heart . It isn't something forced . I think that it is very good and spontaneous comedy . I liked it so much . This movie is really great . Sacha Baron Cohen is really funny actor which made this movie great .,10,0,2,8 May 2010
3:10 to Yuma," Good and modern western
","Remakes are usually missed thing . They are only chance to make original alive . There are very rare good remakes because of bad sense by directors of today's time . I could see that this western no matter what I don't like this genre is simply good . Modern and full of gripping fights it is reminding us on old times and it is packed in one modern movie . Attracting facts about movie like cast and good trailer . There are few things which I don't like . There were maybe too many some frivolous fights . I don't like westerns because their plot which is too complicated .Russel Crowe as Ben Wades was very good and I like his acting very much . I think that in every his movie he is some great lover and that is the only stupid thing in his acting . Great discipline and his acting is sometimes on level of John Wayne . He was simply good . I even didn't hope that he will be so good and so precious . His job was pretty hard because he didn't have too much fighting scenes like Gladiator or new Robin Hood . I don't know if director wanted him to be some new western master like John Wayne,Clint Eastwood or Kirk Douglas . He had style and he didn't show some violent Australian acting but I like their acting .Christian Bale also as leading role was impressive . Actually he is my favorite actor . I like his performances from Batman franchise and Public Enemies . He was surprisingly good because he showed great maturity . He was sometimes out of pace but I like last fighting scene when he gave his best and made great excitement with Crowe's great possibilities . He was simply good but maybe not on the level of Russel Crowe . There were also many other actors but they couldn't improve great atmosphere made by Bale and Crowe . Nice remake .",7,0,0,21 May 2010
The Hangover," Funny,funnier,the funniest
","Great comedy cannot be seen every day on TV or maybe in cinema . They are very rare but now I believe that Hangover is real example that everything is so far from us . When you watch this movie you understand that comedies on TV are frivolous . This movie is really fun show and you cannot be calm during the watching the movie . Almost every scene has got laughs and funny parts . Doug and his company were so crazy that you may can think that they can ruin whole world . Every comedy which you see after this will be maybe frivolous , stupid and monotone . Before watching the movie that it will be child's play but it isn't . This movie is so good so funny and you will want to watch it again . I liked the most Alan who is not such well known in the company but he was so cool and I liked the scene when he saw tiger and when Mike Tyson kicks him . Every member of company was so daft and so funny that you won't believe that you are watching such good movie .",9,1,2,17 March 2010
In Bruges," What is this?
",In newspapers they wrote that genre of this movie is comedy but I am not sure . Colin Farrell was very good but he cannot make this movie great . There are many things which I didn't understand . First which genre is this movie ? Crime ? No. Action ? I am not sure . Drama ? Close to drama.Thriller? I cannot see why . Comedy ? Definitely not . Then what is? Second why is it such good movie ? Why is it so good rated ? Third what is the point of the movie ? Maybe I was too strict . Movie has good parts but they aren't well connected . I really enjoyed in views of Bruges . Movie is illuminated but there are some parts which aren't enjoyable . I can see that it is made with some black humor which has dramatic and i can tell tragic parts.,5,2,8,27 February 2010
Kung Fu Panda," Attracting funny and wise
","When I realized that I don't like so much cartoons I watch maybe one just to see why are them so popular . I watched this movie and I really enjoyed . There aren't so many animated movies in which you can meet famous faces like Jack Black , Dustin Hoffman , Jackie Chan and Angelina Jolie . This is I think maybe the top of animated movies because there aren't so many movie for which I gave 8 . It is very imaginative and illuminating . I liked this whole funny movements of Panda but in same time there are also dramatic and illuminating parts . This animals are very well made and director of this movie had really big imagination for this movie . You can also expect that you can find yourself in some animals . I enjoyed when Panda learned kung fu and when he beats the enemy with his mentor Shifu . I am recommending this movie to everyone because it is one of the most imaginative animated movies ever .",8,0,1,9 April 2010
Meet the Parents," Strong performance by two leading roles
",I was watching this movie on TV and I think that it is real entertainment for whole family or maybe for some couple because it is so funny and it has two great leading roles . Of course they are Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro . I really enjoyed in this comedy and it is one rare comedy in which you can laugh . I didn't like what other actors were maybe too calm but whole story was very well connected and so funny .Ben Stiller maybe confused but he played his role on high level . It was really enjoyable to watch him in this role . He always makes movie funny when he is doing something in which he isn't good . In this movie it is babysitting .DeNiro was also damn good because he was playing retired agent and he was doubting whole time . He is funny with his calm humor . I liked the part when he is testing Gaylord . It wasn't his best performance but it was OK.,7,1,3,9 April 2010
The Big Lebowski," Strong performances but where is heart of this movie
",The Big Lebowski is completely good . That is what I heard from one person who recommended me this movie . More one fact attracted me . Brothers Coen directed this movie . But I am pretty disappointed . This movie has nice beginning but as movie was going I was becoming more and more disappointed . This comedy hasn't some too funny parts . Two leading roles were quite good but plot is stupid . I couldn't believe that Coen brothers directed it . There are so imaginative stupid parts . Jeff Bridges was totally good and that's why I like his acting . Goodman was also good . I don't like some stupid details like carpet and I am disappointed with again Jewish details . Oh I can't believe . I am not fond of this movie . I watched Serious Man and this movie is reminding me on it . I am going to watch No Country For Old Men on DVD . I hope that it will be good .,5,6,13,2 May 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Excellent and genius
","This movie when I heard for it first time didn't attract me so much . There weren't so much attracting details . Everybody who watched this movie told that it is great but then I thought that it is overrated . There wasn't any movie which has got something in common with this movie. I didn't watch many black comedies but actually I wasn't so interested into them . Maybe there aren't so much bad critics about it . I wasn't fond of this movie but I didn't want to say anything because I didn't watch it and I didn't want to watch it . But then I was fed up of all good critics and Academy Award nominations . I was definitely convinced that I have to watch it . There is no so much good movies which had 8 nominations so I decided to watch it . But I was prepared for disappointment because there are some movies which have got many nominations for Oscar like Up in the Air and Serious Man . Was I disappointed ? No .In this movie I saw that everyone who likes action,comedy and blood will enjoy in this movie . Maybe it isn't so enjoyable but I really found myself into this movie . I think that this movie is basic for making good comedy and every director of comedies should watch it . After this movie I realized that black comedies are very good and funny. This movie can be also described as some kind of parody . It is very well showed details from World War II . There are very funny details and many blood as you can expect . There is nothing to loose if you watch this movie . It is very entertaining and I realized that it is attractive but on strange way . Cast isn't so well known but they did they job excellently . There aren't boring parts and this movie is mix of every genre . There are some dramatic moments and some fights which are reminding me on western . I don't like this kind of movies but after watching this movie I understood that they can be very good .Quentin Tarantino directed this movie . I liked the way how he can be so convincing in his directing . His action scenes are maybe bloody but they are so well made that you can enjoy in every bit of it . He wants his movie to be bloody and World War II was chance of his lifetime . He didn't miss . He made this movie that I can't still believe . He is so convincing that I started to enjoy in every scene no matter on blood . I wasn't fond of this kind of movies but Tarantino made this movie that I can now enjoy in every bit of this kind of movies . In this movie is something so attractive and so good which is making this movie one of the best movies in 2009 . There is no wasting time and Tarantino found himself in new kind of movies . Damn good directing .Female part of cast in this movie was very good . Better to say unexpected good . I was really impressed how they fit into their roles. They are reminding me on old times when women were attractive but in this movie they are good but on the other side very dirty . You can really enjoy in their performance but there is maybe something what is not specific for women in this time . That is their provocative and sarcastic side . There is something very funny in their performance but you don't know how they were maybe too good for their role . They had to play villain but in the other side heroes . I liked their performance .Brad Pitt was also unexpected . He was very good . I didn't expect so good performance . He had to play American and that was role of his lifetime . He was calm but funny and good on American way . He maybe wasn't so good in ending but I liked his expressions and sense for ordering and merciless behavior . When he said to Hans Landa will he wear his uniform whole life I saw that it is top of his acting . His calm sense for humor . I don't think that he is over-provision . He is very good and he showed it in this movie . I think that this black comedies are his kind of movies .Cristoph Waltz was definitely the best part of the movie and I liked his performance . I am impressed and he was undetected talent until this movie . He was so good and so funny like everyone in this movie . Every his appearance was funny . He has got great sense for humor was the best part of this movie . His acting impressed me so much . The way how he acted in this movie was impressive . I liked the part when he started to speak Italian and nobody understood him . He was very good detective and he saw everything . He was calm and damn funny . This movie is great parody and I am recommending it to everyone who likes great action and great humor with smart directing by Tarantino An strong performance by Waltz and Pitt .",10,4,10,10 April 2010
Iron Man 2," Excellent again
","I am big lover of superhero movies and I really enjoy in them and it looks like I found myself in them . I like when I see Batman,Spiderman or maybe Iron Man . I was very surprised when last year I read article in newspapers that in 2010 is coming Iron Man 2 . This is one of the most expected movie in this year . I am surprised with more one fact . Why is movie coming a week earlier in Europe than in USA . I decided that I will watch this movie because I expected it so long . Then I saw trailer in cinema and I knew that it will be something spectacular . I was so excited and I didn't want to miss it .When I saw this movie I knew it that I can't be disappointed . Whole first impressions were great and I thought that I will again watch one masterpiece . This movie is something what I can't miss . There are maybe few things which made this movie a bit worse but I don't mind it .Jon Favreau directed this movie and he acted Happy Hogan . His directing is always full of imagination and great sense for entertainment . His funny appearance entertained me . I can still say that he didn't screw this serial . I can also say that his directing was completely different from first one because from one simple movie we got one big astonishment . I knew that i can't be disappointed with his directing . I can still say that his connecting of every part was on higher level and he got the best from whole cast .Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man was again excellent . Looks like he is enjoying in acting of this superhero . I can see that he isn't missing chance of his life because now he showed how he can be so good . Actually I like his performance from Sherlock Holmes and Iron Man . His sense for fun and great action made this movie great . I couldn't believe that from one I can say boring acting to great relaxed acting . He is again showing simplicity of one superhero . He was so realistic .Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko was great . No matter what I liked performance by Jeff Bridges but Rourke was definitely better . He made this movie great . His damn good performance deserved award 'The Best Villain in 2010' . I can say that every his appearance was superb . If someone made this movie more amusing than first that was him . I think that he is definitely great choice by Jon Favreau . His convincing acting and something what is called sense for acting was great . I can see that he was on level .Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts was again in one difficult role and she acted her role the best that she could . I can see that she was on level maybe sometimes she had some failures but again something what we could see in first part . Her role was difficult but she found herself in it . Maybe she wasn't the best part of movie but I can't say that her performance is bad . She sometimes was in some her world but good performance .Don Cheadle as War Machine or Rhody was pretty convincing . His acting was in some cool style and I was fond of it . He surprised me so much because I didn't expect strong performance by him . There were so much parts when he was on level . I was surprised because he made big progress because of weak performance by Terrence Howard in first part . He was also great choice by Jon Favreau . I think that this movie is really better made .Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman was pretty good . She had good performance no matter what her appearance was based on her beauty what is definitely truth . Maybe sometimes she had some downs but many times she had her ups . I was very surprised because she was in some hand entertaining . Her movements were good and every scene was delighted with some her sense for appearance . I think that she is so good actress .Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury wasn't so good but he had a style . He is definitely valuable actor and you can see how his sense for acting .I think that this movie was the best of superhero movies .",7,18,38,1 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Imaginative vision
",Dead Man's Chest is maybe something better than first one but there isn't any bigger progress . It is sometimes very exciting but sometimes it looks like imagination didn't pass in some ideas . Gore Verbinski with some childish vision of curious monsters passed . Sometimes it was a bit uninteresting and too monotone but sometimes really big fun . Cast didn't disappoint but sometimes they are too unprofessional . Johnny Depp is again the best part of movie . He has really got this sense for this kind of movies . Keira Knightley was maybe more mature but it wasn't enough . Orlando Bloom was amusing on his strange way but he is maybe not for something like this . This was something better than I expect but it isn't enough for some progress .,7,0,1,1 April 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Disneys classic story
",As children everyone liked Disney everybody liked Disneys stories . This one was very impressive and maybe curious . Pirates of Caribbean are bringing some new dimension and the are really entertaining . This is one good classic and I really liked it . Scenes were impressive and they are well made . Whole movie is very adventurous and it is so good . Maybe movie will look like some fairytale but it is so attractive that I wanted to watch and other movies from this serial . Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow had stunning performance . Keira Knightley was also very good but maybe sometimes too childish . Orlando Bloom didn't impress me so much because of his maybe too uninteresting performance . Other characters were looking simply good . This movie in comparison with others is maybe too simply.,7,0,3,1 April 2010
Public Enemies," Mann's vision passed
",It is always hard to interpret some theme which is very popular . Michael Mann took one very hard theme . Every person has different vision of the history . It is always good when you see many visions because you know then why is your different . I didn't expect some explosion of ideas . I expected one mature adaptation of the history . Movie was very good but in some scenes Depp's dose of humor is too big and sometimes it is too abstruse . Sometimes you can't expect some excitements . There are some scenes which are very well done and you then understand that this movie is good . You cannot even tell that this movie is bad interpretation of history of the criminal .Johnny Depp as John Dillinger should be awarded for his acting of notorious criminal . His acting was very convincing . In some scene he is becoming too sarcastic . Good side is that he enjoyed acting criminal . I like his movies and way how he can transform from pirate to bad criminal. Looks like he didn't loose sense for acting . He was damn good and I liked his acting . You can enjoy because he knows how to mix every acting in only one role . He did it . Very well.Christian Bale also one of my most favorite actors as Melvin Purvis . It was really hard to find yourself in this kind of roles . He was so cool and he enjoyed in this acting . He was so mysterious and so perfect that I didn't expect something like this . Every his role is very hard but he found himself . You cannot tell that he was bad . Maybe it was looking that he is confused but he was really mature and it was very convincing . With this two convincing acting you cannot find yourself in this movie so easy .This was really good historical thriller . Everything was so perfect . I really liked it .,8,0,0,31 March 2010
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Meltdown is really funny and nice part of Ice Age serial
",You can see how first part is very illuminating but I wanted to watch second one because this theme attracted me so much . Maybe it isn't following other parts but its heart is emptier than first one . There are very funny parts and there are maybe some parts which are bringing us new vision of this funny serial . You can find yourself in every part of this funny adventure . Maybe it isn't so well made as I expected . You can see that authors of this movie were inspired with one actual global problem . This movie is showing how this animals are reacting in this climate change . It is maybe way how you can find inspiration and from problem make really funny and nice part in every animated serial . Sid and whole team impressed me because they are again here in this friendship .,7,1,1,8 April 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Surprisingly good and effective
",You know this curse . Games made by movie are bad and movies made by games are also bad . This is something what didn't stop me to go watch this movie . Trailer wasn't something attracting but I heard that it is entertaining . There are lot of prejudices but Prince of Persia(game) was definitely big mania . I knew few guys who were crazy about this game . This is nice beginning for this promising movie . Is it another trash with silly effects ? Definitely not . Far from this . Plot maybe isn't so great but its realization is definitely good . Actually I like movies from Disney . This movie is even better than one of my favorite serial Pirates of Caribbean . Great effects in this movie and really thrilling fight scenes are great . I don't mind what maybe showing of Persia was a bit childish .Jake Gyllenhal as Dastan was surprisingly good . When you see few his movie you can never expect that he could act this hero . I thought that he will act it only on some character way but he had nice improvisation and he handled himself in every scene . You can see that his image is really good . You can't tell that his acting wasn't convincing . Really entertaining acting which didn't show any suffers . It is also on level of Johnny Depp(Jack Sparrow).There weren't some mistakes and in romantic scenes he was also great and he didn't screw . He acted with heart . He was for this roles and it was on level of this fantasy movies inspired by games . This movies always have to be some kind of fairytale .Gemma Arterton as princess was also surprisingly good . She is always in roles of some wise princess . You can't even imagine how this acting was convincing . It wasn't like Io in Clash of the Titans when she was like some forced role . I can't understand that she was so good . She was also attractive and she was really like one historical beauty . She really looked like sign of female strength . I think that it was one of her better performances .Ben Kingsley as Nizam was also great . I expected good performance from him . After also one villain role in Shutter Island I could only expect the best and I got . Again one provocative acting with heart and soul . You can see that he is profiled actor with many different roles . From greatest heroes to most notorious villains . It was really nice to see him in this role . I think he was very inspired .All in one really entertaining movie . I like this genre of adventure spectacle . If you didn't watch this movie what are you waiting for ?,7,0,3,13 June 2010
Batman Returns," Batman returned but Burton didn't
",Everything was far of the best . I was disappointed with this Burton's movie in Batman franchise . Maybe it is good but Burton was again imaginative but for me in wrong way . It looks that Nicholson kept the first part in very good atmosphere . Now we had Danny DeVito . Michelle Pfeiffer was maybe very confused but she had very good transformation . I didn't like ending because of fighting in canalization when Penguin died on maybe silly way . I didn't like and dose of action because there are some maybe annoying action . Soul of the movie was empty . That was because Burton now made some childish play . He maybe cared too much on costumes and visual performance . I still think that it is annoying in visual part . Keaton as Batman returned because he followed his way of acting from first part . I don't like this movie so much . Burton disappointed me .,6,0,2,5 April 2010
Finding Nemo," Finding Nemo is thrilling family movie
",I watched in cinema and I really know that Pixar did it very well maybe too well . Is it bad ? No . Why did it get 8 when it is great ? This movie is something what you cannot forget . Maybe there are many parts which saddens me . I was really impressed with this movie .Nemo was really good and this whole adventure entertained me on good way. You can really enjoy in every bit of it . Maybe you can find yourself in this movie . You can really enjoy and you want to watch it more once . This is classic and good movie . Must watch and definitely Top 250 .It is so thrilling movie and you can really enjoy in it . It is nice way how ocean world is showed . Maybe it is so good that you can't tell that it is bad . Maybe there are some parts which are standing on place .But it is very good 8 out of 10,8,0,2,5 April 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," The best in serial
",After two very imaginative parts it came the most imaginative . Maybe it isn't following system from first two parts but good thing is that it is bringing us new division of one of the best serial of adventure movies . It is very exciting and plot is wisely made and it is very complicated . Maybe there are some parts when movie is bad . There are some boring parts and that's why I maybe don't appreciate this movie so much . Cast is now very mature and they really surprised me . Johnny Depp is again the best part of the movie . I was impressed with his funny performance . He was so good . Keira Knightley is now more mature but she is still bringing us this movie on maybe too dramatic way . Orlando Bloom is again some macho pirate and he is maybe more worried with his look . Geoffery Rush as Barbossa again showed very good potential for this movie and he is so good . This is my best movie in this serial .,8,0,2,1 April 2010
Yes Man," Vivacious Carrey in chance of his life
","It is fun to watch Jim Carrey which can smile everybody in this world . Everybody remembered his acting in Ace Ventura and Dumb and Dumber . He is always damn good . Is he and now ? Yes,of course . There are so many funny parts . Maybe it is sometimes reminding us on some bad modern fairytale . Vivacious Carrey was damn good . He has got some sense for humor and when it is mixed with his sense for kidding . I didn't like other actors from cast which made this movie a bit worse . There are so convincing parts and smart humor . It is good how Carrey is doing his job and this performance . You can tell that this movie is bad but then you don't know appreciate Carrey's funny side . I am recommending this movie to everyone who likes Carrey and great comedy . He is The king of comedy.",8,1,1,12 April 2010
The Expendables," Great chance for summer blockbuster
","Summer in movie dictionary is period when there are movies which are going to fight for every dollar . Quality of movies is great but gross and strange opinion by public are going to smash point of movies . In Croatia it is similar opinion . I can't understand why people like only Twilight . Seems like it is only movie which can attract people . But, summer still can be great with movies like Toy Story 3,Inception,Salt and Expendables .Now,about movie . This movie is really great theme for every 'movie man' because so many old school stars can't be found on one place . This is great return of Stallone is really biggest surprise . Since I saw trailer before 3 months I didn't want to waste time and I set it as my priority . I am not big lover of hardcore movies . Rambo or similar movies aren't so good for me because they are only adrenaline bombs . But,after this movie I changed my views and I was astonished with formula which is attracting watchers . If girls like Twilight and Sex and the City men can like Expendables . This is real enjoy for men .Sylvester Stallone is director and leading role . For this project he prepared himself very well . But,main problem of movie is that in quality of plot and scenario is bad . It is still missing some quality dialogues . Seems that we will still have to wait for some all round movie . Stallone as Barney was just as mix of world's finest fighters . It wasn't close to Rambo and it was not close even to Rocky . So,now when we mention Stallone we can remember even Barney Ross . Still , he brought great crime themes in movie . I like style of making movie . Really, all your senses are going to blow up how energetic this movie is .Jason Statham as Lee Christmas was the biggest surprise . maybe in one nonsense role he is still rising quality of movie . It is bringing sometimes humorous and sometimes very brutal acting . That is just like someone would expect from this hardcore movie . In this movie we couldn't expect so important and so great performance by Statham .Jet Li as Ying Yang was also one of real protagonists . I didn't like his sometimes irritating appearance . He was maybe too usual for that kind of movie . Stallone maybe wanted to choose all round cast . I definitely wanted some better performance because this was just a bit pity .Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen was awesome . After his famous role of Drago in Rocky 4 I expected some killing machine performance . It was very mental role and he didn't have space to act maniacally brutal killer . First time I felt that he is quality actor .Randy Couture as Toll Road wasn't so bad . He didn't have something special to show but quality of movie was bigger with his appearance . Stallone made a great job with this choice . His parts were always delighted with dose of humor .Eric Roberts and Sean Austin as villains didn't look so notorious but I still can stand their performances . Maybe for some kind of great criminal they should prepare better .They didn't look so convincing but I think that maybe it wasn't so bad .Mickey Rourke as Toll was great and very funny . It seems like old school actors can really beat others . In his scene he was really dominative with quality and great narrative parts . i think that Rourke still have qualities .But, I don't know why Bruce Willis and Arnold Scwarzenegger had so small appearance . OK , I can understand that they are old but I still can't understand why Willis had so frivolous narrative part . Arnold was great and after many calm roles and he gave his best and I think he improved movie quality . I heard many critics that Seagal should have appeared in this movie but I think he wouldn't find himself . Jean-Cloud Van Damme too .Effective adrenaline bomb still is missing some manners of great movies . I understand that it is not quality genre but I saw better movies . Still it is 9/10 because it surprised me with great performances and entertainment of action .",9,2,7,26 August 2010
Shutter Island," Damn good
",I was very excited about this movie because finally I could hope that it will be some good movie by Leonardo DiCaprio whose acting is pretty good. Then I saw trailer and I didn't know what is it now . I thought that maybe Scorsese will do some suspense movie like Alfred Hitchcock . I think that this mixes of thriller with one really gripping atmosphere mixed with some horror elements . I am not fond of this movies and when I saw trailer I decided that I should maybe skip watching this movie . Then I was thinking about it and I heard that it is on Top 250 so I knew that it is must watch movie and I went to watch .Whole atmosphere on the movie is quite gripping and you can feel that your impressions about this movie will be great . That is because every scene has something what is really making watcher to think about it . This is some spark which is attracting watcher . Scorsese really did something what do we can call masterpiece . Really great details and great atmosphere were so attractive and so excellent . I think that Scorsese gave his best to do this movie because I feel that this one was really special and difficult challenge for him . I think that he accepted this challenge and made his another success . He is definitely the best director because his sense for making some great attraction for watcher and he is making us to think about his movies. There are a lot of great directors(Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg)but nobody is like Scorsese .Leonardo DiCaprio made his great progress in career and he finally showed that he is entering into group of great actors . His convincing acting and definitely great discipline made his role better . He was very mature and almost every his movement was followed with great dose of convincing and serious acting . He was definitely determined to do this the best . He was definitely like whole movie because he was into this gripping atmosphere . I like his acting because he is now very good in Scorsese's movies and he can remind us on great Robert DeNiro . Both of them were always showing their sense for being into their roles and to make their character like whole atmosphere in the movie .Mark Ruffalo was very good and his maybe hard role is well acted . I don't know why I thought that he was too bad but when I saw his convincing acting and great concentration . He was very determined to do something well because when you get role from Scorsese you have to be very pleased . I think that he acted like one really famous actor . He was reminding me on some great actors . He is I think the greatest surprise in whole movie .Ben Kingsley was really great because of his serious but damn good acting . His wise sense for acting made him first-class actor . He made one great masterpiece in acting . I think that he is maybe great even for many actors who acted some similar role . I don't know how but he made something on what I can say only 'Bravo!' . Great activity in this movie and pretty great concentration on whole movie were factor why did I give 10 for this movie .That is because I like thrillers and directing and acting were great . Really good and gripping thriller which can make you thinking about it whole day . I would like to see another masterpiece by The Great Scorsese .,10,2,5,5 May 2010
Forrest Gump," The most illuminating and the best combination of comedy in drama in one movie
",There are some in which we cannot enjoy .There are some movies which aren't smart mix of comedy and drama.There is one Forrest Gump which changed whole structure of mixes .There is one Tom Hanks who definitely one of the best actor who transformed himself from dummy to smart man .There are so many laughs and so many dramatic scenes .There is one sad but funny story .There is story which learned us how one man can change the world with his running and he can call whole nation to run with him .There is one friendship with Bubba which ends with death and there is one love with Jenny .There is only one Forrest Gump and watch it .,10,4,7,8 April 2010
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Real Humor Experience
",While i was watching the movie i thought that everything could be better but everything was funny. I didn't know what to say after movie . This movie is real experience of fun . Actually movie is made for people who love real comedy . Main characters are telling us that people are sometimes babies and that they wanna be head in this world . Whole plot enters in people and you can imagine what will happen next . Director is showing how characters are very imaginative in their jobs . I can't see man who didn't enjoy in movie . I am fond of good comedies and when i compare it with other comedies i can see big difference . Movie can also illuminate you because it works like some propaganda from Middle East which is shown by masters of humor . Movie still needs something to make an impression but it has the future,8,1,1,22 February 2010
Shrek Forever After," So-so movie
",This franchise is I think maybe the most popular animated franchise after Toy Story . I think that it is really magic and entertaining franchise . I am not big lover of Shrek but thus movie always entertains me a lot . This is real animated fairytale . When I saw trailer first time I didn't even think about watching this movie . Then I decided that I should watch this sequel . I watched previous movies so why won't watch this movie ? That was my question about watching this movie . 3D as worldwide popular technique was pretty good . As movie started it seemed that it will be just as other parts but it was really special . I think this was the funniest part and most revolutionary part but it hasn't some magic like all movies . I have to say that it is much more better than boring third part . It was funny and I like that everything was greatly connected . Whole team was here . Shrek was again in center but it wasn't something like previous performances . It was pretty desperate . Fiona was finally great but it wasn't like other animated characters from this movies . Donkey again in really funny performance but Puss in Boots was unbeatable . He was so funny and he was in one new 'image' . That was the best part of the movie . Cookie wasn't so much in this movie and that was big minus . New character Rumpelstiltskin was so-so . Just as whole this movie . It wasn't like other parts of franchise but it was really entertaining .,6,1,2,24 June 2010
The Fast and the Furious," The fast and the furious
",There are so many good words for this movie and I didn't even think that I will watch it . I mean I didn't want to watch some street guys while they are challenging on the streets against the law . There were so many stupid racing scenes with this stupid shooting . Vin Diesel again in one very strong performance . His appearance was the best part of the movie but it looks that he can't improve whole movie . There are also frivolous fighting scenes with Asian gangs . Last scene with 'gripping' racing was maybe good but not so much exciting to make some real action movie . There were so many faults in making this movie but I can say that in the other hand movie is looking good . There are some scenes with some stupid sense for excitement . I am not fond of this movie because there are so many silly scenes with some street gangs .,5,2,5,22 April 2010
Tropic Thunder," Great entertainment and what else to say?
",Maybe my rating is low for my summary but this entertainment is some kind of fun but sometimes it is becoming some kind of fun which is stupid . There are many laughs but you can't laugh on some scenes . Movie is sometimes boring and it is reminding on some usual and stupid family comedies . Too many some stupid moments when Stiller is dull . He sometimes lost his power of acting . Robert Downey Jr. is good but sometimes too serious . Jack Black is very funny and his great performance really made this movie better . Every actor made his job well but sometimes they are lost in this quite slow but sometimes very fast pace . You can enjoy in every bit of it but sometimes it is boring . I am recommending but I am not sure that you will like it .,8,0,1,12 April 2010
No Country for Old Men," Great cast and great directing made one pretty gripping and high quality thriller
","There are only a few thing which made me angry about this new thrillers . There are so many bloody and stupid plots which haven't got any sense . They are made out of some sick ideas . I can tell that everything what you can see of today's thrillers are often some stupid and really needless . They are full of stupid killing without any smartness . But in 2007 we could find one really great thriller . It has also one great fact. It won an Oscar for best moving picture . I think that structure of Oscar winners is changing in every year . This is movie which is made by Coen brothers and in start it is something attracting . I wasn't some big fan of their movies because after The Big Lebowski and A Serious Man I lost every hope for some their good movie . Then I decided to watch this well rated thriller and the result is impressive thriller .When we look that this movie isn't only centered as thriller we can know that it won't be some killing . I was very surprise with this structure of whole movie . It has got great narrative parts what is well known from other Coen brothers' movies . I can see that it is made out of one strange inspiration . I don't know where did they get idea from but I am very surprised how movie is made . This is reminding me on some classic but in same time it is gripping and really great thriller . It has got something what is attracting for watcher and it is interesting watcher . I was so excited during watching this movie because it is amazingly gripping and this fighting scenes have got real spirit of thrillers . I don't know so many great thrillers . In last time I can name only Shutter Island and this movie . This whole exciting scenes are definitely world-class and with this smartness by director they really surprised me .Tommy Lee Jones was very good . This famous actor in one maybe strange role but with his uncompromising sense for acting it is nicely done . He is actor which is definitely one of top actors . His sense for entertaining and also dramatic acting is impressive . I think that he was just in pace of the movie . It is so good and sometimes I think that he was in this movie so much so he did some kind of masterpiece . Sometimes he was looking like he will do something unexpected . He made one really nice dramatic part of the movie . His acting was really good because I think that he is world-class actor and there is no hard role for him .Josh Brolin was sometimes out of pace but during this silent scenes he showed his sense for dramatic scenes . I think that he did this dramatic and thrilling scenes just as he had to do , even better . He was out during narrative part because I think that he was sometimes bad because he looked too uninterested . Looks like he just wanted to do it . It wasn't done with soul .Javier Bardem was great villain . I think that he won't act something better than this . He was silent and I was astonished with his performance . I think that he was well prepared for this role . He was great and I think that this fight scenes was just as he wanted . I know that it is hard to act some villain . This is something what I call masterpiece because so convincing acting was great to see . I think that he was great.It is great movie.",10,5,9,13 May 2010
District 9," District 9-one of the best sci-fi movie in this decade or maybe whole century
",I heard that it is damn good so I didn't want to waste time for checking when I have got time . I took my first free 110 minutes to watch it . I didn't have so much time but I enjoyed in every bit of movie . You can see that this is definitely one of the best sci-fi movies ever seen . If you like adrenaline movies this movie is must watch . There are so many excitements and intelligent tricks in this movie . Peter Jackson and Neil Blomkamp did their job properly . Maybe they made something what is the most valuable in film industry in 2009 . I liked the way how aliens are showed . Maybe it is disgusting but I wasn't afraid of it . It is very interesting how director imagined aliens . Cast hasn't got some movie stars but they did their job because of Jackson's intelligence and the way how he can assort things . For example you can see how he did it with cast on Lord of the rings . But District 9 maybe made mess in this present year and I think that this movie and Avatar were the best movies in 2009 . 2009 is year of great sci-fi movies . This is very thrilling movie and I enjoyed in every bit of it . I didn't waste my free 110 minutes on some rubbish . I wasted it on one of the best movies in 2009 .,9,1,4,5 April 2010
Batman Begins," Finally One Good Superhero Movie
",After few years of wandering finally I saw one good Batman movie . In movie you can see everything what are you expect from movie like this . You can enjoy in every moment of movie and it's really impressive how it is made . There is also my best actor Christian Bale and everything is improved with great imagination of director . I can't see anything bad in this movie . This is whole story about Batman in one movie . I really enjoyed when I saw great scenes when Batman is attacking his enemies . It is of course one of my best movies . After you watch whole movie you can see why is it great movie and why is it such praised . I really like this movie and it is shown that Batman movies can be better than they were . I am recommending it to everyone who loves action movie .,10,1,1,25 February 2010
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Rise of the summer blockbusters
","I am not going to analyse here the difference with previous Planet of the Apes movies because I think that for this movie it's important to be good no matter is it better than previous films. This movie starts from the beginning and it is on the way to become independent film. It can be suitable for every watcher. In usually boring summer cinemas are pretty emptied and Hollywood doesn't have anything special to offer. After Transformers 3 and Harry Potter you will may beg for some 'extreme' and innovative movie. Last year we had Inception and this year another intelligent SF thriller can be this one. Set in the modern world its plot is rising in some normal pace and in 100 minutes it will offer you really interesting and sometimes detailed story that will make you curious. What I like is the fact that movie doesn't impose some special style and everyone can enjoy. Sometimes it is touching,sometimes wild but it is never out of the limits. Directing was quite good and every detail is showed decently. James Franco in leading role didn't show some creative acting like in 127 Hours and Frida Pinto is pushed in the corner because of scenario that revolves mostly around apes. Maybe it seems like it is too short but I can guarantee that from very first minutes you will enjoy in show of intelligence,CGI,cast and action. Like the real movie it contains details and some centre and everything nicely set around it. You shouldn't miss this movie and you shouldn't have dilemma between this movie and some child games like Cowboys and Aliens or Harry Potter.",8,4,15,4 August 2011
2012," Effective but not enjoyable
",Director of Independence Day made more one disaster movie . On first sight it is maybe some classical adventure but it isn't . once you see it you don't want to see it next time . Great effects can really be outstanding but you can see that it is only part of movie . Movie isn't boring but you cannot enjoy in every scene . The problem in this movie is that it hasn't got soul . It is empty in some parts and you maybe won't like it because of its plot which is not connected . Movie is full of some parts which I can't stand . I know that many opinions about this movie will be very different but I cannot say it is great but I really liked visual effects . They are my best part of this movie. Reason because I wrote that it is enjoyable that it is exciting but in wrong way . Sometimes I think that it is not enjoyable to watch this movie more than 150 minutes . This is fact which is making me nervous about this movie .,6,0,0,14 March 2010
Kick-Ass," Entertaining and real superhero movie
","Superhero movies . Sounds good ? Yes,of course . This movies are really attracting and so good . I heard for this movie after I saw few times its trailer in theaters . It looked so childish . Like some teenage story which is fool of clichés and many mistakes . With whole cast I wasn't so attracted . Few unknown actors Mark Strong and Nicolas Cage which I can't stand . He is so desperate . I think that this movie was best promoted movie in Croatia in 2010 . On radio in cinemas , everywhere was Kick-Ass . So,now it is time for truth . Is it so good ? Well,pretty good . When I saw that it is on IMDb Top 250 I couldn't believe . Now I can .Matthew Vaughn as director was pretty good . His imagination mixed with illuminating elements packed in one entertaining teenage movie . You have to be master to do it . Great mix of action,comedy and drama . Sometimes it was on first sight desperate but I don't think so . Maybe this movie looks naive but it is really good . Truly superhero movie . It has got soul fun and great fight scenes . Maybe it looked ridiculous but it is well connected and mixed . I liked even soundtrack because it was good for this movie . Definitely comic book movie because it has got this specific plot . It has got great narrative parts and nice and effective action scenes . All in one great directing .Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass . Unexpected good performance . He didn't screw this movie because he showed that his appearance in this movie was very illuminating . He was serious and completely in his role . He was great and I can't even imagine that he was so good . Maybe sometimes very good and maybe sometimes very confused . If we know that he is still young we can say that he has got nice potential for all his career .Cristopher Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist was maybe bad . He looked very unconvincing and too childish . His role was I think more simply than Kick-Ass . He was bad because he didn't look like master as Johnson did . His performance was confusing and his acting screwed whole movie . He didn't look like some superhero or villain . He looked like some bad substitution .Nicolas Cage as Big Daddy was so-so . I don't like his acting but with this role of daddy he maybe showed his good side . He did something very good . He didn't look like some drunk man . He was leader in acting . His acting can be example for this young actors . He looked like real hero with soul .Mark Strong as main villain was pretty good . He has got this sense for villain . His appearance was funny because he was like Cage but in different role . He was realistic and extremely funny and brutal . I don't think that he was bad . He should be nominated for best villain . He was disciplined and he didn't look pathetic .All in one very mature and really entertaining movie .",8,1,9,24 May 2010
Gran Torino," Powerful performance by Clint Eastwood and his great directing made this movie great
",When I saw trailer for this movie I thought that this will be only some kind of thriller(then I didn't like Clint Eastwood and thrillers). I caught time for watching this movie and I was impressed . This is great and really smart movie . I didn't expect something like this but now I know why everyone told me that this is great movie . I really liked performance by Clint Eastwood and his very smart directing . There is so good performance by others . There are also humorous scenes and really calm and cool acting by Eastwood . You can see also many thrilling scenes and moments . His strong performance was so convincing . Movie is very illuminating and it has got many genres in one movie . You can really find yourself in this very good drama . Everything was on its place and every part is very well connected . I am recommending this movie and I feel that after watching this movie I am glad because I saw one great lifetime experience .,9,1,4,8 April 2010
The Hurt Locker," Well done!
","Oscar winners are always very interesting and sometimes strange . This movie is real example that Oscar winners are very good . Last year winner was Slumdog Millionaire and now this movie is maybe better because this is also social movie but made very well . Sometimes you will think that this movie is maybe worst than Avatar . I was actually supporting Avatar but day after Academy Award I watched this movie . All movie is very good and effective . Sometimes I was thinking that movie will be some classic like Saving Private Ryan or some other dramatic war movie . In every scene you can find some enjoyment . By the way it's mix of every genre in warfare . You can tell that cast is bad but they made this movie very well. I am not feeling sorry because I spent 2 hours watching it . I learned that good movie can be only made with great story,excitements and good leadership . Jeremy Renner was it . This movie is very good and you won't feel sorry if you watch it .",9,2,8,20 March 2010
Transformers," Quite entertaining
",This movie was very attracting to me and I thought that it will be some new kind of movies . Theme also was interesting . After watching this movie impressions are maybe a bit worse than expecting but movie is quite good . Some people would say that it is too much graphic and effects . I also agree but I think that behind this is very interesting story . Movie has also exciting parts which maybe disappointed me but I am glad because I watched it . Cast wasn't so impressing . Shia LeBouf is actually not my favorite actor and I don't like his performances . He was quite good and sometimes better than I expected . Megan Fox wasn't so impressing . I told this no matter on her beauty . I think that she can be also some visually good appearance . There are many other actors which were pretty solid . Everything looked quite good and whole final impression very good. Maybe better than movie really is .,7,0,4,15 April 2010
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," This movie is very strange
",Very strange movie because of its whole plot and it is unusual for animated movies . There are some moments which are very good and entertaining with very good visual effects . There are also parts when you can learn something . It is very nice but sometimes it is very weird and I don't is this kind of animated movies are unusual . Plot is a bit strangers and whole fable is sometimes very boring or better to say strange . I can find point of this movie and it is really nice . You can't find yourself such easily in this movie . It is not so good but I like it because of its funny and very inventive details and whole plot . It is very good movie for someone who is real lover of animated movies . I still can't find something very entertaining in this movie to make it better because I didn't watch this movie in 3D but I was trying to think like I watched and there are many visual excitements so I hope that many of people who watched it had fun with this visual excitements . I am recommending it but I can't that it is one of the best .,6,0,2,14 April 2010
Dumb and Dumber," Funny but.......
","...... it is great . You could enjoy in every scene . Maybe my grade is too low for this kind of critic . You can enjoy in stupid movements of Harry and Lloyd . Is it good ? Yeah, it is . Now why 7? This is maybe sometimes movie with empty soul and looks like it is centered only in humor . Everything is so funny and relaxing . Maybe because of it you can sometimes tell that it is stupid . I don't think that it is so hilarious but I liked the way how Jim Carey made this movie great . Jeff Daniels was too good but he wasn't in the same level with Jim .And is it for 7 ? Maybe I should watch it more once . So I will wait for its appearance You can see that it is must watch comedy and I am recommending it .",7,0,1,5 April 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," How much is too much?
","So, the most anticipated film of the year, the film that had to defy the pressure and had to take us by surprise after so many fan theories. And did it work?Well, 7/10 is a good rating by all means. Most of the film succeeds at bringing all the good stuff from SW universe. Judging by the visuals it is everything you like about this majestic saga. So where did it go wrong?Ever since they appeared, I haven't made my opinion on new characters and this movie didn't help that. Rey and Finn are poster girl and boy for Resistance but they seem to be too one-dimensional. None of them is that slick as Han Solo or as convincing as Luke Skywalker. But the dark side has some pretty strong aces in Kylo Ren and Supreme Leader Snoke. These two characters developed nicely and Ren's intentions are finally made clear. There is a bunch of new characters, but none of them really contribute to the plot, they are merely stand-up guys here. And what about two veterans here, Leia and Luke? Well, no need to point out they were as good as everFurthermore, there are so many plot twists and sudden changes in rhytm and I really wonder why. First third of the movie is moving along nicely, just like it's supposed to do. Second third is where this movie is losing pace and insufficiently deep scenario is a real problem here. It would have benefited from a less straightforward and more meaningful script. In the last third the movie goes full godspeed and demonstrates some stunning visuals, but as the 150 minute mark was approaching they slowed suddenly and even dragged it a bit at the end but nevertheless it was very (if not too much) eventful. Did they really have to push that many drama, theories, possibities only to go back to the seen-before route?So the movie almost turned out to be a mixed bag and yet I saw some stunning moments,never seen before in this saga. The movie had a lot of boxes to tick and a lot of feel good atmosfere to create and it does that decently. But in the end what looked like to be a definitive Star Wars movie for generations to come is really a lot of everything that still ends up short of being constant and majestic as some previous installments were.",7,1,17,13 December 2017
Clash of the Titans," Nice but sometimes stupid
","I couldn't believe when I heard for bad critics for this movie . If I could see well this movie was one of the most expecting movie in 2010 . Trailer was very good and I didn't know how it is so bad . Of course I am fond of this kind of movies . At first sight it was reminding me on some 3D movie which can compare to Avatar in gross but I think that it isn't . I heard that this movie is converted from 2D to 3D so I didn't expect so much but I wanted to watch it .This movie has got its narrative part which is well made . I think that Louis Letterier made this job maybe too weakly . His fighting scenes weren't so understanding because they were jumbled . I don't know why so bad but when I saw his great imagination my opinion about this movie grew up . I think that maybe this story could be much more better . Sometimes too many childish effects but sometimes great and really effective fights . 3D as one 'new' discovery gained its top when Avatar was in theaters but I think that this movie wasn't maybe the best choice for 3D . I think that this movie is full of some not such nice parts and I think that Letterier's imagination is mixing good and bad sides so it looks like some average mix .Sam Worthington as Perseus was very good . His sense for acting is again showed . He is maybe the best part because his convincing acting is so powerful that I can't believe . I didn't know why is he maybe sometimes too arrogant but he is great in role of mythological story . I think that he was just perfect for this role but sometimes he was bad and sometimes he was good . He was maybe too aloof but he found himself in fighting scenes . He is simply good but his job was difficult .Ralph Fiennes as Hades was maybe good but maybe he had his downs . It is very difficult when you have to act someone like Hades . It was too difficult and it looks like he was fed up of this role . Whole cast sometimes looked too relaxed . He wasn't good in all his appearance so he reminded me on some characters from childish fantasy . I think that his role maybe was too childish because I think that Hades should be showed on more serious way . I still don't know why was he maybe bad but I think that director could make his role more seriously .Liam Neeson as Zeus was damn good . His great voice and great sense for acting very difficult roles in many movies is impressing . I think that he made something what can be called great work . Result of everything great showing of Zeus . He had never showed some faults during the movie . His role is in same level as many his good roles . I think that he made this movie better . His good side was when he was showing all his power of his acting . His legendary 'Release the Kraken!' should enter in group of legendary sentences in movie history .Gemma Arterton in one effective role of Io was so good . Her role wasn't in original Clash of the Titans but I think that this movement wasn't useless . Of course , it made this movie better because her appearance was so good that I couldn't realize that he is really good . Her narrative role was perfect and I think that maybe her magical acting . She maybe gained the top of her career . Her voice really made this narrative parts better . I think that this was right movement by director .This effective disappointed me in some stage but I am attracted with great effects like fights with Gorgona Medusa or big scorpions . I don't like maybe too short but very effective and thrilling fight with Kraken . I am fond of this movie but I am still angry because it could be better . Much more better .",7,1,1,6 May 2010
The Dark Knight," Great superhero movie
",I didn't believe when I heard for it.I wasn't some big lover of Batman when this movie came to theaters but when I read the critics I couldn't believe . This movie is really attracting . I became big lover of Batman because this movies have got something what others don't have . This is great story and exciting scenes . I didn't like so much directing by Tim Burton(actually Batman Returns)because it is imaginative but sometimes too childish . Directing by Joel Schumacher wasn't even good . It was terrible because this movie were so stupid and they weren't Batman movies . That was some Batchild . Cristopher Nolan is great because he really gotta sense for this movies . His plot and whole great action scenes .Dark Knight has got many great action scenes so everything was great and well connected parts are so good . Every actor made his job like real master . I am still in impressions of this movie .Christian Bale was really great because his serious acting . I like him because he knows how to enter in character's skin . His convincing acting is really impressive . Great Batman role is something what you can't get every day so looks like he was really glad because of his roles . His calm acting and whole great behavior during the movie is really impressive . I am fond of this masked superhero and I don't want when someone screws this role and he didn't .Heath Ledger as Joker was really brutal . I don't like his performance so much like Jack Nicholson's . He wasn't very good at acting of crazy villain . He wasn't so relaxed but his calm sense for crazy acting was great . He nicely combined brutal movements and serious movements with sometimes great Joker's sense for humor . I am fond of great villains and Ledger acted it on one modern and totally catchy way .Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face was so good but sometimes he had failures in acting . I can still find sometimes his stupid acting but when I find his really brutally good acting of one villain I know that he is very good . His really strange sense for action and really he didn't show any signs of stupid and forced acting . I mean he didn't go crazy during this movie like some actors know to do .Other actors and actress were good like Gary Oldman who acted pretty well . When you see how convincing he was you can see that he is good . Morgan Freeman was very relaxed but he can't act badly . I don't know . He is simply perfect actor . Maggie Gyllenhaal was very good because of her nice and really stylish acting . Her appearance was really surprising . Director made really great work so he made one great and absolutely Top 10 movie . Really great!,10,4,9,4 May 2010
Blood Diamond," Very good movie
",I have never heard for this movie all until it wasn't on TV . I am not fond of some dramas with social theme because they are too bad but this movie is something you must see . When I saw recommendation in newspapers I decided to watch it . I like acting by Leonardo DiCaprio because he is actor with great character . You can't be aloof after watching this movie because it is very good . Great action scenes and really sentimental moments are something what is making this movie better . There are very well used techniques of drama movies . This is not some new invention but it is really masterpiece . I don't like only few scenes with this journalist and sometimes Leo DiCaprio is too frivolous . I like his acting because he decently showed this situation . Maybe sometimes this movie will look frivolous but I don't mind it .,8,0,0,3 June 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Visual and acting masterpiece . Movie has got the potential
",I watched this movie only 3 days after world premiere in Croatian cinema. I think that about this movie you can write another book . I haven't got anything against this movie . It is excellent but when you see the book you think that it could be better.Tim Burton got the idea for making movie about one of the most favorite fairy tale in childhood . Tim Burton is not missing ideas and every his movie is expected as some explosion of great Hollywood imagination . He is famous and everyone likes to cooperate with him and his reputation cannot be bad because one movie . Great directed movie . Burton is still one of the best directors when you ask for imagination . He had so big spectra for experimenting . He is making so convincing movies and so imaginative that you cannot believe your eyes when you see it . Burton set everything on its place . He is genius and he has got sense for leadership .Visual effects and 3D technology didn't disappoint . You are having experience for whole your eyes . It's visual holiday and you can't be calm when you are talking about visual part of this movie . Scenes are really beautiful and you would like to enter in this wonderland . So beautiful and magic aspects that you cannot believe . It is so connected . Visual masterpiece made by Disney is guaranteed so you shouldn't worry about visual enjoyment . Now it is coming harder part .Story and its realization . Maybe there is something wrong . Lewis Carolls story is very complicated . This is the only part when Burtons directing is bad . Whole book and its storyline isn't very well moved on movies plot . Maybe movie is like cut of whole storyline . This is the only defect of this masterpiece . But when you see what is coming next you can say that it is better than its ratings . This movie is really good realized but storyline is maybe not well transferred .Now cast . Mia Wasikowska as Alice was really first class . Impressing acting . Mia showed very great talent for her promising future . She was really mature in this acting . Pretty impressing . Maybe she looked confused but this is real Alice . Mia is now compared with some famous actress but she has big dose of maturity . She was really impressing ans you cannot change this fact .Johnny Depp as Mad Hatter was very funny and cool . He showed that his entertaining abilities and I really liked him in this movie . He was really in this plot and he showed great spectra of acting . I really appreciate him as actor . You don't know how far can his entertainment be . I really couldn't understand why he appears in child movie but now I know . He is so good and one of my favorite actor . He made this movie better .Helene Bonham Carter as Red Queen was maybe the worst part but she was negative character but she was so funny . maybe too loud but this is fairy tale and you have to have some negative character . She showed that she found herself in this movie . Maybe she looked ridiculous but you know everyone looked changed in their face . Another stupid and frivolous acting ? Definitely not . I don't like movies like this but everything attracted me .Anne Hathaway as White Queen was so creative and she was magic . I read interview with her after premiere of this movie she said that she concentrated and that she entered into her role . She was totally in . She was so elegant and so kind and she showed that she is not only actress . She is actress with powerful acting . I really liked her role. Maybe she was too good and magic to believe .Others were really good . Stayne was very awesome and he was actually pretty good interpretation . White Rabbit and Cheshire Cat were magic and funny . They were really good . Tweedledee and Tweedledum were also funny and entertaining .After all this is great interpretation of fairy tale . Magic and good . Maybe it is missing better transferring of the storyline . Magic and fantastic adventure and real masterpiece .,8,1,5,24 March 2010
Avatar," Excellent ,masterpiece ,illuminative , superb and the greatest movie of the year
",James Cameroon after Titanic again set one young and not well known acting pair . He again showed that his knowledge and sense for talents are victorious combination . I saw trailer and I thought that it is some meaningless science fiction movie which is only taking money for its effects . Then I decided to watch it . After few moments you understand that it is lifetime story .Actors and actresses showed very mature performance and it was really enjoyable to watch 'em . They entered in their role and there are so many enjoyable and effective moments so you can count o it .Visual perfection in 3D is guaranteed . This is movie isn't some machine which is taking money from cinemas . This movie is definitely the best movie in 2009 and I am recommending it to everyone .,10,3,6,27 March 2010
Invictus," Really good drama
",When I first time heard for this movie I was astonished . I didn't see something like this so I expected good movie . Theme is really attracting and I saw ratings and I decided to wait for its cinema release . Movie was released in December but in Croatia it was in March so I decide to wait it on DVD . I would feel stupid if I watch something what will be released for two months . There are few interesting facts like its Oscar nominations . Great two leading roles were really good fact . Trailer didn't show much things but then I got it o DVD . This isn't wasting time and I was really astonished how movie is good .Clint Eastwood as director was world class . Maybe this movie isn't in level of his masterpieces like Gran Torino but it is really good . This isn't some dramatic movie but it is in spirit of whole atmosphere . I can't see anything extremely bad about this movie . Eastwood is one of the best directors and actors and now he confirmed his sense for directing . I can see that he made one drama with nice atmosphere soul and complicated situations . This isn't some movie which can beat some dramas because of its sometimes too idyllic moments . It is really good drama and it is easily winning watcher's heart .Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela was really excellent . You can see how his experience is bringing quality to this movie . His great acting is again confirmed with one really conclusive acting mixed with his great narrative parts . There weren't any special mistakes so his acting was great . He definitely was brilliant with his strong performance and his physically similar look with Mandela . This movie is really nicely showing problems and happiness so Freeman was on level .Matt Damon as Francois Pienaar wasn't so good as Freeman but also very conclusive acting . He was maybe too unhappy during movie but he showed great spirit . I think he was also great choice for this role . His appearance was maybe great showing of his character acting . He really has a sense for acting so we could see it in this movie . I think he is one of the best younger actors . He didn't show some mistakes so it was really good .All in one really good drama . I am definitely recommending this movie.,9,1,2,4 June 2010
Up," Lifetime experience
",I watched this movie month ago and I heard that it is predicted for the best cartoon in 2009 . It won and I am glad because of it because I think that there is no movie which can be better from this . I can't understand that someone can tell that cartoons haven't got a point . This cartoon is real example that cartoons have got the point . When you see it once you know why it is so good . The greatest fact of movie is that it is so illuminating and because this you will like it . Maybe someone will say that it is too serious but finally I saw some cartoon which is about real life . You can think that it is great but it is more than this . Plot is connecting impossible adventure with different people and their opinions . It is very emotional and it is real picture of our life and our environment .,9,0,1,14 March 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," Excellent!!!
",There aren't so many cartoons in which I enjoy and I didn't have some special wish to go watching this movie . Maybe I was so impressed with this 3D technology that my wish was stronger than me . I saw the trailer and I thought that it is something new . This movie took theme which is maybe never took in animated movies . I don't know what happened to authors of Madagascar and Shrek but I realized that this movie is great. With this trailer I thought that my wish for animated movies passed because I used to watch animated movies few years ago . There was only one thing which attracted me . Critics . There were excellent that I couldn't believe . I thought that everything is maybe some great mistake . But it isn't . The only which was bad was Croatian synchronization . Our synchronization is usually bad . I decided to go and check what is this . At first sight this movie was humorous but like others . I was excited about this movie and I think that I am now fond of this movie . Everything was brilliant and 3D technology was perfect . Whole plot was very well connected and every part made this movie excellent . I haven't any minus for this movie . Becoming characters and visual masterpiece . This dragons really made me happy . No matter what theme was maybe unusual authors definitely made something superb . There were so many great parts like Night Fury-smart and becoming dragon . This whole movie maybe isn't so illuminating but it is showing us something what others aren't . This movie really gotta soul . I liked many parts but the most part when Night Fury started to laugh and his becoming face and part when Hiccup is training him . Stoick was also great . Astrid was good . Even Croatian synchronization was good I am disappointed that I couldn't hear Jay Baruchel and Gerard Butler . Maybe ending is sad when Hiccup finished without feet but I liked this all visual thrills . This movie is really great and I like it .,10,1,3,26 April 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Big disappointment
",When I decided to watch this movie I thought that it will be something very good because I even heard that it is better than first . But I support people who told that it is worse than first one . I think that it can be title 'How to screw good serial?' . I don't know even why is Steven Spielberg involved in this terrible movie . Is there anything interesting? No . There are so many stupid parts . I don't know why I am writing critic for this movie . I can tell you that it is something what I can call 'How computerized movie can make some movies worse than they really are ?' . There are so many effects which are awful . In first time there were also many effects but they were better showed . Shia LeBouf is again making this movie bad . His acting was totally stupid and it wasn't enjoyable to watch his 'brave' acting . Megan Fox had the best appearance. But only because of her beauty . Acting ? Stupid . This whole movie is based on some story which can't even entertain little child . There are stupid and awful details . Only sometimes thrilling fights but even in this stage movie screwed . I am definitely not fond of this movie and I am not recommending it .,3,1,6,21 April 2010
Crazy Heart," Pretty good and well made drama
",There aren't so many good movies in last time . Looks like old traditions are forgotten and there is coming some new trick with big budget and low performance . In this time we can't watch anymore some good drama and there are so many too bloody horrors and thrillers . Everything is changing but there are some new movies which respect old values . This movie was very well rated and I heard only good things about it . You can watch this movie whenever you want because you can enjoy and always learn something new from this good drama . There aren't some faults because whole cast was disciplined .Jeff Bridges was as usual very good . He always has some hard roles but he can act it . I think that it is pretty hard to act some drunk country singer . There are always some parts he has to act some hard moments but he was so realistic . You can learn lot from his role . This movie is quite illuminating and I really like it . I sometimes think that he wasn't the best in moments when he has to act in some romantic scenes but Jeff is old school actor and I really like his acting .Other things maybe weren't so good . Robert Duvall and Collin Farrel weren't so much in this movie but I think that Farrel was just like his role . With his long hair like real musician . I don't like the ending because it was maybe so fast and unconvincing and I think that Bridges's concentration fell down . I didn't like romantic parts when journalist had interview and they started kissing . It is definitely good movie which has the old values .,7,3,5,23 April 2010
Wedding Crashers," Why did I watch this stupid romantic comedy?
",I made terrible fault today . I watched this movie . Actually I even insisted for watching this movie . I heard that it is very funny . Hilarious . I am not agreeing with this compliments . I tried to laugh on 'funny' scenes . There are many jokes which are already out . I still can't understand how this actors can behave . I have respect for Cristopher Walken but he was completely boring and frivolous . There are maybe some forced scenes but heart of this movie is empty . Some stupid plot with bad acting . They even tried to make success with beautiful girls . Maybe here they even made faults . Vince Vaughn should ask himself about his acting . I don't like his foolish sense for humor . I don't like his performance from Couples Retreat . I can't believe how this movie is so bad . It is too overrated . I am also 'impressed' with performance by Owen Wilson . He was so childish . I am definitely not recommending this movie .,2,1,2,2 May 2010
Inception," Movie of century and definitely summer must watch movie
","After many great work by Nolan I expected Inception . After watching trailer I have never thought that so strange movie can make so big achievement . In this century there are many movies which were good but I think there is no stranger and better movie all until this . I think that this year is great and full of quality movies and two of them broke into Top 10 of all time(Inception and Toy Story 3). This movie is so specific . It is placed after Godfather which made new kind of directing and this is also great . This is modern movie and made so great that after few year people will talk about it . Nolan made the future and I think that many great directors can hide behind him . After great Avatar I think that it defeated many great century movies .Nolan as director after great achievement with Dark Knight showed his best . Direction was really great and he took care for every detail and made 140 minutes of great job for your mind . It was his home-run and he defeated every his hater . Script,direction,scenes and effects . Everything was so great . Many people hate him because he is upcoming director and most of his movies have enormous budgets but it isn't so important . This summer Nolan will pull everyone in cinema .Cast was great and Leo DiCaprio really had another Oscar worthy acting . With emotive parts and really big efforts he showed that he isn't so little kid from Titanic . 2010 is his year because after great Shutter Island we got sci-fi movie for decades . Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy were great and they made completely great rest of cast with their mature performances . And for completely great cast female part did their job on great way . Ellen Page and Marion Cotillard were very good in their roles .So this summer there is no better thing then watch this movie . It conquered year and decade . In 2100 we will see,maybe century .",10,1,5,1 August 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Cool Middle-Age Detective
",Famous British detective from Baker Street got one nice part in new Ritchie's movie . With great sense for action Sherlock is sending us message that he is in action whole his life . it seems that this is one of the best blockbusters in great 2009 . Movie hasn't boring parts and I really like it because main characters (Holmes and Watson) are showing their great art of beating criminals . Robert Downey Jr. made it great and Sherlock was so cool in his role . I can see that everyone is really surprised with making this movie . It is full of intelligent scenes and tricks . I am also impressed with Watson who was loyal to Holmes . I want to say that this movie really has potential to be successful because it was really good and I think that everyone who loves action will like it.,9,0,1,27 February 2010
Despicable Me," Gru,Dr.Nefario and Minions.....expect many laughs
","Steve Carrel known as funny actor always knew how to make us laugh . After Ice Age same producers are also in this project . There are no many movies similar to this because of many things . This movie contains everything . Sometimes it can't remind me on any movies . Gru as main protagonist was very difficult character and whole movie is discovering many new things about him . It is magic how he became from villain to great father . In this a bit strange theme there were many laughs,sometimes toughing moments . Dr.Nefario was also great . Sometimes he was looking like villain but through whole movie he was just good old man dedicated to his project . It was hilarious how he made different machines for Gru . Minions were the funniest part of the movie and I really liked them . Sometimes they have hilarious arguing and many times they can really make you to say 'Oh,how sweet!'.There are really many laughs in this movie and I think it is the best combination so far . So,for every boring moment in summer we can really be happy because of so funny movies .",8,1,2,3 August 2010
X-Men: First Class," X-Men First Class Movie
","Precisely on the half of year 2011 while many watchers expected a miracle to happen and to see some stunning movie it didn't happen a miracle.Just in the cinemas there appeared new X-Men movie.If the trilogy didn't bring you real sense of superhero story then 2009 was your year.X-Men franchise went in time before mutants' larger existence on the Earth.Wolwerine was refreshing prequel and finally some really good-structure superhero film.Now after 6 months of drought in cinemas,after 6 months of dull movies and still not enough good movies First Class arrived in the cinema.At first sight you have a story about Proffesor X and Magneto.These two characters aren't maybe so interesting as Wolverine but their fight has really nice backup.Matthew Vaughn as a director of overall teenage movie Kick-Ass in my view wasn't taken seriously.He showed that he is really shrewd and gifted.He didn't let the movie to have its ups and downns.It was constantly great and you could really be finally interested in something in cinema for about 2 hours.Michael Fassbender was kind of dark horse in his appearance but he was really surprising.McAvoy showed that Wanted isn't peak of his career.Even the appearance of the lady from Mad Men,January Jones surprised me.Her fatal appearance provided enough material for good story.Kevin Bacon in role of dirty villain concluded a really great potential of cast.The youngsters from the movie were surprisingly goood and they didn't spoil the movie.And finally my favourite 5 seconds were short appearance of Wolverine.And now after great effects you can conclude that finally we got complete movie.Who knows will the rest of the year overcome this state of art.",10,1,3,25 June 2011
Iron Man," Great and really impressive superhero movie
",When you see Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark you see that he is wright man for this role . I enjoyed in every moment of this great movie based on famous comic . Scenes are very good and imagination of director is on every scene used on good way . You cannot say that it is bad movie . This is one of the best superhero movie ever seen . Everything was on its place and result of everything was impressive performance . I liked acting of Downey Jr. because he is cool actor and this is one of his best acting . Jeff Bridges also was very good and he showed which kind of actor is he . It is so good that I can't still believe that it is so good. I am impressed with every character and whole acting . I am recommending it because it is great adaption of famous comic .,9,0,2,29 March 2010
Toy Story 3," Great sequel
",When you watch animated movies you are really starting to like them . That was my case.I like Toy Story franchise so this movie really make me to laugh on some moments . Smartly dosed humor is really powerful formula for good cartoon . Pixar in cooperation with Disney really made another great movie . I like their movies because they have some dramatic and touching moments mixed with humor . After really great movies from franchise this one was again complicated and what is more important it is following formula of previous successes . All toys are here and some new which really completed good story . Woody and Buzz are again leaders of great entertainment . 3D is really great invention for animated movies because it is making better experience . It attracted watchers . I think this movie entertaining masterpiece and real example of great cartoons .,10,1,1,17 July 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," The best the funniest part of this serial
",Dawn of the Dinosaurs is definitely the best part of whole serial . After Meltdown it is again coming with good inspiration . This is the funniest part of this serial . There are so many funny parts and there are many new characters and many new movements . It is funny how they were rescuing themselves from dinosaurs . Sid again was the funniest part and it is funny how he wanted to take care about dinosaurs . You really can enjoy in every bit of it . I liked the ending when baby dinosaurs learned some movements from Sid . You can still like this movie because it is very imaginative . Dinosaurs were very dangerous but I liked how things transformed . I liked whole imagination and this is the funniest parts . You can say how it is same but in some ways it is again bringing us new vision of this serial . I hope that this movie will be followed by some imaginative and funny part .,8,1,2,8 April 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Justifies the hype and awakens the Force that franchise lost in prequel trilogy
","There are very few people who won't admit this is the most anticipated movie of this decade. Taking all those expectations into account reviewing this title is quite a difficult and delicate thing but after seeing this movie on its release day it is impossible to hide all these positive emotions. Every fan will rediscover his inner child and get goosebumps at almost every reference to the galaxy far away.J.J. Abrams is one of the most acclaimed directors of his generation and putting him at the helm of this project was undoubtedly right decision. The way he handles this ultra-heavyweight burden of expectations and historical importance is just jaw-dropping. Throughout 135 minutes of the movie your mind travels through flurry of his impeccably executed ideas. Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it still feels fresh despite (expectedly,I must admit) putting so many references to the previous installments. Those references are also the reason I didn't give 10 stars. Sometimes you get the feeling that it is all about refreshing all the stuff from 70s and 80s. Most likely that is the result of big corporation (Disney) standing behind high grossing project as Star Wars really are. But don't worry about that too soon because flaws are easily overshadowed by a decent plot and cinematography at its very highest.Cast consists of both rising stars and franchise veterans. And this combination never fails to amaze because the chemistry between characters is just like in the old days of Star Wars when Harrison Ford and co. were not that famous. Boyega and Ridley give their best and really live for this movie and their ambition about this project is almost palpable. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) may feel like Darth Vader 2.0 but he is somehow more intriguing. Queen Leia and Han Solo are just as good as ever and having them back here is a real joy. Luke,well his story is more of a mystery,that's all I can say.Whatever your attitude towards this one is,if you ever liked any of the six previous parts you should go for this one. Despite sometimes feeling a bit too familiar and serial it is more than welcome arrival in this franchise. Whole crew just put their hearts into this one and created a magnetic atmosphere that really makes this one of the most enjoyable movies of 2010s so far. I wouldn't dare to say it is the best of 2015 but it is definitely up there among the best.",9,53,118,16 December 2015
Deadpool," Simply enjoy this movie for what it is. And it is a gamechanger
","After months of all kinds of trailers, posters and tireless social media promotion, Deadpool is finally in the cinemas. To be completely honest it is everything it promises to be. What was obvious at a first glance is that this movie is different from usual superhero stuff we see almost every month. in fact,this movie should not be called a superhero movie,nor antihero movie. Why so? Deadpool (aka Wade Wilson),famously proclaimed as the Merc With The Mouth, is actually a really cool guy in a red suit. His role is not saving the world (or city) from an alien threat. He is a man on a mission but one that is more about himself than benefiting society. But as we all know it his most noticeable feature is his wit and there are tons of that throughout 105 minutes.Giving 9/10 is giving this movie a considerable weight and I was inclined to give it 8. Why didn't I? Because I simply enjoyed the movie,had many laughs and loved action scenes (which were kinda pretentious and over-pumped,but who really cares). As far as I am concerned that is mission accomplished.This movie definitely could have had more use of its plot. It is decent at its best and comparable to many other Marvel movies. As you can now guess the villain (played by Ed Skrein) is not that interesting and magnetic and gets completely overshadowed by somewhat egoistic main character. Those are some serious drawbacks but they are sacrificed for the best thing about this movie. It is bringing freshness to a bit mundane superhero world. Now,you don't really watch what he is doing next but how he is doing it. For once you get not only to love a titular character but you are ready to let him entertain you for an hour and a half.So is this is just an action comedy? You can put it that way,but it is difficult to really define it. This movie simply exists in its own universe,and it does it so effortlessly. And it deserves a massive applause for that",9,7,21,12 February 2016
Slumdog Millionaire," Nice but dramatic and jumbled
","When I heard for this movie I was impressed and I couldn't wait . Movie about quiz was really interesting theme but what went wrong ? Movie was totally exciting but you have to know when it should be used . All the movie was jumbled , sometimes out of pace . Indian story was really nice but social scenes didn't improve quality of movie .Was there anything interesting ? Yes it was . Quiz excitements but there are some parts which are impossible and foolish . This was part when leader of the quiz in pause wrote on the mirror wrong answer for the last question . This is impossible .I appreciate the movie only because it was lifetime story when you watch you'll never forget it . Believe me . I am recommending it but I don't like this movie because I don't like social and unprofessional movies .",5,0,1,24 March 2010
Valkyrie," History should be maybe better showed
",Valkyrie is one historical movie which is bringing us some parts of Second World War. After beginning movie is going up in its plot but maybe there are some parts which are maybe lost in imagination . This is great war drama but I think that it could be better. There are some very convincing and gripping moments but sometimes boring dialogues . Maybe there are too many parts which are standing in time . I liked the way how things are presented but there are some modern parts . It is maybe because of Bryan Singer which are reminding me on some parodies . Tom Cruise had very strong performance and that's why I liked whole movie . Maybe he sometimes looked confused but whole movie he had great leading role . I like this movie so much but there are too bad things because of may rating is 7 . Nice movie .,7,0,0,3 April 2010
The Simpsons Movie," Great entertainment for everyone
",After watching serials about Simpsons it was big surprise to hear about the movie . I wasn't so interested in this movie at first because of Croatian terrible synchronization . Then I got it on DVD . It was nice to see this movie because it followed serials and there were a lot of fun as we could expect . Every character was showed as he really was . It is so realistic and I think that it also has its point . I enjoyed in every scene because this is big surprise . It is great movie and I think that everybody should see it . Everything in this movie was perfect so I suggest you to watch it . Maybe it isn't a big fun as serial but it is great how movie is showed . I am definitely recommending this movie to everybody who haven't already watched it . This is great showing of serial on big screen .,9,1,1,1 May 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," Genius thriller
",How it can be bad movie ? Sometimes I was thinking about quality of movie and I understood that it is brilliant and genius thriller . It is so gripping and all scenes are well connected . Movie has got everything what can name it great thriller . I don't know how is it so bad rated . Movie is so good and it is really enjoyable and it is maybe too god for this ratings . There is more one thing which I liked in this movie . This is great leading roles .Jaime Foxx was really convincing in his acting . I think that it isn't flattering that you are acting some corrupted lawyer . In some parts he is very good at using his spectra of acting but sometimes he is calm and he is doing his job very well . Only thing I didn't like how movie turned him into positive character . Many of them didn't like ending when lawyer is finding weapon cache and when he solved his enemy .Gerard Butler was also really convincing and I was impressed with his transformation from 'daddy' to killer . He was so good that I can't still believe . His role was very hard but he did it superbly . His character Clyde was intelligent and very smart killer . It was so smart how he revenged to killers of his family . He was very good and he knew how it was hard but he did it .It is one of the best and the smartest movie I have ever seen .,10,1,4,30 March 2010
Up in the Air," Not that entertaining.
",I watched the movie and it has many boring dialogs but i can see that movie is made very professionally and it is some mix of romance and humor.Movie will maybe get some Academy award but i doubt that it will get for the best movie because Avatar is the favorite.So i think that it is only for people who love romance.George is still not prepared for some great romantic comedy.Movie is full of unprofessional humor and it is still too frivolous for real fans of good comedy. I still cannot see some good reasons for good ratings.It is not for recommendation and me and my company almost slept in cinema.The problem is that you cannot concentrate on movie. We will see how it works on Academy awards. I saw better romantic comedies.,5,1,3,20 February 2010
V for Vendetta," V for very good movie
",I watched this movie because I heard good critics about it. I was actually impressed with whole movie . Maybe in some parts movie is going down in plot but sometimes action is bringing us nicely done movie . It is quite good but sometimes it is disappointing me because of sentimental parts . Movie is very intelligent story and you will surprise how it can be so good . This is really damn good movie and it is something what you cannot forget so easily . Adventure and story about revolution will make you better . This movie has got heart and it is so nice and so entertaining for its type .Natalie Portman maybe disappointed me but she was really in her role and that is one important thing . Maybe she was looking confused but she had very hard role . She had to act some girl who is not abiding the law of new totalitarian Britain . She was maybe convincing but sometimes too dramatic . She didn't know what to do . She was maybe so confused but in the end of movie she looked very strong . She looked like she got some new experience . There are maybe some boring parts but I think that story is very illuminating .Hugo Weaving as V was the best part of the movie . Maybe his role was pretty convincing but the best was how he did his job . His idol Guy Fawkes didn't do it but he did it . His fighting scenes were damn good. His voice and way how he was speaking are impressive . He was unbeatable and that was the best . There are some parts when he is illuminating but better parts are when he is solving whole system . He is learning us how freedom can be very expensive . I liked his mask and the way how he is kidding with system . His mask was funny because this smile was damn good . Very good movie,9,2,8,2 April 2010
