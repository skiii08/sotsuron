The Blair Witch Project," I blame my friends for seeing this crap
","Come On! This was ridiculous. The only thing i'll give it is that it shocked people by not being a 'movie' but a fake documentary. Ohhhhh, that is scary! I blame my friends for making up the fact that it was real before we saw it---Alot of that BS was going around in Ohio and it made people pay to see it!!!! What the heck!!! Oh i was mad--it gave me a headache watching it, and a couple of high school seniors could've done better. Nowadays we are so compelled to like something totally ridiculous because it is 'different' This film needs to be burnt at the stake like a witch.",Null,0,0,27 February 2000
Memento," A movie with some pizazz!
","Its about time people that make movies actually got a clue. All these 'great' directors, and most of them suck. There is one facet of movie making that prevents them from being quality. That facet is called money. Film makers make movies to bring in revenue, so they can buy a house in Cali, buy a lot of Cocaine and percocets, and have sex with beautiful women. The typical hollywood cat. I don't care how good an actor is, if the movie sucks, it sucks. bottom line. So heres the deal, once in a great while a director comes along and says I am going to CREATE a movie that is intriguing, mysterious, and very mind-engaging to view. Noyce (director) did this with Memento. This movie is astoundingly good. The characters are all screwed up, and very human. Carrie-ann Moss (chick from Matrix) is in it and actually plays the role of a true female human, a bitch. This is great. If you have not seen this movie then go and see it. It is definately worth the money. You will NEED to see it again. I did.",10,0,1,10 October 2001
Braveheart," It made me think...I well die but have I really Lived?
","'Your heart is free, have the courage to follow it' Wallaces Father.  This is the only movie i have ever watched that has enlightened and endowed me with something. Mel Gibson is absolutely unbelievable in his unrelenting quest for freedom, however he is just not simply fighting for freedom from bondage to England, but freedom from the oppression within his lands. He is trying to unite the heart of Scotland within itself to stand up to its outside oppressors. This movie is an enigma in filmmaking. How often do you see hollywood make a movie that holds up true value and tru love in the quest for life. i have seen the movie at least 20 times. It also depicts Wallace as a holy man driven with determination, enveloped with loyalty to his countrymen, himself, his country, and his God. If you have seen it and admire it then you will remember when Wallace was in the jail awaiting his torture and he prayed to God to give him the strength to do the right thing after he could've took the poison. Because he knew that taking the poison would only bend his will and give him weakness in the greatest test of his beliefs, and if he couldn't stand for his beliefs fullt sober and aware then how could he ever believe in what he had done. I think this is the greatest film of all time- not just for the story-not just for the direction and the strength that it has-or the effort and attude Gibson and the rest of the film crew put into it, but for the wholesomeness it brought up in me- it made me think of who i am and what i believe and what i will stand up for. and more importantly if i have that courage to embark on my belief. a masterpiece, a milestone for hollywood. Mel Gibson desrves so much credit for this film. The best film ever made by a long shot. Ryan",10,2,3,17 September 1999
