It," Great Scenes in Search of a Story
","It's difficult to make a great adaption of Stephen King's novels. Mostly because what's on the page can often come across as silly on the big screen. IT is one of the better adaptions. The acting is fantastic. They perfectly cast the child actors. Pennywise is truly terrifying, as portrayed here. Taken scene by scene, there is little to fault. However, IMO, there isn't much of a story. I struggled to find a connective tissue from beginning to end. Definitely worth a watch, but from a storytelling standpoint, it's just okay.",6,0,0,9 April 2020
Captain Marvel," Captain Un-Marvelous
","The trailers for this movie had me worried it would be bad. It was. The only reason I paid money to see it was I wrongly believed it was part of a set-up for End Game. Turns out, that was not the case.
There is very little to recommend here. If it wasn't for the cat, I would give it only one star. Even the special effects are average.",3,7,16,8 October 2019
Us," Very Disappointing
","It's hard to review this movie without giving away the plot. But this is a spoiler-free review. There are numerous surprises in the story, so if you plan to watch it, I don't want to ruin it for you. Let me just say that the movie has major plot holes. It also relies heavily on exposition. When your characters have to give epic speeches to explain what's going on, that means you have a very poor script. A story should tell itself, through what the viewer hears, sees, and interprets. You shouldn't have to spell it all out. What's between the lines and between the scenes is just as important.
The story becomes so convoluted it would have been better to leave it all a mystery. But, when the movie ends, and you go back and try to think of what could have been done to salvage it, you realize that it is just a very bad script. The actors do what they can with the material they have. I'm just shocked that nobody read this and said, 'none of this makes sense.'
Critics that have praised this movie have said there are many meanings that can be interpreted, or that it will be debated for years. No. Not at all. The final act of the movie comes up with a laughable explanation for the story's events. It creates more questions than it desperately tries to answer. There is no deep philosophical set of metaphors happening here - just a bad movie with a high production value.
Watch at your own risk. Just be prepared to be let down.",1,1,4,3 December 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A Political Thriller and Superhero Movie Rolled Into One
","I enjoyed the first Captain America, but I wasn't ready for how truly brilliant this sequel would be. IMO this movie ranks as one of the greatest Marvel movies. It's definitely in the top three and may be my number one. It all comes down to the script.
Unlike most superhero flicks, the story does not involve chasing and stopping a shiny object in order to save the earth. Instead, we have a tightly written political thriller. This could have easily been a Tom Clancy novel that had Captain America written into it. The story has many brilliant twists. The action scenes are spectacular. The visual effects are close to perfect. You name it, and the movie nails it - acting, directing, music. Chris Evans is at his best in the lead role.
The movie also stands up to repeat viewings, which can be a rarity when they have some surprising twists. Even when you know what's coming, it's still a fantastic movie.",10,1,3,8 October 2019
Man of Steel," Henry Cavill IS Superman
","I don't get the negative critical reviews for this movie. Yes, the tone is dark and brooding. It's merely a different take on the Superman character. I don't feel Zack Snyder is going all 'Dark Knight' on us with this version. His vision of Krypton and Clark growing up on earth is fantastic. I also love how the story is told through flashbacks instead of a linear timeline.
The special effects are fantastic, and I think the score is one of my favorite superhero scores of all time.
The movie is perfectly cast. Henry Cavill is the first actor, IMO, that looks like he stepped off the pages of a comic book. He, along with Chris Hemsworth, look like they were made for their roles.
I've seen this movie a dozen times and it never gets old.",9,2,2,8 October 2019
Super 8," A Sci-Fi Goonies
","The child actors are fantastic in Super 8. I've seen the movie several times, and I'm always blown away at how great every one of them performs.
There's a magical quality to the movie. It does a great job of capturing the lives and emotions these kids are going through. The adventure they undertake is a great mystery that slowly unveils itself throughout the story. Several reviewers hate the ending, but I thought everything worked.
The movie is filled with a sense of innocence and wonder in the face of some truly scary scenes.
The end-credits, and the accompanying video, are pure joy!",8,0,0,14 June 2020
It Chapter Two," Better and Worse than the First IT
","The biggest problem I had with the first IT was the lack of story. I felt that movie was lots of great scenes, but without much story. The story this time around is much clearer. It just goes off the rails in the final act.
I thought they did a great job with the casting, especially the adult version of Eddie. The actor completely nailed the performance. He even looks like the younger actor all grown up.
If you read the 1,100+ page novel, you know that the movie is very different from the book - as it should be, as the book was a huge letdown. At least for me. Thankfully there are no giant space turtles here.
I loved the humor in the story. Others have complained that there was too much, but I thought it worked.
Overall, the CGI ending is a bit over the top, but if you enjoyed the first one, you should like this one, too.",6,1,1,9 April 2020
Hancock," Imaginative Take on Superheroes
","Hancock is a fun, thrilling, and comedic twist on the usual superhero origin story. The plot has a few twists and surprises. I'm surprised so many other reviewers didn't like how the story got dark toward the climactic final act. I thought it was fantastic. This isn't your typical by-the-book comic book movie.
The effects are great, and the acting is top-notch. The studio could easily have created an entire universe around Hancock and his kind. If you love superhero movies, this one is definitely worth a look.",8,0,0,9 April 2020
Wonder Woman," Wonderful
","Wonder Woman is a fantastic superhero origin story. It's only the final CGI-heavy third act that prevents it from being rated a perfect ten.
Gal Gadot is a standout, and the chemistry between her and Chris Pine is fantastic.
Amazon Island is beautifully brought to life. There are many great set pieces. One of the best is the No Man's Land scene. Gives me chills every time I see it.
My guess is the super-low reviews are Marvel fan boys. IMO, Wonder Woman rates as one of the top superhero origin movies.",9,4,14,14 June 2020
