The Blair Witch Project," One Creepy Film!
","Oh, man! I'm glad I knew going in that this movie wasn't real. All I'm gonna say is that ending freaked me out! It's 12:30 in the morning and I'm jumping at any noise I hear. Your wanna be freaked? You wanna be creeped out? Go see this movie!",8,1,2,21 August 1999
The Patriot," Consider it your patriotic duty to see this movie!
","This is a movie you must see! Especially if you consider yourself,.....well, a patriot! There is nothing I could find wrong with this movie. Up and down the lineup, terrific acting all around. Excellent story, though some will say this is essentially 'Braveheart II'. The comparison is inevitable, but it's only because the stories deal with the same theme, freedom. I did feel a swell of patriotism watching this movie, and unlike Independence Day, it wasn't contrived.	I'm guessing that this movie will only play well in this country. I don't think it will go down well in Brittian, but hey, it wasn't written for them!
	If you consider yourself an American, or moreover a patriot. Consider it your duty to watch this movie!",10,1,3,2 July 2000
There's Something About Mary," One of the funniest movies ever made!
","Oh, this one is a sidesplitter! Warning! This movie is not for the politically correct. Nor is it for those who go for highbrow humor. That having been said, this is one of those movies where I wasn't just laughing, I was making that noise people make when they've laughed so hard they can't breathe anymore! Ben Stiller does a great job as the dorky but likeable Ted. Diaz is gorgeous as Mary. Dillon is superb as the sleazeball Pat 'I work with retards' Healey. Brett Favre needs to work on his acting a bit though..........Anyways, this is a definite must see if you have no hang-ups about what's being made fun of. Enjoy!",9,1,1,25 February 1999
The Matrix," Go see this movie
","You don't want to leave your seat during this movie. Going in to it I figured that if nothing else, the effects would make for some good eye candy. And it does, but there is also a captivating story that goes with it to that makes this movie worthwhile entertainment, rather than it being 'Johnny Mnemonic: Part 2'",8,0,0,5 April 1999
