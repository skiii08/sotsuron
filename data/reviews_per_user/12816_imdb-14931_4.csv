Blade Runner 2049," Soulless blockbuster trying to be an artfilm
",Slow and often boring manufacturered artfilm. Missing real story and real characters. Instead just having attempts at slow artsy scened.,6,2,2,24 September 2019
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Surprisingly funny terrible romantic comedy
","Overall this is a terrible romantic comedy. But jokes and acting carries you through.The plot is really stupid, and at times very unpleasant. Some will object to the underage sex angle, some to the stalking, some to the womanizing. What I found most grating was the idea of a sex-class system, where a girl should date someone not on her class level. And the story hinges on a girl dumping a guy for not realizing he is not on her level.On the plus side though, the acting is mostly solid, and there are a lot of really funny moments scattered about. And I do like seeing a womanizer teach another without being a complete Barney Stinson copy. The ending though, Jesus... It is really bad.",6,1,2,15 May 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Mixed bag, but good action
","Don't get me wrong this is a very good action movie.The action scenes are strong and funny, loved seeing Spiderman in action with the Avengers.Unfortunately the plot suffers from having to be incredibly contrived and forces our favorites heroes to be psychotically stupid in order to get the to Avengers vs Avengers that it wanted to get to.In some way this is Batman vs Superman the good edition. Just as stupid and contrived, but much better action and punchlines.Though if you just want a movie with good action, go ahead, you will love this movie.",5,1,4,17 October 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," Inconsistent action movie
","So this is the quintisential super hero movie. A bit of comedy, but not too much, and not enough to make the movie funny, a bit of plot but it is all over the place and mostly made out of plot holes and idiocy, and lots and lots of action for action sake, all leading nowhere in the end.There is some hope a follow up movie can make this part of greater arch, but as it stands on its own, it is just too inconsistent to give you that punch in the gut it was trying to set you up for.",6,2,4,15 September 2018
