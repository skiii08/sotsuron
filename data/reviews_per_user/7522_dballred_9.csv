Howl's Moving Castle," Enjoyable but Unimaginative
","First of all, I'd like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of this film and intend to see it several more times. On a technical level, Miyazaki has elevated the traditional 2-D animated film above the cheesier but more realistic 3-D Computer-generated works that seem to prevail everywhere else. Whether he used computers to simulate the 2-D look is beyond my current knowledge, but I applaud his attempt to abandon the technique that even crept into his previous work, _Spirited Away_.The film is *very* loosely based on the original novel. In fact, only the basic premise and the main characters seem to have survived Miyazaki's scalpel. As a story, it is unimaginative and trite. Furthermore, the characters lacked depth. Unlike he did with _Kiki's Delivery Service_, Miyazaki failed to improve upon the original work. All is forgiven, though. This is one-hundred percent pure uncut Miyazaki. I was left with the impression that he was going to have fun with a project, this was the project, and he had a great deal of fun with it. Joe Hisaishi, once again, provided excellent musical support. I gave this film an 8.",8,18,35,2 December 2004
The Hustler," The Definitive Movie About Pool
","This is, without a doubt, the closest anything out of Hollywood ever came to touching the soul of a pool player. Paul Newman plays 'Fast Eddie' Felson, a young player from California who travels east to take on the ultimate challenge: to beat 'Minnesota Fats,' played by the late Jackie Gleason.Willie Mosconi, probably the greatest pool player who ever walked the Earth, was technical adviser and choreographed many of the game sequences. On technical merit alone, this film is a pool player's classic. Beyond that, however, the way 'Fast Eddie' takes to his skills and relationships pushes this film out as a classic for the general audience. In one scene, he is describing what it is like to be really good at something. It is one of the best speeches about excellence I have ever heard. This is one of my top three films. On a scale of ten, I give it an eleven.",10,45,58,12 January 2005
My Neighbor Totoro," I Loved this film
","I saw this film for the first time on Japanese television a couple of years ago. This is one of the few feel-good films I ever saw that drove this normally left-brained engineer to a teary-eyed sentimentality. It is a story about two sisters, Mei and her elder sister Satsuki, who had just moved to a house in the country. Their father, a teacher, looks after them as their mother is ill in the hospital. While playing in the garden, Mei sees a strange furry character and takes after it. The events that follow lead her and Satsuki to a wondrous backyard adventure with magical creatures. Are they real? Imaginary? This film has a cuteness factor that runs off the scale. As it is with most Japanese films, it really needs to be seen in its original language form, subtitled if necessary, rather than the dubbed VHS and DVD forms available in the US.",10,1,2,31 October 2002
Lost in Translation," Lost Without Translation
","As an American who travels to Japan frequently, I found this film parochially American. I also found it offensive. The parochial part is the fact that the Japanese dialog is presented without subtitles. It is, of course, intended to convey the notion of a totally bewildering environment for the main characters. Unfortunately for the film, I understood the Japanese dialog almost perfectly--as do millions of Japanese, so I cannot feel that sense of bewilderment.
It's offensive to the Japanese. There is one scene in the film--at a hospital--that would never happen in Japan. No hospital--I don't care how tiny--would persist on speaking pure Japanese if they sensed the patient did not understand. They would do their best to speak understandably or find someone who can, and English speakers abound in hospitals.
Another offensive part is the notion that Hollywood is trying to present its own morality as somehow acceptable and even majestic. The principle character, a washed-up actor older than dirt, finds a normal monogamous marriage somehow draining enough to be attracted to a female child (in her very early twenties) while on a business trip away. Sorry, it may be a normal reaction for an older man to be so attracted--but it hardly qualifies at any sympathetic level. This female child, also in a monogamous married relationship and similarly drained, finds this geezer somehow appealing enough to approach him in a manner that is hard to confuse with anything but a come-on.I'm not going to go into how far the relationship develops, but it can safely be put into the unfaithful category as far as their spouses are concerned. I would recommend viewing it--barely. I gave this film a 6 out of ten.",6,1,3,19 April 2004
Lilo & Stitch," At Last: A Full-Dimension Disney Character
","This is the best Disney product since Pinocchio--thanks largely to the depth of the main human character, Lilo.  The Disney studios have a particular affection for the one-dimensional character--and this film is no exception. In this case, as opposed to the disappointing Atlantis epic, the technique works as it should--because most of the characters are from the same ethnical background.  Lilo, however, is the aspect of this film elevating it above the other modern Disney animations. She can't be described by one word or even by the 1000 words allowed for this review.  Stitch, her mutant space-pet, is pure Disney and pure fun, following the edgey smoke trails and paw tracks of Aladdin's Genie or Mulan's Dragon.  I heartily recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it solely because he or she has given up on Disney. I give it a rating of 9 out of 10.",9,1,1,31 October 2002
Spirited Away," Miyazaki's Best Yet!!
","Here's an easy one: If you come across a shop with a sumptuous spread of food and the proprietor is not in sight, do you: (a.) Start eating the food with the intent of settling later, or (b.) abstain from eating--regardless of the temptation--because it was wrong. In the film, two out of three respondents answered (a.) and were transformed into what they behaved as: pigs. Such starts out Hayao Miyazaki's finest work to date, 'Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi.' ('Spirited Away' in US theaters) This is the finest animated film I have ever seen and is near the top of my list of films of any genre.The main character of the story, a 10-year old girl named Chihiro Ogino, is a normal child thrust by her parents into a strange world and is immediately left to fend for herself--as she was the one out of three who chose the correct course of action by not eating the food. Throughout the remainder of this beautiful film, she is faced with numerous choices--each crafted by Miyazaki to emphasize the importance of living a virtuous life. While the specific cases use things from Japanese folklore, traditions, and culture (and Miyazaki's incredible imagination), the fundamental virtues apply Universally to all.One admonition: the English-dubbed version, though touted as being true to the original, actually changes the nature of the film slightly.The original Japanese language release, subtitled if necessary, is a truer rendition of Miyazaki's imagination.On a scale of ten, I'd give this one an 11.",10,2,3,1 November 2002
The Incredibles," The Incredibles are Incredibly Credible
","This is an absolute gem of a film. John Lasseter and crew totally upended the superhero paradigm and replaced it with something far more entertaining with depth and, oddly, a strange credibility that made me feel the Incredible family was actually pretty credible. All of the family members have individual strengths and weaknesses, they bicker and quarrel a lot, yet they ultimately love each other--and you feel it all in this film.In the periphery, there were numerous supporting characters with decidedly less dimensionality, yet there wasn't a trite character in the lot. They were quirky in new and interesting ways.To be fair, this is no romp-in-the-park light-hearted film like Toy Story or Nemo. This film is a bit darker and more violent than other Pixar films, but it is one of the best--if not the best--of the lot. I gave this film an easy 10.",10,0,1,12 November 2004
Grave of the Fireflies," A Very Important Animated Film
","Hotaru no Haka ('Grave of the Fireflies') is arguably the most important animated film ever made. One thing is a near-guarantee: after seeing this film, you will be in a different state of mind. The setting is Japan, shortly before the conclusion of the Pacific War (WWII), when the US initiated the incendiary bombardment of Japanese cities. Though not as well known as the Atomic events at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the death and destruction caused by the incendiary devices against Japan's major cities was actually far greater. This is a story of two young sibling children caught up in the events, winding up orphaned and without a place to live. They must find a way to survive without the luxury of adult care, because the adults are also desperately trying to find a way to survive. There is really no way of discussing plot or even the point of view of this film without revealing too much. All I can say, with emphatic voice, is 'SEE IT.''Grave of the Fireflies' is available everywhere in video rental stores. The only version I know is subtitled, so my usual admonition against a dubbed version doesn't apply. I give this film a 10 out of 10 rating.",10,0,1,7 November 2002
The Last Samurai," Check Your History at the Door and Enjoy!
","Overall, I liked the Last Samurai--as a story. As a representative piece of Japanese history, though, I'm sure there are plenty of purists out there holding their noses.Hollywood has this real penchant for producing historical figures who are uncharacteristically 21st Century Politically Correct for whatever era they live in. Tom Cruise is no exception in this film. He, with conventional wisdom no older than forty years, had no respect for Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer or his tactics. A genuine military contemporary of Custer, however, would realize he was the youngest US officer to reach the grade of Brigadier General during the Civil War. He didn't reach that rank for having a good filing system.What about the premise of the film? Tom Cruise, a has-been hero from the wild west, is hired to help develop Japan's new modern Army. How does being an individually brave person who can handle a weapon and ride like a trick shot artists translate into being an organizer and trainer of an entire army? Had such a person demonstrated all those skills in military service, he would have been promoted like Custer was.Beyond that, it's hard to believe his purpose for being in Japan: building the Army. The film seems to imply it is for fighting an internal rebellion. Sure, there have been people like Katsumoto in the film known to operate briefly even in modern times (Noted author Yukio Mishima, who committed seppuku about 35 years ago, is a recent example of such a person). Nonetheless, they haven't been a serious threat to Japan's order since the early shoguns a couple of hundred years prior to the Meiji era. Japan developed a modern army, all right, but the purpose was external--there were issues with the Chinese and the Russians. I think the intent here was to turn the tables for the character in the film. He went from fighting on the side with the guns against the side with the bows and arrows to the opposite situation. In that respect, the film succeeds. The characters had depth and the story was fascinating. Unlike many American films with Japanese themes, I would have no problem recommending this film to a Japanese--provided he doesn't take history too seriously. I gave the film a seven.",7,0,1,19 December 2003
