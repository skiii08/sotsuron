It," I kind of hated it.
","Most of the movie is disjointed 'scary' visions every character has to have. It's like there's 4 different scenes, but EVERY character has to have them. 'This is what I'm scared of', 'this is me getting bullied', 'these are some 'scary' scenes', 'this is me standing up to someone'. And then they hit the poor clown with baseball bats and steel rods for half an hour. It was was just boring.Pennywise wasn't godawful. That's as much as I will compliment him. Tim Curry was better.Also, holy **** can someone fire the sound editor? EVERY TIME something even mildly paranormal or supposedly scary was happening some moron kept banging a piano, or blowing a trumpet, or whatever instrument made those noises. Can I have a moment to enjoy the creepiness or get unnerved by something first? Damn!I have no nostalgia attached to the miniseries, but it was better.",4,58,110,11 September 2017
Pacific Rim," Tedious nonsense from start to finish.
","Pacific rim is a movie with a lot of problems, but first the good things: The monster design is great. It's very imaginative and impressive. The visual effects are some of the best I've seen. Actors do a fine job. The problems start with a script devoid of any sense or a good story... or suspense or surprises for that matter. This is a movie that cannot be spoiled because you'll know everything that's gonna happen 10 minutes before it does anyway. I never cared for any of the characters. They break rules all the time, endanger other people, fight among themselves and don't do enough good to counterweight that behavior. The fight scenes are pretty unimpressive despite the great CGI. They just get boring after a couple hits when you start wondering why don't they just shoot the monsters? In fact, why build giant robots anyway? That's a horrible idea! There's hundreds of better ways to kill those things. Flying plasma cannons. A satellite laser. Anything! Why punch them when you can shoot them? People say it's a homage to cartoons, but it doesn't work as that either. The drama just doesn't work when people are that stupid. Maybe if the characters were interesting or at least likable and a better story I wouldn't care about logic flaws so much. As is they should've made at least some excuses for their stupidity.Sometimes the sound mixing is pretty bad. I really struggled to hear what characters were saying during fight scenes. The music goes to 11 and the sound of things hitting each other just makes the voices inaudible.I won't even mention the hundreds of things that didn't make any sense. If this movie was going for serious drama: it failed. If this movie was going for ironic fun: it failed. By the way, the main characters at the end would've died of decompression sickness. So there's that.A surprisingly bad, joyless and tedious experience.",4,7,16,14 July 2013
