The Blair Witch Project," What was all the hype about?
","With the release of the film here in England being after that of America I waited with anticipation for it to arrive.What a disappointment. The plot was lame, and there was nothing to frighten even a child.Even the old film 'House on Haunted Hill' was a good laugh but 'Blair Witch Project' could not even provide this. I don't know if this was just aimed at the American market, but it does not come under the English description of 'Horror'.I could not recommend this film to anyone, so if I had to give it a mark out of 10, it would have to be 2 (this is because I must admit I have seen a couple that are worse).",Null,0,0,31 October 1999
