Marie Antoinette," lacking in real substance but only if viewed from a narrow minded perspective
","Sofia Coppola's previous films have been groundbreaking and recognised as some of the most incredibly shot pictures in history. Marie Antoinette is not lacking in the visual sense at all but it does tend to lack some substance.On watching the commentary and reading what Coppola had to say about the film has changed my mind as to how effective it was.If viewed as a 'period drama' it loses it's quality and becomes boring without enough background or script. But when it's viewed as the perspective of a young woman coping with such changes and such an extraordinary life it becomes clear what Copolla wants us to see in this film.Possible one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen with a breathtaking soundtrack and an eclectic array or sets, costumes, makeup and props it certainly looks the part of that era. Kirsten Dunst has a childlike quality about her acting making her perfect for the role, she captures the character well and as the only medium the audience has to the films plot she copes well.Don't view this film as another 'The Madness of King George', view it as a diary entry made by Marie Antoinette at that time in her life (do your research). In saying that, this may not appeal to all audiences and certainly won't appeal to those who have a short attention span but to those who will like it, will love it.",5,1,1,22 March 2007
