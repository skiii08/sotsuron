The Monuments Men," So boring ! So.....BAD !
","This movie seems to have everything to make ad least a decent action / entertaining movie: Decent budget , Excellent cast & what it seems a good subject for a blockbuster ( nazi art robbery during the WWII & especially during the nazi 'debacle' ).But It isn't . The guilt to a messy unattractive script. No thrill, no commitment no pace at all . This movie seems to be a totally FLAT EKG !And you don't have to wait for long to be bored ! After only the first 20mn it started to smell bad with pointless scene who seems to fall on the screen haphazardly . Even the experienced actors start to loose it & their play is often out of the tracks !Special BAD comment for my national fellow in the movie ( Georges wasn't a so nice friend to put him in such a miserable movie ! ) : Mister Jean Dujardin ! Who usually play great ( as good in drama or comedy ) , act really poorly here ! :( Have a look on the 'presentation' scene :( Perhaps challenging Marion Cotillard for the worst french acting scene in a US Movie ?? But unlike Marion ,he only seems to wake up to really act when he's wounded & the death scene is not as bad but there again the poor scene cut's waste it ! Fortunately, he 'dies' from his 'wounds' ending his misery in this pathetic 'movie'.One positive point : the only one who seems to me, not to sank deep is .....The Aussie girl aka the sweet cute Cate Blanchet ! Ad least she was smart enough to avoid the trap to try to talk french ! She craftily speak English with a french accent, nice & it works +++.But her too saw her play smash into the messy blury scenario who makes her look like a icy unpolite useless bi...characters and her impact on the 'action' or if you prefer the 'story' is : absolutely NONE.Who did the writing & the post production ??? Obsiously George cloney is not Clint Eastwood ! Perhaps it should pay him a call ...& a few lessons !. to be brief : movie utterly disappointing . Don't waste your time like i did.",3,3,5,15 March 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Cerebral diarrhea
","The previous episode was , ad least entertaining ...this one is just SO boring and sometimes so depressing ...3 hours trying not to yawn and more difficult , not to fall asleep ( Hopefully the fluctuation of the sound level between dialog scene and action one help me not to ! )PS : there's a good new , though , it's supposed to be the last one !",3,82,136,4 August 2019
