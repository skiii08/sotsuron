Skyfall," One of the worst Bond movies
","It's one of the worst Bond movies because the filmmakers of this series all too frequently have operated under the delusion that stringing a few decent action sequences together can somehow make a Bond movie into a compelling spy movie. There is no more-direct evidence of that idiotic thesis than this movie. The script is awful - it is the very definition of an inherently flawed story determining characters' actions, rather than the other way around. The acting had kernels of greatness, which could have blossomed had the script not been awful.As far as combining espionage and action in effective stories that actually demand audience attention, the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series has already beaten the Bond series to the punch.",2,4,7,4 April 2020
1917," An excellent war movie
","This is an immersive, exciting depiction of some of the fighting of World War I. Sam Mendes should have cut or otherwise drastically modified the scene with the baby, but otherwise the movie is full of lean acting and dialogue that aren't overdone.",8,0,2,14 January 2020
