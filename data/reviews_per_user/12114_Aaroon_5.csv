Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of my favorite movies of all time
","I LOVE this movie. It's one of my favorite movies of all time and one of my favorite things to ever exist. I can only give this movie a 10 out of 10 here on IMDb, but my real rating is 100/10. I love essentially every second of this movie and every character in this movie. I love Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Queen Amidala/Padme, Anakin, Palpatine, Jar Jar, C3P0, R2D2, Yoda, Watto, Mace Windu, Darth Maul, and everyone else. Love love LOVE this movie.",10,5,6,6 August 2017
The Bourne Ultimatum," One of the best movies and things to ever exist
","My true ratings for the first three original Bourne movies. Identity: 1,000 out of 10. Supremacy: 1,000 out of 10. Ultimatum: 1,000 out of 10. Watch this movie, watch The Bourne Identity, and watch The Bourne Supremacy. Appreciate and love them...and if you don't...well then I don't know what to say to you.",10,0,0,8 June 2017
The Bourne Identity," One of the best movies and things to ever exist
","This is one of the best movies and things to ever exist in the history of the universe. I love this movie so much and it is an absolute must- see in my completely honest opinion. I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie but let's just say it's a lot. Everything about this movie is incredible...and the soundtrack is just incredible by John Powell. Here on IMDb I can only give this movie a maximum of 10 out of 10, but my true rating is 1,000 out of 10.",10,1,1,1 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Can't compare to the original 6 and Rogue One
","Personally for me, Rey and Finn just don't seem like the kind of people who belong in the Star Wars universe. Whenever I saw them I couldn't think of Star Wars 100% and couldn't immerse myself in that universe, but whenever I saw Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, C3PO, R2D2, and Luke, I thought and was immersed in the world and universe of Star Wars. Kylo Ren was OK, but an issue I have is how is he supposed to be Han and Leia's son when he doesn't even have the same hair color as either one of them? He has black hair and Han and Leia both have like light brown hair? The space battles were amazing though, I loved seeing Tie Fighters and X-Wings and whatnot again, THAT is most certainly Star Wars. Personally I would have loved to see George Lucas direct as well but what's happened has already happened. To sum it up, basically it was Rey and Finn who mainly gave me the negatives of this movie. I don't know if they just aren't the best actors or what, but they just have this look on their face that takes me out of the movie and makes me just see their actual selves, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, and not who they are supposed to be in the universe of Star Wars in this movie. They way they acted and spoke, and what they said (not all the time) just didn't seem believable and felt so un-star wars like for me, and yeah obviously what they said wasn't necessarily the actors fault, but rather the writers' faults. The movie just felt like it tried so hard to be a fan-service to general star wars fans and didn't try to feel like it was Star Wars and an actual movie. It should have tried to just be a natural Star Wars movie and then people like me would enjoy it, but one of the problems for me was casting Daisy Ridley and John Boyega. I wish episode 7 could have just been all about Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, Luke, C3PO, and R2D2. I guess maybe I'm just not a huge fan of young characters/people. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are too young and I think I prefer movies where everyone is at least like late 20s or at least 30 years of age. But again, this is just an entirely personal personal opinion.",7,1,10,27 December 2016
The Bourne Supremacy," One of the best movies and things to ever exist
","Here on IMDb I can only give this movie a 10 out of 10 but my true rating is 1,000 out of 10. This without a doubt is one of the best movies of all time and one of the best things of all time. Everything about this movie is amazing. If you've already seen The Bourne Identity but for some reason have yet to see this, then WHAT are you waiting for? I've seen this movie so many times and have listened to its soundtrack so many times...speaking of the soundtrack...it is probably my favorite movie soundtrack of all time. This movie is just downright a masterpiece in my completely honest opinion and as I've already stated before but will state again...one of the best THINGS to ever exist in the universe and history of the universe. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!",10,1,1,2 June 2017
