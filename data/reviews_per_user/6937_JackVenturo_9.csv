Men in Black 3," Loved it, best of the trilogy.
","Greetings Movie Lovers and Movie Makers! This month we will be discussing 'Men in Black 3' of course you can't talk about a sequel without talking about the one that started it all. So let's travel back in time! (Fitting isn't it?) Back to a simpler era, Back in the day when things when things where less complicated, and our modems where loud and obnoxious 1997! 'Men in Black' was out in the theaters and we loved every minute of it! Why? Because it was new and fresh, it was sci-fi and comedy, it had gadgets and special effects that where not over the top, it had a bit of the new world (CGI) and a bit of the old world (Rick Baker) but of course you can't forget, the movie was pining together two of our favorite actors Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. We had fun watching it! Until we saw 'Men in Black 2' (2002) well, things got a little weird, the love interest from the first movie was gone and a new love interest was introduced who at the end of the movie was well, gone! And it left us with a weird feeling of abandonment, the two movies felt a bit unfinished. Of course we didn't feel this stronger than when we heard about 'Men in Black 3' and then to hear all of the behind the scenes fiasco that where occurring with the production of the film, (They have no ending, its being rewritten by Will Smith, etc. etc.) Let's get to the point! Jack the 'The Film Lover' says... 'Men in Black 3' was FUN! It was a good ride! It had the best villain out of the three films and dare I say it? The best MIB so far. Even though you changed the recipe and replaced actors and took out some familiar ones. I loved it But how? and why? Well to answer these questions here is Jack 'The Filmmaker' when making a sequel you need to remember your audience. They are coming back to see the continuing story of your hero (In this case Heroes) you want to see what they are up to again, and see them get into and out of the same jams as they did before! and well maybe a couple of new ones. But remember like a great recipe for a good meal you need to change things up a bit for the next time your guests visit, maybe a new diner set or a new side dish or wine to go along with the main course. How about a new actor? Or a new era in time! And how do you do all of that successfully? 'MIB 3' did it! Tommy Lee Jones was replaced with Josh Brolin for most of the film and even though this was a risky move, he pulled it off and it's actually not that noticeable. When dealing with Time Travel you need to remember the holly trilogy 'Back to The Future' like an ex-girlfriend we hold everyone else up to her standard! And BTTF is no different. The basic principal to follow when making a time travel movie? KEEP IT SIMPLE! Set the rules and follow them, that's it, MIB 3 did it just right. Of course I'm not about to give you any spoilers that the trailer already revealed but let's talk about the premise, 'Go back in time to save your friend'. The film goes from saving the world like all the others before to a very personal matter, which adds to the edge of your seat excitement. And like a great 'Part 3' it brings you back full circle to the first film at the end. Boris was a real threat with secrets of his own. His weapons where original and his threat was high! the movie on the whole has it all, action, adventure, fun, excitement, sci –fi and above all heart! A movie without heart is just flash and boom and who cares about flash and boom unless you have a reason for it. Oh and Jack 'The Parent' says take the kids but have a talk with them about what Special Effects are and that the weird aliens in the movie are not real, there are some things in it that could give a kid nightmares, so far my 4, 8 and 9 year old loved it! Till next time folks this is Jack, signing off!",7,0,2,3 January 2017
Iron Man 3," Three point of view review.
","I grew up on DC Comics, and my wife grew up on MARVEL Universe so there is a bit of tension in the house over what heroes to worship. Iron Man was not really on my radar as a kid, Batman, Superman, Spiderman, these guys where who I was when I played at the park with my friends. So when 'Iron Man' (2008) came out, I was not all too excited. I saw it and liked it but by the time Iron Man 2' (2010) came along I was a full fan. Then of course you have all the other Marvel Superhero movies 'Captain America', 'THOR', and the countless of thousands of 'HULK' movies. (Alright there is only one true Hulk; we all know who it is.) Which all lead up the 'The Avengers'. Now by this time I was drooling and waiting and peeing my pants after the end credits of every movie and so on and so on. Now we have 'Iron Man 3' which continues where 'The Avengers' left off. The biggest complaint people are having about this movie is 'Where are the rest of the Avengers and why aren't they helping him?' First off, it's not like they all don't live in LA and they didn't move in together and well you have to wait for all of their sequels coming out 2014, 2015 to see what they were doing while 'Iron Man 3' was happening. Can you picture it? 'MTV's The Real World: Avengers' I would actually watch that!Jack 'The Film Lover' says... I liked the movie. It was fast and well passed and the necessary slow parts where not painfully slow. There were some surprises and twists along the way that change your view on many things. I was OK with them, no big deal to me but remember I never read the comics so the movies can do whatever they want and I won't be blogging about how they destroyed my childhood by changing one key detail about Iron Man. The one thing that bothered me was the villains. They were a bit weird to me. I couldn't really put my finger on agendas and plans. Yes of course the monologues they gave told you everything but the whole time I asked myself. 'Why, so what?' They didn't really sit well and make me feel as if there was a real solid threat. You know I never spoil the fun for you so I will stop there. Jack 'The Filmmaker' says 'The Avengers' was a very well made movie, but there was one piece of dialogue that bothered me. Captain America says to Tony Stark 'Big man in a suit of armor, take that away what are you?' Tony's reply was awesome and funny and smart and witty but it cut him, it changed him, it affected him. Aside from his quick self-defense rant, we see what it did to him in 'Iron Man 3' and we see how it changed him as a hero, a man, and an individual. We see what happens when you strip him of everything. 'Iron Man 3' fixed everything and ended and began so many things all in one spin. Jack 'The Parent' says As a parent of five girls it can sometimes be difficult to get them interested in movies like 'Iron Man 3' and this movie did fall of their radar, so it was a wife and me, date night mission. BUT I can say as a father of five girls that it is also very hard to find a movie that displays women's strength and women as more than just something to save or just another problem for the hero. And yes this movie did have a lot of that but Pepper Potts does kick some ass in this movie showing some skills and strength in her own right. I personally would not have a problem with my girls watching this movie at all; it's fun, adventurous, and creative. It ignites ideas of protecting the ones you love.",8,0,1,3 January 2017
World War Z," Three point of view review.
","Greetings movie lovers and movie makers! This month we will be discussing 'World War Z'Jack 'The Film Lover' says... I love to be scared, I mean really scared. I often just freak myself out at home running up the stairs and hide under my bed sheets, just for fun.I love a good scary movie. Having said that, today's scary movie never really provided that feeling of fear that tickles down your spine. I have a short list of movies that trigger that spine tingling fear you want, 'The Exorcist', 'The Ring'. I also have a few that deserve an honorable mention, 'The Omen', 'The Shinning' and now 'World War Z'. I haven't seen 'The Conjuring' yet but I'm told it will be on my list. The right mood is necessary to create the right place and frame of mind, bringing you into the fear with the film, like the nights you set yourself up in front of the TV for some 'Walking Dead'. The anticipation gets to you more than anything.Speaking of 'Walking Dead' how awesome is that show? Are you a fan? Then you will love 'World War Z' even more, but don't connect the two. These are different universes as well as zombie types. The word zombie actually gets used in the movie and the world knows what they are.I LOVED 'World War Z'. There is so much to talk about I I'm not even sure where to begin. I can't spoil the fun for you so I can't really say much! Except for prepare to be jolted. Jack 'The Filmmaker' says How do you make a zombie movie in the middle of the zombie crazed year where everywhere you turn its zombie this and walker that? How do you make something fresh again? By making it new! These are zombies like you've never seen before. The way they come at you. The way they crawl, turn, move, run and brake glass to get you. The way they pile up like ants on a dead spider. There is a desperation these zombies have that makes them genuine and crazy awesome.There's no need to bring up how great an actor Brad Pitt is but this is a bit of a fresh role for him. The dad protecting his family role usually makes you think of Harrison Ford or Liam Neeson, but as you usually expect Brad Pitt delivers!The rumor mills spun huge tales of production issues all way down to reshoots, alternate endings, sequel dropping, casting and more! Story lines were changed and characters removed to bring you this final product. Having read all of the 'what if's' and changes they made, the final product is brilliant. There may be a slight problem with one of the changes which made the ending what it is and not really leaving it open for sequels. But as I'm sure you know that has never stopped anyone from making a sequel, a new director may spin more tales of madness! So get ready! Watch this movie and prepare for part 2!Jack 'The Parent' says Unless you want to traumatize your child, or just ruin a good night's sleep by having them wake up every night crying, don't let them see this movie. I mean duh! But do tell them that in case of anything like the Zombpocalipse does happen THEY BETTER LISTEN to you! Often times in movies like these I see the kids doing stupid things and being to blame for getting into trouble. Kids, just listen to your parents! Train your kids to run this way not that way. Leave that toy behind, wear your seat belt. Run don't stand there screaming.",5,2,3,3 January 2017
Ted," Three point of view review.
","Greetings Movie Lovers and Movie Makers! This month we will be discussing 'TED'. When you are a fan of 'Family Guy' and/or adult humor in general you get excited when you see a new RED BAND trailer for a comedy like 'TED' and let me tell you I was on the edge of my seat with anticipation for this movie and watched the trailer several times showing it to my friends and laughing every minute. My high expectations where my downfall Jack 'The Film Lover' says... 'TED' was funny but not hilarious, I liked it, but I didn't love it. I expected more and maybe even too much, I wanted to have fun with this one, I wanted to feel like the cast & crew of 'Family Guy ' where going to elevate themselves to the big screen and get a standing ovation. I liked the movie; don't get me wrong but maybe they shouldn't have tried so hard to NOT be like 'Family Guy' would it be so wrong to add a little more 'Family Guy'? even some cutaways would have been great. It's a fun movie and has its cute parts and is a pretty good buddy comedy, especially if you are a child of the 80's and know your movies, there are awesome references in there of some of the greats oh and 'Flash Gordon' too. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis where great together and have a nice balance and chemistry on screen, Ted was funny as I expected him to be and the three of them do create a good comedic balance. Oh and let's not forget the amazing party scene and one of the best fight scenes ever captured on film, I mean it's right up there with the bath house fight scene in 'Eastern Promises' what? You haven't seen that movie? Well get a bottle of vodka ready and watch it! It's amazing! Jack 'The Filmmaker' says 'TED' is a tough one, when making a movie to please the fans you have from a different form of media (Movie from TV show) you either have to add more of that media or nothing at all there is no in between. When Trey Parker and Matt Stone did 'Team America' they added tons of 'South Park' and got a great comedy. When Mike Judge made 'Office Space' he added nothing of 'Beavis & Butthead' or 'King of the Hill' and people didn't respond well. Not until a new cult following that has revived one of the greatest movies of all time. But in 1999? It was disappointing, and now with 'TED' I think we needed more 'Family Guy' not just a couple of hint voices here and there and seeing the cast in live action form but a lot more! Or nothing at all. I Love Seth MacFarlane but it took me a while to start retraining my brain to believe I was not listening to Peter Griffin's voice but Ted's voice! Giovanni Ribisi is a great actor but oh boy did he make this movie awkward at times, I wanted to laugh! Not feel uncomfortable. Oh and Jack 'The Parent' says Take no kids to this movie! Well maybe if you have a cool teenager and you want to have a hang out night with them, there are some raunchy jokes in there that might make the living room on family movie night get real quiet and awkward. Late teens will probably get more of the jokes than you do and in that case you might want to take one with you to explain things. God bless the internet!",5,0,0,3 January 2017
Man of Steel," Three point of view review.
","Superman is the king of the super-heroes, so why did it take so long to fix, redo and reboot this franchise? Jack 'The Film Lover' says... Yes Christopher Reeve IS superman, but so was Dean Cain and so was Tom Welling and so was George Reeves and so were YOU last Halloween. So why is it such a big deal that someone else plays him or that it gets remade again? Why are we so protective of our originals? Superman (1978) was good! And so was Batman (1989) Michael Keaton IS batman and now so is Christian Bale.Spiderman was rebooted 5 years after the 'original' ended! And everybody is OK with that? So why do we fear a Superman reboot? Because Superman had an opportunity to return and when he did 'Return' Superman RETURNED badly! We were all scarred by it.So let's move on, how do you resurrect Superman? No not by making him RETURN. Sorry Bryan Singer but no, OK? NO! The only way to resurrect Superman is by completely re- imagining him. That is the only way you will truly enjoy this movie. You must go in there with a blank slate! There is a new superhero in town and he has new rules, new weaknesses and new powers. Henry Cavill does a great job with his new Superman. Amy Adams showed her chops as a tough reporter and Michael Shannon actually shows you why he is a villain. General Zod explains to you what his purpose is and that it is for the greater good, brilliant! And there was just a dash too much Russell Crowe. Just too much, for me. Just sayin.Jack 'The Filmmaker' says visually it was grand; the scale of it, the effects, and the magic was all there. But I also think that maybe it was all a little too quick? I wanted more fly fighting that destroyed buildings. I have seen buildings get destroyed before and I was expecting the fly fighting to be bigger and grander than 'The Matrix – Revolutions'. Don't get me wrong this was a great film, and it's done in a new exciting way. No spoilers here but the last few scenes of Clark Kent really fired my excitement for a sequel. Remember what 'Dark Knight' did for 'Batman Begins'? Yeah well I can't wait for the sequel!I predict 'Man of Steel 2' is going to be 'The Empire Strikes Back' of Superman movies.There are two movies inside 'Man of Steel' the first half where you get reintroduced to this new person and his new life. The second is the Sci-Fi Alien Invasion! Plenty of people are having trouble with the second part, saying it was too cliché, and over the top.Point number one: Superman is an alien. I know we forget this rare fact but he is. Point number two: The threat of this invasion is by far the biggest threat to our planet I have ever seen on film, and it had to be big. Superman had to save the world in order for the world to adore him. He is not like Spiderman or Batman where some story lines have the city question if he is a criminal. Superman has always been the hero and the invasion had to prove it to everyone. Also he is an alien! Don't forget that very important fact.What Superman does to General Zod in the end was a big no no to hardcore Superman fans and it has caused some controversy but you know what? Let it go! This is the Superman we need today! Jack 'The Parent' says We took our five year old and she was bored. Granted she loves movies like this, but the beginning is a bit long and dull for someone waiting to see a man with a red cape fly. By the time that part came she was telling me the explosions are too loud and the movie was 'too dangerous' for her taste. Whatever that means! So maybe leave the kids at home or take the older ones, the ones that want to see it. As far as a message goes? Well not much message going on there aside from honor your parents I guess?",6,1,2,3 January 2017
Wreck-It Ralph," Three point of view review.
","Let's start of by saying I played some video games back in my day I was quite the MASTER at being the second player and not knowing all the cool combos. I was the KING at complaining and whining that I didn't know any of the moves and characters. I was very SKILLED at handling my remote while I waited for my turn to play because my friends never died.Even though I was not a gamer and I played only sometimes, I still saw some familiar faces in this movie (cameos galore). I recognized some cool video game characters that I was glad to see.Jack 'The Film Lover' says... I liked it. Well actually I liked the second half of it. The first half was a bit slow and very establishing and fact filled, which is necessary but well, boring.I always have a favorite side character in a movie and in 'Wreck-It Ralph' the award goes to Sarah Silverman. As soon as she came into the picture the movie really began for me. This has nothing to do with my crush on Sarah Silverman. She actually did a great job playing an adorable little girl with a bit of a lovable potty mouth, not her usual role. The only game I play is 'Call of Duty' nothing else really interests me but hot damn I really hope they make some of the games they showcased in this movie. 'Sugar Rush' looked like wicked fun.Jack 'The Filmmaker' says The marketing of this movie was not so hot. The posters are all wrong. The characters displayed are not the major players so don't expect anything from it. And the other poster with Ralph's 8 bit face? Even worse! This is one of the few movies I have seen without watching the trailer first and there is a reason for it. Digitally animated movies have the worst trailers. Challenge me on it I dare you! 'UP'? 'Finding Nemo'? They tell you nothing about the sentimental value they offer just a bunch of gags and slapstick! I mean find one good digitally animated movie trailer out there! Oh wait, I did it for you, it's this one. I avoid these trailers like math and now that I saw it I can honestly say they did a pretty good job.The digital animation itself was not over the top either not too flashy not too fast and in your face. They had to really slow it down for the video game sequences and this forced the filmmakers to keep a nice flow. Jack 'The Parent' says duh? Take the kids! They will enjoy the wreck out of it! Like what I did there? They will enjoy it more if they have played video games. They will enjoy it more if you cry like a baby during special scenes and they look at you like you are some weird monkey donkey. Yeah it has some scenes so be careful if you are a softie!On a side note there is a lot of name calling (they do it in a cute way) and some punching in the face violence (also done in a cute way) just had to throw it out there for you I mean my kids can take it and we all love that stuff but you never know.",10,0,1,3 January 2017
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Three point of view review.
","The year is 2012. The month is December. The movie? The Hobbit! Of course there is no other movie to discuss than the long anticipated prequel to 'Lord of the Rings' and there is a lot of talk about the movie so let's get started!Jack 'The Film Lover' says... I loved the movie I am a fan-boy of middle earth true. And yes it is also true that I have not read the books because I don't enjoy reading so this will not be a comparison of the book to film translation but that's not why you came here anyway so it's OK. The first trailer was so good that it gave me chills! When the dwarfs start singing I was in! I saw the movie and I left with a feeling of satisfaction. It's rare to have that feeling knowing there will be two more sequels but they did a great job on that. I know there is more to see and I am OK with that. It was interesting to see all the old faces again. Also, there is much talk about the Galadriel & Gandalf relationship in that seemed like it could be a prequel of its own but we won't. We will let time and the rest of the movies reveal that on their own. Huge props to Martin Freeman who just sinks into the role of Bilbo Baggins and Ian McKellen who just sits comfortably back into the robes of Gandalf the Grey. You can't forget to mention the nightmares you get when you think about anyone else other than Peter Jackson directing this movie.Jack 'The Filmmaker' says The Hobbit: An Unexpected PROBLEM. Did anyone else cringe a little when they saw full CGI characters? I mean you are used to Gollum who by the way looks great and more wicked than before, he is an untamed creature in this movie and it is quite scary. There was a problem with the Great Goblin and the trolls as well as Azog the white orc and yes even the goblins too. There was plenty of CGI done in the LOTR movies but this was somehow different. Was it perhaps the frame rate they used? Maybe they tried a different technique? For some reason these characters suffered and it was a bit unsettling for me to watch. The music was great. The filming was awesome. The acting was top notch; however I also have a bit of a problem with the dwarf's beards and hair. Always perfectly quaffed and still, clean and braided and always hair sprayed in the right place was just another little thing that bothered me a bit.Jack 'The Parent' says My four year old daughter loved the movie. She was scared a bit when Gollum showed up. I'm telling you he was crazy! She usually likes fantasy movies of this kind anyway but mostly I would not recommend it for anyone younger than ten because it is a bit long and a bit dark in a lot of areas. It's a good movie for the older kids to watch to see the importance of teamwork and companionship and honor and to finish what you start and not to quit. Plus they will see and learn an awesome way to wash the dishes.",4,0,1,3 January 2017
The Wolf of Wall Street," Three point of view review.
","I LOVED this movie, but my reasons for loving it go deep, first lets hit the surface, I'm a fan of Martin Scorsese, always have been and I love almost everything he does, 'Casino' is one of my favorite movies, I watch it once a year at least. The Love for 'The Wolf of Wall Street' goes beyond entertainment, like all of Martin Scorsese movies this movie has heart.Jack 'The Film Lover' says... 'The Wolf of Wall Street' completes the DEGENERATE TRILOGY! That's Right Part I 'Goodfellas', Part II 'Casino' and Part III 'The Wolf of Wall Street' the story of an innocent man gaining everything he wanted and more and losing it all. Gaining everything he thought he wanted only to find out the life he gets after he loses everything is in fact what he really needed. (1) Henry Hill in 'Goodfellas' Always wanted to be a gangster and after committing crimes and becoming addicted to cocaine he lost everything and went into witness protection to live the rest of his life in peace and make money from his story. (2) Sam Rothstein in 'Casino' was a gambling man who wanted a life of power and money he got all of it and more, and after committing some crimes and getting addicted to power and money he lost everything and retired to San Diego to live the rest of his life in peace and make money from his story. (3) Jordan Belford in 'The Wolf of Wall Street' wanted money and did everything in his power to get it, committing crimes and getting addicted to cocaine he lost everything went to prison and came out the other end to live the rest of his life in peace and make money from his story.This is why I loved this movie, to me it was the final chapter in the poem that Martin Scorsese has been writing, and it sends a clear message. You think you know what you want but once you get it you find out you were not prepared for it so you lose it. It's a classic opera! A modern day Greek tragedy at its best and it's beautifully acted by everyone, I won't even begin to discuss how great Leonardo DiCaprio was, is, and always is! I don't need an Oscar to tell me he is amazing. Jonah Hill didn't even resemble Jonah Hill, he was great! Other people will like this movie because of the money aspect without catching the true meaning of the money aspect, MONEY was the main villain! Take away the money? And you have a movie about a cocaine fueled hobo who beats his wife. The money did not buy anyone happiness because they were all degenerates, and to be a Scorsese degenerate is a beautiful thing, 'Taxi Driver' was a HERO! Think about it along those lines and you will see that all of these characters are just like you and me, give them an inch and they get addicted to cocaine! Jack 'The Filmmaker' says I did get a bit tired of the narrating style and the fast passed action, I know this is part of the story telling but I feel like the movie was really bright and really sunny and the lighting was very clean, this I think was done on purpose of course what it does is it makes you feel uneasy (Dark things are happening in broad daylight, bad things in bright places) but Martin Scorsese always plays with lighting and I think he could have played a bit more with this one so we don't feel rushed. The narrating style of talking straight to the camera was a bit off putting too but again I think that was the point, to make you uncomfortable. Jack 'The Parent' says NO!!! RUN AWAY! Don't let your kids even see the DVD case! Seriously DUH! No kids! It is great fun to watch alone! In the dark when you are really depressed and that's it!",10,0,2,3 January 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," Three point of view review.
","Greetings Movie Lovers and Movie Makers! This month we will be discussing 'The Dark Knight Rises'. I loved this movie. It is no 'The Dark Knight' (2008) which was perfectly made but it does its job as a finale and closing movie. Jack 'The Film Lover' says... I am a Batman fan. I loved it from Adam West to Tim Burton's 'Batman' (1989). Has it been that long already?! There have been tons of Batman movies as well as TV shows and they are all good in their own way. From Adam West to the animated series I use to watch from 1992 to 1995. They all have their own little spice to them. It's like trying to argue which is the best pizza Italy's or New York's. It's all taste and there are different pizzas and Batmans for everyone's taste! What a great world! There are a bunch of little Easter eggs and treats for the batman fan in this movie. From surprise characters to throw backs even returning cast members from previous films. This movie is a fun ride, with mixed emotions and lots of stress. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is the end of a great trilogy and sometimes that's a little hard to swallow. That's why this movie has been criticized by some. It's hard to understand that you can close a story and finish it just right. Going into details will spoil the film for you but you have to remember that Bruce Wayne is a human with no super powers. The movie had to end the way it did. Jack 'The Filmmaker' says When you make a trilogy there are rules to follow. One of the rules is to treat all three movies as one, with a first, second and third act. In the first film you are introduced to the characters (boring). Second you create havoc and put them in horrible places, which is awesome. Third you close it all and end it with a bang which causes sadness, joy and tons of other mixed feelings. 'Batman Begins' showed you that Batman can be real and someone can train and build costumes and armor for such an undertaking as becoming a super hero. 'The Dark Knight' showed you what a sequel should show you. Everything falling apart around the beloved characters we all learned to love from the first film (Think about 'Empire Strikes Back'). The Dark Knight Rises' closes the trilogy in great fashion. Bane was awesome! Aside from sounding a little bit like Sean Connery, he was maniacal, and very tactical. He was no thug, having a plan since the first scene and he was smart. Also to point out one of the best beginning sequences ever! I am not going to say Michelle Pfeiffer is the one and only Catwoman but I AM going to say that her Catwoman WAS Catwoman! Anne Hathaway's character was a Catwoman type of a thief in this movie but not the Catwoman she could have been. Then again, you wouldn't have the ending you got. So in actuality she was the prefect, (see what I did there?), Catwoman in Christopher Nolan's Batman universe. Jack 'The Parent' says The movie is rated PG-13 and well you know how I feel about the rating scale. I think as a parent we all individually need to judge movies ourselves. The whole ripping the heart out of a man's chest and casting him to the fire scene in 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' only got that film a PG and if it was released today it would have been R. Be that as it may, there are some dark issues in 'The Dark Knight Rises' so keep it 13",9,0,1,3 January 2017
