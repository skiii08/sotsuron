Raiders of the Lost Ark," It's an old fashioned serial adventure that has never been duplicated
","When I was 11 years old I saw the front cover of a magazine my Mother was reading and there was Han Solo tied to a stake with some girl. I immediately knew I had to see the movie. When I finally convinced someone to take me it was one of the most magical experiences of my movie going life. Up until then only two movies had made me feel that way in the theater: Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Little did I know that the two great directors had come together to product this masterpiece. It borrows the best of movie serials of the past, the adventure stories and travel pieces of the time, fantasy, history and features the best villains ever in the world: Nazis!!! Yes. These guys stink. I had learned about them in regular school, Hebrew school and TV. I hated them for what they had done to my ancestors and here was Indiana Jones going around kicking Nazi but at every turn. OK so for a little while it looked like they had the upper hand but in the end G-d gave it to them good. Just like they deserved. If all the adventure and excitement wasn't enough the last scene was a perfect blend irony. All that for nothing. I guess in a way the U.S. Government did one thing right. They packed it away in some unassuming box in a cavernous warehouse so that no one would ever find it again. Harder to find than the Well of Souls that place. I loved this movie front to back, beginning to end and it inspired my own writing and creativity. The period and the sets still resonate in my mind. And a soundtrack that just won't quit. Don't get me started on the sheer genius of John Williams' soundtracks. These three men are singlehandedly responsible for my dreams, my fantasies and my adventurous spirit. I wanted to live in the places they created, go where Indiana Jones went and see what he saw. Some say that they ruined cinema but I don't agree. I think they made it great just doing what they loved: Making Great Movies!",10,3,7,22 September 2005
