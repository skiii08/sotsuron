Marie Antoinette," Why the rock music?
","The acting is fine, and it is spectacular to see, but the pace makes short work of even the most patient bhuddist monk. And why the modern rock music? It was an awful mess, not coming close to dovetailing with each situation. The music was more distracting than helpful, or even interesting. My wife and I actually pressed the 'mute' button each time another awful rock song came, so we could at least enjoy the scenery.There are also some problems with the editing.Next time, Sofia, use proper music, or better: do not use it at all. You do NOT know how to choose music, that much you have proved.Not even a good rental.",1,3,7,14 April 2007
WALLÂ·E," Great Achievement in Animation... so-so SciFi with pig-headed 'green' message.
","I went to see Wall-E with my wife and 3 year old; I wanted to see it badly after watching the trailers in IMDb and on TV. I was amazed at the technological and artistic level that Pixar has brought with this movie, by making a world that is very difficult to picture - one of grit, dust, rust, chipped paint, dereliction... this requires a level of detail that previous movies did not show, because of the programming and memory requirements. So, the visuals themselves makes the experience of watching worthwhile.The plot, simple enough (boy meets girl) is nevertheless well told in a very poignant manner. You just gotta love Wall-E and his advances on EVA, trying to woo 'her'. The robots are in themselves works of art.However, the cluelessness of Hollywood had to spoil the movie for me, with an extremely childish 'green' message, showing a lack of understanding of economics that dumbfounded me, and many plot holes you can drive an aircraft carrier through. It was clear that the writer took no care when writing the script, leaving in many instances of irrationality and nonsense.*Warning: Possible Spoilers* For example, Wall-E was able to repair himself using other robots' parts. Why didn't the other robots do the same? What was EVA's purpose? If the executive order given to the Autopilot was NOT to go back to Earth, then why did it bother to send a probe?(It is clear it had to be the first probe back, since Wall-E became surprised the ship it carried it landed in Earth) How come the captain became curious about Earth 700 *years* after they left it? Do Pixar people really think humans prefer to live inside a space-faring shopping mall? If the ship had the technology to keep the inside of it clean, how was it that the builders had NO success cleaning the trash? It is clear the writer or writers have no knowledge of economics. People PAY to have their trash removed. If places to place the trash became scarce, then the price to remove it would have to go up, making people change their habits. This means that the scenario pictured in Wall-E could never happen. The silly environmental message the writers wanted to convey stems from a wrong premise. This failing and the others exposed above, for me, make the movie a good example of bad sci-fi. If judged for its science fiction, this movie would not be any better than Battleground Earth.So, I give it 10 stars for its well told love story, superb artistic achievement... less 5 stars for badly done, badly written, not well thought environmental message.",5,8,18,3 August 2008
