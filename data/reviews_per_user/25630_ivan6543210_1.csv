It," Painful waste of time
","I've read some of reviews and I can't believe someone would describe this movie as interesting, exciting or anything positive. Kids are quite annoying and are using forced humour that I didn't find funny at all. The worst part is that there is no story at all, just some random wannabe scary events that aren't connected. I've been a child not long ago and I remember what movies I considered as good, so even if this movie was supposed to be for children I think it failed in that area also. My advice: don't waste 2 hours of your life watching this.",1,14,26,19 September 2017
