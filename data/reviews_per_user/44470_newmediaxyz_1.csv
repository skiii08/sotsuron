","As a fan of Stephen king and his creativity I love his work. I'm very sure that readers of his work back then had a negative view on his 80s movie version of 'it' back in the day, but books are better than movies...but this one, a remake of the 80s version is plain lame...respect the effort but for reals?? seems like they copied a lot of aesthetics from stranger things and made a distorted plague of the scenes and script from the original movie....too bad I wanted something better. A total under six flick.",5,19,37,14 February 2018
