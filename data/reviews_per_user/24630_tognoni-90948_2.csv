Blade Runner 2049," Amazing build up but falls short
","The atmosphere is what makes this movie: I can't think of any other sequel shot so long after the original that manages to recapture the essence of the original while keeping things modern. Amazing. You can tell most of the sets are 'real' with little CGI used. The visuals, the music, a true masterpiece.Acting is good and Ryan Gosling is almost perfect (although my favourite is Joi). The worst performance is from the guy who's celebrated the most: Harrison Ford. He just doesn't care anymore, I think - or maybe he got a boring script. They should and could have done more with him: after all most of the old guard watching this movie still remembers him as the hero, and wants to see him as the hero, at least in some parts. But he just looks like a bored, old man with nothing in him anymore (not even emotions).*** spoilers *** To me, the problem is that this is a long movie that feels it should be longer. The buildup in the first two hours is amazing...but it's all wrapped up too fast in the last 20-30 minutes. There is little connection with the people who end the story. And there is too little chemistry between Ford and Gosling...and too little emotional reaction after Joi's dismissal.Anyway - a masterpiece, apart from the wrap up, they couldn't have done better. Definitely to be seen in theaters.",8,0,5,8 October 2017
