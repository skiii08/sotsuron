United 93," flight 93
","i was one of the many relatives and friends of the people on flight 93 my cousins best friends daughters friend was on that flight i don't want to mention names i had met her a few times and was at the airport when she left on her doomed flight when i got to see the film i didn't cry as i had heard the story over and over again everyone knows the story from beginning to end but watching the film till made everyone gasp at the end of the film instead of everyone getting up and discussing the film there was a frightening silence as everyone got there breath back this film is not a film to be missed it is thrilling amazingly filmed and just so moving when you see them phoning their loved ones how do they know what they said? answering machines, and interviews i couldn't believe it i was sitting in my living watching TV when the news came on and the scenes of the planes hitting the towers anyway the film is amazing, filled with gore but still makes the film come alive the scenes perfectly shot and there was no weak actor in this film and it brought tears to most people at the end when you see it through th eyes of a passenger as the plane crashes to the ground a film not to be missed",10,1,3,1 June 2006
