Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," So funny it made my head hurt.
","I know a comedy's working if I can't bear to laugh anymore because of the pain. Borat is the only movie this year that's had that effect on me, and it's not because I have a particularly puerile sense of humour, or enjoy watching fat, hairy, naked men wrestling. One thing I do like is to see pretentious people have their pretensions tested in the face of such a formidable adversary as Borat, who will push their airs and PC-pretences to the limits of endurance. The etiquette coach, the society diners, the humour coach (honestly! The very IDEA of a guy getting PAID to explain the subtle nuances of the 'not' joke offends ME!) are all exposed for the highfalutin buffoons they are.Along the way, we also get some painfully honest opinions from ordinary Americans (the rodeo organiser - the only true racist in the movie - and the misogynist frat boys come immediately to mind), which were the only bits I found really offensive, because they were obviously true. Rather than suing the producers, perhaps these people should treat the experience as a lesson: If you don't want people to know you're an a-hole, don't behave like one in the presence of a movie crew.As for Borat's antisemitism, sexism and other offensive personality traits, they are aspects of a CHARACTER. Borat is not a real person. The things he says are simply designed by SBC to elicit responses from those he encounters. If anyone should be offended by this film, it is the population of Kazakhstan, who are made to look like superstitious, incestuous bumpkins. Perhaps Sacha could have INVENTED an '-istan' (a la Austin Powers' Creplakistan) as a point of origin for his character, meaning he could have done all this without offending ANYONE (at least anyone with intelligence enough to see what is really going on in this film) Of course, by 'offending', I mean offending them personally. Anyone who gets squeamish easily or doesn't like seeing people in embarrassing situations might justifiably run screaming for the hills after watching a few minutes of this movie.As for me, there were a few moments when I was thinking 'that is SO wrong' - but I was laughing too hard at the time to really care.The humour in the movie is not for everyone. As (I'm sure) the humour coach would tell you, everyone's sense of humour is different. But most of the stuff people seem to find offensive about this movie is stuff they really shouldn't, because it is the opinion of a man who does not exist, who comes from a culture that probably does not exist (despite his claiming to come from a real place). He is there as a device to upset the sensibilities of some, and to bring out the bigotries of others - to cut through the crap and show people as they are. Naked. Hairy. Ugly.Eugh.Borat Rocks.",10,3,18,17 December 2006
Spider-Man 3," The worst Spidey yet. I LOVED IT!
","This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.Narrative flaws and rough edges aside, however, this succeeds in being far-and-away the most entertaining film of the three, based purely on action and laughs. It is the darkest, the most action-packed, and by far the FUNNIEST Spider-Man yet. This, I suppose, is the upshot of Sam Raimi himself writing the screenplay (with brother and Army of Darkness co-scribe Ivan). The sequence in which Peter turns into the lamest bad-boy in history is a total crack-up. The looks on the faces of the 'laydeez' as he struts along the street like a nerdy, emo-midget Travolta are absolutely priceless.The chase/fight sequence between Peter and Gobby Jr. is brilliant. We fly and fall through the air, not knowing which way is up half the time. Only Sam Raimi could disorient an audience to that extent while still allowing us to keep up with what's going on - AND manage to inject the scene with such style, humour and gravity, all at the same time.Both Sandman and Venom are great to watch. Yes, the special effects are awesome, but it mainly comes down to the fact that both characters are so well cast (no surprise really, given the casting in the previous films). Thomas Haden Church (a very BUFF Thomas Haden Church, I might add) brings real humanity to Flint Marko. We actually empathise with him. Topher Grace is great, too. He has fantastic comic timing, and gives us a very slick, smarmy, but perversely likable Eddie/Venom. He gets some of the best lines (as well as some of the worst).The established cast are all as good as ever, and have now grown nicely into their roles. They all seem comfortable, with the possible exception of James Franco - just because his character has been messed with a bit. But he does a good job considering.And then there's Gwen.Bryce Dallas Howard.(*Sighs*)Nothing much to say, really.I suppose I could say that Gwen would never make it as a model, because she's far too healthy-looking and altogether too attractive.But that might be a little cynical of me.Bryce has a big future in movies. She's a very capable actor, and is obviously extremely photogenic. She just needs to stop doing bad M. Night Shyamalan films. And keep doing good Sam Raimi ones.Speaking of capable, extremely photogenic actors who keep doing Sam Raimi movies, it's good to see Bruce Campbell in a slightly more memorable part this time. I'd never imagined him playing a cheesy French Maitre'D, but he gives a hilarious turn in a classic scene.Yes, this film has problems, but if you just sit back and soak it up, they don't really matter that much. The movie looks great, will make you laugh, and will thrill you as well as move you. Possibly.I can't really speak for everyone. I mean, you might be one of those unfortunate people without a soul.But I love it, in spite of its flaws, and I still think Sam Raimi is one of the best high-profile directors in Hollywood - because he's all about having fun. And that's what it all comes down to with Spider-Man 3.Fun.",9,578,882,4 May 2007
Léon: The Professional," A classic
","It's a much sparer film than many of Luc's others (particularly his subsequent ones), and has a definite small-scale feel about it, which is a good thing. It's brilliantly scripted and directed, and superbly paced...long periods of calm, leading up to bursts of intense action. The humour works well, too.Jean Reno is absolutely top-notch as Leon, the awkward, shy guy who becomes an invisible killing machine whenever he goes to work, and exhibits a sort of childish glee when watching Gene Kelly on the big screen. He's funny, deep, mature and childlike all at the same time, and it's a pleasure to watch.Nat, too, is simply amazing. It's her first movie, and she's only around twelve or thirteen, but I don't think she's given a more accomplished performance since (at least, not in a movie I'm willing to watch). The bit where she's standing at Leon's door sobbing her little eyes out kills me every time.It's nice to see Gary Oldman playing a villain for once ;). He's in peak form here, as a linen suit-wearing, pill-popping, Beethoven-loving, ultra-violent sociopath. He's a total nut-bag, but very cool with it. Even when he's slaughtering innocent women and children, you can't help but like him.Or, is that just me...?Eric Serra's score actually WORKS this time. In some movies I find all that weird, French, electronic stuff distracting. Not here.I'm trying to think of bad points about this film, but can't come up with any. I guess that says it all really.",10,4,6,23 September 2005
The Italian Job," Italian whatnow?
","Okay. This is a remake. And I usually try to judge remakes on their own merits. I usually end up failing, often because the remake HAS no merits (eg. Get Carter, Planet o' the Apes). This movie, however, DOES have quite a bit going for it, it's just that the original Italian Job happens to be one of my all-time favourite movies. So I found it pretty difficult not to think of it while watching this.In theory, this movie should have been crap. First of all, it's set in America. I'm not going into buy into the argument between the English and American film types...English: You're butchering a classic, a film which defined 60's Britain, blahdy blahdy blah!American: Yeah, but you're just jealous 'cos we're better 'an you....for the simple reason that I don't belong to either nationality, and am therefore unqualified. Not that I have any allegiance either way. Honest.Come on, people! There are plenty of other frivolous reasons to fight wars. You don't need to start one over a Mark Wahlberg movie.My problem with it being set in America is that the movie is called 'The Italian Job', and not 'The American Job'. Yes, I know the job at the start of the movie is pulled in Venice, in BOATS ('Boats?' I hear you ask? 'In Venice?'), but that's not really the focus, is it? I suppose, at least, they HAVE chosen to set the main job in a city (LA) where not much effort is needed to create gridlock. But planning to leave themselves a thoroughfare in the chaos kind of defeats the purpose of using Minis, which were used in the original due to their ability to fit through tight spaces in shopping malls, drive through narrow drains and turn on the proverbial 'dime'. Bloody yanks. Sorry. Oh, yes, now I get it! They needed to clear a path because the new Minis are FRICKIN' GIGANTIC, and wouldn't FIT through the narrow spaces in Turin. So they moved it to LA, where everything's BIGGER! Even the DRAINS! IT ALL MAKES SENSE!! Kind of!! Um, maybe!!I seem to remember saying something about merits. Um...oh yeah. The fact that this story isn't a duplicate of the original kind of makes it work like a sequel, if you forget the 30-year gap and the whole England-America thing, and think of Michael Caine and Benny Hill whizzing through Venice in a boat (well, I DID say 'kind of').The script is also pretty funny, and the team have good chemistry. Marky does fine as the straight-man, and his funky bunch of cronies work well as a team. Jason Statham (who would have made an excellent Charlie in a more faithful remake or sequel) is great as the driver and ladies' man, Handsome Rob. Seth Green is funny as Lyle, the computer hacker geek (an obvious update of Benny Hill's Professor Peach). Mos Def, one of the better rapper-turned-actors around, does a good job as Left Ear, the demolitions guy. Edward Norton is okay, but below his usual standard, as the slimy Steve. The big surprise for me, though, was Charlize Theron. I've seen her in quite a few movies, but never thought much of her. I found her kind of wooden, dull, and not even very attractive. But I thought she was great in this. Funny, cool, and very sexy. Maybe it was because she was the only one who got to drive a 'real' Mini, her red Cooper S making a meal out of rush hour traffic. That scene, while entertaining, actually detracts from the rest of the movie, because it just heightens the absurdity of them opting for the NEW 'brick' to pull their job. It's just product placement, I guess.And where was Alan Cumming as Camp Freddie? Talk about a missed opportunity!Anyway, It's a serviceable enough crime caper movie, but with logical holes big enough to drive three armoured cars through. It's no Ocean's Eleven, and it's not a patch on the original Italian Job. But it's good fun.",7,0,0,18 August 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Hype terminates movies...
","...but strangely, in the lead-up to T3, I didn't encounter ANY of the saturation advertising. I heard about it: 'Hey, have you seen the trailer for T3? That T-X looks sooooo hot!' But somehow it passed me by. The only hype I encountered was in my own mind. And that was mostly concern that it might suck. I was afraid Arnie might be past it. I was afraid the lack of Cameron panache might result in a lame sequel, rather than a great new instalment in a great series. But then I thought: That T-X looks sooooo hot! So I went to see it.And I'm glad I did. This is no epic like T2. But it's definitely a worthy addition to the franchise. It's more reminiscent of T1, in that it's like a low-budget, B-grade sci-fi actioner. With a bit of a brain. And a HUGE budget. My kind of movie.To my mind, the biggest (well, only) flaw with T2 was that Jim unwittingly created a sort of paradox. To wit: No Cyberdyne = No Skynet = No War = No Terminator = No Kyle Reece Time Travel Caper = No John Connor = No End To Cyberdyne = Skynet = War = Machines Win. Oops.T3, in explaining its premise (or justifying its existence) sort of solves this paradox. But in so doing, it creates a new one, concerning John's message to his mother in T1, the philosophy which becomes her driving force in T2. Maybe he was just being cheeky, seeing what crazy things his words might make her do. But then, maybe not.On top of introducing a new philosophical slant to proceedings, the folks behind T3 have expanded the story and introduced new characters, while keeping the cast quite small.The action sequences are AWESOME. One chase, involving a crane, a fire engine and several police cars, is one of the most spectacular (not to mention EXPENSIVE-LOOKING) I have seen in recent times. Mostly because there appear to be few visual effects involved. Not to mention HEAPS of wrecked cars.Arnie may be getting on, but he is still the Terminator. His skin may sag a little, but he's an old model. Surely Terminators get wrinkles. No-one else can punch through a wall like Arnie.Nick Stahl is fine as an older John Connor. I like the way the character is introduced. A lot has happened to him since he helped stop Judgement Day. And he's the worse for it. He starts out a little frazzled, then gets MORE frazzled as the situation escalates. Nick portrays this well.I have to admit, I had reservations about Claire Danes being in this movie, as it's not in keeping with her usual...thing. But she's playing a character who isn't used to being hunted by an evil robot (who is?), so it works out nicely. She plays frightened well.And Kristanna Loken? What can I say? You can keep your Xenia Onatopp and your Mystique. There's a new femme fatale in town. And she's a toughie, too. She has a grenade launcher in her hand! Literally! She can throw ARNIE around the room like a RAGDOLL! How can you beat that? The T-X is a clever combination of the solid T-101 (Arnie) and the liquid T-1000 (Robert Patrick). With boobs. Sheer genius.I went in expecting a lame action movie about an old man in leather. What I got was a surprisingly good (REALLY good) Terminator movie, that left me wanting a T4.Is it inevitable? The future will decide...",9,3,4,18 July 2003
The Dark Knight," Best. Comic. Movie. EVER.
","I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together  movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new  insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in  his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an  honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting  perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be  viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN'  MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would  be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is  usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not  actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical  musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over  in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants  to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical  pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to  do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the  viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of  big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff  going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and  there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is  brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first  two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down  to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val  Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and  committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us  feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose  it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and  thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar?  Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get  one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died?  But...well...how can I put it...?   It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero,  but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just  looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you  need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first  one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more  emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was  necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with  Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such  garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She  rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to  say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you  get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics.  Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath  and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular  talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed  entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and  action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin),  but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.",10,928,1388,16 July 2008
Casino Royale," Now THAT'S James Bond!
","Casino Royale is like a minty-fresh mouthwash, eradicating the vile taste of that CG puke-fest known as Die Another Day. I literally felt CLEANSED after seeing it. I'd gotten so used to the same old same old that I had ceased to think something like this could happen. Mike and Barb - with an assist from Purvis/Wade, Haggis, Campbell and DC - have given Jimbo a long-overdue spring cleaning - made him more real, more relevant, and ultimately more INTERESTING.I really liked Brosnan's Bond  at the time. I think it was the hair. With GoldenEye, the Bond 'do' definitely reached its peak. Pierce was good in the part, too - convincing as a heavily Rodge-influenced (but slightly darker, more athletic) 007, spouting unfunny Bruce Fierstein-penned quips about frequent-flier mileage. Certainly, he seemed equally adept at coming to grips with a Kalashnikov, a Smirnoff or a Scorupco, but it is now clear (given fresh perspective) that by the end of his tenure both Pierce and the EON crew had LOST their grip on the character of JAMES BOND, as conceived by Ian Fleming.DC has OPENED MY EYES. Sure, he has taken the Bond 'do' to a disappointing low (the flaxen hue doesn't bother me so much  it's just a bit scruffy), but the character has been roused from his torpor, woken from his coma, resurrected from the dead - a bit like his literal 'resurrection' in a scene from this movie. Given the new toned-down realism, the handy in-car defibrillator seems a tad convenient (and therefore unrealistic), but at least he's able to FIND HIS CAR this time. Imagine if a drugged, cardiac-arresting Brosnan-Bond had staggered out of Gustav Graves' ice palace, looking for the one thing that could save his life...'Now, where the bloody hell did I PARK that thing? DAMN YOU, Q-BRANCH! LIGHT-EMITTING POLYMER MY TWITCHING, BLOODSHOT EYE!' DC's Jimbo has a real 'no bulls--t' vibe to him, which is one of the major differences between him and Pierce. He isn't worried about rumpling his absurdly well-tailored clothes. If you prick him (or punch, shoot or stab him) he bleeds, and wears the marks for longer than one scene. His knuckles are scabby. His face is scratched. If Pierce's Bond was a prize poodle, DC's is a fighting pit bull in comparison.But it's not only DC's acting skill and grasp of the character that make this movie great. It helps that they've got Fleming back as a foundation - which, considering how unlike any of the recent movies this is, only goes to show how far from Fleming's creation the films had strayed.I do not lament the loss of Dr. Evil-style lairs or idiotic gadgets or one-note henchmen or stupid Bond-girl names......or TERRIBLE clunking puns! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE a good pun. A well-considered and subtle play on words really gets me going. But after forty years' worth of increasingly insipid wordplay, it's refreshing that the writers this time resisted the urge to try and squeeze the unlikeliest of lines from the least conducive of situations. Sure, it's disorienting at first, so accustomed are we to the dodgy one-liner as a fundamental law of the Bondiverse. Upon my first viewing I sensed awkward gaps after murders and close calls, the only sounds being the chirping of crickets and the expectant intake of breath from an audience bracing itself for something lame. But it never came. Wonderful.Eva Green is a fantastic actor, and the script actually allows her to give a performance worthy of her talent. Let's face it, even the more accomplished Bond-girl actresses have come off looking a little superficial in the past (eg. Dame Diana, Carole Bouquet, Halle B). But Vesper is given a depth almost equal to that of Bond - and their relationship is more compelling for it. And it doesn't hurt that Eva is one of the most aesthetically-pleasing life forms ever to exist in this or any parallel universe.Mads brings depth and humanity to the blood-weeping, asthmatic Le Chiffre. Yes, Bond Villains can be realistic AND have cheesy gimmicks. Jeffrey Wright is excellent - but criminally underused - as Felix. I hope he's here to stay awhile (which would be another trend-breaker). Caterina Murino: Yum.Judi Dench: Scary - but it's her best M performance yet.David Arnold's score is far less ostentatious than his previous efforts. His restraint with the Theme is very clever and far more sensible than I thought he could be.You Know My Name: best theme song since Live 'n' Let Die.Chris Cornell: cooler than Wings.The action scenes are all superb - you can almost smell the blood and sweat. Sebastien Foucan is a superhuman freak.The title sequence is fantastic. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's the best yet, despite the absence of naked female silhouettes. But who needs naked female silhouettes when you've got Eva wearing......THAT DRESS. I damn-near wept blood MYSELF when I saw her in that thing! Discipline, 007...What more can I say? I LOVE this flick. Is it my favourite? It's too soon to tell - but it makes Pierce's movies look like Rodge's movies, and Rodge's movies look like - like - Peter Sellers' Casino Royale! Bond has begun, and I can't wait to see where he goes next.",10,4,8,7 December 2006
Sin City," Makes Tank Girl look like a bad film.
","Comic books (or graphic novels, or whatever you want to call them) don't particularly interest me. Never have. It's not that I necessarily dislike them, I've just never felt the urge to shell out money for them. I'd much rather watch movies. Strangely though, I seem to really love movies BASED on comic books. Particularly the recent ones. Spider-Man 1 & 2. X-Men 1 & 2. Batman Begins. Hulk. I even like that rubbish Tank Girl movie, mostly because of Ice-T's brilliant turn as an ex-cop-turned-kangaroo-mutant. It is the absolute BEST portrayal of an ex-cop-turned-kangaroo-mutant you will EVER see on film. Lori Petty wasn't bad, either.But none of them come close to matching Sin City for sheer movie badness (meant in a positive way, like the way the hip kids say it. Actually, 'sickness' is probably a more appropriate term). This is a grand day in the history of film-making. It is without a doubt the BEST movie Mickey Rourke has EVER been in. And Brittany Murphy, for that matter. It's really, REALLY good. Just don't let the kids see it, and don't watch it with your Mum. Trust me, I speak from experience. My Mum likes NICE movies. And this one's anything but.As implied above, I had no prior knowledge of Frank Miller's books. I'm sure they're great, and, from what I've heard, the movie's style is very true to them. But, with respect, that means little to me. I'm just looking at Sin City as a movie. And a damn fine one it is.First of all, the visual style of the film is breathtaking. But there's been enough said about that already, and I can't really add anything new, except that I dug Dwight's red shoes. Yay red shoes!The dialogue is brilliantly corny. It's original, but phrased in that old-fashioned, clichéd, b-grade film-noir way. And it sounds great, particularly when coming from the mouths of such talented actors. Even the above-mentioned Mr. Rourke and Ms. Murphy - who I usually wouldn't touch with the narrow end of a broom while wearing a radiation suit - are superb in their roles. In fact, Marv is the best character in the film, and Rourke's portrayal stands out above the stellar ensemble surrounding him. The other two 'leading men' - Clive Owen's Dwight and Bruce Willis's Hartigan - are also very good, but lack Marv's beautiful, brutal simplicity. Plus their chins are nowhere near as big, and their coats nowhere near as fine-lookin'.I was impressed by EVERYONE's performance, even those from actors who no longer impress me, due to the fact that they always impress me (Don't worry, I know what I mean). I'm not going to go into WHY everyone was so good, as there were so many actors who were so good in so many different ways. From A-for-Alba to Z-for- um - Wood, I loved 'em all.Elijah Wood as the CREEPIEST villain in recent movie history? Didn't see THAT coming! And was that REALLY Carla Gugino? I'll never look at Spy Kids the same way again, that's for DAMN sure! Zoinks! Robert Rodriguez, you film-making pioneer, you. You DEADSET LEGEND you! I used to think Once Upon a Time in Mexico was your masterpiece. How incredibly silly I now feel.What more can I say? Nothing really, except......give me sequel! NOW!",10,1,2,14 July 2005
