","One of the contenders for the 2020 Oscars is a sympathetic film by the acclaimed director James Mangold about car racing, and which, important to note, fortunately has nothing to do with the 'Fast and Fury' series.The title of the film was changed to 'Le Mans 66' in most countries where it is shown outside the US, although the original name is more appropriate, because the historical facts in the film have been adjusted and amplified, in order to highlight as much as possible the rivalry between two large factories, different in every sense, and first of all in terms of conceptions and philosophies in general, when it comes to cars and the automobile industry.
Either way, both titles are certainly better than the original 'Go Like Hell' when Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt were reportedly considered for potential lead roles.
This is how we get a very watchable movie, with excellent chemistry between the main actors, Matt Damon and Christian Bale, that, once it starts, can easily be turn a blind eye for all its imperfections.There is no need to waste words on the details, the movie is simply fun and recommended for viewing. Wishing only that other films seen in competition for this year's Film Academy Awards are more like that.",8,1,1,14 January 2020

","I thought I was not in the habit of commenting on movies I didn't like, because it's nicer to talk about what we like instead. But since there is no major Oscar-nominated performance this year (except of course the 'Joker', which should be discussed somewhere else), and undeserved praise comes for really bad examples of movies that should not be watched, I decided to look back at the following title, from the director Sam Mendes, whose other films left me indifferent.Please note that the commentary will consist mainly of spoilers, because there is nothing else to comment on. The only praise for this movie is the truly impressive long shots, which could be considered a masterpiece, if only they were better integrated with rather poor CGI effects, and served a basic story, that is pure clichÃ©, and nothing more than that.There is no comment on acting because there is no any reason for that. Benedict Cumberbatch and Collin Firth appear too briefly in the film to make any contribution to the plot, leaving only the wooden appearances of the other actors, in all either dull, or impossible situations. From the very beginning, the two main characters stand out from their surroundings, as they just exit from the beauty salon, unlike the other characters with faces and clothes dirty, as the soldiers should be. They are given an impossible task, which seem only they can accomplish. One dies in an attempt to rescue an enemy pilot without any logic. From that moment on, every step is predictable to the end. The rest of the hero arrives to meet even a female person who, apart from mere appearance, is of no relevance to the story. At crucial moments, he even leaves the weapon, so that by some miracle, avoiding all the bullets of the enemy, he will reach the target.The most irritating of all l'art pour l'artistic shots, that are too many in this movie, is when the long run in front of the trench is shown at the end, when the unfortunate hero runs and collides with soldiers who, like a miracle, constantly emerge from the same trench, in order to get to the command and stop this futile attack (it would seem, as futile as this movie is). It would have been easier if he had remained to run in an empty trench, since the attack had already begun, when only these soldiers would not constantly sprout from nowhere. Or, to run behind, instead of in front of the trench, because there is no one there, but in that case we would not have such a long and beautifully shot frame, would we?Unfortunately, this movie failed to be the anything else but the annoying attempt of an imitation of 'Saving Private Ryan,' portrayed in World War I. Why the title is exactly his year, and what does it have to do with the fictional event being described, remains a mystery.",4,1,5,16 January 2020

","Among movies that will be in the running for the Oscars 2020, the most interesting is the achievement of Korean director Bong Joon-Hu, not because of some special quality and originality, but because of the marked overestimation given to him by both lay audiences and from modern critics.Please note that the writer of these lines is not one of the experts of Korean films, nor was he ever interested in being one. On the other hand, Bong Joon-Hu became an international creator with his excellent Snowpiercer from 2013, so the criteria should be in line with that fact.The film is at first indisputably interesting to watch, drinkable, extraordinarily driven. It is placed between comedy, drama and thriller, intelligently refusing to classify itself, as well as engaging in a deeper understanding of social problems, avoiding to take sides with either of the two families portrayed in the film from the two ends of the social ladder, so that it cleverly made the culmination as interesting as possible.He will undoubtedly be awarded with some Oscars, except for acting, because there is no reason for that. But there is also no reason to emphasize the over-originality of the story itself, ie. screenplay, because the critics seem to have forgotten the masterpiece of the 1964 French director and screenwriter Rene Clement's 'Joy House' (aka 'The Cage of Love') with Alain Delon and Jane Fonda. The main thrust of Joon-Hu's film is taken from the title, with the motives and plot of the love affair being transferred to the social sphere, which of course is so modern today, but in that case it is somewhat hypocritical not to give a simultaneous and deeper analysis, for the sake of mere viewability and commercial reasons.Also, in addition to the many other banalities used in the plot, communicating with the Morse Code as presented in the film could also include it in science fiction genre.Since Hollywood has not been bothered by originality before (just remember the 'contribution' in directing of the 2015 award-winning plagiarism 'The Revenant'), there is no reason not to repeat the situation again this year.",5,5,28,14 January 2020
