Ford v Ferrari," Idc if you if you're not a car fan watch it!!
","I saw the good reviews for this one got curious finally checked it this is a great movie!! (And I'm not even a car guy) good story, pretty good characters you feel the race sequences!! Did take me a little while to know the characters at first and some scenes can drag but overall great surprise of a film for me worth watching in the theater ( watch in row 3 or 4 so closer for the racing scenes) it's a must see if you're car person and if not still recommend it you might like it like I did;)",9,4,7,1 December 2019
