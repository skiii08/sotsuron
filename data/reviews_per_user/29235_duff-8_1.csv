Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I'll take Chewy over Jar Jar any day!
","Sometimes I thought I was watching A bugs life, or Toy story with all the computer animation.  It was still a very good movie though.  I thought they could have told more about the most interesting character Darth Maul. Great light saber scene, and the racing scene was terrific, even though I thought I was playing a computer game during it.  One other thing that annoyed me was Jar Jar Binks, give me a break!",8,0,1,23 May 1999
