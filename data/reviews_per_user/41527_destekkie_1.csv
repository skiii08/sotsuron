Scarface," A top movie! The cubans at their best.
","this movie is beautifully written and greatly directed. Al Pacino's acting is also outstanding! i've watched it many times and the movie stills enjoys me.you've got to see this movie, you won't be disappointed, the script just sucks you up into the movie.Al Pacino plays Tony Montana: a gangster who begins as an immigrant with nothing on him. but with his big mouth and a lot of 'cajones', he works himself up into the drug business...just watch and enjoy!also play GTA vice city, this game is based on the movie.",10,0,1,19 November 2005
