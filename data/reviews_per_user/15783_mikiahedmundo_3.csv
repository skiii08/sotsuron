Blade Runner 2049," There is a menag a trois
","Involving a couple of flaunting babies, but otherwise this film is stupid. Do you remember the criticism of the prequel where Rachel and Deckard ride into the sunset on a glorious road amidst beautiful nature? Right. Here too you can live in opulance in a casino and drink free whiskey and even have your own cute dog, etc.
Snore. What can I tell you? Sequels.",3,108,182,6 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Only if you like chubby orientals
","And that is all.Give me a break. Bombs dropping in space. Yoda appearing and setting nature on fire (but in Star Wars we know after death the jedi cannot affect things like that...) and then some girls really trying to stalk some emo guy by video spamming him. I thought he is going to call his parents any second and tell on her. Dude, change your video privacy settings!",2,15,22,6 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," LAME
","Why should I watch it?? No pretty girls. no flaunting. no originality. no hope. no good acting. no reason. Mary Sue.
