Casablanca," One of the best!
","Time seems to date some movies badly, while it has worked greatly in favor of some movies, like Casablanca. It was made in the day when color was rare, yet, used black and white so well that it seems to be a great example of a movie that should have been filmed in black and white, even if doing such were to have cost more than color. Casablanca is a real classic. It's the sort of movie that feels like an experience and makes you glad you've seen it. It was all so excellent that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who loves movies. When you see some of these scenes for yourself you immediately understand how they've had such a lasting influence to this day. For the leading characters, their relationship meant hope, which was exactly what was needed throughout the bleak time that was World War II. Every character leaves an indelible mark even though all it did in the movie was hit a few guitar strings or pick pocket at a restaurant. Every scene in the movie is a study in itself. Casablanca without doubt makes its way in my all time top 5 list!",10,0,1,11 May 2015
Chinatown," Great noir film
","This movie is a great noir. From muted colors to shaded performances to an uncompromised ending, the movie's a worthy successor to the 40's classics. And that's despite the 130-minute length, twice the average. Plus, director Polanski doesn't have to meet Code requirements that compromised many 40's films. We get an ending that benefits the general storyline, no matter how much of a downer it is for the audience. The movie's a first-rate noir that makes a lasting impression. The story line was brilliant, it kept you on the edge of your seat the whole entire time. The cinematography was so well done, the use of lighting and camera angles had this awesome effect that drew you in and set the tone for every scene. The acting was marvelous too, Dunaway and Nicholson were brilliant together and had an edgy feel that kept a mysterious and hidden evil to both of them that kept the viewer questioning at all times. They also had awesome chemistry that made them so convincing together! Over all I loved this film and would recommend it.",9,0,1,12 May 2015
Annie Hall," Serious comedy
","I enjoyed this movie. It was quirky, funny and an overall great story about a dysfunctional couple who can't seem to stay away from each other. I thought that both Annie and Alvy's awkwardness was hilarious and in all honesty I thought they made a perfect couple. The film opens with a mildly devastating thought about life, however it fits with the tone film wonderfully. Allen really captures the essence of life and love with every line that's written. The film stands on its own two feet so well because it's a mature and realistic. He uses animation, subtitles (which tells us what they are thinking, instead of saying (a very funny scene), cross overs, flash backs and he even talks to us. Asking us our opinion and making us feel like we are really there. This formula for a romantic comedy is one that works, and can actually relate to the audience, instead of being fake and giving the audience silly ideas of what a relationship is like. Overall it was an enjoyable film with laugh out loud comedy.",7,0,0,11 May 2015
The Graduate," One of my favorites
","The Graduate was an interesting film to watch. I thought it was great in many aspects. Each scene is so perfectly crafted to evoke a variety of emotions, from anxiety to outrageous laughter to tenderness, etc. Dustin Hoffman did a great job acting, as well as Anne Bancroft. She had a way of being there even when she wasn't on screen. The main theme in The Graduate is that of a character who is confused about their life and future, while being pressured by an older generation. Ben feels like he is 'drowning' because he is confused about his future and is constantly being pressured by his parents. This film speaks to the younger generation; informing them of the dangers of not turning into the person they want to be, but instead, turning into what others want them to be. Even today, The Graduate is very appropriate and its theme is applicable. The story easily attracts today's viewers since at one time or another we all have questioned where our lives were heading. The Simon and Garfunkel songs which provide the soundtrack are a terrific addition to the film as they fit in perfectly with what is happening on the screen. This film was clever and very well made.",10,0,0,16 April 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Not a fan of musicals, but this was great
","'Singin' in the Rain' has been mentioned as an all-time favorite musical by many and I can totally see why. It is such a delightfully hilarious film. The excellent and superb camera and lighting effects, as well as the constant activity leave you absolutely no time to be bored. The story outline revolves around the switch from silent movies to talkies and how a film crew, namely the stars and the producers attempt to create a talking movie but there is one problem, the leading lady can't sing and she can't act. Jean Hagen provides us with the funniest, most hilarious moments in her way-over-the-top performance of the dumb film star with the appalling accent. There are not surprisingly a lot of musical numbers, which are generally well-made. Especially good is the title number as sung by Gene Kelly while meandering through a street. The only number that seemed out of place was the extended 'Broadway Melody' number toward the end of the film, which looks nice, but is disruptive to the flow of the story. All and all this film was great and is a must for any fan of musicals, or movies period!",8,0,1,11 May 2015
Psycho," Classic Thriller!
","I am a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock. Every movie that I've seen by him has been excellent. This one, however, is my favorite. Psycho is brilliant. Hitchcock gave this film excellent direction, and the acting was fantastic. Hitchcock builds the tension and constantly keeps you on your toes. His use of camera angles is superb. This, all while keeping the movie moving along at a brisk pace. At no stage does it drift, or get bogged down. It's the shower scene that is most talked about in this film, I believe there are couple or more scenes that are under rated yet very impactful. I was terrified by the climax shot where the mother is shown, more than anything else. I recommend this film to everyone. It's full of twists, turns and surprises that keep you guessing write till the end, and I mean the very end. You can't take your eyes of the screen. You're engrossed by these characters and the plot that you don't want to miss a second.",10,1,2,11 May 2015
Rosemary's Baby," Horror film without all the special effects
","Certainly one of the best horror/suspense films ever made. It is a chilling psycho-drama, a social commentary, and a good old-fashioned horror yarn all at once. It's difficult to break it all down, because there is so much that contributes to the sheer fear this movie gives off. The story takes a little while to get going, but once we're into Rosemary's pregnancy the stakes begin to rise and suspense is unrelenting. This movie is an example of the horror genre done right; there are spine-chilling moments, satanic images and horror themes that will stay with you forever. The editing in these parts is very impressive as well, creating visual illusions without special effects. The important thing to pay attention to is how Rosemary's freaked-out state of mind, combined with the creepy influence of the brownstone, plays an important part in the goings-on around her. Especially when people start dying, from the nice girl from across the hall she meets who 'commits suicide', to the sudden illness and demise of family friend, Hutch. Oh, and to top it all off is one of the most chilling sequences in horror, when she does get pregnant...but there's a really good chance that Guy's not the father. The performances are excellent. Polanski did not go for cheap scares. In this case you could enjoy the movie much more than you could enjoy the cheap bloody scary movies.",9,1,3,12 May 2015
