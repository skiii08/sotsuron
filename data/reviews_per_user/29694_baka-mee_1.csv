10 Cloverfield Lane," Oka~y ....
",first thing first ... i really don't know how this movie is a 7 ..OK its a good movie and good acting and everything .. but the story haven't built right .. the director wanted to do a twist so badly that he missed up everything at first you'll like the movie a lot .. oh and btw they really need to change the movie description here its so wrong i wont say any spoilers ... just ask a friend who watched it don't trust the rating on this onei think it worth a 5 stars max.,4,1,3,10 August 2017
