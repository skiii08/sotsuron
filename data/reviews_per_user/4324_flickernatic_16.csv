Ford v Ferrari," Above average motor racing drama
","Enthusiasm for this movie will no doubt vary according to your interest in motor racing and the cars and drivers that make it. If, like myself, the sound of a 4.7 litre V8 on full song is akin to Beethoven's 5th, you will not be disappointed. Otherwise there is still much to be enjoyed here.The story revolves around Ford Motor Company's ambition in the 1960s to build a legendary racing car (the GT 40) capable of beating the venerable Ferrari team in Europe at the Le Mans 24-hour race. Loosely based on the real events, the thrills of speed, brilliantly portrayed in some superb racing footage, are complemented by the human drama as the racing team struggle with the monstrous Henry Ford 2 (superbly played by Tracy Letts) and his cronies and their own personal relationships. Matt Damon and Christian Bale make a great contrasting pair as all-American racing maestro, Carol Shelby, and cantankerous British racing ace and master engineer, Ken Miles, with tremendous performances from both. The strains of top-flight motor racing are excellently depicted via Miles' relationship with his supportive wife, Mollie (Catriona Balfe) and adoring son, Peter (beautifully played by Noah Jupe).Everything proceeds at a cracking pace and, unlike some car movies, the visuals are not overburdened with flash-and-crash CGI intrusions. A few cliched moments do not detract too much from the excitement and, at times, poignancy, of this highly enjoyable film.

The King's Speech," The King Speaks Loud and Clear
","At last! - a movie that one can unashamedly applaud. Superficially, this is a historical drama about the Abdication Crisis and its effects on the Royal Family of the day. What it is really about,or, if you prefer, at a deeper level, it is the story of one person's struggle to conquer the inadequacies of their upbringing and confront their deepest fears. It is also a film about commitment, loyalty and friendship - and their opposites.The acting is high quality throughout, though Timothy Spall as Churchill is stretching the casting somewhat. But he and Elizabeth Bonham Carter, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce are very much in supporting roles. It is Colin Firth, as George VI, and Geoffrey Rush, as Lionel Logue, the speech therapist, who carry the film. The acting is superb from both, but it is Rush who is utterly outstanding.You may need to be English to fully appreciate the nuances of this movie (e.g. the manner of the Queen's deft side-stepping of Logue's wife's invitation to stay for dinner). But anyone with a little life experience can identify with the predicament of being in a demanding situation not of one's choosing and through no fault of one's own - except that in the King's case, there was nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. A great and moving example of 'grace under pressure'.",9,0,1,11 February 2011
First Man," This Right Stuff is Out of this World!
","There can hardly have been a more dramatic adventure since the Age of Exploration than the 1960s U.S. mission to send 'a Man to the Moon'. Neil Armstrong was that first man, and the story of his preparations for this venture and subsequent success are told here to great effect. This movie is both exciting and poignant, weaving together the astronauts' professional and personal lives, revealing the enormous mental, physical and emotional pressures and tensions exerted not just on Armstrong and his colleagues, but also their families; the ever-present risk of death hangs over the mission as the astronauts prepare and compete to be the First Man. A story like this hardly needs dramatisation - it is itself amazing - and the understated approach adopted by Damien Chazelle works very effectively. Although in danger of lapsing into sentimentality now and then, generally the movie avoids the schmaltz traps. This makes the emotional impact of the story all the more powerful, epitomised by the way the ending has been treated. The performances are generally good, though perhaps not outstanding, and the cinematography and FX are quite brilliant. CGI excesses and bogus sci-fi scenarios have been avoided, putting this film in a league well above, for example, The Martian.At 2hrs 21mins, this is a lengthy film. But I found it so engaging - you train with the astronauts, travel with them, land on the Moon with them, and feel every rattle and groan along the way - that it did not feel excessively long. And in its portrayal of the massive forces required to carry humans beyond the grip of Earth's gravity, and of the phenomenal courage of those space pioneers who subjected themselves to those forces, it has done justice to the magnitude of their achievement.Not to be missed!(Viewed at Odeon, Warrington, U.K. 15 October 2018)",9,0,1,16 October 2018
The Notebook," Titanic minus the icebergs - drowning in its own slush!
","One of the many problems with this movie is the implausibility and predictability of the story (maybe that's two of the many problems!). Girl takes up with guy from the wrong side of the tracks. They are separated by her parents and by war; she takes up with a worthy suitor; but she eventually returns to his arms. Kind of Titanic minus the ship, the icebergs and most of what made that movie so good. They live happily ever after until she winds up with dementia in the Arnold Schwarzenneger Home for Retired Very Wealthy Californian Gentlefolk and forgets everything, including him. He jogs her intermittently back into the present by reading from a mysterious book which is (hey, we would never have guessed that!) their story. They dance, just like they used to, and indulge in heart-shredding exchanges of the 'I will always lurve you' variety. There is a point about 10 minutes from the end when you think (with relief) that the movie is over. It certainly would have been a good place to stop; there's nothing more to add to the story. But no. The director has to go on and rub in the schmaltz just in case we thought the movie might display some subtlety. The guy wangles his way past the night attendant at the Home and into his demented partner's bed where they expire together. A perfect ending - for them, perhaps, but not for us. Not a movie for grownups. Don't waste your money.",2,11,18,11 August 2008
The Danish Girl," Cold as a Copenhagen winter
","Set in Copenhagen in the mid-1920s, this film tells the story of the first person to undergo gender reassignment surgery, a story which does not, sadly, have a happy ending. Einar Wegener, a Danish painter, has been married to a fellow-artist, Gerda for six years. Gradually he becomes obsessed with the idea of becoming a woman, a quest which leads him to submit to untried medical procedures which eventually prove fatal.It does not take much imagination to appreciate how challenging it must be to find oneself stuck in the 'wrong' body and impelled to rectify this situation by resort to surgery. Perils loom on all sides - the physical risks, the psychological anguish, the threats to personal relationships, the fear of social ostracism or worse - and smooth passage seems improbable. How much more so given the state of medical and psychological knowledge in the 1920s and a less liberal moral climate than prevails today. Surely such a prospect must make for rich and vibrant drama. Yet, despite its dramatic potential, the Wegeners' story is given such a flat treatment by Tom Hooper that the movie verges on boring at times.A bleak note is struck from the start and continued with little respite. The mood is cold and gloomy, emphasised by the colourless, sparely-furnished interiors (light-grey walls in their apartment, harsh white wall tiles in the clinics and consulting rooms - only when Gerda visits Paris do we see some gorgeous period interiors), the bare wintry landscapes of Copenhagen, and the minor-key music. The tempo is one-paced and the dialogue is often stilted and dreary. Can this really be someone engaged in a momentous struggle with their identity and, consequently, with their personal relationships and their position in society? Indeed, when Einar first steps out into the world as Lili, she seems barely noticed by those around her despite looking far from convincing as a female.Einar and Gerda never explore with each other in any sustained way what is happening to him and its implications for their relationship. Partly because of this we get little understanding of Einar's self-perception, little sense of his insights into his condition. Similarly, we don't encounter the desperation of someone in crisis except very late on when Einar is battling with the immediate after-effects of his operations. Mercifully, we are spared visual details of his exposure to the surgeon's scalpel.The lead characters are surprisingly one-dimensional and seem to be narrowly self-obsessed. The emotional range is equally constrained for while we witness neediness, longing and lust, there is no real passion, no sense of warm affection or love between Gerda and her husband. Nor do we see real anger displayed, despite there being much for the characters to be angry about. Lili's quest for transformation seems to bring no one any lasting pleasure.The exaggerated and awkward manner that Eddie Redmayne brought to the character of Stephen Hawking, and which worked brilliantly there, does not really do so here. Instead it proves a distraction. Lili repeatedly responds to male attention with little more than shy downward glances and simpering expressions which become rather embarrassing to watch. Perhaps only a more accomplished actor than Redmayne could carry off this highly demanding role successfully. Alicia Vikander does much better as Gerda but cannot shine so brightly in Redmayne's shadow.There is clearly plenty of talent associated with this film and the story of the Wegeners seems worth telling. But this movie fails to hit the mark.Viewed at Home (successor to The Cornerhouse), Manchester, UK, 03.01.16.",5,53,77,4 January 2016
Life of Pi," Unusual and Enthralling!
","I had not read the book and so came to this movie without preconceptions. We saw it in 3D and there are many visually stunning moments that really work in this format. One marvels at the technical ingenuity of the film-makers and the imagination of the story's author. Superb acting from Suraj Sharma, as the adult Pi, who must have spent an awful lot of his time during the making of this film soaking wet!The movie would have attracted a higher rating from me but for a few failings. It was too long and could have been shortened to good effect; the plot is not as tightly constructed as it could have been; and the ending is something of an anti-climax. After all the drama and visual fireworks that precede them, the closing scenes verge on the dull, which is a great shame as there is much that is brilliant here.It must have been a great challenge translating this tale from the book page to the cinema screen. The result has certainly produced a unique and very enjoyable viewing experience.(Viewed at The Cornerhouse, Manchester, UK, 13.01.13)",7,0,1,21 January 2013
The Revenant," Revenge and survival in a savage world: gory but gripping!
","The story of The Revenant is pretty straightforward. A frontiersman, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is acting as guide to a group of fur-trappers, is attacked and seriously injured by a bear. The group's leader, Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), decides to leave Glass to either recover or die while the rest of the party continue their journey to a distant outpost.Glass is left in the care of a cynical trapper, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), an inexperienced youngster, Jim, and Glass's own half-breed son, Hawk. After the main party's departure, Fitzgerald decides to finish Glass off but Hawk tries to stop him. In the ensuing struggle Hawk is killed. Fitzgerald then persuades Jim that Glass is dying and that they must abandon him for fear of Indian attack. They leave and eventually reach the outpost where they are reunited with Henry, telling him - untruthfully - they left after Glass had died.Unbeknown to them, Glass gradually recovers from his terrible wounds and embarks on his quest for revenge on those who murdered his son and left Glass himself to die. Glass has become the 'revenant', one who 'returns from the dead.' Set in the early 19th century amid the rivers and mountains of a wintry Montana, this tale of wrongs and revenge is fairly straightforward. But it is as much a story of survival in a brutal world in which violent death is a familiar prospect for human and animal alike. Hence we witness several graphically depicted scenes of bloody violence, the bear attack being one of the most gruesome and terrifyingly convincing. Here nature is 'red in tooth and claw', the spectre of Jack London (The Call of the Wild, To Build a Fire, etc.) hanging over the entire proceedings.What lifts this movie out of the ordinary is Emmanuel Lubezki's superb cinematography which draws us into every scene. The mountain landscape in all its bleak wintry majesty resonates perfectly with the kill-or-die ethos of the living creatures that struggle to live there. Yet the story is laced with moments of spirituality and hints of transcendence; Glass has visions of his dead wife and lingering skyward shots of silent towering trees point us to whatever - if anything - that lies above and beyond.If you look too closely at this tale you see that Glass is an improbably durable man, surviving what in reality would be impossible circumstances. But so spell-binding is the combined effects of the visuals, the music and the acting that we willingly suspend our disbelief, at least until we emerge from the movie theatre and return to the reality of daily life.Leonardo DiCaprio is little short of magnificent as Glass, ably supported by Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson. Both DiCaprio and the director, Alejandro Inarritu, look well-deserving of awards for this stunningly atmospheric movie. Recommended - but be prepared for blood and guts!

Mamma Mia!," A great musical experience for tone deaf karaoke lovers
","After so much hype, and having seen the stage show which was brilliant, I was hoping for something special from this movie. How wrong of me! It is a disaster - not because it is a flawed creation but because it has taken a superb piece of artistry and wrecked it, wonderful songs reduced to cinematic karaoke. Surely it would occur to the makers of a musical that the most fundamental requirement of it is that it should be musical! But no. All too obviously the producers have gone for the star names, presumably hoping that the audience will know and like them while being too young to have seen ABBA at work for real. It's all so embarrassing: Meryl Streep, looking like a demented retiree who has escaped by dressing up as Andy Pandy; Julie Walters, whose talent is totally wasted here; Pierce Brosnan, whose hairy chest cannot make up in my mind for his appalling 'singing',-it's too depressing to go on. Amanda Seyfried seemed to me to be the only actor who came out with any credit. The story is thin, but that's fine insofar as it is merely a scaffolding on which to hang ABBA's music and wonderful lyrics. But their legacy is trashed, most painfully when Streep tries to sing 'The Winner Takes It All', one of ABBA's most moving songs. The thought that this movie has made so much money is dispiriting to say the least. Benny and Bjorn were wary of letting this project go forward. They should have followed their gut instincts.",1,7,12,27 January 2009
The Theory of Everything," Brilliantly realised story of triumph over adversity
","I approached this film knowing something of Stephen Hawking's life and work but with no real interest in watching a full-length movie about it. But I'm glad I did see this wonderful film. For his deeply-moving story is a revelation, exquisitely realised by Eddie Redmayne, as Hawking, and Felicity Jones, as his wife, Jane, under the direction of James Marsh.Here is this amazingly bright young man on the verge of a brilliant academic career as a cosmologist. He falls in love with a beautiful, intelligent girl and she with him. Their life is set on course for a glittering future when he is struck down by a tragedy of Beethoven-like proportions - a man who may well be about to produce the 'theory of everything', the holy grail of physics, is diagnosed with an incurable terminal disease and is given but a short time to live.And yet somehow, against all predictions, he does not die. Not only that, he manages to fulfil and exceed all expectations, both professionally and personally. He writes books, he wins prizes and accolades, he fathers a family. With the loving support of his wife, Jane, he becomes truly The Man Who Refused to Die. But even then there is still a heavy price to pay ...It is no surprise to see that Redmayne won an Oscar for his performance here. His portrayal of Stephen Hawking's gradual faltering collapse is totally convincing, as is Felicity Jones's depiction of Jane Hawking as the exuberance, optimism and energy of youth are eroded away as the years pass and the sheer strain of keeping her husband and family functioning leaves its mark. How cruel life can be!But there is nothing mawkish about this film. It looks unflinchingly at the sadness and the joys, the successes and the failures, the beginnings and the endings. Highly recommended.(Vieweed at the Warrington Odeon, UK, 11th January 2015)",10,0,0,25 February 2015
Lincoln," Good in parts but a disappointing History-according-to-Hollywood.
","Although titled 'Lincoln' this Spielberg movie is not a biopic but the story of the passing of the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery. In so far as it focuses on the culmination of Lincoln's life and political career it might indeed be said to be hagiography, a piece of hero- worship which presumably will have more appeal to American patriots than to others. We actually learn very little about Lincoln's background , early life and rise to power, which is a pity as they make a fascinating story in themselves.Visually it is an absorbing film, replete with period detail and atmosphere, and Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of the beleaguered President is stunning (although his accent reminded me of Walter Brennan's 'Stumpy' in Rio Bravo, an incongruous comparison). But for me the man who steals the show is Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, the rabble rousing leader of the Radicals, whose performance is ever watchable.Although there are a few battlefield scenes and glimpses of Lincoln's family life, the movie revolves around the debates on the Amendment on the floor of the House of Representatives. I was struck by the resemblance to those court-room dramas beloved of Americans, punctuated by cries of 'Objection!' and 'Clear the court!' 'Lincoln' could, perhaps, be seen as a scaled-up courtroom drama, with Lincoln the man on trial and the congressmen the jury. A noticeable weakness in the dramatic structure, however, is that the 'accused' himself never appears in the 'courtroom' (presumably that would be un-Constitutional) so that the 'trial' is conducted through intermediaries. Dramatic tension is further weakened because we already know the outcome - the Amendment is passed, slavery is abolished, the War is ended.Many of the interchanges between congressmen, although passionate, are perhaps overly-long and complex unless you are a keen student of American history. On that point, there are several scenes which would presumably resonate much more strongly with a US audience (e.g. the surrender at Appomattox) than they did with myself. It also did not seem clear quite why abolishing slavery and ending the war were in direct conflict with each other, the raison-d'etre of Lincoln's personal and political dilemma. The movie's ending is baffling. We all know that Lincoln was assassinated by a gunman while watching a theatre performance. Fine. We see a theatre performance and expect to witness the ghastly deed. But no - the central character is absent once more. A man rushes onto the stage to announce that 'The President has been shot!' Where? We're in the theatre but we didn't see it! What's going on? Did I miss something? Cut to scene of Lincoln on a bed, being pronounced dead by a physician. Seems we were in some other theatre where his young son is in the audience so that we can witness his pain on hearing that his father is dead. We've been fooled but not in a good way.The movie is not without clichés - swelling music as the Amendment is passed, some rather self-absorbed story-telling by Lincoln, slightly sycophantic admiration from the younger generation, and a kind of beyond-the-grave finale. It's all a strange mixture.Not one of Spielberg's best movies but some patience and a little preparation on the historical background may enhance enjoyment. Even so, still worth a look.(Viewd at the Odeon, Westbrook, Warrington, UK 04.02.13)",6,0,1,5 February 2013
Cold War," Warm Hearts in Cold Times
","This love story is set in the years shortly after the end of the Second World War when Poland, having struggled to free itself from Nazi tyranny, then finds itself subjected to Stalinist occupation. This cruel, repressive situation provides the setting in which the lovers struggle to build their futures - the key to understanding the drama. A middle-aged musician, Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), under the direction of Stalinist quislings, is on a mission to find the talent for the creation of a Polish folk ensemble, destined for use as a propaganda tool by the Soviets.In the course of his search, he meets and falls in love with a beautiful young singer, Zula (Joanna Kulig). Aware of the growing constraints being placed upon him and his artistic integrity by the sickly officialdom of the State, he plans to escape to Berlin, and asks her to go with him. She agrees. But Wiktor soon discovers that such a move is more than she feels can cope with, and she remains in Poland.Wiktor moves on to Paris where he becomes involved in the jazz scene and with another woman. A few years later, during a tour by the folk ensemble to European cities, Wiktor and Zula meet again. She is now married to one of the odious Polish State officials, an act of convenience/necessity rather than love, just as Wiktor's new relationship is. They try to go their separate ways, but their initial passionate attraction returns and they rekindle their affair . . . with tragic consequences. The yearning for the Homeland is strong and the lovers return to Poland. Their fraught relationship, with its dream of personal and artistic fulfilment and freedom, flickers and flares, warms and burns until at last, the lovers confront the impossibility of their dream ever being realised under the stifling presence of the Stalinist regime.Wearied by existing in such a world, they decide to take their own lives. This superb movie, wonderfully shot in monochrome in a boxy frame, combines utterly convincing acting by the leads with evocative and brilliantly performed music, creating a chillingly bleak mood. Sentimentality is absent, the lovers being portrayed as hardened and flawed as well as tender and torn. There is no hint of melodrama, more of weary inevitability. The final scene is handled with such tragic delicacy that I, for one, was left speechless with grief as I left the movie theatre. A brilliant tour de force with an emotional punch that stays with you long after the movie is over.(Viewed at HOME Arts Centre, Cinema 1, Manchester, UK 9 September 2018)",9,4,12,16 October 2018
Avatar," Entertaining but unsatisfying
","Normally this (sci-fi)would not be my kind of movie (leaving aside 2001: A Space Odyssey, but then Kubrick was a brilliant director). But the hype worked and I felt I had to see it.The 3D imagery and the CG effects are, indeed, very impressive. The plot, however, is much less so and seems to be a familiar story seen before in the Wild West and elsewhere: noble native people ruthlessly exploited by technically sophisticated invaders, one of whom falls in love with a fair native maiden and helps the beleaguered savages to defeat - temporarily, perhaps - their tormentors. It all seems, well, a bit trite.The movie is, however, entertaining. There's plenty of action - in fact rather too many battle scenes for me - and there's always anticipation of some even more magnificent visual display to come.But guess what? We're supposed to be in the year 2154. Within minutes we see one of the main characters, Dr Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) ostentatiously smoking a good old-fashioned 20th century cigarette! How much did the tobacco corporations pay to achieve that piece of product placement? What are they trying to do? Convince today's kids that smoking will never die (even if they might as a consequence)? Probably 'yes'.That turned me off big-time.So, worth seeing but more for appearances than meanings.",5,3,7,20 January 2010
Les Misérables," Les Miserables - c'est formidable!
","I am not a great enthusiast for 'musicals' but having seen and enjoyed the stage production of Les Mis way back when, we decided to give the movie a try. I'm glad we did. The film starts with a bang as the camera swoops into a French naval shipyard where bedraggled convict labourers struggle to haul a huge galleon into dry dock. From there on the action moves at a brisk pace as the story of love and liberty unfolds over the next two-and-a-half hours of visual excitement and stirring songs.The performances are uniformly excellent with Hugh Jackman, in the lead role of Jean Valjean, outstanding. Some critics have disliked the singing, but I thought it was always adequate and sometimes superb, a considerable achievement given that there was no studio recording or dubbing. Certainly the singing is vastly better than the awful efforts from Brosnan and Streep in Mamma Mia! That these are not operatic performances added to the reality of the story for me. However, the 'sung speech' became a little monotonous in parts, where everything seemed to be sung in five- or six-word phrases. Even so, an exceptional movie, well worth seeing - my wife detests musicals but she loved Les Miserables! (Viewed at The Cornerhouse, Manchester, UK 20.01.13)",8,4,7,21 January 2013
Marriage Story," Divorce Story LA style - A ghastly spectacle!
","Movies about people who make movies are always suspect for their tendency to lapse into self-indulgence (much as novels about writers are), the more so when the writer is also the director (Noah Baumbach here). When this is accompanied by a running time of over two-and-a-quarter hours, the alarm bells are ringing before you even enter the cinema.Such expectations are rapidly and amply confirmed by this mis-titled movie, which drags on far too long for its own and the viewers' good. Billed as a 'marriage story', the focus is on divorce.But the subtext is 'woman triumphant in a world of pathetic men'. In short, this is yet another AMM (Anti-Man Movie).In a movie based on contrasting pairs, NYC vies with LA, East Coast with West, theatre directing with movie making, lawyer-free divorce proceedings with lawyer-dominated, in control Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) with her hapless husband, Charlie (Adam Driver). While the leading female characters are portrayed as strong, powerful, determined, funny, talented, competent and winners, the men are generally either rapacious brutes (the LA lawyer, Jay) or self-centred infants. Charlie epitomises the latter: he's really not very good at anything much apart from theatre directing. He's not much good at marriage and doesn't handle divorce well either; he's not much good with practical tasks, such as fitting a child's car seat, he's clumsy, accidentally slashing his arm with a pocket knife, and is even told by the lover with whom he had a one night stand that ended his marriage that he's not good at accepting generosity when she offers more of the same and he refuses.Charlie is not a bad guy but he's a child who needs mothering rather than an adult, a status rather crudely emphasised by the weird 1970s hairstyle he shares with his six-year old son. Moreover, Nicole cuts his hair for him too. I was half-expecting to see her spongeing him down in the bathtub and drying between his toes! Thus at the end of a furious row that, like everything else, goes on much longer than needed for dramatic effect, it is Charlie who breaks down, only to be comforted with a pat on the head by resolute Nicole. And then, in the movie's closing scene, as Charlie is about to take his son for some dad-and-lad time, Nicole notices his shoelace is untied and ties it for him. Gee, the guy can't even lace his own shoes! No wonder he couldn't cope with Nicole.Since the story itself has very little originality, everything hangs on the performances and the direction. Unfortunately, the scaffolding that holds everything together is all too evident. Often one can sense the presence of the director and the cameras lurking in front of the cast and read the directions - 'we need a set piece monologue from Scarlett here with a long close-up'. As a result, there is no chemistry between the leads because everything seems too obviously contrived. Subtlety is certainly not the movie's strong point. The only really convincing performance comes from Alan Alda who plays the kindly NY lawyer, Bert Spitz, a minor character.And then there is the uneasy attempt at mixing genres. In part this is a serious domestic drama with the fate of the warring couple's child at stake. But Baumbach also goes for humour, with some OTT performances from the LA lawyers, especially Laura Dern, and even puts in a song-and-dance number by the triumphant Nicole, her neurotic mother and ditzy sister, and a mournful solo song from Charlie. The effect of this mixture is jarring.Frankly, we couldn't wait to be divorced from this self-indulgent film.

Joy," Little joy for moviegoers in this Tale of Mrs Mop!
","If you think the story of a woman whose claim to fame is that she invented a 'miracle mop' and made millions selling it via TV shopping channels sounds a poor basis for a movie, watching Joy will do little to change your opinion. Despite its claims, there is little that is 'inspirational' or even particularly interesting about Joy Mangano's progress from schoolgirl to 'matriarch', at least as portrayed in this quasi-biopic.The film starts interestingly by thrusting the viewer into a 1980s (? - it could have been 1950s) TV soap. At this point I thought Joy would perhaps be a comedic satire on the inanities of American consumerism. With a few tweaks it could have become just that and how much more interesting and challenging that would have been.The quirky opening note rapidly fades. We soon discover that Joy's story is going to be told by her granny, a prospect that does not bode well if you are looking for gritty realism and objectivity. Since granny dies halfway through the film, we then realise that the whole thing is being narrated from beyond the grave. Poignant? No, spooky and sentimental at best. From there on the plot lumbers along conventional channels to its predetermined conclusion.As the movie progresses it becomes more leaden, especially when we encounter the head of a TV shopping channel (Bradley Cooper). He comes across as a stereotypical corporate carthorse, who truly believes that pulling his telly-shopping cart is a higher calling. When Joy succeeds, at the second attempt, in presenting her miracle mop to the World on live TV and the sales indicator goes ballistic, the studio erupts with an ovation reminiscent of the one in Mission Control when the Apollo 11 astronauts touched down on the Moon. Hey guys, calm down - it's just a mop! If Joy's triumph seems a bit too good to be true, the credibility of the ensuing story is not enhanced by demonstrations of very poor business acumen on both her and her advisers parts. She would have got nowhere on Dragon's Den! When later Joy discovers she has been double-crossed in her business dealing by a most improbable circumstance, we begin to wonder if granny has got her facts straight.One has to conclude that this rather unexciting movie is basically a star vehicle for Jennifer Lawrence. Visually, fans will not be disappointed as she is displayed in numerous full-length shots and close-ups. But the role has too little meat in it to demand much of Lawrence in the way of acting. Robert de Niro, reprising his Jack Byrnes (Meet the Fockers) character, brings some bright moments to the proceedings, not least with a very funny wedding speech. But the occasional humour sits uneasily with the serious intent of the movie to tell an uplifting tale of a woman's successful struggle against adversity.Unless you think American consumer culture really is something to get worked up over, it may prove difficult to be fully engaged by the inspirational tone of Joy. That aside, there is little here to lift this movie above the ordinary. Talk of awards and even Oscars seems wholly misplaced; one critic even describes Joy as on a par with the Hollywood classics. No wonder they say you should never believe what you read in the papers - nor what you see on the tele-shopping channels!

The Martian," More marshmallow than Martian!
","The crew of an American base on Mars are forced to make an emergency departure leaving one crew-member behind presumed dead. But he is alive! Can the stranded astronaut find a way of communicating his plight to those on Earth and survive while he awaits rescue? A fairly standard 'castaway' plot but one which offers many dramatic possibilities. Unfortunately few of these are realised in this pedestrian movie which fails to generate any significant dramatic tension. This is partly because the characterisation is thin but also because the challenges the stranded astronaut faces seem to be so easily overcome. Starvation? Grow potatoes. Punctured space-helmet? Sticky tape. Mars rover vehicle lacking power? Wire up a few solar cells. Communications equipment destroyed? Motor over to a handy Mars lander. We never sense that the 'Martian' (Matt Damon) is in a desperate, mind- and body-sapping struggle against the odds (conveniently he is a botanist).Damon effectively portrays the 'Martian' as a likable guy but the problem is how to fill the two hours of the movie that remain after he is stranded? When a character is alone and unable to communicate it needs something exceptional to keep us glued to the screen. Maybe what's going on back home will do it. Not really because the cast of characters there are verging on cardboard cut-outs. The returning crew? Likewise. And the script is written on the assumption that the audience is a little dumb, e.g. A: It will be 500 Sols (Martian days) before we can rescue him. B: But his food will run out in 300 sols. C: So he'll die before we get there. Indeed! And so may we. The movie has some good FX and the Martian landscape looks convincing. But there's nothing exceptional here to compensate for the lack of an effectively told story.In essence this is an American feel-good fantasy film, celebrating ideals of technical omnipotence, racial harmony, gender equality and international collaboration (with those cool Chinese guys and gals). If only it were so. No wonder the credits rolled to the tune of The O' Jays singing 'Love Train'. School-kids will probably join in! But, to quote Sam Goldwyn, 'Include me out!'(Viewed at the Odeon, Warrington, 06 October 2015)",5,455,731,12 October 2015
