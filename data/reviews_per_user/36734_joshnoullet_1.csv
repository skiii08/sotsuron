Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A fun film for the family :-)
","First, let me say that I'm a huge Star Wars fan. But, when The Phantom Menace came out I was in the Army and in the field training and missed the debute in theaters. So, by the time I made it to the theatre to see it, I had heard all the negative feedback and had low expectations.However, I was pleasantly surprised by the film. This is the first time we get to see Jedi Knights fighting together, and we see (arguably) the best lightsaber battle so far on film. It was a fun movie to watch. I really enjoyed it.Now, out of the five currently-released Star Wars films, this is easily the worst of the bunch. But it's not as bad as everyone says. Just watch it an have fun in a galaxy far, far away.",9,0,1,19 October 2004
