Ford v Ferrari," Good plot based on real events
","I enjoyed the movie so much that me and my friend could not stop discussing every scene. Although you might not be a big car films lover, the plot is definitely going to catch you.The characters are so intense and definitely well portrayed by Bale and Damon. It was closer to what happened in reality than I was expecting, so I appreciated that it was not an exageration.",10,1,1,7 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Dull, nothing special here
","I struggled to watch about 30 minutes of the movie, but it was just to dull to watch. The jokes that were supposed to be funny were so empty and the 'clumsiness' into the characters' play was not helping either. The story was not following anything special and I felt that most of the time was meant to be covered with an unnecessary extension of boring moments.",2,3,10,7 February 2020
