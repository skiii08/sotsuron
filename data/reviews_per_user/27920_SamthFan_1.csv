Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The film was negatively impacted by the absence of Han and Leia
","Although grand in scope and full of magnificent special effects, the film was not able to equal the earlier films due to the absence of Han and Leia. Their wit and romantic interest made up for the rather bland Jedi knights and provided spark to the dialogue of the earlier films, whereas the inclusion of the moronic Jar-Jar Binks in this film hurt it.",3,0,1,25 May 1999
