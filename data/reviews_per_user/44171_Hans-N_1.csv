Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't wait any longer, it rocks
","After reading all the bad reviews about the movie I wanted so badly to watch it to prove they were wrong. The movie was totally worth the nights at the theater and if I weren't in school I would probably see it straight for 3 days. I have already seen it twice and it was even better the second time because there are so many small things I didn't notice the first time. So if you haven't got your ticket yet I would recommend you to get it right away. Try to get an evening showing because it isn't the same when you come out and it is sunny outside.I don't want to tell you too much but Lucas is NOT rusty, he kicked some serious ass. The special effects are outstanding and graphics were smooth. Everything you have heard or read you should ignore and go and watch the movie of the millennium.",10,0,1,19 May 1999
