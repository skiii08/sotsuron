Despicable Me 2," Not as funny as the other two movies in the franchise, but alright.
","I highly enjoyed Despicable Me and the recent spin-off with the Minions, but I have mixed feelings about DM2. Granted, the animation has greatly improved since the first DM and some of the jokes are REALLY funny(the Minions at some parts, mostly Agnes), but there are some characters that were obnoxious and/or underdeveloped(Lucy, Margo, Edith) and even some of the humor is simplistic and childish(fart noises, pratfalls). What sucks is that in the other two DM movies in the franchise, the kid factor was very well realised and one of the many things that made them entertaining. But here, there is just way too much of it and it's often in your face. Other than a handful of hysterical gags and some detailed animation, DM2 is just an OK movie that doesn't hit the mark with me the way it did with DM and Minions. I did like the 3D conversion and the minion knight fight gag(I laughed so hard I cried on that one), as well as Agnes being cute and funny along with the Minions sometimes, but it's an overrated film that is strictly for the kids. Watch the first DM or go see Minions 3D,both movies I thought were great animated comedies and should be recognized more than this average film.",5,0,0,25 July 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The gem of all Star Wars movies.... and all sci-fi movies in general!
","Episode 1 has been cited as one of the biggest disappointments in cinema. Or maybe because people expected too much out of it? I don't know, all I'm saying is that this is my 2nd favorite movie of all time behind Jaws. The story is more mature than all of the Star Wars films, it's about how the Trade Federation wants the Chancellor to sign a treaty to trade routes of the Galactic Republic, but she refuses, and so there is huge chaos around the decision. Meanwhile, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi plan to train a young Anakin Skywalker. This film is truly wonderful to gaze upon, with underwater cities and dogfights that include a huge amount of imagination. Darth Maul is a more than worthy villain that has lightsaber dueling skills that are undeniably awesome. The characters add enough humor and charm to make the film more lighthearted, particularly the aliens in Naboo and Jar-Jar Binks(whom is a lovable character in my eyes). Overall, TPM is the best of the Star Wars saga and the best sci-fi movie ever made with a more adult plot than most of them, phenomenal visuals, an epic villain, and well-realized and memorable characters.",9,3,8,8 May 2015
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Whoever gives this film lower than a 10 is WRONG.
","Jaws is my favorite movie ever. But E.T. is just as much of a masterpiece as Jaws is. What made Jaws so great was the fact that it was a horror movie with tons of gore, but it was also a coming-of-age story about how Brody has to get over his dislike of the water. In E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, it follows Elliot surpassing being an adult and having to deal with E.T. being gone(in such a phenomenal ending scene that will bring on tears for generations upon generations to come). The effects, the score, the story, the characters are ALL excellent. As for the 2002 20th Anniversary version, the movie, other than a few politically correct changes I dread like the shotgun replacement and the terrorist line change, is still timeless no matter what, even with the CGI enhancements. Overall, E.T. is just fantastic. What else can be said??!!!",10,0,3,27 July 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Better than The Force Awakens!
","After last year's mildly entertaining yet sometimes frustrating TFA, I was ready to give up on modern Star Wars. However, I saw the trailer for this film and I said to myself, 'why not give it a second chance?' and I bought a ticket for a night showing the day the film was released into theaters. And I'm very glad I did. Rogue One is a fresh new take on different characters that are developed to be loved by the audience, although the same classic Star Wars feel is present with plenty of charms. For example: instead of the irritating Jar Jar Binks that doesn't fit in a Star Wars movie, a new comic relief named K-2SO is introduced as a sarcastic yet hilarious droid that doesn't need to incorporate childish fart jokes to be funny, providing the sassy humor that all OT fans adore. The CGI is absolutely seamless; everything blends in incredibly realistically with the actors and props, and the action sequences are some of the most creative I've seen at the theater this year; remember that glorious airport fight scene that Civil War showcased? Well, Rogue One tops that in as many ways as possible! Oh, and the Easter eggs, cameos and Darth Vader are just the icing on the already delicious cake- they will leave you jaw-dropped. Go see Rogue One, but make sure it's in 2D, as 3D will ruin the already amazing visuals. Have a blast!",10,4,8,8 January 2017
Rise of the Guardians," Rise Of The Guardians- visually inventive, heartwarming, action-packed and funny
","I didn't see this in theatres when it first came out, I actually got it as a gift from my aunt in March 2013. When I watched it, I was stunned! I found myself engaged by the action scenes, charmed by Jack Frost's backstory, laughing at the jokes, and dazzled by the animation. Although occasionally the story relies too much on action and it can be predictable at times, this film rocks! The elves, yetis and fairies are cute and funny, as well as Hugh Jackman's hilarious performance as the Easter Bunny. Whenever Jack Frost and Bunny argue, it's priceless. Jack's backstory is fully fleshed-out and develops his character entirely. The visual effects and character animation are downright beautiful. Also, I have this on Blu-ray 3D and the 3D effects are some of the best I've seen in an animated film. Rise Of The Guardians is an underrated masterpiece that should've been seen by more people, given it's known as a box office disappointment.",9,1,1,3 January 2016
Suicide Squad," Worth seeing more than once!
","After seeing the trailer before Deadpool back in February, I had high hopes for Suicide Squad, since DC films have needed their dose of energy and variety lately, with no humor and not a lot of compelling storytelling. The actual movie itself, however, did that and more- while watching this movie, I tried to find any flaws, but I didn't find anything that I disliked. Everything hits the right notes- the amazingly vintage song choices the trailers promised, the increased number of jokes, the cameos, the character development, the action sequences, the performances- the list goes on and on. One thing that needs to be addressed- Suicide Squad is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, I laughed out loud more times in a theater than any movie I've seen this year- even the audience was cracking up, too! The action sequences are infinitely fantastic- I watched this movie both in standard 2D and 3D with IMAX, and the movie looks great in either format that can be chosen. I loved this movie so much, I'm already seeing it a third time with one of my best friends, and I barely see a movie more than once in the theater! Don't listen to all the haters on the Internet- it's what you want to watch, not what others instruct you to watch.",10,1,7,24 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Worst Star Wars ever made
","I like Star Wars. Especially The Empire Strikes Back, which is a gem in cinema. I even loved The Phantom Menace, which I find an extremely underrated film and one of the best in the saga. This was a disappointment. The performances by Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are the worst portrayals of Star Wars characters I've ever seen, and Jar Jar is not there for light hearted bits. Now, Jar-Jar at least brought some charm to make TPM happier. Here, he is just there for some important things and that's it. The script is very lazy and boring, nothing anybody said worth remembering, just like Roger Ebert said, bless his soul. While I will admit that Mace Windu is cool in this with the lightasaber duels and the clone troopers are very epic when it comes to the battles, AOTC is just a stiff, forgettable, and just plain frustrating Star Wars film only being released for toys.",4,0,6,22 May 2015
Ant-Man," Hilarious and intense fun for the whole family!!!!
","I had high hopes for Ant Man, mostly because Paul Rudd(a comedy genius in my book) and Marvel will again be mixing humor with action scenes. And Ant Man is a ton of fun!! I saw the 3:30 3D screening the day after it came out, and my whole family agreed that it was AWESOME. What's not to love about Ant Man? The action is a load of intense moments, the comedy is constantly hilarious, the story is charming and well-executed, the acting is top-notch, and the 3D is fantastic. Do see it and see it in 3D, as the action scenes and the shrinking sequences add a whole new world to the viewing experience. There is not one flaw with the movie, and I recommend that everybody go see it and have a great time. Also, stay for the end credits, as there is two scenes that I won't spoil, but they are amazing. Don't listen to the haters- Ant Man is a perfect movie.",10,1,12,23 July 2015
Over the Hedge," One of the funniest animated films I've ever seen
","Over The Hedge is a movie made by DreamWorks that I actually enjoy. Mostly because it's freaking hilarious from start to finish. The humor is frequently cartoonish and clever, with slapstick that's inventive and cultural references that will make adults giggle. Sure, the story is very predictable, but that's about all I think is bad about this animated gem. The standout here is Hammy, a hyperactive squirrel that is voiced by the comedy legend of all, Steve Carell. He will make you laugh so hard in this that you will be in tears(ex. the energy drink scene, the impersonation of a squirrel with rabies). The animation is also vivid and colorful, with the textures and fur improving over Madagascar. The villain of the movie is voiced by Nick Nolte, and he is ruthless and awesome in his role. Overall, despite a generic plot, Over The Hedge is an uproariously funny, well-voiced, and great looking animated comedy that is a rare winner from DreamWorks.",9,0,0,24 May 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Fun for the whole family! A keeper for any superhero movie buff!
","On May 6th, 7:00 PM, at a packed IMAX theater, there once was a group of four- a movie enthusiast, one of his best friends, his brother and his mother that was watching a little film released by Marvel Studios titled Captain America: Civil War. The previews before the film were either already viewed previously or largely unappealing(with the exception of a preview for Finding Dory). During the first act of the film, the group was certainly getting antsy due to the lack of events going on, despite the occasional great scene. However, once the first act starts to come to a close, lots of things started to turn up and as the film gradually moved on, it got better and better, one scene being topped by the next scene. The amount of humor starts to increase at major levels, the action starts to become more inventive and exciting, and the characters start to develop step by step. The two reasons why I have to give this film a 9 instead of a 10 are because one, the politics did confuse and bore me quite a bit during the majority of the first act, and two, the amount of non- action scenes with little to no tension did become bothersome to me. The rest of the film's quality- well, it's just pure gold, no doubt about it. Every set-piece that knows it's tone executes the scene so perfectly- the action is often engaging and having a high intensity level, the characterizations are fully fleshed out, the comedy is extremely brash yet frequently hilarious(Spidey had everyone in the cinema hall rolling) and the script is full of sharp quips and smart twists and turns. Not only that, but seeing all these Marvel heroes fighting each other for an estimated 17 minutes(such freshly imaginative use of IMAX 3D, by the way) will bring back childhoods of many(including me) that loved Marvel in the past. Overall, Captain America: Civil War is a slam-dunk great time at the movies, full of humor, awe, excitement and reasons why superhero movies can be even be enjoyed by non-fans of comics, and it will definitely stand as one of the best Friday nights I've ever had, and the rest of the audience in the theater I was in can agree with that, as they cheered the movie on fairly loudly at the end of the movie. Also, stay tuned for two post-credit scenes; you won't regret it for a second! And while the movie has great 3D effects, especially on a huge IMAX screen, the 2D version would be just as great if you don't care for 3D.",9,2,10,11 June 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Just as good as Days Of Future Past- can't wait to see what happens next
","On Saturday, I went with a friend to go see X-Men: Apocalypse because I needed to spend some time out of the house and with my friend I haven't seen in a while. I did see DOFP in the cinema as well and I highly enjoyed that one, although I don't remember much about it other than that fantastic Quiksilver scene and the ending, and I highly enjoyed this one as well! What makes this X-Men interesting is that it revolves around different themes and other items in storytelling than in most superhero films released in this day and age, and for some, it might be easy to confuse or frustrate. But I appreciate this new brand of storytelling in this film, I think what any comic book movie should do is make you think to make it unique in its own way, and this film does that to make it something genuinely special. Oh, by the way- Oscar Isaac NAILED it as Apocalypse, he's so intimidating to the point where I would watch it solely because of him! And although all of the action sequences are so much fun, there are two of them that stole the entire movie for me- if you thought Quiksilver's scene in DOFP was amazing, you ain't seen nothing yet! I'm already seeing this movie again in the theater, and I honestly think it's that level of worthy! Also, I did see this in 3D, and although it doesn't add much to the movie's quality, the added depth does look nice in a lot of certain set-pieces, so if you love 3D, then you'll probably get a kick out of this one, and I thought it looked cool enough, so whether you watch it in 2D or 3D, this movie's a lot of fun all around.",10,11,18,1 June 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Finally, a great Spidey movie that's not Spider-Man 2!
","As a fan of Marvel, Spider-Man is one of their best in my opinion. The comics are great, the film adaptations, however, I'm not that fond of. Spider-Man was just OK, Spider-Man 2 was flawless, Spider-Man 3 was really bad, and The Amazing Spider-Man was good, but not memorable. I walked in the theater with semi-high expectations, because I read some reviews and was skeptical about it. However, it was actually fantastic, and is definitely going in the best Marvel movies ever made. I was surprised by the performances of Dane DeHaan(Green Goblin), and Andrew Garfield(Spider-Man), both fitting their roles very well.The special effects are spectacular and imaginative, particularly the web-slinging scenes and Electro's skin. I have an issue with Paul Giamatti's performance as Aleskei Systevech/Rhino and the Sony marketing, but TAS2 is still very awesome and underrated. Even my mom enjoyed it, who doesn't like Spider-Man! Surprisingly, there was applause at the end, so the audience must have liked it.",9,28,47,23 March 2015
Big Hero 6," Greatest animation of all time
","Big Hero 6 was really funny, beautiful to look at, and very charming! The jokes are adorable, with a lot of hilarious scenes with Baymax(the whole theater erupted with laughter whenever the fist bump part came on) and plenty of clever dialogue from the other characters. The animation is very colorful and lifelike, with realistic character animation and unique action scenes and backgrounds. The film is not without its heart, as the charm of Baymax and the surprises will hit the mark in the soul. Overall, Big Hero 6 is a true phenomenon in animation with cute humor, imaginative visuals, a huge heart and some very cool surprises. This is the best animated film of all time!",10,47,69,7 May 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Action-packed,heartfelt and really funny
","I love Marvel. Spider-Man, Wolverine, Hulk, you name it-I love them all. However, when I heard about Marvel making a movie called 'Guardians Of The Galaxy', my reaction was: 'What? Who are they?'. When I went to see this movie, I had low expectations because I didn't know the characters(except Rocket Raccoon, I know him a bit) and I was not impressed with a few recent MCU movies(like Iron Man 2 and Thor: The Dark World). I actually loved it! There are plenty of tear-jerking scenes like the intro and a bar scene with Rocket. The comedy is genuinely funny with absolutely no farting or poop humor. However, if you aren't a fan of goofball jokes, you won't really like it, according to some negative comments on here. Also, I had a lot of fun with the characters and action scenes, especially in 3D. I had no problems with this movie whatsoever. This is up there with my best movies of all time, along with Jaws and The Matrix.",10,1,4,20 March 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age Of Ultron ROCKS..... Way better than the first!
","In my humble opinion, the first Avengers was good, but not one of Marvel's best...LIKE THIS!!! Age Of Ultron is truly an Avengers film and is one of the best superhero films of all time. Granted, the inventor creates something that goes haywire plot is a tad predictable, and Quicksilver is not a character that you will care about. Other than that, this film is golden! The action is definitely better than the original, I was on the edge of my seat at some points.... but how can I not mention the Hulkbuster scene?! It's just amazing from start to finish, and it mixes humor and fighting very well. The 3D is also extremely cool, most namely the opening action scene, which had a shot that got butterflies in my stomach. The comedy is consistently laugh-out loud funny, especially the Hulk gets punched several times one(the whole entire theater was laughing like crazy when that came along). I was also impressed by Ultron, who is both a ruthless villain who wants to destroy the world and a lovable robot that cracks several funny jokes. The characters will pull your emotional strings because of how well-written they are, and will leave you with a grin when they fight. Age Of Ultron is a must-see for everyone and you will be satisfied.",9,0,3,16 May 2015
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," The one Transformers movie that's good.
","I actually saw this movie at a generally filled theater in Virginia around early July of 2009, a tad bit after it's official release in late June. I was 8 years old and I liked the first Transformers, although not as much as my brother, who was 6 at the time, who was a huge fanatic of all sorts of robots and creatures fighting in the Saturday morning cartoons, and he was extremely pumped, but I wasn't too excited, although I did think it looked like a good movie. I saw it with my family, and we loved it! I didn't know this got bad reviews at the time because I wasn't familiar with film critics, and I won't say it's perfect, but it's a great summer film in its own right. The action and special effects are extravagant, particularly the forest battle and whenever a computerized Transformer is interacting with a human character. But I'll say that some of the comedy maybe a little too awkward to watch with families, in addition, the Leo character wasn't important nor funny in the slightest. Other than a couple of small problems, ROTF is a ton of fun for Transformers fans and action movie fans.",9,1,1,2 January 2016
Jaws," The best movie ever made
","Jaws is my favorite movie. Out of all the excellent films I've seen in my life(ex. The Two Towers, Guardians Of The Galaxy), this is the gem of them all. This movie has everything: suspense, drama, comedy, horror... EVERYTHING! The story is simple- man vs. shark. But somehow, Spielberg made a basic plot work entirely! First off, the characters are not only lovable and hilarious, but they give the sense of heart and fear for them. The shark scenes are consistently thrilling and fun to watch, close-up or not. The humor is filled with extremely witty one-liners and a few mature jokes(coming from Quint). The acting is fast- paced from start to finish, one of the biggest reasons why the characters are easy to connect with and like. Overall, Jaws is the greatest movie of all time in my opinion because of its fantastic cast of characters, intense shark sequences, smart humor, and a huge heart in the core of it.",10,2,6,12 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," 2nd best of the Star Wars saga behind Episode I
","Revenge of the Sith is a ton of fun. It has everything I could ever ask for in a movie(like The Phantom Menace) and is the darkest of the saga. It has amazing CGI, amazing performances, amazing action scenes, amazing characters, and an amazing score. Although there is a dark heart in Episode III, there is still humor involved, and it's actually funny(ex. 'Flying is for droids'). ROTS features a few of the best action scenes in the series- Yoda vs. Sidious(both the lightsaber battle and the flying discs) Anakin vs. Dooku Anakin vs. Obi-Wan Order 66 Intro dogfight Mace Windu vs. Palpatine Overall, ROTS is a fantastic movie for everyone filled with heart-pounding action scenes, good humor, stunning visual effects, top-notch performances, and a dark heart. Prepare to be dazzled.",10,3,6,9 August 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," One of the best superhero movies ever made.... IGNORE ALL DOWNERS!
","Fans, don't listen to these Michael Bay-loving haters that just do this for attention. TDKR is truly a masterpiece in superhero film history. Now, as a fan of Batman and Christopher Nolan, I believe that a final film of a trilogy should be the most intense and most jaw- dropping(Toy Story 3, Return Of The King). THIS is what a Batman movie should be like- excellent performances that both fit the character and define their portrayals, eye-popping visuals that are filmed creatively and are designed fluently(WITHOUT the use of 3D, made in IMAX only), a smartly-told and unique storyline with epic action scenes and bone- chilling drama, and an awesome villain that is as ruthless and developed as Darth Vader from The Empire Strikes Back. These all describe TDKR and more. This film is truly a gem in filmmaking and should be less scorned(in fact, it should be recognized as the best superhero film ever made along with GOTG). Please do see this one.",10,5,9,20 May 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The black soldier turns on the blue and red supermodel- and it's excellent.
","I saw this movie twice in the theater- once with my friend and once with my family- both times were awesome, no doubt. Almost everything is on the top of totem pole of superhero movies- the acting, the script, the orchestral score, the character development, the effects, the list goes on. The backstory of Bruce Wayne is handled marvelously, with an already heart-wrenching scene at the very beginning of the movie that does more justice in the film later. Ben Affleck nails the character of Batman, providing loads of soul and tech-savvy goodness to boast likability from the audience. The rest of the cast shines here as well, from the witty performance of Jeremy Irons as Pennyworth to the charming character that Henry Cavill reprised from Man Of Steel. The visuals are outstanding, particularly the practical effects. How can Hollywood pull all this off, I have no clue, but they do a lot right, that's a surefire fact. Can't wait to see Suicide Squad pull many more practical stunts later on! Lastly, I saw the film at an IMAX theater in 3D 45 minutes away from my home and I've got to say, it was definitely worth the extra expensive price. Everything popped out of the screen like it should have, the crisp picture matched with the color schemes and the sound let out a mighty roar when it needed to. Overall, Batman v. Superman: Dawn Of Justice is definitely a winner for any DC fan or non-DC fan, whether you liked Man Of Steel or not. Every cast member shines as their characters, the visuals are beguiling as ever, and the heart is still present. It may not be for everyone, but it's a goldmine for me!",9,0,1,2 August 2016
Toy Story 3," Awesome movie! One of my favorite animations EVER!
","Back in 2010, I was living in Spain, and me and my family went to go see this at the drive- in at the Naval Base(my dad was in the Navy for years, so the movie was in English because there were many Americans living there). My dad and my brother thought it was not that good, my mom and I thought it was great! The visuals are brilliantly creative and somewhat realistic, the gags are hilarious, the heart is darker than the other two, the voice work is delightful and the score by Randy Newman is absolutely amazing! I'm getting this for my 3D TV because some people say the 3D effects are spectacular. And on that note, the attention to detail looks like it can fit the technology. I love this movie, it's the best of the three Toy Storys and the perfect finale to an already perfect trilogy. I give this 10/10, no flaws with this movie at all.",10,1,2,28 January 2016
Deadpool," Overwhelmingly funny and action-packed!
","Deadpool is definitely a comedy worth seeing. I saw a packed screening and the people in the theater laughed almost non-stop, and my dad admitted that it was a film worth watching again. The action and special effects are loads of fun, but beware that there's a lot of blood and gore invested. Same goes for the humor-the gags are often juvenile and crass(such as sexual activity on a holiday or hinting at 'touching' oneself's), so this is FAR from a family film. Deadpool is a great time at the movies, but just expect more adult material from the typical average Marvel film. If there's one thing the movie does often, it frequently breaks the 4th wall, and it's one of the really great things about Deadpool. This movie has everything you could ever ask from a Deadpool movie, and this is a strong recommendation for Marvel fans and adults everywhere. Also, stay after the credits AND during the credits-it will make you laugh your head off.",10,6,18,13 February 2016
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of my favorite movies(along with The Phantom Menace)
","The Empire Strikes Back is one of the few movies I call pitch perfect. Everything is flawless- the action? Edge of your seat! The drama? Heart-wrenching and powerful! The comedy? Frequently clever and hysterical! The special effects? Better than A New Hope, and then some! As for the 2004 DVD version, it still has the original flavor of the theatrical cut, the touches are few, and still has most shots from the original version. Also, may I add that all of the characters are perfectly developed and lovable, villain or hero. Han Solo is a great character in this, all because of his charming and awesome performance by Harrison Ford. My favorite character from Star Wars is Chewbacca, and there is no exception here. The stop motion animation done with the AT-ATs and the Taun-Tauns still are amazing today, and the wonders of the ship battles are just as beautiful. Overall, Empire is my favorite Star Wars, and one of my favorite movies. It has everything- heart, humor, action, drama, suspense. I highly recommend you see this one(if you haven't seen it already).",10,3,6,17 May 2015
Minions," The better movie out of the Despicable Me franchise.
","After reading mixed reviews, I was still pumped to see Minions, but a little bit suspicious about if it will be an average kids spin-off that's meant to sell plush toys and Happy Meals. Therefore, I saw the 3D 3:20 screening of the film and- surprisingly, it was a great, cute, and fun movie for all ages to enjoy! The story at first parodies documentaries in a genuinely quirky technique, followed by a few hilarious antics caused by the minions!! But the story also follows the quest of three minions(Kevin, Bob, and Stuart) to find a new boss to work for. This part also is executed very cleverly, with plenty of British stereotype jokes that made me laugh hard and slapstick comedy that made me giggle like Looney Tunes!! Although a few of the funniest gags are in the ads and Sandra Bullock feels phoned in, the movie was hysterical, beautiful to look at(especially in 3D), and the voice actors are top notch. Plus, there is a cameo that I won't spoil, but it's pretty damn awesome. Hell, even the soundtrack was EPIC, no pop songs at all!! Overall, Minions is a hilarious treat for everyone filled with laugh out loud moments and charm. See it in 3D also, you won't miss a thing.",9,10,18,22 July 2015
The Martian," Amazing!! Destined to be one of the best space movies ever made!!!!
","This movie rocked the house!! What can I say? The only movie I truly was astonished by this year was Ant-Man, and this one is up there with one of the best movies of the year. I recently saw Hotel Transylvania 2, and while the animation was imaginative and there were some really funny scenes, I kind of thought, 'eh, it's not bad, just so much potential wasted'. With The Martian, the potential is realized and fulfilled, and a whole lot more added to that. The main surprise in this movie is the fact that it has more optimism than any other thriller I've seen-and I love it when movies strive to avoid predictability in emotion of the characters. Matt Damon was excellent in this because of his huge amount of likability and charms, but was frightened and tense when he needed to be. Jeff Daniels is definitely the best performance of the movie other than Damon in my opinion. I saw the 3D screening of this movie and the opening scene and the vistas of Mars landscapes and planet overviews immersed me into the intensity of the suspense shown. Awesome 70s soundtrack. I'd recommend this piece of art to any movie buff, Ridley Scott fan, or space movie fan any day. Definitely a Blu-ray collection addition in my book.",10,9,21,20 October 2015
