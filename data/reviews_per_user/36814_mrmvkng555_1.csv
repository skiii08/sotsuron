Hereditary," Judge a story by its ending. In this case, ridiculous.
","At least Paranormal Activity is honest about what it is. I would much rather watch those movies than this silly schlock. The plot ultimately ends up being a cliched attempt at the family-serves-demon story similar to to the Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch movies, which don't put on any pretense of a being a serious art film. The worst part is it's attempt to be taken like a serious art film-acting, cinematography, music-when the outcome of the plot is cliched and ordinary. This creates an overwhelming emotional disappointment when you consider the ending compared to how seriously the film takes itself. You can't build up an audience based on the supposed authentic and realistic family dysfunction and then just blame it all on some demon cult. I want the last two hours back. Ugh.",1,1,3,15 September 2018
