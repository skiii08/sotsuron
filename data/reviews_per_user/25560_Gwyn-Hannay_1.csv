Sucker Punch," Boredom and tragedy do not mix...
","The ending to this movie is comparable with Pan's Labyrinth. I hated that movie because it was so hurtful to watch. This one I hate even more because you already know that the end will be tragic, and then actually getting to it is incredibly boring.I think my husband summed it up nicely: You can't have a movie comprised of someone's delusions without having regular cut backs to reality.The entire thing was one girl's delusions, and then delusions on top of *those* ones, with no reference as to what might have actually been happening in 'reality' (we can guess, but we shouldn't have to). When I realised that this movie was never going to be anything more than a pathetic mission to retrieve four items and then ridiculously pointless fight scenes, it was such a drag having to sit through the rest of this bore-fest.Honestly, one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",1,4,10,13 January 2012
