Ford v Ferrari," Brilliant for all, Bale was phenomenal
","Even though this is a movie about motor racing, specifically Le Mans, I found that even non-enthusiasts would enjoy it. It's about the journey Shelby and Miles go on. The 2 hours 30 minutes don't feel like a drag which is a testament to the flow of the movie.Matt Damon was really good as Carroll Shelby, I mean really good. Christian Bale as Ken Miles on the other hand, phenomenal. Oscar worthy performance as he completely throws himself fully in the role.The sound mixing and editing just felt on point and could well be award winning too.Go out to watch it, it's worth the hype and lives up to the trailer.",8,3,9,16 November 2019
Hereditary," Let down by its ending
",It was a good enough occult horror although I did feel like it dragged on a little. The ending whilst tying up loose ends does make you feel disappointed and sadly that's the main feeling you get left with afterwards.,7,0,1,19 March 2019
A Star Is Born," Slow but good once it picks up the pace
","I would say 7.5 as my rating. The movie is slow at the start but then as the movie progresses in the second half, it definitely picks up and the story gets more interesting.On Gaga, she was brilliant. Her acting was really good and of course her singing we already know how great a performer she is.However, I think the real star is Bradley Cooper who plays a drunk for most of the film and really well. I assumed he already had an Oscar but was surprised when I looked after watching the film he hasn't. He's no Leo but I see him getting one at some point.",8,0,1,5 May 2019
The Irishman," Too long
","I can't comment too much on how good or bad it is, I felt it was okay.This was mainly due to its length. Maybe I should have broke it down into two viewings.On that note, I'll leave me review short ;-)",7,3,8,30 November 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Best spiderman film?
","I think this is the best spiderman film yet. Definitely a lot of that is down to the animation style being punchy visuals and vibrant colours ala the comic book effect. I mean it looks beautiful. The story as well benefits from this as there's so much that can be achieved compared to a live action film. The plot itself was great and clearly heads the story into a different direction, I expect there to be many more Spiderman films in this format as it's independent of any live action series.",9,1,3,22 February 2019
Toy Story 4," They've done it again
","After Toy Story 3, you'd think the series was wrapped up yet somehow they've done it again. The story is satisfying enough and feels like this time it will indeed be the last. You do have to marvel at the CG animation and the crazy leaps and bounds it has made since the first Toy Story 24 years prior, the scene where the cat 'stretches', you think is an actual cat and the light shining off the faces of Bo or Woody was something they just could not do back in 1995. I don't think anyone will feel let down as the tried and tested formula delivers once again.",8,1,4,4 July 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not great (last half) but not bad (first half) either
","Given my title, it's surprising that I gave this a 6/10 or 3/5, which for me means below average but not bad either. A lot of reviews are either 8-9/10 or really low which emphasise the love it or hate it nature, I've tried to be fair.I was really excited to watch this after hearing of the initial response it got and high rating of 9.5+/10. I made the mistake of forgetting that just because critics love a movie, regular folk may not.I want to start by saying I have no criticism to the acting of this film. Di Caprio brilliantly plays an actor who I can only describe as knowing his best days are over and the drink he needs to cope with this. Pitt is his stunt double and chauffeur who comes to his own in the latter half. Margot, well she really doesn't do much, again that's not her fault.The problem with OUATIH is mainly the plot and slow pace. All of this would have been forgiven had the main scene the film builds up to been more accurate. Instead you get the feeling of being underwhelmed by it despite this being a fictionalised version of events.To my final point, the critics seem to love Tarantino and this kind of movie, I just feel the average movie goer will not. If this was on TV, I would have changed the channel after around half an hour. Which then makes me think that QT has employed Di Caprio and Pitt to draw people in to watch the film. I went into this as a fan of Leo who if someone else was cast in his place, I probably would not have been interested. Having said that, if Christopher Nolan was directing, it could have had a load of nobodies in and I would still watch it.If you got this far, I'm a huge Leonardo Di Caprio fan and his acting was really good. Not brilliant or award winning mind you. Despite that, I feel like I'm doing an injustice by giving this 6/10. I can't think of another movie of his that I've watched and thought of as this low.",6,7,10,18 August 2019
The Lion King," Good but not as good as the original animation
","Disney have done a good job with the live action CGI remake. However, this film struggles to capture some of the feelings and emotions of the original cartoon animation. In particular, the facial expressions of the animals suffer. In their defence though, animation will always have more creative freedom than a live action film, a brilliant example of this is Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse. Elsewhere, the score was good not really much different to the original, perhaps lacking courage to try something different for fear of the fans of the original complaining.",7,0,1,21 July 2019
Green Book," Eye opening look at racism in the US only 60 years ago
","Brilliant performances from both lead actors and the story itself felt like a brilliant message. The more we learn about the people we don't commonly associate with, the less likely we are to be prejudiced to them. My only issue and this on a personal level, the movie felt long, I get it's essentially a road trip but at times felt boring as a result.",7,2,4,13 February 2019
