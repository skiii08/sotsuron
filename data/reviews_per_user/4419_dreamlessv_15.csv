Alien 3," What should have been the last Alien
","When I first saw Alien 3, I really did not like it at all.  I saw it a few more times, and I found myself enjoying it.  It does not have the suspense of Alien or the intensity of Aliens, but it had a new dramatic depth to Ripley's character.  She had nothing left to lose and decided to go on a suicide run against the Alien.  Charles S. Dutton was very good in it, as were a few other criminals.  It was a little dark, but it beats Alien Resurrection and is, in my opinion, the third best of the series.  It could have been a lot better.",8,1,4,7 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Every Generation has a legend(this is not it)
","Some one must have paid George Lucas A LOT of money to make this movie, and it shows.  'The Phantom Menace' is to Star Wars as what 'Alien Resurrection' was to the Alien series.  They both ruined great series by big dumb plots and stupid characters. First of all, the movie hardly resembles Star Wars.  It seems to have better technology in the movie than the first 3, and there is a huge overabundance of special-effects.  In the first one there were alien characters, but this, like every other character is an alien, or looks like one.  It is sick.  The movie is so dependent on special effects Lucas paid no attention to the script. The script sucks.  I didn't give a damn when any weird-named character died because the characters were so underdeveloped.  I did not care about Qui-Gonn, Jar Jar, Obi-Wan, Queen Amidalia, Anakin(boy, did Jake Lloyd suck). The movie was marketed to death.  George Lucas sold out, and I bet you he does it in Episode II.  I am not anticipating Episode II after having seen Episode I.",1,4,8,11 February 2000
The Terminator," Good, but not great
","I decided to rent this movie awhile ago.  I hadn't seen it in awhile, so I figured what the heck.  Well, Terminator wasn't as good as I remember it, but it does have its moments.  First of all, sometimes it was very obvious that they used a puppet face for Arnold.  Second, Linda Hamilton sucked.  She just went around saying 'Omigod, omigod, omigod.' Arnold (I'm more used to seeing him as a good guy) just didn't have it. Michael Biehn was the highlight of the movie.  That guy should've been famous.  Anyways, it clearly shows signs of date, but it is still pretty good.",7,2,4,17 March 2000
American Pie," One Long Stupid Joke
","I'll be frank, I'm suprised to see all the phrase for the movie.  I (and I am a 14 year old) thought this movie was a long, stupid, immature, unfunny joke that just didn't know when to stop.  The writers thought that each gag would be funnier than the last.  They were wrong.  The movie was nothing but unoriginal, uninspired sight-gags which tried to show a 'human' side (in a film that exploits your most deeply 'human' urges) by playing some sappy music and showing some teens have sex (am I the only who, after all the references to condoms, noticed no one seemed to be having protected sex?) could make up for a retarted bore of a movie.",2,3,7,22 August 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Slammin'! But...
","Don't get me wrong, Terminator 2 was one of the best films I've ever seen.  The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, it has action, comedy and a little human touch.  It totally surpases its predicessor in every single way.  The final fight between the T-800 and T-1000 rivals Sigourney Weaver vs. the Alien Queen as, in my opinion, the best showdown ever.  The only thing that I didn't like (I thought about this more, even though they kind of explained it) was paradoxes.  The more I thought about this time travel jargin, Terminator 1 and the destruction of Cyberdyne, I kept thinking of paradoxes.  It doesn't matter, because T2 is a great movie.",9,1,1,25 March 2000
The Patriot," Pure Gestapho Propaganda
","It sickens me to see so many people liked this garbage.  First of all, the characters sucked.  They were so poorly developed I felt NOTHING when anyone died.  The acting was awful, and the only people who gave a have decent performance were the British (especially Isaacs).  The war scenes were SO POORLY DONE.  The battle scenes and other scenes were loaded with so many glitches I was expecting to see the English weilding M-16s and M-79s and the Good Old Boys brandishing potbellied Apache helicopters and rocket launchers.  In the end, all this is is Gestapo Propaganda and a sorry excuse for sacrificing history in the name of red-blooded patriotism.",3,2,4,28 August 2000
Aliens," TOP OF THE LINE
","Alliens is one of the best movies of all time.  Great characters, great action and great all around movie.  It picks right off where Alien left off and never gets boring, even in the begining.  One of the last great action films from one of the greatest movie series ever.  See it.",10,1,2,11 February 2000
Pearl Harbor," Ridiculous, sappy, cliched war movie
","(Just so you know, what I'm writing about the movie in no way reflects my opinions of the actual Pearl Harbor.  I totally recognize the heroic sacrific they made to ensure our way of life, and this is strictly about the MOVIE)           I was so excited about seeing this movie.  The previews made it look like a 100% adrenline rush.  A love story?  Okay, as long as it isn't overblown.  Unfortuantly, I was gravely mistaken. Probably the most entertaining thing about the whole movie was the first half of the attack.  It was simply amazing, watching the Zeros swarm in and out of the ships.  But, the second half, when Ben Affleck takes to the sky, became boring because the whole thing was SO TEDIOUS.            Man, this movie was so overdone.  The first hour and a half were INSANELY BORING.  EVERYONE has to answer every question with a monologue. The characters are uninteresting, boring and I can't even name five people from the lot.  The love triangle was contrived and allowed everyone in the movie to become part of a war cliche.  Everything was tedious about the introduction.  It was like staring at a wall for fourty-five minutes with romatic music in the background.  Even after the attack, it was so tedious because SO LITTLE action happened. Contrived, sappy, melodramatic and generally BAD is what Pearl Harbor is.  If you want to see a good World War II movie, see Enemy at the Gates.  This gets a 4/10, only for the attack.",4,0,0,27 May 2001
Independence Day," Terrible
","The first time I saw this movie four years ago, it became a religion for me.  However, looking back on it I realize Independence Day was the the queen mother of movie glitches. The characters are way too stereotypical.  Just look at Will Smith's character.  The aliens were probably what killed the movie.  If they are so primitive, how do they build such huge, high-tech spaceships?  The design was vile and looks like one of the rejects from Alien. With bad acting, glitches galore and the excitment level of watching chromosones divide, pass it.",5,0,1,21 February 2000
Army of Darkness," Groovy.
","Army of Darkness, one of the greatest, campiest, wittiest and all around fun films of our time.  A movie not ment to be taken seriously, Ash, the hero from Evil Dead I and II is sent back through time to save a town from the army of the dead.  It's loaded with fun action, insanley awesome one-liners, comedy, romance and an all around warm bubbly feeling.",9,1,1,16 May 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Quite Possibly the Greatest Film Ever Made
","'The Return of the King' is one of the few movies ever made that truly transcends its medium.  By weaving together an amazing tapestry of characters, plot, music, and setting in one magnum opus, Peter Jackson has cleft a breath-taking adventure that sees every path cross in this third chapter.  Despite its minor flaws, 'The Return of the King' hurtles 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy into the stratosphere of film-making.  The heroism and humanity of its characters evokes emotions I never thought possible in a movie.  From the opening scene with Deagoul and Smeagoul to the final cosmic battle for Middle-Earth, 'The Return of the King' enthralls the viewer every second.    When Thomas Edison made the first movies over 100 years ago, did he ever imagine a film could move us as 'The Return of the King' has?",10,0,0,21 December 2003
Braveheart," MY FAVORITE!
","(SPOILERS)
       Braveheart, in my book, is the greatest movie ever made.  The epic saga of William Wallace's battle for freedom is played out.  Though terribly inaccurate historically, it does not hamper the enjoyment of this beautiful film.  Ever moment throughout the film, especially that one, beautiful line that was delievered perfectly before Wallace dies, was perfect.  Every single performance is mind blowing.  The score is SUPERB (I bought the soundtrack just for 'The Legend Spreads')and the battle scenes are breath-taking. More than just a great film, Braveheart will change you.  I now play the bagpipes because of this film.  You will want to NEVER surrender to anything after seeing the determination William Wallace showed. The best scene, next to 'The Legend Spreads' is the end.  It is the greatest scene I have ever witnessed on the silver screen.  SEE BRAVEHEART NOW!",10,4,7,31 March 2000
Gladiator," Looking Back...
","I just watched 'Gladiator' the other day, and to be honest, it's not as great as I remember.  Sure the fight scenes are great, but at some points it becomes boring and uninteresting.  The acting is okay, except I found Joaquin Phoenix to get a bit annoying.  It's not quite on the same level as 'Braveheart'.  Watch that one instead.  6/10",6,0,1,17 August 2001
Jurassic Park," Truely Amazing
","I can still remember, being only seven when it still came out, and watched as those opening credits and thundering music came on the screen. Hell, I even remember when the T-Rex came crashing out of the fence.  I loved Jurassic Park in 1993 as much as I did now.  The characters were quite good for this type of movie, and I really did care for them. The score was breathtaking, and I even remember the opening lines of John William's score when the helicopter first comes in sight of the island.  The dinosaurs were amazing effects wise, and still are.  Jurassic Park is the last true adventure movie, and is still as amazing, suspenseful and spectacular as it was 7 years ago.10/10",10,1,3,8 October 2000
Evil Dead II," Better than Evil Dead, not as good as AOD
","SPOILERS!        Evil Dead II, practically a remake of Evil Dead is a good movie, but not great.  Ash, our favorite anti-hero from ED1 goes back to the woods with Linda, where they find the Necronomicon and all hell breaks loose.  Now, the first one failed because it was too tedious, but ED2 doesn't really have that happen.  The rift in space-time towards the end was a good twist, and so was that unforgettable part when Ash gets a chainsaw for a hand.  Other than that, it's pretty much the same as ED1, which in some ways is good, and some ways is bad.(BTW, the acting improved by leaps and bounds) 8/10",8,0,0,28 May 2000
