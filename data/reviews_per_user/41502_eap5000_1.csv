Sucker Punch," It had so much potential
","When I saw this movie, I loved it. The strange and exotic fantasy realms, the frame tell style, the action, and the idea. It just wasn't pulled off nearly as well as it could have been. Some of the actors were pretty weak. I think Emily Browning may have been the only decent performer, although the gentlemen who played Blue and The Wise Man were just fine. The other secondary rolls made the movie feel cheesy and cheap. This was exacerbated by some moments of crumby dialogue. This could have easily been a 9 out of ten with a script tune up and some better supporting actresses. Oh and one more thing, (Actually I really disliked that repeated line) I think that a little more focus on the asylum and/or her home would have been good too.",10,0,3,6 October 2011
