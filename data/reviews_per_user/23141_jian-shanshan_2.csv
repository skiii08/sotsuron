The Incredible Hulk," One of the best super hero movies, as good as 'iron man'
","After watching the iron man, I was pretty motivated for the summer superhero season. The total experience of watching incredible Hulk is sweet and satisfaction. I was stunned by the beauty of Liv, and actually felt that the Hulk was kinda good looking in the film. I'm not a big fan of the fist movie, though I don't think it is bad either. I've kept a high expectation of the second one ever since the trailer was out, but I never expect this to be such a fantastic and sexy movie. Nice little surprise at the end just round the story up perfectly, and (although don't want to say) I really look forward to the next Hulk movie.",9,4,10,13 June 2008
Up in the Air," A very subtle movie and the deleted scenes made it a truly Oscar winning level movie
","I watched it in cinema and felt like this has one of the greatest screenplays for years, and the performance of the characters are brilliant. The only thing though is that I felt the movie is not completed and there is something missing, not at the ending, but rather something in the process. But that was the feeling before I watched the Bluray version with the deleted scenes, especially the last two sequences. They actually push the movie to something fantastic, and make the story whole and quite arty. The whole story took place in the troubled time, and everything around was casted in a grey sad colour. But at the end it was' family' support, warm, comfort and encourage everybody to get through. But what did Ryan get from all these experience or anything changed to his philosophy and his life? How Nat dealt with the suicide case, would she be in law pursuit trouble? The answer seems to be there, but the movie just did say enough leaving the characters less fullness. The two deleted scenes gave me complete satisfaction on everything. Their running times are every long and in HD quality, well edited. It seems it's just because they need to fit the movie to the cinema rules, so they have to cut the two deleted scenes down, and I'm sure in later DVD and Bluray, there will be the director's extended cut to show the movie as it should be. If you like this movie, make sure you get to watch those deleted scenes, you will be surprised!",9,0,2,1 March 2010
