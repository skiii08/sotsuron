","Well,when you were one of students in the middle school,your teacher asked everyone in the class who has a girlfriend,in China,few persons hold their hand in the air because of shyness.But there is only one classmate did it in our class ,and the teacher praised him.Actually,i guess there must be many other guys regretted not to face the truth.In this movie,you probably think Henry just wanna have sex with Lucy firstly.But in fact,henry isn't let us down,he always keep in love with lucy,with his pure,honesty,or something else's love.He respect his real love and just for fun with his past female partner.So we can make sense that if one fall in love with somebody,not only did sex between them,but there're more else sincerely emotion between them.True love you meet with has just two or three times in your life,just pay more attention to your lover now,to value her,and hope you'll have the final happiness!",7,0,2,26 September 2009
