Marie Antoinette," The Go Gos go to Versailles
","Like many of the other people writing in their comments, this film followed a long day and the need for some solid entertainment. My expectations were really low for this movie and given that Kirsten Dunst was the lead, I knew that the film would potentially misfire. While I have enjoyed her performances in the past, most notably Crazy Beautiful, like many contemporary actresses she just doesn't have the range, yet...Period pieces must above all give you a sense of the moment. In films like Pride and Prejudice (Colin Firth version), The Horseman on the Roof, Elizabeth, etc..., you are pulled into that world, that time period. With this movie, it was like watching a rock opera filmed at a fashion house, with some really wicked catering being provided.I have to admit, I gave up on this move at about 1.5 hours. While I felt guilty leaving my wife to finish this movie (she picked it to begin with), I just didn't feel like giving up precious sleep to watch an ending that I really couldn't care less about seeing.",Null,3,6,17 April 2007
