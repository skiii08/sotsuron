The Avengers," This Film Delivers
","I do not read comics. I've tried, but they just seem like watered-down versions of the shows I watched as a kid, like Batman TAS or Teen Titans.But I love cinema. I've been keeping up with all the Marvel movies released prior to the Avengers and they were always teasing at an Avengers movie. And let me be the one millionth to say...'OH MY GOD, THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!'And what a movie it is. It has comedy, it has action, character interactions, drama, EVERYTHING a movie needs. Not just a comic book film, ANY film. But, when you get down to it, Avengers is a comic book that has been cleanly and perfectly translated to the big screen.But what sets Avengers apart from other movies is the mere fact that it WORKED. Every single character in this has been the leading man in their own movie (or has the potential to be) and yet the film focuses on them all. It's like if you got John Lennon, William Shatner, and George Peppard to be in a movie together with Vincent Price as the villain and the story managed to revolve around ALL of them.The plot is unoriginal, but that's not what carries the movie. What carries the movie is the characters. Even the scenes with Thor, Cap, Iron Man and Nick Fury just TALKING are fun and engaging, and no scene drags or is too fast. And that's all this movie aims to be: an overload of fun.Why are you still reading this? Go rent the movie and watch it, you fool!",9,1,3,5 February 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Prepare yourself for the implausible.
","I love this movie. I never fully understood why people hate this movie so much. Here is why (I will also be speaking a bit about the other two prequels):First off, casting Anakin as a kid was an excellent choice on the part of George Lucas. COME BACK HERE RIGHT NOW! He's much more impressionable as a kid than he would be as a teen or young adult. When everyone in the movie keeps stepping in front of him and forcing him to conform to their way or their point of view, it helps build this feeling of powerlessness which he grows to despise and fear throughout the rest of the trilogy. I mean, he starts off as a slave (already powerless) who wins his freedom from his owner who refuses to let his mother leave with him. He feels powerless because he can't change Watto's mind. He gets attacked by Darth Maul in the desert and must watch Qui-Gon fight him alone. Again, powerless. He must stand and be judged by the robotic Jedi Council, travel with Qui-Gon back to Naboo, is told to stay in the ship lest he get in the way or get hurt, and then finds out that Qui-Gon, the only father figure in his life, was killed and that there was nothing he could've done to prevent it. All throughout his life, he is being railroaded around by all these people who disregard him because they see him as of no consequence, which he hates. This foreshadows how he'll react to finding out that he was too late to save his mother from Tusken brutality, as well as having troubling nightmare's about his wife's impending death: he doesn't want to be powerless.And when he realizes in the third film that it was HE who killed Padme, it's all the more devastating to him because now he actually HAD the power and still couldn't save those he loved FROM HIMSELF. Thus, he becomes the cold-hearted, nihilistic Darth Vader, who cares nothing for his fellow man and will not hesitate to Force choke anyone who screws up.The Jedi Order is portrayed as a bunch of unfeeling automatons who think that emotion leads to the dark side. Thus, they are unable to help Anakin cope with Qui-Gon's loss or that of his mother in the second film, because they don't understand feelings anymore. While this does make them a bit wooden as characters, it helps explain why they weren't able to foresee his betrayal: because they don't FEEL like he does.No comment on Jar Jar. I didn't find him that annoying.Finally, there's the villains. This is where I have my peeves. For one thing, why did Sidious order the Viceroy to KILL the Jedi? Wouldn't that make it harder for his plans to move forward if the only two who could get away were dead? And why did Darth Maul show up at the hanger and not try to stop Padme and her guards from capturing the Viceroy? And why did Darth Maul attack Qui-Gon in the desert? And why did Darth Maul not make his escape instead of fighting a pointless fight scene? I dunno, but I can forgive it because that fight scene gave us Duel of the Fates and a double-ended lightsaber.",8,4,5,7 December 2013
The Expendables 2," What Happened?
","Let me start by saying that I liked the Expendables. In fact, I just finished writing a review for it. It was well-paced, had excellent escalation, and the characters were so clichéd that I HAD to love them.Then I heard all the hype around Expendables 2 and checked it out, and frankly... It's a lot weaker. Gone is the weight of the characters' past discrepancies or the drama that Robert Vaughn brought to the first movie. While Van Damme made a great villain despite his mediocre acting abilities, there was something about ex-CIA Agent Monroe that made him feel a lot more threatening. Every time Vaughn was on the screen, I felt like he was saying, 'Yeah, I'm so badass that I don't even need to get involved in all this.' When Van Damme is on, I'm constantly reminded that he's not a fear-mongering mastermind, but a less ethical merc than Stallone. And, come on, 'Vilain'? His name is 'VILAIN'?!Chuck Norris is a terrible actor. I can't even pin down what his character's personality was like in this or any other project he worked on. I'm convinced the only reason he made it into this film was because of all those bullcrap Chuck Norris facts which, after seeing Chuck Norris's performance, leave me baffled as to why he's so popular. Charlie McCarthy's acting was less wooden!Worst of all is the escalation. Yhe first movie started with a basic gunfight and ended with a giant, over-the-top blow-'em-up against an inferior foe, just like an '80s movie, whereas the sequel starts with a giant, over-the-top driving-motorcycles-into-helicopters-because-who-gives-a-crap blow-'em-up and ends with a basic gunfight at an airport, with not one explosion to be seen. I understand that it's an '80s action movie and that the characters are invincible, but when you establish your bad guys as legit threats and then have the heroes gun them down without even looking for cover, it really kills my investment. That and all the 'comedic' references to the actors' past works really annoyed me.If this is the style to which Expendables 3 is made, I don't think I'm going to go see it. Ah, who am I kidding? OF COURSE I'm going to go see it. But I'll be going with a due sense of exhaustion and dread, especially if they get another 'comedic' director.Now, if they put Bruce Campbell or Mr. T in it, however...",4,0,0,12 March 2014
The Expendables," Take a Hint, Michael Bay
","THIS is how one makes a soulless action movie: by taking a cast of likable and somewhat clichéd group of characters who are in to Creedence Clearwater Revival and put them through increasingly unforgiving gunfights.But the Expendables isn't soulless. There are some moments that you can see the weight of the characters' pasts when they talk about some of the horrible sheit they've been through. There's a very subtle love interest for Stallone's character, Barney Ross, which never kisses him, fawns over him, or tries to sleep with him. The most they share is a hug at the very end.All of the action celebrities are more or less playing culminations of their various roles in the past, none of which have believable names. But, to be honest, you probably won't care about their names because there is WAY too much crap trying to kill them for you to care.This is probably the most '80s action movie I've ever seen. It makes the action scenes bigger and bigger and the characters more and more clichéd until you have one giant testosterone-fueled explosion of one-liners and, um, explosions.Seriously, it's awesome.",7,0,0,12 March 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," I Doubt Five Armies Can Top This Film
","Yes, I read the Hobbit. Yes, I read the Lord of the Rings. No, I don't like how Legolas was shoehorned into this movie. Anyway...What I mean in the title is that this film is probably the most memorable out of all the Hobbit movies thus far. We have Azhog the White Orc being badass as usual, Ian McKellan turns in a great performance like he always does, and they even sneak Steven Fry into a bit role that has his fingerprints all over the writing. But by far the most memorable moment is the Triumph of the Whirling Barrel Dervish. Those of you who see the film know what I'm talking about.Never have I seen something so cartoonishly over-the-top in a Tolkein film before. It made everyone in the audience laugh at how utterly ridiculous it was, and it really helped set this movie above from its predecessor as well as the original Lord of the Rings films. Yes, those films were great, but I don't find them especially memorable the way I do this movie.I feel the elements introduced into the film that weren't in the book work to the film's advantage. The love interest between Tauriel and the dwarf whose name I can't remember helped set him apart from the rest of the dwarfs, though, again, I REALLY wish they'd left Legolas out of the film. All this does is set up either a tragic death or all of us rolling our eyes because Legolas or the dwarf is going to get stiffed. No one likes seeing their ship sunk, Peter Jackson.So, yeah, love this film to death, because this is where I really feel that the fantasy adventure starts to simultaneously take itself more seriously but also less seriously. It remembers that fantasy doesn't need to be based in reality and occasionally throws in a bit of bombastic silliness to make sure we remember that too. It's not perfect, but there was never a moment I didn't enjoy. I instead look to Five Armies to fulfill that obligation.",7,1,5,29 May 2014
The Little Mermaid," It's... Eh, alright.
","While this IS the movie that started the Disney Renaissance, I feel that it was more due to the animation than the riveting story or characters.First, the Good: the animation is spectacular. Why they switched from this to whatever was used in Pocahontas and Hunchback will always be a mystery to me because it is BEAUTIFUL. The songs are pretty good, though I've always found Part of Your World to be a bit, um, 'whiney'. Under the Sea is good, and Poor Unfortunate Souls is also good. Kiss the Girl WAS good until it was bastardized by female pop singers like Selena Gomez. Since then, it just hasn't been the same.Then the Bad: a lot of scenes in this movie are rather boring. Maybe it's because I have a Y-chromosome, but I never found Ariel fawning over Eric or King Triton blowing his top to be that enjoyable. Again, the musical numbers are fun, but the scenes between them aren't very memorable in terms of dialogue and events, excluding the climax and that one scene of Ariel combing her hair with a fork.Now, the Ugly: I never realized it before, but I can totally sympathize with people who hate Ariel. Why? Because she essentially sells her 'voice' to the underwater version of the Devil in exchange for a shot at a getting guy. She does nothing to really help anyone else throughout the movie and doesn't spend much time thinking about things other than herself, boys, and human trinkets. At the end she gets her father turned into a... plant-fish-thing? And, despite all the trouble her raging teenage hormones have caused, she still gets what she wants.THAT'S not a harmful message at all! If you enjoy the movie, fine, I can easily see why: it's a very colorful, very beautiful film. But in my opinion, it doesn't hold up against other Disney films like Aladdin, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, or The Great Mouse Detective, who may lack stunning visuals but more than make up for it in story and characters, especially the latter.",6,1,6,20 February 2014
Transformers," Should've been called 'Shia LaBeouf feat. The Transformers'
","Transformers is a franchise that was born out of the need to make money. And yet, it grew beyond being just another '80s toy marketing scheme into it's own distinct universe and tone. It had a soul. It was one of those things where all you had to do was take one look at it and go, 'That's Transformers.' But this movie has no soul. It does not revolve around Optimus Prime and the Autobots fighting a (somehow) covert war against the Decepticons. No, this movie revolves around the adventures of Shia LaBeouf and his Styrofoam-bland girlfriend Megan Fox getting in over their heads and delivering exposition.Now, I know what you're thinking: 'It's got the giant robots in it, and that's all I need.' Well, you know how in the cartoons there's always an explosion of color whenever sheit goes down, accompanied by kick-ass music? Yeah, this movie, and ALL of Bay's Transformers movies, have none of that. The fights take place in this eerie silence and all of the unique colors of both the Autobots and the Decepticons are lost under a pile of chrome. The Transformers themselves are unrecognizable aside from Optimus and the sound of the Transformers changing from vehicles to bots always made my skin crawl.'Soulless'... Yeah, that's a good way to sum up these movies.",3,0,4,12 February 2014
Big Hero 6," An Otherwise Perfect Movie Marred by Disney Feel-Good Contrivances
","Now, let me say that I am a HUGE Disney fan. Two of my Top 4 favorite films (Muppet Treasure Island at #1 and The Great Mouse Detective at #3) are both fun Disney family films that I happily watch again and again. I feel that Disney's film quality has dipped a bit since they went entirely the 3D animation, but I still think they put out great stuff. Anyway...I didn't give this much thought when I first saw the trailers. Ever since I was so horribly disappointed by Muppets Most Wanted, I made a rule not to go see a movie unless its trailer got me interested. Big Hero 6's trailer did not.However, after hearing all the positive reception it was getting, I finally decided to go see it no more than two hours ago at my local college theater. And, for the most part, this reception was well- warranted.All of the characters are likable and memorable, which is the essential part of making a movie work: if no one likes your characters, no one will care what happens to them and therefore no one will care about your story. Baymax and Fred, who are easily my favorite characters for how lovably awkward Baymax is and how much of a fanboy Fred is, are probably the best of the cast. I can relate to both, and I love just how mindlessly optimistic Fred is about everything he does, even when he's in immediate danger.The story is pretty simple: Hiro suffers a tragic loss, wants to apprehend those responsible, and recruits his friends to help him. Like the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the story's nothing special, but you came for the characters, so it's adequate.However, what's NOT adequate are two of the most bullsheit Disney 'bad things don't happen here' decisions I have ever seen.SPOILERS BEGIN HERE.The first comes during the climactic battle with the main villain, who is out for revenge after his daughter was sucked into a wormhole machine. As the wormhole machine starts to collapse in on itself, a scan from Baymax reveals the daughter is still alive within the pocket dimension of the wormhole 'in hypersleep'. WHAT?! First of all, this revelation comes completely out of nowhere. It was never set up, 'hypersleep' was never even mentioned during the movie, and as such it comes off like Disney didn't have the balls to leave a tinge of sadness in their movie. And they had the groundwork laid out so well! It was never said outright that the daughter was dead, per say, so that ambiguity could've been enough to warrant the villain being sympathetic. But, no, can't have ANYTHING bad happen in a superhero movie, right?This leads to the next bit of asinine Disney bullsheit. While Baymax and Hiro (who didn't build a superpowered science suit for himself some reason) try to escape the wormhole, Baymax's thrusters get damaged and he is forced to sacrifice himself via Rocket Fist in order to get Hiro out of the wormhole at the cost of his own escape. This, you'd think, would be a very tragic but also perfect way to cap off Baymax's arc throughout the movie, right? WRONG! As it turns out, Baymax was somehow able to eject his hard drive with all his programming on it (without us seeing him do it) during the time he was dodging debris and pushing a pod inside the wormhole. When I saw him drift off, I was pretty saddened despite being miffed about the previous hypersleep contrivance. Then, this new contrivance slaps us in the face since Disney never allows any kind of bittersweet ending to its movies (*cough* Muppet Treasure Island *cough*). Plus, it makes Baymax's final farewell completely nonsensical, since by the movie's own logic, Baymax should not care about Hiro's wellbeing, having ejected that part of his programming. Stupid Disney executives...But the last bit that was distractingly off-putting in this movie was when Hiro first has a shot at catching the bad guy, and he tells Baymax to kill him.I'm sorry, WHAT?! I know he's torn up about his tragic loss, but this seems so out-of-character for him. He always came off as a tragic but still energetic character. Him acting so blood-hungry came out of nowhere. It was never foreshadowed or built up to, he just suddenly wants the villain's head on a spike. And I know the villain kind of pushed him to it when he hits Hiro with the 'Too bad, so sad, who cares?' bit about his loss, but that still doesn't excuse Hiro from lowering himself to the villain's level just so the movie can draw parallels between him and the villain during the climax.SPOILERS END HEREWith all that said, I still think this is a good movie with plenty of potential for sequels. I'm just glad they didn't try to push another movie in their post-credits scene.On that, I would've rated this movie a star lower, but thanks to Big Hero 6, STAN LEE IS NOW OFFICIALLY A Disney CHARACTER. WOOHOO!",8,2,8,24 January 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Why All This Hate I'm Seeing? Age of Ultron was GREAT!
","Let's get something straight: the first Avengers movie was not the pinnacle of geek fantasy that everyone seems to remember it was. It has issues with its pacing in the first act, Loki and the Ch'Taari never amount to more than an army for the Avengers to fight, and the entire climax was bloated and overlong with only three changes to the status quo: the portal opening, the nuke, and the portal closing. If anything, THIS movie elevates the Ch'Taari to something bigger than 'the bad guys'.I think that everyone is starting to see those flaws in Age of Ultron, as the movie has those same flaws. But that doesn't mean Age of Ultron isn't a great film. So this will be less of a review and more a counter-argument to the most common complaints.'There's a lack of character development'. Wrong. Hawkeye is made more interesting and 3-dimensional, Tony Stark has a revelation about how vulnerable the Earth is which puts his view of it and the cosmos into a whole new perspective, Black Widow's relationship with the Hulk is further developed, Widow's backstory is fleshed out more, and the Twins (who I don't think are ever referred to by their superhero names) go through an arc of their own (which I won't spoil). Besides, let's not forget that Tony's arc in the first movie basically amounted to going from, 'Uh, his first name is 'Agent'' to 'His name was Phil' and that Hawkeye didn't even get an arc.'There are too many jokes.' It's a Marvel movie directed by Joss Whedon, what was everyone expecting? Nolan's schlock? When a scene wanted to be dramatic, it was dramatic. When a scene was supposed to be lighter, the characters made quips. No one made any jokes when they were defending the control rod from Ultron, or when they were debating over the possible nature of The Vision (you know, the red-faced blue-eyed guy from the trailers?).'It's the same as the last one.' Actually, it's not. The first one was a big, dumb comic book movie that brought four different franchises together for a massive crossover, and the movie itself had little to do with its predecessors outside of one line from Nick Fury.Age of Ultron is also a big crossover, but with a villain who makes a lot of philosophical observations about the nature of existence and what he perceives to be the human race's stagnancy, thereby making him the good guy in his own eyes. The movie even starts where Cap 2: The Winter Soldier left off, with the whole Avengers team assembled to eradicate what's left of HYDRA. And Tony never said he was going anywhere at the end of Iron Man 3. Sheesh, you REALLY thought that Mr. Genius Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist was going to give up being a superhero with HIS ego?Really, the only complaint I have with the film is James Spader's performance as Ultron. He could've been a lot funnier or a lot more threatening, and for some reason Joss decided to go halfway, leaving us with an Ultron who's definitely interesting and unsympathetic, but not very compelling in his own right. Ultron could've still been funny if his humor had been unintentional, and I could easily see all of his scenes being rewritten to keep the jokes without sacrificing his threat factor. Alas, twas not to be.Besides, we all know Tom Kane would've OWNED Ultron, am I right?There is a moment where both times I saw this movie in two different theaters I heard the entire audience collectively gasp, a moment which I dare not spoil because of how mind-blowing it is. Go see Age of Ultron so that you may experience that moment.",9,6,15,21 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not a Perfect Way to End the Franchise, but a Good One
","If they had ended the movies here, I would've been satisfied. While the Phantom Menace may have suffered from confusing villains and a story that was more aimed at setting up future installments than being good and Attack of the Clones was a steaming pile blaster-riddled bantha fodder, Revenge of the Sith finally got its act together and gave us a proper Star Wars story.Now, if you are one of the few that HAVEN'T seen this movie, either out of ignorance or because you saw RedLetterMedia's nitpicky review of it, here's the synopsis: it opens with stuff happening, stuff happens throughout the film, and it closes with the stuff that happens in A New Hope beginning to happen. And most of that stuff is dark, as in darker-than-Empire-Strikes-Back dark. This is the film where we finally see Anakin go from the whiny teenager that no one seems to understand (except me, it seems) to Darth Vader.My one and only complaint about the movie is some of the dialogue. Anakin and Padme have some love-banter halfway in that REALLY hurts, and some of the things that the Clones do isn't properly addressed.I don't think it's fair to complain about the acting, since the Jedi have more or less been portrayed as a bunch of unfeeling automatons at this point anyway (again, catering to setup rather than telling a good story). Obi-Wan seems to have maintained his humanity throughout the ordeals, and as usual Palpatine is delightfully diabolical. Anakin's power deprivation finally reaches a boiling point and once again Christopher Lee as Count Dooku doesn't get nearly enough screen time.Despite all that, I still agree with the 87% of critics who think this movie is worth rewatching. At the very least if gives you some insight into the man in the Darth Vader mask.",9,2,3,18 May 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Blegh
","When I heard Bane was going to be in the last movie, naturally I was hyped. I mean, he's my favorite comic book movie villain of all time. What could possibly go wrong? EVERYTHING! This movie is full of dumbass moments, poorly executed plot and Bane is wearing Darth Vader's crotch piece for some reason. WHY?! Say what you want about Joel Schumacher's Batman and Robin, but at least THAT movie had Bane in his natural form, even if he was a retarded gorilla-monkey.The plot to this movie starts off strong, with Not-Bane clearly making it known to us that he is a terrorist and he means business. Bruce Wayne has stopped being Batman and now sports a leg injury and cane, even though Christian Bale looks way to young to be the Batman from Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns. He decides to be Batman again after an also too young Anne Hathaway steals his fingerprints and...I can't recall the plot to this movie. All I remember is sitting in the theater with the same bad feeling in my gut that I had when I sat through M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs'. It was only after I checked out reviews of the Dark Knight Rises that everyone pointed out the same problem that Signs had: all the plot holes. How did Batman recover from being mauled by Not-Bane in a few days and yet take years to recover from a leg injury? If Not-Bane is going to blow up the city, why give the trigger to some random civilian? Because that random civilian turns out to be Talia al-Ghul! BUM Bum bummmm...STUPID! Talia was given no development outside of sleeping with Bruce Wayne (hey, isn't Catwoman supposed to be in this movie?) and that's it. If you're going to have a twist, movie, you need to establish elements within said twist before you execute it, like *SPOILERS FOR ANYONE WHO HASN'T SEEN 'FROZEN' YET* Prince Hans being established as a nice guy and turning out to be a huge douche. Oh, that scene was glorious...Another problem is that this movie suffers from the absence of Batman. Instead, we get Batman's mentally challenged cousin Crazy Steve (who made his debut in All-Star Batman and Robin #1) who gets tricked into a trap by Anne Hathaway and then has the buhjesus beaten out of him by Not-Bane. GOOD; he deserved it after All-Star BAR.Overall, this is NOT a fitting end to Nolan's Dark Knight movies. It suffers from major plot holes and poorly executed story elements, as well as Crazy Steve being an amateur when it comes to things like thought. The only two good things going for it are Not-Bane, who is still very enjoyable despite his lack of luchador masks, and the fights in broad daylight, in which we get to see Crazy Steve get mashed up in full splendor. Ah, it's the little things that make me happy, unlike this giant piece of crap.",3,2,5,20 February 2014
Click," I Have No Idea What I Just Watched, But I Liked It
","This movie isn't sure what it wants to be. There are too many comedic moments for it to be a drama but the drama occupies the second half of the movie, so it can't be a comedy.Whatever this movie is, I'm glad I watched it. All the trailers painted this movie as a big 'What If' scenario played up for laughs, so I didn't see it when it first came out. It looked a little too stupid and nonsensical. But, there comes a time when your so bored, and no one is around to witness it, that you will give the stupid and nonsensical a try.So I walked in, I saw all the bits from the trailers, and then the movie suddenly became 'It's A Wonderful Life', only protagonist Michael Newman (it's Adam Sandler; like, the same Adam Sandler we got with every early 2000s Happy Madison movie) is stuck in this brave new world that he sacrificed his entire life for with no hope of ever turning it back.My one complaint about the movie is that the ending is a bit of a cop-out, but they patch it up pretty well thanks to a few heartfelt words from Christopher Walken.Suffice to say, I was pretty surprised when this movie went from being an okay Adam Sandler comedy to a tearful message not to let your life go by; to live in every moment of it; that it's an expression of joy, and that if you take it seriously, you're gonna lose. It's funny, it's well written, it's well paced, it's well acted, it's just a great movie.",9,0,0,22 April 2014
Aladdin," One of my Favorite Movies of All Time
","Maybe it's just because I have a serious case of ADHD, but I LOVE this movie. I love everything it has in it. I love the animation. I love Jafar's slimy personality. I love how annoying Gilbert Goddfried was as Iago. I love the chemistry between Princess Jasmine and Aladdin. I love how much personality Frank Welker brought to Abu with zero dialog. And I absolutely LOVE Robin Williams as the Genie. I think he's the best celebrity casting choice since they got Vincent Price to play Ratigan in The Great Mouse Detective (great movie, by the way).The story isn't that original, but let's face it, no one watched Aladdin for the story. They watched it for all that stuff I mentioned. And even though they added a lot of pop cultural references to the Genie's dialog that are a bit dated, you really don't need to know what they're referencing to enjoy the character. The Rocky Balboa reference in 'Friend Like Me' doesn't detract from the song, neither does Williams' impersonation of Jack Nicholson when he's trying to talk Aladdin into telling Jasmine the truth about himself. They're just there long enough so that if you get them, you will, and if you don't get them, you won't mind, because the Genie's just such an enjoyable character.Give this film a watch if you haven't already. It's easily one of the most entertaining Disney's ever done.",10,2,3,12 February 2014
