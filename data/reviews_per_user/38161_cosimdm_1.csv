Walk the Line," fake poverty scenes
","It seems to me the maker's of the movie didn't do their homework about Cash's background. If they wanted to depict Cash as being poor as a youngster, they would not put in the following: painted sharecropper house- no one in that situation lived in a freshly painted house. They lived in tar paper shacks. Cash's house looked even better than the house Richard Nixon drew up in in Whittier. Poor boys then did NOT have fresh barbershop haircuts. Their mothers cut their hair. Also, the clothes the boy's wore looked totally fake- no mends, tears, or dirt. The other thing that got me was that some of the characters- June and those who played John's parents never aged in the movie. Except for his mother's hair style, they looked the same from beginning to end.",5,3,12,22 November 2005
