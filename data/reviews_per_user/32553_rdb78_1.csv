The Blair Witch Project," A strange,little thing called movie
","Speaking of substance,'The Blair Witch Project' is not a representation,because it doesn't 'represent' anything;but it's not a documentary,for the evident reason that it doesn't 'document' anything real. Speaking of form,it would be a 'documentary-movie' and that's the reason of its incredible success:the innovation. Now the only chance you have to see it as an innovation consists in the complete suspension of disbelief and here come the bad news:the collision between what you know as real and what you know as fiction,regarding the depicted facts,leaves the truth behind:without reality,suggestions,allegories or any other narrative characteristic,all you have is a shopping list. Here we don't have neither the fear of what's unknown as in 'Evil dead',nor the fear of 'whose blood gonna spill now?' as in any splatter film you get. And,above all,not the fear of 'what is evil and how could it manifest?' as in a masterpiece like 'The exorcist'. No comparison,please.",1,0,2,23 February 2000
