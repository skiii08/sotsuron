Vertigo," Style and substance; Kim Novak plays herself
","As an amateur student of film, I am fascinated by how movies (in America as well as in foreign countries) capture the imagination and become commercially and critically successful. I have come to conclude that European films rely primarily on substance (with the exception of Fellini, who went for style), whereas American filmmakers will push style over substance almost all the time. Very rarely does a filmmaker manage to achieve a harmonious balance of style and substance. One good example is the American director George Lucas (STAR WARS). Another example is the American (though British by birth) director Alfred Hitchcock (VERTIGO).VERTIGO was not my first Hitchcock film. I had previously seen I CONFESS, which really didn't affect me that much (probably because it was in black and white, and I think most films are much more dramatically intense in color). I sat down to watch VERTIGO not knowing what to expect. I understood part of the plot, if not all of it. Therefore, I was surprised by what I didn't understand as well as delighted by what I did understand.I enjoyed the film. It is a journey into the neurotic mind of John Ferguson (James Stewart), a San Francisco detective who suffers from a chronic fear of heights. He retires from the police force, only to be called upon by an old friend to undertake one last case. This case concerns the friend's wife (Kim Novak), who is believed to be insane. John begins to shadow his quarry through San Francisco, gradually becoming obsessed with her. And that's just the beginning...I mentioned earlier that VERTIGO is a blend of style and substance, and Hitchcock truly does artfully mix the two into a coherent whole. VERTIGO cannot be pigeonholed, being equal parts detective story, romance, and psychological thriller. The movie is slow at times (which is actually quite crucial to the plot), but on other occasions it explodes with blasts of the colorful and the avant-garde. The most striking of these is a bizarre dream sequence that becomes completely abstract and is totally at odds with anything else in the film. And then, of course, there is Hitchcock's innovative method for capturing the 'vertigo' effect - backing the camera away from the action while at the same time deploying the zoom lens.But the movie's real strengths lie in its performers. Jimmy Stewart displays his excellent range by puncturing his George Bailey stereotype from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and running in the opposite direction, portraying a fey character who is both sympathetic and frightening. The real star, however, is Kim Novak. I have never seen her in any other movie, but I am convinced of her talent just from watching this one. In effect, she plays herself - an actress who can become anyone in order to confuse and torment. She is like a normal woman at some points, and then at other times she becomes strangely inhuman - silent and enigmatic. In fact, in this two-hour movie Kim Novak does not actually speak until the film is one-third over.VERTIGO was a powerful experience for me. It did not actually scare me (as PSYCHO probably would), but it did disturb me a bit and made me realize how emotionally unstable a lot of seemingly complacent human beings are. It is, first and foremost, a chilling thriller, and the love story is actually a wonderful bonus. Plus, it depicts the one-of-a-kind beauty of the vistas of San Francisco the way no other movie ever has. I give VERTIGO three and a half stars (only because it just wasn't every bit as powerful as it could have been). It truly deserves its place among the greatest films of all time.",Null,1,2,19 August 2000
Casablanca," I can see why this film is so well-loved...
","Rick Blaine is perhaps one of the greatest movie characters I've ever had the pleasure of getting to know. Why? Simply because he's not perfect. At certain points in the film he perfectly embodies the cynic, the grouch, the moral coward, even the jerk. But the fact is, almost every human being who ever lived has been capable of cynical, grouchy, or cowardly behavior - and yes, all of us have been jerks at one time or another. You see, CASABLANCA is about much more than just intrigue and romance during World War II. It's about a selfish man who overcomes his self-hatred and finds the long-dormant goodness at his core. It's about overcoming obstacles and making amends for past wrongs, about rejoining the human race and rediscovering idealism. I watched this movie last night on DVD following a family Christmas party, and Humphrey Bogart made the perfect Grinch. But instead of stealing Christmas, Bogie ended up stealing victory from the jaws of the Nazis - and stealing our sympathy as well. I will never forget CASABLANCA.",Null,0,0,17 December 2001
Erin Brockovich," Maltin-style review
","Entertaining portrait of real-life legal assistant Erin Brockovich, who took on Central California's corrupt utility mavens and emerged triumphant. Julia Roberts brings the populist heroine to delightful life, and Albert Finney is engaging as Ed Masry. Beautiful photography of California's San Joaquin Valley. Look for the real McCoy in a small role as a waitress.",Null,0,0,16 August 2000
Batman Returns," A thrill ride from start to finish
","Very rarely do movie sequels ever match the grandeur of the originals. BATMAN RETURNS however, does so with gusto. The sequel to 1989's BATMAN, BATMAN RETURNS neither milks the success of the first movie nor totally disregards it; it's a wonderful sequel and a spectacular movie in its own right. There's something for everyone in this movie - humor, high drama, plenty of action, and lots of cool things to look at. Of course, viewers have to get around Tim Burton's morbid and sometimes offensive sense of humor, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem in this era of SOUTH PARK and THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. While the movie has many great moments, it also has its flaws. The plot seems rushed, stitched together. Danny DeVito tries his best as the Penguin but doesn't quite pull it off. Christopher Walken appears as a secondary bad guy, but his performance is lackluster compared to the others. And many of the action sequences, though breathtaking, seemed forced and are occasionally absurd. All that aside, there's all kinds of surprises in this movie - smart humor and dialogue, characters you can't help but love, lots of satire (Homer's Iliad, CITIZEN KANE, and the American political scene are all lampooned), and many memorable scenes that only serve as a testament to Burton's colorful imagination. I hope to get this movie on DVD, where I can enjoy it on my big screen TV in all its glory. Not exactly the best Batman film ever, but still a fascinating movie to watch over and over again.",Null,74,157,25 September 1999
Batman Returns," Maltin-style review
","Very rarely do movie sequels ever match the grandeur of the originals. Tim Burton's BATMAN RETURNS, however, does so with gusto. Hardly standing on the shoulders of its record-breaking 1989 predecessor, this mesmerizing blend of Gothicism, film noir, and cartoon chaos is a classic in its own right. High drama, uncompromising humor, and lots of cool things to look at highlight this tale of Batman's war against The Penguin, Catwoman, and a fascist businessman (Christopher Walken). Not even a shaky plot, some absurd set-pieces, and Burton's trademark perversity (much worse here than in many of his other films) seriously mar this wildly original movie that should prove once and for all that superheroes aren't just for kids.",Null,0,0,24 January 2001
Forrest Gump," Ma nime's Forse, Forse Guh-uhmp...
","FORREST GUMP was a much more enjoyable experience for me when I was a boy. I thought it was a wonderful, magical tale about taking life slow and easy. But now I am older, and I see it as little more than an overlong showcase of clich√©s in which Tom Hanks talks in an embarrassing Southern drawl and plays a cardboard caricature.I admire Forrest for the good old boy that he is; unfortunately, that's ALL he is. If you will pardon the hyperbole, our mentally retarded hero is so pure and innocent and decent and good-hearted that he makes Jimmy Stewart's character in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE look like a child pornographer. Whether he's the knight in shining armor protecting girlfriend Jenny from any menace; the selfless warrior rescuing all his comrades in the heat of battle; or the pious Christian whose faith remains fervent even as Lieutenant Dan Taylor curses God, Forrest Gump never does anything morally questionable.In addition, throughout the film Gump displays an 'idiot savant' personality type that really gets on my nerves. Now I know that some autistic people are blessed with highly unusual skills, but it is simply not feasible that Forrest is perfect at everything he does. He runs faster, plays better ping-pong, assembles a rifle quicker, is more successful in the business world, and in general proves to be a whiz at almost everything through a combination of freakish talent and dumb luck.Not to be insensitive, but I think Gump had it pretty swell. After miraculously overcoming a childhood infirmity (really!) by busting the braces on his legs through sheer willpower, Forrest has an infinite string of good luck while all of his friends and loved ones either die painful deaths, surrender to their personal demons, or become human vegetables. These are the characters we should feel sorry for, and not Forrest Gump.If Gump had been plagued with at least ONE character flaw - alcoholism, for instance, or some kind of sexual disorder - then maybe I would find it easier to sympathize with him and rejoice in his many accomplishments. As it is, however, Hanks's character is hopelessly squeaky-clean.Which is not to say that FORREST GUMP is an inherently bad movie. It's fine, I suppose, if you like simpleminded morality plays. For the more cynical among us, however, GUMP is just too gummy.",Null,3,6,26 September 2002
Grease," OK, one eentsy-beentsy little problem...
","I first saw this movie when I was ten, but it wasn't until I was about 15 or 16 that I was old enough to really appreciate it. You know, going to high school in 1959, in the long run, wasn't really that different from going to high school in 1997 (when I went), so I enjoyed the movie and could identify with the characters. One thing I hated about it though: why does almost everyone look like twentysomethings with godlike physiques? The truth is that most high school boys are gangly creatures with bad acne and embarrassing falsetto voices, while many girls at that age are stunted, awkward midgets with pillarlike legs. Heck, there are even college students who fit these descriptions. Oh well, I guess that's the beauty of cinematic license. I love GREASE and hope to see it on stage someday.",Null,1,1,1 September 2000
Apocalypse Now," Great, but what was the point?
","Marlon Brando is a legend. I loved him in all three movies I've seen that feature him (THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, and of course this one). Brando steals the scene (hell, he steals the entire movie!) near the end, but what exactly was the point of this muddled quagmire that critics for some reason like to call a masterpiece? As I understand it, the movie was filmed even before the final draft of the script was complete. And it shows - the movie is mostly episodic: Willard (Martin Sheen) learns of his assignment to 'terminate' Kurtz, nuking of Vietnamese villagers, tiger attack, USO girls, trip down the river, and finally the confrontation with Kurtz and his minions. These scenes play a little like short subjects and are weakly linked by Willard's narration. I watched this movie in order to prepare to write an analysis of its content and style and to judge whether it accurately adapted Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness.' The adaptation is only superficial. Conrad's novel was about imperialism and race relations in the jungles of Africa, while APOCALYPSE NOW was about patriotism and desertion in the jungles of Vietnam. Both the novel and the movie do explore the theme of an individual's morality versus that of the 'civilized' world, but I don't think the theme comes across that way. What exactly made Colonel Kurtz go insane? The horrors of war? Ethical qualms about killing innocent people? Agent Orange? The movie never fully explains the circumstances of his psychosis, though we do see that he has become disillusioned with America's supposedly good intentions in Vietnam. And why must Willard kill him? Sure, Kurtz went AWOL and violated military policy, but was he really a menace? Has he become a martyr to the cause of a greater morality that neither Willard nor anyone else can understand? Once again, the movie never explains that fully. All that aside, the movie is soul-stirring and exhilirating. You can see Coppola's bitter attitude toward the Vietnam War coming out in every scene: the mock glorification of wartime butchery with the 'Ride of the Valkyries' theme; the incompetence of the U.S. military, the powerful scene where Willard shoots a woman, having to choose between duty and morality - the scenes obviously show that the director had a lot he wanted to say. And then there's Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando with stygian candor. His iron grip on his band of Cambodian guerrillas is intriguing in a frightening way, and I loved the penultimate scene (though I didn't exactly comprehend it), where Willard stabs Kurtz several times while the footage is intercut with the sight of a water buffalo being slaughtered. As the movie ends, Willard and his one surviving partner leave Kurtz's jungle fortress, as Kurtz's last words ('The horror! The horror!') echo eerily in the distance. Willard has fulfilled his mission, but what has he really accomplished? Is civilization really safe once the Kurtzes of the world are gone? Or is there a greater evil, the one that drove Kurtz insane in the first place? The audience is left to determine this independently. Despite its flaws, the film is memorable and captivating. The jungle imagery is both beautiful and forbidding, and Jim Morrison provides just the right touch by singing various haunting songs throughout the narrative. APOCALYPSE NOW is an excellent movie. I just wish it wasn't so murky (in more ways than one!).",Null,0,0,2 October 1999
The Sixth Sense," A lesson in fear
","THE SIXTH SENSE is a dramatic lesson in fear that borrows heavily from 19th-century literature (especially the stream-of-consciousness technique pioneered by Victorian writer Ambrose Bierce). A truly powerful masterpiece, it accomplishes its objective without gratuitous violence or gore and with only a little nudity and swearing. Yet the fear factor itself is raw and mesmerizing enough to scare you - if you allow yourself to be scared. Taking a break from playing the action hero is Bruce Willis, who portrays a child psychologist with a dark secret of which even he is unaware. Haley Joel Osment is a delightfully unconventional little boy who lives in a tent, speaks fluent Latin, and plays with toy soldiers in church. He also can communicate directly with 'dead people' (i.e. ghosts). The movie juxtaposes the real world and the land of the dead in a casual manner that just adds to the suspense. And as I said before, it is all done very subtly and without a lot of sickening blood or violence. THE SIXTH SENSE will surely go down in history, along with PULP FICTION, BRAVEHEART, AMERICAN BEAUTY, and FARGO as one of the greatest films of the 1990s. So see this movie soon. It will terrify you - and restore your faith in the motion picture industry.",Null,0,0,21 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," May it live forever
","Only a few movies in cinema's 100-plus year history have become immortal in the way that this movie has, and even then there are few films that have captured the imagination with such √©lan. People all over the world have said in so many different ways what makes STAR WARS so great, but the greatest thing that can be said about it is that there will never be anything like it for all time. The story resonates for people in every culture and of every generation. George Lucas can proudly take his place among such literary titans as Homer, Shakespeare, and Dickens. His 1977 movie is a myth not just for the 20th century, but for all perpetuity. May STAR WARS live forever.",Null,0,0,25 September 1999
Braveheart," Maltin-style review
","A robust and inspiring masterpiece about Scottish farmer William Wallace (Mel Gibson), who overcame personal tragedy to rise to the ranks of leadership in the Scottish rebellion against England. The general atmosphere becomes a little melodramatic at times, but overall this is a passionate tribute to anyone, anywhere in the world, who has ever risked all for the ultimate prize of freedom. Perfect for those who wish to experience the full range of human heroics, emotions, atrocities, and victories in one movie.",Null,0,1,25 February 2002
Gladiator," I hated, hated, HATED this movie
","I love ancient epics. Who doesn't? I grew up watching Kevin Sorbo's 'Hercules' TV series and was captivated by it, and I also enjoyed BEN-HUR and JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS. These films worked because they treated the civilizations of Greece and Rome with the utmost respect.So when I first heard about Russell Crowe's new movie GLADIATOR I was on fire to see it. I couldn't wait to sit in the theater and watch Crowe battle tigers and armored monsters with swords.But the movie left me cold, and in retrospect I should have expected as much. Director Ridley Scott (of BLADE RUNNER and the ALIEN films) projects his usual bleak palette on the screen here. For a movie about a glorious regime that supposedly brought light to what was then the known world, GLADIATOR seems so dark and gloomy. Plus, the story is anything but a whimsical joy ride; it's a bitter revenge-fest. After finding that his wife and son have been murdered, the Roman general Maximus (Crowe) is sold into slavery and becomes an angry, violent gladiator. The whole point of the plot is that he must find the man who wronged him - Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the new emperor of Rome - and take his revenge.I'm sorry, but I never knew anger and vengeance were such crucial elements in the Roman epic. As Maximus, Crowe broods and seethes throughout the entire production and manages to suck most of the fun out of the audience. Even the rousing gladiator battles (which took up less screen time than I'd hoped) did little to pique my interest. I tried to get myself to sympathize with Maximus, but I just couldn't. He didn't have a screen presence, unless you count hacking things to bits to be a presence.I also loathed the film's villain, played by a pale, dark-eyed Joaquin Phoenix. Movie villains are supposed to enjoy their time on screen, but Commodus just whines and moans his way to an anticlimactic death no decent villain deserves. If you have a lackluster hero in a movie, you should at least try to make the villain interesting. Not so here. Commodus seems more like an annoying teenager than a ruler, and his only fascinating quirk is the supposed feelings of lust he has for his sister. Their 'sex scene' together isn't really much of anything, doesn't go anywhere, and left me feeling nauseated and a bit creeped out.With such insufferably insipid characters I was forced to concentrate on the film's only two positive qualities: the stunning vistas (they are grand) and the fight choreography. Unfortunately, there isn't enough action in this so-called action movie to really get excited about. The few fight scenes are shot with manic camera angles that would be more at home in a music video. And the ultimate battle scene at the end, which by definition should be the best of the bunch, quickly fizzles out like a wet firecracker.Pointless, nasty, nihilistic, and overall the joke of its genre, GLADIATOR is grossly overrated. I desperately wanted to like this film, but it fell way below my expectations of what a historical drama should be.",Null,0,0,17 July 2000
