The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," weakest film of the franchise but a good movie.
","I have to start by saying this one is the worst movie of the franchise. It is a good movie and Jennifer Lawrence gives another strong performance but they should have made only one last movie instead of two. That's the major problem with this movie, they tried to stretch the last book in two movies and it feels like that on the movie. The movie lacks the energy and life of the other two movies. All the situation with the resistance is good, it has son good drama, some good scenes and some emotion but it feels like a preview for the next one. The movie stays true to the book in almost every aspect and does a really good job on bringing the book to life but it fell short of my expectations. The good think about this movie is that they left most of the best scenes, action and drama for the next one.",9,3,20,18 December 2014
Interstellar," the best movie of the year
","I went into this movie with huge expectations, I was expecting a really god movie and it delivered. Interstellar is the best movie of the year. The visuals on this movie are great, the science behind everything is mostly accurate and it was really a very smart movie. For such a long movie you feel like time is flying, it is so good and so entertaining that it doesn't feel like a long movie. The story is developed in a smart and refreshing way, it is interesting, smart and full of life and substance. The movie is so perfectly crafted that you feel like you are part of the movie. You get involved in the characters situations, you get immersed into the movie. I don't think there is a movie this year that can bring such a great experience like the one interstellar brings.",10,0,3,17 December 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," the best of the hobbit trilogy
","A great way to put an end on a great trilogy. It was the best piece of the hobbit trilogy and one of the best movies of the year. This movie is going to be a great hit in the box office, it has all the tools needed to reach the 1 billion club. Other than interstellar, there is no movie with better visuals and special effects this year, it also packs a lot of action, great battle scenes and great character development. The only miss may be on the length of the battle, it took a little too long but it was expected. They did a really good job in developing the relations between the characters and bringing a high level of emotion. I loved the way they developed every character and not only Bilbo. The conflicts between the desire for obtaining the gold and the value of friendship was a bright spot on this movie. Like I said before, a perfect ending for s great trilogy.",8,10,18,18 December 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Great movie, it doesn't deserve any of the hate.
","I am more of a marvel fan but I also enjoy what DC has to offer. I went into this movie with some reservations because of all the hate it received from the critics. To my surprise, I ended loving this movie and it was very intense and beautiful on the eyes. I am not a fan of DC extended universe superman but the rest of the characters did a really good job. Batman and Wonder Woman where really cool in this movie, especially Wonder Woman. The villains are a little flat but the same can be said about the villains in the MCU. In my opinion it was an improvement on man of steel and its a good start on the right path. It has some flaws but the good things outweigh any flaws in the movie. I have to say that this movie provided a really good, fun superhero experience.",10,11,21,24 March 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Masterpiece, a mix of great things.
","When I first heard that there was going to be another Mad Max movie I felt like it wasn't necessary, I really liked the previous ones but I thought that something similar to the new Robocop was going to happen. Then the trailers came down and they looked really good. But I never imagined just how great this movie was going to be. I left the cinema with my mind blown, it was such a masterpiece. The visuals of the move where great, they looked like real art, the music, characters, the world, everything was perfectly crafted. It's such a mix of action, visuals, music, tone, characters that feels like perfection. One of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. That's what an action film should be.",10,3,9,20 May 2015
