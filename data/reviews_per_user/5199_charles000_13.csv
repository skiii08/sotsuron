Sucker Punch," Maybe not for everyone . . . but for what it is, can be uniquely entertaining
","You'll either get this, or you won't; it's definitely not for everyone.
However, if you just go into this with an open mind, and no specific expectations, you might find the experience entertaining, maybe get the metaphorical messages woven within, but at the very least have an appreciation for the profound visual artpiece that this production is.
On the surface, of course, one could simply pass this off as a ridiculously silly story populated with absurdly one dimensional, cliche characters. But then again, there's much to be symbolically extracted from this story if one wants to look at the layers within. Even under the worst of circumstances, and the characters here are most certainly mired in a very dark situation, a dream can still flourish from which empowerment can be possible.
Such is the nature of Baby Doll's potential demise, having been brought into this terrible situation as the outcome of her abusing scumbag father's scheme to rob her of her inheritance by having her committed to an insane asylum, where her fate is to become lobotomized. However . . .
The story, such as it is, is not meant to be taken literally, but rather appreciated for the metaphorical messages within, wrapped up into a series of visually spectacular fantasy vignettes.
As suggested earlier, this production is not for everyone, but I'm guessing most viewers will still come away from this having experienced something uniquely entertaining.
The production quality is first rate, and even though the characters here are meant to overly exaggerated cliches, the acting was well done. Given the ambitious nature of what was being attempted, this could have turned out much worse, it was definitely a risky gamble to try to pull this off and have it work as intendedI can go with eight stars here and not feel that's overstating it's value as a well done, graphic novel fantasy artpiece.",8,4,6,31 January 2019
Child 44," Excellent film, cerebral and complex, maybe not for everyone . . .
","This is an excellent, but complex film. No, it's not an 'action thriller', no wild chase scenes or moment to moment cgi enhanced adrenaline shots. If that's what you are looking for, no need to spend time here, you won't get this film at all.However . . . As an exceptionally well acted, well crafted examination of the human condition, brought to its various extremes under extraordinarily challenging circumstances, this is an example of applied filmcraft well worth its time.Noomi Rapace and Tom Hardy could not have possibly delivered their characters any better. If anything, they propelled this production beyond what it's initial limitations might have been. That's not to detract from the other actors in this production, all of whom were well cast and credibly delivered their ensemble of characters.Though the primary plot line of this story centers around a serial child killer and his eventual fate, this evolving thread is woven into the fabric of a multi-layered, complex examination of life in post WWII Stalinist Russia, the Soviet Union in its darkest days. There is a reason why this film was banned in current day Russia.Yes, it is true that many contemporary Russians have difficulty understanding or believing the contextual background as depicted in this production, but as one who has personally known various Russians over the years who were there at that time, or who had relatives who lived through this era, the general depictions are chillingly close to the actual experiences familiar to many from that time. Much more time could be spent here trying to explain this in detail for those who are not familiar, but elaborating on such descriptions may be beyond the context of this film review. As for the production quality of this film, the attention to detail and cinema photography is remarkably well done. To watch this film really does transport the viewer into an experience of that era. I freely admit this film may not be for everyone, but for those who can resonate with this elaborate study of the human condition, as extruded through the mandrel of this cultural and historical motif, it is a remarkable production well worth its time.",9,5,8,16 August 2015
Interstellar," Probably the easiest 10 I've ever voted for a film . . .
","Probably the easiest 10 I've ever voted for a film, and that's saying a lot since I very rarely score any film of any genre with a 10 or even a 9.This production is so radically different, even if you don't happen to be a sci-fi fan or one who ponders the greater questions of existence on this world and in the universe, this production will open up this realm of thought via a journey that is spectacular.The closest conceivable comparison that might be possible would be Stanley Kubrick's 2001:A Space Odyssey, but that's only a very rough analogy at best.Every aspect of this production was crafted about as perfectly as could be given the context of the story, and what it's trying to convey. Are there technical or scientific flaws as such as portrayed? Yes, of course, much of this is wrapped around theoretical concepts which are still very much a work in progress.But that such a complex and compelling concept could be woven into a story with such heart, mapped into the very essence of what it is to be human . . . this is a film very much worth the time spent to watch it.My suggestion would be that you may likely watch it several times, as various layers and dimensions become evermore present in ways that may not have been initially apparent the first time going in.A special thumbs up to Anne Hathaway, this may have been her best role ever (in my admittedly biased opinion), but everyone in this film shines.The direction, cinema photography, production quality . . . absolutely top notch, don't think this could have been done much better.As I said earlier, even if this is not your typical cup of tea, take a sip with this one. I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed.My score 10+",10,1,2,7 June 2018
Oblivion," Surprisingly well done
","Surprisingly well done. Not an entirely original concept, but the story had enough unique features to still make it compelling and interesting.I freely admit to being a bit skeptical going in with Tom Cruise as the lead role, but that was tempered by knowing that Olga Kurylenko would be there. OK, I could watch her in just about anything (and have seen almost every film she's ever been in), and was not disappointed. This is a film where you will want to pay attention to details. Understanding who (and what) Tom Cruise's character is will become apparent as the film progresses, so am not going to recite the details of that plot thread here, but it does require a willingness to follow those details as they emerge. As for Olga, this may be her best performance yet. She has progressed remarkably since her early days in films like 'the Assassin Next Door'.That's not to take anything away from Andrea Riseborough, who played the complex role of a highly intelligent woman, but one who is conflicted and confined by specific belief boundaries that had been programmed into her. Morgan Freeman, of course, fits his part exactly, as will become apparent later in the film.No spoilers here, but I might offer that in the genre' of post apocalyptic, earth is in dire peril and who we are destined to be as a type of species plot formats, this one is a bit different. There is considerably more to this production than just eye candy, though the CGI is quite well done. Unlike some films of a quasi similar genre', the CGI is beautifully done where relevant, but does not overpower the details of the plot threads as they emerge. This is one of those rare examples where the balance between technically stunning visual content and pace of story actually fit remarkably well together. Kudos to Joseph Kosinski for maintaining that balance in this well crafted production.A very solid 9 stars for this one.",9,6,7,24 September 2017
The Italian Job," Unwatchable . . .
","Unwatchable . . . which is truly unfortunate, since Charlize Theron was always someone I could watch, no matter what the production was, until this turkey.Sorry folks, but this is such a disappointing flop. I did try to stick with it, hoping it would somehow improve further into the story, but no, it just became an unintended parody of itself.The intention seems to be an attempt at a more whimsical remake of the original film, but instead, it just came off ridiculously misguided and pointless. The clichéd caricatures of the various parts were just annoyingly simplistic, an insult to the cast of actors, all of whom are quite credible and talented. There was no depth of character development, nothing . . . just flat, cardboard representations of excruciatingly obvious non-entity clichés.I hope the actors at least were paid well for their time spent with this loser project.As for anyone actually watching this turkey, spare yourself the misery, and don't become a loser of your valuable time.",1,5,9,20 October 2016
Pitch Black," This is a great film! If this is your genre', you won't be disappointed . . .
","I will admit, I was already a fan of Serenity, Riddick Chronicles and all that, so I did go into this film with a bit of predetermined anticipation. On the flip side, I'm not always that much of a Vin Deisel fan, in that he is somewhat mono-dimensional in his range of characters, but for the embodiment of Riddick, he does fit perfectly. As for the story and how it plays out, the pace is good, not too encumbered with gratuitous special effects and all that, but where it does fit, the CGI is well done and appropriate.The one really glaring technical defect in this story is how everyone just gets out and starts walking around, breathing in the air without the slightest concern for differences in the atmosphere, microbes and so on, but this is a common flaw that is often somehow glossed over in many such stories, so I can't harp on that detail too much.As for Radha Mitchell, she is smokin' hot here, not in a ridiculous or frivolous way, but as her tough, seasoned interplanetary merchant marine ship's captain character 'Fry', she nails it perfectly. If anything, she very much reminds me of Andrea Osvart (see her as the Hungarian assassin 'Gilda' in the film 'Two Tigers').Now, if these two ladies ever appeared together in a film, I would drop everything and go check that out in a heartbeat . . . but I digress.In any case, I have no trouble with granting 8 stars to 'Pitch Black'.",Null,40,47,28 September 2011
Knowing," I love this film! It is daring, challenging the viewer to think way outside the box
","I love this film! It is daring, well acted, but most importantly, challenges the viewer to think . . . way outside the box.On a scale of 1 - 10, I'll give this film a 12+, and I am not usually inclined to be so generous in my comments along these lines.I have always had considerable respect for Nicholas Cage as an actor, but in this film, he shines - could not have been castled more perfectly.I freely admit, this film is not for everyone. If you're someone who stays glued to the TV screen watching the usual sort of mindless dribble that is dished out to the mainstream TV audience, this film is probably not for you.The one clue I will offer is that this is sort of what 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' could have been, although I did like that film as well, and Keanu Reeves was the perfect choice for the part in that film, in its modern remake version.But 'Knowing' truly is unique.People who are scared of thinking outside the box, and like to stay safely ensconced in the world they were trained to believe in, in many cases will not 'get this' - that's to be expected.But for a very large and growing percentage of the population who are beginning to take a serious look at what our history on this planet might have been, and what many are now trying to understand in this context, this film does walk the viewer down a path that leads to areas of thought that are quite timely.This was a well crafted example of the art-form - two thumbs up!",10,19,38,25 March 2009
Million Dollar Baby," An absolutely excellent example of filmcraft . . . engaging on so many levels
","This film really surprised me, in that I am not a 'boxing movie' type at all, not even remotely, and in general not particularly interested in the sports / boxing saga type of genre'.But in this piece, the character development, the way that the various threads of lives and story are woven together into a compelling tapestry is well crafted, and performed.The entire piece completely transcends the usual sort of cliché' components that are so typical in other such films of the genre'.Of course, I must confess that I could watch Hillary Swank in almost anything, but here she really delivers a performance that may be her best yet . . . and I've seen almost all of her work.Clint Eastwood really has matured as a talented director, which was the other major surprising aspect of this film.The pieces of the puzzle fit together perfectly as the story becomes evermore detailed, the background of her family history and the strange (but highly believable) collection of characters in that family, and of course, Clint's character as the father searching for an answer, a resolution to a seemingly impossible personal quest.There are no weak links or dull moments in any of this, but the ending is . . . difficult to accept, not because of a lack of credibility, but rather for the exact opposite reason, in that the hard edge of life's challenges do indeed become manifest in their own unexpected ways.No clues beyond that will be offered here, though I will offer one parting thought for consideration.This is one of those films that I can (and have) watch time and again, and still discover an engaging experience every time.Rarely do I suggest a rating of 10, for any genre' of film, but in this case, I do so without the slightest hesitation.",10,3,5,30 June 2011
In Time," I was skeptical at first, but I must admit, it is a fun film to watch . . . and yes, the concept of time as a commodity has been the quest of many
","Of course, everyone will no doubt think of this as a remake of Logan's run . . . but wait, hold that thought.As a sort of side note, I personally have actually had some interaction with what might be referred to as applied nanobiology in the context of treating the pathology of aging, as an attainable medical regimen.These concepts are no longer strictly confined to the realms of science fiction, as I can attest to such from direct personal experience. In today's world, are we anywhere even remotely within reach of the world depicted in 'In Time'?. No, hardly, but that does not suggest these exact questions have in fact been discussed quite seriously, in various academic and scientific circles.So it was with this particular background that I wanted to see this film, to get a gander on what Hollywood would do with such a concept, extruded through the lens of early 21st century technopop culture.Some aspects of the film were just plain silly, but that can be overlooked to a certain degree. Justin Timberlake does deliver his character well enough, but for me at least, Amanda Seyfried was the real sparkle in this production. Was it entertaining? Yes indeed, I'll probably see it again with various comrades. Does it beckon some interesting questions? Yes it does, and that may be what makes this particular production so timely (please forgive the terrible pun). The questions that have been raised in previous eras, encompassing the entire overarching arena of ethics in a biotech enhanced, genetically contrived reality preserved for the privileged few, the agony of overpopulation vs quality of life, 'genetic capitalism' and so on, have been discussed many times, by very serious people.But now, it is within some potential future timeline that the tools for crafting such a genotopia for privileged elite is actually being considered not as fiction, but rather as the next level of priceless possession, an outcome of artificially induced evolution as an acceptable 'norm' in the eyes of some. I should know, having personally seen bits and pieces of this puzzle already being assembled.If nothing else, if this entertainment platform inspires further thought into this realm, perhaps that is the real value of this film.Even if all the potential viewer is looking for is an entertaining bit of fantasy filmcraft, I don't think many will be disappointed. As I said, I was initially more than a bit skeptical at first, this could have been much worse . . . but I will confess (perhaps it's a bit of a guilty pleasure), it was quite fun to watch.",9,2,4,26 November 2011
Downfall," You are not likely to be disappointed . . . the best film ever done of this genre'
","I know this history well, have studied it for decades. As such, I don't know if it would be possible to execute a more perfect rendering of this moment in time, and the consequences thereof within the final days of Hitler's demise.The portrayal of all the characters, their personalities and actions at the time could not have been more perfectly matched. Having seen the Bunker, and various other films of this genre', I was initially somewhat less than enthusiastic about seeing yet another 'last days in the bunker' sort of film, but having read various reviews (not just here, but from a variety of sources), my thought was OK, I can take a brief glance at it. However, from the very first few minutes onward, it became immediately apparent that the caliber of acting and direction of this work was far beyond anything I was expecting. Even if you may not be that particularly interested or aware of this history, I would still strongly recommend giving 'Downfall' a chance, just to experience an excellent example of acting and filmcraft that is rarely presented to current audiences. I was going to try to be at least a bit contrary to the other reviewers, but in all honesty, I can see why the 10 star rating is so consistent, as such is my rating as well. You are not likely to be disappointed.",Null,1,2,19 November 2011
Black Panther," Embarrassing disappointment . . .
","How sad . . . I was truly looking forward to a uniquely crafted film experience, but no matter how much I wanted to have that experience, it just wasn't there.Much effort was devoted to the sets, aesthetic motifs, and beautifully outfitted actors. As a plotless visual artpiece, it had its moments. Beyond that, it was an embarrassingly silly attempt at a story, filled with mono-dimensional cliched characters.I can appreciate the cultural concept that was being attempted. In that context, this could have been a spectacular opportunity for the Marvel franchise, but it was sadly missed.To say this production was a disappointment would be more than an understatement. That it actually ended up on Netflix so soon after its run in the theaters is an appropriate assessment of this unfortunate missed opportunity for something that could have been so much more.For visual aesthetic, it deserves 2 stars . . . but beyond that, not much can be said for this unfortunate production.",2,4,6,7 September 2018
Mother!," Lots of clichéd vignettes, thrown together as a sort of self evolving puzzle . . .
","Yes . . . one could consume endless paragraphs of pretentious art fluff verbiage, hoping to sound importantly relevant, spewing out a meandering pseudo-intellectual diatribe on the significance of this object d' art.But why?Sorry, at the risk of sounding like a servile dolt to some who wish to occupy their own delusional sense of self important grandeur, this was an attempt (a very clumsily failed attempt) to blurt out a rendering of the foibles of the human condition, extruded through the mandrel of this 'visionary' production.These themes have been rehashed endlessly before, and in most previous cases, at least there was an attempt at delivering some sort of coherence throughout the production.Not here.Lots of clichéd vignettes, thrown together as a sort of self evolving puzzle with the theoretical mission of delivering a profound message from which we can extract experiential wisdom. Am I awestruck by this 'profound' production?No . . . fail, ridiculously so.The 'ending', which I will not reveal here of course, is tacked onto the last 30 seconds or so of the film, as a convenient out as if to summarize what's going on during the previous 2 hours, leading up to 'the big reveal'.Trust me on this one . . . it's not worth the wait.My condolences to Jennifer Lawrence for having participated in this ill-fated, over the top disaster of a purported art film.No doubt she was paid well for her performance here, but seriously, this is not something she is likely to want to be remembered for.OK, technically, the production quality is good, kudos for some nice set construction and camera work.But, as others have suggested, I also want my 2 hours back.If negative stars could be awarded, this would be a -10, or less.However, in keeping with IMDB protocol, a single star will have to do.",1,8,11,7 January 2018
Cloud Atlas," One of the most spectacular examples of filmcraft I have experienced in quite some time . . .
","Cloud Atlas really is one of the most spectacular examples of filmcraft I have experienced in quite some time . . . and for me, that's saying a lot and then some.I wouldn't even attempt to briefly describe for those who have yet to see this. This piece not for everyone, although it is very entertaining . . . this really is a 'thinking person's film'.A fantastically risky concept to attempt packing into a film, and yet, have it not only actually work, but be executed so brilliantly.This one stands out, so uniquely.There were no weak spots anywhere in this production. Halle Berri, Tom Hanks, and everyone else delivered some of the best roles / multiple characters of their careers. For those folks just looking for typical flashy comic book sci-fi fluff films, don't even bother . . . there will be no comprehension of what is being presented.But for those who can and will connect the dots in this fantastically crafted production, this really will leave a permanent imprint on one's psyche.",10,5,9,16 December 2012
