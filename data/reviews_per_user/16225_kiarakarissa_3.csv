Despicable Me 2," One hilarious-of-a-kind
","Minions alone can make the audience laugh. Adding to that is Gru & the 3 little kids action. This is one hilarious movie ever. Though it has lower ratings than the 1st one, I must say that this is better. And the fact that most audience was adults, it means that the movie gets the heart of both children & child-in-mind movie-goers. Though something was missing... and I can't even figure out what is it. Maybe it is the lack of villains. I mean, compared to the 1st one, the villain took most of the part of the movie. But on this one, only a little about it. But the way the minions delivers their actions, I can totally say that this is a good movie. The after credits makes me think that there's gonna be a 3rd movie. And boy I can't wait for that.",10,1,1,23 July 2013
Argo," **SPOILER ALERT: This review may contain scenes from the movie**
","I'd give thumbs up for Ben Affleck for directing this film. But I'm not sure about giving him a thumbs up for acting on this one. The movie is great with all awesomeness in me while watching this. Surely, I can't predict what may happen next. Though I know the ending might be as well as good, it's hard to think of the next scene while I am so much focused on the story. As for the other actors, I find their role too simple. The story line is what amazes me. It's really hard to imagine that it happened in reality. Especially when they were escaping from Iran and the soldiers were too close to capture them already. Though some I don't believe that some of those scenes did really happened. The one when Ben Affleck tried too check their ticket confirmation for the 2nd time and they got it already. So much coincidence for that too happen. Or they could do well to convince people that it really happened.",10,0,3,31 May 2013
Tangled," Rapunzel
","A Rapunzel's story. Cute and amazing film. My friend told me that he liked the film. But he hates the singing scenario on the movie. But for me, it was alright. I've seen such movies like this. Like Cinderella and Shrek, they all got a comedy, romance, musical, action, all in one movie. And this is just one of them. Kids will surely love this. At first I feel bored about this movie. So it took me about a week to finally finish this. But after seeing the movie trailer again, I realized that it still has some comedy parts. And I love that part. The middle part of this movie was great. With Rapunzel's powers, she can heal people who is wounded.",8,4,7,19 January 2011
