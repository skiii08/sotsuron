First Man," First man is a good look into the MAN Neil Armstrong
","Though I've been a fan of Neil Armstrong since I watched him walk on the moon as a kid. So, I was super excited this film was coming out.Then, I heard that the director had dissed America in the movie not showing the American flag on the moon and defending that decision with some wishy-washy thing about Armstrong thinking they were ambassadors of all nations etc. So, I thought about not going to see it. But, then I thought, 'Hey; it's a movie about NEIL ARMSTRONG. I can't miss that.' So, I went and was glad I did.SPOILER ALERT:
Firstly, let's get the flag thing out of the way up front. They showed plenty American flags in the show - from the flag shoulder patches on their space suit to one of Armstrong's boys raising an American flag at school and finally a wide angle REAL footage shot of a (later than Apollo 11) Lunar Module on the surface of the moon with the American flag planted in the lunar soil. So, as an American, I was ok with that part of the movie.But what really makes this movie is the look at all the things weighing on Armstrong the human being, husband, father and astronaut during his decision to become an astronaut and eventually to land on the moon. It explored the tragic death of their infant daughter Karen and how he kept that locked inside, his very low-key personality and engineer's mind analyzing and - most importantly, the strain of all this on his family life.The only criticisms of this movie I noticed were minor ones; the film is no 'Apollo 13' - seemingly a little less brightly lit and dynamic than that film, and I could've done without so much shaking the camera - especially during the launch sequences. That got wearisom on the eyes.But, again; those are minor points. This is a pretty good movie, I'd say.",8,16,37,12 October 2018
The Monuments Men," At first I hated it, but then....
","I'm going to say there may be spoilers in this - just to be safe!When this movie first came out I was very eager to see it. Before I did, I learned that none of the characters were real, etc so I decided not to see it.I DID however at this same time read the book about the REAL Monuments Men. After which I got around to renting the movie - and I hated it.Then after awhile I reread the book. Then over the past year I caught the movie several times on cable.Then I reread the book one more time - and it finally dawned on me! The enormity of the task the personnel of the Monuments, Fine Art and Archives (MFAA) program faced figuring out where the stolen art caches were hidden, getting to them before the Nazis destroyed them first, if successful then cataloging the pieces in each of the caches, preserving them for transport, determining rightful owners (if possible) and returning them (if possible).So, how on earth could such a huge undertaking with a staff of 300_ persons be told in a 2-hour movie without some composite characters and only showing highlight events of the whole thing?Like I say, the more I learned about the whole project, the more I ended up liking this film.",7,1,2,13 January 2016
The Lost City of Z," Yawn....
","I'm going to claim I'm including a Spoiler Alert! just in case I accidentally do say something that could give a spoiler.Honestly, 'Lost City' is not a really bad movie...but not a really good one either. At times it was interesting enough, but other times seemed to drag and was a bit disjointed. Case in point; the suddenly estranged relationship between father and son and then all of a sudden near the end, the relationship was miraculously repaired and to the point where son was advocating he and Dad go out together and discover the 'fantasy' his father had been chasing most of the kid's life. So, like I say; it wasn't absolutely terrible, but probably not a movie I'd sit thru again - even if it didn't cost me money or effort to see it.",5,5,11,23 April 2017
Bridge of Spies," Smashing good show!
","This one's a keeper! I will say I have spoilers in here just to be safe, but will try not to include any.First off, the acting is VERY good. The guy who plays the Russian spy is so dead pan all the time, he just cracked me up. ('Would it help?') And of course, Tom Hanks puts on his usual great performance.Secondly, the sets and costumes really leave you feeling immersed in the time and place. Well done! I LOVE a movie that can do that!Thirdly, the plot is really great! A real spell-binder and seemed to - for all the research I can find - follow the true events pretty faithfully. Which really makes me tip my hat to the guy Hanks plays for having such guts to press the limit. To avoid it being a spoiler, that's all I'll say about that.This is just a very well-done movie. My only criticism would be the hokeyness (SPOILER ALERT PROBABLY FOLLOWS) the U2 pilot being tied to his disintegrating aircraft by his O2 hose. PLEASE! Other than that, this one's a keeper and a candidate for a DVD buy.",9,0,2,4 January 2016
Dunkirk," Myeh....
","Went to see DUNKIRK a few days ago. It's taken me that long to put my reaction to it into words. Fair warning; probably this whole review has some level of spoiler in the wording so consider this your spoiler alert.Firstly, let me point out that I eagerly awaited this movie. Unfortunately, my thoughts at the end were, 'Well, it's a typical British movie.' In that, several subplots just started in the middle and ended in the middle. Case in point, no explanation given to how the school chum of the boat owner's kid got into the act of being at the dock to jump on board or why.For that matter, there really wasn't much character development from start to finish which left the whole movie seeming to be pretty shallow and meaningless.And, the whole Air:1 hour, Sea:1 day, Land:1 week thing just fell flat. There was no explanation of that whole flow at the beginning or throughout so the audience was just left to figure it out – or not. And, there really wasn't much credible attempt to tie them all together by the end of the movie. there were several occasions where the same event was suddenly and seemingly out of sequence relived from a different character's perspective. This left the audience thinking 'Wait! I'm confused. Didn't that guy already die/that ship already sink/that airplane already go down?' So the audience had to figure out the 'reliving' thing all on their own which risked the audience not connecting the events correctly.That whole 'last Spitfire' thing was an abomination to the point of being insulting to anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge of aircraft, aerodynamics, physics, etc. Firstly, I thought the damned thing was gonna glide so long after running out of fuel that the pilot was going to need an 'expect further clearance' time. And to think that an aircraft that's ran out of gas could be capable of superior aerial combat over an enemy aircraft is just downright absurd. The burning Spitfire thing at the end - to prevent it from falling into enemy hands - was fine and factual except that the obvious lack of an engine in the fire and instead a big broomstick was holding up the propeller was a joke.Overall, this whole flick just seemed incredibly shallow. Like an attempt to be artsy that just fell flat.About the only benefit to me seeing this movie was the new perspective to the Dunkirk evacuation that the troops evacuated may have left the beach more than once (as different ships were sunk out from under them) before finally reaching England.",3,8,14,30 July 2017
The Longest Day," Still a great film!
","This movie does a great job of bringing such a massive logistical operation down to the individual level in several of the major components - paratroopers, infantry storming ashore, naval personnel on the ships, the generals trying to plan it all, etc etc.Some have criticized it for not being explicit enough in the violence and others who say that it tried to do too much at once. I'd like to point out that this movie was released in 1962. That was only 18 years after the actual invasion. Hence, the audience knew the horrors of war - they'd lived thru it. If they didn't actually serve in combat, they sure knew men who did, maybe even knew one or two who died in combat. Hence, they didn't need to be shown all the gore that was shown in 'Saving Private Ryan' cause they knew it far too well.As far as the scope of the movie, one must realize the depth of the operation the movie tried to overview. To do that, the movie had to be long. To give each component of that massive scope a human element, yet provide insight into what it was like for the individuals involved, the movie had to be long and it had to involve numerous subplots to even come close to being representative.And, here we are 73 years on from the actual event the movie portrays and this great flick STILL draws a great following. I'd say all of that makes it a 10/10.",10,3,5,21 February 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Myeh.....
","I want to like this latest SW episode. I really do. However.... First the positives:It was good to see Han, Chewie, Leia, C3PO, R2 and Luke again. And it's great to see the Millennium Falcon fly again.The new main character droid, the 'beachball' BB-8 was pretty cool. And Chewie is even more of a card than in his previous roles.Now the negatives: So much of this movie seemed to be a remake with new characters and actors of Episode IV - droid has secret info that has to be delivered to rebels; some version of a death star has to be destroyed to save the galaxy from the bad guys, the main bad guy wears a mask that electronically distorts his voice, the nightclub has a funky alien Catina band, blah blah blah.Like I said; I could almost imagine this to be a cheap warming over of Episode IV. I'm glad I paid a matinÃ©e price and not an evening show ticket price.And certain parts of the plot just seemed to happen mysteriously without a lot of development/explanation. And no matter if it's their first time to even handle a new weapon or to deal with the Force, the heroes seem to be expert at using them with no training. Really? At least in Ep. IV Obi-Wan had to train Luke on the force and how to use a light saber.SPOILER ALERT! Could they have been more obvious they were leaving this open to a sequel?Killing Han Solo? Really? Seriously? Oh, man!",4,30,38,5 January 2016
