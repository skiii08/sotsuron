The Rock," A true classic that brings out the best in everyone.
","This movie was great. Not only did it have a great cast but a great plot. This movie has it all. A great car chase, 4 great shoot outs, a really good fist fight and more. If you are looking for a car chase movie see Gone in 60 Seconds, if you are looking for a movie with villains killing everyone see Con Air, if you are looking for great gun show downs and many one on one fights see Face/Off. If you are looking for just one film with all that watch The Rock. Also do not forget this movie came out before all of those 3 great action movies. 90/100",10,3,3,1 October 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," This film is the best.
","I think that this film is the best film of the year. It is hard to not to see the similar characteristics from Star Wars. Sean Bean(the best character)was amazing. Viggo Morteson was really good, Sean Austin was a good companion, Elijah Wood was also good. Star Wars people such as Han Solo can be compared to Morteson, Wood to Skywalker, Blanchett to yoda, Ian Mckellen to Obi Wan, Lee to Vader, and the hobbitts to R2D2 and C3PO. Sean Bean, John Rys Davies and the bow and arrow guy were really good heroes(even Sean Bean), that is why the film is so powerful. Hugo Weaving was pretty good with a small role, though he, Sean Bean, Ian Holm(will be back for the third one), and Gollum will not be back.",10,0,1,22 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," A film by Michael Bay
","Bad Boys:whatcha gonna do? A Michael Bay film. The Rock:Get ready to rock! A Michael Bay film. Armageddon:Heads up! A Michael Bay film. Pearl Harbor: December 7, 1941-It was a Sunday morning... A Michael Bay film. Michael Bay has been known for these 4 films. Of all these, Pearl Harbor will be remembered. A day that no one will ever forget is brought back. Pearl Harbor is a film that needs no words. The romance story to me was not really a romance, it was more of a comedy at first. Maybe of the first hour and twenty minutes there was 30 minutes of romance. The action sequences before and after December 7th were great. December 7th is Bruckheimers second finest work of action ever. The movie was not too long and not too short. Keep it coming you two. I want to see whatcha gonna do again. 8.9/100",10,6,12,8 December 2001
The Transporter," Its an ok film with some impossible moves
","I found this film to be an entertaining one at most but felt that it fell short of being a great chase movie with some cool fight scenes. I think Jason Straham is a good actor but should do more films like Italian Job and Snatch, not movies like the Transporter. **/****.",6,0,0,23 August 2003
From Dusk Till Dawn," I bet you did not expect the film to change from hostage situation to vampires.
","Great Great Great Great. Thats what I can say for this film because it really shocked me when I was saw this. Back when I was 9 I saw this and I loved it so much. It was graphic because I could remember Starz not playing it until 10:00 pm because of its violence and language. Now i can officially tell you, that Starz was right not to play the movie until 10:00. I though enjoyed the hell out of this one and will never forget it. The film went from hostage situation to vampire vs human in a matter of 15 minutes. I was expecting the movie to end like in a police chase or something, not vampires killing everyone in sight. I loved this film and its out of nowhere second half story line. For sure a cult classic. *****/*****",10,1,2,13 September 2003
Con Air," It Was
","It was great. Never have I seen such a movie. Bruckheimer brings his opinion of cons stealing a plain to life. To all the people who said it was bad well watch it again and see the magic from it all. It blows up in your face. Cusack and Malkovich are 2 Johns looking for a great movie. They got it. Cage was so convincing with the accent. All he wanted to do was see his family. He was really good. Ving Rhames played Nathon Jones(known as one tough mother f****r.) He was superb. Others like Danny Trego, Colm Meany, M.C Gainey, Rachel Ticotin, Steve Eastin, David Chapelle, Monica Potter, Nick Chinlund, Renoly, Landry Allbright, and Mykelti Williamson were really good. But no other man was as good as Steve Bucsemi. I cut off one girls head and wore it as a hat through 3 states. He is worse than Hanniball Lector. With the protection mask and straight jacket that made em laugh harder than anything in Rat Race or American Pie 2. Almost better than Gone in Sixty Seconds. 9.3/10",10,0,1,25 September 2001
