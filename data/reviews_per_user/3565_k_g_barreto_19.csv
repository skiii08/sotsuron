Requiem for a Dream," Heartbraking
","Before watching, I heard a lot about this movie. I knew the director, Aronofsky, before for some of his work, as Mother! and Black Swan, and the cast has great actors like Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. But I the reason I watched has more to do with Clint Mansell, and the soundtrack of this movie, whom elevated terrificly the movie's quality. Alread jumping to the ending, when the theme starts playing and you see the three protagonists deplorable situations, it's just so heartbreaking and you feel sad for the characters. Although some bad artistic decisions *cough, split screen, cough* and the first 20 minutes of the movie is kinda monotone, the movie is still great and presents human characters, a realistic scenario and some good acting. It's not a classical cult, indispensable movie, but is certainly worthy watching it.",9,0,2,21 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's fun... and that's all
","The first, chronologyly saying, movie of the Skywalker Saga is a fun ride, and that's all. I wasn't expecting so much before watching, and I was not surprised by the movie either, but it's not as bad as I heard it was, but is clearly the weakest of ALL the Star Wars movies, this doesn't makes it necessarily a bad movie, and I think ''average'' is a good term, I think. Well, apart from Jar Jar Binks and a bit other things, like the humor, everything else is fine and there is some great moments, well, one moment: the battle between Qui-Gon Jinn and Kenobi vs Darth Maul, that is really well done and captivating, everything there was done right in my opinion. The ''political'' part of the movie was meh, and in some parts doesn't makes sense at all, the political system of the Republic is flawed and confusing and I don't know how such thing could it last for millenia. The acting, well... Liam Neeson is okay, the same for Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor was a fresh actor, so there is no much for say REALLY. In the end, despite the flaws, The Phantom Menace is a watchable, fun movie, and didn't deserve the hate that received.",5,1,3,26 August 2019
Batman Returns," A Bat, a Cat and a Penguin walk into a bar.
","Batman Returns, sequel of the '89 Batman film, starring Michael Keaton as Batman for the second, and probably last, time, and with Tim Burton directing as well. It was a watchable movie, although inferior to the original one. Keaton's Batman doesn't convince and he doesn't have the spotlight, Danny DeVito's Penguim and Pfeiffer's Catwoman are the best things here, mostly for the acting, both characters are just too 'stylized', for the lack of a better term, and honestly, silly as well, they both scream 'TIM BURTON!!!!!!' in absolutely everything.The rest of the characters are just too boring. Alfred just appears for 5 minutes, and that's okay for the most part, Shreck is the generic 'capitalist pig', evil industrialist, that love his son. It's basically that, and the Selina Kyle vs Shreck whole thing was meh, and nothing more. There's a few other secondary characters that doesn't add practically nothing for the plot. Both Vicky Vale and Harvey Dent are not in the movie, but as a sequel, they should play a major role here. Vicky Vale romance with Bruce was okay in the last movie, I can't say the same for Selina/Catwoman and Bruce/Batman, it seems so forced, and how everything ends is just so disappoiting. No character development for Bruce AND Batman, he's the protagonist and that's it. But the technical part of the film is still good, keeping track with the last one. Elfman soundtrack, Burton's Gotha, all the costumes and the crazyness, penguins in the sewer, a giant duck, the whole aesthetics, it's a Tim Burton film after all.Batman Returns unfortunely is a flawed sequel, after a really good film that sinceraly didn't needed one, but they made it and could be so much better than it was.",6,4,11,17 December 2019
Constantine," Fun and better than expected
","That was an awesome film. Keanu Reeves as John Constantine is perfect, even being somewhat different to the comics, which is not a problem. The supernatural tone is incredible, it's not a horror but the elements are there, it give me the vibes of Hellboy, another film I love. Everyone is good here as well, good acting, good sequences, a cool photography, we have Tilda Swinton as an angel and Constantine holding a holy shotgun. It can't get better.",7,2,4,30 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Ending the trilogy on a high note
","Return of the Jedi, the last film of the original trilogy, gives a satisfying end to the story that was build over the last two movies, and do this in a marvelous way. The film is the most fun to watch in the entire trilogy. I see people criticize this film, mostly because Ewoks, and honestly, I enjoyed them. It's Star Wars, goddamn. There are weird stuff and creatures.The best aspect of the movie, of course, is how the relationship of Luke and Darth Vader is developed, and the presence of the Emperor made it better. The conflict, both of Luke and Vader, is well done. I realy enjoyed the acting of Mark Hamill, that improved a lot in this movie, and how Darth Vader reacts, even with a mask, you know what are his expressions, they really nailed in this part. And the best part of the film, is of course the duel between Luke and Vader, and how Luke lets the angry dominate him, is just phenomenal, is well written, well directed, the acting was on point, it was perfect.Return of the Jedi consolidates the quality and cultural importance of the original trilogy of Star Wars, and honor everything that Star Wars represents.",9,0,1,30 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A watchable movie in the first two acts; A great one in the third act
","The second part of the prequels trilogy of Star Wars looked to me, in the first two acts, as a boring movie, but not THAT boring. The romance between Anakin and Padmé was not well written by George Lucas, who's not helped that much delivering some bad dialogues, as the classic 'I don't like sand', and the acting of Hayden makes it everything worse, but it's not his fault, looks hard to act out from the dialogues he have. The plot of Kenobi tracking down Jango Fett is okay, nothing special, nothing really that interesting, the designs of Kamino and Geonosis are... meh, but the character of Jango Fett is fine and that's all. The real magic happens in the third act. Count Dooku, who Christopher Lee plays perfectly, the return of the Trade Federation, and the plans of the Separatists are revelead then. The Battle of Geonosis is great, and I don't really minded at all the outdated CGI, but what really made it everything even better was the battle of Count Dooku vs Kenobi and Anakin, and later on Dooku vs Yoda. Really liked how the Force was used, the coreography, it was great from the beginning to the end. And the plot twist, if this is the right term, was great, but not that surprising. Attack of the Clones is a good movie, but reafirms the fact that the original trilogy is better, as we are close to the end and the two movies that passed was just okay.",6,0,1,26 August 2019
Watchmen," Great adaptation of Alan Moore's magnum opus
","3 hours and 30 minutes of pure Zack Snyder at his best is the best definition of the Ultimate Cut. I've watch the theatrical cut as well, both have its qualities, but the Ultimate Cut is really something. I've paused sometimes to check the graphic novel and Snyder really captures the tone, the world, the aspect and the messages of the original work. I liked the inclusion of the Tales of the Black Freighter, back on the movie I was thinking about the pacing, not liking it, but after seeing all the movie, the pacing here is good as well. slow-burning, almost hypnotic, I paused sometimes, wish I didn't, seeing this continuously is a experience. Here you can expect fidelity, it looks, walks and talk like the graphic novel, some changes, but I understand why they changed. Expect a great cinematography as well, the gray look of the film fits the narrative, help to create the admosphere of a world without hope, filthy and about to go to war, Zack Snyde directering is great here, he understands the visual medium, he have his own style, unique and kind of megalomaniac. The soundtrack, the edgy gore violence, distinctive action sequences, you know it's a Zack Snyder film. There's so much great things here, a few I didn't like, more subjective things than objective ones. And this film should be released later. After decades of superhero comic books, Alan Moore created THE anti-superhero comic book, which ironically is praised as the best superhero comic book ever made. If this film released with a established MCU, like in 2015 or even now, the impact of this film would be stronger, since it's a very unique comic book movie and different of all films of its kind, even with Logan and Joker out there, but you can use the argument that this film is ahead of its time, because it is.",9,3,6,28 January 2020
Man of Steel," A fresh take on Superman
","Man of Steel, the first movie of the DCEU, is the attempt of Zack Snyder and David Goyer in reimagining Superman into the real world, and they both did a great job. This is the first time someone tried to do something different with Superman in film, we only had the Reeve era as Superman and Superman Returns, a nostalgic take on that same era. Giving to us a conflicted Superman, bringing him to the real world, and forcing him in situations he hadn't been before in previous movies, is a bold move. I tought every narrative choice, even the polemic ones, were great and it had a purpose, built Superman persona, and prepared us to future arcs, as seen in Batman v Superman. The unique and fresh take on Superman is the outstanding part of this film, plus the cinematography, with the incredible fighting sequences, THE flight sequence, it gave the movie this breath of life, something I hadn't seen on MCU. Zod also added to this movie this fresh look, one of the best villains in comic book movies, his motivations, the passion in Michael Shannon perfomance, the dialogue, he have a purpose that drives him, the survival of his species, and you understand his points. Superman here is fantastic, this is a great incarnation of the character, Henry Cavill does a good job, while some say this is version doesn't show the side of Superman that embodies Truth, Justice and the American Way, this is not truth, Superman is driven by his belief in the human race, even if he is conflicted with his kryptonian side. There are a lot of many aspects, the photography, the casting, the production and the costume design, god tier in the Krypton Prologue, the visual effects, the pacing is good enough, among others. The first chapter of the DCEU show to us a new and daring interpretation of the Man of Steel, distinguish itself from the MCU and delivers one of the best super-hero origin story movies ever made.",10,4,5,4 February 2020
Batman Begins," The perfect super-hero origin story film
","The first film of Nolan's Batman trilogy is iconic and memorable, as the other 2 parts as well. But for being the first one, it has its charm. The film capture what's Batman stands for and his essence perfectly. The idea, the symbol of Batman, something that the trilogy focus on, it's not shallow and really well done. Christian Bale is very good as Bruce Wayne, unfortunely his Batman voice was a letdown for me, but I easily forget it, it's not that big of a problem. Finally, Gordon has the treatment he deserves, and being played by Gary Oldman makes it better. I love the graphic novel Year One by Frank Miller, where Jim Gordon is the protagonist in a way, and they definetely took inspiration from there, which is great. Scarecrow and Ra's Al Ghul were fine, Liam Neeson perfomance convinced me, too bad he appeared shortly. Caines's Alfred and Lucius Fox were great too. I enjoyed this film very much, seeing one of you favorite directors making a film about one of your favorite characters isn't usual.",7,0,0,7 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I enjoyed the film, keep scrolling to see other negative reviews.
","The Last Jedi, the most crontroversial movie of the Star Wars saga, I think, and I think a lot of people agree with me on this. Well, back in 2017, I remembered that people already started to look at the film negatively because of the 'Jedi must end' line that appears on the early trailer of the movie. Before its release, the film was getting positive reviews. The critics liked the movie, so nothing to worry about. The buzz started when the leaks, with all spoilers, popped up in reddit. 'Everyone' was mad about the portrait of Luke in this film. Why he would even think in kill his nephew? And the idea of Luke dying received a surprising amount of hate. Then the film release, received blacklash from the fans, I remember a youtube channel doing 50 or more videos per day talking about how bad The Last Jedi is, and that's happens till this day, a lot of channels still talk abou that movie. For the best or for the worst, the film is still discussed 2 years after its release. A director's dream, or nightmare in this case, I think.I watched in the opening weekend, and at first I didn't enjoyed that much, but I didn't hate either. It was a good movie, but I was expecting more from the second part of a trilogy. First, Rey's parents are nobody? All that hype that was built in TFA, and now... PUFF. They're nobody, folks. And what about Snoke? What about his origins, his motivations, how did the First Order started? How did Snoke 'seduced' Ben Solo to the dark side. I was expecting answers, and I got none. The idea of Luke dying didn't bothered me at first, and don't bothers me now. 2 years after its release, and I'm now seeing more positively. Rian Johnson's directing is amazing, people who say otherwise just watched this movie and are haters of this new trilogy. People can dislike his decisions, but his directing was on point. I enjoyed hsi writing as well. Making Luke, that opmistic boy always looking at the horizon expecting a more exciting life back in A New Hope in a flawed bittered old man who regreted his previous decision of training a new generation of Jedis is a new and interesting take, but other writers would prefer to appel to the saga's nostalgia and give to Luke zero depth and development, and the nostalgic fans would love and clap, maybe I would like that take too, but I'm glad I got it something different and I thank Rian Johnson for that. Luke and Kylo Ren are definitely the most developed characters in this movie, and both are amazing in this movie, I enjoyed the character of Kylo Ren a lot more, I understand his motivations, I liked his background, and everything else about it, and Adam Drive acting was on point. I still don't simpatize with Rey, and I'm expecting to finally like her character in Episode IX, fingers crossed, I believe in you JJ. Finn's arch ended on this movie, and he could easily die on this one, with the sacrifice, it would be a worthy ending to the character, but I'm okay with him living, but there's nothing they can do more about his character in Episode IX, his arch was already finalized. Poe became more interesting in this one, he appears briefly in TFA, and here we see more of him, but not that much, I wanted to see more of him. General Holdo was fine, didn't understand why she decided to not share her plan. Her conflict with Poe was well done, but her decision of hide the plan was kinda dumb. Leia's ok, liked her here more than in TFA, where she just made a cameo. Snoke was a poor character, thank you Rian Johnson, my expectations about him was subverted, happy? Gosh, I understand some of the hate about RJ, I mean, what is his thing with 'subverting expectations'? Jesus.Well, talking about the other aspects of the movie, I really loved the photography, the Battle of Crait was absolutely beautiful and astonishing. The soundtrack didn't bringed up anything new, John Williams is in his comfort zone, and it's okay to not take risks, but the lack of personality in this soundtrack was awful, but John Williams is still John Williams and I'll never say something bad about his work (I already did). Visual effects are good, as expected, I mean, it's a AAA+ movie, a blockbuster made by Disney, it's pretty obvious that the effects is going to be good.Overall, I enjoyed The Last Jedi, it's a good Star Wars movie, has let me excited to see Rise of Skywalker, can't wait to see the conclusion of this epic saga, and it's was a fun ride. I'm kinda sad that people can't enjoy a movie anymore because it was not how they imagined it was going to be, and it's sad the harassment that RJ and some of the cast is receveing from the 'fans', I mean, it's JUST A MOVIE, get over it. The movie has its flaws and bad things, but it was good and enjoyable, and one of the Star Wars films that I like the most.",8,5,28,9 September 2019
The Dark Knight," Proving that Comic Book Movies can be more
","It surprises me that 12 years has passed since this film was released, and no other film of the super-hero genre have surpassed this one in terms of quality. Not one of the MCU, neither of the DCEU. Of course, we had great super-heroes films, but the Dark Knight have something else. I think it's the philosophical part. Not trying to be 'deep' or play the smart one, it's just the part that captivated me the most. The idea of Batman being the 'ugly hero', the monologue of Gordon in the ending of the film is outstanding and one of the reason I love Batman. Joker, that is heavily based on the version of the graphic novel Killing Joke of Alan Moore. The agent of chaos and anarchy that have a twisted vision of the world. The 'madness is like gravity' phrase have the same concept of this quote of The Killing Joke 'All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.' Of course there's more than that, I loved Harvey Dent, Joker's 'social experiment' moment is just so powerful. The concept of a hero defeating the villain not with punchs and kicks, but proving that his view of world and ideology are both wrong, is just fantastic and I knew Christopher Nolan wouldn't gave us less than that.About the rest, that makes this film even more interesting. Of course Nolan's directing, he's not that good at action sequences, but nothing you can't ignore. The amazing soundtrack of Hans Zimmer, his music brings the build-up necessary to increase the tension and adds more emotions to the film's most memorable moments. There's much more things that makes this film so great, but the charm is without doubt Heath Ledger's acting, a groundbreaking perfomance, he steals every scene he's in, he's charismatic, even portraying a sociopath, his laugh, the mannerisms, everything about his character is great. One of the few comic book films that are a masterpiece, but if they all were this good, gems like this film wouldn't as relevant as it is.",10,2,3,7 January 2020
The Witch," Finally something fresh in the horror genre
","You probably know already that The VVitch is not like the many formulaic horror films out there, with jumpscares and other clichés.I am not a fan of morror films, mostly because I am easily scared, but this one is fantastic and for my taste. I was not scared during the movie, I saw it during daytime, so this made things easier, watching it at night would not do me good. The beauty of this film is, for me, the atmosphere, taking place in the XVII century, packed with many thee and thou, with a religious puritan family, and the psychological horror, you don't if what you see is something supernatural or not, until the last thirty minutes obviously. Some scenes are disturbing, yet subtle, I think, and this is why I loved this film. I liked all the characters, most of them were used in the best way possible, didn't like the twins. Anya-Taylor Joy and Ralph Ineson, his voice suited perfectly with the film concept, were great here. The disturbing aspect, the tension, the moments that were unsettling, the build-up, everything here is great. The costume design, the production design, the soundtrack, the cinematography here, it is perfect, and looks like the film was shot during the 17th century, it was so emmersive, at least for me, I am a history fanboy so the experience was amazing.Oh, and Black Phillip. One more reason to love this film.",9,3,4,2 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best movie of the prequels trilogy
","Revnge of the Sith, the last movie of the prequels trilogy, showed to be the best of all three. It was darker, funnier and had more character development than the others. It also had cringe moments, something recurrent in the prequels trilogy, but in this one had only a few. The acting of Ian McDiarmid is really good, and seeing the ''birth'' of the Emperor was a cool moment. Lots of great moments, the space battle set in the beginning of the movie, the duel of Kenobi and General Grievous, Order 66, Yoda vs Palpatine, the duel in Mustafar and the birth of Darth Vader. The movie also nailed when we talk about the techinal stuff, the soundtrack is amazing, as is expected of John Williams, the visual effects are better, the production design nailed it with Mustafar and Utapau, both designs are incredible and feel like Star Wars. The acting of McGregor and Christensen improved a lot, the pace of the movie is perfect, it's a crescendo, things scale progressively as best as could be, and in the end you're satisfied. George Lucas, at least, made things right in the prequels trilogy, and thanks that was in the last and most important chapter of this trilogy.",8,2,3,28 August 2019
Wonder Woman," Another great super-hero origin story by DC
","I didn't remember how good this movie is. This is a fine super-hero origin story. This is clearly inspired by Donner's Superman, and it has the charm of the first Raimi's Spider-Man movie. And Gal Gadot, who would thought, is the ultimate incarnation of Wonder Woman. The first thing that will be in my mind if I hear or see about this character, will be Gal Gadot's face. Patty Jenkins direction is amazing, same thing with the photography. Oh, and Wonder Woman's theme is badass.",9,5,23,16 February 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," The perfect ending to the perfect trilogy
","The last chapter of Nolan's Batman trilogy is phemomenal, remarkable, fun, with solid performances and the freshness and criativity you expect in a Nolan film. Unfortunely, it's so underappreciated. The end of a art work, books and films and other narrative media can be challenging, and many fail, but Nolan nailed it in this one. I know it has its mistakes, but the film delivered what it proposed, and it delivered gloriously.The score of Hans Zimmer, so memorable, elevates the film and without it the film would lose half of its magic. Bane is iconic, when you stop to think about this film, Bane will be the first thing that you will remember, and part of the charm is his voice, Tom Hardy is great here. Batman of course is great here, his fall and his rise were done in a magnificent way. There's so much good things here, the directing, cinematography, I watched with the IMAX ratio and it was fantastic. The opening, the first fight between Bane and Batman. Everything here is so greatly done. It was the ending this trilogy deserved and needed.",10,3,3,18 January 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," If only more super-hero movies could be like this one
","Batman v Superman is the proof that Zack Snyder does comic book adaptations like no one else. From 300 to Watchmen, movies that are very faithful to its source material, and then Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, both inspired by DC's classic stories, but at the same time provides a new look at those iconic characters. BvS is an uncoventional super-hero movie, it is 3 hours long (the Ultimate Edtion, and the only one that counts), and the first half of the movie is kinda slow-burning, and the final half is just megalomaniac, the most Zack Snyder thing Zack Snyder ever done, as good as the final fight sequence between Superman and Zod in Man of Steel. Snyder, Goyer and Terrio also did a great job in making a sequel to Man of Steel, even with the presence of Batman and Wonder Woman, the theme of how Superman would affect us, putting him in the real world, is continued and developed, and we see a conflicted Superman again.Unfortunetely, this movie is so misunderstood. The themes of hope, fear, power and sacrifice present here are powerful and it's why this movie is so special, at least in the super-hero subgenre, where the majority of the movies have this cartoonish look, while this movie is a mature work, like Watchmen, The Dark Knight and Logan. Here we have a Superm dealing with criticism and fear. People fear his powers, what he can do, and because of that he loses confidence, seeing Superman dealing with that is one of the high points of the movie. We also have the 'controversial' Batman, one of the high points of the movie as well. Zack Snyder's vision for the character is great, his arc is phenomenal. This is an older Batman, embittered, as seen in The Dark Knight Returns of Frank Miller, filled with rage and fearing what Superman could do, he feels powerless, in his nightmares he is haunted by the world engine sound, he has PTSD. His redemption arc is great. He went from '20 years in Gotham Alfred, we've seen what promises are worth, how many good guys are left? How many stay that way.' to 'Men are still good, we fight, we kill, we betray one another, but we can rebuild we can do better, we will. We have to.' And then there is Lex Luthor, who is also controversial, many didn't like this version of the character, but I think this is the best version so far in film. Gene Hackman version can be summed up as a rich guy with a thing for real estate, but here we have a Lex Luthor with a more convicing motivation, that touchs Epicurean Paradox, he seeing Superman as the reflection of his own insecurities, but Luthor hates Superman mainly because he is the embodiment of power. There is so many more great aspects about this movie, the cinematography, the costume design, Batman have a badass and comic accurate suit, as well as Wonder Woman, the incredible coreography, principally in the one shot fight sequence in Batman's Knightmare, the magnificent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL, and so on.BvS is amazingly well done, the mature tone and themes, terrific character arcs, stunning megalomaniac fight sequences and a great cinematography make this movie one of the best of the superhero subgenre.",8,5,7,5 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A pretty solid movie... I don't understand the sudden hate
","The Force Awakens, seventh episode of the Star Wars franchise, debuted in 2015, and I remember all the hype and how everyone was excited, after all, Star Wars faced a hiatus of 10 years, the last movie was Revenge of the Sith, in 2005. But most of the people were excited to see Luke, Leia and Han again in the big screen, and know what happened to the galaxy after Return of the Jedi. In the opening week of the film, I remember all the buzz. Critics are good, the audience loved, and everybody wanted to see what'll come next to Star Wars. Well, 4 years later, and I decided to rewatch the movie. Like in 2015, I enjoyed the movie. The movie is well directed, thanks to JJ Abrams, the writing is fine, the pace and the editing is amazing , the acting was on point, the visual effects are astonishing, but that is predictable, and from my point of view, that makes The Force Awakens a good and enjoyable movie, how I said in the title, it was solid.But I was surprised when I saw the user reviews here. Just negative reviews and desnecessary hate on the movie. I knew that The Last Jedi is controversial, but I didn't expect to see the same hate on Force Awakens, I mean, I remember everyone loving 4 years ago. One of the most criticized aspects of the movie was the lack of 'original ideas'. Ok, I see, Tatooine = Jakku, Rey = Luke, Death Star Plans = Map to Luke S., First Order is the new Empire, Kylo Ren is the new Vader, I guess, and the Death Star returned, now as the Starkiller Base. This is understandable, the film would benefit from more original stuff, but everyone here is just seeing the negative side. Rey is a good character, and although her is not developed as it could, this the first movie of a trilogy, characters will grow and we'll their journey. Kylo Ren is fine, but lacks from real motivation and a REAL personality, Poe is not developed at all, Finn's arc will be developed in The Last Jedi, I mean, what's the problem again? The trio of this new trilogy is not as charismatic as the original trio, but that doesn't make them bad.The film has more flaws, as it have more good points, but everyone now is just seeing throw the bad one. The Force Awakens is a good movie, feels like Star Wars, is a deserved return to the universe we know and love, and don't deserve the hate it's getting. I think that with the time, this film will be more appreciated, it's no Citizen Kane, but it's a enjoyable blockbuster and a great Star Wars movie.",8,3,23,4 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The movie that changed pop culture
","In 1977 Star Wars was released and 40 years after its release, pop culture still feels the impact that Star Wars brought it. Fantasy and sci-fi was combined in this classic cult, but the most charming thing about this movie is its characters, although being just introduced and not developed, but that's not a problem at all, in the following episodes they gained more development and deepth. Luke, Han, Leia and Kenobi were all interesting characters, and C3PO and R-2D2 are the most charismatic characters of the movie. Darth Vader, with such a magnificent and well-done design, have a strong presence in screen and keeps you interested about what are his motivations and backgroung, aside from what Obi-Wan told about him in the beginning, we don't know so much about the character.The movie is something unique and keeps you captivated from the very first minute, first with the opening crawl text, and then with the Rebellion's ship looking so small before the imposing and powerful Star Destroyer of the Empire, and now on you're on great piece of pop art. George Lucas marvelously manage to entertain with his space opera adventure, inspired by the Flash Gordon films, and the movie follow 'The Hero's Journey' structure, from the work of Joseph Campbell 'The Hero with a Thousand Faces', structure that now are already done beacause of its countless uses.The visual effects, something pioneering from its time, are astonishing, even to today's standards, I think, and of course I'm removing the changes that George Lucas has it done in the DVD and Blu-Ray releases, as the addition of Jabba the Hutt.The soundtrack of John Williams adds SO MUCH to the film. The theme song of Star Wars is something that everyone knows because of how iconic it is, and sounds like a anthem. The scene when Luke is looking at the sunset of Tatooine, and then The Force Theme begins to plays, is really, really something special and out of this world, and I know that everyone had goosebumps when seem it.The cultural relevance of Star Wars will continue to the foreeable future, and it's all thanks to George Lucas and this incredible movie, that will be relevant to generations to come. A New Hope is timeless, wonderful and one of the best fantasy movies to ever exist.",9,3,4,29 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A truly masterpiece and the best film of the original trilogy
","The Empire Strikes Back, sequel to A New Hope, is fairly considered by many as the best movie of the Star Wars saga, because the film presents exciting fresh ideas, a more mature tone, it's mindblowing, fun as hell and is presents everything what makes people love Star Wars.The characters are better here than before, in A New Hope. Darth Vader is more intimidating, looks cooler and in every scene where he is, he's being badass and that's makes everything better. The relantioship of Leia and Han is just perfect, every scene of them interacting is really fun to watching and the time passes just too fast. The training of Luke in Dagoba, with Yoda, shows why Star Wars is the phenomenon it is, because embraces the weird stuff with pride, fantasy and sci-fi at their best. Lando is a charismatic character, and even by what he's done, you can't feel angry about him. It's great to see Luke's journey evolving, and reaching the apex in Return of the Jedi.The visual effects here are better than in A New Hope. The Battle of Hoth is amazing, the AT-AT walkers were so damn perfect, makes it everything better, and the photography of the whole sequence is great, as in the whole movie itself, the sountrack, again, as in the movie itself. Every aspect of the movie deserves compliments.The most remembered scene of the movie, the revelation that Darth Vader is Luke's father, is revolutionary, mainly because of the date when the movie was released, is that what I mean when I said exciting fresh ideas. The movie is worthy of a second watching, and even more. It's impossible to get sick of it. It's not the greatest film ever made, and it doesn't need to be, The Empire Strikes Back has everything that is needed and more. It's a classic film and deserves all the love that receives.",10,0,2,29 August 2019
