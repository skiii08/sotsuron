The Blair Witch Project," Good movie,GREAT concept and promotional push
","Now somewhat expected in scary movies,around 1998 filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez made the daring and clever move of not only creating a singular camera,FX-free horror film with unknown actors(which may've as much been the end product of being relative first-timers of movie making as it would be credited to being ingenious,to be sure)but also going to work promoting the film as if it were a real occurrence,replete with its own website,its own history,documentation,and plenty(and I mean PLENTY)of interviews and fake newscasts. By the time of it's running,thru a number or film festivals and word-of-mouth promotions thru the early part of 1999,the movie was a virtual dynamo of anticipation when it finally landed in commercial theaters a week or two after the 4th of July that year.For the most part,it feels like a lot of invention and inspiration for a movie that,while inspired and effective enough,seems to be really challenging the viewer to love it or hate it. When I first saw it eleven years ago,I was much more in the 'love it' camp. Upon re-watching it in full more recently,I'd more put it in the 'solid like' category.Treated,at its broad-frame as a sort of 'Super documentary',it portends to show the film of an attempted documentary of three film students from Baltimore(Heather Donahue,Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard--all using their real names and not seemingly attempting to show any distinction that would give them away as actors)who go on the trail of the rural legend of the Blair Witch,an 18th century woman who was cast into the woods of post-colonial Maryland,only to disappear and somehow,foist curse on the locals in neighboring towns. After roughly eight days of being lost in the woods somehow,the three understandably lose their cools,rationale and eventually much more as their uncanny knack to be tracked by someone(or something)in the woods has them unable to think clearly and,ultimately,escape.Plenty of 'cinema verite' and improvisation(supposedly,the directors made the actors merely react to situations by leaving index cards along the woods telling them of what was happening next)made this simultaneously one of the more organic and unnerving films made.My lessening of enchantment of this movie is mostly from the passage of time,a chance to digest all the elements of the film/story and the re-evaluation of camera and filming tactics,which,while appreciable for their lack of excess and attention to more intangible fear and atmosphere,seem to be challenging the viewer in ways that threaten to break the viewing experience as well as enhance it.Extras on the DVD are a real plus:getting to see much of the back-story attached to this show is a largely satisfying element(and also gives me some insight into a couple of less-than-flattering reviews)to accompany a film that may seem a bit thin or 'naked' on its own. An inspiration for ensuing 'shocker' movies to come(Cloverfield,Quarantine,Paranormal Activity,The Last Exocrcism come to mind),this movie is worth a look,though the cleavage of opinion on it is gonna be quite difficult to overcome. Back then,a near ten;now,a weak seven. A keeper? You be the judge.",7,0,2,8 September 2010
Changeling," More great storytelling,courtesy of Eastwood and company
","**SPOILERS POSSIBLE**Working Single Mom Christine Collins(Angelina Jolie,who's probably too pretty to play ANYONE from real life,but oh well)lives for two things:her job as a manging receptionist for the switchboards at AT&T(?)in Los Angeles,and her son Walter,a bright but somewhat downbeat nine-year-old. When he comes up missing after an unplanned workday--a Saturday,as it was--Christine does what any distressed mother does,she goes through the proper channels to find him. What happens to her ensuing is something that shouldn't happen to anyone.Clint EAstwood's latest directorial effort is both something very familiar to his work(think UNforgiven,maybe Bridges of Madison County,Million Dollar Baby)and yet something that is wholly unique. To call this a kidnapping story,a story about police corruption,a women's plight movie,a crime mystery or a meditation on loss would miss the mark,because in truth this movie is really a big stew of ALL of those concepts. Adapted off a book by J.Michael Stracynzski(spelling?),Eastwood's simple filming is able to capture reactions and emotions as cleanly as possible. Jolie is mesmerizing as the mother,and even though I realize she seems to be happier playing 'kick-butt' type roles,her ability to play vulnerability(she cries about as good as any A-list actress out there today!)is priceless. While I'm not sure I would've placed slow-burning actor John Malkovich as the muck-racking aggravating Presbyterian minister,he carries out this role with convincing,empathetic and intelligent controlled rage. Much of the cast is not what you'd probably call main-line or even vaguely recognizable talent,but that's maybe the great beauty of the film:character actors who don't distract from their characters. Some notable veterans who come to mind in this film(to me anyway)are 'Burn Notice''s Jeffrey Donovan(as the conscience-free Police Captain who seems more interested in putting off people like Christine Collins and keeping his unit un-burdened), Amy Ryan(normally lovely and well-scrubbed,as a hardened,roughed-up prostitute that's been 'dealt-with' by the LAPD),Colm Feore(as the politically aware,corruption oblivious--willfully so--Police chief),Peter Gerety(As the quack doctor,hired to basically put official wraps on loose-ends for the Force)and Michael Kelly(As the one detective in the Force who actually seems more interested in investigating a case than covering his behind). A great attention to time period(late 1920s and early-to-mid-1930s Calfornia,mostly)and EAstwood's spare usage of music(mostly instrumental horn JAzz,BTW)fills this out beautifully.Some tie-ups with the plot and a little predictability in the dialog makes this JUST shy of perfection,but still the fantastic filming,which enhances the storytelling technique,is what makes this very special. While I'm not one to usually make declarations of a film's worthiness of the Oscar or any other award out there,if one wanted to offer this up as 'Best Picture' of the year,I certainly wouldn't object. Highly recommended!",9,5,9,6 November 2008
Scarface," Say Hello to....film infamy!!!
","The Al Pacino of film before Scarface could be a study in rising tension through the large,scared-yet-determined and world weary brown eyes of a strange but charismatic actor. The Pacino of post-Scarface seems to be heavier on World-weariness,rising VOLUME and generally less conflicted character study(some exceptions:Sea of Love and Insomnia). To me,this movie sort of is the watershed his career;in other words,what you the viewer could expect from him started to turn after this film.Undoubtedly,this movie is meant to be as one-note,over-the-top and stinging as piece devoted to crime drama and gangsters as possible. Cribbing the same rise-and-fall of the gangster as anti-hero as the 1932 classic,Brian DePalma's direction of OLiver Stone(neither of whom would know subtlety if the definition were read to them)'s screenplay,charting the rise and fall of Cuban ex-pat Tony Montoya(Pacino,seething and fidgety from scene one),who is one among thousands of faces that were dumped on our shores during the period in Spring of 1980 when Fidel Castro had decided to 'clean up' his country AND stick it to his northern,non-Marxist neighbors by loading up all the undesirables of the nation and leaving them on the shores of Miami.From the get-go,MOntoya wants to be something special,something powerful,something strong and he knows that this country he's been sent to eyes him with suspect and contempt,so he believes(perhaps correctly)that his best avenues for 'making it' in the land of the free and home of the brave is to pick up in the drug trade. Along with his best friend Ramon(Steven Bauer),he goes about rising through the ranks of Miami's drug-world until HE is the numero uno in the trade. Of course,with a rise this turbulent and violent,coupled with Tony's own paranoia and delusions,this rise and ascent will not be long and the denouement will not be without a VERY bloody price.Featuring memorable turns of support by Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio(in a particularly memorable role IMO as Tony's sister,for whom his loyalty and love borders incestuous),Michelle Pfeiffer(as his less-than-enthused girlfriend),Robert LOggia(as a stubborn boss who uses Tony as he mistrusts him)and F.Murray Abraham(pre-Oscar),this movie never intends to be particularly thoughtful or methodical.This is meant to hit a note,and give a larger-than-life screen talent like Pacino a chance to chew scenery,and it works on both counts.This is a sledgehammer treatment of the early '80s world of drug crime,and whether you clutch this film to your bosom or not,it is vastly effective. Film infamy in the form of everyone from average Joe video gamers to ESPN anchors using quotes from it only make that more evident.",8,0,1,31 January 2007
Frost_Nixon," The Interview...as a boxing ring
","I'm actually old enough to JUST vaguely recall when this interview happened and the publicity surrounding it. I was a small kid at the time,and I seem to recall that David Frost had returned to American television with some sort of comedy/variety series that was set to run as a summer replacement. I even recall seeing some clips of the interview,seeing former President Nixon break down into tears when being asked if he was sorry for mistakes made. Of course,at the time I wondered 'Whoa.I wonder what's making that grown-up cry? It must've been bad.' Keep in mind,I was starting Kindergarten that fall.As I grew up and learned steadily more about President Nixon,the significance of this interview became much clearer. By the time the play,then the movie(both penned by Peter Morgan)came out,I was very intrigued to check this out,both as a one-time student of Politics and of Film.Director Ron Howard takes pains to round out the story,giving both main characters a sort of 'How they got here' prompting. Nixon(Frank LAngella,in a career 'rocket fuel' performance that is DEFINITELY award-worthy),by 1977,had been so roundly disgraced and vilified that a 'Family Feud' survey question taken circa 1975 had listed the top ten most hated and feared people. Hitler,Benedict Arnold,Stalin,Fidel Castro and Satan actually came in BEHIND Nixon,who was the number one answer. Yet,somehow,in the nearly three years since resigning the office of President,'Tricky Dick' was almost able to put WAtergate behind him and--as strange as this may sound to some--actually had designs on resurrecting his political career. About to write his memoirs and somewhat reclusive, The 37th President actually seemed to be in position to make yet another recovery.Meanwhile,accomplished playboy TV host and one-time journalist David Frost(Michael Sheen,in a word:Excellent!)seems to be in a slump. Unable to establish shows in two continents and struggling to hold on to one in a third,his lavish,'Devil may care' lifestyle is possibly behind the eight ball,given that the money for said lifestyle is bound to run out some time. At some point after Nixon's leaving the White House,Frost gets the gutsy idea to do a sit down interview with the disgraced former President. The idea is met with cool skepticism by Frost's long-time producer and erstwhile friend(MAtthew McFayden),but Frost's determination eventually draws him a deal to get the interview. From there,he teams with a TV veteran producer(Oliver PLatt)and a vested academic(Sam Rockwell) to develop the heft and setting for this 'meeting of minds'. At the onset,it would seem a mismatch:Accomplished,well-studied and masterful Nixon versus the perceived lightweight television impresario Frost. But that,needless to say,is where the story picks up.With some nice,if perhaps easily overlooked,supporting efforts from Kevin Bacon(as Nixon's loyal,Post-Presidency aide),Rebecca HAll(as Frost's love interest at the time who would eventually be his wife)and Toby Jones(as eccentric literary agent Irving 'Swifty' Lazar),the assemblage of actors all hit their notes more than adequately(if perhaps somewhat ham-fisted at points). The movie's principle strength is in the verbal jousting between the two main figures:crisp and humored,yet always bristling with some element of attack or defense. Fortunately,the movie leaves the meat of the story in this very element.I've read some thread posters on this sight use such dismissive language of this film as 'Who cares about Nixon?' and 'Why does this matter?'. Some years ago(pre-G.W.Bush,mostly),I would've been more inclined to jump in proclaim something to the tune of 'THe President isn't above the law and Nixon should be an example of why',with more enthusiasm and passion. Lately,I've come to believe that a play/movie like Frost/Nixon serves more of two things: a study in how arrogance,from anyone,can be one's downfall and that even something as seemingly mannered and civilized as an interview can actually be as savage and brutal as any brawl or type of hand-to-hand combat. Anything more is probably subjective.",9,3,6,2 February 2009
Walk the Line," Not quite 'Ray...with white people',but...
","...the similarities are there. This biopic of another music legend,this time Johnny Cash, uses about the same map of storyline: popular-but-troubled superstar comes from very poor backgrounds(Ray Charles from rural,tenant farming Northern Florida,Johnny from rural,dirt-farming Arkansas),both witness traumatic events involving their brothers(Ray's brother drowns to death in front of him,Johnny's brother is sawed in half and bleeds to death in front of him),both take up music as somewhat of a pipe-dream,both find love with women who are far more straight-laced than they(Ray's wife Della Bea and Johnny's second wife,June Carter,are singers in gospel traditions. Johnny's first wife,Vivian,is a conservative,non-entertainment involved housewife),both endure spiraling drug addictions,both bottom out,both reach 'defining moments' and both rise above their lowest moments with the help of family and TRUE friends.Director JAmes Mangold's movie is something that frames the man and legend of the Man In Black very nicely,period. Throw in Reese Witherspoon's subtle,pained performance as June Carter(soon-to-be Cash) and nice turns from Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne as Johnny's folks,RAy and Carrie Cash. It,also like Ray,is almost entirely a film built about and around the main character,so it seems to be tough to separate it from its star,so Joaquin Phoenix has a HUGE burden of carrying this film as Cash,and while he isn't quite as indistinguishable from his character as Jamie Fox seemed to be from Ray Charles,he still fills out Cash's shoes more than adequately and gives you some emotional depth that is necessary to make this film feel right. Fans of Cash will especially feel edified by this picture,but even people who may not quite be fans of the legend should get something out of seeing this,too.",8,4,6,25 April 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," No real Kazhaks here,just gutsy comedy
","English comic-actor Sacha Baron Cohen takes one of his famous stable of characters,Kazahkstani journalist Borat Sangdiev,and sends him on a cross-country odyssey of America that is as scattered in its logic as it is wildly funny.Kazhakstan is fictionalized to the point that I have no doubt that any real native of the country will be less-than-pleased with this portrayal. Here we have a fourth-world country of abject poverty and warped social values(for examples:evidentally,prostitution is not only tolerated but is rewarded,and the town rapist is as common as one would consider a town doctor or sheriff)where the customs include such barbaric practices as abusing animals for sport,killing gypsies and collecting their tears(to ward away AIDS,one reasoning)and their fear of Jews,as demonstrated in their 'Running of the Jews' festival(similar to Spain's 'Running of the Bulls'). Borat leaves his homeland behind(not to mention his angry,abusive wife,his jealous neighbor,his grown son and the large Holstein cow he lives with)to do a report for the one television station,one on that great glorious nation of the U.S.of A.Once in America,the tour-de-force picks up as can be inferred by the ads. From his inability to get anyone in New York to warm up to his lack-of-personal space mannerisms,to his crusade to win over 'The Virgin Pamela Anderson'(for whom he falls in love with while watching a new and mystical television show on his first day in NYC:'Baywatch')at a Virgina mega-store signing in Los Angeles. Along the way,he busts up everything from a bright redneck rodeo in the deep South to a gentile dinner party in Mississippi(?),finding a way to fraternize with inner-city black kids and some USC drunk-boys returning from Spring Break. All the bits are quite funny and a nervous stay at a Bed&Breakfast run by Jews that has Borat and his producer(Ken Davitan) scared enough to believe that the roaches in the room are the hosts transformed and a knock-down,drag-out fight Au naturel being uproarious as well as painful to watch simultaneously.Director Larry Charles,mostly known for his work on TV,particularly 'Seinfeld',makes this look as seamless and mockumentary as possible. A review(it was either Rolling Stone or Entertainment Weekly)described this as(and I'm paraphrasing)a socio-political version of 'Jackass' and that may be the most accurate way I could encapsulate it. Cohen's seemingly innocent yet crass foreigner is as able to draw out the awkward,unplanned funniness out of mostly innocent folks(a dumbstruck drivers'Ed instructor,a 'gypsy'woman holding a garage sale)and skewer those who are far,far from innocent(a sleazy car dealer;a racist,pig-headed rodeo exec;the drunken frat-boys mentioned earlier). I'm not sure there's a clear reasoning or moral to this show,but I do get the feeling that the filmmakers were only hoping to give you a broad idea of how bigotry and ignorance is as much domain of the U.S. as it is any backward,poverty-stricken,culturally backwater country. Otherwise,this is mostly a comedy of cultural disconnect. Cohen(a quiet,educated Jewish gentleman,BTW) is excellent here,as his commitment to character is brilliant. I won't recommend this movie to just anyone.Those who have a wicked,dangerous sense of humor with brains,though,I would highly steer towards this.",10,11,31,21 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Not easy being green...again. {{Spoilers??}}
","I was always a little curious as to why,of all the directors in the world,the producers of the 2003 big screen treatment of the Hulk chose Ang Lee. Sure enough,after seeing that version in the theater,while I wasn't entirely turned-off by that version,I came away wondering why what should've been a fun,rip-roaring adventure with everyone's favorite green,muscle-bound beastie formed from gamma rays and brought on by anger/adrenaline was,instead,something of a sort of florid,artsy and visceral film that only 3/4 of the way through remembered that it was a comic book character it was trying to cover and then tried to make up for it.This version didn't leave me feeling that way at all.I know much less about Louis Letterier,except that he's a relatively new director whose previous efforts were basically adrenaline-packed action films(The Transporter series,I think),but with that knowledge,I know he's perfect for this.Picking up from Dr.Bruce Banner's retreat in hiding in South America--specifically,Brazil--after the horrific gamma accident,the erstwhile quiet and unassuming scientist(Edward Norton,maybe a little too good for this type of role,but he does it NO disservice whatsoever)tries in vain to quietly live an existence of meditation and finding a cure for his situation,but that won't last(or else there's no movie). From there,it becomes a transcontinental pursuit between and among Banner,General Thunderbolt Ross(William Hurt,separated at birth from Ted Levine here),Bruce's lost love Betty Ross(Liv Tyler,soothing the savage beast)and the mysterious 'Mr.Blue' that Bruce is trying to work a 'cure' with. Into the mix is 'Super Soldier' Emil Blonsky(Tim Roth,who's never met a nefarious role he doesn't like,it seems),a fierce fighter whose interest in the Hulk threatens to turn him into something just as or more dangerous. Come to think of it,this movie could(accent COULD)be considered a sequel to the first version,since its line of events doesn't vary or completely contradict the Ang Lee version. But otherwise,this is more treated as a 'do-over' and that's just fine by me. This treatment seems more accurate.The summary line basically comes from the fact that it's truly tough to translate this creature or action accurately without either A)sacrificing character in favor of CGI and ear-splitting boom or B)becoming so entranced in the whos and whys that the appeal of the show gets diluted. I,were I the director,would err on the side of the former(which this show sorta does),since that's probably what most audiences will go for. The screenplay and plot are neither that bad or that good. And that's just fine so long as it serves the Dr.Bruce Banner/Incredible Hulk in the way those who've enjoyed the comics and/or TV show are acquainted. This film achieves that aim amicably.",8,2,3,18 June 2008
Miracle," Very uplifting and remarkably restrained,for Disney
","This latest offering to Disney's cannon of live action films,following 2002's 'THe Rookie',actually is able to do one better to the genre of Amazing Sports Cinderella Story by making the events of a very real,very legendary moment in Olympic and American sports history into a very tangible,almost ordinary and tension-filled occurrence.Kurt Russell,more known for his physical,tough performances in actioner flicks,sci-fi cult films and light comedies,shines in this film as the late University of Minnesota(and NHL?)coach Herb Brooks,who is charged with the daunting task of cobbling together an Olympic team for the 1980 Winter games in Lake Placid. His problem: he has to do it with a fresh batch of amateurs(i.e.college kids) and he has a grand total of nine months to do so. Even though the goals of the USOC is to simply put a team on the ice that won't embarrass the country in the games,Brooks,a reservist on the 1960 US Olympic Hockey team that won the Gold(and thus a driving plot point for his character),has his goals set higher. He wants nothing less than to medal,and knocking off the Russian team--a program that had not only won the gold the last four winter games(1964,1968,1972 and 1976),but was sporting a team that had been laying waste to all competitors for the better part of the last decade and were probably sporting pros,guys who had played together for years,thus giving them an added edge.Russell's Brooks is a difficult character to peg.Watching this film,you discover his coach is not an easy man to relate to or like at all times. He is driven,stubborn and single-minded enough to test the loyalty of even his most fierce defenders. BUt he is also the quintessential 'True Believer',meaning he is willing to go to the mat to push for the best out of the diamond in the rough sort players that are facing high odds. PAtricia Clarkson's turn as his patient wife is another deftly crafted performance(She's also very good in 'Pieces of April' and to a lesser degree in 'Far From Heaven'). Her impact maybe more subtle on the movie,but it no less necessary. NOah Emmerich holds up his end of the deal as the assistant coach Craig Patrick,who shows more with body language and facial expressions than words. Rounding out the main players and contributors to the movie are the kids playing the team. I was interested to notice through reading the bios that many of these youngsters were not only fairly new at acting but were very experienced hockey players as well. The characters themselves,real and very sympathetic,are given just enough character to flesh out the movie. The characters of Eruzione(the Captain),O'Brien and O'Connell are given the most shrift,since they have the most pivotal stories or roles on the team.LAstly,and most importantly,this film succeeds in that it stretches the tension of a story that the ending is already well-known. By grinding down the elapsed time of the team's progress,from exhibitions,through Olympic trials and finally,the games themselves,to each shot-by-shot,check-by-check,goal-by-goal,reaction-fixed moment of the game itself,as well as the moments before the game,at the intermission,and even the moments immediately after,the show's director O'Connor is able to raise the emotional levels of the film so as to allow the triumphant,joyous payoff to be strong.Given the emotional pressure points of this movie,Disney actually was fairly restrained in showing the whole effort to gain respect and ultimately victory,which was no mean feat,since Disney seems to butter their bread with movies that are ham-fisted in sentiment,animated or not.While I can't give it a perfect rating,this is still a strong movie that anyone who likes inspirational films will greatly enjoy.",8,0,0,4 May 2005
Mission: Impossible III," Best of the MI movies(so far)
","IMF agent Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise,who else?)has managed to cross(and was crossed by)a vile,vicious arms dealer named Owen Davian(Philip Seymour Hoffman,brilliantly evil here)and he and his woman(Michelle Monaghan)are now in a world of trouble,as we open the third movie of this series. From there,we discover that this has been a war of attrition between Hunt and DAvian,which involves plenty of gunfights,globe-hopping and disguises. Ethan's team in tow(the fantastic Ving Rhames along with Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys-Davies),they feverishly work to achieve said Impossible and,in my opinion,improve upon what was previously a somewhat dry franchise of stylish action and 'Cruise Indulgence'(a term I've coined for any Tom movie where there are a slough of slo-mo action sequences with plenty of shots of the diminutive scientologist in abject pain and struggle). It is the use of more of the 'team' element of M:I in this movie that I prefer this movie the best,since the whole crux of the television series WAS the fact that these were missions that were completed because of a nameless,faceless espionage effort.Kudos to director and co-writer J.J.Abrams for allowing the movie to give more of a spread out form of tension and kinetics. A supporting cast that also features Laurence Fishburne,Keri Russell,Billy Crudup and Simon Pegg are well-placed. This film is pure formula 'Summer actioner' and 'Popcorn flick' so one should shrug off any of the convenient plot hooks that arise in this film(and there are at least a few!). Not great entertainment,and it even possesses some unintentional humor,but the movie works for the genre it represents and unlike the first two MI films(No.1 was convoluted and confusing and No.2 was dry and archingly 'Arty'),it is an easier digest as a big-screen offering.",7,0,1,1 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Still have a fair amount of the marketing involved with this film
","I'll admit that I'm quite the pack-rat when it comes to movie memorabilia,from the normal(posters,stills,ticket stubs,scripts,t-shirts,etc.)to the odd and even worthless(corporate tie-in products like bottles,cans,toys issued by whoever the film is doing a product tie-in),so I am offering this fact up with little or no deserved shame:I own quite a bit of the stuff issued by Pepsi-Cola,Pizza Hut and Taco Bell related to this movie. Cans and game pieces,and as long-since worthless as they are now,I still can't really part with them.Looking back on it now,it seems like this movie probably succeeded much more in the commercial aspect than it did in regards to the movie franchise it was given to pick up the baton for. I recall that the build-up to this film's May,1999 release was HUGE,and the initial two-month business in the US seemed unstoppable,but then,almost twice as quickly as it had built up a following,the business--both box office and later on video--seemed to dry up fairly quickly. That's where my review comes in.The first of the 'pre-quels' to the first trio of director George Lucas' space operas is mostly meant as a set-up back-story for Annakin Skywalker who,while siring someday young restorative Jedi Luke,would also morph into the deformed and evil dark lord Darth Vader. But for now,he's a cute,can-do kid who knows how to build helper droids and racing vehicles.He has the confidence of two Jedi knights--the younger,suspicious Obi Wan(Ewan MacGreggor,subtly limning Sir Alec Guiness)and the older,more positive Qui-Gon Jin(Liam Neeson)--and he gets to show off his skill at the most pivotal plot point. He also wins the friendship of Queen Amidala(NAtalie Portman,blossoming into womanhood)and the doubts of Jedi Elders MAce Windu(Samuel L.Jackson,NOT yelling)and Yoda(voice of Frank Oz,of course),as they seek to liberate both Ani's mother and stop the dark side from unification.Arguably the low end of the Saga pool,it's just entertaining enough to distract,and with plenty of colorful CGI,it's able to do that flawlessly. Complaining about a Star Wars scripted dialog is sort of like complaining about long lines at an Airport,DMV or Bank. To me,the memorabilia of this film still seems more worth collecting,since half the fun of its release was the anticipation of it. Strictly a 'companion' piece for your Star Wars collection series.",6,0,2,31 January 2008
3:10 to Yuma," The Western is back!!(Well,for now,anyway.)
","Since the mid-1970s--I'd say,since about 1976,about the time 'Gunsmoke' went off the air and John Wayne did his last movie--the Western as a genre(for movies AND TV)has been tapped less and less,with sort of a polar divide between edgy,darker,'anti-OAters'(i.e. Unforgiven,'Deadwood') and safe,pat,emotionally provocative('THe Young Riders',American Outlaws,Young Guns I & II)even Politically Correct(I'm thinking mostly of DAnces With Wolves) being the running link between the occasional horse opera fare that would hit popular culture. I suppose in a growing,more diverse culture of movie making,something a distinctly pre-civil rights and(if you make it right)unapologetically un-P.C. as a Western would find less of an audience now than it might've some,say,forty or fifty years ago.So,I suppose it should come as no surprise that instead of making a new Western,the producers of this film decided to bring back this story,culled off an Elmore Leonard short and scripted by Halstead Welles,Michael Brandt and Derek Haas,directed by JAmes Mangold(the able director of Walk the Line). The story of how the paths of two men--the moral,gimped rancher DAn Evans(Christian BAle,another chameleon-like turn)and the calm,measured,cold-blooded and mostly amoral thief and killer Ben Wade(Russell Crowe,like Bale,just shape-shifting into another distinct and strong character)--cross is something as old as High Noon or Shane(particularly the slow build-up of the confrontation between Evans and the small band of locals who are attempting to take Crow to the eponymous train to prison,and Wade's brutal gang),but the saltier language and the drawn out character study make this as contemporary as any other movie genre in this era. Some strong turns by Ben Foster(getting a little TOO good at playing creepy and scary,as a clearly sociopathic and clever second-in-command to Crowe's Wade),Logan Lerman(As the rancher's son),Gretchen Mol(as the rancher's wife),Peter Fonda(As a grizzled Pinkerton bounty hunter)and Alan Tudyk(as a timid Vet who goes along for the ride) give character to this movie. While I cannot call it5 a great movie or a favorite of mine,I found this movie impressive in its scope,feel and intensity,and can't help but feel like if future Westerns(whether original or remade)are put together like this one,I think the genre may see a new up-tick in viewer-ship. In the meantime,3:10 is mostly a rarity,but to me(and I suspect to many moviegoers),a rare film(or anything in general)is seen as a good thing,and that's how I feel for this film.",8,1,2,19 September 2007
The Hangover," Pretty much a composite of every wild,bachelor party story ever told;still very funny
","On a balls-out,let-it-all ride Bachelor party trip to Vegas,friends Stu(Ed Helms,unleashed at long last here to full comedic effect),Phil(Bradley Cooper,a career that's appeared out of nowhere to become money in the bank)and future in-law Alan(Zach Gallifinakis,in my mind the biggest scene thief of this show) run into one small problem after a night of inspired debauchery:the guest of honor,groom-to-be Doug(Justin Bartha,who's sorta there for the film)is missing. And now,three guys whose various poor or short-sighted judgments have left them disoriented and in some legal trouble,must combine their wits to go find their friend and future husband-to-be in an economy of time and an odd,sometimes disturbing set of clues left in wake to help them.Director Todd Phillips,expanding upon the 'bad boys being bad boys' formula that was modestly offered with star power to back it in Old School,now goes for a slightly more modest cast(from Will Ferrell,Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson to Helms,Bartha,Gallifinakis and Cooper)but a more ambitious,raunchier(if that can be believed)and adventurous story to make this largely funny,sometimes hard to believe comedy. A deft usage of actors in supporting roles--among them the now underused Heather Graham as a pleasant,bubbly single mom of infant,who just happens to be a stripper and escort;Ken Jeong as the wiry,foul-tempered and quite possibly gay Asian mobster who has it in for the heroes;Rachael Harris as Stu's brittle,domineering bitch of a girlfriend;and Mike Tyson as,get this,Mike Tyson--highlight this tour de force,and that's not even to mention the near cameos as some not-too-lightweight-themselves talents as Jeffrey Tambor(as the Bride and Alan's dad),Bryan Callen(as a thick-accented wedding chapel proprietor),Sasha Barresee(mostly in one-note fret mode as the unravelling bride-to-be),Mike Epps(as a discombobulated drug dealer),Rob Riggle(as a uniform cop,one of Vegas' NOT finest)and Cleo King(as his equally inept and cruel partner).The summary line notes that this movie,as funny ands sometimes shocking(stay for the credits and try not to be caught at least a little off guard!)as this film is,at its core it is little more than a compendium of wild stories that guys have spun,whether based in truth or no,set around giving their buddies and/or enduring their last night of un-wedded fun. So while the originality of this particular movie isn't all that remarkable,the set-up,follow-through and denouement of it is! Good,raunchy,raucous fun for anyone(guys in particular)who appreciate good,solid immature tomfoolery before settling down and 'becoming mature'. Perfect film-going for summer!",9,2,4,11 July 2009
The Ring," Dark and gloomy horror,imported(in story)from the LandoftheRisingSun
","When the niece of investigative reporter Rachel Keller(Naomi Watts,beautiful and intriguing as always)dies under strange circumstances related to a video cassette and her quiet,shy grad school-age son(David Dorfman)seems to know more about the situation than he should,she decides to investigate what at first seems to be an urban myth.What she uncovers is something of a dark and disturbing riddle that traces to a small island community off the coast of Washington state involving a horse stable owner(Bryan Cox),his wife and his other-worldly daughter,now both deceased. With her ex-husband (Martin Freeman)in tow,Rachel tries to stop whatever it is that's been cursing the video tape before it goes for it's next victims:namely,her ex,her son and herself. This is supposed to be a shot-for-shot American remake of the Japanese horror success Ringu,but since I've yet to see the original,I can only truly judge this film for its own merits. Director Gore Verbiski(spelling?),who would follow this late fall of 2002 hit with another pay-dirt movie in Pirates of the Caribbean,Curse of the Black Pearl,is very good about keeping the scenery and images as gray,rainy and gloomy as possible throughout much of the film(Setting it in Seattle and near Vancouver was a very deft move). This film never strays too far from the concept of imminent peril hanging over anyone unwise enough to mess with the tape. I'd suppose that my problems with this movie mostly stem from the ending,which I will not spoil to you here,only to say that it seems to not tie together the questions of the movie as it would like. In other words,it,to me,seemed to only open up more plot gaps and questions as it sewed up. I will say that might have had to do with the producers wanting to leave room for a sequel,but somehow it feels like that could've been done more cleverly than it was.Still,a good watch for someone who appreciates the more visceral side of scary,tense,compelling movies.",8,1,2,25 October 2006
Stop-Loss," Maybe not a great movie,but an important one
","Movies like this are gonna naturally garner controversy. They are practically made that way. So the message boards are just chock full of people posting opines one way or the other about the Iraq WAr as well as this movie and its relationship to it.A tad unfortunate,really,since this film is more of a snapshot of the situation that is facing our enlisted men and women,and a very potent one at that.It's no mistake,then,that the central character of this moral/civic duty dilemma film is a good 'ol boy from Texas named Brandon KIng(Ryan Phillipe,somewhat of a step back from work such as Crash and Breach),a mid-rank officer in the Army who has bravely served his tour(tours?) of duty in Iraq and arrives back home to his large,red state on the belief that he's home to stay,and having lost enough friends and brothers in arms in battle,he's reach a level of battle fatigue that is largely justifiable. Of course,the title of the film is a foreshadowing of the conflict and tension that is to come,as King(his rank escapes me at the moment.SArgenat?)is Stop-loss-ed,ordered to report back to duty. THree guesses as to how this sits with Brandon and the first two don't count.A great supporting turn by Joseph Gordon LEavitt,as a childhood friend of Brandon's who also served in the Army and is the converse of Brandon:he MISSES being in the trenches and using his battle skills,but the Army has no designs on bringing him back in. Solid turns also by Timothy Olyphant(As a hard-headed,if perhaps one-not CO),Linda Emond(As Brandon's mom),CIaran HInds(blending in as Brandon's quiet but unconditionally supportive dad),Channing TAtum(as Brandon's gung-ho buddy)and Abbie Cornish as the tough,supportive friend who sides ultimately with the hero of the show.Director Kimberly Pierce,who has some family ties to this war(I forget if it was a brother,a cousin,another relative,or whomever is serving or has served),makes no bones about it:she's out to stir some controversy and alert people to issues pertaining to the troops and how the policy and strategy of the war affect them on it. Love it or hate it,agree whole-heartedly or disagree vehemninently,one has to say that this film and story is food for thought,and THAT is definitely the characteristic of an effective and important movie.",8,1,3,3 August 2008
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Only spoiled by unnecessary re-edits on 20th anniversary re-release
","There's really not much to say that hasn't already been said about Steven Spielberg's tribute to lost childhood and unlikely friendships,disguised as a Science Fiction fantasy. It is a beautifully made movie that was very cleverly marketed(i.e. not showing the creature in any of the ads during the first run of the movie). Melissa Mathison's script is spare and,as such,allows for the actors and effects to paint a picture of the story through emotions and images. His cast was comprised of almost entirely character actors,with the children comprising the Lion's share of screen time and lines(along with the creature of course)which seems par for the course for Spielberg,who is almost shameless in his usage of kids and kids' themes to breathe life into his movies.When the 2002 re release of the film came out,I was initially very excited and looked forward to seeing it in a theater again. While I cannot say I was wholly disappointed with the end result(it WAS for the most part,still the same movie),I have to say that I found the changes put into the film--of which I would probably would've been barely aware of,save the E.T. in a bathtub scene,had I not read about it in something like Entertainment Weekly--were unnecessary and created a rather unnecessary buzz that I(And I feel like others)could've done without.I would recommend either the 1997 VHS 15th Anniversary release,complete with edited footage,backstage filming,current star interviews and footage of the 1982 premiere.(If you can find this in DVD form, get it) It's the original untouched film,replete with back-story which,if you get into things like that like I do,you will find interesting.",9,0,0,9 August 2005
Finding Neverland," The delicate situation of a man-child and the legend he creates
","Who'd have thunk that the director to take this adaptation of the play 'The Man Who Was Peter Pan' to the screen would be the same guy who directed 'Monster's Ball'? Then again,who would've thought that the guy who was once Cry-Baby,Edward Scissorhands,Hunter S. Thompson,George Jung or Captain Jack Sparrow would be able to put such a gentle and accurate touch to Pan's creator,James M.Barrie?This offering(a previous commentary was spot-on about this)was a very hyped and Award-ready film,brought to the viewing public by none other than the Weinstein Brothers and Miramax. But still--almost in spite of the publicity overkill--this film is every bit as special and remarkable as its press would have one to believe.Barrie(Johnny Depp)is a frustrated playwright living in London whose chance meeting with an old-monied widow(Kate Winslet) and her four young sons allows for the inspiration he needs,eventually culminating in the creation of the book,then play 'Peter Pan'. The story is,as most stories of famous occurrences,a richer and deeper tale. The play itself is quite a reach for early twentieth century theatrical production,and selling his already skeptical,bottom-line producer(one-time Captain Hook Dustin Hoffman,understated and brilliant as ever here)is a difficult chore. Barrie's marriage to soft-spoken Mary(Radha Mitchell,also proving to be chameleon-like in her career thus far)is already cold and about to grow colder due to her husband's interest in the widow and her sons. Then,there's the complicated relationship between the widow and her sons(among them,Freddie Highmore as Peter,the most stubborn and sullen of the four),which is unusual for any period. Added in the right amount of tension from the protective mother of the widow Sylvia,played with quiet strength by screen veteran Julie Christie. The director and writers rightly gambled on mixing elements of fantasy into the very real story that is brewing here,because without it,it feels like the explanation of a man-child wanting to manifest his simple dreams into real fantasy might seem stilted or truly strange. Instead,it gives it the right amount of understanding and depth.While there are some similarities to another man-child who's become famous for delving into his own never-ending fantasy of youth and adventure while attaining fame and fortune for his own artist endeavors(I won't name names but here's a hint:his name rhymes with Rykol MAckson),what I've read about Mr.Barrie and what just about anyone who has owned a television has heard or learned about the King of Pop tells me that J.M.Barrie's life was considerably less sordid or disturbing than the man recently acquitted in a California court.This film is a wonderful story within a story. Acting,direction,script and effects are all very memorable. Don't let the genteel,costume-type productions fool you:this film is as accessible as it is fanciful. You might even want to bring a hankie,too.",9,0,0,26 June 2005
Friday Night Lights," Texas high school football,warts and all
","What impressed me from the get-go about this movie is the fact that it appears,on first glance,as a ordinary Football movie--a high school football movie in pigskin mad Texas,no less--but upon further examination,this is actually much more of a darker,much much less romanticized(or trivialized)treatment of the game and the people who play,coach and support(parents,family,or just community).Permian High School,nicknamed Mojo,in economically-pressed(though it's never really examined in the film,the viewer only gets the general impression of it) Odessa,Texas, has a football program that has a rich and fairly long history of success,so winning is treated as something of a birthright to anybody living in the city limits and even beyond. All the young men who play it know it,the whole school knows it and the coaches know it,particularly the head coach,one Gary Gaines(Billy Bob Thornton,whose performance is smart and subtle),a stern,insecure and ego-driven man who feels the pressure to win head-on. His job is so tantamount to his livelihood that he's under perpetual threat of being fired for every loss his teams incur(one example: after a particularly damaging loss,'For Sale' signs are posted in his front lawn as a Not-so-subtle reminder).With American football teams normally fielding anywhere from thirty to upwards of fifty players,the story-lines have to be condensed to a handful of personas for focus. They are mostly exemplified in the stories of Mike Winchell(Lucas Black),the put-upon QB with a very sick mother who has hopes of playing collegiately;Boobie Miles(Derek Luke),a brash stud Running Back,who goes from being a lock for big-time college football and beyond to being a nearly hobbled and fully hobbled team supporter;and Don Billingsley(Garret Hedlund),the shy and perceivably under-performing son of a local playing legend(Tim McGraw,excellent!)whose drowning his sorrows in booze when he's not verbally or physically abusing his son. There are other stories,but the movie concentrates mostly on the ascent of the team through a rough but rewarding 1988 season,which culminates in a date with brash,physically daunting Dallas CArter high school.Director Peter Berg seems to dig action and full-surrounding shots of his subjects,capturing every element of pain,grit,frustration,anger,sweat and elation(among other things). HAving not read the best-selling 1990 book by H.G. Bissinger,I have to assume that David Aaron Cohen's screenplay is culled from a chapter-by-chapter,blow-by-blow documentation that is somewhat detached but always true. My subject line comes from the fact that,unlike many sports movies,the coaches,the players and most everyone involved(even down to the broadcasters) are not treated as noble,inspiring or even cute archetypes but more as imperfect,flesh-and-blood people who make mistakes,have prejudices and feed their egos and insecurities. The objective of the movie seems to be not to these people into heroes or examples but rather make Texas football as real and formidable. I have yet to sit through an episode of the well-received NBC TV series based on the movie,but I feel like if it has even half of the grit and honesty as the film,it should be quite good,too.",Null,2,5,27 February 2008
The Big Lebowski," The Dude respects...and so do I.
","I was tempted to christen my summary line 'All he really wanted was his rug back',but I came to the aesthetic decision that that would be a little too cute and arch. Or not. As such,I'm not even entirely sure what 'The Dude respects.' means,but I'm willing to take it as a good thing,and it seemed more fitting to preface a show so oddly appealing and unique.Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski(Jeff Bridges,long past being the handsome blonde leading man of yore,blissfully slobby and relaxed)lives what one might think is an idyllic life: not employed,yet living comfortably in a Southern California condo,whose only real activities seem to be bowling(LOTS of bowling)and toking(ditto that). He drinks(and seems to get his sole nourishment from)White Russians and grooves to early seventies fare(mostly Creedence Clearwater Revival)and seems to coast on a seamless lifestyle,which is rudely interrupted when some greedy nihilists(led by the always reliable creepy Peter Stormare)violate Dude's rug and demand money from him. Of course,they've got the wrong Lebowski;a much richer gentleman,also named Jeffrey Lebowski(what were the odds?)is their real target and he(David Huddleston)becomes the target of Dude's compensation plans. Of course,this will get more complicated when Mr.Lebwoski's nympho trophy wife(Tara Reid,great breakthrough role!)appears to be kidnapped by said nihilists,making the Dude now a seemingly valuable 'go-between'.After all that story,one would figure there'd be plenty with this film but oh no,there's still more,namely,the assortment of characters that the Dude has contact with: Dude's 2nd on the bowling team WAlter Sobchak(JOhn Goodman,grabbing some great lines here),the half-cocked Vietnam vet who also takes his Judaism VERY seriously;Donnie Kerabatsos(Steve Buscemi,recessive for once)the mousy third partner on Dude's team;Big Lebowski(Huddleston),a self-righteous pompous bastard with secrets;MAude Lebwoski(Julianne Moore,Euro-chic and severe),Big Lebowski's artist daughter and co-manager of the family trust,Jackie Treehorn(Ben Gazzara),a smooth porn magnate;Brandt(Philip Seymour Hoffman,when he was still a'anonymous'),a venal toadie for Big Lebowski;of course,the pea-brained nihilists and a mysterious stranger(Sam Elliott,for whom being a cowboy ISN'T acting)who frames the story as well as walks through it.THe Coen Brothers have a rep for making films that don't stay on the proverbial beaten path,and more work('RAising Arizona','Miller's Crossing','FArgo' and last year's 'No Country for Old Men' come to mind)than don't('Blind Date','Barton Fink','The HUdsucker Proxy' seem to fit that).This movie is veritable poster child for that. Adding to the effect of this movie--besides the writing and directions of Coen squared--are Cinematograher Roger Deakins and Composer Carter Burwell(who've worked with the Coens numerous times before),and their touches are masterful. I saw this film again recently,purchasing it as a matter of fact. It doesn't get much 'playback'(i.e. cable re-running)and it's even somewhat of a hard find for the video stores,and yet much of the imagery from the first time I saw it a few months shy of ten years ago has stayed relatively fresh. Funny and poignant,raw yet strangely sensitive,sentimental but not sappy,this movie(and I've said it before,but I think it SO applies to this)is a definite keeper. Another reviewer said it:this film's worth re-watching as many times as one likes and never really gets old. I most certainly respect the Dude!",10,0,1,20 January 2008
Star Trek," Still living long(if not smoothly)and prospering(definitely)
","I call myself a 'reformed Trekkie'. In truth,I'm sort of a 'Weekend Trekkie' or 'Trek hobbyist',following the original with quite a bit of interest as a teen(though,curiously,NOT so devoted as to become one of those mythic conventioneers)and then latching onto 'Next generation' through late high school into college,even following with some interest 'Deep Space Nine' for the first season or two. I lost my interest after that,and despite some efforts to try to hook into the TV relaunch effort that was 'Enterprise',my interest fizzled some then. Then,there were the movies,which varied in quality and entertainment value but still tended to be good 'waste of times's at the very least,with probably The Wrath of Khan(1982),The Voyage Home(1986) and First Contact(1996,and probably the best of the bunch)as the strongest entries.Suffice it to say,when I first heard about J.J.Abrams' attempting to 're-boot' the franchise,I had a certain mix of skepticism and hope. While I wanted to see the franchise return to the big screen,I held the minority opinion that the previous time-line of the show(stretching from Picard,Riker,Troi,Crusher,Data,Worf,et al)and that series of shows SHOULD be continued and not abandoned,so a 'retro' or back story Trek film(pre-dating Kirk,Spock,McCoy,Uhura,Scotty,et al)was not--at least initially--something I really felt was in order. Over time(and what time,indeed:roughly two plus years from announcement of this film to release) I gradually softened to the idea of this film and was,by the time it released,VERY stoked to see it.Overall,and after all that intro,I hacve to say that I was reasonably pleased,though maybe not as 'in love' with this film as many(namely,film critics:it seems to average B+ grades from everyone from Rolling Stone to EW)but certainly not feeling the hate quite a few(mostly the seemingly 50 percent of commentators)have been showing.The plot is neither a secret nor of any great urgency to tell,since it in fact might be the weakest element of this movie,but in a few sentences here it is: The new crew of freshly minted Starfleet grads are thrust into commandeering the Enterprise when their then Captain Pike(Bruce Greenwood)is kidnapped in a failed negotiation attempt. The new crew--a still new but disciplined Spock(Zachary Quinto,maybe the most compelling of the performances of the film),a harried assistant medical officer McCoy(Karl Urban,the Beefier DeForest Kelley,it appears),a 'brilliant' communications junior officer named Uhura(Zoe Saldana)and,last but not least,a 'born-to-lead'baddass named Kirk(Chris Pine,who,I must say,actually DOES fills Bill Shatner's shoes pretty well)--are pitted in battle against a sullen,vicious Romulan named Nero(Eric Bana,under heavy make-up and barely recognizable)out to exact a vendetta against Spock. Okay,did I say a FEW sentences? It would be pure hooey of me to say there wasn't a fair amount of plot machination here that made this movie,if not less palatable,certainly a long walk from excellent. The one example I'll give is the usage of time travel,which not only creates more than its shares of story knots but also threatens to make the back-story pretty mucky from here on out(maybe that's the job of the sequel--sequels--to come). One of the primary reasons, I'm pretty sure,for that aforementioned plot device was to bring Leonard Nimoy in as an older,wiser,more human Spock and,to that end,he doesn't disappoint,as he being the old pro and gravitas that this film full of many young,semi-familiar actors filling out very familiar roles.Director J.J.Abrams may never be confused for a cinematic(or even television)genius,but if there's one thing he DOES know it's how to extract a right amount of visceral enjoyment and adrenaline out of a story(ask anyone who watches 'Lost' on a regular basis;I dare say he did pretty good with an otherwise bloated and overwrought script for Mission:Impossible 3 also).A screenplay that tries to identify the familiar players from classic Trek may strike some as too facile,others as groan-inducing,it still is able to identify the players,put them into motion and make the franchise easy to identify and apply to a less-cheesy template and more 21st-century technological sensibility.Flawed but entertaining,the franchise is doing two out of the three tenets of the famous Vulcan greeting/send-off. Maybe this re-boot will lead to better film entries into the series. It remains to be seen. This one gets a weak eight or very strong seven.",8,2,10,27 May 2009
Dawn of the Dead," Solid film, whether you like horror movies or not
","I just saw this one yesterday on video. I must first off confess that I haven't seen the original 'Dawn of the Dead' except for brief clips(which really shouldn't count). I must say I was impressed.I will also cop to the fact that I am not ordinarily a horror film fan. That isn't to say I haven't seen my fair share of scary flicks be it cheesy and formulaic(i.e. most of the Friday the 13th series,the first 'Poltergeist for examples) or classic('Psycho','Carrie','NIght of the Living Dead' come to mind),but I don't think I could call myself an aficionado of the genre. Having said that,I would recommend this film to either horror buffs and even non-buffs,but the latter on one condition:that you have a high tolerance for gore.By now,you know the scenario:a group of basically ordinary people hide out at a mall,trying to stay safe and stave off a seemingly endless waves of flesh and brain-eating undead. Naturally,a level of claustrophobia envelops the group and it becomes as much a psychological drama as it is an emotional thriller. For all you uber violence fans out there,there's plenty of killing,crashing and explosions to keep you sated. Ving Rhames and JAke Webber really stand out among the survivors here,though I gotta give credit to Sarah Polley for adding a level of thoughtful dignity to her character in a film type she's not ordinarily associated with. A mostly obscure cast(that seems predominantly Canadian!hmmmmn) fills out this cast,exceptions being Mekhi Pfeifer and Matt Frewer(Max Headroom,anyone?). The makeup effects for the zombies are strangely showcased in full in only two parts of the movie: the very beginning and toward the end. The credits were probably consisting of mostly fx,makeup,pyrotech,stunts and cameras.No surprise there really,and they do their jobs superbly!To those who want to see a wild,explosive action/horror hybrid of a film,I recommend it. 8 out of 10 stars.",8,0,0,10 February 2005
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Breaking up really IS hard to do...
","...and for Peter Bretter(Jason Segel,also the screenwriter),it proves to be something akin to a test of his spirit and willpower.Much of the Judd Apatow stable of actors fills out the scenery and situations,the action mostly taking place on the scenic island of Oahu as the lonely,mopey hero of the film seems to be vainly trying to get over his ex of the title(Kristen Bell,tough to forget),a sexy but somewhat shallow and ultimately selfish TV actress and co-star of a CSI type drama. Of course,it only seems news to Peter that the tropical getaway he chooses to escape to was introduced to him BY the girl he's trying to forget,so his incidental bump-in(?!) with her,avec new boyfriend(Russell Brand,stealing this movie),a drippy,sleazy self-important British pop star. But just as his existential dilemma seems to be reaching critical bleakness,Peter trips into the lovely and mildly interested eyes of the pretty hotel desk clerk/concierge(Mila Kunis,completely 360 from her 'That '70s Show' character).As per any film from the Apatow company,there is more than plenty of indelicate relationship/sexual material. While the plot and character transformations take their own sweet time,it's still a mostly fun ride. Plenty of choice supporting players that include a truly repressed Christian newlywed couple(Jack McBrayer and Maira Thayer,fantastic!),a man-crushing Maitre-d(Jonah Hill making the best of a throwaway role)who aspires to be a star musician much like Brand's character,a bad-ass bartender,a low-key native party organizer and a surfer dude who's got permanent stupid(Paul Rudd in what is a hilarious somewhat inflated cameo).NIcholas Stoller directs what could just as well be a 'ghost directing' job for Mr.Apatow,as the wisecracks,naughty material and relationships seem to be grafted straight from such stuff as 40-year old Virgin or Knocked Up. A mildly painful watch for anyone who's been devastated by a break-up,this is still pleasantly raunchy, good-natured and not a waste of about two hours of time. Good fun!",Null,3,6,9 October 2008
Shaun of the Dead," Usage of Queen Music:Always a Bonus!
","I just saw this film a few days ago on video--I don't recall if it ever made it to my hometown,it might've made it to Lawrence,which is 20 plus miles east of here--and was VERY impressed. I found myself drawing comparisons of this show to the remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' remake,which came out both in theatre and video/DVD relatively close to each other. While I liked and was sufficiently entertained by DOTD 2004,I was more impressed with this effort,mostly due to the copious amount of comedy and pathos that gives this zombie flick a little more depth(I also enjoyed this ending more than DOTD's,but that would be a spoiler if I told you why).The English sensibility of this film(i.e. a lot of arguing,a sort of Soccer-hooligan sensibility to its violence)makes the horror element of this film both real and hilarious,no mean feat there! The hero,Shaun,you become familiar with as a basically good guy with low aspirations and a sinking sense of boredom in life. His best friend,Ed,is a disgusting yet amiable loser and his girlfriend,Liz,might seem grating and prattling on first observation,but she is basically kind and sensible,a perfect foil for Shaun. The fact that zombies are taking over London slowly sinks in,and isn't helped by the fact that(and this bit I have no doubt was the filmmakers tongue-in-cheek jab at London/British urban lifestyle)many locals are already lethargic,slow-moving,inarticulate sorts. There is much confusion over who is undead and who is merely drunk in this film,and there are some great visual similarities between the undead and Shaun himself. By the time it is eminently clear that London,perhaps all of England and maybe even the world,is being overtaken by the walking dead,it becomes a full-on race and struggle for survival. Par for the course there,the signature of any ordinary film of this genre. But the way the principal characters react to the situation and each other is both very palpable,aggravating(it doesn't dawn on them until about 2/3 of the way through the film that they should SHOOT THE ZOMBIES IN THE HEAD?)and funny. The ending may seem a bit of a cop-out for some,but it fits the rhythm of the movie as it was set up.Horror-comedies are rare(and I'm ready to give a rhetorical beat-down to the next person who thinks the 'Scream' movies are parodies. The 'Scary Movie' films ARE.)and probably somewhat difficult to make. I suppose 'Love at First Bite' or 'American Werewolf in London' might be considered examples. But this film is able to balance the scares,gore and other conventions of thriller flicks with - daffy,pratfall comedy,and that makes this film very special. The amount of pop music references and usage(Queen in particular)is something that sealed the deal for me. I probably would've voted a 9.5 for this one,since I don't really fancy myself a horror movie aficionado,but since you cannot vote like that on IMDb,so I rounded up.",10,0,1,1 March 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Predictably entertaining or entertainingly predictable?
","The follow-up to 2003's smash hit Pirates of the Caribbean:Curse of the Black Pearl was highly inevitable,and so here it is! Most of the old gang is back here,particularly the principals. The high-bred-but-wild-child-at-heart Elizabeth Swann(Keira Knightley,as willowy and yet athletic as ever)finds her wedding date with the valiant Will Turner(Orlando Bloom,willow-er...attractive and athletic as ever)interrupted by an arrest warrant being served her and him,in regards to their complicity in letting one Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp,skanked up,dandied and devilish as ever)escape the Royal Navy's authority. It seems that the only way the two can escape the gallows for this high crime against Queen and country is to make a deal with the magistrate(Tom Hollander),which has them destined to twine ways with the nefarious Captain,who's got his own agenda to attend to. It seems he's managed to draw the ire of none other than fearsome Pirate legend and demonic troll Davy Jones(Bill Nighy in heavy,heavy makeup and rubber),who has a very dear price he wants the Captain to pay. This while Jack himself seeks something of the Captain's:namely,the legendary Dead MAn's Chest,which beats the heart of old Jones.The movie has exactly what you'd expect of it,particularly if you saw the first film: sword fights,rocking,jarring physical effects,quick banter,a few plot twists and a few touches of the supernatural. Only this time,the physical comedy,which was a side compliment to last films good-natured sense of adventure,now takes front seat as the adventure becomes the under-pinning of this at-sea endeavor. This movie is every bit the summer entertainment that it is meant to be. Indeed,I'm not sure what more I--or anyone,for that matter--could really expect of it. It moves at a great pace and only starts to feel like it's running a little long toward the very end. The costuming,make-up and scenery is great escapist fun,and the performances by Depp(to the point that it feels like tedium to even mention),Nighy,Mackenzie Cook and Lee Arenberg(as the comic relief)and Knightley make this movie seem authentic enough that you can taste the rum. It may not be the best movie you'll see this year or this summer,I dare you to find one that sets up just a great look,feel and sound that comes anywhere close to living up to its potential the way this film,the second directed by the eclectic Gore Verbinski,does.",9,1,3,29 July 2006
Stripes," FALL Iiiin!!!
","Working class schleps John Winger(Bill Murray)and Russell Ziskey(Harold Ramis)decide,on a whim,to join the Army,much of the reasoning to escape the humdrum lives they lead in the big city. Probably not the best reasoning,but if we had good reasoning added to the mix of many comedies,they'd seem to cease being comedies now,wouldn't they?Thus we have the seedlings of this largely enjoyable comedy that mixes many of the ingredients of National Lampoon's Animal House and Meatballs(which were directed and/or written by director Ivan Reitman and Ramis),which follows the two protagonists thru basic training on through their first deployment in Europe. And if you're guessing that there's more to the story than merely passing basic training and their deployment well,you'd be guessing correctly.A friend of mine who's been in the Army(around the time this movie was released,in fact)told me that the film isn't based in much reality--and I'm sure most people who been in the Army would probably agree--but I have the impression that this has JUST enough real element in it to make it roundly palpable AS WELL as a lot of fun.A fantastic ensemble cast features Warren Oates in one of his last roles(as their drill Sergeant),John Larroquette(as a preening,weaselly superior),John Candy(as the gregarious,heavy-set recruit with JUST the right amount of rage issues),John Dietz,P.J.Soles(a sympathetic MP who has a thing for Murray's character),Sean Young(same as SOles' character,only for Ramis),Conrad Dunn and John Volstead(pre-'Other brother Darryl' from Newhart,as Laroquette's oft-put-upon aide)among others to fill out as big,loud and enthusiastic ensemble. Three years later,Reitman,Murray and Ramis(to name possibly just a few)would tone this formula down to 'PG' for the even more successful comedy Ghostbusters. Here,they keep it loose,kinetic and light as a quasi-Cold War,broadly patriotic usage of about 100 minutes of film viewing.A great watch no matter the medium(big screen,TV,video,DVD). The more recent DVDs have plenty of back-chatter,tributes and story about the making. Well,well worth the price if you're up for it,as well as this show.",9,0,0,20 September 2010
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Movie:9.5,Music:10!
","This film gets better with each viewing. The jokes are tasteless,the religious cosmology will bother more than a few people(I suppose I could say that applies to me somewhat),the fans of Bryan Adams,Brooke Shields and the Baldwin brothers can sit this one out. Still,this has to be one of the most creative and fun movie musicals that have been concocted in years! South Park/Baseketball/PArker&Stone fans will probably appreciate this more than the average viewers. But I figure that even casual South PArk fans will get a kick out of this show.The plot is centered on the four boys,Stan,Kyle,Kenny and Cartman,go see the R-rated movie of their favorite Canadian entertainers,Terrence and Phillip. After sitting through the film,they come home with potty mouths(or even pottier than before),this shocks and horrifies their parents and Kyle's mom Sheila decides to take ultimate action in assessing blame on why the town's kids now have bad mouths,dirty minds and nasty attitudes. Thus setting in motion a series of events--and before I forget,Kenny is killed because he tries a stunt from the movie,at Cartman's egging--that sends the U.S.A. to war with Canada. Meanwhile,Kenny returns from Hell with news that Satan and his lover,Saddam Hussein are planing a takeover of Eart that is a direct correlation of the war and the fate of Terrence and Phillip.If that summary hasn't basically disgusted or confused you,then congratulations! You are probably right to watch this film. My personal opinion is that the music from this film(co-written by PArker and musical guru MArc Shaiman)is even better than the film itself and is worth purchasing,although I suppose if you haven't seen the film and/or South PArk the television series,it will be lost on you. My advice,see the movie and if it turns you on,I suggest you buy the soundtrack!",9,0,1,10 May 2005
Balls of Fury," It knows you think it's dumb;it doesn't care
","PIng-pong prodigy RAndy Daytona(Dan Fogler,as unlikely a leading man as they come!)has grown up under the failed ambitions of his youth to be a has-been,sideshow act when he is contacted by the Feds(led by a grimacing George Lopez)to infiltrate the racket of the mysterious Master Feng(Christopher Walken,far-and-away the best part of the movie).He'll need the help of the blind MAster Wong(JAmes HOng,having fun in a role written exclusively for him it appears)And his niece(MAggie Q,lean and mean!). Of course,there's added incentive for the one-time Olympic contestant turned wash-out:his hard-gambling father was one of the many victims of the nefarious Feng.It is Oh-so-tempting to give this film a higher rating for me,because I found this film genuinely funny and also wise enough to understand just HOW clichéd and unoriginal the film's plot devices are(a quick list: aforementioned washout re-finding his game,wise old sage teacher,the tough-as-nails female lead/potential love-interest for male lead,high-stakes tournament),hence my summary line. Director Robert Ben Garant and co-writer(who also plays arch-baddie competitor and Cold war German stereotype Karl Wolfstaadt)Tom Lennon create a crass but effective comedy. I guess why I can't give this anything better than the rating I gave it simply because it seems like this movie skimps on the whole plot,choosing to instead put more emphasis on the gags. THat's good for the film in a microcosmic sort of way(i.e.the laughs)but it doesn't distinguish itself from other,similar-themed movies(Kingpin,Blades of Glory come immediately to mind). Still,as a rent,this is a basically likable way to waste about 90 minutes to two hours of your weekend or holidays.",6,4,6,30 December 2007
"I Love You, Man"," A fresh breath of air to the relationship movie
","We all know that Hollywood seems to have the originality of a spastic Xerox machine;in other words,find a successful formula and there'll be about eighteen different takes or copies of it lying in wait. Never does the dearth of originality seem to raise its big old ugly head than in relationship movies,sometimes called romantic comedies or 'rom coms'. Even when different angles seem to be explored,they still come to the same,tired wrap-up that involve the cute major players,boy and girl,to find love in each others' arms despite the obstacles. Every once in a while,I'm relieved to say,you do run across a film that decides to mine the margins of these love stories to make a movie.I submit to you I Love You Man,made with the sensibility--and at least two members of the stable of actors--of a Judd Apatow/Greg Mottola film,and VERY appreciated.Peter Klaven(Paul Rudd,the nicest,most likable mensch in movies and TV today,with a punum you could just....)is a reasonably successful Real Estate agent in Southern California whose engagement to Zoe(Rashida Jones,the girlfriend from Heaven)couldn't be going better. They're very much in love and she gets his silly,sometimes lame persona and he appreciates her patience and physical receptiveness. Everything's going well for their impending connubial bliss,save one thing:Peter has no guy friends. None. While Ol' Pete has a great touch with the ladies,he has almost no bro bonding to fall back on.This previous situation,once not considered a problem if even considered at all now weighs upon our hero,and he gets help(both solicited and not)from family--Mom(Jane Curtin)and bro(Andy Samberg)--and from fiancé herself. The phrase 'hilarity ensues' is overused but,in these instances,they apply.Then walks into an open house Sidney Fife(Jason Segel,physically the same from Forgetting Sarah Marshall,but character-wise a near one-eighty),an investment broker whose own,self-actualized sense of zen and bro-supreme self-sufficiency hits it off perfectly with Peter,balancing the groom-to-be's pleasant but feminine recessive qualities.Featuring a supporting cast that doesn't try to stand out but still does: Curtin,Samber,J.K.Simmons(as Peter's dad),Tom Lennon(as a potential guy friend 'suitor'),Sarah Burns(as one of Zoe's more pathetic friends),Jaime Pressly(as Zoe's perpetually angry married friend),Jon Favreau(as Pressly's dickish husband)and Lou Ferrigno(as...well,Lou Ferrigno),this film has a delightful time bringing to screen a 'love' story angle that is as fresh,real and relatively ignored in most movies starring(pick any two of the following):Matthew McConaughey,Kate Hudson,Sandra Bullock,Meg Ryan,Hugh Grant,Ryan Reynolds,Renee Zellweger,Richard Gere or Reese Witherspoon. Co-writer John Hamburg directs this film,and he seems to be perfectly fine with letting this film amble along to its conclusion,scattering more than its share of laughs and pratfalls along the way. If this isn't love I felt for this fine film,it certainly with a fine affinity,nay a mild infatuation,I felt here...man(you HAD to know THAT was coming).",9,38,67,29 May 2009
Superbad," An Epic tale of a quest for booze and sex
","According to co-writer and co-producer(who gets to be a part of his own flick as Officer Michaels)Seth Rogen,the script for 'Superbad' was a collaboration that had been worked on and ironed out over a decade ago(which,if Rogen's bio is correct,means he and his pal Evan Goldberg started working on the screenplay of a movie about high schoolers when they were still in JUNIOR HIGH school)and producing it into a film was something they had long strove for. If so,I believe the payoff will be to their liking.Lifelong buddies Seth(Jonah Hill,a familiar tag-along of Rogen's,going back to 'Freaks and Geeks' and most recently in the also hilarious 'Knocked Up')and Even(Michael Cena,a part of one of my all-time faves 'Arrested Development') are facing the end of high school and the very grim possibility that they will enter into the adult world as virgins. Being relatively normal boys,they think of almost exclusively girls,movies and music(and almost in disproportionate and descending order). To make matters worse,while Even has managed to get into DArtmouth while Seth has opted to try 'Local' college,so their partnership seems to be about to be dissolved. To this end,they seek to lose their virginities with their respective girls:Seth's is Jules and Evan is Becca. They reason,to that goal,that if they can get their intendeds sloppy drunk at one of the major 'Senior parties' being thrown,they will achieve this goal. Enter Fogell(Christopher Mintz-Plasse,a natural!),a whispery slight lad they hang with,who possesses some of the same delusions as Seth and Evan(and has a few of his own),who becomes their confederate in this mission. He becomes the point-man in their endeavor,and his owning of a fake ID from HAwaii that identifies as merely 'McLovin' becomes both a comedic gem and a trigger point for the action that ensues from there.The story takes place over the course of a little over twenty-four hours,and while actual events that take place(i.e.an armed robbery,cops who flout their authority and lack a fair amount of maturity themselves,getting physically hit by automobiles,taking a ride with an unstable stranger,potential date rape)in this story should not illicit laughs in normal conditions,they are handled with the right amount of delicacy and absurdity to make it clearly funny(albeit somewhat uncomfortable)in this film. Rogen and SNL member Bill Hader(as Officer Slater)are the perfect foils/accomplices as the morally challenged cops,and the girls the boys pair up with(the only name that sticks in my mind is Aviva as Fogell's lust target)are not easily pigeon-holed,which makes them dynamic characters to match the vibrant uncertainty of their suitors. Director Greg Mottola either is on the same wavelength as the writers and actors or has decided to quietly guide this project,but it works smoothly all the same. To me,this film was strictly OK in the first thirty to forty-five minutes but picks up energy as the action increases(namely,at the point where the liquor purchase occurs through to the next day). Some great lines and a general ability to tie together rude,crude and lewd obsession with a gentle sense of missing one's naiveté and youth. I feel like adults who remember their teen years(rather than kids still in or not far removed from their high school years,who will probably like this movie for the more obvious reasons) will in all likelihood TRULY appreciate this movie,since there's a real sense of dumb nostalgia that is celebrated here. To this thought,I'm in some disbelief of the fact that two pre-high school guys could've written this movie(or at least not in the finished form that we see),but then again,this might've been an evolving opus. Irregardless,while I feel like this film is more of about an 8.5,but I decided to round up,since there's so much energy and likability with the principals that you can't help but give this one a bump. While going for liquor and/or sex may not SEEM to be an epic adventure,anyone who can remember when it was so(or can appreciate it in the present)will love this movie.",9,1,6,30 August 2007
That Thing You Do!," A Nice story of the dreams of a 'one-hit wonder' group,in Beatles-era America
","The humble beginnings,meteoric rise and equally quick descent of a band of average,perceivably clean-cut kids from semi-rural Pennsylvania is the entire premise behind this movie,which boasts the movie directorial debut of Tom HAnks(his only film directorial job to date). While I cannot claim this a wonderful,masterful film,it was certainly good enough for me to give it multiple viewings.The central hero is Guy Paterson(Tom Everett Scott,congenial and average and thus perfect for the role),a JAzz-loving drummer who works in his dad's appliance store. HE is the central architect of the band 'THe ONe-ders'(And there's plenty of pronunciation goofs awaiting that!),which latch onto the burgeoning rock scene with a few popular tracks that get local airplay. When the band,consisting of guitarists Lenny(Steve ZAhn,never out of a job),T.B.(Ethan Embry)and lead singer Jimmy(JOnathan Schaech) get spotted by an enigmatic-yet-paternal music representative named White(HAnks,at full ease),their star progressively rises to the point where their demand goes national and their egos grow in separate ways. IN the mix are the lead singer's sensitive and naive girlfriend(Liv Tyler)and the spoiled Barbie-doll hanger-on(CHarlize Theron,who almost slips through the cracks of this film).Of course,the lead singer being an egotistical ass and Guy being a sensitive,recessive fellow,the budding romance is as predictable as the weather. HAnks' sympathy for the era as screenwriter and director,goes a long way to making this easy to watch. Ditto the casting of then mostly unknown younger actors to fill out the major roles. There is the perfect balance of bright,wide-eyed optimism of youngster wanting to be the next big thing in rock 'n roll and the reality of the business that makes this film neither sugary or cynical. I could nitpick as to elements that made this movie imperfect,but I'd just as soon not,since this movie has such a friendly,unique quality that I'd feel remiss in picking on it. While you need not be either an aficionado of 1960s rock and/or be from that era,it certainly wouldn't hurt in order to enjoy this movie. Or at the very least,this should appeal to the sentimentalist in anyone.",8,0,0,5 November 2007
Constantine," Well,I can't say it's ALL Keanu's fault
","This movie adaptation of the popular comic book of the same name is just entertaining enough to not be a complete drudge,but it's hardly perfect.Anti-hero,demon-expelling private detective John Constantine(Keanu Reeves,curious casting by those who've read the comic book,as well as to the legions of people who do not regard his acting abilities very highly)is contacted by a distressed police detective(RAchel Weisz,who is as compelling as she is lovely MHO)whose twin sister seems to have killed herself. She believes that her sister's death was not a suicide,because if it were,per Catholic tradition(actually,I believe it's fairly common of a belief in ALL major,mono-theistic religions),then her sister would go to Hell, since suicide is considered a mortal sin.PLenty of cool imagery and a harsh music and sound effects track both add character and ambiance to this film. The stories are interesting. So what went wrong? It would be tempting to lump this all on the square shoulders of Mr.Reeves,and while he is not particularly stellar here,I don't feel that he quite ruined this either,because his brooding lack of verbosity may actually BE what a character like Constantine needed.To be sure,Keanu DOES seem to lack the gravitas or wit that a hard-bitten,seemingly doomed cynic who just happens to be doing God's work should have. But I also think that really,outside of Weisz,Peter Stormare(as a leering Satan)and Tilda Swinton(as the gender-neutral Archangel GAbriel),the acting here is pretty spare and strangely almost incongruent with the way this film is paced. It almost feels like this would've worked better on the big screen if it were animated INSTEAD of live-action. Also,the script seems to be just filler between supernatural confrontations,bridges to the end of the story rather than telling anything particularly interesting about any of the players involved,save maybe Constantine himself. There was an interesting story here,and plenty of eye-candy,but it seems to lack much life. I can honestly say I'm happier I rented this than went to the cineamaplex,though I think I could've waited for this go to cable and would've been no less disappointed or more pleased.",5,0,3,13 December 2005
Brokeback Mountain," A painful love story,period.
","BY now,a lot has been written and said about this film. Having seen it somewhat recently and very attuned to the post-Oscar reaction since. I feel like weighing in just a little more.This story of two herdsmen(Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal,perfectly affecting) who discover first an attraction,then love while herding sheep in the mountains of Wyoming over one summer,then proceed to carry out a relationship that stretches nearly two decades,has garnered a lot more controversy than really seems necessary. This movie is,pure and simple,a love story,played out with great difficulty and filmed very beautifully. Some very affecting supporting performances by Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway(going different directions:Williams as the hurting and deeply personalized wife of Ledger's Ennis,Hathaway as a flinty,single-minded and stubborn wife of Gyllenhaal's JAck) flesh out this film. Add on colorfully smart cinematography by Rodrigo Prietro and music score by Gustavo Santoaallalla(Sp?) and you have a very memorable film. Director Ang Lee can make you almost completely forget he directed The Hulk from this work(Heck,you might even not make the connection to seemingly non-related works as The Ice Storm or Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon!),which to me would be a basically good thing.I've made my opinion as to the significance(or even lack of significance)that this film carries in regards to gays in film. Those who either want to laud this movie as groundbreaking(slight majority)to those who want to condemn it as promoting the gay agenda/lifestyle(a BIG misguided minority) can prattle on all they want. To me,this film is a scenic love story well made. Nothing more,nothing less.",9,18,20,23 March 2006
Juno," A good movie with super performances
","I went into this film feeling like I would almost HAVE to like this,since the buzz was nothing but good(save the scads of less-than-flattering posts on the JUno IMDb message board). I came away from the film genuinely impressed with the make-up of the film,even if the overall end product maybe left some things to be desired.Whether you regard Minnesota teen Juno Maguff(Ellen Page,fast-walking and fast-talking through this gem role)as a typical teen might say as much about how you define the term 'typical': a sardonic,artsy,semi-lonerish girl who is never shy to share her opinions about anything,her fateful encounter with the boy she loves(Michael Cera,who was probably better in 'Superbad' and TV's 'Arrested Development')gets her pregnant and,after initially wanting nothing to do with the pregnancy,decides almost impulsively to keep the baby,at least until she can find adoptive parents. Her search isn't particularly long as she stumbles upon an ad in the penny-saver for an attractive couple(JAson BAteman and Jennifer GArner,probably following each other from the set of 'The KIngdom' to do this)who seem to be more than willing to adopt.FAntastic performances by PAge,BAteman,GArner and J.K.Simmons(one of the more taken for granted actors in the biz)as Juno's equally sardonic but loving DAd are complimented by adequate,fine performances--if perhaps not exceptional--from Allison Janney(As JUno's step-mom),Olivia Thrilby(as her best friend)and Cera. Director Jason Reitman throws the curve by helming this(his previous flick was the scathing,sharp,slick 'Thank You For Smoking')project,off a script by exotic dancer Diablo Cody. Both Reitman and Cody make a humane and funny(if perhaps over-written and too 'quirky' by half)film,and the performances make the difference.While I cannot,truly gush over this movie as many have(among other reasons:the super-quick,quirky,too-cool-for-school dialog and the sometimes annoying music scoring by Indy band Moldy Peaches),I am still impressed enough by the pacing,humor and general intelligence of the story to recommend it. Not the best movie of '07 maybe,but you could do much worse with your money.",8,5,17,15 January 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," Why did people take this film as seriously as they did?
","This film got a lot of (in my humble opinion)unwarranted attention for its environmentalist message, both good and bad, and of course,I wondered:why? Even before seeing this film(OK,I read a few reviews,so I was already for what I was to see) I knew that this was,message aside,little more than a big-budget special effects blockbuster. After seeing it,my suspicions were confirmed. My politics would probably favor the general message of the movie,but I still found it hard to believe that groups like MoveOn.org were trying to do the hard-sell for this picture. For starters,the way the climate changes are portrayed in this film are so rapid and,at times,ridiculous that it siphons away much of the legitimacy of the 'Global Warming as a legitimate threat' menace,which would seem to do more harm than good to the 'Save the Environment' movement. The visual effects ARE impressive,but they are given such force and vibrancy that they become the stars of the show,rather than the message or (get this!)the actors involved.On that topic,really there is nothing at all distinctive of interesting about nearly all the characters involved. In particular,Dennis Quaid,JAke Gyllenhaal,Emmy Rossum,Sela Ward(overrated TV actress,also MHO),Jay O. Sanders among others seem to be mere readers to their script lines,truly wasting their talents. A subplot about a group of meteorologists in Scotland,led by Ian Holm,was,to me,more interesting and sympathetic but,naturally,this being an American film(directed by the Kaboom-obsessed German director Roland Emmerich),they will get easily left behind in favor of the pluckier American heroes. Being a Yank myself,I wouldn't mind this if I thought the characters from my country weren't as flat as the paper they were written on. IN short,I would recommend this film to watch more as a sort of topic-related adventure flick, rather than a stirring 'call to arms' type picture,and that's if I were to recommend it at all. The White HOuse being alarmed by this film's message was unnecessary. If this film stirs you or someone to become more environmentally conscious,well...God bless ya,but I think you'd be in the minority of its viewers. A summer movie,pure and simple,and not a terribly good one at that.",5,0,2,20 June 2005
Spider-Man 3," Another poster said it first,but it's too true
","Someone else wrote about this movie that it was(and I'm paraphrasing BIG time here,but bear with me)adequate,entertaining enough but far from the best of the Spidey films. I wish I could add something better,but I feel like that sums this up.Now popular and practically the alpha-male,king of the city,Spidey sails about the city practically posing for photos,signing autographs and (last but not least)saving people and thwarting crimes. Peter PArker(Tobey Maguire,still trippy,bug-eyed and youthey. Ahh,some things never change!)can't complain,either:he's the star photog for the newspaper and his love life with longtime flame Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst,as creamy-skinned and sweet as before)couldn't be better. That's all about to change as a mysterious glob of protoplasm invades his life,turns him into a darker,edgier character with stronger,meaner urges and instincts,virtually alienating everyone he knows and making him a much less personable and friendly neighborhood hero. As this is all happening,an escaped con(Thomas HAden Church)somehow ends up being transformed into a nearly impervious super-villain called SAndman,and his connection to Peter will eventually have him coming to a dangerous head. All this,while a weaselly,ambitious rival photog(Topher Grace,probably doing the most dynamic acting here)finds himself at the point of trying to destroy Parker by any means possible.Director Sam RAimi has this on auto-pilot,and the result is something that has the visual and overall quality of the film to pretty much match the previous two offerings,but overlong,over-loaded with villains and plot contrivances(a possible romantic device involving Bryce Dallas Howard as the bubbly, vivacious police CAptain's daughter seemed a bit much,and James Franco's return as Harry seemed to be somehow squeezed out in the plot,which is wrong),this movie pretty much unhinges the energy and campy fun of the previous two movies. At this point,I'm not sure how(if at all)the Spiderman franchise is going to carry on. I have no doubt it will,but it will be interesting to see if the principal players(THe RAimis--Sam and co-writer Ivan--,Maguire,Dunst,Rosemary Harris as durable Aunt MAy,the awesome J.K. Simmons as JAmeson,Bruce Campbell,etc.)will want to continue this series,and how it will look. For now,anyway,I guess one has to enjoy this movie as a part of the totality of the trilogy,and resign themselves to this movie being somewhat of a letdown. A sometimes breathtaking,energetic and visually stimulating letdown,to be sure,but a letdown all the same.",7,0,1,1 December 2007
Zodiac," A Serial-killer movie with no easy answers. Imagine that!
","Re-watching this movie,I was moved to write a review. I'm not sure why I didn't the first time that I saw this,but maybe I was in such awe and disbelief of the product on the first viewing that I felt like I needed a RE-viewing to take it all in again. I'm glad I did.Director David Fincher('Se7en','Fight Club','Panic Room',all VERY good movies IMO)may not seem to be the best choice to helm this true-story accounting of the Zodiac killings,set around the San Francisco Bay Area in the late,late 1960s and early early 1970s,but Fincher's ever-sharp eye for moody,eerie detail is perfect here! Based on the 1981 BEst-seller by SF Chroncile CArtoonist Robert Graysmith(off a script penned by James Vanderbilt),the story picks up off of the SECOND pair of murders that occurred,this time during fourth of JUly weekend 1969 and follows with great attention to detail both the police investigation of the crimes and the press' involvement in coverage,particularly the offices of the San Francicsco Examiner. The central characters sort out to be the Examiner's Crime reporter Paul Avery(Robert Downey Jr.,possessing arguably some of the best lines in the movie),SFPD inspectors David Toschi(Mark Ruffalo,hard-working and sympathetic as ever)and Bill Armstrong(Anthony Edwards,who should be working more) and,of course,Graysmith(JAke Gyllenhaal,perfecting the 'likable social retard' role he's probably better known for),who proves to have a very sharp eye for solving codes,puzzles,riddles and ciphers. Over the progression of almost two-and-a-half hours of movie time,the investigation shifts focus and the details,minutiae and personalities begin to accumulate,both creating pieces to slowly(try roughly twenty-two years in sum)fit the puzzle,yet always leaving some doubts as to who,how(also how many),why and--in the beginning--when,as the eponymous killer goes from being a taunting sociopath to a desperate attention-grabber. Naturally,as the process becomes bogged in details and due process,the investigation grows colder,where it births as a media sensation as well as a police problem,until it ends up being part of a low-profile,single agenda obsession for the cartoonist Graysmith. By the end of the movie,the facts presented--and I choose to be INTENTIONALLY vague here--make this as potentially frustrating for the viewer as it was for those,police and otherwise who tried to solve it.Editing,lighting(EXCELLENT use of color schemes to show the sort of dingy,kitchy look of the early seventies),score(by David Shire),pacing,as well as fine performances by the principles(and some lower-billed roles too,notably Chloe Sevigny as Graysmith's patience-exhausted girlfriend/wife,Dermont Mulroney as Toschi and Armstrong's superior,John Carroll Lynch as the chief suspect and Charles Fleischer as a potential 'person of interest')make this movie one of the more quiet gems to pas through theaters in 2007. If I understand correctly--and I haven't COMPLETELY pored over the Oscar noms yet--this show didn't get ANY nods,which is a true head-scratcher. In the movies,just about all serial killer flicks have some sort of visceral release or denouement(heck,'Dirty HArry'for which was mostly inspired BY the actual Zodiac case,practically is made as a surrogate for the real-life case,and does just that--provides the closure!),but leave it to a detail-driven film based on a real baffler to provide something unique and well-worth the film-viewer's time and money.",10,1,4,6 February 2008
Milk," Cannot speak to 'social significance,relevance,etc.';can only speak to the movie itself
","I've sampled some of the other comments and this is another film that seems to inspire extreme opinions. While it seems to have plenty of more positive opinion,there are(naturally)going to be some WAY less than positive reviews,much of them,it seems,steeped in an adverse opinion about gays,Sean Penn,Hollywood and the media at large. I thought I'd address that because it seems like it would be rather dense and oblivious of me to ignore it.Also,I know that there is plenty to this movie that would inspire any person who just saw it to become overwhelmed by this sense of almost social,political,even spiritual revelation and inspiration,a sort of sense of benediction toward a hero or revolutionary. Since I'm not gay and my memories of HArvey Milk,Prop 8,Anita Bryant or any element of the 1970s Gay rights movements is pretty sketchy at best,I'm afraid the social significance for me personally is mostly marginal.So I,the reviewer,am basically left at examining this movie for exactly what it is: a big-budget,bio-pic during award season. As such,it largely works.The story of activist and charismatic politico HArvey Milk(Sean Penn,much less 'ACTING!' as he is sometimes want to do)picks up as he's a freshly forty gay man leaving behind his closeted life in New Yorck City with younger lover Scott Smith(JAmes Franco,really growing as an actor!) to re-build in the economically flipped,new gay haven that was early 1970s San Francisco. First as a business man in the CAstro district,then as a charismatic,socially winsome politician-wanna-be and self-appointed 'Mayor of CAstro',Milk becomes steadily more and more energized as a type of activist. As his popularity grows,so does his controversy,and when he's finally elected to city counsel in 1977,he quietly knows he's a marked man,yet he's still compelled to act on his convictions.The supporting cast is good,if not magnificent. Best turns seem to come from Emile Hirsch as an ambitious,'never knew he could be so passionate'gay youth and future activist Cleve Jones,Diego Luna as Milk's boyfriend during his election years,a hyper-depressed fem who threatens Milk's image constantly and Josh Brolin as DAn White,the straight-arrow rival counsel-man who's own personal conflicts regarding Milk(among other things) will create a combustive and fateful result. OPenly gay director Gus Van Sant applies much of what he's known for:jump-cuts,narrative framing and lean,mean story-telling to frame what was journalist RAndy Shilts' facts(hemmed into a script by someone whose name right now escapes me)into a largely effective story. THe movie itself mostly suffers from some fairly common elements in bio-pictures(i.e. predictable arcs,foreshadowing that is as plain as day);not bad things,really,but stuff that has little distinction over what you might easily as soon catch in documentaries or even made-for-TV movies. It also is unabashedly carrying a sense of 'agenda';not a Liberal/Conservative type of agenda,or even a personal experience agenda,but more of a 'Great,flawed man + purity of conviction = sainthood'. Again,not terrible things in and of themselves,but they constrict the viewing of this film to something of an either a 'Soapbox' effect or a educational effect,which can just as easily alienate as enlighten. MAybe Van Sant figured those things to be the end product,but when a show becomes as critically acclaimed as MIlk has become,it muddies the waters and forces viewers who may not have a particularly clear opinion on the issues being broached to either accept or reject his movie,rather than absorb this as a real and commendable human issue struggle story.Fantastic performances,solid soundtrack and a competent(if perhaps overly cut-and-dried)film make for not only award nominees but also fine entertainment. On that count,Milk largely succeeds.",8,0,3,9 February 2009
The Prestige," Raising the stakes in this tale of illusions and revenge
","Director Christopher Nolan has gone from quirky,disturbing mystery director(Following,Memento)to mind f--er(Insomnia) to dark action movie director(Batman Begins)and with the Presitge,back to mind f--er.One-time friends,cohorts and now rival magicians in Victorian England,Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman,who seems to be in everything lately)and Alfred Borden(Christian Bale,returning to his native accent)engage in a war of out-doing each other and,possibly,doing harm to each other as they try to outwit and out-perform each other,both looking to perfect and improve upon the art of creating the perfect illusion. The fuel for their rivalry isn't entirely in their heads:Borden's inexplicable inability to save Angier's wife(Piper Perabo)from a botched escape routine has set Angier out to make his act not just an act but a personal vendetta to destroy Borden,and Angier's ruining of Borden's first public performance(along with part of Borden's right hand),steels Borden to sabotage and monitor his old chum's performances.Years later,when it appears that Borden has found a way to near-flawlessly perform the 'Transported Man' routine,Angier goes to great lengths--specifically,the mountains of Colorado--to look up charismatic and mysterious inventor Nikola Tesla(a saturnine,mesmerizing and brunette David Bowie)to help with a contraption that will enhance the act. The contraption proves to be a much more powerful device,one that threatens to destroy whomever uses it. Or does it?The neat thing,to me,about magic/con movies is that they always challenge the viewer to keep up with it. They may not always succeed,but they at least try to keep the viewer from being passive. Such is the case with this film,which is visually enchanting and acted nicely. The leads,in particular,are studied and focused as increasingly bitter rivals. Michael Caine is fantastic as their mentor,a sage and patient man who senses that he has little power over what's about to happen and merely wants to stay out of the way. The lovely Scarlett Johnnson makes the most out of her late addition character,an attractive magician's assistant who is brought up by Angier but finds herself smitten with Borden.Mood and atmosphere are important here,and this film makes the most of it. It may not be perfect,and it did seem like it left a few too many plot lines to dangle,but overall,it was effective,and that's what should count. As one of the lines in the movie exhorts you the viewer to do:watch closely.",9,1,1,17 November 2006
The Terminator," Picture anyone else as the titular HK. Just try it.
","CAn't do it,can you? That's how indelible Arnold Schwazenegger is as the title character,a perfectly made HK(Hunter KIller)android who has been sent from the future to eliminate the would-be mother of humanity's fiercest rebel and last true hope. Fortunately for the heroine of this show,SArah Connor(LInda Hamilton,before she beefed into the tough-chick she'd be type cast as AFTER T2,and probably best remembered as a similar,somewhat weaker type character in previous films like TAG and Children of the Corn),said machine has had to waste his way through Los Angeles to find her,so this buys her some time while one Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn,whose career has never completely up-turned since Aliens)also from the future,goes in pursuit of the 'droid AND protect Sarah,thus ensuring the birth of humanity's hero,one John Connor,and protecting humankind's future. As the droid draws nearer and nearer to Sarah and Kyle,and the body count rises,an adrenaline-pumping,gut-wrenching battle between Man's last best hope and a killing machine who'has no pity,no conscience,cannot be bargained with and will not stop until it finds and terminates its target(I'm paraphrasing here somewhat)' chugs toward fruition.I learned not too long ago that director and co-writer James Cameron had NOT planned a sequel(let alone a trilogy or series)of this film and intended it to be a singular ending. Looking back at it as a whole product,it makes more sense(and that's all I'm saying from there so as to avoid any spoilers for those out there who HAVEN'T seen this film or aren't at least familiar with it). I can both understand why this film was only a marginal success when it was first released in late Fall/early Winter 1984: much of the cast were somewhat unknowns at the time,save Paul Warfield(As a doubting yet humane cop) and,of course,bodybuilding champ Schwarzenegger,and the concepts and images of the film were pure Sci-Fi,which always seems to be a bit of a hard sell to the general public. But much like another movie released around the same time,A Nightmare on Elm Street,it was a fairly unique and inexorably memorable movie that was bound to not only have sequels made but practically change the face of the genres they were made in. It's sequels are both well made(and I actually appreciated the whole size and scope of it's 1991 sequel,T2;Judgement Day somewhat better,the best of all three),and I intend to catch the next in the series,should it be made. Since Arnold vowed he was not doing any more movies as long as he's in public office,that could be a while. Still,it took almost twenty years to continue the simple storyline of man's battle with machines who've become far too powerful over just THREE movies,so what's another twenty years? It very well may be back.",9,2,3,12 January 2007
Cloverfield," The Monster movie,from the margins
","Having read through a sampling of some of the other comments on this site,I gotta say that I'm very struck by the fact that this film doesn't inspire much 'in-betwens': a fair share of either 8s,9s or 10s or else 2s or 1s on the star rating,and more than a couple of angry,sardonic dismissals paired in with a few positive 'I get it' type reviews.I suppose,having to chose between the negative and positive reviews,I'd be counted on the latter,though barely.At this point,I don't think I'm telling any secrets or revealing anything that isn't already known about this film:producer J.J. Abrams,director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard have constructed a spare,seemingly low-budget concept movie. That this is a creature movie--and what a creature it is,replete with nearly impregnable skin and spouting offspring that's much smaller but nasty and plentiful--seems to be somewhat of a subject experiment. In other words,this is a monster movie,but the monster seems to be of less direct interest than the viewpoint and survival of some of the New Yorkers who are enduring it,in this instance the five-some of friends/family who are coming from a going away party for one of them in mid-town Manhattan. While the five actors Michael David-Stahl,Jessica Lucas,Lizzy Caplan,T.J. Miller and Mike Vogel(searching for a sixth,played by Odette Yustman)seem to show some sparks of interest,humor or emotional depth,their characters have almost no depth and hence,no real reason to care about them. It isn't until the more intimate,scary and tangential moments of the later film does it seem that there's much reason to have any interest into their fates,and by then,it feels like too little and too late.The best part of this film is by far the concept and,in a grudging sense,the execution of it. The hand-held effect of filming a movie,particularly in a horror/sci-fi sense,is something of an work in audience endurance. Since there is a premium on audience fear,confusion and apprehension in any scary film,the objective of the filmmaker is to make that fear roundly and emotionally real. If one can stomach(Literally and figuratively)the bouncy,disjointed and shaky filming process--which seems fairly credible given the circumstances--then the movie's creators have done a fantastic that said viewer will be impressed. Promotion of this film,as mentioned by others,also is the grand mark or opus of this creation,being able to achieve a sense of audience interest and curiosity WELL before its release,an accomplishment that puts it up there with such cult films(which became equally famous for the public interest burnout that followed the initial swell of turnout)as 'Blair Witch Project' and 'Snakes on a PLane'.Overall,I'd say this movie is certainly worth a look,though I wouldn't give any grand superlatives for how brilliant or great it is. It's effective,'BOO!'-type sci-fi/action/horror,that revels more in the concept and image than the volume of the product. NO more,no less.",6,14,28,25 May 2008
Crash," Absolutely NOT unworthy of best picture
","In the backlash over it's 'surprising' win for Best Picture at the Oscars(it seemed to have the best chance of winning over Brokeback,if I recall the pre-Oscar buzz correctly),it seems like everyone who preferred Brokeback(I'm presuming that that was the majority,although there could've been a strong contingent of Good Night and Good Luck,Munich and Capote fans out there,too)have to take their shots at Crash,which to me is HIGHLY unfair. Crash is an excellent piece of story-telling,and it DOES have social significance in today's society(unless you believe racism has been ended for good...anyone?)!This tapestry of characters in Los Angeles go though events over a less than 48 hour period where stereotypes,frustrations,apprehensions,bad decisions,pride and assumptions become confronted,overcome and realized. Among the players:a seemingly racist patrolman(Matt Dillon,very good),his idealistic partner(Ryan Phillipe,better than expected),a slick police detective with a troubled past(Don Cheadle,good as ever),a family of middle eastern shop keepers,wary as ever about being robbed and attacked, an accomplished black couple(Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton) who don't realize how close they are to being mistreated for their race, a rich,politically connected couple(Sandra Bullock and Brendan Frasier)who get to experience the unattractive part of the city they live and thrive in and react differently and the two buddies(Ludicrous and Dato Bakthadzhe???)who argue as they carjack in the richer part of the city. These are the flash-points--but not even close to the only--people they rub off against in a portrait of racial attitudes in a large,overheated city.Paul Haggis co-wrote and directed this film,which follows strong work from screenplay writing Million Dollar Baby. This film actually seemed to do more business AFTER it went to second release,then video and I feel like word-of-mouth helped it to reach the rarefied status it's reached. Regardless of whether it won an Oscar,a Golden Globe or any other award(save maybe a Razzie),it IS,was and always will be a quality film. To set its value against any other film on terms of social or redeeming value to me is like comparing apples and oranges and is completely useless. The rough,unflinching story-telling makes this movie VERY memorable,and THAT is what this movie should be judged on.",10,0,5,6 April 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Maybe not the best movie you'll ever see,but unique enough to be hard to forget
","Set in the waning years of WWII and amidst the long,bloody and somewhat confusing conflict of Civil WAr Spain,Pan's Labryth is a blending of dark,Gothic,serio-religious(think C.S.Lewis or the like)fantasy with the grim historic reality of the region. THe central character,a shy,bookish girl named Ofelia(Ivana Baquero)uncovers a maze and sub-world of fairies and woodland creatures,who cross into her world presenting solutions as well as to problems with her fragmented family: her widowed,pregnant and sick mother(Ariadna Gil),her vile and sadistic stepfather(Sergi Lopez,awesome here!),who happens to be a military commander for the FAscists,the well-intentioned head maid-servant(Maribel Verdu)and the rural farm estate where they are quartered and just also happens to be in the middle of a battle hot zone between rebels and Fascists.Director,writer and co-producer Guillermo del Toro,more known for his brilliantly crafted Comic book/fantasy/SciFi work(Hellboy and this summer's Hellboy 2 come to mind),is able to craft a bright,unique and largely enthralling story. While I cannot give this a higher mark than I have,due mostly in part to the fact that this film is over-ambitious by that and a half(mostly by amping the emotional conflicts and making the foreshadowing more like overshadowing) and seems to leave gaps in its story(how could Ofelia's mother be so oblivious to her new husband's cruelty? what exactly was the nature of her mother's illness? Also,leaving too much detail and information about the newly created world of the movie vague and without definition). I'll confess that movies entirely done in native language and subtitles also doesn't exactly make an easy digest for me,but as such this movie was still quite watchable.This film,if memory serves,got A LOT of good pres when it was first released,and managed to come away with its fair share of awards. I managed to miss this completely from the original run,mostly because it stayed mostly in the domain of 'artsy' movie houses and away from the mainstream theaters of smaller,non-metropolitan areas(and Topeka,KS fits that description quite well)for much of its first release. I'd always meant to see this,and having finally done so,I'm glad I did. A beautifully-made movie that is able to make its heart and originality work,albeit not flawlessly.",8,1,5,22 August 2008
Knocked Up," Rare breed of comedy that's crude,smart AND touching
","Upon watching this movie recently,I was(among many thoughts)reminded of another 'Pregnancy changes everything' comedy: Nine Months from 1995. That film,directed by Chris Columbus and starring Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore,also featured an unplanned pregnancy that was forcing an otherwise relaxed,responsibility-free(relatively)bachelor to commit to the child he's helped create AND the relationship he was in. The differences,however,are loud and clear: where 'Months' was played for slap-sticky,almost cruel laughs and shameless manipulation(and hence the reason I've practically sworn off ANYTHING Mr.Columbus writes or directs),'Knocked' is actually done with a sense of wit,savvy,solid character study and very deliberate,studied injections of sentiment.Schlubby,beefy slacker Ben Stone(Seth Rogen,who looks about five to ten years OLDER than his actual age)lives with his buddies with the intent that breaks down to two(make it three)elements:movies(and the knowledge of all things related),music and getting stoned. The collective ambition of he and his buddies(JOnah Hill,Jason Segel,Martin Starr and Jay Baruchel)is to start a website that is able to document any and all actresses who are naked in movies down to the minutes and frames. Meanwhile,pretty,well-adjusted and responsible Allison Scott(Katherine Heigl,a hybrid of the girl-next-door and a human Barbie doll)is seeing her career rise as she's promoted from behind-the-camera staff for E! Television to on-air personality. She and some girlfriends go to celebrate the promotion at a local nightclub.At said nightclub,the two opposites meet,charm and attract. Of course,it doesn't take anyone of great genius or intuitive skill to figure,from the title of the film,that their dalliance--a sweaty,sloppy fête accompli at her(?) place--will yield something more than merely sex tales of conquest for him and a possible 'I did that?' recollection from her.As both Ben and Allison agree to work through the pregnancy together(A decision that takes remarkably little angst from both parties),their winding,twisting road toward love is,of course,not lacking bumps and potholes,many of them inadvertently supplied by each others' supports: his buddies and her sister and best friend Debbie(Leslie Mann,getting a seemingly rare chance to expand on a role) and her husband Pete(Paul Rudd,more comfortable than ever as a down-to-earth 'Guy's guy' in film). Of course,the obstacles that Ben and Allison themselves have to overcome prove to be the most important to the story.Director/writer Judd Apatow doesn't miss a beat from 2005's 40 Year Old Virgin, making what could be arch-type characters and comedic situations actually have sympathy to cut the sharp edges of pathos and profanity. He is also able to make even some of the more secondary or tertiary characters(i.e. the slough of OBGYNs that work on Allison,Pete and Debbie's daughters, Allison's co-workers,her mom,Ben's dad,the girlfriend of one of Ben's friends)funny and interesting,which seems to be asking a lot of a lot of directors and/or screenwriters. Last but not least,the warm,scuzzy charm of Rogen and the soft,oh-so-human Heigl give very fitting and grounded performances. It may not be quite as daft a movie as 'Virgin',but it's made with such intelligence that it EASILY runs circles around just about any movie(genre alike or no)this summer. Pregnancy movies can be played for easy laughs or hard. The more difficult laughs are more rewards,thus so is this film.",9,2,7,17 June 2007
Alien," Creating a Sci-Fi/Horror hybrid that still resonates
","From Horror movie/Science Fiction film encyclopedias and books on film theory I've read,whenever the story on Ridley Scott's Alien is brought up,there is some mention on the way the show was received when it was first released in the late Spring,early Summer of 1979,was something akin to a truly jarring discovery. And,indeed,looking back on it now,how WOULDN'T a movie set in outer space that involves the following elements: a bleak,non-descript future,seven characters who are neither scientists nor space heroes/fighters and a sleek,nightmarish looking creature with awesome and unearthly traits(i.e. acid for blood,parasitic reproduction,an exponential growth rate among them),be a shock to audiences who were primarily used to more conventional forms of alien life(examples:The Day the Earth Stood Still,2001:A Space Odyssey,George Pal's War of the Worlds,Star Wars,Star Trek)or the future for that matter(again with Star Trek or 2001). Even in Howard HAwks' The Thing(remember,this is 1979,three years before John CArpenter envisioned the same movie),the killer creature seemed to take on a familiar face,even it was similarly lacking in mercy or reasoning as the creature in this movie. Approaching thirty years after its release,Alien still inspires imagery that is as wild and fantastic as it is horrific and sickening. You're probably familiar with the story by now: The Nostromo(which is something akin to an interstellar cargo/trucking ship)is signaled to a barely charted and presumably unsettled planet in the dark reaches of the galaxy. The crew of seven with the aid of an overhead computer named 'Mother' investigate.When one of the members of the exploration group,is attacked by a small indescribable alien creature on the planet's surface,he inadvertently brings aboard an unknown and highly deadly insect-like life-form that picks off each member of the defenseless crew aboard their ship after they depart the planet. Three of the crew,Ripley(Sigourney Weaver,in really her first major role and what a role it was!),PArker(Yaphet Kotto)and Lambert(Veronica Cartwright) discover that this stowaway may be more than a mere incidental pick-up,it becomes as much a battle for individual survival as it is trying to desperately rid themselves of the unwanted visitor.Ridley Scott has since crafted quite the compendium of films,ranging in scope and material,from the awesome sense of machinery and the future in such pictures as this one and Blade Runer,to sometimes much more sublime,yet awesome imagery like Thelma and Louise or Someone to Watch Over Me(or,for that matter,awesome,Sci-fi-like imagery and epic power like Gladiator),but it was this movie that put him on the map. Using a fairly unknown cast at the time(Tom Skerritt is the closest to an 'established' star at the time,even though Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Kotto were well-regarded character actors before and after this movie),and an ambitious script by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Schusett,Scott is able to create something that,like the creature itself,laid an egg in movie-viewing psyches and hatched something awesome. Spawning(no pun intended)three(not counting Alien vs.Predator)sequels so far,this movie has created quite the fertile storyline for strings of graphic novels and fanfics. My personal experience with it was watching something out of anxious curiosity:I finally watched it as a much older person(I was only seven when this show was released,and this is SO NOT a movie for the kiddies!)and it was tough for me to sit still through much of it,even KNOWING much of what was coming from reading synapses and hearing other people's stories of seeing it. Perhaps not a must of movie viewing,but a VERY effective movie-viewing experience!",9,0,1,21 April 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," On it's own merits,it's very good...
","...but put up against the stage production(and it DOESN'T have to be Broadway,btw),and this seems to be a little incomplete. Still,it's quite a show.Benjamin Barker has returned to London after fifteen years in prison(and,one can assume,enduring some very de-humanizing experiences there)for a charge that is never elaborated upon,not that it really matters. He's lost his business,his wife and his young child and,back in 1850s(I'm guess-timating)England,he's retained his long memory to add to plying his craft to exact his revenge. Now as the dour Sweeney Todd(Johnny Depp,plying himself ably in a role I,honestly, WOULDN'T have figured was truly meant for him),he's carefully enacted his plan while bordering over the business of the gruff,morally gray pie-maker Mrs.Lovett(Helena Bonham Carter,who,to me,was actually the truest find her,singing AND acting)who becomes his accomplice.The strength of this show,be it on stage or here on screen,IS the music and the voices that fill it,and they don't disappoint. Depp's Todd is flawless,but I found myself more impressed with the performances of Bonham Carter(mentioned earlier),Alan Rickman(as the cruel and overbearing Judge Turpin),SAsha BAron Cohen(as the rival barber Pirelli)and Ed Sanders as the boy Toby,whose duet with Mrs.Lovett on 'Not While I'm Around' is one of the best movie song sequences I've seen in a while!Director Tim Burton's dark,sinister treatment of Stephen Sondheim's book and music seems like a good fit,and for the most part it does go together evenly. While I feel like this story and the music are better suited for the stage,I credit Burton and company with being able to make it easily workable on the big screen.My rating might improve on 'Sweeney' with another viewing or two. While I cannot ply the title 'Best movie of '07' on this(nor do I feel any sense that the wrong call was made when it didn't get a Best pic/director nod by the academy recently),I certainly was impressed with the general construct and execution of the grizzly legend of tall tale and stage.",8,0,2,31 January 2008
Blades of Glory," Good 'empty-calorie' comedy!
","Two male figure skaters of distinctly different personalities: Graceful,girlish and innocent Jimmy MacElroy(Jon Heder,who takes comedic physical abuse better than just about anybody!)and boorish,Alpha-MAle and sex-addicted hotshot Chazz Michael Michaels(Will Ferrell,back to his usual,oily,near-improvisational comedic self)have battled each other constantly over the better part of the last decade,finally have their rivalry come to a head in the Olympics,which leads to both skaters being banned from competitive skating for life.Of course,that can't be the end of story and,sure enough,when alerted to the loophole in the competition rules of the sport,Jimmy seeks to find someone to pair with to compete in pairs figure skating. Of course,he has absolutely no luck finding a female,but bumps into Chazz--now a washed out actor at a 'Disney-on-Ice'-style show--and is talked into,by his similarly burned-out mentor(Craig T.Nelson,not-too-gruff),pairing up with his former bitter rival to recapture some of their previous glory.With super support from the villains of the movie,that being in the form of a brother-sister pairs combo(played with the right amount of sneer by comic aces Will Arnett and Amy Poehler),this film runs with the predictability of a Swiss watch. Ditto that of the sweet potential love interest(a charming and sexy-cute Jenna Fischer)and at least one cameo of the usual suspects of Ferrell-based comedies:Luke Wilson as a sex addiction counselor. Directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck,chartering a story and script by Busy Phillips and John Altschuler,are nearly transparent here,as you the viewer,if you seen any films like this(i.e. Old School,Talledega Nights for examples)coming miles away. For the most part,though,I didn't mind at all. Unabashedly over-the-top and tailored to fit the stars of the show(particularly Ferrell),this film makes no apologies for being a loud,colorful and vulgar comedy. My summary line comes from my theory that many comedies,particularly ones that are major studio financed and fronted by bankable stars,have a quality similar to empty-calorie or junk food: incredibly tasty,immediately satisfying and utterly lacking of anything of deeper value. Still,films like this are good palate-cleansers,particularly after a winter and fall season of movies where the solid quality lie in mostly dark,searing dramas(examples:Letters from Iwo JIma,Breach) and inventive,sanguinary action movies(example:300). Bottom line: I laughed enough to find this well-worth the viewing experience,and assuming you aren't prejudiced by who or what is in this offering,I suspect many of you will feel the same,too.",7,0,0,14 April 2007

He is also getting frustrated with being the cook at the monastery/orphanage he has lived and worked at since he was a kid. With the help of a street urchin he meets(he's mugged BY said urchin)while running an errand for the chief Abbott,he takes to the ring,training regimen,stretchy pants,mask and all,keeping a secret life from the orphanage,his superiors and a pretty nun(Ana de la Ruegera,breathtakingly beautiful!)he fancies.Directed and co-written by Jared Hess,he of Napoleon Dynamite fame,this film has plenty of the ear-marks of ND:still shots of people with people coming into the frame from the sides,still shots of plates of food and plenty of physical slapstick. This is hardly a great film:it feels a little forced in terms of character chemistry,and the story seems to be a bit sloppily conceived,but this film delivers enough laugh-out-loud moments that it redeems itself. I'm not sorry I didn't catch this in the theater,and really,this film would make as good a cheap rent or something on cable if you were just passing the time.

Closer," Easy to respect,tough to like
","This film,about the revolving relationships between two couples,is a very heady and strong effort by all involved,but it is tough to feel much sympathy or likability for nearly everyone involved. Julia Roberts' Anna can't seem to be trusted to hold onto a relationship,Jude Law's Dan can't be trusted to do the right thing once in one,Clive Owen's Larry is a thick-headed professional sort who can't seem to decide whether or not he's truly in love with either Annd or Alice,and Natalie Portman's Alice(probably the most sympathetic of the bunch)is so fragile and delicate that she's always on the verge of dropping a relationship at the turn of an emotion.I've read one review that says that this movie is 'as real as it gets'. Really? How many random foursomes of people in a large city(in this case,London)constantly go pin-balling back and forth between each other,regardless of the fact that they are both so cruel to each other in the first place? I would wager that here are very real elements of real life relationships in this movie,but as a whole,the personal dynamics of this film are much more convoluted than what you would ordinarily get in a true life interchange of couples.The acting is strong,and the writing seems better suited for the stage. Certainly not bad enough to give a low rating,but not worth a rave,either.",6,0,0,19 April 2005
Elf," Not quite a classic,but worth the watch all the same.
","Buddy the Elf(Will FArrell,still not yet a star at this point)has never truly been an elf. But raised from infancy in the North POle and knowing nothing other than the Elf lifestyle,he is as true a helper to old St.Nick as any of the other workers that are. At full adulthood and finally starting to realize that he's not like the others back home,he sets out for New York City to find his true family,mostly his father(JAmes Caan),now a Department store exec. I suspect that one need only see the trailers to figure that when Buddy finds his true father,a host of blissfully nutty events ensues.No surprises in this film,from the hi-jinx promised to the obligatory romance for BUddy,personned in this case by a bored but decent department store worker(Zooey Deschenal,neither too sweet nor too sour). The casting is so letter perfect it seems almost brainless:Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father,Ed Asner as Santa Claus,MAry Steenburgen as Caan's understanding wife,Andy Richter and Kyle Gass as Caan's underlings,Amy Sedaris as Caan's sweet secretary and Peter Dinklage as a very un-elf-life storybook author who looks like he could be a perfect ringer for one of Kris Kringle's workers. Director Jon FAvreau's movie moves as easily as any,and while I personally wouldn't call this a 'new classic'(though it would still seem like MIracle on 34th Street compared with another holiday themed film that came out around that time,Bad Santa)in Yule flicks,this makes for perfectly fine holiday themed entertainment.",8,0,1,18 December 2008
Capote," More about 'In Cold Blood' than the author himself
","Director Bennett Miller and writer Dan Futterman(adapting from a book by Gerald Clarke)bring to this screen a restrained,haunting story of Truman Capote's research and writing of the 1964 'true-crime,non-ficiton'novel 'In Cold Blood'. I presume that the film is named and centered around the flamboyant and brilliant writer and social gadabout because there was no more concise way to describe the way this news story phenomenon could be laid out.Capote(deservedly award winning Philip Seymour Hoffman,who really is no surprise here,since he's had over a decade of palpably good film performances)is a unique portrayal here: he is never completely sympathetic(is he on the side of the shell-shocked townsfolk of Holcombe,KAnsas or is he merely exploiting their fear?Is he really sympathetic with Perry Smith or merely using him for the book? Is he really in need of peeling away at a social disconnect in American society or is he merely an opportunist?),but he is always compelling. CAtherine Keener's Harper Lee,friend,confidant and steely incorruptible, is well-done as well. Other standouts in the movie are Clifton Collins gives a sad and yet scary portrayal as Smith and Chris Cooper makes the most of a reduced character in KBI chief Alvin Dewey.The quiet,meticulous sound-editing and soundtrack add to the meditative,blank mode that this movie tries to convey. Thought-provoking and strong,this film is for everyone who wonders how 'trainwrecks' can become the fascination of one and many,based in an era where there were fewer media outlets and more palpable innocence. 10 out of 10",10,1,1,29 March 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," Should we be looking for a Fourteen?
","After seeing Ocean's Twelve not quite three years ago,I wasn't sure if the idea of making another Ocean's film would be such a good idea. But hearing and reading the reviews of this movie convinced me to invest in this sequel(amongst a summer of high profile sequels),and I'm pretty happy I did. As for my summary line,after seeing this offering,a sequel doesn't seem like such a bad idea anymore.The story is probably tighter than the previous two movies: Casino owner and LAs Vegas old guard Reuben Tishkoff(Elliott Gould)has a massive heart attack when he is basically swindled by an over-aggressive casino entrepreneur named Willie Bank(Al Pacino,dialing it down to be as dry and quietly menacing as he is unscrupulous). News travels relatively quickly to Tishkoff's friends,aka the gang from the previous fixes: Danny Ocean(George Clooney,really smooth,even for himself),Rusty Ryan(Brad Pitt,not even needing deodorant for this film!),Linus Caldwell(Matt Damon,resting up for the third Bourne movie),Livingston Dell(Eddie Jemison),Frank Catton(Bernie Mac,in a role he seems born to play),BAsher Tarr(Don Cheadle,happy to take lighter stuff as always),Yen(Shaobo Qin,doing a little more than neat stunts this time),the Malloy brothers(Scott Caan and CAsey Affleck)and Saul Bloom(Carl Reiner,as sharp as ever at 85),and they all agree to enact revenge on Bank. It's ultimately agreed upon that the best revenge on Bank is to sink his brand new casino hotel,and the plot to do so is set into a looming,looping,exacting motion,as usual.Featuring some fairly inspired secondary performances by Ellen Barkin(as BAnk's sexy,exacting assistant),Eddie Izzard(As a new investor to bankroll Ocean),Robert Einstein(aka 'Super'DAve Osborne,as a Vegas gaming fed),David Paymer(as an unassuming-looking hotel reviewer who's about to have one of the lousiest hotel stays of his life)and Andy Garcia(back as one-time and possibly future nemesis,Casino boss Terry Benedict),this movie moves in brisk,sharp,clean strokes,complete with set-up,enactment and completion,all documented in an efficient,multi-screened stream of events. Director Steven Soderberg doesn't seem to care that elements of the film seem either vague or rough,preferring to allow the film-goer either take it or leave it as a finished product. Some may not care for it,I didn't mind it at all. Where 'Eleven' was stylish and almost ruthless in its style,and 'Twelve' had a promising set-up and effortlessly likable first half undermined by an utterly confusing last half,this movie returns to the original formula for the most part,and to me,the best parts of this film may also be what makes it less than perfect:that is,it's easy flow,quickness and lack of interest in the core details of the job. Still,I can let it go if a movie about a massive con isn't interested in plying the whole craft before the viewer as long as said movie still keeps it entertaining and quick,and I'm happy to say 'Thirteen' does just that.",8,0,1,28 June 2007
Lost in Translation," No Translation Necessary{spoilers possible}
","At least there was none needed for me,as I thought this film was a pleasant,thoughtful and intelligent study in characters.Bob Harris(Bill Murray,reaching a new frontier in his long career:that of the quietly despairing middle-aged white male)is completely out of his element. He is alone,on a commercial shoot in Tokyo. He knows no one there,keeps to himself and drinks to fill the voids. He is an actor who(we are to deduce)at one time had a much more successful career,but he's making the best of things now. He is separated from his family and probably would feel a disconnect from them even if he weren't separated by an ocean and hemisphere.Charlotte(Scarlett Johanssen,matching the character descript almost to a T)is married to a photographer(Giovanni Ribisi,not really in much of the picture)and her reason for being in the Land of the Rising Sun is fairly simple:her husband is doing a long and extensive photo shoot there and he wants her along. Of course,he doesn't bring her along for his work,and it gives her plenty of time to stay in her hotel room and get bored. She's married young,and(we are also led to believe)she feels like maybe she's done the wrong thing,as much as she loves her husband. Also lonely,unable to speak a word of Japanese and restless,she roams the Hotel to break the monotony.This is how our two main characters meet,and through their meeting,they develop a sort of bonding that's just short of sexual and a little past emotional. To call this an 'Affair of the Heart' might be over-simplified,but it seems like it might be the closest thing to what is at play here. As the movie progresses,the two understand each other and become quietly pushed to make a decision about that.Very solid acting performances,great imagery(I was in Tokyo once,over twenty-five years ago,and although it was for a very short time,one could get a sense that they were dwarfed in that city even for a short stay!)and a smart,seamless direction and script from capable director Sofia Coppola make this movie unique and valuable. This is strictly a talking,seeing and feeling movie,so people with no patience for pure character studies need not apply. This one's for those who like unconventional relationship stories and the very real people who are known to inhabit them.",9,2,4,6 December 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," She may not be ALL Devil...
","...but she runs her workplace like Hell.Fresh-faced and ambitious college grad Andrea'Andy'Sachs(Anne Hathaway,a perfect blend of gawky and pretty)has bitten off more than she can chew when she's brought on as assistant(one of them,actually)to Miranda Priestly(Meryl Streep,in probably her best pure role in what feels like ages),a cutting,cynical,cruel and demanding she-beast who runs Runway,a sort of Cosmopolitan-type magazine. She meets(at first)little help from her immediate peers at the magazine,particularly Miranda's established assistant Emily(Emily Blunt,with some of the best lines in the movie)and Nigel(Stanley Tucci,shaved and stylish),and has to rely on her savvy,determination and charm to try to work the job to her advantage. Of course,this being a comedy,she is able to do just that,but in the process,she starts to lose her friends,particularly her boyfriend(Adrian Greiner).This film,when you strip away the strong,strong performances,feels pretty predictable(In fact,to me it felt like this movie took on some shades of Pretty Woman). And the added potential romantic entanglement that comes in the form of a renowned journalist(Simon Baker)seems kind of forced. The amount of times that Hathaway's character is referred to as either 'fat' or 'ugly' by people around the office,while understandable coming from the obsessed-with-skinny-tanned-and-chic fashionistas,still is galling. To be honest,the whole fashion industry theme of the film pretty much chased me away from seeing this in the theaters,and had Ms.Streep not been nominated for an Academy Award,I'm not sure I would've rented this DVD while it was still a 'New Release'. Still,this movie is entertaining,mostly on the backs of Streep,Blunt,HAthaway and Tucci,with help from a sharp script by Arline Bosh McKenna(adapting off Lauren Weisberger)and direction from David Frankel. If you are somewhat(or completely)fashion-phobic,you might be intimidated by this film,and who knows if you'd care for it or not,but this film is actually anything BUT a celebration of the industry,and the comedy that comes from it is worth a look.",7,0,0,4 March 2007
Forrest Gump," The Quintessential,20th Century Southern Tall-tale
","Winston Groom's novel was optioned to PAramount in 1986 and spent about seven years gathering dust before Robert Zemekis wanted to option this into a movie. Eric Roth agreed to pen the screenplay adaptation,and with some fortuitous and shrewd casting(fortuitous=freshly Oscar-minted Tom Hanks,shrewd=Gary Sinise,Sally Field,Robin Wright and Mykelti Williamson)mixed in with clever CGI,a little novel that had a cult following and was nearly forgotten became a Runaway Summer Box Office success and a Academy Award winner. Such is the story of the making of Forrest Gump. I tell this,because the actual story of the film is pretty well understood by now: slow,possibly retarded Southerner Forrest Gump(Hanks,very un-Hanks-like and probably why he drew a second Oscar)is waiting on a bus to visit the love of his life,a troubled woman named Jenny(Robin Wright,nearly unrecognizable from her days as a soap actress or even from Princess Buttercup in The Princess Bride). While waiting,he--in his beguiling and completely unaffected manner--begins to tell strangers who happen by to wait on a bus about his story,and what a story it is! Born of a unwed mother(Sally Field),he overcomes a birth disorder to become a champion runner, a college football star(at Alabama for legendary coach Paul'Bear'Bryant!),a war hero in Vietnam,a champion Ping Pong player and a successful entrepreneur. Along the way,he is able to touch the lives(and one has to assume,IS touched by)of the people who he works around and with,particularly his CO in 'Nam(Sinise in arguably the most haunting performance of the show),his equally slow bunk mate in the Army(Williamson,unfairly ignored for this performance)and,of course,Jenny. But while Forrest leads a Pangloss/Zelig type life through the turbulent period of time that defined the Baby Boomer generation,he's still looking for the love that Jenny seems so reluctant to give.To be real honest,the gild on this Lily for me has came off over the years(I absolutely LOVED this film when I saw it in a crowded movie theater on JUly 4th weekend,1994),partly due to the over-abundance of publicity that this film received over the nearly seven months that it was in first-run theatrical release. Also,I wasn't entirely convinced that this movie deserved all the awards mantle ware that it received. But I've seen this movie at least twice in its entirety and probably as many as seven or eight times in bits and pieces,plus I own the VHS tape and may someday want to get the DVD,so I feel like for the most part,this film is still special to me. I think that's because of the summary line:behind the stars,the big-time production,the awards,the frills,the publicity(Bubba Gump cookbooks,T-Shirts,etc.),lies what can be simply put as a Southern Tall tale,meant to enchant and inspire the imagination,set to a period of time(namely,the Western world,circa 1946 to 1981)that is generally regarded as anything but inspirational or enchanting. This film is for anyone who wants to believe in larger-than-life tales set in the real world. An unforgettable film,indeed.",8,1,4,31 December 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Buckle up for another ride with Bourne
","Black Ops Amnesiac/Killing machine Jason Bourne(Matt Damon,as grim and efficient as ever)has once again re-surfaced,this time in Russia,still not entirely sure of how he became who he became,but now with a better idea of who he is(a la the previous two films). He is starting to put the pieces together,particularly the connection he has with a project named 'Greenbriar'. He finds his target source in an investigative reporter in England named Ross(Paddy Considine).Meanwhile,back in the states,the NSA gets word of Bourne's re-appearance and this time,a mid-level counter-terrorism director named Vosen(David Straithairn,as effective as a humorless,undaunted bureaucrat/villain as he is playing more noble characters,if not more so)agrees to try to eliminate Bourne,viewed as an embarrassing remnant of a project they'd just as soon forget they'd chartered. Chargfed with oversight of this project once again is PAmela Landy(Joan Allen,tall,stately dame extraordinaire),who has a better understanding of who Bourne is and how to handle him. Naturally,she is ignored by Vosen,who chooses to merely smoke him out and terminate him and,predictably,fails at every turn.As Bourne gets closer to what he wants to find,he encounters another familiar face: Op Low-level techie Nicky Parsons(Julia Stiles,with progressively more in this film than she did the previous two),and she aids him along. It's of little surprise that her aiding him makes her as much a target as he,and the tension mounts as he has to both protect her as well as get himself out of the cross-hairs of some determined and skilled assassins.Having seen the previous two films,and the memories of the ad campaigns from this summer,I got no surprises in seeing this film. Having waited until this made it to dollar films(and I'm not sure exactly WHY I waited for it. Money,I suppose),I feel like I have little to complain about if I found any shortcomings or deficiencies in it. I didn't(for the most part)and thought this was executed faithfully,effectively and competently. While the entertainment value of this movie and the series(which is bound to happen with ANY sequel)depreciating some--I mean,face it,the element of surprise and revelation seems to get smaller with each film,this time involving a previously un-referenced top level government Doc(Albert Finney,sounding a lot like Brian Cox in blurry flashbacks)--this is still a satisfying watch. Director Paul Greengrass returns to this franchise(having garnered impressive reviews for 2006's United 93)and employs the elements of moving,shaky camera to an effect I could appreciate. Instead of playing the action as something to be impressed by,the filming of the movie's action scenes are done more to an effect to give an element of confusion and de-romanticize the violence in play.For the most part,that impressed me,if it didn't always enchant me. Tehe element of suspense manages to build to a crescendo at the 2/3 point of the movie,with a particularly effective chase through a maze of apartments in Tangiers. THe screenplay by Tony Gilroy and Scott Burns is pretty lean,preferring let the verbal interplays between characters simply frame and take backseat to the action.The one common trait of all the Bourne films(And perhaps for most,if not all,Robert Ludlum novels and their adaptations) is still plenty of frenetic violence,choreographed and yet raw. Put simply,when you sit down for a Bourne movie,I think it goes without saying that you're gonna need to 'buckle up' for the ride.As such,I found this ride quite satisfying,albeit a bit routine and bumpy.",8,0,1,9 November 2007
The Aviator," 'Citizen Kane' light
","Billionaire entrepreneur,raconteur and legend Hoawrd Hughes led two lives. One,as a handsome,charismatic young dreamer who was able to spin gold out of straw,creating planes that worked and movies that sold. The other was the OCD-hobbled eccentric who furiously bucked the system he also wanted to serve. The bridge between these two is explored in Martin Scorcese's nearly three hour long epic.Leonard DiCaprio's Hughes makes up for a physical lack of authenticity(he stays fairly boyish looking through two decades of change,including after surviving a life-threatening plane crash!)by being able to commit to the passion and affliction that was Howard. His willingness to sacrifice his body and portray a mental illness that is somewhat difficult to encapsulate is nothing short of remarkable. HAving said that,probably the real standout here was CAte Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. I suppose it betrays a lack of movie sophistication to admire an actor for their ability to mimic a real celebrity(and my familiarity with KAte may not be THE best) but it's still hard to forget ones that are dead-on(Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison comes to mind)and Blanchet's KAte Hepburn is just that! Her vocal cadence,speed of talking and her general demeanor of defiance seemed to so mark Miss Hepburn's persona. She is a unique person for her era and she is very aware of it,and her being different is at least in part why she can recognize and love Howard for his quirks and style.The heavies are a senator from Maine(Alan Alda,very good here)and the President and CEO of Pan-Am Airlines(Alec Baldwin,not especially memorable but still serviceable),the latter having the former in his deep,influential pockets. The tricks that they play on Hoawrd's state of mental health SEEM minor,but are actually quite insidious and snide(e.g.blowing cigar smoke his direction,leaving fingerprints on his drinking glass,serving food bloody and rare). The rest of the cast rounds out nicely with John C. Reilly(as NOah Dietrich,Howard's longtime bookkeeper and friend),Adam Scott(as JOhnny,Howard's longtime associate and confidant),KAte Beckingsale(as Ava GArdener,who also had a short and tempestuous affair with Mr.HUghes),Gwen Stefani(appropriate as Jean HArlow),MAtt Ross,Kelli Garner,and Brent Spiner. Cameos by Jude Law and Willem DaFoe catch the eye but have only small impact on the film.While I cannot quite call this film a classic,it is still a very worthy movie to watch,especially if you are interested in 20th-Century American history and the impact of celebrity has on it. Also,Mr.Hughes' life is very fascinating,IMHO. The title line of my review isn't to say that I believe that Mr. Hughes and C.F.Kane's(proxy to W.R.Hearst) life stories are direct parallels,but that the aim of both movies seems to be the same. Namely,the documenting of a great,brilliant man whose sense of ego and frailty become to(greater or lesser degrees)his undoing. While lacking full originality,either in subject or approach, it still is able to evoke interest and personality,which makes the awards it was nominated for(And the relative few that it won)quite deserving.",9,0,0,6 June 2005
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Effective movie that is neither too funny nor too grim
","I just sat through a DVD of this movie,the second(?)time I'd seen this film. The last time I could recall seeing this,it was on pay-per-view television in a hotel(the Red Lion I think it was) room,August of 1988,so my memories of this film could use a refreshing. I'm glad I got refreshed.In 1965,Airman Adrian Cronauer(Robin Williams,in the first of his four Academy Award nominations)is brought on to do an Armed Forces Radio stint in Vietnam. Behind the microphone,Cronauer lets loose,much to the surprise and delight of many of the troops and servicemen around the area of combat. His combination of off-the-wall humor,impressions,sound gags and quick wit,mixed with his love of free-wheeling Rock music of the era,is pretty much welcomed in the area,save for a few angry sorts: a Napoleon-complexed intermediate CO named Hauk(Bruno Kirby,unrecognizable but for the voice) and a stiff-lipped,quietly vindictive middle commander named Dickerson(J.T.Walsh,so good here it would seem like this typecast him). As this is going on,Cronauer becomes smitten with a local girl(Chinatra Sukapatra,spelling?)and befriends her brother(Tung Thanh Tran),which leads the popular DJ down a road of self-discovery.With excellent support from Forrest Whitaker(one of my favorites!he ends up sort of counter-balancing Williams' manic frenzy with nerdish normalcy as his buddy/assistant/guide),Richard Edson,Noble Winnigham,Robert Wuhl and Cu Ba Nguyen(as the oily GI bar proprietor)among others,this film,directed by Barry Levinson(whose work hasn't been this good in what feels like forever,certainly not since Avalon or Rain Man) and written by Mitch Markowitz,it is arguable one of the deftest films to create and maintain a balance between the horrors and inhumanity of war and the humor and pathos that are very much present in it. Robin Williams' fans may get much more out of this that those who aren't,but I think even many of those who don't consider themselves fanciers of his talents should be able to appreciate this. The images were powerful enough that they stuck with me some after the first time I saw GMV and after a second time I feel like can appreciate even more out of this movie.",9,39,45,30 July 2006
Burn After Reading," The Laughs are there. It's up to you to find them.
","I've sampled some of the comments on this movie and,while most are quite positive(as this one aims to be as well),the negative comments went something to the tune of this:people acting stupid and situations not making any sense blah blah blah I was bored. This sucks! etc.Well,folks,did you honestly expect a Coen Bros. suspense/comedy to be linear or NOT over-the-top? Seriously?Following the monster success of No Country for Old Men,Joel and Ethan roll out a bizarre,wannabe spy comedy---'wannabe' because practically ever member of the central plot are convinced that they're in on something of major government intelligence and sensitivity--that seems to be cloaked in the mundane. To explain the connect among the following characters would,in my mind,be over-indulgent of myself and be risking leaking a spoiler or two: a disgruntled,unemployed CIA point-man(John Malkovich,slow-burning and emotionally irritable as ever),his brittle,cheating wife(Tilda Swinton,pitch perfect);the man she's cheating with(George Clooney),a loopy ladies man who aspires to be an entrepreneur; a strangely insecure and manic fitness trainer(Frances McDormand,in character #877 of her rich array of types she can limn flawlessly);her friend and fellow trainer(Brad Pitt,who you can tell is having fun here),a guy who's emotionally sixteen years old and has an IQ about half that;their boss(Richard Jenkins),a lovestruck sad sack; a bemused KGB man and two utterly confused CIA chiefs(David Rasche and J.K.Simmons,dryly hilarious) all are woven into this tale,patiently inserted into the storyline to make a largely effective and(I think it's safe to say)fairly unique film.While I cannot quite call this my favorite Coen brothers movie(that distinction would probably go to Raising Arizona,Fargo or The Big Lebowski),it's certainly a strong contribution to the canon. Yes,the story moves at an odd pace,the actions and events can be real head-scratchers and the performances can be very love it/hate it(particularly Pitt's and Clooney's),but the humor is definitely there,and if you can find it you will definitely like--maybe even love--Burn After Reading.",9,2,7,25 September 2008
Radio," Maybe TOO much heart
","The real life story of the relationship between South Carolina football coach Harold Jones(Ed Harris) and James Robert 'Radio'Kennedy(Cuba Gooding Jr.)is explored here over the course of the 1976-77 school year. Initially a mute,eccentric stranger who would roam the outskirts of town,listening to this broken down radio(hence his nickname),he is brought into the team and the school(After initially being mercilessly harassed and teased by some of his players)by Coach Jones,who has his own reasons for taking an interest in a person he quickly learns is disabled. As 'Radio' insinuates his way into the lives of the students,coaches and even Coach Jones' family(Debra Winger and Sarah Drew),he becomes an almost invaluable fixture around the small southern town as well as the school.There would be,actually,so many reasons to dislike this show:the story is painfully predictable,the writing starts to creak and crack when it tries too hard to push buttons(one example:when someone mentions how well Radio has learned since coming to the school,HAnna High,the response is 'No,we haven't been teaching him,he's been teaching us!') and it is fairly vague as to much of Radio's actual life or personality,with the exception of his hard-working and skeptical mother(S.Epatha Markerson). But to do so would make me feel like a complete and total cad. The acting here,particularly between HArris and Gooding,is warm and endearing,and the show does good as long as it stays on a straight path of simple narrative. I would say,in the end this movie might suffer from a little too much of visceral sentiment here,choosing to wring sympathy from the audience like one wrings out a wash cloth. Certainly,people who are not a fan of warm,endearing heart-tuggers are probably going to reject this film on first glance. But it's a nice story,and being someone who's had more than his share of contact with 'special needs' people,I can't dump on this movie too much. A very good cheap rent.",7,2,3,16 March 2006
28 Weeks Later," Continuing the story afresh,top to bottom apparently
","2002's '28 Days Later...' was a huge hit on both sides of the Atlantic,so of course they(as in the producers,company and some of the creators)would feel compelled to make a sequel. And why not? When '...Days...' left off left just enough of an opening for more to this story.So it is that some seven months after the outbreak,England has been almost thoroughly ravaged by the RAge virus,but order has been restored via the U.S.Military(feeling false swelling of patriotism here),and expatriated English citizens are brought back into the country as the messes left behind are being cleaned up.A brother and sister(IMogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton,whose names will catch at least a few eyes strange,methinks)return from abroad and are greeted by their dad(Robert Carlyle,getting what seems to be a rare chance to recreate the easy-going everyman character that once made him famous in stuff like 'The Full Monty'),who appears to be the lone survivor of an attack in the country which counted among the casualties their mother(CAtherine McCormack,a lady I wish I saw more of in movies),but when the duo escape the quarantined,military sanctioned facilities to retrieve their stuff from their downtown London home,they find her alive. She,along with her kids are brought back to the facility,and while under observation,a remarkable(And chilling)secret is discovered by the staff medical captain(Rose Byrne,often confused for other pretty,doe-eyed actresses I bet),and it poses a double-edged sword for what is an actually more delicate situation to the public safety that what appears.I'll stop with the description to avoid any spoilers(though it's possible I might've already given some). I will say that once the show's action begins rolling,it is frenetic and emotionally very effective. Even though there's plenty of activity(And hence people active in it)it is actually somewhat sparse on characters,with the brother and sister as your main focal points and heroes. Solid,emotionally draining performances by Poots,Muggleton and Carlyle are supplemented by physical(if perhaps abbreviated)impact players such as Jeremy Renner(As one of the unit team snipers who decides to aid the kids) and Harold Perrineau(as a nervous chopper pilot on patrol). Director and co-writer Juan CArlos Freinadillo is brought in to replace Danny Boyle(who produces)and probably is fortunate to start with what can be considered a new deck of cards here,since the previous movie is treated entirely as given background effect. THat way,his direction and script(co-written by Rowan Joffe)gets the fresh treatment,neither aided nor hindered by the original. I wish I could honestly say that this show either was an improvement or a step-down from the first movie,but I'm not sure how to compare. I WILL say that this film enlightens the viewer from the first film as to the full nature of the calamity(taking it away,for the most part,from the concept of the carriers as being purely 'zombies'and more toward the concept of 'infectes'),which I think couches this in more grim and powerful reality. I guess I will say to those interested in catching this film,who hasn't seen the first movie to check '28 Days...'(not to be confused with '28 Days' with Sandra Bullock),because this movie,despite being populated from almost top-to-bottom with new names,the storyline is THE most important part of both films. Like the last one,it works on a deeper level than an ordinary horror film,even if it feels like it sometimes falls into the traps(i.e. underdeveloped players,shortening of logistics to speed along action,etc.)that many films of its genre does. Well worth your rental dollars.",8,1,3,23 January 2008
Armageddon," What did my sense of hearing do to offend Michael Bay??
","Or for that matter,ANYONE'S hearing. That was the question that I had from watching this film in the theater almost exactly ten years ago.This movie had the audacity to pick on another fellow summer flick,Godzilla,and while that big-budget Roland Emmerich film was certainly replete with its own over-bloated budget,frenetic special effects and silly dialog,it at least was FUN,never trying to take on any air of seriousness or emotional grand-standing like this film.YOu're probably familiar by now with it. Texas-sized asteroid head for Earth. NASA,in the person of a sober,reasoned chief(Billy Bob Thornton,still hot from his Sling Blade win from two years before)decides instead of using their best and brightest to do the dirty work,enlist the help of 'the best' team of oil-drillers(led by a sweaty,sardonic Bruce Willis). Of course,as a meteor that size hurtles to Earth,there is,of course,the natural doom that comes with it and this film spares no time in pounding away the gravity of that,with slow moving tracking shots of people all around the world looking to the sky,slow shots of large American flags,slow-mo shots of astronauts and the drill team as they're heading for their capsule(and destiny,it's implied).And of course,pre-requisite romance involving two of the cutest and least interesting characters in the show(played in utter earnest by cute Ben Affleck and pretty Liv Tyler). Wrap it some drippingly earnest Aerosmith music,and you've got 'winner' stamped all over it.A little aside here:no trade secret here but as this was released about a month after Dreamworks' Deep Impact,it and DI get comparisons to each other. To me,while DI was about as much fun to watch as watching a cancer patient slowly die,I still came away with more respect for that film than this sort of cowboy,'EArth's gonna blow up unless U.S.A. sends their toughest to save the day. YEEEEEEEHAAAAAWW!!!' film,which,besides being unnecessarily LOUD(which I think was no mistake by the filmmakers to amp the volume of an already noisy film,evidently under the principle that ear-splitting=memorable),the movie also commits the following crimes: science that was written for people who flunked science class in high school(fire and noise in space come to mind instantly);working my favorite element of this film Steve Buscemi as a likable,if sleazy,comic relief for about two-thirds of the film before trying to turn him into a treacherous character toward the end(maybe the reverse of his turn in 1997's Con Air); practically wasting Owen Wilson and character actor Will Patton in the flush to keep the cameras steady on Willis,Tyler and Affleck;not making up its mind whether it wanted to be a brainless-but-enjoyable summer action flick,a patriotic type thriller or a semi-comedic buddy-to-the-third-power flick.Another reviewer said that how DI and A differed was a matter of tastes,that people who appreciated thoughtful,more realistic dramas would appreciate DI,while action-lovers would go for A. Perhaps so,but I happen to enjoy a good brainless action figure like the next male,and I STILL found myself angry after this film. Perhaps it was mostly about my hearing that made me steamed,but that should account for something where your film enjoyment goes,right?",4,0,0,15 June 2008
The Village," More spook than spark,perhaps
","I'm gonna try to not give away any spoilers here. I'll just say that I liked this movie. I am somewhat of a fan of Mr.Shymalan(spelling?)'s films,and while 'Village' would not rank as my fave--that distinction would belong to 'Unbreakbale'--I still thought this movie was not bad at all. Excellent mood and tension is built up throughout,regardless of how you felt about the show.In rural Western Pennsylvania,some time during the 19th century,a small village lives a quiet,peaceful but somewhat tenuous existence as it speaks in hushed tones of the 'creature or creatures' in the neighboring woods. When one of the younger members of the community(Juaquin Phoenix,very well-placed here)decides to go out into said woods,this sets the fearful community into a stir as the elders(led by William Hurt,perfect for this film!)try to decide whether to sanction this or not. This sets into motion a series of events that FORCES the village to send somebody into the forest and confront the danger.An excellent breakthrough performance by Bryce Dallas HOward,as the blind daughter of Hurt's elder,heads this cast,which also features Judy Greer,Adrien Brody,Sigourney Weaver and Celia Weston(among others). Careful hints are dropped during this movie to clue the viewer,which,depending on your tolerance for 'twist' endings,may or may not color your whole opinion of the film. Still,I,personally would recommend it,mostly as a sort of 'Old-fashioned campfire scare story' put to celluloid. 7.5 out of 10.",7,0,0,4 November 2005
21," Without ever having read the book,I can sense the egregious bastardization here
","I don't recall where or when I heard about some MIT students who'd managed to make a killing counting Blackjack tables throughout Vegas and(I think it was also)Atlatnic City. I'm not even sure it was the book 'Bringing Down the House' that was being discussed,but the story that 21 is based off of seemed pretty familiar to begin with. Off the top,the thought of a film on this subject populated by Kevin Spacey,Laurence Fishburne and a promising newcomer named Jim Sturgess seemed to have a lot of promise going for it.Alas,that was not the case.One of the cadre of problems I had(And I'm not alone,judging by the many comments and posts along this site) is that this is most certainly and inescapably a morality tale,established practically from the fifteen second mark of the trailer. The seduction of one Ben Campbell(Sturgess,who hopefully will get stronger material in the future)is a fairly plain one: he is,besides being an already gifted student excelling at MIT(of all places),he is a numbers whiz,whose prowess is noticed by a sharp,charismatic professor(Spacey,who's as crisp and interesting in the first half of the film as he is dull and one-dimensional in the second half),who draws him into his team of fellow math whizzes/grifters who routinely go to Sin City and work the Blackjack tables.The progression of events is pretty darned predictable,as young Ben is able to use his talents to become rich beyond his ambitions(he's of course,saving up for HArvard medical school),fall in love with a fellow student(Kate Bosworth,not very convincing here,but that might be how her part's written)and end up being the quarry of a wiry Casino security chief(LAurence Fishburne,one of the few things that didn't disappoint here)who's seen Ben and his gang there one too many times. Somehow and for some reason,the makers of this film(including director Robert Luketic,co-writers Allen GArfield and Peter Loeb)decided that to make this film would require making this sexier,sleeker,less steeped in such trivial things as veracity,thoroughness or realism. The end result is something that truly deserved a mid-winter release: full of star power,youth,sound,image,sex(restrained as it is)and at least two chase scenes but a very pedestrian story and payoff underneath. I originally considered seeing this on the big screen;now I'm not even sure if I should've paid money for it on DVD.",3,0,0,29 August 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Emitting rays of sunshine through dark characters
","The family of seven-year-old Olive(cherubic,sweet and real Abigail Breslin)decide that they are all going to pull together and take her to California to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. As seemingly normal as this seems,this is anything but.For starters,the family in question is a fragmented pastiche of individuals:dad Richard(Greg Kinnear,slowly evolving into 'Every Dad')is a motivational speaker whose career success seems to fly in the face of the programs he so fiercely subscribes,mom Sheryl(Toni Collette,another great performance)works constantly and rarely has much time to spend with her kids,older brother(step-brother)Dwayne(Paul Dano,sullen)has designs on Air Force flight school,reads Nietzsche,hates(almost)everyone and hasn't spoken in a year and the Granddad(Alan Arkin,for whom I smell a possible award nomination)is a cantankerous War vet who spends most of his days teaching his beloved granddaughter pageant routines and snorting heroin. Enter Uncle Frank(Steve Carell,for whom I'm smelling another award nom), a love-sunken professor--a Proust scholar--who just survived a suicide attempt and has the dead,sunken eyes of someone whose found little reason to live. They may all be vastly different,bickering,irritable and,at one level or another,incompatible,but they are all in the endeavor to get little Olive to the pageant,and nothing is going to stop them.Directed by Jonathan DAyton and Valerie Faris,this movie may have dark characters and less than sunny lives,but the fact that they are still able to emit humor and real pathos make them humorous and strangely reassuring. The film is paced naturally,the revelations that are made are neither overly dramatic nor unremarkable and the writing by Michael Arndt,make this a joy to watch and get involved with,from the odd beginning to the somewhat unpredictable ending. This may be giving something away about this film,but this film,after I saw it,reminded me a fair amount of Napoleon Dynamite. I'm saying no more on that.Possibly the best movie of any sort this summer!I don't know if there was intended irony or truth(or both)in the title,but either way it works. I highly recommend it.",10,1,5,3 September 2006
American Beauty," A love song for the suburban,self-perceived loser
","I struggled hard to write a summary line as well as a criticism of this show. I first saw this in the theaters in the fall of 1999,and would see it again some years later. The effect of this movie has haunted me ever since. I want to avoid using broad,philosophical,high-falluting language on this because 1)it sounds insincere 2)I don't think that I can truly say,from both an intellectual and/or emotional standpoint,can make those kinds of assessment of this movie and 3)there are LOTS of reviews/comments who already have. What I will say is that a show like this,replete with sly observation,world-weary,stripped-down approach and even gallows humor,would ALREADY be memorable with simply competent,unremarkable acting. So when Kevin Spacey,Annette Bening,Thora Birch,Chris Cooper,Wes Bentley,Peter Gallagher and Allison JAnney(among others)inhabit these characters,this show LEAPS over expectation.I realize the phrase 'not everyone's cup of tea' is overused to the point of being trite,but it really applies here,because I'm familiar with the fact that not everyone warmed up to the story of Lester Burnham(Spacey,well-worthy of his second Oscar and whatever awards he garnered),a forty-something married father of one who reaches an epiphany over his overly-routine,seemingly meaningless life in the suburbs. HIs wife Carolyn(Bening,only luckless enough to be stuck with HIlary Swank in Best Actress category),once a lovely,sexy bride has grown into an angry,uptight real estate agent who has become obsessed with climbing social ladders(mostly real estate related)and views her husband as a nothing much more than a deflated loser. His daughter JAne(BIrch,shedding much of the clean,cute 'kid'image she's developed to that point)has come to resent her sad-sack dad and is allured by the new kid next door,a dark,edgy boy(Wes Bentley,TOO good here)who quietly observes his family's behavior and sells pot...to JAne's dad among others. As this happens,Lester becomes infatuate with JAne's cheerleader peer/friend Angela(Mena Suvari,sweet,if maybe not entirely convincing),and his obsession with her,while it brightens his dull life,threatens to unravel the stability that has been carrying him and his family.Sam Mendes directorial debut,and Alan Ball's script are at once,devastating,funny,insightful,cruel,sad,unfair and even optimistic(slightly). I'd go into why this film doesn't settle well with everyone,but I think from the basic summary or synapses one would be sufficiently clued in to why. Suffice it to say,I was intrigued,and I was satisfied,though I will say that the acting was to me more overall impressive than the movie's framework,which IS high quality,but personally hit a discordant note or two(and that's mostly an emotional criticism than a content one from me). That said,any interested parties should do,as the movie's tag-line beckons,to 'look closer' at this offering.",9,0,1,29 December 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," More fun with multiple viewings
","I've seen a lot of movies in the theater(where movies SHOULD be seen),particularly since I turned eighteen which was not quite twenty years ago,so I have probably forgotten more movie experiences than some have had. I preface this comment with that because I saw this first when it was just two days freshly released, the 5th of July 1991,and I recall it(And even some of the anticipation for the film)like--if not yesterday--it was last week or last month. I got there late and had to sit and watch this WAAAAAaaaaayyyy in the back in the single seat reserved for the wheelchair patrons(I didn't quite understand that that was what those seats were for back then.Ay!). Having said all that,this filmgoing experience was STILL very memorable and quite fun.Flip forward over the years and,having seen this a number of times--in full and in partial--on big and small screens alike,but having not really sat and watched this in probably sixteen years,I bought this at the local movies and music secondhand store for a song and finally got around to watching it. Not only did I enjoy seeing this again,I think I may've actually gotten MORE out of it than before.The original HK T-800 model killing machine,so iconically fleshed out by Mr.Schwarzenegger,returns from the future to find John Connor,11(then newbie actor Edward Furlong,mixing annoying,tweener brattiness with an uncanny adult sensibility)and protect him from a new killing menace--the T-1000(Robert Patrick,then unknown and coolly menacing,counterbalancing the thunderous brute strength of Arnold's original),a liquid metal upgraded terminator with a scary efficient ability to both repair and replicate its victims and/or prey. John,despite advisement to the contrary,goes and rescues his mother,the intrepid Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton,ripped and sexy,in a haggard,toughened way that would probably change her career image permanently). Of course,becoming more and more aware of the seemingly inescapable doom of mankind's existence in the shadow of SkyNet's advent,she moves to change the future pro-actively,with interesting and even heart-breaking outcomes.Well before JAmes CAmeron became much more famous for winning awards for a faux romantic adventure about a large cruise ship sinking,he was much more remembered as making films like this:adrenaline-soaked blow-ups with unrelenting action and sharp(if perhaps a tad trite)dialog. This movie is probably king of them all. Sort of an expanded,more ambitious take on the original movie,it is more of a augmentation of the original's concept,taking it to levels it couldn't on the original's budget. Screenplay writer William Wisher is able to make the most out of clipped dialog,though the actors in place help it out immensely. A fantastic film-watching experience that only seems,like fine wine,get better with age and more viewings.",10,4,5,31 January 2009
Duck Soup," Good movie,better for the parts than the whole
","The nations of Freedonia and Sylvania are at war,much of it due to the tempers of their leaders,chiefly Freedonia's Rufus t.Firefly(Groucho Marx,quotable as ever)and the Head ambassador of Sylvania,who are both fighting for the affections of the wealthy Mrs. Teasdale(Margaret DuMont,ever hapless as the high society foil to Marx's smart-talking everyman),and it is the main framing device of this madcap comedy that probably encapsulates much of what the brothers Marx were famous for,a melange of fast wit,pratfalls,sight gags and a healthy intersperse of music.Director Leo McCarey must've figured he needn't do more than set the pace for all four brothers and let the action roll along. Clocking in at just over seventy minutes,this film seems like more of an excuse to patch together various sketches involving the Marxes,and for that this largely works. The actual larger storyline seems superfluous,even a little tedious,but then again I suppose that the screenwriters,director and stars intended to make something that was all at once ridiculous and potentially cumbersome,only to make it all unfold to a gleeful,fun-filled conclusion. This film is still very much worth the watch,and you might find it overall completely delightful as a complete product. I just felt like this film is a great assemblage of jokes and gags,strung together while a movie just happened to be occurring during it. Problems I might perceive aside,I still recommend this 'Soup'.",8,0,1,13 April 2009
Apocalypse Now," Four Years in the Making(and re-making)
","The way I am to understand it,Francis Ford Coppola got the go-ahead to film this re-adaptation(or re-envisioning)of Joseph Conrad's novella in 1974 and started filming it in 1975 or 1976.Almost four years,plenty of re-shooting,a near feud with Universal over the production and one heart attack(Martin Sheen's)later and the film finally got released in 1980. Good reviews couldn't save it from being a very modest producer at the Box Office,but cable,VHS,DVD rentals have garnered it a cult following(not to mention a re-released,uncut edition)and I COMPLETELY understand why.The story of Colonel Ben Willard(Sheen,looking every bit haggard and sickly),a mentally on-the-edge officer who is dispatched to eliminate'with extreme prejudice' a rogue officer named Kurtz(Marlon Brando,bloated,dazed and foreboding.More of a reflection of the persona he'd be remembered for now than he was pre-Godfather)is one that seems to be more focused on the violent nightmare that was Vietnam than the actual mission itself. Along the river(the Mekong?),Willard and his small crew(which included Frederic Forrest and an under-aged Laurence Fishburne!)encounter various traps and locals,all driving them slowly to wits end themselves. By the time Willard reaches his intended destination,most of his squad is decimated and what awaits is a primitive society of 'natives' who all nearly worship Kurtz,including a ranting photojournalist(a very memorable,and probably very tweeky,Dennis Hopper).This film is strictly visceral(as Coppola rightly intended),but it works brilliantly at it. I haven't seen much of the Redux version,but what I have seen tells me it seems to add to the emotional range of this film. With a small cameo from a then-unknown Harrison Ford(as a dispatch Intelligence officer)and a somewhat larger cameo by Robert Duvall(as a nearly mythical gunnery Sargent),this film's images,sound and economy of lines allows the viewer to get the same unpurgeable,acrid and vivid experience of the madness that can be found IN war(as opposed to the madness of it). A must see for any film fan!",10,0,1,27 November 2006
Disturbia," Red Herrings and David Morse...what more could you ask for?
","Troubled high school kid Kale(Shia LaBeouf,spelling?),already struggling with his father's death in accident that he survived and unable to connect to his equally agrieved mother(Carrie Anne Moss,probably the best looking mom on THAT block),then clocks his Spanish teacher and it lands him under arrest when the teacher presses charges. The condition of the arrest has him under house arrest,and his punishment becomes a fight with boredom. That fight becomes a practice in mostly harmless voyeurism that nets him two things: the improbable interest of the attractive new girl on the block(Sarah Roemer) and the realization that one of his other neighbors(David Morse)may be in fact a brutal serial killer. To anyone who has seen 'Rear Window'(or any other knock-off of Alfred Hitchcock movies will tell you),you kind of know where this story is going next.This show is,as per any Hitchcockian-type movie,possessing of no fewer than four 'Red Herings'(things that are thrown into a film to throw the viewer off the trail of what really is happening,who is doing what,or even misdirect as to the true source of menace)where KAle,Ashley(the girl) and doofy friend Ronnie(Aaron Yoo)find themselves tripping over to expose the true intentions of the otherwise quiet,reserved and perceivably friendly killer. If you can look past some of the implausibilities of the movie--examples being: how does a simple class three assault of a teacher amount to a house arrest with the potential for a felony upgrade or how a newly relocated would-be serial killer have the foresight and house space to relocate every single shred of evidence of their crimes?--and stay interested in the inevitabilities of the boy and girl getting together,it's quite possible(As it was for I)that you'll find this movie quite enthralling and even nerve-rattling. Director D.J.Caruso is able to effectively use space,movement and lots(and lots)of camera screens to enhance the visuals of this film,which is constricted to almost entirely the P.O.V. of the hero,Kale. Also,Morse as the would-be-scoundrel is VERY effective in a cool,calm,almost charming 'guy next door',countering and blunting just about every attempt Kale has of exposing him of who he really suspect him to be.A good,solid,satisfying rent that won't make anybody's 'Best of...' lists,if you can look past some rather pedestrian touches,you'll be drawn into to finding out just what is going on in this neighborhood.",7,0,1,19 August 2007
Dreamgirls," Everything you could want in a movie musical
","The film,as you may or may not be aware(as well as the stage musical upon which it is based)is considered a thinly-veiled and fictionalized account of the rise and break of the Supremes,the Motown super group consisting of three sequined and lovely songstresses. Crafted with enough sound and polish,this gives what it promises as a movie musical,even if it seems to bite off more than it can chew as a story. The events of this story spans about seventeen years(they never really divulge the year this show starts off,but I'm guessing it at about 1959 or 1960),and charts the difficult and meager beginnings of the Dreamettes(Anika Noni Rose,Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles),who are a promising trio but have little going for them except their dreams. When a slick,charismatic Cadillac salesman named Curtis Taylor(Jamie Foxx,modulating the charm as the Berry Gordy character)attaches himself to their careers,their luck slowly starts to turn. Along to help out is the brother(Keith Robinson)of the powerful and vulnerable songstress of the group Effie(Hudson,whose performance truly is the most raw and powerful of the show),who himself is a promising composer,whose ability to find hooks that can get their songs attention from a wider audience becomes an invaluable asset to the Dreamettes'(soon to be simply the Dreams)ambitions. They start off as back-up singers to one James'Thunder'EArly(Eddie Murphy,in probably his most complex performances of his career thus far!),a blustery,old-school blues howler who seems to be two parts JAmes Brown and one part MArvin Gaye or Jackie Wilson. He is a boozy,drug-addicted booze-hound who never let his marriage get in the way of getting' it on with any young songstress,and in this case,it's young,unspoiled Lorrell(Rose). Predictably,as Thunder's career plateaus and then comes down,the Dreams'career as a trio skyrocket. Of course,as their image becomes ubiquitous through the turbulent mid-sixties,changes are going to be made,as Curtis grooms fetching Deena(Knowles,holding her own if not exceptional)to be the star of the trio,while edging out the heart-sick and pregnant Effie,for whom Curtis had previous romanced and promised the world to.Fast-forward to the mid-seventies,and Deena's career(much like that of Diana Ross)is soaring behind a revamped Dreams lineup,and she's being prepped for a solo career and movies. Meanwhile,Effie is steadily picking up the pieces raising a child on her own and resolving to restart her singing career on her own. All parties involved before will reunite,but the turbulence getting there will test all parties involved. While this movie is rolling with the musical numbers and keeping the relationships crisp,this film sizzles with energy and vibrancy. When it drops to either social drama or personal interplay,the film kinda grinds down,not quite to a halt but certainly it loses momentum. I feel like Director and Co-writer Bill Condon isn't too sure if he wants this to be a musical with a message,or vice-versa,but either way it makes for captivating distraction. I credit the actors performances(particularly from Hudson and Murphy,although all are very fine)along with the music,editing and design teams(making three quite sexy songbirds not just pretty but GLAMOROUS,among other accomplishments),with giving this film a vivid and memorable identity. While this is worth a look in large or small screen,the big screen is truly recommended for the bigger,splashier look,since a movie musical really deserves the kind of treatment a larger stage can give it.",8,1,2,14 January 2007
In the Name of the Father," Themes of 'Terrorism' and 'draconian laws' resound loudly still
","This offering of a movie is very much an Irish/English story: the not-very-well known story(At least here in the States) of Gerry Conlon and the Guilford Four is mostly a tale of how a stupid,impetuous petty thief,Mr.Conlon(played with unrelenting energy from DAniel Day_lewis)is railroaded,along with his friends,his father(played with great dignity by Pete Postelthwaite) and about five others,into confessing complicity in a London pub bombing in the early-to-mid seventies. The focus is almost entirely on Gerry,as he at first accepts his fate as a criminal,languishing in a very hostile English prison, only to be slowly won over to fight for his innocence by his very upright father,who never gives up hope in winning an appeal of their conviction. Emma Thompson's part as the 'Four''s lawyer is not minor,but she really only comes into play more than halfway though the film.Still,she's as impassioned and stirring as ever.I use the title line of my review to say that even though the film's subject is very universal,it's themes are EERILY applicable to our war on terror in the USA. I feel like there's more than a little of this 'at all costs' approach to finding terror suspects.Politics aside,this was quite a strong movie,co-written by Terry George('Hotel Rwanda',another very strong film!) and directed by Jim Sheridan('My Left Foot'). I feel like,while this film may have special appeal to Irish Catholics anywhere(which I'm not quite one meself),I think it will work for the Irish(or non)in anyone.",8,1,3,1 June 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," An intelligent sex comedy
","A writer for THE PITCH(an independent Kansas City publication) wrote that,in the hands of somebody else, the eponymous character of this movie would be some sort of 'plastic freak' and would've been played for ridicule. Instead what we have here is a nice blending of ballsy sex comedy mixed with a genuine sweetness,an affinity for the title character whose struggles are as sympathetic as they are hilarious.Steve Carell,the co-writer as well as star of the show is Andy,a man who at forty seems okay with his life as a seemingly monastic bachelor,working at an electronics store. That all changes when his peers at work discover that their quiet but friendly coworker has never 'completed the deed'. When they decide to try and help him 'pop his cherry',they only end up getting him frustrated(and themselves in trouble). That is,until Andy meets a single mother(Catherine Keener),with whom he strikes up a warm,mildly sexual relationship. Since she is somewhat reticent about jumping back into sexual relationships,this naturally creates more conflict.Great performances and a smart script(also co-written by first time-director Judd Apatow) make this film above average for the 'gettin' some' themed movie. This film could've been so easily mucked-up by lesser talent. As is,this film has the somewhat rare ability to be crass,bawdy and yet gentle at the same time. A film worth seeing if you're tired of movies that act as if anybody who hasn't 'done it' as being abnormal. Funny and insightful.",9,1,3,30 October 2005
Jarhead," Think 'Full Metal Jacket' during the first Gulf War...
","...with much less actual killing.Anthony Swofford's memoirs of his time in the U.S.Marine Corps,mostly during the first Gulf War. This movie covers mostly the time between when he enlisted in 1989,through OPeration Desert Shield(August 1990 thru January 1991) and through the end of OPeration Desert Storm(March 1991).People going into this film expecting a war action film a la 'Black Hawk Down' or even 'We Were Soldiers...' are probably going to come away from this film feeling shafted. While this movie is set in the Corps and the brunt of the action occurs during a War(albeit,not quite an official one),this is NOT that kind of movie. Instead,it seems like a low-energy,Roman a Clef about military life as seen through the eyes of Cpl.Anthony 'Swoff' Swofford(Jake Gyllenhaal,who,if there was an official 'Hunk of the Year' title,would at least a finalist for it),as he goes from determined,idealist who joins the Marines to follow in his Vietnam vet dad's footsteps to a somewhat disillusioned adult who,along with his platoon,becomes ever-more frustrated in his lack of chances to kill anybody. INstead,the Corps duty seems to be an endless tedium of staying prepared and...waiting. As they wait for their turn to fight,Swoff and his mates try to keep their wits,with very tenuous results.I've read some of the threads on this site and I want to make something clear: I have no way of knowing how true Mr.Swofford's accounts are,and since I am not,nor ever was,a Marine,so I have to assume that his accounts are accurate. Also,I have not read the book(released in 2002,I think) that it is based on,so any claims that director Sam Mendes and co-writer William Broyles Jr. 'remade' the original work to fit into a movie that was in any way different from the original work could be quite true. What I do know(or believe) is that the elements of this film are very competently done,with particularly good turns by Gyllenhaal,Peter Skarsgard(as Swoff's platoon mate and steady hand Cpl.Troy)and Jamie Foxx(As the career Marine who is fully aware of the dangers and short-comings of his job,but couldn't be happier doing what he's doing all the same). This film is similar to 'Full Metal JAcket',not just because it is set in the Marines but also because there is plenty of wry humor and blunt treatment of military life. The difference between it and FMJ is mostly marked in the difference between Vietnam and the first Gulf War.This film seems to be a worthy watch for most,if not all,adult audiences. One will probably get a better appreciation of the movie if they go in looking for a story about the Marines themselves(as perceived through one of them)than about the work and duties they are charged with.",9,0,1,4 December 2005
The Machinist," Shades of 'Fight Club' blended with Hitchcockian mood
","Trevor Reznik(Christian Bale,starved and almost sickeningly fleshed-out)is the title character,a quiet,unassuming man who hasn't slept in a year,eats very little and has few(if any)friends. His only real relationships are with a good-humored hooker(Jennifer Jason-Leigh,perfect in this part.That sounds bad,I know)and a kindly waitress at an airport. His sense of reality seems to be taking a beating as he finds himself unable to explain his erratic behavior and his meeting a person who nobody else at work is aware of. While distracted on the job,he causes an accident that maims one of his coworkers(Michael Ironside,understated here),and from there,the film's pulse-beat really picks up.Actually,I'm trying hard not to give anything away here,but I feel like I am almost doing so anyway by my description of this film in the summary above. It is,however,tough for me to describe it WITHOUT drawing these comparisons. A quick parallel:both 'Fight Club' and 'MAchinist' have a main protagonist who is sleep-deprived and socially crippled,and both are having their lives slowly spiral out of control. Both also have a twist ending,too. The Hitchcock touches to me are mostly in the cinematography and music,which always hint toward something more sinister and dark on the horizon,even as the settings and events on the screen SEEM pretty ordinary. THis film is,on the whole,quite interesting and well-done,but a previous review summed it up well:this is NOT a movie for just anyone. In fact,it could be considered the definitive of an 'aquired taste',cineaste type of viewing,because the rhythm and images of this film are certainly unsettling. However,if you like moody,strange films with darker messages and a puzzle at its heart,go for this one.",8,1,1,4 December 2005
Ratatouille," As long as you're not completely averse to rats...
","..you'll be COMPLETELY enchanted with this.As such,you may still find this offering from PIXAR(and Disney),their eighth,to be quite a charming film.Remy(voice of Paton Oswalt)may be a rat,but he's a rat with a enhanced culinary sense. His sense of smell,taste and what-goes-with-what gives him a unique ability to appreciate and make food. It also,unfortunately,gets him and his colony(including his father and brother,voiced by Brian Dennehy and Peter Sohn)in trouble and gets them separated. He somehow ends up flushed down the sewage lines until he eventually ends up under the Four-star restaurant belonging to legendary Chef Gusteau(Brad Garrett,who could make a career on pretty much vocal work alone if he wanted),who was said to have died of a broken heart from a very harsh review from a joyless food critic scribe named Anton Ego(Peter O'Toole,adding to his already voluminous and impressive resume). It is there that Remy begins to make his mark(all in the name of survival,of course)by helping a hopelessly inept kitchen worker--'Garbage boy' is how he's generally described--named LInguini(Lou Romano),become the toast of the establishment(nay all of Paris)by turning him into a wiz chef,using Linguini as his artist brush(if you will)in creating art and beauty in cooking. Naturally,there is a fair amount of skepticism that arises over their newfound protégé,which is pretty much represented in all of the kitchen staff,particularly the scheming head chef Skinner(Ian Holm,unrecognizable)and,to a lesser degree,the attractive but somewhat prickly assistant chef named Colette(JAneane Garofolo,also unrecognizable!). The friendship and symbiotic relationship cultivated between Remy and Linguini is tenuous,of course,and what stands between Linguini being tossed and Remy out of food and shelter is always a revelation away. A plot twist has Linguini even more connected to the restaurant than he might initially appear.Written and directed by Brad Bird(the helmer for the over-ambitious but still largely entertaining 'The INcredibles'),this movie has a lot of burners going(pun only slightly intended)to put together this story,but for the most part,this movie works perfectly. The afore-mentioned plot twist involving Linguini seems somewhat superfluous,but it never really gets in the way of this story's charm.Maybe someday,PIXAR's exercises in eye-popping visuals and unique characters might hit a wall in terms of have both popularity and quality,but for now,it seems like the wizards of computer animation(who've since mended fences with Disney from a few years back)have another winner. You don't need kids to enjoy this one,but if you have 'em,they probably will. Bon apaetit and enjoy this tasty,lovable selection.",9,0,1,15 July 2007
Tropic Thunder," The phrase 'Ballsy' comes to mind
","For a film that's been bankrolled by Dreamworks(Spielberg,Katzenberg and Co.),this is about as sharp,incisive and unmericful a satire as you're gonna get from the film industry ABOUT the film industry.The whole product,to me,is really not as good as the parts,and the film actually seems to be a little TOO self-aware,which makes the comedy somewhat rough. But the riffing on film clichés and conventions,as well as the union of four Showbiz archetypes:the action her(Ben Stiller,also directing)who wants dearly and desperately to be taken seriously,the Award-winning Australian bad boy actor(Robert Downey Jr.,who,depending on your tolerance fro big bold character,will either be doing his most impressive or most annoying performance of his career here)whose form of 'mehtod' acting has now crossed into racist territory;the comedic actor(Jack Black,mocking his work or his peers?You be the judge)whose unbridled success has fed his worst demons to the point of implosion;the rap star(Brandon Jackson,maybe the coolest acting here),an ambitious kid with plenty of his product to hock and an image to protect;and the low-end,up-and-coming actor(Jay Bauschel),who clearly understands the craft,script,subject material(etc.)MUCH better than his much higher paid co-stars. They go off course of the Vietnam movie they're cast in and end up being the prey of Vietnamese Meth runners.Caught in this net are a juicy(and possibly most interesting)assortment of side characters featuring: a back-slapping Charlie of an agent(MAtthew McConaughey,does he EVER act?) for Stiller's action hero,the crippled lone survivor Vietnam Vet(Nick NOlte)who wrote the book and provides script material,the jacked-up Demolitons expert(Danny McBride,almost picking up where he left off in Pineapple Express)who almost worship's Nolte's character,the harried Brit director(Steve Coogan)who probably has no business directing this project and a callous Mo-Fo of a Studio exec(Tom Cruise,receiving no billing at all and darn near stealing this show!)who regards his stars and filmmakers the way many people regard toilet paper.As alluded to before,this is hardly a perfect movie,but it does have plenty of memorable lines and a savagery of the film industry that it so richly deserves. The unmitigated chutzpah of this film(it seems to have utter contempt for practically ALL of its characters)makes this alone worth catching. Worth a look,though one better know EXACTLY what they're getting into before seeing it,big screen or small.",8,1,2,30 October 2008
Independence Day," More fun than War of the Worlds
","While the 2005 WoTW probably is a much more artistic and carefully made 'Aliens blow up the world!' summer blockbuster,ID4 is much more fun.When ominously large,round alien ships enter the atmosphere,the wonder and awe of meeting extraterrestrial life that Earth experiences quickly fades into abject terror as the ships proceed to obliterate anything and anyone in their path. An ensemble of plucky heroes,most notably a computer technician and chess enthusiast(Jeff Goldblum),a tough and streetwise Marine pilot(Will Smith),his stripper girlfriend(the luscious Viveca A. Fox)with her son and dog in tow,a crazed vet working as a crop-duster(Randy Quaid,stealing EVERY scene he's in)and,of course,the President(Bill Pullman,butched and brooding,as contrasted to his whacked-out turn in the previous 'Mr.Wrong')who has the task of being both a father and inspirational leader at this time.The plot points are firmly in place,the lines are spit out like professional writers made them(as if!),and there's expositions aplenty. Throw in a tie-in to Area 51 paranoia and some stock side characters(a fried scientist played by Brent Spiner,the put-upon kids of Quaid's character,a tightly-wound General played by Robert Loggia,the President's cute-as-a-button daughter and his doomed first lady, played by an underused MAry McDonnell,Judd Hirsch as Goldblum's character's kvetching dad,etc.)and you've got an instantly accessible hit. And yet,despite the sense of eye-rolling predictability about this film,it still is a fun ride! The action moves at such a fluid pace that it doesn't allow you the viewer to dwell too deeply on the light characters or the overly jingoistic sentiment.People who saw this on the big screen probably got the added bonus of being able to experience the audio intensity of the film's sound editing that you probably won't get from seeing it on video or TV. DVD might give you SOME of that effect,but unless you have a home theater system with surround sound,I kinda doubt it.",6,1,2,27 July 2005
No Country for Old Men," Shades of 'Fargo',set in the vast,dry plains of South Texas
","The Coen Brothers' 1996 not-so-cult movie I just mentioned may not be a direct comparison(though,as I recall from just seeing it,it isn't TOO far from being one,to be honest)to this current offering from them.PArt-time big game hunter Llwelyn Moss(JOsh Brolin,bruising and bleeding away his cleaner,sexier image here)runs across a prairie filed where a drug deal has gone violently wrong and left what appears to be no survivors. Among the carnage there,he spots a briefcase loaded with $2 Million. Letting greed get the best of his better instincts,Llwelyn takes the case and makes with it,much to the chagrin of the angry drug lords who once possessed it and of particular interest to one Anton Shigurh(Javier Bardem,a vision of steady concentration and nightmarish violence and efficiency),a hired killer who seems to have gone completely rogue. On the trail of both are two completely different agendas: hired 'fixer' Carson Wells(Woody Harrelson,in his most succinct performance in recent history)and local Sheriff Ed Tom Bell(Tommy Lee Jones,who should ready himself for another onslaught of major award noms,if not outright awards for this performance),an aging,world weary lawman with more sense than to chase this case,but too much guts to let it go. As Shigurh carves a violent swath of destruction through south Texas into Mexico,it becomes increasingly evident that the clean escape that Moss had planned with the money is becoming almost impossible and a much higher debt to pay than what's contained in the purloined case he's been keeping.With heart-breaking performances by Kelly MacDonald(as the confused and powerless wife of Llewelyn),Tess HArper and Beth Grant(As,respectively,the warm and caring but ultimately unable to help wife of the Sheriff and Llwelyn's opinionated and feisty mother-in-law)and a dialog and soundtrack that is spare yet hauntingly effective,this movie makes the very choice move of making sure that little or no backing sound highlights or underscores the violence(and there's plenty of it)that this movie provides. Off the top of my head,the main comparison that this movie has to Fargo is that in both,a less-than-physically agile but very sharp and incorruptible law enforcement officer(here,Jones,in FArgo,Frances McDormand)tracks vile,potentially vicious thugs(here,of course,Bardem;there,Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare)through a state that is full of rural,potentially unforgiving terrain(FArgo's Minnesota and North DAkota to Old Men's Texas). Adapted off Cormac McCArthy's best-seller,the Coen's have seemed to rediscover their ability to contract their more scattered,frenetic,tongue-in-cheek natural style(think Raising Arizona,The Hudsucker Proxy,The Big Lebowski and,to a lesser degree,Barton Fink)and brought it down to something almost poetic and hypnotic(think MIller's Crossing,a film I personally found lushly made but irritating and hard to engage in). This movie disturbs as well as it entertains,but I have a strong feeling that was the aim of the makers,and as such,they hit their target(no pun intended).",10,3,10,15 December 2007
Batman Begins," Feeling better about the franchise
","While MY choice to direct the next batch of Dark Knight movies would've been David Fincher('Seven','FIght Club' in case you were not aware),Christopher Nolan does a striking job as the helmsman for this return to the genre abandoned after the ostentatious Joel Schumacher offerings from the mid to late 1990s.The story of BAtman is pretty understood by now. Here is mostly details. Orphaned Bruce Wayne(still youthful actor Christian Bale,excellent par usual) recalls his boyhood love and adulation of his family,particularly his philanthropic doctor of a father(Linus Roache,who seems to show up everywhere these days),his subsequent trauma and powerlessness of witnessing there murders and his inability to either defend or avenge them. The details of his transformation into the dual Wayne?Batman character are explored in more depth here. From a self-destructive journey of self-destruction through maximum security prisons to his being mentored by the 'League of Shadows' to his reclamation of Wayne enterprises and careful crafting of a crime-fighter who 'would make evildoers as afraid of him as he was of them'(I'm paraphrasing).Superb performances by Morgan Freeman,as a gizmo expert who Wayne chums with on the sly,Michael Caine as Alfred,who has to assume monumental parental qualities of MAster Bruce and BAle himself,who did some extreme beefing from his turn in 'The MAchinist'. I enjoyed this movie immensely,and while it may've lacked the fun or style of the Tim Burton's first 'Batman' this still satisfies greatly.",9,0,1,7 October 2005
Meet the Fockers," You've met the Byrnes...
","...now Meet the Fockers! Four years after the wildly successful Meet the PArents,the whole gang is back as Nurse Greg Focker(Ben Stiller,ready for more abuse as always),his girlfriend/fiancée PAm Byrnes(Teri Polo,not asked to do much in this one but be attractive and sweet),her parents JAck and Dina Byrnes(Robert DeNiro,full-tilt psycho and Blythe Danner,cool and humane,the perfect counterbalance!)and the dog,Jinxie. To complete the cycle of getting acquainted,Pam and her folks agree to travel down to Florida to meet Greg's family(hence the title,duh!). And as conservative and prim as the Byrnes' seem to be,Bernie and Roz Focker(Dustin Hoffman,hilarious and unchained,something he doesn't seem to get a lot of opportunities to be and Barbra Streissand,kvetchy and overpowering as usual)are every bit as liberal and exuberant to measure.The story-lines that ensue from there are basically one more long descent into personal hell for Greg,who discovers horrors ranging from his parents' unrestrained pride in their son(to point of painful,as seen in their keeping of everything of Greg's,ranging from every medal or ribbon he's won to his foreskin!)to the possibility that he may've sired a child with the saucy Latin nanny he lost his virginity to many years before. As per the first movie,where the pratfalls and gags seem to get larger as the show goes on,this one has the usual ante-upping. To tell you more might give it away,so I won't. Suffice it to say,Greg Focker won't be the only one to get bruised this time.Hardly a great movie,this show demands one principal trait here: a patience with--if not outright love of--Ben Stiller. I generally like his work(though he COULD stand to say no to a script or two),so this film does me just fine. The over-reliance on saying 'Focker' and plenty of the usual gross-out humor is going to try many audience's patience,but those who can roll with this film will do such peachy. Director Jay Roach,who obviously has no qualm with broad comedy,has the right players(including Tim Blake Nelson in a cameo)to work this kind of genre. Personally,I'd recommend it,if for nothing else some truly dumb laughs. A good compliment to the original.",7,0,0,2 April 2006
Before Sunset," Reunited and it DOES feel so good
","In 1995,director Richard Linklater introduced movie audiences to Jesse(Ethan Hawke)and Celine(Julie Delpy),two strangers from America and France(respectively)who meet on a train,stop in Vienna,drift through the lovely,historic streets and architecture as they converse,bond and,ultimately connect,only to part ways,unsure(as was the viewers)as to whether they would ever see each other again.Almost ten years later,Linklater,along with Delpy and Hawke,decided to continue the stories in real time,and this time an impromptu(and the script and story gives the viewer the right to doubt that)meeting during a book tour that Jesse is a part of to promote a novel he's written(regarding the fictionalized encounter he and Celine had)that stops in Paris,which just happens to be the home of Celine. They are elated to see each other at first,and then for the next(almost)two hours,proceed to take their conversation across the city. The mood changes in waves,as each examines their lives since their encounter and come to various philosophical realizations(or even un-realizations). Once again,as they both long for each other despite practically everything(i.e. he's married with a son,she's afraid of deep,ever-present relationships),and their closeness over this second bonding opens the door for perhaps another chance at romance that was kindled--and was extinguished just as quickly--and once again,you the viewer are left wondering: will they do it? Will it take this time? The possibilities.I was very pleased to see these character brought back. I was very impressed with the first movie,which I saw for free as part of a studio promo when I was in college,and felt after I saw it that this merited another look-see. A script penned by Hawke,Delpy,Linklater and Kim Krizan is written and rehearsed with such sharpness that,like the first firm,the feel of the conversation is relaxed and almost improvised in feel. Thes characters have grown up--in fact,in some ways,it feels like they've grown up possibly TOO much--but they still hold their memories and feelings with some of the same passion they had when they were twenty-somethings. Being of nearly the same age,I feel like this was the closest of just about any movie I saw out of the 90s that had ANY relation to my generation IMHO. This was not a widely released,nor wildly popular movie and that surprises me none.This is,like the last one,a purely conversational film and many people just simply have the patience for a film like that. I had been somewhat lazy about getting around to see this(on DVD,no less!)and maybe that came from subconsciously was afraid that a follow-up to the first movie might blow some of my theories or desires for the characters would not get realized or abused. I am happy to say after seeing this that none of that really happened. If anything,it actually carried along these characters in a natural arc that made them even MORE likable and real to me than previous.Personally,I'd love to see an Act III of Jesse and Celine,maybe this time in the states. And like before,there should be no rush,since these characters had plenty of time to develop for a largely satisfying Act II.",10,1,1,31 July 2007
The Princess Bride," As You Wish
","This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time! THe thing is,I saw this in the theater almost eighteen years ago and at the time,while I enjoyed it a lot,I didn't realize what kind of special movie it was until I'd watch it again years later.To me,what marks this film as special is the fact that it dares to make the simple method of storytelling as the crux to the film. Even though the movie is,on face value,a tale of the love between Princes Butercup(Robin Wright,now Penn)and her servant boy Westley(Cary Elwes,whose career since seems to be underusing his talents),it's also many things:a caper,a comedy,a uniquely created characters,a drama,a morality tale and a love story that isn't as clichéd as it might appear. It's unapologetically anachronistic and yet still seemingly true to the sword-and-sorcerer fairy tale genre.It's also the underlying tale of the ability for the bond between a grandfather(the always solid Peter Falk) and grandson(Fred Savage,pre-'Wonder Years')to supercede a contemporary kid's need for all the comforts and instant gratification kids tend to expect anymore.BAsically,this is a well crafted weaving of two stories to fit one movie. Very strong supporting roles from Billy Crystal,Andre the Giant,Mandy Patinkin,Christopher Guest,CArol Kane,Wallace Shawn and Chris Sarandon also flesh this story out effectively.It makes me sad that Rob Reiner doesn't seem to think he needs to direct anything even remotely like this film anymore.Mark KNopfler's score is absolutely beautiful,too.I could try to say more to tell you why I think this is such a great film,but you'll just have to see this yourself to get the idea.",10,2,3,8 May 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Gets a reaction out of me every time I see it(and I'm certain I'm NOT alone)
","Now I cannot speak from any sort of personal experience,not militarily nor age-wise(my late maternal grandfather actually was in the European theater of command during WWII,and missed being involved in D-day by not that much,if I'm to understand correctly),so I would and could not dispense with any of the critiques that I've read here regarding how true or authentic the military/war element of the film was(and there were about equal parts of both those who thought this show was the best/very accurate and those who thought this wasn't even close/completely inaccurate,from what I was able to divine off the long rolls of comments). So I can only review this the way someone in my position can:namely,from how it directly affected me.And for that,this film is completely and totally spot-on.The possibly fictionalized account of an Army expeditionary unit's dispatch to find the lone surviving brother of five servicemen who were killed in action because of an obscure rule in the military that pertains to surviving siblings during war. The unit is led by quiet,dignified schoolteacher Captain John Miller(Tom Hanks,who really is a study in steady perseverance here)and the troops are predominantly young(i.e. 19 to 27 year old men)and prone to the usual emotional swings that occur amongst young men who are both brave but bewildered,uncertain of the mission and colored by their own personas.To say that this movie is manipulative would be an understatement,but then,how else does director Steven Spielberg roll? From the highly personal camera-work,simple yet emotive dialog and--last but not least--the grinding,crunching,raw,explosive sound,visual and special effects(and the editing that went with it!),this movie will most certainly draw a reaction out of you the viewer,whether positive(largely what I felt)or negative. To me,if a movie cannot be able to elicit a reaction,physical,emotional or both,then it really cannot be considered a potent film. Conversely,if it can create ANY reaction,then kudos to the makers. This film had me feeling a whole range of emotions through its run(much of it anger and low,grinding fear).I'm sure there are equal arguments as to the legitimacy of a military,historical or cultural film that Saving Private Ryan either is or isn't. Either way,this movie creates a powerful,raw and memorable feel that does not abate with watchings. Not a favorite,I suppose,but an excellent work of cinema. 9.5 out of 10",9,2,4,4 April 2009
28 Days Later...," An Existential Drama,with Horror woven in
","The 2003 State-side release of Danny Boyle's '28 Days Later' was advertised as being a shockful scare-fest of a movie. I didn't get around to seeing it until a few days ago and I gotta feel like that was somewhat of an embellishment on the promoters' part.When environmental terrorists attack a lab that contains diseased chimps who are infected with a 'Rage' virus, they unwittingly let loose a plague that lays waste to England and(perhaps)the rest of society. The 28 Days later of the title cuts to a mostly abandoned London where a coma-tized bicycle courier named Jim(Cillian Murphy,effective) wakes from his stasis to find himself alone in a hospital. As he searches London for signs of life,he is rescued from raging zombies by a couple of survivalists(one of them,the lovely Naomie Harris)who he follows from place to place to keep alive. From there,he also meets a man and his daughter(Brendan Gleeson,terrific,and Megan Burns,good)and they try to find a refuge out of London-town. A recorded message of a 'paradise' where 'salvation' can be found is tracked by Frank(the man) on his shortwave radio.This film feels more like a meditation on what happens to people when they are reduced to their lowest elements. A friend of mine told me that this movie's running zombies was what inspired the zombies in the remake of 'Dawn of the Dead',but where 'Dawn of...' was pretty much a full-throttle action/horror hybrid from about start to finish,this film plays more like a 'What if...' movie,with less emphasis on the creatures themselves and more on the (lucky?) survivors. There are also disturbing lessons on the nature OF survival,too.An very interesting and disturbing flick that probably sold itself wrong.",8,214,282,10 August 2005
The Incredibles," At the intersection of 'Animated family fare' and 'Grown-up entertainment'
","Pixar stepped it up for this movie,with the running time of this story of a family of superheroes closing ranks to out-duel some super evil forces,clocked in at just over two hours,which is quite the length for animation,computerized or no. Even though this film,to me,doesn't quite erase memories of better PIxar fare('The 'Toy Story'films,'Finding Nemo' or 'Monsters INc.')this is still a clever,smart,well-crafted film that all ages of the family can enjoy.Once scions of society,Superheroes everywhere became the target of obsolescence when lawsuits by rescue-es(And some villains)became too much for a heavily financially-strapped society,and they're forced underground. So goes for the Parr family:Bob(Mr.INcredible),Hlene(Elastigirl),kids Violet(Invisible girl),Dash(Speedster)and JAck JAck(the baby,with hence unknown powers),try to fit into society. But a dark,shady group knows their secrets and tries to smoke them and other former heroes out,which also includes Mr.INcredible's longtime pal and cohort Frozone.Using the voice talent of Criag T.Nelson(dad),Holly Hunter(mom),SArah Vowll(daughter) and SAmuel L.JAckson(Frozone),among others,director co-writer Brad Bird makes a movie that works on levels that appeal to adults AND kids. It sits,to me,right smack-dab in the middle of Pixar offerings,which would still be better than many animated films.",8,0,0,24 November 2007
School of Rock," In a word: Unique
","Director Richard Linklater is no stranger to making odd,interesting and even delightful films. Slacker,Dazed and Confused,Before Sunrise are films that come to my mind in regards to films he's helmed that fit that category. This one ranks right up there,if not top them all.A boozy,unemployed,disbanded rock musician Dewey Finn(Jack Black,born to take command of a movie like this!)assumes his put-upon roomy Ned's identity and takes a job as a substitute teacher at a prep school and decides,in order to cover up his lack of credentials,to teach what he knows,and what he knows is rock 'n roll. Little by little,he gets the kids,who are all to a one bright and to varying degrees bored or under-inspired,to get in on a class project to form a rock band and take part in a 'Battle of the BAnds' contest,to which Dewey desperately wants to break through.A whole cast of kids(for whom I will not name each,since there are so many and I am,well...lazy)play their roles not cute or to mug for the camera,playing themselves honestly and,to my thinking,maybe the best element of this already finely crafted show. And that's to take nothing away from the adults here,particularly Black,Mike White(as Dewey's put-upon roomy and one-time band-mate Ned),SArah Silverman(as Ned's shrewish girlfriend)and Joan Cusack(priceless as the repressed fuddy-dudy who runs the school). There aren't,I'd estimate,that many films out there like this one:namely,a smart movie that deals in current themes and consists of kids. My suggestion:check this film out and find out for yourself.",10,1,1,27 May 2007
Ghostbusters," If You Can Catch This One on the Big screen...DO!
","To be sure,this film is a modern comedy classic no mater what medium you see see it on. BUt my first viewing of this was on the big screen,and it was breathtaking! Perhaps the memories of my youth have dolled this experience up,but I still feel like you get the full effect of the special effects and music of this picture when you see it on large screen. I was twelve when 'Ghostbusters' stormed through theaters,breaking box office records for a comedy,and if I didn't already have some sense of admiration for the comedic talents of Bill Murray,Dan Aykroyd,Harold Ramis and Rick Moranis before this movie,I would after.In case you are not familiar with the story,here goes: Three paranormal professors(Murray,Aykroyd and Ramis) are kicked out of their cushy,tenured jobs at a prestigious New York college(NYU?) and decide to go into business as paranormal investigators and erstwhile ghost hunters. They always seem to be close to but never quite able to capture,evidence of the supernatural around New York. That changes when they become the successful,'last avenue' answer to corralling a rather nasty ghoul who is creating havoc in a swanky four-star hotel(The Waldorf?). This leads to a string of successful 'Ghost busting' all over the region, and it leads them back into the life of one concert musician(Sigourney Weaver,in her first chance to flex her comedic muscle)who happens to be siting on top of a particularly awesome din of supernatural activity on the loom. Rick Moranis steals his scenes as the dweeby accountant neighbor of Weaver's,and Ernie Hudson joins on near the end as a no-nonsense guy who believes in the Ghostbusters' mission,in spite of his better instincts. Rounding out the cast are Annie Potts(pre-Designing Women)as the dryly unenthused secretary and William Atherton as the weasly EPA rep and ostensible villain here(an 80s era dig). Director Ivan Reitman,while somewhat of an inconsistent filmmaker('Stripes','Twins','DAve' and 'Junior'),is very deft and clever in balancing effects and eye-candy with comedy,keeping the film both light AND powerful. I realize that films that have been around as long as 'Ghostbusters'(which will turn twenty-one this June,if you're counting) rarely get to see the insides of movie theaters anymore,but if by some chance you're at a movie festival or college campus that is showing this on the large screen,I highly recommend you go catch it!",10,0,0,8 May 2005
Gran Torino," Calling this 'Typical Eastwood' would be a compliment
","Grizzled Korean WAr vet Walt Kowalski(Clint Eastwood,still vital and virile at 78!)was always a hardened,angry and racist man. Losing his devoutly Catholic wife of many years and watching much of anything and anyone he's known change,move away or die has made him even harder. There are really only three things that this old guy treasures:his routines,his property and his vintage 1972 Gran Torino. So when the Hmong boy next door(Bee Vang,limited,but that might be due to lack of experience and shyness)tries to lift Walt's prized car as part of a gang initiation,it sets into motion a series of events that defies much of what the old guy believes and forces a re-evaluation of his life.Starring in and directing this film,Eastwood uses a lot--and I mean A LOT--of his standard manqué(post-Dirty Harry,of course):plain,simple characters in deep,moral and existential struggles,coupled with a less-than-rosy view of violence. Throw in a plot twist here or there,spare music score during the film,framed at the ends with mellow(not smooth,there's a difference)jazz. Much or even all of these elements have been components of his films of late. And as such,they are perfectly good things in my humble opinion. They are par for the course here,and while the acting in this movie is truly not that remarkable--though Ahney Her as the Hmong boy's older sister is at least likable--the story and Clint's forceful presence makes this movie funny,human and intriguing. Actually,in a word or attempt at fairness to the rest of the cast:I suspect that Clint and the producers probably were AIMING for the large majority of the cast of this film to be as UN-actor-like as possible,to give this a much more plain,simple and realistic(though I've read enough posters who would disagree heartily with that last part)feel. At this writing,the Academy Awards were just announced,and I'm genuinely surprised that this movie has not garnered a single nomination. Not writing.Not directing.Not acting(mostly for Clint).Not editing. Not sound. Nothing. While this may not be the best Mr.Eastwood has developed in his long and storied career(though it's light years away from being the weakest),this sure SEEMED like it would garner some considerations(I didn't see the Golden Globes,but I don't recall it getting any mention there either). I guess 'seemed' would be the the operative word here.",9,1,5,22 January 2009
Back to the Future Part III," Felt like I was seeing it for the first time...again
","The other day I watched this film for what has to be AT LEAST the fourth time,but probably for the first time in eight years. Even though I knew how it went,had a pretty good idea of the sequence of events and even some of the jokes,watching it again(this time on premium cable)still gave me a flood of emotions that one usually gets from watching a movie the first time,only this time with the sentimental melancholy of the knowledge of real time passing. Strangely,that might have actually ENHANCED my experience with this.Originally meant as the end part of 'Back to the Future,Part II',but broken off because when director Robert Zemekis,producers Steven Spielberg and Bob Gale realized that they had too much movie in the can to put out as one release,they split this series off into its own film(a fact that I've become a little skeptical of over the years since). Number Three's actually a little bit better than the over-stuffed,over-ambitious 2nd part of the McFly Time travel saga,since the use of anachronistic time-displacement of both Marty(Michael J.Fox) and Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)--in this case the Old West of 1885 rural California,seems to be closer to the true spirit of the 1985 blockbuster original. All the usual elements are in place from the previous movies(particularly the bullying element,supplied by the always capable Thopmas F.Wilson,this time as Bad Biff's ancestor,Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen),and an added love interest for the normally reclusive Doc in the form of a delicate librarian named Clara(Mary Steenburgen),all moves seamlessly enough. One may question the specifics of this film,as per any of the series(or any time travel movie in general),but one who gives in to the charm,humor and kinetics of this Zemekis-Spielberg creation will not be disappointed. Aided by the always huge,welling music score of John Williams,this movie closes the story of time travel fixing(and un-fixing)the lives of the two principles of this story.I watch any of these three movies with some sense of sentimentality and bittersweet. This one in particular,makes me feel both entertained and yet sad. This really WAS a concluding sequel,and with the star players getting older(particularly Fox,who himself was already twenty-eight when filming this movie and was done with playing the kind of clean teen roles he'd been famous to up to that point)and such a memory attached to the players involved,there was no right way to either continue the series with OR without them.I seem to recall a short-lived animated series was created that was easily forgotten. Maybe someday in the future,someone will want to remake this again and be able to do it without stepping on the toes of those(like myself)who enjoyed the originals as greatly as we did. I have my doubts anyone can,but who knows.But as for seeing Marty,Doc Brown and a certain DeLorean fight off both Tannen and his thugs and righting some serious time travel blunders,this is still a glorious viewing experience that can make you feel young again. Being someone who recalls movie viewing in theatres(occasionally on video)from his youth with nearly photographic clarity,I can honestly say that watching this again I couldn't recall much about the experience around this movie,but I do recall how good this film made me feel specifically. How many films can you say that about?",Null,0,0,11 May 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Curious Indeed
","I first saw the trailer for this some months ago and,without knowing much more about this other than the fact that Brad Pitt was playing a man who was aging backward(that and the fact that the trailer curiously DIDN'T have a studio identification mark at the beginning of it),I found myself,ahem,intrigued. Curious,if you will.Months later,and with the critical and overall audience positive vibe,I decided I'd invest in this. An entertainment reporter on NBC,shortly before the Golden Globes,referred to this movie as a 'Romantic film',but I think that description is a little more than a tad oversimplified. This is a grand,sci-fi/fantasy/adventure/romance/tall tale that only really suffers from its own ambition.The movie's plot is really not secret,so I'll instead reveal some differences from the Scott Rudin-Robin Swicord penned screenplay and the original F.Scott Fitzgerald short story: Benjamin(Pitt,as much a credit to this role as the brilliant make-up job done to show the progression,or rather de-progression,of time)is in the movie born at the end of World War I(November,1918),whereas in the story he is born a year before the American Civil War(1860); he is born to rich MAryland or Virginia natives in the story,whereas he is clearly a product of a mixed relationship marriage in New Orleans;and while the lady love of his life is a bright,talented dancer named Daisy(Cate Blanchett,ages beautifully,inside and out)in a clear allusion to the one of the more remembered works by the famous author,her name is something more like Hildegard. Those things,added to the exquisite detail and artistic embellishment of director David Fincher,make this movie is a vision. While I was,I must confess,somewhat put off by the romantic elements of the movie,I could basically take it in stride as being something that overall enriches Benjamin's life story.The nearly three hour running time of CCoBB may put off perspective viewers of this movie(among other things),but it shouldn't. The narrative is so rich and fluid that it only feels like a lot of time running once you disengage in watching. If this show puts one in mind of other 'tall adventure' tales on the big screen like Forrest Gump or BIg Fish,that's no mistake:co-writer Rudin also penned Gump.A strong,if perhaps over-stuffed,offering to the large screen which is probably best viewed there.",8,0,2,15 January 2009
Garden State," Good downbeat film that's not perfect,but so what?
","HYper-depressed writer/actor Andrew Largeman(ZAck Braff,writer and director here)flies home from LA to New Jersey(hence the title)for his mother's funeral after she dies accidentally from a mishap that has a longer,attached story to his life. When he returns home,he finds that much of what he left behind didn't change all that radically,except that most of who he knows is older and somewhat more pathetic. To top that off,his therapist father(Ian Homl,perfect here)is even MORE of a cold,detached professional that he remembered. The return home seems to be a mere exercise of expectations than a true healing or revelation,save for the fact that he meets by chance a slightly unhinged free-spirit named Sam(NAtalie Portman,maybe a little TOO chipper and breezy for this).This film may lack energy,or have some internal logic weaknesses(Andrew's relationship,or lack thereof,with his family,starting with his mother seems to be somewhat sloppily explained),but there seems to be an almost matter-of-fact,laid-back sense of dark comedy that makes this film refreshingly different from cookie-cutter type action/comedy/thriller/whatever. The film seems to be more interested in letting the viewer 'breathe in' the atmosphere of loneliness and detachment of the characters,particularly Andrew,for whom it seems both appropriate yet sad that he was so alienated by his own flesh-and-blood that he left them behind for the other coast and never really looked back for a whole decade. THis may be how comedy in films really SHOULD be more like:human,relaxed and not always pretty. Most of the acting is standard,neither great nor terrible,with the exceptions being Braff,Holm and Peter Skaarsgaard as a fairly depressed and slightly off former neighborhood and childhood friend. This would be another 'Palate-cleanser' movie for someone who';s renting or seeing a spate of large scale,intensity films(say, between viewings of a SAw movie and a POTC or LOTR film)and it's a nice debut for Scrubs' Braff.",8,1,2,29 January 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A Chapter of post- WWII America
","Director and co-star George Clooney's take on Edward R. Murrow's tilt with Senator Jospeh McCarthy is as understated as it is inspired. The red menace and the scare of the early fifties could've been played up for a more visceral tone but was instead,played in a sober,almost matter-of-fact manner. The usage of black and white filming also gave this some level of era authenticity.Strong,measured performances by David Straithairn(as Murrow,brilliant),Clooney,PAtricia Clarkson,Robert Downey jr.,Frank Langella,Jeff Daniels and Reed Diamond,stapled by a smooth jazz soundtrack creates a mood that is at once sober,chilling,and yet somehow reassuring and nostalgic. It is a telling chapter in America's history,vis-a-vis the Media and Government. Worth seeing for the student of American history,Government,free speech and the Cold War of any age.",10,3,5,20 January 2006
Dumb and Dumber," Pure,unadulterated comedy
","This movie is special to me for the simple fact that it makes no pretense that it is anything BUT a comedy. Loaded with sight gags,verbal humor,toilet humor,pratfalls,cross-ups,mix-ups and perfect timing,this film employs just about every level of film comedy and makes practically all of them work.The story is almost pedantic and non-essential:two hopelessly half-witted buddies,Harry and Lloyd(the very adept Jeff Daniels and the very comfortable-in-the genre Jim Carrey)agree to travel cross country to return the briefcase that a fare who Lloyd(a chauffeur) taxied to the airport 'lost' at the terminal. Of course,they are not aware that the briefcase was intended as a 'drop' for a hostage situation where the fare,a lovely redhead named MAry(perennial straight woman Lauren Holly),was to ransom her kidnapped husband. Naturally,Lloyd and Harry's meddling throws the hostage development into chaos,but not before the dim-witted duo get into various forms of trouble along the way. ONe should have a strong stomach while viewing this,as was the case with most pre-'Shallow Hal' Farrelly Brothers(who wrote and directed in tandem)films. Definitely a film one will either 'get' or 'not get',with almost no room in-between.",10,1,2,6 June 2005
The Evil Dead," A marvel what some college film students can do on a shoestring budget
","SPOILER(S) POSSIBLEThe first ever full-on film project by budding filmmakers Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert(then called Bobby Tapert)would prove to be a work of endurance and love and also one of the more entertaining horror films made in the eighties.The plot is painfully simple: Five young adults from Michigan drive off into the woods for a camping vacation,using a seldom-used cabin as their haunt. They uncover a tape recorder and a crusty,dusty and blood-and-flesh-coated 'Book of the Dead' or 'Necromonicon',inadvertently incant the chant that awakes a limitless supply of malevolent spirits in the woods,and then one by one get picked off until a lone survivor is left to fight to escape. The story isn't much of an accomplishment:it's the whole physical undertaking that's the real accomplishment.On a small budget that was probably getting smaller as the shoot continued(I don't know the exact amount of time of filming,but it probably lasted at least a year),the filmmakers and stars(all of 'em,most famously budding star Bruce Campbell as the conflicted but can-do Ash)had to make the most of a limited set,claustrophobic settings,gallons of viscous fluids,endless supplies of cakey make-up,a limited amount of lighting(probably NOT an accident,there) and probably a mass-produced amount of fog to create something that has both the feel of a creepily eerie film about the undead and yet had the effects to back up the type of slasher horror pic that the producers were aiming for.The first of an intriguing trio of horror/comedy films that Raimi,Tapert,Campbell and company would crank out over a period of just under fifteen years(and,after seeing this film in full,I'm not sure if anyone involved originally intended to make any sequels),the atmosphere and noticeably cheap effects may turn-off your pickier horror film snobs,but anyone with a sense of adventure and high tolerance for gore will be reasonably pleased--if not greatly impressed--by this first effort film. A keeper,not a renter,not only for repeated viewing but also for the extras.",9,24,31,31 October 2009
For Love of the Game," Allegorical tale of a athlete's career at it's last roar
","Eighteen-year veteran major league pitcher Billy Chapel(Kevin Coaster,big surprise)has played for--and only for--the Detroit Tigers. He is in the twilight of his career and facing the very real prospect of either being traded(something he is dead-set against)or forced retirement(something he wants to forestall as long as possible).His last start of the season is against the storied and hated New York Yankees in Yankee Stadium,and as he faces a hostile crowd and a formidable opponent,Billy proceeds to pitch the game of his life:namely,a perfect game(for non-baseball fans:no hits,no walks,no runners.Nada). With only his catcher and friend Gus(the always strong John C.Reilly)and his sturdy,grumpy manager(J.K.Simmons)as his confidants,he weathers this storm alone with his thoughts.His thoughts bring him to review his most recent relationship with a pretty divorcée(Kelly Preston)who doesn't follow baseball and her painfully normal daughter(Jena Malone). At this juncture,they're at a bit of a break,and there's no telling if they'll be a couple again.Directed by(of all people)horror/action movie wiz Sam Raimi,For Love of the Game teetered dangerously close to being a sappy love story OR a overly sentimental Baseball movie,but it manages to avoid either if but barely. The rhythm of this film impressed me the most:with each laborious inning of pitching,you the viewer are walked through the event as if you were out there on the mound with Costner's character. I've grown past weary with Costner's career over the fifteen-plus years since he won the Oscar for DAnces With Wolves,and whenever he tries to stretch past being the handsome jock-turned-hero-next door,it can be any degree of painful/laughable to watch(try Waterworld,The War or Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves for examples). But here,he's perfect as the beaten but proud athlete,and the parallels between his game,his career,and his life in general(particularly his love life)are well plotted,which may be as much a credit to screenwriter Dana Stevens and(in part)the novel by Michael Sharaa as it is the actors and directors.This movie requires some patience,but when given,this will more than likely draw the viewer in.",8,0,1,9 January 2007
Big Fish," Making tall tales out of reality
","My faith in this movie was paid off threefold as I gambled on yet another Tim Burton. After being jarred(albeit effectively) by 'Sleepy Hollow' and utterly confused and a little angry from 'Planet of the Apes',I could've just let this one slide. But I thought I'd give this one a chance,if for nothing else,the fanciful storyline and the adept casting.The story segues back and forth between young Edward Bloom(Ewan MacGreggor,cleaned up and un-Scottish here) and old Edward Bloom(Albert Finney,Academy snubbed here IMHO). Bloom is a legend to just about everybody,including himself,not least of which is because he can tell a great story. One of the very few to cut him much slack and is mostly distrustful of his persona is his son,William(Billy Crudup,understated,as usual). Bloom's wife Sandra(a non-aging Jessica Lange,saintly this time)has to straddle the line between being a loving,adoring wife and the hand of reality to her progressively fanciful and bombastic husband. Bloom tells tales about growing up in rural Alabama(wouldn't you KNOW that a film about tall-tales would be set in the South!),and his travails over a period of just over thirty some odd years. This film reminds one of 'Forrest Gump' on at least a few levels:one,the larger-than-life recollections of a Southerner,set over the course of the middle twentieth century America and two,the protagonist's belief in true and abiding love. But while Gump sometimes threatened to sicken the audience with its heavy-handed pleasant,painfully simple truisms,'Fish' is smarter in that it sticks with pure story-telling with the trust that the audience will 'get' the differences between storied past and dull reality,allowing them to appreciate the wonder rather than get possibly bludgeoned by it. Rather than trying to merely stick a fictional figure in historic situations(a la 'Zelig'),the writers and Burton wisely chose to develop an almost 'Gulliver's Travels' type of path. Last but not least,one watching this film cannot forget to complement the choice to film the past and present in different lights:the past as bright and dreamy,full of vibrant colors and music;the present as drab,earth-toned reality.(BTW,this doesn't mean I didn't like 'Forrest Gump'. I did,but I appreciate it in a different way.) Some strong turns by a supporting cast featuring Steve BUscemi(always good!),Robert Guillame,Danny DeVito and Helena Bonham Carter. I cannot,for the moment,recall who played the Giant Ed Bloom befriends,but he is very effective,both as an awesome and sympathetic character.Emotionally-based films of fancy can be tricky to keep both convincing AND authentic,but Tim Burton seems at home in this original and beautifully done movie.",10,0,0,3 July 2005
The Dark Knight," Ambition pays off {{Spoilers??}}
","The build-up,hype and expectations from both critics and fans over the follow-up film to the agreeably successful Batman Begins from 2005 was so large that one could conceive of the possibility that this could crash beneath those expectations as easily as it could success.Luckily,for both it and the public,it really didn't.Save the(one might say)bloated running time and somewhat UN-fun deeper themes(i.e. human nature,the nature of evil,the moral conundrums of vigilantism,the expectations on law enforcement,etc.)that get maybe more exploration than one would necessarily warrant out of a summer film,this follow-up is everything one could ask for out of BOTH a summer action film and the Batman canon.Practically all of the front line cast--with the noticeable exception of KAtie Holmes--has returned from three years back, augmented by Maggie Gyllenhaal(picking up for Holmes as ADA Rachel Dawes),Aaron Eckhart(as hotshot prosecutor Harvey Dent)and,of course,the now late Heath Ledger as the Joker. Joker is,as per the true BAtman series,a completely enigmatic character--almost a NON-entity,really--who swoops into Gotham proposing to bring down Bats. His attacks on the organized criminal element of Gotham prove to be highly effective in both galvanizing the cops and the mob in their attempts to break through the DArk Knight. As this is going,Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale)contemplates a world without his crime-busting alter ego,but the previously stated conflagration will make sure that that doesn't happen.Christopher Nolan has truly adapted his lens for the BAtman story,and his choices of scenery,lighting,angles and stunts have pretty close to wiped out all memory of a Joel Schumacher-painted Batman(And for that matter,truly altered the heavy-monochromatic schemes of Tim Burton's films). Cinematogrpaher and long-time contributor Wally Pfister gets some of the credit for that. The acting is solid,top to bottom,and even though Ledger gets the most attention here(well-merited attention),pretty much all of the principles(and even a few of the minor parts)are also quite strong. Eckhardt's stretch is athletic going from super cop/prosecutor to a darker ethos,and Gyllenhaal's RAchel is beautiful and brave,and seems more age-appropriate for her role.It takes some ability(and chutzpah)to make a 'Big' Hollywood,summer blockbuster film founded on a super popular comic,making this accomplishment a marvel to behold. Any film sequel that can make you truly LOOK FORWARD to another sequel HAS to be worth the price of admission and concessions!",9,3,8,27 July 2008
Into the Wild," Must be seen--no,experienced-- to be believed
","I was already pretty well aware of this film from last fall,the story(or the broad outline of it anyway) of Christopher McCandless,the University graduate from a fairly well-to-do family who chucks his fortune and material goods to go up into rural Alaska,directed by Sean Penn and adapted off the book by JOn Krackhauer(spelling?). I was,initially,not sure how much I wanted to see this,but as time passed and heard more reviews and reactions,I became pretty certain that I wanted to see it,and after somewhat of a wait,I was finally able to.I preface all of this because while seeing this,I was still awestruck,caught by things I'm not sure I was even prepared for. McCandless(Emile Hirsch,in a profound performance that is both physical AND mental) spends the better part of(actually,I think it WAS) two years after graduating Emory University in Atlanta chucking his educational money and possessions to live a more 'authentic' and 'truthful' life,based at least in part on the book he's read (much of it THoreau,Tolstoy,Emerson,Lord Byron and Dostoyevsky). Through much of the two-and-three-quarters hours running time,we go on the journey in somewhat non-linear fashion, with reflections on both the journey itself and the narration of McCandless' loyal and heartbroken sister(Jena Malone,who was possibly my favorite element of this film). What we get is both a visual exploration of the wilds of Western America and Mexico and a bit of a meditation on personal desires and ambitions,be they foolish,noble or (quite possibly) both.Supporting turns by Hal Holbrook (as the elderly loner who sees in McCandless--now known as Alex Supertramp--as the grandson he always wanted), CAtherine Keener (as the good-natured hippie who secretly pains for Chris/Alex's parents and family), Brian Dierker(as Keener's similar husband), Vince Vaughn (as the good-natured farmer who befriends Chris/Alex as he employs him),Kristen Stewart (as the hippie child who fancies him), Marcia Gay Harden (somewhat subdued as Chris' mother) and William Hurt (slightly bolder as Chris' materialistic father) truly set the tone for the story. Sean Penn's direction may even be a little heavy-handed for him (I personally liked his touches on 'The Crossing Guard' or 'The Pledge' better), but it still is made with a scope that makes the story full,beautiful,tragic and even poetic.I noticed,through flipping through some reviews and message posts on it's IMDb site,that this film has encouraged about as many negative reactions as positive,mostly couched in the complaint that McCandless is portrayed as a beatific,almost religious character,a tragic hero that is fully realized. I would say that,while I can get where some people would feel that,I am of a mind that McCandless(certainly through the book,and possibly through the film,even if by accident) is actually a somewhat complex character: at once sympathetic and noble,yet painfully selfish and thoughtlessly cruel. He is both incredibly bright and yet a big enough fool to orchestrate his own demise. I may come to feel some affinity for the character(and I did) but I also realize that he was not hardly a flawless person. I suspect that anyone who sees this film may be the most satisfied by the movie if they can make this balance.Anchored by haunting music composed by Michael Brook,Kaki GAutier and Eddie Vedder(who lends his voice to it as well) and breathtaking cinematography by Eddie Gautter,this movie is well worth a look,because descriptions cannot quite do this justice on their own.",9,0,1,19 February 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Another big screen marvel,utterly lost on small screen
","I have always appreciated the visual marvels of this movie. The images are powerful and lasting,and the usage of classical music to add awe to the effects of mankind's venture into space was a very smart decision on the part of Stanley Kubrick and the editors of the film. HAving said that,I can think of far more engaging stories that have been committed to celluloid.The film,an adaptation of Arthur C.Clarke's 1963 bestseller,is probably best summed as a study in contrasts: the first,a dry look at the beginnings of man on Earth,learning to tame nature and each other,the second,mankind's utilization of technology and it's betray of man. The problems to me with this film are probably as much its most distinctive traits: namely,the pacing is glacially slow,there is precious little dialog and the visual image effects are drawn out to the point of tedium. If you are straining your ears for some sort of plot resolution or denouement from the characters involved,or seeking a central point of focus in this movie,you will be sorely disappointed. Having said that,this film is far better viewed on a large screen or an IMAX,because this film's qualities seem to befit a medium that allows for a sense of awe or wonder. Seeing this on a small screen broadcast or on VHS almost completely dilutes the experience. To true film fans,this film is AT LEAST worth a look or two. But I'd be lying if I said that this film was a very ingratiating film view",7,3,6,12 February 2006
Toy Story," Can it be ten years already?
","PIXAR animation was but an experimental animation company that had a track record of short film contributions to film festivals when Disney invested in and ultimately released their first project,Toy Story. I figured Disney probably had a good feeling about this one,but I'm not sure they anticipated the kind of groundbreaking swell of animation this would shepherd in.The concept is a fitfully simple and cute one: when kids are away,their toys take on personalities and lives of their own,plotting,planning,bickering,reacting,flirting,etc. In this particular den of toys, a Cowboy Woody doll(voiced by Tom Hanks) is the leader,flanked by a Slinky dog(Jim Varney),green toy soldiers(aptly casted R.Lee Ermey as their platoon leader),a Mr.Potato head(Don Rickles), a Piggy bank(John Ratzenberger,forever Cliff Claven from 'Cheers') and a Bo Peep doll(Annie Potts). Into the mix is a new,electronic Buzz Lightyear action figure(Tim Allen,who probably does the best voice acting of the bunch here),who almost instantly wows the locals and stirs jealousy from Woody.With music from Randy Newmann--a personal fave of mine--this movie's colors,attention to detail and wry humor make it easily adaptable to kids and adults alike. CAn it really be ten years since this film broke new ground on animation? How time flies in the wake of stuff like 'Shrek' and 'FInding Nemo'!",10,1,1,23 November 2005
Blood Diamond," Socio-political drama paired with action adventure
","Solomon Vandy(Djimon Honsou,to me,the best part of this movie)is little more than a simple farmer/fisherman in rural Sierra Leone. His simple life is interrupted when R.U.F. rebels sack his village,kidnap his son and force him into forced labor. When he stumbles upon a large diamond in the mines,he goes against better sense and hides the gem,which doesn't go unnoticed by his captors. He manages to get arrested,where he makes the acquaintance of mostly amoral diamond broker Danny Archer(Leonardo DiCaprio,who does his best to be as gritty and unsavory as possible here),who decides to sidle up to the village man to find the diamond he's accused of having. The two,along with a savvy,bright reporter named Maddy Bowman(Jennifer Connelly,intelligent and sporting the most inscrutable green-eyed stare),make the long trek back to the wilds of Siera Leone,looking for Solomon's family,which in turn is tied to the diamond Solomon found.Director Edward Zwick seems to like large,panoramic movie settings,and he seems to be the perfect director for this piece that utilizes as much of the wide,rough terrain of western Africa. Writer Charles Leavitt's script is rife with socio-political theming,and while it's as subtle as a sledgehammer,it's effective all the same. The acting performances move in a mostly perfect rhythm with the film's tone,particularly Honsou and DiCaprio. An effective blend of action and conscience,this movie should enthrall AND make the viewer think about the full cost of the bling that sells at your jeweler's.",9,0,1,15 December 2006
Men in Black," Very similar film viewing experience to 'Ghosbusters'
","I use the summary title line to infer that MIB,as was Ghostbusters before,was very much a 'cinema' movie. In other words,if you get a chance somehow to see this on the large screen,do it! The energy,special effects and rollicking rhythm of the movie fits better on a large screen with full sound.Borrowing on elements of any alien,sci-fi movie(and a few t.v. shows,like 'Project UFO' and 'X-Files')and throwing in a healthy dose of humor to create a fairly unique take on the 'alien invasion' genre.Will Smith is a NYPD detective whose pursuit of a perp has him witnessing something he didn't expect he ever would see. For this,he is recruited by a grim-looking but humored agent(Tommy Lee Jones),who proceeds to explain the mission of his organization,the Men in Black,a super-secret organization that has no official ties to the government,has been in existence for over thirty years and is 'the first,best and only line of defense' against rogues from other galaxies. Reluctant at first,Smith's character Edwards decides to give up his identity and join this elite group,partnering with JOnes' Agent K. Their assignment happens to be none other than tracking the bug creature who has possessed the body of a loathsome Kansas redneck farmer(played with absolute physical brilliance by Vincent D'Onofrio!),who has malevolent designs on EArth and the galaxy.BArry Sonnenfeld,who also helmed 'Addams Family' and 'Get Shorty',is hardly what I'd consider a perfect director('Big Trouble','Life With Mikey'? anyone?),but he seems right for this film,as it is played mostly for laughs,but with enough action to not bore most audiences. It's also kept juvenile enough to appeal to the kid demographic,much like 'Ghostbusters'.One last thing it has in common with it's 80s ectoplasmic cousin(besides the fact that hey were both produced by Columbia/Tri-Star)is that their sequels were watchable but nowhere near as good as the originals.",8,2,3,10 May 2005
The Graduate," Could this kind of movie be done again?
","Mike Nichols directs and Dustin Hoffman stars in this film that is now considered by many to be a classic(I would be one to concur).The performances in this film are unforced and not overstated,in particular Dustin Hoffman(in only his second movie role at the time and his first featured part)and Anne Bancroft(rest her soul!) as Ben Braddock and the bored,sexy and controlling Mrs.Robinson. Katharine Ross' Elaine Robinson is,for the most part,playing 'straight-man' to the proceedings but she,too,is winsome and likable here. Buck Henry's script isn't so much hilarious as it is sharp,clever and amusing. Mike Nichols' direction seems to be almost 'hands off' as the long camera shots and gradual pacing of dialogue is meant to accent the awkwardness and anticipation of the movie's characters.I imagine that many young men(I for one)have imagined having a sexual relationship with an older,more sophisticated woman. This movie,based on a book that I was not,I confess,fully aware of,examines the reality of a relationship like this. From time to time,movies have been made to explore this theme since,ranging from thoughtful and sweet(Harold and Maude) to crass and exploitive(My Tutor,anyone?). I wonder if any movie about an unusual and possibly wrong MAy/December relationship could be made again like this film. Granted,it works against the perfect backdrop:WASPy,wealthy,post-Kennedy America. But I feel like the themes here could be explored again,if done like this.In summary, a good 'theme' movie with classic performances and lines. By no means a 'howler' of a comedy,but worth a look for film connoisseurs anywhere.",10,1,2,10 July 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An Unconventional Love Story
","Joel Barish(Jim Carrey),depressed and forlorn over being pushed out of a relationship with his flaky but irresistible girlfriend Clementine(Kate Winslet),decides he'll also go to get his memory erased at an experimental procedure,headed by a kindly doctor(Tom Wilkinson). During the process,Joel makes the realization that he,in fact,despite the pains that Clementine put him through,doesn't really want to lose those memories of her,and proceeds to fight the process as it is happening to him.Director Michel Gondry co-wrote this story with none other than existential re-arranger non-pareil Charlie Kaufmann,and the end product is no less stunning or thought-provoking. Basically,this film is a love story minus the rapturous wonder of BEING in love. It's a realization of appreciating a relationship and what one gets from it,through the good AND bad. This is a concept that's probably been danced around before,but I have to believe it's never quite been examined THIS way before.Jim Carrey and KAte Winslet are in rare form here,Carrey in particular. Eschewing his usual,rubber-faced absurdity in favor of a straight caricature,while it's not a complete departure for him(some examples: MAn on the Moon,The Truman Show),it is somewhat out of form for the one-time stand-up,and he is excellent here. Winslet gets a chance to A)not be English and B)be a character that is probably somewhat difficult to be lifted from the pages it's been written on. Wilkinson's role as a doctor who may be more scrupulously at question here doesn't APPEAR to be different than usual(try In the Bedroom),but he still mines this one for effectiveness. The supporting turns by Mark Ruffalo,Elijah Wood,Kirsten Dunst,Jane Adams and David Cros are considerably less defined but(particularly in Dunst's case)nicely workable into the fabric of this story.Difficult movie material to relate to any average audience to be sure,but as another comment person put it,if you 'get it' with this film,this will be quite the positive movie experience.",10,0,2,6 April 2006
Taken," Clichés and lack of character development aside,it's easy to be taken with Taken
","Quiet divorce Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson,someone I figured was overdue for doing a movie like this and he doesn't disappoint!)lives a solitary life,pining only to stay close to his now near-adult daughter's life. His attractive ex(Famke Janssen,not minding to sacrifice her sexiness for grit)has re-married to a super rich guy,and he can give said daughter(Maggie Grace)anything she wants. Fortunately for our hero,she still wants--at least when she's not momentarily blinded by all the cool things she can get and do--her daddy's love and approval.A long-coveted trip to France(that is semi-supervised,of course)is what Kim,the daughter,gets from her folks,despite her dad's misgivings. Sure enough,her and her friend's bags have settled on the Rue-de-Place hotel floors more than an hour when some brutish,swarthy thugs violently overtake both girls and leave only vague,residual clues to what they're gonna do with them.Of course,said thugs didn't count on Kim's dad being an excellent spy,a 'fixer' who has plenty of contacts and a wealth of skills in tracking and neutralizing hostile foes.Director Luc Beeson(who,I'll be honest,I was not fully aware of helming this picture when I decided upon seeing it)may be stooping a bit by helming this pretty straight-forward action genre flick--the guy helm-ed the trippy,near-definition busting SciFi offering The Fifth Element for crying out loud!!--but he has a more than competent feel for the frenetic,fast-paced activity and story here. I cannot give this TOO high of marks simply because the whole run of this story has a few too many clichés and many,if not most viewers,will recognize the standard chain of events right away. Not to mention the near lack of character development(heck,even Neeson's character only gets a broad outline when you really think about it),this movie would seem to be shallow entertainment. Still,it's hugely satisfying and,at a blistering 93 minutes,it doesn't leave the viewer enough time to dwell on the show's deficiencies. Perhaps it's playing dirty pool with audiences,but this movie works on a very basic and involving level. At the risk of using the oh-so-ready word play supplied by the movie's title,I think Taken is an appropriate title for this punchy,effective ride of a film.",8,2,3,12 May 2009
Toy Story 2," Same formula,same results...which for this is good
","In 1999,the PIXAR gang was rife with limited(but growing)success from 1995's Toy Story and 1998's A Bug's Life. Disney and much of the film world still seemed somewhat cautious(if not skeptical),and probably figured a four year wait on following up the to-date signature success entry was a safe number for a company that was far too comfortable with(and at the time,had not yet been shaken away from)traditional,hand-drawn animation. While the success of this entrant did not prove them wrong,it may've opened the door to much more of what we Se today in movies:mostly or completely computerized animation.The story of this Toy Story is pretty much an inverse to the first,only this time,instead of Buzz Lightyear being whisked away from the group somehow,it's Cowboy Woody's turn to somehow get swept away from the herd. When Woody(voice of Tom Hanks)rescues a forgotten toy penguin named Wheezy from being a cheap sale at the family garage sale,he is taken up,bought and locked away by an unscrupulous toy store magnet named Al(voice of Wayne Knight,which may've been the most inspired of this inspired vocal casting of this film). Without their traditional leader,the toys get behind Buzz(Tim Allen,just piling on to his 'Kid/Family friendly' career in movies and t.v.) to try and rescue their friend,for which the journey is going to be a lot more perilous than the last time out.The whole gang is back for this one: Don Rickles as Mr.Potato Head,John Ratzenberger(A PIXAR favorite)as Hamm the Piggy bank,the late JIm VArney as Slinky Dogg,Annie Potts as Bo Peep,R.Lee Ermey as the Toy soldier leader,Wallace Shawn as T-Rex and Estelle Harris as Mrs.POtato Head. Added to the mix(and Not to the least importance)are Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammar as Yodeling Cowboy Annie and Prospector Stinky Pete(respectively),two toys from the obsolete line of characters from which Woody was brought out of,both wanting to reunite with Woody permanently. Additional voice help is a myriad of talent,much of whom(such as the late JOe RAnft)are also PIXAR regulars,and add a lot of solid background to this effort. Directors John LAsseter and Ash Brannon,working off a script co-authored by Lasseter and Pete Docter,are able to seamlessly,seemingly effortlessly craft something bold,beautiful and unique out of almost the same construct and characters,which is no mean feat. A keeper of a movie,whether you have kids or are just a big kid yourself.",9,0,1,13 July 2007
Up," A somber,wistful heart at the center of another buoyant PIXAR film
","Widower Carl Fredrickson(voice of Ed Asner)feels like his time left could best be spent fulfilling the dream that he and his wife shared:namely,to fly off and explore the wilds of South America. A balloon salesman for a good part of his adult life,he decides to use his inventory to lift and carry away the old home that he shared with her for the forty some years they were together. And why not? The house is surrounded by a massive re-urbanizing development and there's considerable pressure on him to sell his beloved home. Rather than do that,he's set on taking his dreams in tact with him to do the things that he lived a lifetime putting off.The plans seem great. One hitch:a chubby,overly chatty World Explorer Scout named Russell,who is doggedly intent on helping Carl to finish his badge accumulation.The rest of the story is the main motor of this latest offering by the revolutionary studio. A struggle to navigate to the mythic falls point of the region(they miss the target,landing on the far other side of the plateau),as they are joined by a mythic wild bird and a voice-collar speaking hunting dog,defending against the hunting wishes of a lost explorer(voice of Christopher Plummer),whose singular vision to chase HIS aspirations have turned him into something g far less noble than he once was or appeared.This is a nice,sometimes inspired,sometimes funny,somewhat maudlin story that has nothing really wrong with it(save a suspension of disbelief over,among other things,the physics of a balloon-carried old-style home being carried,in tact,over thousands of miles). Director Pete Docter and co-writer,co-director Bob Petersen(who voices many of the dogs in the story,particularly Dug,the afore-mentioned dog that greets the intrepid travelers initially)supply a perfectly smart,engaging and entertaining film. I,personally,couldn't quite warm up to it as wholly as past PIXAR adventures(Toy Story,Buig's Life,Finding Nemo and WALL-E come to mind),but I still found this easily very entertaining and reasonably endearing(the dogs with talking collars particularly tickled me). Some rather depressing,adult themes and a longer-than-expected opening might test the patience of some,but this film largely is able to,like its title,stay buoyant throughout.",8,0,0,2 July 2009
A Clockwork Orange," Book compliments movie,and vice-versa
","This Stanley Kubrick adaptation of Anthony Burgess' 1963 novel is something of a revelation of movie-making. It is truly very European in its make-up:the hero of the film is hardly an exemplary figure and the situations are dreary and morally difficult to make absolute. In other words,this is probably not the kind of film you'd find Michael Medved recommending.Alex(a young Malcolm MacDowall,Sting look-alike)and his cronies--his 'droogs'--spend an average evening in bars drinking a milk-based narcotic that makes them more rowdy and violent. On one particular evening,they kick the snot out of a homeless man,get in a fight with a rival gang of droogs and end up pillaging and raping a rich old man and his young wife in his mansion.On another evening,Alex and his mates decide they'll try to rob a little old lady in her apartment. When the burglary goes awry,his mates abandon him and he ends up killing the woman,Alex is arrested and taken away to prison. From there,he learns to become a 'model prisoner' in order to get fast-tracked for a form of prisoner medical experimentation. Little does he realize(until it's too late)that the experimentation that he's been sold on,to 'cure' his violent urges,is a draconian and brutal form of mental reprogramming involving mind-altering drugs and forced film-viewing.Once released back into the world,Alex may no longer be violent,but that proves of absolutely no help to him as he tries to quietly reenter the society.The book is a little harder to digest,but still is brilliantly written,so this movie actually gives flesh to the images and ideas created in it. I liken that to 'American Psycho',only in that case I found the movie actually an IMPROVEMENT over the book. Kubrick seems very much at home with this grim,futuristic cautionary tale. It dovetails nicely with the film he did previously,a little experimental ditty called '2001:A Space Odyssey',also set in the future but comparatively sterile and detached when contrasted to 'Clockwork'. MacDowall,who rarely(if ever)commands leading roles anymore,is superb as the lead character,who is detestable,lovable,pathetic and sympathetic ALL in the same film. Not necessarily a must-see,but a deserved memorable offering at that.",10,0,2,29 June 2005
Groundhog Day," Only a few real problems with it
","Smug,snide,cynical and dripping with more than an ounce of well-trained insincerity,Pittsbugh local Weatherman Phil Conners(Bill Murray,whose performance here SEEMS to be his usual,languid,wise-ass self,but upon further review,is arguable one of his most slyly executed performance of his career!)is NOT looking forward to covering Groundhog Day in nearby Punxatawney(spelling?). He isn't too thrilled with who he's being dispatched to cover it with:a bright new producer(Andie MacDowall)and an unassuming but equally wise-ass cameraman he's worked with before(Chris Elliott). Come the actual event,Phil goes through the motions,then is crestfallen to find out he'll be stuck in Punxatawney THROUGH the day(he was set to leave town that afternoon) and have to spend one more night at a quaint bed-and breakfast where he doesn't fit in.That would soon prove to be the LEAST of his problems,as he begins to relive the same Feb.2nd ad infinitum.Murray's performance here is really worth more than a cursory glance:in having to relive the same day over and over and over(and over)again,his Phil is left open to relive it in both generous and selfish ways. As he continually re-crafts the same routines(And tries,in increasingly more grim fashions to escape it),he begins to learn about things and people he absolutely never would,not the least of which his attraction and affinity for his producer.Director Harold Ramis has been far more cursed with loser material(a remake of Bedazzled,anyone? How about the incomplete idea of Multiplicity?)than good stuff,but here,with Second City and Ghostbusters cohort Murray,he is able to craft a film that,while it seems to be unable to find a way to wrap itself up(and is probably my biggest gripe of this film),is still both cuttingly funny,poignant AND somewhat philospohical in its mien. While I'm not even close to being an Andie McDowall fan(I think this and Short Cuts are the only two films of hers I've thought she was pretty good in),she is a very effectively placed foil. The sub-characters,given the way this film is constructed,are actually asked,in some parts,to CARRY this film more than most movies would allow(including obnoxious INsurance salesman Phil doesn't recall played by Stephen Toblowski,a 'Long lost love interest named NAncy,the other B&B guests and patrons)and it has such fun with quick cuts and restructuring the film's series of events that you could argue this is actually about TWENTY or THIRTY movies in one. Absurd,funny and more than a little off-putting,Groundhog Day is a film that you won't forget soon after viewing it.",8,0,1,3 February 2007
Pretty Woman," Different ratings,then and now
","I saw this film in the theater,Spring of 1990. I was eighteen at the time(do the math!),and so that may've affected how I felt about the movie then,because asked then how I would've rated it,I probably would've given it a ten. Nine at the lowest.Mostly,I was in love with Julia Roberts at the time,and why not? She was a rising young star at the time,effervescent and able to absolutely run with this film the way Barry Sanders or Emmitt Smith(American footballers for those of you reading not from the US or don't follow the NFL or sports in general)could run with the pigskin.Also,I loved how the Cinderella story was played with not too much sentiment(up until the last fifteen minutes,of course)and a lot of humor. Richard Gere seemed to make a good,sober counterbalance to Miss Roberts' earthy,relaxed persona,as well.Looking back on it now and having re-watched it a number of times,the film loses points with me on two levels. One,I've become increasingly annoyed with director Garry Marshall's style,which seems to be intent on making the world believe that fairy tales are everywhere and love is the natural storybook end to EVERY relationship. Second,I think this story is SO Hollywood sanitized that what it lacks in a particularly plausible storyline in tries to make up for in attractive,glossed up casting(I betting it's pretty tough to find a hooker ANYWHERE who looks as good as a young Julia Roberts!)and a sugary sweet ending.It was good enough for me back when I was young and hadn't seen as many films,not so good now.Not to mention making a capable comic foil actor such as Jason Alexander so one-dimensional that it makes you wonder how he scored the 'Seinfeld' gig!Still,I find it to be charming and reasonably(albeit shamelessly) entertaining enough to watch it again,which I have since I actually own a copy of the film.Keep in mind,that,too,was something I got as a gift,when(you guessed it)I was eighteen.",6,13,23,28 March 2005
Inside Man," Great concept, strong cast and yet...{{Spoilers Possible}}
","...something feels a little wanting here.Spike Lee,continuing to gradually drift away from the straight,socio-political meat movies that made him famous(Do the Right Thing,Jungle Fever,Malcolm X,Get On the Bus) and towards more general genres(Crooklyn,Clockers,Girl 6,Summer of Sam)helms this film which is intended to be a crime caper. I say intended because the story takes fragmented turns throughout,no doubt to be the(or part of the)'twist'this movie aims for.On a seemingly typical New York City morning at a large branch bank,a highly elaborate robbery takes place and in the process,a large number of hostages are taken. The leader of this effort,Dalton Ross(Clive Owen,interesting choice and doesn't disappoint)has planned this effort to the letter,creating a situation that has the NYPD scrambling. One detective,Frazier(Denzel Washington,cool and smart,game for any head-game out there) is reading the situation and seems to be able to make a psychological connection with Ross. At the same time,the upright bank founder and owner(Christopher Plummer),sensing that there may be some sort of sticky mess on the loom thanks to this burglary,employs an outside agent--a 'fixer',as she's referred to--named White(Jodie Foster)to try to work in concert with the police get what he wants.As said before,this is a neat concept of a film:basically,a crime caper that sort of 'knows' what it is and yet moves at a somewhat different pacing and aim. I'm coming perilously close to revealing stuff about this film,so I'll only say that you the viewer if you choose to watch this will be well-advised to AVOID jumping to any conclusions during the run of the movie. I say that,because I kinda fell into that trap a few times while watching this. Writer Russell Gewirtz's script seems to be striving to be a little TOO clever,and the cut-aways and non-sequitirial jumps in the linnear progress of the story can be somewhat(if not a lot)discombobulating and irritating. Washington and Owen are strong here,Foster doesn't seem to quite belong in this movie and plummer seems to be playing something he's been playing a little too often,namely upright elder-statesmen who have potential for keeping ugly skeletons in their closets. Director Lee's social commentary is limited but smart,with the very few of his observations leveled mostly on the NYPD police and how they can over-react and assume(a la profiling)to suspects or perceived suspects in a crisis situation.Interesting,somewhat difficult to warm up to,I'd still say that this film shouldn't let down fans of most of the principals of this film(particularly Denzel's). My only real tip for viewing this movie is this:watch it to the end and keep an open mind.",7,1,2,7 September 2006
It's a Wonderful Life," Another 'No dry eyes' film for me
","I've seen this movie at least in part or in entirety a number of times,and one thing that does not fail to happen when I do is that I am practically walloped over the head with emotion. I'm not sure if it's the themes of the movie(i.e.no man's life is a waste if he has love/friends,everybody has an impact on someone else whether they know it or not,etc.),the innocence of this movie and the era,the sincere,haunting acting or even the swelling(some might say saccharine-sweet)music score. Perhaps it's all of those elements! I'm not really sure and I don't think I really care. All I can say to this is this movie is effective and universal and well worthy of the kind of replay it gets every year(albeit before NBC bought up nearly all the rights of domestic broadcast about fifteen years years ago,this show got MASSIVE OVERPLAY on countless local affiliates and independent stations,which might test the last statement).The life of hardworking,dutiful Savings and LOan manager George Bailey(JAmes Stewart,pretty fresh off a tour or two of duty during WWII;in arguably the more moving performances of his long and storied career)seems to amount to nothing as his work and home-life seem to be crumbling around him. Contemplating the abyss,he is rescued by a dim but lovable apprentice angel named Clarence(Henry Travers)shows him what the world around him would be like without him in it.Memorable and effective supporting performances from Lionel Barrymore(vital and irreplaceable as mean old Mr.Potter),Donna Reed(As George's wife Mary)and various lesser roles that add to the pastiche augment director Frank Capra's most identifiable opus. As mentioned in a previous review I wrote(as well as the summary line),this movie falls very squarely in my category of films that don't fail to make me well-up with tears,and while that might say more about me than the movie itself,I happen to believe that if you take any of the messages or morals of this story to heart,you'll be moved by it,too.",9,0,4,15 December 2007
Enemy at the Gates," Works more as fictionalized history than as historical fiction
","Vasilli Zaitsiev(Jude Law,rugged features and green eyes a-blazing)becomes a folk hero in be-sieged Stalingrad,1942-43. And it seems perfectly reasonable:the de-moralized and starving locals and Soviet army dispatch is facing the brutal,relentless pressure of the advancing NAzi armies,so a deadly effective sniper who has the German's guessing their ground strategy is naturally gonna be greatly needed. Of course,this walking hero/legend is also all flesh and blood,as he is both being lionized by a local patrician/officer(Joseph Fieenes,looking more and more like Ralph all the time)and carrying a growing torch for a local girl(RAchel Weisz,still radiant through mud,muck and blood)who happens to work the infantry and is fluent in German.That happens to be exactly what an ace marksman and officer in the SS named KOnig(ED HArris,fantastic as the coldly determined,not altogether inhuman German menace)is hoping for,as he scans and scours the streets of the war-torn central Russian town to finish off.HAving just read(More like scanned)a review that had a very dim view of the re-telling of actual historical fact,I think I can say that this movie is(without being nearly as EAgle-eyed as that reviewer)probably more intended to be sheer entertainment rather than a particularly close examination or documentation of the very pivotal and important battle that has by many been thought to be one of the key turning points in WWII. That will leave people who want to see more studious retelling in the cold,and even as pure entertainment will seem a little flat. Still,the characters and situations are just fleshed-out and kept compelling enough that a lesser invested viewer(like myself,for instance) will come away feeling reasonably satisfied,if not 'wowed'. Director JEan-Jacques Arnaud seems to be content making a much larger pieced of World history a much more intimate and human struggle,and it doesn't make for TOO uncomfortable of a film experience. If one feels much desire to see this at all,it would probably fall pretty safely in the category of 'Renter'.",8,1,2,27 October 2008
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," So what if it's ten years too late,this still rocks!
","A film reviewer--I cannot recall if it was Entertainment Weekley or a local reviewer--very flippantly reviewed this movie with a couple of short paragraphs and dismissed it something to the tune of(I'm paraphrasing,of course)this movie being a decade or so late in capturing the fresh,raw quality that was Tenacious D,since they'd been a hot cult act dating back to the mid-nineties and by now had been well-exposed and almost(inferred here)passÃ©. To that person,I say 'Fie!' This show still rocks,even if it seems a little stunted and hurried.The account of the meeting and 'coming to be' of 'The D'--actor/musicians JAck Black and Kyle Gass--is no doubt laced with embellishment and,no doubt,could've been released a while back,but it still more than maintains the raw power,enthusiasm and energy that the D brings to their shows. A stripped-down cast that features somewhat inexplicable cameos by the likes of Tim Robbins,Amy Poehler,Fred Armisen,Ben Stiller and Mealoaf(and an energetic turn by Foo Fighters frontman DAve Grohl as Ol' Scratch himself),this movie is pretty much otherwise ALL JB and KG,and as such it is a fun ride. Director Liam Lynch must be a fan of the duo,because they are pretty much setting the pace here.So in sum,it may've been a film that was ten or eleven years overdue,but this IS certainly a Tenacious D movie and if you're any amount of fan of the legendary pair,this should not disappoint.",8,0,0,28 April 2008
The Departed," Unrelenting!
","I'm aware of the fact that the concept and basic storyline for Martin Scorcese's Departed actually came from a Hong Kong/Chinese crime drama epic from a few years back. I cannot attest to what the original was,but after seeing this film,I'd be curious to see it.This movie is arguably one of--if not THE strongest film out this fall. I'm always a little reluctant to go crazy lauding directors like Scorcese,Coppola,Spielberg and so forth because they are iconic and seem to have praise larded on them by the truckloads,but suffice it to say that there's a reason Mr.Scorcese gets the kind of laudation he gets,and this movie is one example of why.Set in working class Boston,this film tracks the lives of two principal characters:Colin'Sully'Sullivan(Matt Damon,who's chiseled,straight,expressionless face and easy demeanor is perfect here),a model citizen from the neighborhoods who excels his way from academy into heading his own vice unit in record time,and William 'Billy'Costigan(Leonardo DiCaprio,who seems to work well off Scorcese's calls,as per The Aviator from a few years before), another working class Irish Bostonian whose road to the Boston PD is much rougher and is recruited to do undercover work. Early on,you know who's who here:Sullivan is in the deep pockets of simmering,sleazy mob boss Frank Costello(Jack Nicholson,whose only flaw in this film was his wavering Boston accent)and is a link to the law enforcers who are trying to tag him,while Costigan steadily builds his links and confidence into Mr.Costello's outfit. All the while,both Sully and Billy build relationships with the police psychologist(Vera Farmiga,whom I also enjoyed in 2002's Dummy),and meanwhile work around each other. As both sides start to sense that there is a rat in their ranks,the two find themselves pushing harder to simultaneously do their jobs,cover their tracks and root the other out. The race is on,so to speak. With quality support from Mark Wahlberg(as an incorruptible and temperamental bureau sub-chief),Martin Sheen(as Wahlberg's boss,a patient precinct veteran),Anthony Anderson(as the honest cop who works for Damon's corrupt chief),Ray Winstone(as Nicholson's brutal top henchman)and Alec Baldwin(as the charismatic paper-pusher whose investigative unit backs Damon's squad),this movie is a strong shock to the system,with violence often and yet used as a sort of gut-check to the viewer. In a war between cops and gangland criminals,the results are unrelenting and brutal,and seldom romantic.The pacing of this film takes on more of a thriller mode towards the end,and there are a few twists thrown in to make the ending not as 'neat' as some might suspect it's heading towards. The screenplay by William Monahan and Siu Fui Mak(adapting from the original)is a seamless fit to Scocese's vision. I don't like throwing phrases like 'must see' or 'instant classic',so instead I'll say this about it:if you're serious about your movies,catch this film any way you can.",9,1,2,30 October 2006
Psycho," A film that will stay in you LONG after you've seen it
","What more can be said about Alfred Hitchcock's most popularly received(perhaps not his best,quality-wise)film?Perhaps this: some forty-five years after it was released,it's still referenced and easily accessible movie in regards to movies creating visceral dread and natural shock. Even though Hitch wanted to make this as spare and nuanced a movie as he possibly could(note that this was a B&W film in 1960,when most movies had gone to color and various forms of 'Sens-a-round' type cinema gimmicks of the period to capture.'shock' and 'thrill' moviegoers),the amount of care put into matching Bernard Hermann's tense score with the seemingly common-place events leading towards the horrors being hidden in the Bates Motel. Lastly,the show is a veritable maze of curiosity,where the film begins as a tracking of the moral quandaries of one MArion Crane(Janet Leigh,beautiful and haunting as a VERY weak and corruptible character here),who,working a dead-end job and having an affair with a married man,decides to abscond with $40,000 of an investor's money. Her run from,well,everything,leads her to the seedy BAtes motel and one Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins,whose long career boiled down to this role). The rest is pretty well-known by anyone familiar with this movie.This is a must-see for ANY film-lover. And in all likelihood,this movie will stay with the viewer,images AND sounds,long after one has viewed it.",9,1,1,13 December 2005
War of the Worlds," Good film,not great; almost sullied by needless publicity stunts
","I must admit that the main culprits of this film are not the ones at fault--if there is any--if this film has leaks and shortcomings,which I feel like it does have just enough to cut into its value. Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise for their parts do what is fully right and necessary to make this remake of the 1953 movie and 1938 radio play effective,entertaining and disturbing. To be brutally honest,I've been less than thrilled with the idea of Cruise and Spielberg,both monster egos each,TEAMING to do a movie. Again. Then the three month long publicity crapfest that led up to the show,mostly revolving around Tom Cruise and his love for Katie Holmes(no comment there) and his 'crusade' for America's children(read:his crusade for Scientology). Add to that,Paramount/Dreamwork's refusal to screen the movie in advance,and I was less than receptive to the idea of adding my $6 to this. Enough good word from people I knew who saw it and reviewers caused me to cave in. I think I can say I'm mostly glad I did. Strip away some of the more gruesome images,and this film is basically a long 'Chase movie'. Dockworker and delinquent dad Ray Ferrier(Cruise) is left alone with his kids while his ex-wife goes up to Boston to be with her folks. Wouldn't ya know it,the alien(Martian perhaps?) tripod destructo-battle ships emerge from the ground and proceed to vaporize and squash everything that runs THAT VERY day. Ray takes his kinder(DAkotah Fanning,the hardest working grade-schooler in showbiz,and Justin Chatwick) and makes a run to Boston,but not without,eh...ahem,problems. Tim Robbins is thrown into the mix(and steals his scenes) as a rapidly deteriorating(mentally)survivor.This film has no fewer than five logistic and continuity gaps,and it is rife with all the Spielberg trademarks of emotional button-jamming through imagery,but it is still effective and worth a look if(and this is a BIG IF)you're up for it,and not everyone will be.",7,0,1,15 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," 2/3 of a raucous,funny summer movie is better than none at all
","This summer comedy--a 'sex comedy',if you will--is a great romp for the first 2/3 and a passable,if unremarkable and even somewhat cloying,final third.Jeremy and John(Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson,both terrific here!)are WAshington D.C. arbitration lawyers who have become ace practitioners of going on the make at a variety of weddings in the D.C. area. They are lithe and enthusiastic in plying their craft,bedding as many cute,willing-to-marry honeys and leaving behind little or no trace of themselves along the way. Their ability to mold into differing weddings of various religions and cultures is a feat to behold,an nearly athletic endeavor of achievement. Alas,they,while completely carnally satisfied,find themselves at a point of emptiness. They're getting older(read:late thirties)and yet feeling like they're missing...something. Prety familiar stuff so far,but still done with a deft touch.As fate would have it,they target the wedding of the oldest daughter of a prominent government official(Christopher Walken,well-cast)and set their sights on his two younger daughters(RAchel McAdams and Isla Fisher,both sexy and very charming). However,the boys cleave ways when they discover their targeted conquests are far more than they bargained for.Director David Dobkin and writer Bob Fisher(there's another writer credited. I forget at this moment whom) are able to make this film both clever and yet familiar,sexy and yet sweet and the ability of the actors(Vaughn mostly)to ad-lib through the film make this film as fluid as it is kinetic. Add in Dr.Quinn herself,one JAne Seymour,as the horny,bitter wife of Walken's character to the mix and you have one largely entertaining comedy that screams 'Summer flick!' all over. If you dig comedies,but want something that trips along smoothly(albeit fairly predictably),then this film is for you.",7,0,1,9 October 2005
There Will Be Blood," There will also be sweat,tears,mud,oil,rocks,fire....
","...greed,duplicity,soul-killing,revenge and VOLUME. Not all in that order,of course.Paul Thomas Anderson's been somewhat of an odd duck when it comes to film subjects. Here is the order of what he's assayed so far: gambling addiciton(HArd Eight),the pornography industry,circa the late 1970s and early 1980s(Boogie Nights),the LA middle class scene(Magnolia)and the odd,inward social awkwardness of romance between two people who have major issues(Punch-Drunk Love). And now we have...the Oil prospecting trade of turn of the 20th century California,cribbed at least in spirit from Upton Sinclair's muckraking book 'Oil!'. So much for discernible patterns in film-making,huh?Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day-Lewis,in only his third movie role since 1997,and breathing fire through much of this,as usual)is very much the model of the 'robber baron' capitalist of his era:shrew,savvy,driven and maybe more than a little sociopathic. He has no life outside of work,and he works very hard,first as a gritty prospector then,as he is able to stake his fortune on land claims,as a salesman toward developing untapped oil fields through much of the western United States. When he lands down in New Boston,a dusty rural community in central California,he is able to sell a religiously devout community on drilling up their arid,unfertile fields,primarily getting the rights from the pious(and possibly brutal)Sunday family,led by the charismatic Eli(Paul Dano,in an awesome breakthrough role!). A deal is brokered to set the wheels in motion for Plainview's drilling,but figuring the nature of this business and Plainview's very skewed,removed persona,that deal is ripe for being dishonored.A two-and-a-half hour film that uses probably only 2/3 of it for dialog(including the nearly mute opening twenty minutes),Anderson's film--which he also wrote--is a test in patience as much as it is a template for acting and character study. Since the action in this movie is at a steady,almost monotonous pace(not to mention the sexual element of this film is nearly nil),and the characters take a while to reach emotional crescendo,some viewers will be turned off by this very casual journey to discovery. DAy-Lewis is as good as advertised as the central figure,but save for him,Dano,Kevin O'Connor(as someone who may or may not be from PLainview's past) and,perhaps,PLainview's adopted son(Dillon Freasier,a quiet study in unforced presence),this show is mostly full of ancillary characters who fill out necessary scenes but have little development. Bottom line:as unique and well-realized as this story and film is,it is a demanding movie that expects the viewer to come prepared to want what it has to offer,just as badly as the viewer is going to expect the movie to give it entertainment(if not more so). I give this movie high marks for the individuality and intelligence it offers,but would hold back on it as a whole movie because,for all it offers on artistic merit,it still feels just a tad hollow. Maybe that was intentional,but then that would make this offering much more for the discriminating tastes than for the casual viewer. THere's a lot this film has to offer,and much of it comes from the product of actions as much as motivations(hence my summary line). Lewis' performance ranks among his best,and if one can appreciate fully that AND the meditation being offered,then one will feel truly rewarded by 'There Will be Blood'. A strong nine(or perhaps a weak ten)out of ten stars.",9,1,6,11 February 2008
Man on Fire," Acting saves this one,directing nearly kills it
","I just saw this movie this afternoon. The summary I wrote about sums it. This is,by and large,a well-fleshed out revenge pic,and the actors do their best to make this one credible. Particularly,it's Washington,Walken,Mitchell and Dakotah Fanning who add weight to the material. The violence of the last hour and a half contrasted with the quiet charm of the first fifty minutes could almost make TWO movies.   It's tempting for your more cynical audience member to laugh off the heavy-handed sentiment and morality of the film,but given the set-up of the story, it would seem rather out of sync if it became completely amoral and dark. Director Scott's overusage of jump-cuts,fancy editing and(for lack of a beter word to describe it)subtitles threaten to turn this film hokey,so the pressure is on the leads to deliver something sober and true and they just achieve it. Denzel in particular is very good at switching from reflective,depressed former government op to steeled,enraged and efficient killing machine,and it is nice to see Walken play someone who is NOT a creepy,edgy baddie for once. Overall,watchable and satisfying. 6 out of 10",6,0,0,28 April 2004
Army of Darkness," 81 minutes of pure fun!
","The third--and presumably last--of the Evil Dead movies finds Ash Williams(B-movie supreme ruler Bruce Campbell in full froth)somehow transported(along with his broken down car)in Medieval England,about to do battle,once again,with the undead,with the aid of(among other things) his 'boom stick' and his chainsaw. While being a strange man in a strange land,he romances plucky lass Sheila(Embeth Davitz,pre-Schindler's List) and aiding the reluctant natives(among them Ian Abercrombie,MArcus Gilbert and Richard Groce).To me(and I suspect I am not alone on this),one of the neat things about this film is that it moves at such a rip-roaring pace that one has little time to catch their breath or even add up the absurdity of the story. But,to quote another commenter,Who cares? This offering,which pretty much eschews the original Evil Dead's Horror premise,and capitalizes on more of the crazed,feverish pacing of Evil Dead 2,seems content to offer large doses of humor mixed with raucous violence and only the thinnest character exposition. Bully for director/co-writer Sam Raimi,co-writer Ivan Raimi and company on this! This is a great 'palate-cleanser' of a movie and is a solid party film(among other occasions),whether you're fans of Campbell,Raimi,berserker action films,comedies or all four.",10,63,74,28 March 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Deep,dark fictionalized historical drama,anchored by a devastatingly powerful performance
","I,personally,knew only the most vague stuff about Ugandan President Idi Amin Dada,and some-perhaps much-of what I knew was legend. Something that was generally accepted was that he was a violent and brutal leader. What this movie,penned by Jeremy Brock and Giles Foden(adapted off a novel,the name of the author escapes me)and directed by Kevin McDonald(not to be confused with the lanky Canadian comedic actor from 'Kids in the Hall'),has done for me(And I know I'm not alone here)is catalog how such a brutal enforcer of a leader could be scarily winsome and charismatic as any other politician or demagogue. To be sure,I feel like this is neither a remarkable or unique development in the world of politics,but to get a closer look at this regime and the larger-than-life,mercurial man behind it is still eye-opening.Scotish Physician Nicholas Garrigan(James McAvoy,who makes me wonder if Hugh Grant has a long-lost Scottish relative)moves to Uganda on somewhat of a whim,expecting to do good for man plying his profession. Not long after being introduced to and working among the children and mothers in the mission he's assigned,he comes into an encounter with the then freshly crowned leader Amin on a chance encounter. Amin(Forrest Whitaker,an actor I've always appreciated,and for whom it makes me very happy to find in a role like this one,getting recognition he's getting for it!) blusters,poses and huffs big and magnanimously. He's a populist of the textbook kind:proudly flouting his humble roots and promising a government that won't poses the largess and graft of the previous regime. Garrigan,partly out of fear,partly out of true admiration of the man,goes along,semi-reluctantly at first,then nearly in oblivion afterwords. Over some years of living as amin's personal physician and(by Amin's own appellation)his personal adviser,Garrigan slowly comes to the realization,through both what he sees on the news and around him,as well as Amin's increasingly erratic behavior,that he's not working so much for a brash 'Man-of-the-people' but a very dangerous man. By then,however,Garrigan has made his proverbial deal with the Devil,and paying up for it will be inevitably brutal.Despite this being a vast,vivid sweep of Uganda and the 1970s landscape it held,this film's character study is remarkably sparse and concentrated. Amin and Garrigan(believed to be a composite character,based on about four westerners for whom worked in his administration for much of his reign,which was officially deposed in 1979)are the primarily focus here,and as such both Whitaker and McAvoy are strong here,though McAvoy's Garrigan(maybe intentionally so)could illicit incredulity as to how selectively naive someone in his position could be. Kerry Washington(As amin's third wife),Gillian Anderson(as the co-chief of the mission where Garrigan originally works),Simon McBurney(As the Brit diplomat,deep in the know)and David Oyedeno(As the former regime physician)show up and add to the story,but they are sparingly used,there to frame certain chapters in the turn of this relationship between ruler and doctor/adviser,and thusly,ruler and country.As hard to watch in parts fascinating and difficult to look away from in others,this movie may suffer a little from excess or of narrative abridgment,but it is as worthy as any movie to see this Oscar/Golden GLobe/whatever season. Whiatker in particular,makes this film worth the price of admission. Worth a look.",9,3,4,31 January 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Good summer tonic!
","This is hardly a perfect film. The plotting and logic of the film seem to trip along at breakneck speed(of course,I'm willing to buy the fact that that was the way it was intended)to the point of delirium. And it does seem to gloss over some of the finer points of San Diego(To echo what one person who wrote on the Imdb about the show who hailed from that area). But this film was still LMAO funny!  Steve Carell and, to a lesser degree,Paul Rudd really do steal their scenes! Ferrell is a blast as the overconfident,vain and somewhat doltish title character and Applegate earned every penny of her paycheck not cracking up through too many scenes. Offhand,this is a 3 out of 4 Star film,good tonic for those who grow eary of heavy-handed sci-fi/actioner movies being cranked out over the summer.",8,1,3,25 July 2004
American Gangster," Here's a Success Story you won't be learning in B-school
","If you were to hear someone tell a story of a man who,from hardscrabble beginnings,was able to rise up,become wealthy and successful beyond perhaps his own dreams and was able to out-produce his competitors so well that he was practically un-reachable,you'd probably think that this person was quite the successful businessman,and you'd be right. Throw in a small matter of that product the man in question sold was Heroin and that his competitors were often snuffed out,that he was basically using the Vietnam war as his own sort of 'in-and-out' route of business and that he was actually one of the most feared and sought-after mobsters in America over the last thirty or so years,and that,to put it mildly,changes things.And that's how you would classify one Frank Lucas(Denzel Washington,effectively combining his amoral bad-ass from 'Training Day' with his more charismatic character studies as a hero from films like 'Crimson Tide' or 'Remember the Titans'),a one-time gopher and right-hand man of legendary Harlem gang-lord Bumpy Johnson. When Bumpy passes in the late 1960s,Lucas moves quickly to consolidate power and uses his own sales methods to make the drug trade more direct,more economical and far more lucrative. IN short order,he's practically out-selling(and dominating)the established crime bosses(read:mostly the MAfia) in NYC,circa 1970 thru 1975.His chief nemesis is one Richie Roberts(Russell Crowe,kinda over-doing the 'New Yawk' accent here,but still genuinely real),an honest cop of near legendary status. Doggedly chasing Lucas and his syndicate for years(all while working his way through LAw school,no less!),his Vice cops follow his instincts to cover Lucas' terrain,shadowing his work until they can finally piece together just how large his empire stretches.An ambitious project all around,director Ridely Scott succeeds in what seems ordinary and remarkable:namely,making a two-and-half hour story about cops and peddlers in the Big Apple NOT seem pedestrian or ordinary,when the formula's been done countless times before. It doesn't hurt that Steven Zaillian(spelling?)'s script is cribbed from real-life events and is given such a plain,unpretentious presentation that it could pass for(At least in some parts)documentary. Not too many parts here shine out besides Washington and Crowe,but Ruby Dee(as Lucas' trusting mama),Idris Elba(as a less-than-subtle underling of Lucas')and Cuba Gooding Jr.(as one of Lucas' prime business associates and grudging rivals;arguably one of the rare good parts he seems to get these days)do stand out. This film and 'Zodiac' deserved,in my humble opine, more attention at award time,but maybe it's just as well that this 'flew under the radar'. Good work,it could be argued,is best appreciated when one can find it out on their own,and this is worth the seek.",9,0,2,8 February 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Too many thoughts to put into one summary line
","Stuff like 'Critics of Will Ferrell need see this movie and reconsider' or 'Charlie Kaufmann and Spike JOnze could've wrote this!' were some of the ideas that came to mind to sum the way I felt about this movie,but they really couldn't do this justice. THere's plenty of themes being played with in this off-beat,gentle and existential comedy,and I'm gonna TRY to cover all of them in this comment/review.FBI auditor HArold Crick(Will Ferrell,as docile and somber as he's EVER been in film to this point)lives the highly ordered,lonely lifestyle of someone who would be considered a nearly hermit-like control freak. Numbers,stats and equations are very much the gatekeepers of order in his world,and he approaches his job,just like everything else,with a sense of professionalism and efficiency. He has few friends,no discernible family,and has no great ambitions and goals in life.Somewhere through the order of work and life4,two things create a disruption:the interest he's feeling stir in him over a pretty,bakery manager he's about to audit(Maggie Gyllenhaal,whose large,pretty facial features and warm,sexy body language are as enticing as I've witnessed of any female lead in a comedy) and the small matter of a narrator's voice that has been correctly and acutely describing Harold's life that he(And only he)can hear. When he discovers that the voice is not only accurately describing every element of his life,but is hinting at his imminent demise,he starts to slowly realize that while he may be the center of his own narrative world,he is most certainly not in control of it.While this happens,dyspeptic author and recluse KAren 'KAy' Eiffel(Emma Thompson,who looks like she's been on a steady diet of black coffee,cigs and little-or-no sleep for weeks)wrestles with writer's block over her next novel,which has been on hold for over a decade. Sent to her is a no-nonsense editor's assistant(Queen Latifah,who is showing that she can dial it up as well as down with equal amounts of effectiveness) there to help tighten her finishing of the novel she's trying in great frustration to finish. The book Kay is trying to finish involves the mundane life and appropriate-yet-somewhat ironic demise of one very unremarkable character,one by the name of HArold Crick.As HArold tries to track the source of his distress,through shrinks and anyone who'll listen,he instinctively goes for the counsel of a English professor and literary expert named Hilbert(Dustin Hoffman,paternal,droll and patient;not qualities ordinarily admired in a performance for films,but very necessary here,and as such,very well done!),who tries to infuse guidelines for whether or not Harold's life falls into two basic literary constructs:comedy or tragedy. While HArold's quest to find a clear difference between the two elements seems to yield mixed results,it starts to clear things gradually to the IRS auditor that his life needs a narrative direction,and he may or may not have much time to figure that out.Directed by untraceable auteur Marc Forrester(unless YOU can link MOnster's Ball and Finding Neverland to this type of film) and written by relative new-by scribe Zack Helm,this movie would be oh SO easy to pigeonhole as an existential comedy or light drama,but it feels like more than that. It's kind of a knowing Dramady,a film and story that understands the constructs of narrative creation,and has the ingenuity to parallel that across the type of mundane,unextraordinary lives that ordinary people live. Ferrell shows great restraint in the role as Crick,but really everyone here seems to fit their roles with ease. Even minor parts such as the one friend Crick considers from work(Tony Hale)or the two shrinks who seem helpless in finding the root of his dilemma(Linda HUnt and a hirsute,heavy and unrecognizable Tom Hulce) are added with the right measure. This is a film that may test the patience of more direct,linear film-goers,and the ending(and this as close a spoiler I'm giving)seems to be somewhat of an awkward fit for the way this film builds, but this is arguably a very memorable movie and it somewhat defies an easy description. See it for yourself,and see if you don't agree.",10,2,4,20 January 2007
Jaws," They'll need a bigger boat
","I know it's been said before,but it really does bear the truth:this film is pretty much the granddaddy of 'Summer blockbusters'. I am not old enough to recall movies or the summer movie season prior to 1975,so I suppose I have to trust the voracity of that contention. The story's pretty familiar by now: around and about the 4th of July weekend in the New England beach town of Amity,a shark is killing unsuspecting swimmers along the coastline. Enter Sheriff Martin Brody(Roy Scheider),who with his family has freshly relocated from New York. He's not fond of the water and,to his great chagrin,the deaths of two swimmers has him running into unforeseen tension with the grinning,business-obsessed Mayor(Murray Hamilton),who doesn't want to close down the beach on the 4th. When Brody's warnings heed another attack,he is sent to find and kill the shark along with an out-of-town marine biologist(Richard Dreyfuss) and a crusty old sea salt named Quint(Robert Shaw). As per any creature feature,the task is going to prove easier said than done.Spielberg may've worked his most deft touches here: the amount of horror and tension here are choice,and,as is the case in his movies since(E.T.,War of the Worlds,to a lesser degree Jurassic Park)the creature of doubt is not revealed until well into the film. Off the top of my head,I don't recall if Peter Benchley wrote the screenplay version of his novel,but whoever did was able to keep the script tight and understated,so as to allow for a normal framing to a menacing situation.Well worth a collection for the cineaste,whether they are into monster/man vs. nature films or not.",9,1,3,9 August 2005
The Wrestler," In a word: Heartbreaking
","The glory days are well past for Randy 'The Ram' Robinson(Mickey Rourke,more on him later),an aging pro wrestler who keeps wrestling long past his prime. Still in good,if not great,shape for a man hitting middle age and having endured countless abuses in his long career,he lives the life of a near hermit,alone in a trailer park barely able to cover rent. His closest friend and/or love interest is a bright,engaging stripper(Marisa Tomei,absolutely captivating once again)who goes by the stage name of Cassidy(real name:Pam).A massive heart attack after a particularly grueling match has the Ram re-evaluating his life,with repercussions that are both sublime and sad.Director Darren Aronofsky seems to like making movies--WHEN he's making them--about people whose lives seem to spiral downward(Requiem for a Dream,this one and,from what I've divined about it,Pi),and this is straight up the description. The Ram is someone who may not be completely lost in his glorious past but one couldn't really blame him ife he were. He is a big,hulking,brooding shell of a man who works hard to NOT be the fighting machine his image is painted to be,being effusive and avuncular to the local kids,magnanimous and gracious to the fans(and really anyone in general),all while slowly dying on the inside. To say Mickey Rourke was able to completely fill this character out to every physically and emotionally painful end would be understatement,but I cannot think of better words to describe it. I don't think it's an understatement to say that his performance truly makes this movie,but it isn't the entirety of it. Using a mostly 'no-name' cast,Aronofsky and screenwriter Robert D.Siegel are able to fuse very routine characters and dialog to everyone,including the three main stars--Rourke,Tomei and Even Rachel Wood(As the largely disaffected and estranged daughter of the main character)and their characters with near seamlessness. Probably should've been an Academy(I believe it was a Golden Globes,among others)consideration for Best Picture,that's no matter anymore. This film walks and talks and does exactly what it aims to do: take you into the sad,heartbreaking life of a proud but broken man and making you feel every iota of that emotion and does it without hardly missing a beat. Would I say it's the best movie of 208? Well,I haven't seen all or probably even most of the movies that have ben released from last year(who has,really?),but I'd have to say this would have to be easily one of the top five. Highly recommended!",10,0,1,14 February 2009
Kingpin," I Haven't laughed THIS hard at the movies too often
","Young Roy Munson has been raised to be a bowler.It's what he does best. In 1979,at the age of eighteen,Roy(Woody Harrelson from here on out)is at the top of his game and a bona-fide star in his Ohio hometown. After he beats Ace pro Ernie'The Big Ern'McCracken(Bill Murray,smarmy and snarkly as ever)in a match,he is raked into Ernie's con game and pays a dear price for it.Seventen years later,Roy is anything but the local hero he once was. He lives in a seedy apartment in small town Pennsylvania,does odd sales jobs and has to 'satisfy' his decrepit landlady to avoid the rent. It's at one of the bowling alleys that Roy does routes to that he witnesses one Ishmael Boorg(Randy Quaid,backing his scene stealing performance in ID4 with this bravura turn),a sweet,gentle Amish man-child who has a natural knack for bowling. Needing money and smelling a chance at scoring big time,Roy decides to take Ishmael under his wing.On the way to a Million dollar tournament in Las Vegas,Roy and Ishmael pick up a comely stowaway and ally in a gangster's moll(VAnessa Angel) and bond from mishap to mishap.There's nothing particularly brilliant or especially sharp about this offering,the second from the brothers Farrelly,but its uniqueness and lack of restraint on the gross-out humor make this movie a very easy watch(for those who love that kind of stuff,of course). Harrelson,Quaid,Murray and Angel move effortlessly through this flick,which may explain why it's so good. Since this film,the Farrellys have steadily moved away from the almost merciless gross-out gags of their films and has made seeing their films a little less riotous and fun,so this movie is a healthy reminder of what a little imagination(I mean,honestly...a movie about Bowling AND the Amish?)and mischief can make. A great cheap rent or cable TV movie.",9,26,36,22 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Strong finish to a epic
","Completing the cycle of Star WArs films is this offering,which offers the last pieces of the puzzle that is the Skywalker family dynasty. Anakin Skywalker's tilt to the dark side,merely hinted in the first two films,becomes plainly evident as this film digs in.If one were looking for something more paced realistically in terms of character development in this movie,one would be a fool. This is MEANT to take leaps in logic,where the once true-hearted Ani(HAyden Christensen,looking more like MArk HAmill here,not a coincidence) becomes so enraged with the force that he goes to the dark side,much to the great horror of his mentor Obi-Wan(Ewan MacGreggor,sounding more like Sir Alec Guiness,also not a coincidence,his relationship with Padme(Natalie Portman,with not much to do,kinda resembling CArrie Fisher,natch)seems to be on the breaking point and the Sith is Marshalling forces to take over the galaxy. Throw in the near-pointless dialog,plenty of CGI crafted dogfight and light saber scenes, Samuel L.Jackson's Mace Windu kicking *ss(and remaining relatively low-key in the process) and Ian McDiarmid adding the right amount of menace as Emperor Palpatine and you have the complete George Lucas offering. A full plate of a summer blockbuster!This film needs no pretenses. It is summer entertainment,pure and simple.",8,2,4,9 August 2005
Ray," An exceptional performance for a semi-exceptional film
","Jamie Fox's performance of Ray Charles is the performance I am referring to. In truth,this movie is a fine film,but just nothing distinguishable in and of itself.Director Taylor Hackford(An Officer and a Gentleman)co-wrote this film with James White,which is best described as a partial,apocryphal bio-pic,where it covers MOST of Ray's life,capturing the elements of his career and relationships that defined him. From his youngest,sighted memories as a poor kid growing up in rural Northern Florida,one of the last of those memories was watching his brother drown to death,to his rise to fame as a musician,topping off with his refusal to play a concert in segregated Georgia,which got him banned from the state for about seventeen years. Good,solid supporting performances by Kerry WAshington(as Ray's wife Della),Regina King(as MArgie Hendricks,the back-up singer Ray would have n affair and a child with),Harry Lennix(as Ray's chief promoter),Bokeem Woodbine(as FAthead Newman,who would become Ray's chief collaborator in music for decades),Aunjanue Ellis(as one of Ray's other back-up singers,the Rayettes) and Curtis Armstrong(almost unrecognizable as Ray's first record contract,who would end up being his longtime friend) among others are able to frame this film just fine. Really,this film is all about,and all around Ray and Jamie Fox's tribute to it,and he does it Perfectly. While the Oscars(and any other awards for that matter,I suppose)can have their moments of inaccuracy in doling out awards,Fox's Best Actor win was spot on,and well worth viewing this movie.",8,1,2,23 April 2006
The Lion King," Probably not fair to say that it went downhill from here for Disney animation but...
","...it seems suffice to say that Disney's non-computer animation would never quite be this flush with success and critical acclaim ever again. One could argue that Pocohantas or Mulan were at least reasonably well-made offerings,or that Tarzan,Hunchback of Notre Dame or Hercules were commercially successful(if perhaps uninspired treatments of much darker material),but still it wouldn't be able to blunt the fact that after THe Lion KIng,Disney animation was bound to disappoint,with films being cranked out more frequently,the onset of PIXAR and passable animation from 20th Century-Fox and Dreamworks. helped basically push Disney out of the top spot as full-length animation King.The story is fairly well-known by now I thi9nk,but in case you weren't aware of this gem before,here goes: playful lion cub Simba(voiced by Jonathan Taylor THomas),whose is destined to be the next king of the jungle,lets his curiosity and gullibility get the best of him--due in no small part to the vile scheming of his evil Uncle Scar(voiced fantastically by Jeremy Irons)--and becomes unwittingly involved in Scar's plot to do away with his brother,the King Mufasa(Voice of none-better,JAmes EArl Jones). When he runs away away from the wild-lands due to guilt,he is adopted by a carefree odd-couple named Timon,a meerkat(voice of Nathan Lane,who can do more with voice expression alone than some actors can do with their whole bodies) and Pumba,a warthog(voiced by under-appreciated character actor Ernie Sabella). He grows up under their care(and gains the voice of Matthew Broderick) and plans to stay worry-free and happy until fate crosses him with his childhood friend NAla(voice of Moira Kelly).Bouncy musical numbers from Elton John and Tim Rice,a nice, gentle,humored script by Irene Mecchi and Jonathan Roberts and directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff make this animated film more than a kid-friendly treatment of Hamlet. (If memory serves,I believe Mr.Minkoff went on to direct and/or produce the Broadway production as well) The musical numbers may be approaching saccharine sweet and the plot and characters may seem all too familiar now,but it's still quality entertainment,pure and simple. While the enjoyment or entertainment value of Disney animation may vary from person-to-person,it's tough to argue that in a five-year,four movie span(The Little Mermaid,Beauty and the Beast,Aladdin and this film)the strength and vitality of the storied Mouse franchise.",9,0,0,7 April 2006
Lord of War," Squirm-inducing,downward spiraling morality tale
","Early on in this film,you know exactly who and what Yuri Orlov(Nicolas Cage,brilliant as actor and narrator)is. It's the how and where that he's about to show you.Yuri is an arms dealer. An independent one at that. When he started in the business as a dealer in the early-to-middle eighties,he is very much a small-timer,a little fish in an ocean that is populated by mostly large nations and rogue militaries. He still manages to find stashes and sell,but usually to fringe groups and drug-dealers. Whne the fall of the Soviet Union occurs(over a period of time spanning 1989 to 1992),this opens up business for Yuri. Now,with huge stashes of guns,grenades,bombs,aircraft and tanks left behind from the Cold War,provided by family connections in his family's home country of Ukraine,he becomes a highly coveted deal broker in weapons,coveted by governments large and small.He is also a tragic figure:a little man who felt insignificant growing up in Little Odessa in New York. He worked at his family's restaurant along with his wild,irrepressible younger brother Vitaly(Jared Leto,melding his musician instincts into this character) before witnessing a mob hit which impressed upon him the belief that the world is always looking for someone to supply them weapons,hence his career path. He is also smitten with the most popular girl from the neighborhood(Bridget Moynahan,beautiful and just a hint oblivious)who goes off to become a model. Once his biz takes off,he is able to put his family up,get his brother in on the business and sweep the girl of his dreams off her feet,marry her and start a family.Naturally,when someone deals in unholy alliances,the Devil comes back for his pay,and Yuri is about to slowly but surely pay that price.Smartly written and never underestimating the intelligence of its audience,this movie,penned and directed by Andrew Niccol,gives you a picture that is rarely(if ever)pretty and quite damning by its path. Interwoven in this story are(among others) the incorruptible Interpol agent(Ehtan HAwke),the rare independent gun-runner(Ian Holm)whose business clashes with Yuri's and the Liberian dictator(Eamonn Walker,very strong here)who has somehow managed to get into Yuri's head and knows how to push his buttons. The film traces Yuri's path from confident,cool and self-deluding businessman to a soul-challenged interloper who leads a double-life on borrowed time. Cage's voice is perfect as narrator,and director Niccol intersperses the tale being told with a few choice narrative cut-aways,lending a sort of surreal sense of the story.It is a story of violence and moral weakness,and judging from the people who've backed and/or put their names on this film(among them Cage himself co-produces and the show is endorsed by,among others,Amnesty International)there is a sense of conviction behind it. The commitment here really shows,and that is why it works.",9,2,4,7 August 2006
WALL·E," I keep waiting for PIXAR to let me down;alas,it hasn't happened yet
","I've seen practically all of the PIXAR productions for the big screen,and I am drawn to them for the exact reason that I'm convinced that,sooner or later,they will fail me:namely,beautifully crafted imagery and stories with memorable characters and the belief that they will,in their lack of uniformity or decreasing inspiration,become disappointing.It hasn't happened yet,and in fact this may've been an up-tick.The title character,a garbage collecting drone,has spent seven centuries performing the lonely and depressing task of cleaning up the unimaginably voluminous waste left behind by a futuristic mankind that has been consuming cheaper and cheaper materials and disposing them at an inequitable rate. As Earth has become uninhabitable due to this accumulation,there is precious little able to function in this world(save the cockroaches,of course),but this does not,somehow stifle WALL-E's ability to gradually become sentient,developing thoughts,emotions and longings that he doesn't fully understand but is oh-so-familiar with. His encounter with a exploratory droid named EVE will not only change his destiny but will create a ripple effect on the world he's been(and mankind's descendants have not been) familiar with.Director Andrew Staunton is more like the team project leader on a large-scale animation project that defies description. Very limited voice-work(with choice cameos by KAthy Najimy and PIXAR reg JOhn Ratzenberger to back Jeff GArlin's turn as the captain of a traveling space habitat)is able to fill in mostly gaps where the robots cannot fill,which isn't much.I won't go into which PIXAR films are my favorites and which aren't,but suffice it to say that even the weakest of their creations is still some of the best animation out there and could stand up against even some NON-animated films out there. This has an appeal that can stretch generations and a quality that is unique despite any of its flaws(i.e. preachines,cute,hidden agendas and standard 'happy ending' canards you find in animated films,PIXAR or no). And while I feel like PIXAR's next offering may be the one to finally really disappoint,after this film,it wouldn't surprise me if it didn't.",9,2,5,4 July 2008
The Good Shepherd," Open to plenty of analysis
","Director(and co-star)Robert DeNiro and writer Eric Roth patch together this dry and chilling story of the CIA,as illustrated through the adult life of a fictionalized son of power and privilege,whose sacrifices become as murky and unsavory as the actual world political situation of which he tries to navigate through.Edward Bell Wilson(Matt Damon,opting to lean this time toward playing a stiff,ambiguous and stoic character for whom his actions spell out MUCH more about him than his words),was all about devotion to something larger than himself. Whether it was his family(particularly his disgraced Wilson-era cabinet father or his separated but very much in mind son),his friends in college,his organization--the legendary 'Skull and Bones'--,his job and--particularly in his own mind--his country. As his job takes him from Post WWII--damaged Europe of the late 1940s through the heightened Cold War tensions of the early 1960s,we see Wilson make his deals,uncover spies,thieves,double agents and discover what kind of evil he's wrangled with on his way to becoming the top man in a burgeoning element of the American rise in Global power:namely,counterintelligence.Damon is about what you'd expect out of the character he's been assigned to limn: an Ivy-league educated,WASPy,pre-baby boomer who is as over-whelmed by the changing world identity as he is knee-deep in the middle of trying to alter and manipulate it. JOhn Turturro is particularly effective and even a little scary as Wilson's chief deputy,a quietly efficient and effective military man who seems to unquestioningly go about doing his job,and solid turns by Oleg Stefan(as Wilson's chief contact and counterpart in the KGB),Billy Crudup(as Wilson's nearly adversarial peer),William Hurt(as the agency mucky-muck who may or may not be on the take),JOe Pesci(as the of Italian-American organized crime,caught pants-down in Castro's nets,Tammy Blanchard(as Wilson's deaf,innocent college sweetheart)and Angelina JOlie(as Wilson's equally blue-blooded wife,who comes to greatly rue the fact that she got swept into her husband's world of quiet deceit). A lot of characters come and go through this world,but as Wilson quietly(And eventually dis-quietingly)goes about his business,they seem to become background to greater goals and missions,sometimes not at all what they seem.As stated earlier,there's plenty of analysis to be applied here,all the way up(or down)to the very title itself. While this movie tends to drag and the technical and chronological elements of the film tend to blur and get fudged a little(the way they age Damon and Jolie in this film is uneven at best,unconvincing at worst),it is still something of a 'must-see' for people who take ANY interest in world affairs,semi-recent history,intergovernmental agencies and politics(and I would count myself among them). En Toto,an effective,disturbing and intriguing film offering with much to say and muted,intelligent ways of saying it.",8,3,6,24 April 2007
The Queen," Think You know the Royal family? Think again.
","Anybody who is old enough to remember when Princess Diana of Wales,along with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed(spelling?) and one of their bodyguards were killed knows that,besides the world and popular outpouring of sympathy and grief over the tragedy out-poured in the days after,there was plenty of recrimination from the media as well as the public,and the massive majority of it went toward the House of Windsor.This story,which covers exactly the seven days afterwords,mostly from the perspective of the Royal family and the Prime MInister--still newly elected Tony Blair(Michael Sheen,very well-cast)--and his office,spliced with coverage snippets from news reels and media footage,gives you a wide range of emotion and perspective. Credit the screenplay and writer Peter Morgan,as well as Stephen Frears' direction with turning this film into more than a mere walk-through of familiar events,replete with emotion and instead a thought-provoking and balanced look at the often-maligned monarchy,particularly through the eyes of the figurehead Queen Elizabeth II(Helen Mirren,EVERY bit the part). She may be a steely,tough and perceivably dour sovereign,but she is very much the product of both her upbringing AND history,and she is also not unaware of how her people see her,and this conflict is quietly raging as the preparations for Diana's funeral ensue. Anchored by Mirren's Oscar-winning(and worthy)performance,this simple yet intriguing movie runs at a somewhat surprisingly fast clip(just over an hour and forty minutes)is able to leave mark. While it may seem like Mirren's Queen is all that this show is about,watching this will show you much more.",9,0,1,3 February 2008
Blow," The Descent of George Jung
","Jung(Johnny Depp--is there any role he CAN'T play?)is basically a kid from working class Boston who,while away in college,discovers that selling drugs pays good. VERY good. And as he moves from selling dime bags of marijuana to larger amounts of the stuff,he discovers that cocaine sells to even richer clientèle,so he moves into that Emmatrade.Over the span of just over twenty years,George goes from being small-time dealer to major trafficker,and as he does,he moves up and back down the financial scale. Make no mistake about it,though,the movement of his soul is steadily only going down.A somber,un-romanticized story of a life of crime told through first-person narration,this film,directed by Ted Demme off a screenplay by David McKenna(from a book by Bruce Porter),is told matter-of-fact,thus enhancing the element of unsettling reality(or,put another way,it gives off the all-too-subtle insinuation that if someone as ostensibly normal as this guy could end up being a morally decayed merchant of addiction and death,then maybe so could ANYONE.). The supporting cast is mostly transitory,as many friends,associates and acquaintances move through George's life,with the major exceptions being his parents:his hard-working,easy-going dad(Ray Liotta,touching),who loves his son dearly and is noticeably powerless in helping him,his mom(RAchel Griffiths),an easily hurt woman whose desire to see her financial/family situation improve is blunted by her shame in her son's avocation,his wife(Penelope Cruz),who is mostly only into him because of his money,his innocent daughter(Emma Roberts as a child,Jaime King as an adult) and the business associates(Paul Reubens--excellent,as the wiry,erratic hair-stylist who hooks Jung up initially--and Ethan Suplee,pre-'My Name is Earl'),who also end up deserting him at one point or another.The appeal of this show may be kind of limited,since its portrayal of drug crime is much less about the 'sex and violence' than it is about the general loss of soul and character,but to me,this would be(I'm guessing)much closer to the real breakdown as to how dealers end up being created:namely,namely as misguided businessmen who realize that they're dealing in something damning and destructive(if they ever realize it at all!). Probably more of a choice of viewers who are fans of any of the principals(mostly Depp,but also to lesser effect Liotta,Cruz,Reubens or Max Perlich,who plays one of Jung's friends from the old neighborhood),that seems like a shame,because this movie is a fine example of thoughtful,dark film-making.",9,1,2,11 November 2007

","Bitter,cynical and faithless novelist Mike Enslin(John Cusack,getting all the opportunity in the world to use his acting chops here)ignores any implorements or entreaties to avoid the titular room--made mostly by the consummate professional manager(Samuel L.Jackson,not yelling once!)--which menaces an otherwise rustic and charming New York City hotel. From the mere viewing of the trailer,you can tell that said novelist is about to have his mind forcibly changed.An effective,if perhaps forced and puzzling,thriller that has much of the earmarks of a Stephen King tome,which makes sense since this is based off a short story by the horror master. Director Mikael Hafstrom is not shy about using physical special effects(As opposed to CGI) to make the terror as tangible as possible. The buffering support plot lines--Enslin's crumbled marriage to Lily(MAry McCormack),which was sped along by the terminal illness of their only child(Jasmine Jessica Anthony),and his broken relationship with his dad(Len Cariou)--does add depth to the story,but(and I hope to not give anything away here)doesn't give much satisfaction to the payoff. Also,the show(And perhaps this is the fault of the source material)gives SO much personality to the room(hence the summary line)that the side trips into Enslin's psyche seem to be little more than sacrificial offering for the rest of the film.As said before,effective(read=creepy and scary to precision)but somewhat unsatisfying. Outside of Cusack and to a lesser degree McCormack,this is not much of a showcase for the actors involved,and the pattern of this movie's denouement will no doubt leave a viewer or two scratching their heads. This is pretty much(save the nice windscreen effect)a renter.",7,0,0,5 June 2008
Shrek," Fractured fairy tale that found an audience
","It's actually kind of amazing that this movie and the book it was based off of was actually sitting on a movie studio shelf for some years. If I remember correctly,the idea to make Shrek,a surprise 1990 children's best-seller by William Steig,was considered as far back as 1994,but was shelved for reasons that you usually hear applied to films that end up often being huge successes(i.e. 'who wants to see a movie about...?' and 'nobody likes such-and-such type of movie'). Finally,when Spielberg-Katzenberg-Guber decided to pick it up(you might know them better as Dreamworks LLC),they assembled screenwriters Ted Elliott,Terry Rossio,Joe Stillson,Roger Schulman,Cody Cameron,CHris Miller and Conrad Vernon,and crafted a movie. With only the moderate(well,for a Spielberg-produced movie moderate)fanfare,Shrek came out in 2001. The rest,as they say,is movie history.The story is pretty well established and almost ad-rigeur. The travails of gruff-but-likable realistic ogre Shrek(Mike Myers in a modulation of the 'Mad Scotsman' character he's used before),Donkey(Eddie Murphy in full,scene-stealing wise-ass mode)and Princess Fiona(CAmeron Diaz,easily lost,here)as they are bound to cross horns with the scheming Prince Fahrquar(John Lithgow),a Napoleon-complex inflicted royal,over the fate of the forest kingdom of Far Far Away LAnd and the swamplands(i.e.Shrek's home)are both something of wistful storytelling and current,quasi-postmodern irony and hipness. Kids and adults alike warmed up to this film and rightly so. The sequels would reach mixed reactions overall--the second would do somewhat better critically and much better financially,the third,which I haven't see yet but plan to,had grossed well but has received a much less favorable reaction from critics and many viewers alike--but would create a cottage franchise for film that isn't done continuing a rolling story(if I'm not mistaken,I believe a fourth Shrek is in the can already!). Here comes a true 'duh!' statement of this review,but here goers:this is one unique film that is a true keeper.Perfect example of how sometimes it takes time for a unique story to find an audience.",9,0,1,30 July 2007
Iron Man," Strong early summer entrant(not to mention a lot of fun)
","My bias in Superhero Comic characters made into movies sides mostly with DC,so my familiarity with a fair amount of the Marvel world is somewhat light. Particularly with Iron Man,so my learning curve on this show was in one part helped by a friend of mine who IS a MArvel fanatic and in another--a much bigger one--in this movie.I'd say I did okay in that regard. Better than OK.The transformation of debauchery-loving rich kid/gifted inventor and demi-genius Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.,fantastic!) from cynical war profiteer to wounded crusader on a mission(via his creation and film's namesake,of course)is somewhat of a slow one,as he survives a kidnap attempt in Afghanistan and has to use his smarts and the equipment he's given to escape,not to mention the help of a equally gifted translator(Shaun Taub,underrated),but that's okay. Downey's arch,oh-so-real acting and perfectly glib persona makes his reform interesting and even fun to watch so that by the time the finished version of Stark's creation comes to fruition,it doesn't seem like much of a wait at all IMHO. With the help of his loyal and attractive(also attracted)assistant Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow,someone I'd sorta forgotten how luminescent and lovely she really can be before seeing this movie),he strives to use his nascent technology for good rather than evil,which naturally will incur resistance from within.Great supporting turns by Terence Howard as Tony's associate and erstwhile friend,Jeff Bridges as Tony's mentor and potentially shadowy menace and Clark Gregg as a tight-lipped fed make director Jon FAvreau's job helming this adaptation a HUGELY better result than the wan,flavorless 'DareDevil' from 2003. THis is a satisfying film from at least three levels: for those who love superhero movies,it's great;for those who enjoy a good message movie,it's only BARELY preachy and always able to keep it frenetic and true;and as a summer film,it's large and captivating,never letting the viewer go till the credits(and perhaps even STILL during that)! While I cannot quite go all the way with a ten for this film,it's a very strong nine. A strong movie-going experience for most anyone who likes 'Summer' films.",9,1,2,13 May 2008
Space Jam," Judge it on its own merit and it's quite good
","Some of the complaints of this film,if I recall correctly,was that it seemed to skimp on the Looney Tunes characters,added characters that weren't of any great likability or memorability and seemed to make Michael Jordan into a sort of caricature/parody of himself. And while I suppose this movie doesn't seem particularly true to either the element of animation or to MJ(though,I'd say,between the two,Jordan comes away as the winner and I'll explain why),this still is a perfectly good piece of entertainment for the whole family.Aliens come to earth seeming innocuous enough(they measure in inches) but they have a less-than honorable mission:they want to take the Looney Tunes characters back to their planet and make them into something just above slaves for their entertainment. Bugs Buny,infinitely confident,challenges the critters to a game of basketball. They respond by siphoning the talents of five of the top players of the day(PAtrick Ewing,Tyrone 'Mugsy'Bogues,Charles BArkley,Shawn Bradley and Larry Johnson. What?! No Scottie Pippen??). To counterbalance this,Bugs and company turn to his old Nike commercial-making days,and the battle is on.To me,this movie succeeds on it's own merit,and this could be no better demonstrated than by the co-star himself. Jordan plays nobody but himself,and his un-forced sense reaction to the situations actually works well to balance the zaniness around him. An almost un-credited cameo by Bill Murray just about steals the movie. All the familiar characters from the universe of WArner Toons are along for the ride,plus some new ones(a sexy,girl cager rabbit name Lola,as well as the globby aliens,led by a cigar-chomping boss voiced by Danny DeVito)to lend their various talents(Daffy Duck's neuroses are particularly enjoyable)and while this is hardly the best work of animation here(Mel Blanc's invaluable voice is missed,of course),this still works. THe live-action characters seem to be compromised some--THeresa Randle as Michael's wife and Wayne KNight as his harried manager come to mind--but that seems to be a fairly minor crime for a film that aims to be as big,bold,fanciful and childlike as possible. I don't think you need to be a fan of Looney Tunes or necessarily know that much about pro basketball(in fact,it might help!)to enjoy this film,just an ability to appreciate this rarefied blend of familiar animation with commercial savvy.",8,3,4,1 December 2007
Before Sunrise," Maybe you DON'T need to love,even like chatty movies to appreciate this...
","...but it might improve your enjoyment.HAving said that,I think that this is a film for anyone who appreciates character over plot and wants a film to respect his or her ability to follow a story. Jesse(Ethan Hawke in a roll where,to me,he became A LOT more likable),a college student on vacation(more of a wanderlust)in Europe meets,via chance encounter,Celine(Julie Delpy,ethereal,beautiful and bright),a French student also on roam. They hit it off instantly,stop off in Vienna on wait for each others' trains taking them in different directions,and spend a thoughtful,chatty evening-into-overnight-into-morning together,taking in the aged,beautiful scenery of the old German city. As they bond over their conversation,an attraction builds,but then a dilemma ensues:should they indulge in a physical relationship,fully aware of the fact that once they part they may never see each other again? Decisions,decisions...Director Richard Linklater,to the best of my knowledge,had never filmed a movie outside of his home state of Texas(and mostly Austin)prior to this offering,but his slow-moving,attentive camera and sound are able to capture much of the beauty and warmth of old Europe and the people who roam the streets as well as the central characters. Some may dismiss this as a 'Date movie' or a 'Chick flick',but to me,this film is FAR above either of these genres:this is a romance that's made around real,human character,that has no easy answers and no clean lines of plot denouement. I have,I must confess,some fond memories of seeing this. I was back in college,and my school's arts,entertainment and activities organization(I think most colleges have one)had agreed,through its films department,to screen films not yet released to local(read:mostly students)audiences,with the admission to the screenings being free. Previously,we'd screened films like 'Trapped in Paradise'(bad)and 'Mixed Nuts'(very bad)and I felt like we'd gotten what we'd paid for. This was next up,and it was like a revelation: a free,thoughtfully,well-made large studio production that I(and about two hundred other lucky sorts)got to see for free! I can say that whether you pay for it(And as a twelve-year old movie,it can't be more than a cheap rent anymore)or see it for(almost)free on cable,you'll be getting high quality. All that's left is you,the viewer,and your ability to enjoy it.",10,1,3,20 July 2007
Munich," Not as simple as 'Israel is wrong'or vice-versa
","I recall reading in columnist Ann Coulter's Academy Awards article(not really sure why she decided to cover the awards,given her very public contempt for actors and awards,but anyway...),she boiled down the concept behind Oscar nominee Munich as 'Israel is wrong'. From seeing this movie,I can clearly tell she's not seen this film,or if she has she was there to cherry-pick this for the kind of things she didn't want to see or hear. I'm sure she's not alone out there,but these people are missing the point of this film.This film account of the book(whose title and author eludes me at the moment),co-written by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth,tells of the Israeli backed(though NOT officially recognized by the state)mission to find and kill the people responsible for the kidnapping and killing of twelve Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich(hence the title). The group is led by Avner Kaufmann(Eric Bana,very good here,as he was in the Hulk and Troy),the son of a national hero who is a star agent of the Moussad(spelling?). His team of agents are sent by fiat of PM Golda Meir(Lynn Cohen) herself and is authorized by a fellow Mossad commander named Ephraim(Geoffrey Rush) to go about their missions.Over the course of about eight months,Avner and his five transverse Europe looking for and executing each person for whom they are able to get a hold of,with each mission becoming a little more dangerous and each target becoming more murky. As Avner comes closer and closer to finding the main Palestinian who headed(or financed)the Olympic kidnapping,the endeavor becomes much more dangerous and Avner starts having his doubts about the effectiveness and purpose of his mission.Dripping in moral quandaries,this movie starts as an anatomy of a national call for vengeance and justice and ends as...well,something different. I don't think I'm giving away anything by saying that this film shows that revenge is not nearly as simple,easy or clear as it seems.With fantastic supporting performances by Daniel Craig(the future JAmes Bond!),Ayalet Zurer(As Avner's pretty,worried wife and new mother),Ciaran Hinds,Mathieu Kassowitz(both as members of the group),Cohne,Rush,Michael Lonsdael and Mathieu Aralic(as,respectively,the father of the info broker and the broker himself,who supply Avner their info as to whom to kill)among others,this movie is a searing,heart-tugging film. As per Spielberg,there is no skimping on emotional spark-plug moments,and plenty of the images here will stick with you long after you've seen them. This film doesn't pretend to have the answers about the violence in the Middle East,it is merely showing that in one instance of violence and tragedy,the way a nation responds can sometimes complicate or even make worse to some degrees,the situation. Nobody here is really wrong or right,just unable to break the chain of violence that has become synonymous with the region. Anyone who simplifies the situation,or this movie,doesn't get it or the film.",9,4,6,13 August 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Changing the face of horror
","There have been many periods of film release that have had impact on film history(think 'Wizard of Oz','It Happened One Night' and 'Gone With the Wind' in 1939 or 'Close Encounters' and 'Star Wars' in the Summer of 1977,for examples),but one that comes to mind for me was one particular month:November,1984. That's when two somewhat under-budgeted films,James CAmeron's 'The Terminator'(which would catapult then-cult figure Arnold Scwarzenegger to super-stardom) and this film,Wes Craven's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'. Both central characters,the eponymous Terminator and 'Nightmare' menace Freddy Krueger would become iconic film images for decades to come.The plot line of the story's no government secret here: a handful of high schoolers in a seemingly ordinary town in Ohio are being haunted in their dreams by a grotesque figure. When this figure starts murdering each one of the group,it's up to Nancy(Heather Langenkamp),the most stable and level of the group,to ferret out and end the terror. Robert Englund,previously known from supporting character roles and his touching,gentle alien in the 'V' mini-series and t.v.series,is able to develop a nearly permanent career as the seemingly indominable child-killer. Wes Craven would redefine his own career,as well as the slasher genre,with this film,where he had previously been known for visceral,uncomfortable shockers like 'LAst House on the Left' and 'The Hills HAve Eyes'.Definitely worth a look,especially for those who consider themselves horror film buffs.",8,9,10,19 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Beginning...that wasn't.
","Even though I am old enough to have gone and seen the Star Wars movies(or,rather,had my parents take me to see it)when it was first released,I was rather slow about getting into the genre until much later. I don't think I even got around to seeing all three films until I was in college. Most people(I am assuming)know the general crux of this film,so I'll spare the plot summery here. This movie is,for all of its technical flash(for 1977),strum and drang is basically a Western/Actioner serial that is set in space with slight shadings of adult savvy,mixed with kid-like enthusiasm. Creator/Director George Lucas cannot be credited enough with bringing to life a cultural phenomenon that can match Star Trek for the level of adoration and emulation. The actors involved(even mega star Harrison Ford) seem secondary to the story,effects and world,but that is something that cannot be oversold in a business where actors and images seem to exceed the value of their roles or the movies they do oftentimes.At the risk of seeming really,REALLY clichéd and trite:yes,I,too believe this movie is an INSTANT classic.",9,0,1,22 May 2005
300," About what I thought a film version of a graphic novel SHOULD be,particularly one set in ancient Greece.
","My knowledge of Greek history is a little fuzzier now than in the past,but if I recall right,the Spartans were quite the intense,warlike people,with an immense sense of personal pride,loyalty and honor to their fellow Greeks and themselves. So when an emissary for the Persian King and conqueror Xerxes arrives at the palace of Spartan KIng Leonidas(Gerard Butler,quickly making people forget he was the Pahntom of the Opera),making a grand and patronizing offer of peacefully conquering the Spartan(And in effect all of Greece)in exchange for allegiance and servitude,the Spartan KIng does not take this very kindly. He not-so-subtly offers his reply,and before long,he is rounding up soldiers and planning to take on the oncoming onslaught of Persian soldiers(numbering anywhere from the tens of thousands to,as one account would say,millions)that would follow. He meets resistance from many in the Greek council,particularly from the foreign emissary Theron(Dominic West)and gets no support from the arbiters of the country,a vile collection of inbreds named the Ephors,who consult through Oracles--basically young,attractive women who are drugged into mystic spells and incantations. His most powerful support lies in his strong,attractive wife Gorgo(Lena Headey) and,of course,the three-hundred soldiers he assembles for what is understood to be more of a suicide mission to save the country.Director ZAck Snyder,incorporating plenty of the gory energy that was fraught in his 2004 offering Dawn of the Dead,puts this Frank Miller graphic novel to screen in a mostly digitalized,eye-busting creation. MUch of this film takes place about the way that one would expect an ancient Greek story would:told in almost lyrical narrative,foreboding and larger-than-life. To me,this is something of a throwback movie,a film that hearkens back to the days when adventure and narrative was more important and nuance and acting was an afterthought at best. While this is hardly(outside of the technology employed here,much like the equally visually astounding Sin City,also a MIller graphic novel)revolutionary film-making,this is a very good example of what sit-in-the-theater,popcorn-munching entertainment is all about.",9,2,6,31 March 2007
Pineapple Express," Felt like I got a contact high off this
","Jovial,responsible twenty-something Dale Denton(Seth Rogen,maybe at his best here in yet another co-penned story)works his day job as a process server,and 'greases the rails' with his regular use of marijuana. His habit is so strong that he's developed a relationship--indeed,possibly his best friendship--with Saul(JAmes Franco,unrecognizable in his 'Spicoli,the Next Generation'),the affable and perpetually high supplier. That might explain why he B-lines his way to Saul's when he witnesses a seedy pot supplier whacking a rival's hit man and gets spotted in the process.A movie that has to be seen to believed, I gotta say right off the top that you don't really NEED to be a pot user to enjoy this movie,but it probably wouldn't hurt. One part buddy comedy,one part action movie and one part anthemic stoner film(rivaling anything that Cheech and Chong cranked out over their illustrious career),this movie's greatest strength is the fact that the actions and dialog REALLY SOUNDS like stoners: easygoing and intuitive one minute,confused and discombobulated the next. Among the tough to swallow inconsistencies in this film(most of which are easy to ignore given the pacing,likable characters and otherwise smart plotting)is the fact that while Dale and Saul are both heavy hashish users,DAle seems to be A LOT less affected by the ganja than Saul. Another might be the fact that DAle's love life comes in the form of seemingly normal and well-scrubbed teen(Amber Heard,well-scrubbed and sexy and,I'm guessing NOT a teen anymore)whose parents don't seem to have ANY misgivings about an older guy(or the movie is not very clear if they know or not). Nevertheless,the movie roars along in only the way a stoner buddy pic could,and does it without seeming too much in a cloud of its own chronic.Credit director David Gordon Green and the writers for all of this accomplishment. Having GAry Cole(as the chief baddie,aforementioned),Rosie Perez(more one-note as the police arm of Cole's operation,but still effective)and DAnny Roberts(as a rival dealer who is more friend than foe to DAle and Saul)added into the cast rounds the players out well. It's a very cool movie,and maybe I got a little too enthralled by this film while watching,but I could swear that this movie about gave me a contact high. HAving lived next to tokers(but not having done much of the stuff myself),I think I know what that feels like. This film may not get busted or cause any direct Marijuana effects,but I dare anyone who sees this film and,if they liked it,to NOT feel like they got a buzz.

Monty Python and the Holy Grail," All you need is a high tolerance for the absurd
","The Monty Python comedy troupe,fresh off their success in England with their t.v. series 'Flying Circus' decided to pool their talents to film,hoping to broaden their appeal to the states. Around this time,their series would get syndicated and broadcast on PBS,which allowed for a steadily growing cult status among us Yanks,particularly with college students. It's tough to say which,the series or this movie,salted the troupe's status as cult faves here,but they both seemed to be of equal parts effective.King Arthur is on his quest to find the Holy Grail and as he gains knights to attend to his quest,he also finds various obstacles along the way. The cheapness of this movie,coupled with the Pythonesque sense of silliness,fills in the rest of the way here.One who sees this movie must be forewarned: this movie will only truly appeal to those who are willing to throw out their sense of a linear plot in favor of an almost sketch-comedy sensibility. There will be some that may find this film annoying,and that's probably what the creators thought was going to happen anyway. Those who DO appreciate the kind of loose-ended comedy(or people who just are aficionado's of comedy in general) will in all likelihood,truly appreciate this film and will try to commit the various lines made famous to memory.

Sin City," When you marry film noir with comic-book action,you get this.
","This might be one of the more unique film experiences one will have this year. I say that because the movie,which is rife with all the conventions of the Quentin Tarrantino/Robert Rodriguez genre,has one major distinction about it:It is entirely filmed inside of a green-screened sound-stage in Texas.The title summary is about the best way to describe it: It is a combination of very retro styles,combined with more current sensibilities(i.e.full frontal-nudity,explicit violence,quirky dialogue). There are so many name actors in this film that one almost would be led to believe that the producers and directors of the film were lacking confidence in how it would stand on its own merits. One would be wrong however. The acting in this film,primarily Bruce Willis as Hartigan,the single-minded,hardened cop,Mickey Rourke as MArv,the grizzled violent beast of a man who knows he is being unjustly framed for a murder of someone he loved(albeit briefly),Clive Owen as Dwight,an ex-con who seems to have more conscience than the cops or even the prostitutes he has sworn to protect,Rosario Dawson as Gail,the unofficial leader of the prostitutes who becomes Dwight's lover,and Jessica Alba as NAncy,the 'skinny,bookish girl'whom HArtigan saved before and must save again from a deranged killer. These five give very stirring performances to back up the cash value of the superb art direction,clever storytelling and nifty use of violence to accent this offering from Rodriguez and graphic novel creator and co-director Frank Miller.I must warn people that this film is NOT for everyone.I know that phrase is bandied about with many movies,but this movie is almost a definitive of that phrase,as the themes and images of this movie are most certainly unsettle anyone with no taste or patience for their entertainment being both rugged and cartoonish simultaneously. But I don't mind that element of a movie at all,so long as it's done right.",9,0,1,6 May 2005
Happy Feet," Wished it had stuck with ONE agenda
","IN my summary,when I say 'agenda',I'm not just speaking in political terms(though that does apply),I'm talking about agenda in the very 'theatrical' sense: in other words,agenda as in what the plot wants to do,where it wants to go,how it wants to go about it and at what speed it will get there. In those regards,this movie,while quite charming and technologically eye-popping,seems to have too much ambition that and a half.The ordinary origins of an Emperor Penguin named Mumble(voiced as an adult by Elijah Wood)wouldn't seem to be a harbinger for his uniqueness. It seems that he cannot do what most of his species can of,namely sing 'Heart Songs' to attract a mate. He can,however,dance,very well in face. It's the polar(no pun intended)opposite of a stat-kept secret that Mumble's talent makes him an oddity and a pariah,and he ends up becoming an outcast,finding solace with a group of smaller penguins(two of whom,including their mystical leader,are voiced by Robin Williams,who appears to be everything lately) on a neighboring ice floe. Away from his own kind,he encounters various dangers as well(starving carnivorous terns,a fearsome leopard seal come to mind),and along the way discovers that a fish problem(i.e.shortage)and the question of aliens/extraterrestrials(which,of course,are actually humans to these species on this corner of the world). With added voice support of Brittany Murphy(probably the best here,as Mumble's would-be love Gloria),Hugh JAckman(as Mumble's father,Memphis),Nicole KIdman(unrecognizable as Mumble's mother Norma Jean),Carlos Alozraqui,Elizabeth DAily(As the baby Mumble),Hugo Weaving and Anthony LaPaglia among others,this movie is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. The message--or rather,messages--here are thus:tolerance of differences is good,superstition/blind faith is no substitute for scientific knowledge,bravery to be individuality yields the best rewards,and human usage of the oceans(in this case,over-fishing)threatens to endanger those who need its resources. Co-dir4ected by George Miller and co-written and co-directed by Warren Coleman,this movie has BIG ambitions and I think that's what hurt it. If it was MERELY a story about a penguin struggling to find his identity and purpose,that would be enough. If this film wanted to be PURELY an environmental message film that would be fine(though maybe a little less marketable to greater audiences.Maybe not),too.But to make this film as broadly 'message'-based(yet,always marketable as possible,don't forget!),I feel like HAppy Feet turns itself into a polarizing movie when it really shouldn't be. As for my personal opinion,it's pretty basic:I overall enjoyed it,but had reservations. I know(from reading many previous reviews)that I am not alone.",7,0,0,2 May 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," Interesting and compelling,but I don't fully buy it
","Jamir(Dev Patel,who should be bracing himself for plenty of work offers here in the states and shortly)has had anything but an easy young life. At eighteen,he's witnessed his mother get killed,his brothers get separated from him and lost contact with a girl who'd become the love of his life AT LEAST twice. He's been beaten,kidnapped,robbed and humiliated in various ways and has had to scrape and scratch for every rupee,pound and rupee as he's made his way to a safe,if perhaps lowly and disrespected ,job at a call center not far from his hometown province in Mumbai.So when he's able to somehow correctly 'guess' his way through the Indian version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' on his way to a fortune(20 million rupees,which I'm guessing would equal about $5 Million American),there is more than a little suspicion and skepticism as to this 'Slumdog''s conquest of the show.Firstly,I have to say I'm probably far more aligned with those who've reviewed this that were NOT in love with this film,and I'll dispense with my reasons first and thusly: this film's central struggle--the boy Jamir's calm,almost mystic and improbably march toward the grad prize on the game show--taxes my own personal suspension of disbelief to the point of snapping. EVERY single one of the questions has a cosmic 'connection' to his life to that point,and his completely uncanny ability to divine the answers through that,while it may make for an interesting,compelling and,yes,romantic story,it leaves a less stock-committed viewer(such as myself)gawed in disbelief through much of it. Also,the pacing of this movie moves in such herky-jerky,stop-and-start patterns that unless a viewer is fully invested in it(which I gather many people have been),then one is either going to be agitated,distracted or even drowsy(as I was,I must confess,at one point)trying to keep up with the weaved or blended story lines.It's most principally in those reasons(plus the decidedly cultural disconnect of the sort of larger-then-life Bollywood style film-making,particularly toward the end,which may be more of a problem of my just not being greatly familiar with rather than any real quality inferiority of the show)that I cannot give better than a decent rating of this film.NOw,that having been said,why I cannot give this movie terrible reviews lie mostly in the fact(hinted in the summary line)that the movie,for all its quirks,inconsistencies and challenges to one's suspension of disbelief,STILL manages to possess human stories and conflicts that really are interesting and compelling. I credit the actors,most notably PAtel,Freida Pinto(as the girl of his dreams,a one-time friend),Saurabh Shukla(As the highly skeptical police Sargent,charged with trying to shake down Jamir when the show gets suspicious and calls the authorities in the middle of taping),Ayush Mohammed Ismail(As young Salim,JAmal's friend),Ayush Mahesh Khedekar(As young Jamir),Rubiana Ali(As a younger LAtika)and Anil Kapoor(as the host of the 'Millionaire'show,a both charismatic and yet potentially shady character)as being the ones who give this show the kind of sympathetic qualities that both salvage it for me and has made it such an emotional fan favorite elsewhere.Director DAnny Boyle,one NOT shy about incorporating dense,jarring,gross and all-around-disturbing images to his movies,does the same here,but is able to temper it with more tender,intimate and humane moments to give it the kind of fanciful,romantic spirit that it so desperately needs to make this film have any chance of walking and talking. While I cannot claim to be a fan of this show,I can appreciate the qualities that it brings. I just cannot say this is the best movie of 2008. Worth a look,however,absolutely.",7,6,8,10 February 2009
The Wedding Singer," Turning point for Mr.Sandler
","Once a believer in true love,carefree singer/musician Robbie Hart(Adam Sandler,revisiting hair of yore)has his world dashed when his fiancée,a shallow and fickle groupie-type(Angela Featherstone)leaves him on their wedding day. Since the sad irony of this comes in the fact that Robbie's main gigs are weddings(hence the title),this crushes him double. He finds comfort(and eventually more)in a pretty,equally idealistic caterer named Julia(Drew Barrymore,all bright and chipper,nearly shed of her once 'bad girl' image). Another whammy:said caterer is to be engaged to a super oily Yuppie type(Matthew Glave). What's a hopeless romantic to do? Wink wink.Set in the 1980s--specifically,a 1985 I barely recognize--this film captures as much pop culture and music from the period as it can. Director Frank Coraci and writer(formerly of SNL,no doubt the inspiration for those endless 'Herlihy Boy' sketches)Tim Herlihy have no shame in making this a tribute/mild parody of the Reagan era. Adam Sandler is the star,both in set-up and in delivery in this film,delivering in my opinion a truly well-rounded and likable character,putting to work his persona and edging down his tendency to go sophomoric in previous efforts such as Billy MAdison or Happy Gilmore(moderately funny movies but about as weighty as fart-tinged helium). He and BArrymore make a likable couple,and this movie makes for easy viewing that can go though multiple viewings. A cheap rent or an easy find on basic cable.",8,1,1,18 December 2008
Back to the Future," GREAT SCOTT...and Great memories!
","HAve you ever had a movie experience from years before(let's use as an arbitrary number,five years or more)that was so vivid,so exhilarating that you could recall what day,time and even things as seemingly easy to forget as the smell and tastes of the popcorn and soda you had at the movie?For me,that was this movie,and I recall seeing it on a Sunday afternoon in July,1985. The noise and visuals were so electric that I enjoyed this film immensely. My only regret about the experience was that I didn't get a chance to redeem the 'Free Pepsi with purchase of large popcorn'discount coupons they were giving out that day!In a pleasant,average California suburb,ordinary teenager MArty McFly(Michael J.Fox,who was a youngish 24 when he filmed this) dreams of being a rock guitarist as he works his way through school,helping out brilliant-but-fringe local scientist Dr.Emmitt Brown(Christopher Lloyd,adding to his wide range of characters). When an unforeseen crisis interrupts Doc Brown's breakthrough time-machine revelation,MArty is thrust into the machine and becomes the unwitting first participant in time-travel. As if that weren't harrowing enough,he's just found a way to break up his younger parents BEFORE they met and now he has to feverishly find some way to get them back together,lest he and his sibs will never be born.If you can suspend some level of disbelief while watching this(and,really,when SHOULDN'T you suspend some disbelief when watching Spielberg/Lucas/Zemekis style of sci-fi films?),this film is as smooth as silk and one fun ride! Besides Fox and Lloyd,Crispin Glover(lovably strange and pathetic as Marty's once and future dad,George),Lea Thompson(cute and vapid as once and future mom Lorraine)and Thomas Wilson(thick-headed bully Biff,who is a lost treasure here,too) are excellent in fleshing out the characters that stick in one's mind regarding this film. Heck,Old MAn Peabody,Goldie Wilson,Jennifer PArker,MArvin Berry(cousin of Chuck)and the persistently bald and serious-as-heart-attack high school principal all add their own flairs in this movies persona. Robert Zemekis parlayed his 'Romancing the Stone' success to create an even larger-than-life action-fantasy-comedy,with help from plenty of sight and sound FX and a hugely energetic soundtrack anchored by Huey Lewis and the News(remember them?). This film isn't just a renter,this is a keeper! Most people with a sense of fun who long for the eighties movies that accented style over dark or haunting substance should definitely buy this one,tape or DVD.",9,4,5,12 March 2006
Jurassic Park," Got better with more viewings
","I recall that when I first saw this film fourteen years ago(in a theater,of course),I was more turned off by the amount of pat,cliché family/action caricature's(i.e. incorruptible,socially challenged expert or experts in field;oily,greedy lawyer;weaselly underling who will sell out anyone for a price;wide-eyed believer and,of course,kids--smart,cute,can-do kids)than I was in love with the impressive visual and sound gr4aphics. It wouldn't be until a couple more viewings of this movie would I come to appreciate the true entertainment value of this film.In case you're not aware of the plot or story,here goes: The opening day of the Costa Rican-located them park 'Jurassic Park',populated with dinosaurs made from fossilized DNA just-found,promises to be a grand event. That is,until someone shuts down the security grid,thus throwing the whole area into chaos. It's up to the pluck of two Paleontologists(Sam Neill and Laura Dern),two kids(Joseph Mazzello and Arianna Richardson),an eccentric but insightful Mathematician(Jeff Goldblum,still the best element of this film or its sequel!),the game warden(Bob Peck) and the PArk's creator,a cheerfully optimistic tycoon(Sir Ricahrd Attenborough) to survive this dilemma. Director Steven Spielberg(who started on Schindler's List soon after this wrapped) doesn't seem to make any pretense as to what he's trying to do here,which,I must confess,is a good thing: He wants to make a fast,furious and eye-catching film that is light on characters or even some elements of logic and heavy on emotional and visual effects.Probably better as a wide-screen,big screen viewing experience,this is still a keeper,particularly of Mr.S's visual style and excess. You may,like me,also come to appreciate this film with more viewings.",7,1,2,4 October 2007
Dodgeball," Dumb? Sure. LMAO Funny? You bet!
","This film I decided to catch primarily because I wasn't sure how long it'd be out in town and we don't have a 'Dollar movie' theatre anymore. Also,I'm sort of a fan of Ben Stiller,so any chance to see him go unleashed in a film is a welcome spectacle. I'd hardly call this a great film by any measure. It's sophomoric and contrived to a fault. The humor certainly isn't for everyone and the plot seems stolen from previous gross-out comedies like 'Kingpin' and :BAseketball'. But the gags are so enthused and rapid-fire that you don't get a chance to dwell on the bad gags for the ones that do work(and quite a few do). Plus, Vince Vaughn's easy,relaxed comic presence counterbalances Stiller's unhinged bodybuilder freak tops out a cast that seems inspired in their playing basically one-note characters. A bonus is watching real-life wife of Stiller,Christine Taylor, having no problem resisting the advances of her husband's character. The celebrity cameos are cleverly inserted and some of the minor characters--most notably Bateman as a dense sports color commentator and Root as a meek member of Vaughn's gym and Dodgeball team--steal their scenes. Bottom line:this is a good,hearty laughfest(for those who appreciate raw,raucous,well-meant humor) that is a good comedy respite or palate-cleanser between summer blockbusters.       7 out of 10 stars.",Null,0,0,18 July 2004
Atonement," Patience may be a necessity here
","This is one of my lower priority Oscar/Golden Globes-nominated movies,as I had no familiarity with the novel and the perception of this film came off as being a 'wispy,English period piece'. Those reasons and also that this was shown in somewhat limited distribution outside of NYC or LA up until closer to the Academy Awards. So with that in mind,I was resigned to seeing this film on DVD and probably long after the Awards had been given out.HAving finally seen this,I can say that while my curiosity was satisfied and I found stuff to like about it,I wasn't as awed or overwhelmed as some whose comments I've skimmed here.The damage done by 13-year-old Briony Tallis(Saorise Ronan,later to be played by Romola Garai)in regards to the relationship between her older sister Cecilia(Keira Knightley)and her prospective boyfriend,a longtime family friend and grounds keeper(James McAvoy)is deep enough to tear the two asunder,right as England is being thrust into World War II. Over the course of the movie,all three principals(and of course,to an extended degree,their friends and other family members)are affected in ways that are both profound and simple.Director Joe Wright paces this movie in a slow,somewhat detached way and,depending on your patience for artsy,disjointed narrative,will either fascinate or frustrate. There is absolutely no hurry to spell out the situations,or for that matter fill in any blanks that the story leaves. To me,it feels kinda like dirty pool being played here:sure,you're drawn in and intrigued,but it seems to string the viewer out and then leave said viewer perhaps confused and even angry by the third act.Beautiful imagery and attention to detail makes this film at least marginally above average. Credit cinematographer Seamus McGarvey and film editor Paul Tothill with that. This movie is certainly a visually intriguing offering,but as overall entertainment,this could be considered a bit of a test,where patience is more than a virtue.",7,1,3,23 May 2008
V for Vendetta," Not your ordinary graphic novel adaptation
","It could also be argued that this is also not your ordinary political dystopian nightmare,too. But this film is a merging of both film styles,which is why it's unique.Set in London,England in the undisclosed future(I believe they aimed for about 2015 or 2020),the world's economic and military power has somehow shifted. A 'great war'that the U.S. started in the past has set into motion various smaller wars and various plagues has weakened America and shifted the balance of power to a new,neo-fascist England.This government is lorded by a choice few cabinet members and the face of the government is represented and headed by one Adam Sutler(John Hurt,once the watched by Big Brother,now doing the watching so to speak),the Lord Chancellor.The rest of the country seems the same:people still go off to their office jobs,kids to school,people drinking their troubles away at the pubs. Everyone seems to be in front of their television sets. But the news and entertainment seem to be all tilted toward the state,with varying degrees of nationalistic froth. Also,the streets of the city are empty at night,due to state-wide curfew and bands of deputized thugs who prowl the area to detain and punish miscreants. Through this setting swoops in V(an athletic Hugo Weaving,who could effectively hide in any crowd due to his work here,as well as the Matrix and LOTR films)who rescues vulnerable and pretty young television P.O. Evie(Natalie Portman,sexy,smart AND sympathetic). From there,V takes the girl under his wing and opens her up to his world(and in essence,to her own).From there,V exacts his revenge on various members of government,past and present,all toward his ultimate piece-de-resistance:a Guy FAwkes day demolition of Big Ben. He is a character who takes to heart the image of Guy Fawkes(for whom the signature mask is modeled)and the ideals and modes of the Count of Monte Cristo to define his motivations,and this fascinates(inevitably)young and seemingly untouched Evie.Hot on V's trail is a police detective(Stephen Rea,sobering)whose pursuit of the terrorist unveils some nasty truths that he nor his partner would seem to be ready to confront,but may have to just the same.Plenty of back-story and a variety of character profiles buttress this film,giving it certainly the LOOK of a graphic novel. Director James McTiegue effectively builds a movie out of what appears to be(I haven't gotten more than a cursory look at the graphic novel)a very dense tome. Andy and Larry Warchowski co-wrote the script off David Lloyd's creation,and there DOES seem to be apparent traits of Matrix(i.e. a hostile future full of overlords and plenty of repressive violence). Supporting cast holds up well,particularly Tim Pigot-Smith (as a vile,government loyalist and toady),Sinead Cusack(as a government employed scientist and coroner,who happens to have a conscience),Roger Allan(a bombastic and Nazi-like patriot and propagandist),NAtasha Wightman(as an otherwise faceless prisoner) and Stephen Fry(as a droll and foolhardy talk show host and local celebrity).This film is,unlike previous g.n. efforts like From Hell,League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,American Splendor(though unlike the previous two,this one seemed to hit better notes than the previous two),a twist of the concept of a sci-fi/action adventure film as a political message in that it seems that the message comes first,the action and dystopic images come in lock-step. Not escapist fare in the least,really,but an intriguing and(I feel)rewarding film all the same.",9,0,1,26 August 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," It's product placement-rific!!!
","A fun(or maybe not-so-fun)game to play when watching this film would be trying to list all of the product placements or ads that are inserted very cleverly into this film. I realize that NASCAR,through which this movie uses for its setting and framing,is rife with advertising(actually,name me a pro sport that ISN'T!),but still,this movie even adds on to the amount of commercials given that fact.Now,about the movie: race-car driver Ricky Bobby(Will Ferrell,who has it in fifth-gear here,pun apt and somewhat intended)has wanted to 'go fast' and 'be first' practically his whole life. He's born to a race-car driving daddy(GAry Cole,who's fantastic here)and,in fact,he is actually given birth to IN the car his daddy is racing to get his mama to get to the hospital. So to say racing is in his blood would be somewhat of a polite understatement.HIs meteoric rise to NASCAR stardom is one that starts as a pit crew member who fills in for the decidedly UN-successful driver who quits in the middle of a race to relieve himself(and get lunch,of course),races the team back to respectability,and then goes on to greatness himself,with the help of his loyal if perhaps dense buddy Cal Naughton Jr.(John C.Reilly,fantastic here!)and the steady leadership of his pit crew chief Lucius(Michael Clarke Duncan,game in the role). This nets Ricky,over time,a hot wife(Leslie Bibb,doing more than she has to here),two bratty sons(Houston Tumlin and Grayson Russell),more money than he probably ever really needed and the inflated head of someone who KNOWS he's successful. That all starts to tumble when a predatory,snotty French Formula One racer named Jean Girard(Sach Baron Cohen,doing one of ze moost outrageous Franch accents zees side of Monty Python!)steps onto Ricky's territory and is promptly brought on by the racing team for which Ricky is the star. After an accident that leads to a mental breakdown,Jean becomes the lead racer of the team. Soon,Ricky's world starts unraveling,and he finds himself in need of reconnecting to just what it was that made him the great race-car driver he was. He'll need the help of his no-nonsense mom(Jane Lynch,unrecognizable),his former assistant(Amy Adams,fetching and not a bit overpowering) and,of course,his delinquent dad,who seems to come and go in Ricky's life like the wind.As was with Anchorman,Wedding Crashers and You,Me and Dupree,this is a comedy that sets you up for about an hour or so of raucous humor before then sticking' ya with the emotive,heartfelt sap. Director Adam McKay(who also was behind Anchorman)knows a formula that wins when he sees it,and this one does. Plenty of cultural sub-referencing(from celebrity cameos and music of the 70s and 80s)and reliable comic foils(Molly Shannon as the racing owner's wife,Andy Richter as Girard's husband,David Koechnner as one of Ricky's pit crew among them)in minor roles,added to Ferrell and Reilly's improv-to-script(Ferrell co-wrote this with McKAy) performing make this film an easy sell for people who've already bought into the 'Frat pack' type of movie for summer. It,like previous Ferrell efforts have made me laugh out loud and hard on numerous occasions. And while I can understand(and even be put off by it to some degrees)the amount of mapped skill behind movies like this,I have to appreciate it for the kind of summer movie it is: a no-brainer that appeals to one's weirder,more base self.Anyone who likes this type of film will not be disappointed,and those who find Ferrell's antics annoying can(And probably has)avoid it.And anybody who gets distracted by stupid stuff in movies like product placements can sit back and count the ad placements.",8,1,6,20 August 2006
