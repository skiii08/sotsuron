The Avengers," Best Superhero Movie.
","I'm writing this review in response to a lot of the backlash that seems to be happening in the reviews. Despite being the third highest grossing movie of all time, receiving critical acclaim and being in the IMDb Top 250, people in the reviews have been slamming this movie. Why? Not Dark and Gritting Enough? I Loved the Dark Knight but not every movie has to follow that formula (see Amazing Spider-Man, Man Of Steel). No one said this movie was The Godfather or Citizen Kane, because it doesn't have to be! All it has to do is entertain, and it does that in bucketloads. I remember leaving the theater and already I Couldn't wait for the second one. Joss Whedon is one of the greatest writers in the industry (see Buffy, Firefly etc.) and knows his comics (see his run on Astonishing X- Men and Runaways) making him the perfect choice for this movie. It has action and humor and all you could want from a blockbuster movie. Granted, it looks better on the Big Screen, in which case this review is too late, but none the less, if you're a fan of blockbuster movies this is the cream of the crop. If you aren't then be smart enough not to go see it.",8,1,3,10 April 2014
