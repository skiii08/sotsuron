The Avengers," The Avengers
","After finally watching it, I see what the hype was all about. With a cornucopia of extraordinary and awesome special effects, The Avengers is truly the best-super hero film. An ensemble movie that intermingles four major Marvel characters into one awesome movie that has all what a comic fan would want--a fight scene between two of the most powerful and popular character, Iron Man and Thor, and the combined force of the Avengers shown in one movie. Not only does it rise in special effects and cinematography, the superhero extravaganza also has its characters well depicted with powerful the acting wit of Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downey, and the many others. Humor is also a major component that Whedon doesn't seem to forget, however, at times it seems a bit supererogatory. Looking at it from a general view, the film seems superior to any other Marvel film. However, its most obvious downside is the Hulk's lack of humanity which left him with almost nothing but a child playing around with a doll--although it was truly jocular. Overall, Marvel's the Avengers is a great film that will surely quench the thirst of many action-movie goers while having some dramatic and a few romantic scenes for other-genre of movie goers. Its truly a movie worth watching--the movie of 2012. Not only has the movie been praised for its special affects and acting, but it has also broken many records internationally. Waiting for this weekends predicted staggering results, I have high expectations.",8,1,4,6 May 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Review
","A great movie worth watching... incredibly suspenseful and keeping you on the edge of your seat. Full of spectacles that can please anyone. It improves from the other predecessors with a great story line, in action sequences, and novel and interesting technology. It has just enough humor that allows a consummate film experience which allows the movie- watchers to feel a certain degree of relief and expectancy for another sequel. Not only is it action-packed but it also has many other romantic moments that can also extend to more avid buffs. Through such romantic episodes it can allow a more powerful and heart-trending experience. With all such genres, MI4 also shows off his impressive gamut in cultures. For me movies are an area of entertainment and novelty. And in this case, this movie was capable of sending me everywhere; it passed all expectations. You can see Russia's monuments, Dubai's Burj Khalifa, and India's lavish and sumptuous parties. Other interesting aspects were the cars; the BMWi8(concept) in this movie was incredibly and stylishly designed. Its a movie loaded with everything movie-goers would want. Highly entertaining...Worth the tickets...",10,6,10,25 December 2011
Thor," Review
","A truly excellent film, accompanied by a powerful story. Hugely entertaining comic-book adventure that delivers pretty much everything you could want from a Thor movie, thanks to an outstanding script, note-flawless direction from Kenneth Branagh, a tremendous supporting cast and a charismatic, star-making central performance from Chris Hemsworth. The special effects are extraordinary and seemed extensively real. In addition, the fight scenes are nicely handled and the visual effects are impressive, especially in the Halls of Asgard. That said, while the post-production 3D has come out well unlike Clash of the Titans.What was even more interesting was too see how the god's transformation from being an immortal into a mortal didn't change the person who he was. The movie itself was entertaining with nice comedy and action. The actors did a good job in portraying the actors as truly as possible. Kenneth Branagh did in amazing job in directing the film's plot. The character change of Thor was interesting. All together, the film amazed me and left me breathless. In short, Thor is a huge amount of fun and is easily the best superhero movie. Worth Watching!!",9,4,9,1 May 2011
