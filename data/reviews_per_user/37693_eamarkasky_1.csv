They have you wondering for awhile (like The Babbadook) is this supernatural or is the 'craziness' that's hereditary? Let me just say that the latter would have been a better way to go.For the size of the role he had Gabriel Byrne might as well not have been in it. Love him, but his part was pretty short and meaningless. Toni Collette started off good crazy, but ended up just being ridiculous. Not her acting, but how the character was written. So many holes in the story it hurts my brain to try to see any connection of what happens through the first half of the movie to how it ends.So they turn the son into Jughead at the end and treat him like Rosemary's baby? 'Hail paimon' And all the creepy stuff thru out the movie was just ridiculously random. They should have had him reading Archie comics that would have made more sense",2,4,10,21 May 2019
