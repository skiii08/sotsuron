Your Name.," Amazing movie, that's all you need to know
","The movie shows the story of two teenagers that are complete strangers but they have a very weird connection. There are days that they wake up and suddenly they realize that they've swapped bodies. The movie shows how they learn to live with this strange connection but there's something more to it, something that I won't spoil.I can't decide if the movie is fantasy, romantic, comedy or drama because it has a little bit of every one of those. The movie looks beautiful and is very unique, I haven't seen a movie like it in my entire life. The movie is very funny, I was at the theater (almost full) and everyone was laughing a lot at the parts where the movie wanted us to laugh. And it doesn't have a problem to find a balance between comedy and seriousness throughout all of its run time.The two main characters, Mitsuha and Taki, are just two normal teenagers that go to school and hang out with their friends but you care about them and because of this you feel invested in the story. You can feel a lot of emotions throughout the movie and for me, when a movie does that, is the best thing in the world. Honestly, I couldn't find a single flaw with the movie.This is a movie you can't miss. Even if you are not a fan of anime you can enjoy this movie. I enjoy anime but I almost don't watch it but I really loved this movie.",10,3,6,6 August 2017
Dunkirk," It is good, but it definitely has problems.
","It is definitely a good movie, but there are a few things that I didn't like. As you may know, Nolan presents the story of what happened when over 400k soldiers were trapped in Dunkirk during World War II and he decides to tell the story from three different perspectives: one from the ground at the beach, one from the air with a few pilots trying to keep away German planes from the beach and the fishermen that tried to help the soldiers to get away from the beach.The cinematography is outstanding. The film looks amazing and the sound mixing is beautiful, except for the fact that some sounds are extremely loud, like the sounds from the planes when they are hearing them from the ground. I get that those sounds need to be louder but those were exaggerated to the point that they were bothering me and every time they appeared I was hoping that those scenes were over as fast as possible, something that isn't good for any movie.Nolan decides to tell the three stories that are happening at different times and I think that that's where the movie struggles a little because at times I was confused because I didn't know exactly which characters we were looking at that moment. There was a time that it was daytime and at the next scene suddenly it was night time and then the next scene was daytime again and that threw me off a little.I didn't want to talk about the acting because we all know that in a Nolan film it is expected to be great, but I'm going to talk about a casting choice that had a lot of people worried and it's Harry Styles. I didn't expect he was going to be that good. He showed a lot of emotions and was great overall, especially in the scene where (no spoilers) they're inside of a boat they find.I would've liked the movie a little bit more if the narrative wasn't structured in that way, and some people liked it, which is fine, but I didn't. Is not that I hated it, it's just that they could've done it better. Either way, I recommend anyone who is reading this to go see it because it is worth your time.",7,1,5,5 August 2017
