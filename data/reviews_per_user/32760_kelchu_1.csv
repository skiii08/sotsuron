Hereditary," Dissapointing and overhyped
",I have watched that many movies over the years and that many horror movies in particular I tend to get bored with them now as I find there is nothing new to offer so to speak. I heard this movie described as the new 'exorcist' or as terrifying as. Something like that. Anyways I went to see this with my cinema buddy and well to be honest I wasn't over awed. I think I got the story but it all felt and fell rather flat to me. Certainly it's very predictable as in the camera angles give away when something is going to happen. What saves this from me giving this 1 star is the acting. Other than that there is nothing new here. I left at the end thinking 'is that it'.,3,2,4,24 September 2018
