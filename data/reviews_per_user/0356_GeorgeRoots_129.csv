The Avengers," Marvel's Approach To 'The Avengers' Is A Great Payoff, But There's Still A Lot Left To Be Desired.
","And so, here we are with 'The Avengers'. Back in the 1990's Marvel was filing for bankruptcy leading Stan 'The Man' Lee, to sell the film rights to many of their characters. The only rights they have left is 'The Avengers', and explains why they've had to dig into their more obscure past to turn other franchises into movie productions (Namely 2014's fantastic 'Guardians of the Galaxy'). Still, I love the approach they took towards building their big team movie. By establishing this ensemble cast in their own features starting with 'Iron Man' (2008), the following five years lead to a bunch of movies that have many highs and lows leading us all to this point. The results are a success, but also far from flawless.Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of the peacekeeping organisation S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth). To form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) from subjugating Earth, and a much larger looming threat.Knowing that Joss Whedon was going to be writing and directing this, I could already see what directions this movie was going in. Whedon has a rare quirk in his writing that really allows characters to bounce off each other effortlessly, but the directing in some areas always feels stiff to me. I look back to his previous outings as a director, and could easily say that 'The Avengers' have the exact same chemistry as the characters of Whedon's 'Firefly'. Still it feels like he has mastered the way he likes to approach his material, and there's enough to carry its lengthy 2 hour 20 minute running time.Every actor does solid work, and the 'culmination' of these characters from their respected features feels effortless. I want to give Mark Ruffalo and the FX crew particular praise for finally bringing out the Hulk's familiar traits that have felt absent for so long, but I also wish that the character had felt more uncontrollable like in its comic book counterpart (Where they trick him into fighting specific people). I also find myself very underwhelmed when using Loki as a villain. Tom Hiddleston is a fine performer and the role has garnered him hundreds of many fans, but by the third act he's rarely a threat anymore and even then the payoff feels like I said: 'underwhelming'. Saying that, many villains appear throughout the movie that are sure to please the die-hard fans, and promise that the situations will escalate in the inevitable future sequels.Final Verdict: When all is said and done, the dialogue and chemistry works, the scenarios range from great to average and enough substance is here to promise more to come from Marvel's 'Phase 2' of movies (And the upcoming sequel 'Age of Ultron'). It's a Hollywood blockbuster for all ages, and a damn fine one at that. 7.5/10.",7,1,4,1 November 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Lacking The Bang! Pow! Of The First Movie, But Wraps The Story Up Great.
","From the beginning, this sequel (Maybe) has impossible odds of surpassing such an impressive first movie, and overall wrapping up the story of The Bride's quest. Whereas not as good as the first one, 'Kill Bill Volume: 2' has enough shining moments to keep the story going, and also reveals the characters origins thanks to that non-chronological story telling.Uma Thurman is still as deadly as ever. Her quest continues as she goes after Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen), who remains in contact with other 'Deadly Viper Squad' member Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). All of which culminates with 'The Bride' finding Bill, and a surprise revelation.Martial Arts master Pai Mei, played by Gordon Liu is probably the best new character introduced in 'Volume. 2'. Both his & The Bride's scenes together are the movies highlight. Other than that, it's without doubt that this movie contains more dialogue heavy scenes than action. It becomes clear that when the production was coming together, Tarantino put all his best material into 'Volume: 1'. Saying that, there's nothing seriously wrong with 'Volume: 2', and there are a few deleted scenes I wish made it into the final cut. All in all, it wraps the story up well and compliments the first movie more than most sequels do.Final Verdict: Another gem by Tarantino. 7.5/10. I hear of 'Volume. 3', and I hope it never happens.",7,1,4,12 August 2014
Black Swan," One Of The Best From 2010. Something Drew Me To It.
","It has been so long since we've had a decent 'monster' movie, or at least the idea of a psychological breakdown. That's what the initial trailers and marketing expertly depicted and I ended up seeing it twice. It was a film I had been waiting weeks to see and it didn't come out until the 21st January in the UK. However Cineworld theatres were showing it on 18th Jan as a special preview, and out of a 231 seat theatre it was more than 3/4's full. Making me extremely happy that so many people turned up as interested as I was, and awkwardly justifying to my father why I saw a film about Ballet. A week later I went to see it again with 6 local friends, and I certainly began to see the extra little things within certain frames. The film overall is great, beautiful and even poetic.Throughout the first 10 minutes I was worried because it had the typical bitching girls that we saw in 'Showgirls' (1995). But the film does a terrific job of mixing concerns with the Ballet's production, as well as Nina's (Natalie Portman) insecurities, sanity and the overall effects it has on her mind. As the film goes on, it intensifies and build so much towards the final act that should leave you more than satisfied. For those who want ballet, the choreography and swift movement I can't recommend enough. Even if you know little about camera movements, Darren Aronofsky's shots are fantastically switching back and fourth between long range shots to uncomfortably close, all to great effect.The main character Nina is very well acted. No, PERFECTED by Natalie Portman. Displaying the beautiful grace and dedication, but also the insecurities of having to deal with an overbearing mother (The wonderful Barbara Hershey). All this while trying to portray the seductiveness of her 'alter-ego'. Mila Kunis as Lily was very good as playing the exact opposite of Nina, to again great effectiveness and a level of likability and un-likability.Finally the psychological part. At some scenes it can get very graphic in terms of the blood and body morphing, but nothing that I think people would complain about. And the sex I was fine with, as well as surprised that the movie managed to keep its 15 age rating. But all in all, it's not gratuitous and all works to the films advantages. It's not there just to be there, it really does make you think whether or not it's actually happening. If I was to recommend anyone to this film, I personally encourage as many people as possible to see it. If your a surrealist, dancing, or psychological fan, I couldn't recommend this more.Final Verdict: A triumph of work like 'Swan Lake' itself, I think this movie could appeal to just about anyone. 9/10.",9,0,1,15 September 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," These Guys Are Beating A Dead Pirate.
","I'm probably not the only one that groaned upon hearing that they were making a new 'Pirates' movie (And more are planning to come), but is this one worth the watch? We'll begin with the definitive answer, No. I enjoyed a few moments where the movie excelled and as the series progressed, they had become more focused in tying loose ends and focusing on performances. However, this film continues to deliberately set up more impossible scenarios, and the slapstick levels of the previous entries is jacked up significantly this time around.Johnny Depp is reportedly getting tired of the Jack Sparrow character, and in a way so am I. He has only gotten worse since the second movie, and the star who shines the most now is Geoffrey Rush. When he plays eccentric, he delivers way beyond expectations. The newer cast members are somewhat the least likable. Gone are Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, in come Penelope Cruz (Well-casted enough) and Ian Mcshane as a terrific rendition of Blackbeard, yet they do nothing with the character. Forgive me when I say I don't know their names, but the actor and actress whose spontaneous romance as a priest and mermaid was so damn cringe worthy it felt like I jumped into 'Twilight' (2008).Well there's a quest for the fabled 'Fountain of Youth'. However, in order for the magic to work they must succeed in having two people drink from two identical magical chalices, whilst also acquiring a mermaids tear. If successful, one will inherited all the other persons previous and remaining years (Those are some pretty challenging guidelines). I never remembered any of this when hearing any fables of the Fountain, but that's a lot of tasks. Luckily our heroes will have a lot to do, yet all we must do to succeed is watch two hours of this tedious bore.Okay, I understand sarcasm is finding its way into my review, but honestly when writing all that down wouldn't yours also? Anyone who has seen this must have felt gob smacked and in the wrong way. But for the bad things I've said, there are some good scenes and fun to be had. After putting up with a load of coral reef monsters in the previous instalments, it's good to at least know they calmed down on all that. There are a lot of scenes that really blew me away such as the chase scene through London, and when the characters finally get to where their going, the stylistic look of this movie gets a thumbs up from me.Final Verdict: Good enough, but didn't really add anything new either. The 3-D sucks and this franchise just has to finish now, but as we know, it won't happen that easily. 5/10.",5,1,1,4 September 2014
Scarface," Brian De Palma's Finest Work As A Director.
","'Scarface' is probably the finest contemporary gangster movie of it's time. It's relevance continues to bombard today through it's imagery, and the story has gone on to influence many musician's of the 'Def Jam Records' label. Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay, Brian De Palma directs and Al Pacino shines in this rag's to rich's story. Based on the original 1932 classic 'Scarface: The Shame of the Nation'.In 1980, Cuban Refugee Tony Montana (Al Pachino) arrives in Miami. After working various low cuff jobs, the short tempered Tony immediately throws himself into the underworld of the Miami drug trade. His initial outcomes are disastrous, yet end with considerable results. Eventually like anyone in that line of work, a hit is put out on him. After wrapping up that nuisance he slowly ascends the ladder from street level dealer, to running a multi-million dollar drug empire. After he eventually manages to isolate himself from everyone (Even his closest friends and family), fellow drug lord Sosa (Paul Shenar) sends his men to Tony's mansion, culminating in a stunning finale of a shootout. Sounds a little like 'Citizen Kane' to me, minus the cocaine and guns. Every time I watch the movie, I fall a little more in love with it. It captures the intensity of the drug trade, and the montages are undeniably a staple of many imitations. Tony Montana is certainly one of the best mobsters ever put on film. Regardless how unlikable he becomes, Al Pacino delivers a very engaging performance that sees an individual go up and down a ladder that depending on your sensibilities, isn't really worth climbing. The only negative I think it has is it's running length. For as many scenes they have (Which are fantastic), some just do not hold up to the pacing the movie set itself and feel needlessly drawn out.Final Verdict: When all is said and done, it's just very unforgettable. The night club, torture and shoot out scenes make for very intensive, but highly influential stuff. 9/10.",9,0,2,8 August 2014
Alien 3," A Fall From Grace That Should End Here...
","I can just about get away with this movie. 'Alien3', is sadly the result of a lot of production problems on set. It is the first time feature movie for David Fincher, who pretty much had to work with a movie already half complete and pretty much had no final say in any aspect of production. I do request you look into this online, as it is pretty fascinating to see how far problems went to reach a result such as this.However, I really do enjoy the new 'Dog' Alien design. I especially liked that they went back to the formula of the first movie, with even less ways of defending themselves from such a threat and on a prison planet no less. After the intense finale of 'Aliens' (1986), Ripley is again thrusted into a world of monsters and further emotional turmoil (survivors guilt perhaps?). Stuck on a prison planet full of men and unfortunately the monsters have also followed her here, can she pull a hat trick?A lot of the inmates can be interesting characters, but most of them are without a doubt dull. I didn't care for them like I did the marines of 'Aliens', and it all feels like a stupid joke compared to how great the first two movies managed to do well with even less. Surprisingly what I do like in this film is how run down everything looks, the prison has aged and been left to rot with the trash inhabiting it. All of this makes for some surprisingly good POV shots from the Alien and when implemented for the first time, it's very effective.Final Verdict: Funny enough, it's not skimpy women running from a killer and I apologise for keep referring to the previous movies. But this clearly should have been the last in the series, given the problems behind it. 5/10. Even scoring it now, I'm torn about how many times I could re-watch this before ultimately switching off.",5,0,1,28 June 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Most Fun To Ever Be Had At The Movies...
","My number one favourite movie of all time, and pretty much the pinnacle of adventure Cinema. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a film that no matter how many times it re-runs on Television, I can sit down and watch it indefinitely. It is a marvel piece of cinema that was brought to life by two of Hollywood's biggest names, Steven Spielberg & George Lucas (Director Philip Kaufman was originally set to direct before Spielberg, he is credited as a co-writer on the story). Both were inspired by the old film serials of the 1930's and 1940's, where adventurers will survive and escape virtually all kinds of in-escapable peril. Harrison Ford is in his prime as the famous fictional architect Indiana Jones, whose journeys would involve bizarre riddles and strange hieroglyphics that would usually result in disasters of biblical proportions.At the very beginning of the movie, we're in the middle of a jungle exhibition with a mood defining score from John Williams and a younger, thinner Alfred Molina. Suddenly we enter a tomb and already the film has set its entire mood and expectations within minutes. Suddenly we see what little of Jones's regular life is like as a College professor, and in no time we see him off on another adventure searching for the legendary Ark of the Covenant (Built by the Israeli's to hold the fragments of The Ten Commandments). This sees Indy travelling to Nepal to meet his old flame Marion (Karen Allen), who may hold the key to finding the Ark. Unaware that both of them are being followed and hunted by Nazi Gestapos sent by Hitler to collect the Ark for himself, this revelation pairs Indy and Marion together as they head for Cairo to find it first.Among the highlights of the movie as said before is the cave, the bar fight in Nepal, the famous market chase and the undeniably funny 'Gun to the Swordfight' scene (Ford had diarrhoea). All these scenes and so many others continuously loop in the memories of my brain. Even the ending of the film is so famous, it has been more than parodied to death in recent Pop-Culture.The special effects and visual style in this film are truly a lost art. From the wax melting faces and giant fibreglass boulders, to breathing streets of Cairo and dimly lit dungeons meant everything and anything could come out at you anytime, anywhere. Among the talent behind this movie, Joe Johnston won an Academy Award for his effects work and would later turn to directing. His most recent feature being 'Captain America: The First Avenger' (2011), which has a wonderful throwback to 'Raiders' ('And the Fuhrer digs for trinkets in the desert'). Michael Bay was the storyboard artist who thought the movie was going to be horrible, then he finally saw it and loved it enough to become a film-maker himself (Yet he really needs to learn a thing or two).Even now as I write and dive into this movie, I can't fully explain why it's all such a gem to me. Adventure films before and after never really reached this kind of magnitude, not even in the sequels. No matter when and where it's on, I just have to sit and watch it. All in all, you're along for the ride and once it has started there's no going back. I have been researching thoroughly through the history of Cinema, and whilst I have found many better treasures among Japan, Sweden and Italy etc. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', even after all I've said there's no possible way to fully describe what the experience meant to me. But why it means so much, summed up in one sentence is: 'One of the most imaginative thrill ride movies ever made, and that's what I consider Cinema and story telling all about'.Final Verdict: I loved it the first time I saw it, and I'll most likely continue to love it till the day I die. It's not the best film ever made, but I'll never be able to hate it. 10/10.",10,1,2,15 November 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Spielbergs Charming Movie About A Lost Alien Still Holds Up 'Well Enough'.
","Has 'E.T.' stood the test of time? I do consider it a classic, and it does a service to the Family, Sci-Fi genre. It started with Spielberg's 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (Which I prefer), and ever since it has been replicated to death and only rarely does it appeal to all ages anymore (J.J. Abrams did a very good job in 2011 with 'Super 8', which was also produced by Spielberg).It tells the story of Elliott (Henry Thomas), a lonely boy who befriends an extraterrestrial (Dubbed 'E.T.'), who is stranded on Earth. Elliott and his siblings try to help it return home, while attempting to keep it hidden from their mother and the government. A government that replaces its guns with walkie-talkies in the 2002 re-release (Thanks whoever's decision was that).To be honest with you all, I feel the film is 'getting there'. I mean no one ever really talks about it extensively anymore, we just acknowledge it and sadly I admit to channel flicking to something else. So what I still enjoy about this film is that E.T. STILL looks totally convincing, proving that the effects of this movie is timeless and has that trademark fantasy that Spielberg incorporates into many of his movies. It would also be incredibly wrong not to say that some of its movies scenes are unforgettable, as well as that unbelievable music score by John Williams.But what I am starting to dislike about the movie are a few things. For as good as Henry Thomas is as a child actor, his voice is a scratch on a chalkboard and sometimes it just comes off a little too dramatic and unreal a performance. And finally, just the overall length of this movie feels like they stretch it out for all its worth. I know you could say that they are trying to get you to connect more with all the characters, but after viewing the movie over 6 times it never really worked for me like Spielberg's other work and kind of leaves me bored and unsatisfied.Final Verdict: Ultimately I think the film still holds up well in the effects, and the overall acting. But even though you know how classic this film is, it feels like a chore in order to watch it from beginning to end. Regardless it's in my Blu-ray collection, Walkie-talkies an' all. 7.5/10.",7,2,4,27 September 2014
Gravity," Unless The Camera Orbits You, No One In Space Can Hear You Scream.
","Hands down, 'Gravity' is 2013's best Sci-Fi movie. Within the last couple of years we've had one major effects spectacle each year, and Alfonso Cuaron has done wonders in crafting something both familiar and awe-inspiring. I don't know how he managed to pitch something this ambitious. Filmed in four months at Pinewood studios, heavily researched (to an extent) and shot entirely in impressive lengthy 15 minute takes. Cuaron, against all odds has managed to convince studios to let him make a film of incredible spectacle with some great cinematography by the inventive Emmanuel Lubezki. All in the black vacuum of space, he still manages to incorporate some of the darker traits from his previous movies as well as constantly keeping you on edge and building tension.Short story short(er). Five astronauts get caught in the midst of razor sharp debris, resulting in the destruction of their spacecraft and heavy casualties. In a race against time before complete loss of oxygen, veteran Matt (Clooney) & newcomer Stone (Bullock) must work against all odds to get back to earth, or risk drifting away into the vast emptiness of space.The roles are a breath of fresh air for both Clooney and Bullock. She has the most to prove as this is far different from her usual outings, and she managed to bring a performance I didn't know she was actually capable of (Even though she is a reluctant astronaut, thanks Louis C.K). It's really hard to go in depth on a film of this calibre, mostly because I personally kept away from the hype. In a nutshell, it features one of the most radical depictions of space in a long time, and proper NASA terminology and oxygen deprivation build a level of struggle and believability. Zero gravity has never looked so livid, and the constantly orbiting camera is as superb as it is nauseating. But I do want to make clear that even though I have praised this film for its levels of science, one key scene that changes the entire drama of the movie is where they float away from each other and the physics are altered for the sake of the story. It's a little gripe I know, but personally it definitely would have been wise to somehow alter that. Final Verdict: Regardless, 'Gravity' is a film that my praise lies mostly on superb camera skills, technicality and very imaginative craft than a story driven piece. Rest assured future depictions of space have a lot more to live up to from now on. 8/10.",8,1,2,16 November 2013
Se7en," What's In The Box? Am I Right People?
","'Se7en' is an exceptional thriller written by Andrew Kevin Walker, and directed by the always more than impressive David Fincher. The lack of creative freedom he had with 'Alien3' (1992) turned him off the idea of creating anymore, but the script they sent him managed to garner his enthusiasm. Unfortunately they also sent him the script with the original ending they wasn't going to use, leading to Fincher and Brad Pitt fighting for the script. It's a fascinating story I bring up because the film has rumours of many alternate endings, I implore you to do a little research on what might have been.I suppose I should also say if you're a fan of 'CSI' (2000-present), then you must have seen 'Se7en'. The newly transferred David Mills (Brad Pitt) and the retiring William Somerset (Freeman), are homicide detectives who become deeply involved in the case of a sadistic serial killer, whose meticulously planned murders correspond to the seven deadly sins. From the uniquely disturbing title sequence, to the overall shocking scenarios and finale. After watching this movie so many times now, I'm stunned at how engaging and refreshed I am to watch it all again and still find little things in the corners of each frame and shot composition. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt's chemistry and banter together is still as engaging, and how they haven't appeared in a film together since is beyond me. It was also the time rising star Kevin Spacey was on the scene, and even with the little screen time he has his presence is so memorable it's crazy.Other than that, the brutal crime scenes still have the power to shock and make people feel faint. To me David Fincher's work has this kind of style that began with 'Se7en', and over the years he's made it distinctly his own. Nowhere is this more prominent than in the long bleak shots of the city in both night and heavy downpour, and for some reason part of me hearkens back to the urban street life painted in 'Taxi Driver' (1976). The performances are solid, the set pieces are vivid and the script work and pacing is impeccable. If you haven't already seen it, stop what you're doing and definitely make it you're next viewing experience because it really is one of the 1990's absolute best.Final Verdict: Often mimicked, yet never trumped. In a current wave of never ending shoddy horror movies, 'Se7en' is one of those rare cinematic experiences that will keep you enthralled all the way towards the credits. 10/10.",10,1,4,13 October 2014
Akira," Tetsuo's Gotta Die... Like Right NOW!!!
","Now granted that when I was a kid, I enjoyed 'Pokémon' and 'Dragonball Z' immensely. Growing up I've became more aware of anime's many genres and sadly the majority I found were nothing but goofy, repetitive drawing styles & unprovocative story lines. Now I come across 'Akira', A manga that apparently matured a way of storytelling the same way Alan Moore did with American comics in the 1980's. Suddenly after a little research shows that 'Kill Bill' (2003), was influenced by the manga 'Lady Snowblood'. 'The Matrix' (1999) was pretty much 'Ghost in the Shell' with a fresh coat of paint, and practically anything from Studio Ghibli shows that Anime can be as provocative as anything Disney has to offer.Tokyo is in the year 2019. Teenage Gang Leader Shotaro Kaneda, pretty much spends his time harassing other gangs in extremely high speed chases. Eventually teenage biker Tetsuo Shima is caught in an accident leading to his abduction. What follows is the gang trying to find their lost friend, and the consequences of what Tetsuo could soon be capable of.Many who can sit through this two hour adaptation of a 1000 page Manga can luckily look forward to being treated like adults, as well as a VERY detailed animated feature consisting of more than 160,000 cells of animation! Featuring a neon lit Tokyo as stunning as the look of 'Blade Runner' (1982), this film is literally eye candy. Every explosion looks detailed, every street corner has immense depth and overall every crowded place just looks consistent. The story I won't spoil for you, but it features everything you could want to revolve around a Cyber-punk futuristic city. Crazy vehicles, militarised areas and psychic powers from the most bastard kid ever drawn, all in all you have something that you can be proud to call 'Influential'.Final Verdict: It's not for everyone and believe me when I say that, but for those who can sit through it all may be pleasantly surprised and optimistic in checking out similar works. 9/10.",9,3,6,16 November 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Mr. Landa You Flatter Me.
","I really enjoyed 'Inglourious Basterds' overall. It has all the Tarantino mannerisms you could shake a stick at, but I did get pretty bored halfway through. In a nutshell it's 2 hours of solid dialogue and directing, culminating with the final 20 minutes being an utter absurd spectacle.I'm glad Brad Pitt finally make his way into a directed Tarantino film, and his presence doesn't upset the balance or feel out of place in anyway. Eli Roth as Donny Dolowitz was a solid performance, and the appearances of Michael Fassbender, Mike Myers, Lea Seydoux, Melanie Laurent, Diane Kruger, Rod Taylor and Daniel Bruhl make for one of the greatest casts of that year. But you all know who stole the show, WHAT an unbelievable find in Christoph Waltz, who won so many deserved awards and I still thought that under-rated him. Tarantino went on to say he believed he wrote a character who couldn't be performed, and that Waltz had 'Gave him his movie'. What an incredible performance from a completely unknown actor.Like I said earlier I really enjoyed this film, but I hope Tarintino starts shaking up the formula in his films. I loved 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' (2003), but 'Vol.2' suffered a major pacing problem as well as 'Death Proof' (2007), even though that finale was amazing.Final Verdict: Very good stuff, as always you can look forward to a Tarintino movie. 8.5/10.",8,0,0,8 September 2014
Dawn of the Dead," What Shouldn't Work, Wasn't All Too Bad.
","At first you'd think 'Wow, what a horrible idea'. One of the most beloved horror-satire movies of all time really needs to be remade? Surprisingly, if you give it a chance you see that the movie had decided to do the smart thing. With a script handled by James Gunn, the satire of the original is removed and the film-makers go in there own direction with a totally different approach altogether. Still, the movie has its flaws and I don't think it holds up well to the original, making me wish it was just called something else. It'll definitely appeal to the younger generation of people who don't want to think, but would rather just see large amount of bullets and half a cast of dumb-ass, uninteresting characters just waiting to be eaten.Still, Zack Snyder did a solid job for his first feature. He definitely knows how to give visual flair to even the smallest things, and the camera catches everything well. Notable actors from the first movie make an appearance, and Sarah Polley as well as Ving Rhames are the most likable characters in a group that arguably may have too many people in it. It's definitely not a zombie movie for the Romero crowd that's for sure.Final Verdict: Enjoyable and not all bad for a Romero remake. Leave your brain at the door and have some fun. 6/10.",6,1,2,17 August 2014
Alien: Resurrection," In The Multiplex, Everybody Can Hear You Scream.
","This is where the series got REALLY far-fetched and considering what this franchise is about, that's saying something. In the first 5 minutes they completely retcon the final events of 'Alien3' (1992), by cloning Ripley to the point when she was carrying the Alien. Obviously money grabbing scientist's (One played by Brad Dourif) never learn, and of course (SHOCK) the aliens escape.Our supporting cast comes in the form of mercenaries, namely Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman. Not one of them are likable, but hell what can you do with such a p*ss poor script. Even with Joss Whedon coming off 'Toy Story' (1995), I just did not connect with it considering how much I am a fan of his other work. And now this is what I really want to dig into, the handling of Ripley is horrendous. As much as I enjoy Sigourney Weaver, even she cannot save this emotionally detached performance. We became her in 'Alien' (1979), became stronger with her in 'Aliens' (1986) and ultimately conquered everything by 'Alien3'. There is nothing left to do, and nothing new to overcome as she has pretty much became an alien now (I don't know she has acid blood or something). Some new alien comes along with pinkish flesh and looking back it was ridiculous, telling me that this movie just doesn't know what to do with itself and would rather sacrifice suspense for a few oddities here and there.Final Verdict: When I first saw this, I was 15 and accepted it as decent conclusion to the series. Seven years on however, I can't believe how they got away with something so half-baked. In a sense the movies style is reminiscent of 'Aliens', but in the end all it does is make you wish you were watching that movie instead of this trash. 3/10.",3,0,2,28 June 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Decent, Yet Takes The Franchise Into Strange Territory.
","Obviously a considerable amount of hype went into the sequel after such a stellar first movie. With a sub-title like 'Dead Man's Chest', anything could happen and there is a plethora of pirate lore to pick from.Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann's (Keira Knightley) marriage is interrupted, as Will is acquired to collect a compass from Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to find the 'Dead Man's Chest'. Meanwhile, Sparrow discovers his debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) is due and so begins the race for the chest, whilst having to escape the clutches of Davy Jones's pet, 'The Kraken'.Things to definitely admire this time around are Bill Nighy's wonderful contributions as a performer. Watching him reveals an inner conflict to the character, that never surfaces to an extent where it appears formulaic. Johnny Depp is still wonderful, and definitely keeps true to the character he made iconic in so little time. Plus, the movies $225 million budget spares no expense in terms of stunts and visuals.Unfortunately, for as decent as the visuals are in this picture the story is pretty dull. The film-makers certainly enjoy bringing a sense of 'darker' elements this time around, but it felt like everything else was sacrificed in the process. Most character development is shoddy, and the dialogue isn't much either. All in all, I still love Gore Verbinski's camera work and the level of development is admirable, yet the narrative can't help but feel dumbed down into many Hollywood cliché's. Those well choreographed fight scenes now implement some intentionally hammy stunts and mishaps that never descend the movie into slapstick, but certainly more style over substance. Final Verdict: A movie worth seeing for performances alone, however everything else is severely lacking. 6.5/10.",6,0,0,21 August 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Finally, A Decent Pirate Movie Back On The Silver Screen.
","The first movie after all these unnecessary sequels, still remains the best movie. When I first watched 'Pirates of the Caribbean' at the age of 11, it breathed new life into pirate movies that seemed to have been absent since 'Hook' (1991). Luckily with a fantastic score by Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer, plus fantastic performances from Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. It's debatable who steals the show, as director Gore Verbinski creates a movie that is anything but slow and visually wonderful.'Captain' Jack Sparrow (Depp), searches for a ship and crew in order to get revenge from Captain Barbossa (Rush), and claim back his ship the legendary 'Black Pearl'. Unfortunately along his way, he also manages to involve Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and local blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Who become entangled with the villainous pirates and their quest to break an ancient curse.Saying all that. I suppose I would like to jokingly shoot myself in the foot, and say what are the point of all these wonderful fight scenes if they're cursed skeletons who remain pretty much invulnerable? Regardless, the styles and influences definitely hearkens back to the Golden age of Hollywood. The choreography is swift and for as much as the CGI is wonderfully rendered, a majority of effects are practical thanks to the films impressive budget (Thank you Jerry Bruckheimer).Final Verdict: One of the better live action Disney movies, and probably the best movie ever based on a theme park ride. 8/10.",8,0,2,18 August 2014
Oldboy," The Only Film Passed The Year 2000 In My Top 10 All Time Favourites.
","For now, 'Oldboy' still remains the best foreign movie I've ever seen. Ultimately because you just don't see films like this, as its revenge story is just so utterly raw and powerful only the East would get it right.Its very obvious Park Chan Wook had passion for the Manga it was based on (Personally I do not like all Manga, aside from a few exceptions). Being that the original story would not make for something entirely gripping, Wook inserts one of the most brutal revenge schemes ever conceived in cinema. Showing the raw tragedy all parties must face when chasing vengeance.Oh-Dae-Su is the kind of protagonist you will feel pity, sympathy, empathy and hate throughout all acts of the movie. It's a unique trait that usually takes a cast of many to portray in a single movie, yet Choi Min-Sik delivers all of them to this damaged man perfectly. He is kidnapped off the street and placed in a hotel room for 15 years, after multiple gassing and suicide attempts he begins a quest to find out who did this to him in a record of many angry individuals. Upon his release he immediately sets out on his mission with the aid of Mi-do (Kang Hye-Jung), who has taken a bizarre interest in his endeavour.From the opening as the film begins to tell us and reveal Oh-Dae-Su's thoughts, it reminds me a lot of the pacing from Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' (1976). It's incredibly hard to reveal a damaged individuals thoughts in a movie, and make it compelling as there are so many imitations. Yet Wook employs the right amount of quirky characters and places them all in 'real time' via 5 days by act 2 & 3, that the narrative is constantly strong throughout the 2 hour running time.The camera work I feel is superb, and the special effects are kept to a minimal. I've grown tired of slow motion in fight choreography, and 'Oldboy' has undoubted one of the best corridor fight scenes ever created. Every punch has weight, and every torture scene is brutal yet relevant. It's indescribably gorgeous, and doesn't shy away from how a revenge story should be depicted.Final Verdict: To conclude, I very much loved this movie. I have watched it multiple times and my love for it only deepens. Please avoid the Spike Lee remake at the very least, until you have seen this picture. 10/10. Unforgettable.",10,1,6,11 July 2014
Spider-Man 2," The Best Spider-Man Will Ever Get On The Big Screen.
","As I'm writing this in 2014, and we've seen a plethora of 'Spider-Man' in various media over the last couple of years. it's hard to believe this sequel improved so much of what was arguably a really solid first instalment. 'Spider-Man 2' remains me & my fathers personal favourite. Already as soon as the opening credits began, they recap everything so far with illustrations by comic book icon Alex Ross. It all feels like natural progression, showing signs that we were in for something very unique.First off I need to say Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus was incredible. For as silly the villain may look in print, the mind behind the character is what always made him interesting and they play their cards right by making him a victim of tragedy more than a evil genius. Of course his motivations to prove himself and his life's work will doom us all, but some homespun (Heh.) wisdom will ultimately make him see the right his errors. It's a great performance, and seeing as how comic book movies are becoming more popular every year. I'm sure we'll see the character return someday. Mr. Molina has set the standard considerably.Before I finally get to the Peter Parker portion of the movie, lets go over the supporting cast. James Franco finally has more to work with this time, and generally comes off maleficent. Kirsten Dunst's performance like the first one is likable, but the character still has yet to really do anything rather than be the object of the heroes desire and development for the character throughout the movie pretty much remains just that. Except for the end, which is more or less sweet. Finally what must be mentioned is Rosemary Harris's performance as Aunt May, which is wonderful and explains some of the highlights and themes of the original Sam Raimi trilogy. As much as Peter will have to learn for himself, she is the one who will always rest his mind over the guilt he suffers and teaches him the advice that will guide him throughout life's choices.Tobey Maguire finally gets to show the side of Spider-Man I wanted to see. The famous issue where Spider-Man leaves his costume in the trash is iconic, and works well in the films narrative structure of choices and sacrifice. Just reflecting the movie now as a whole there are only a few problems I see in the picture, that seem to be immediately forgiven amongst some very impressive action sequences. All of which remain unique & fantastic, whilst The quiet moments of self reflection are boosted by Danny Elfman's solemn score.Final Verdict: I think Spider-Man 2 is the best in the series, and best reflects what makes the icon so beloved by many. 9/10.",9,4,6,29 July 2014
The Fifth Element," Do You Want Extra Cheese With That Joke?
","'The Fifth Element', has pretty much all the ingredients to make an entire franchise around it. Taking elements from the iconic comic book series 'The Incal', by Alejandro Jodorowsky & Jean Giraud (Moebius), and 'The Circles of Power', by Pierre Christin & Jean-Claude Mezieres. For whatever reason I find this movie to be extremely underrated. The performances, effects, and various species just make me wish more people would talk about it nowadays.Set in the twenty-third century. The story involves the survival of Earth, which becomes the responsibility of Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), a taxicab driver and former special forces major. After a young woman (Milla Jovovich) falls into his cab, Dallas joins forces with her to recover four mystical stones essential for the defence of Earth against the impending attack.Bruce Willis is our lead. Playing the usual tough guy persona is nothing unfamiliar, but I think this character is a lot more well developed than the usual one off film he does here and there. Milla Jovovich is wonderfully quirky as the naive Leeloo, who trained vigorously for her role as well as developing a fictional language of 400 words with the director. Finally, Gary Oldman shines again as the corrupt businessman Zorg, fresh from the eccentrics of Besson's 'Leon: The Professional' (1994). The likes of Ian Holm, Chris Tucker, Luke Perry and comedian Lee Evans build a wonderful supporting cast.To best describe it's sprawling futuristic city visuals of flying cars and eccentric uniforms, it's essentially 'Blade Runner' (1982), set in the daylight. The way this city breaths is like a dance of sorts with great pacing, a fantastic soundtrack and energy that compliments this outlandish movie so well. You'll believe almost anything that is thrown at you and take it as the norm. Being that it was the costliest European film at the time of it's release, it seemed to divide people's opinions straight down the middle.Final Verdict: Luc Besson literally created an amazingly French science fiction movie, that captures the 'Bande Dessinée' vibes and adapts them to a tee. It's my sci-fi equivalent to 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' (1971). 9/10.",9,2,4,26 August 2014
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," As A Wolverine Fan, What A Kick In The Nuts This Was
","In a nutshell, 'X-men Origins: Wolverine' butchered everything that the true origin had explained in the comic books. But I'm all for taking apart and embellishing certain elements for the sake of a cinematic adaptation.But just 'because', I feel the need to say this: 1. Wolverine & Sabertooth were never brothers, and this really doesn't even add that much to the story they tell. 2. 'Weapon X' only ever consisted of Wolverine, Dead-Pool, Omega-Red & Sabertooth. The pointless additions of Will.I.Am, and 'The Blob' (For some reason they show him skinny which never was the case, hence the name) added nothing in the scenes they were all together in. And finally, 3. Is the pointless addition of characters such as Gambit, Emma Frost, and Cyclops who don't belong in this story and again did nothing while on screen.Hugh Jackman I will admit is still fantastic in the lead role, and definitely stands out as the superior actor of all this mess. I usually love Liev Schreiber, but his character really needed development and then I might of actually cared for what they were trying to portray. The choreography is actually really good in these fight scenes, and with martial artist Scott Adkins in the finale make for some wonderfully unique moments. But aside from those small good aspects, everyone else is horrible. There the same villain stereotypes we have seen in previous instalments, and none of them manage to pull it off as well.Final Verdict: A hit & miss action flick that mostly misses. It's bland fun, but definitely not one of my recommendations. I just cannot believe that Gavin Hood, the man responsible for the fantastic foreign language picture 'Tsotsi' (2005), was responsible for this. 3/10.",3,1,3,27 September 2014
Terminator Salvation," I Won't Be Back...
","Sadly after spending a few months really anticipating the release of this movie, I give it kudos for trying something different. But ultimately condemn it for lacking the charm, or aesthetic look of it's previous titles.I give praise to Sam Worthington for giving us a half-formed character, even though he comes off a bit forced there's definitely a likability to be had. But Christian Bale's John Connor dialogue makes him come off as an utter meat head, that means a waste of talent from a very renowned actor. Taunting us with both a CGI Arnold (Ok my face lit up at that scene), and the horrible demise of Brad Fiedel's solid 'Terminator' theme. It's clear that giving the Terminator franchise to 'McG' ('Charlie's Angels'), was clearly not the direction for the franchise to go in.Final Verdict: It's visuals are distinctive, though it sets itself apart from previous outings. The Terminator franchise is built upon these aspects, and draw us in considerably well for a series that has done nothing but follow the same formula since it's conception back in 1984. Sadly there is no salvation here. 3/10.Duh Duh duh duh duh, Duh Duh duh duh duh.",3,0,3,3 December 2014
The Day After Tomorrow," As Far As Roland Emmerich goes, This Is Pretty Darn Good.
","Whether you loved this movie or hated it, this is the only Roland Emmerich film I've ever enjoyed. Sure I can vouch I enjoyed 'Godzilla' (1998) as a kid back in the day, but growing up and looking back these asses ripped off 'Jurassic Park (1993) so bad. I suppose I can see the appeal certain audiences members have for these kind of disaster pictures, but why do they always have to be weighed down by worse than cardboard cut out characters and awful dialogue. I guess this film finally won me over due to its take on global warming. I particularly loved the fact it wasn't space invasion or end of days predicaments, yet that doesn't mean this film is flawless.Of course this movie is built on nothing but effects. However, we have some decent actors to keep the flow going considerably well, when 3/4 of your time is spent in government labs & meetings. One thing I really enjoyed as well was the movies soundtrack. Yeah they repeat that one song a little too much, but if I'm going to complain about that small thing I might as well declare myself pretty narcissist.Final Verdict: Forget 'Independence Day' (1996), and '2012' (2009). Check out this disaster film that actually has a decent script attached to it. 7/10.",7,1,1,21 August 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," This Third Outing Isn't Sea Worthy, Arghh!
","Both 'Dead Man's Chest' (2006), and 'At World's End' were both shot back to back. With the final outing costing $300 million, you'd expect with a budget that large they were going to go out with a bang and they truly do (Or so we thought). A truly good looking film at least, but it's nothing different than the second one and nothing really engaged me anymore in this series (Though the trailers and marketing were pretty fantastic).Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), a resurrected Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and the remaining crew of the Black Pearl, plan to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from Davy Jones' Locker. From there on, all pirates are beckoned to prepare and fight the East India Trading Company and Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), who plans to extinguish piracy forever.Chow Yun-fat makes his first appearance in the series, one of my favourite Honk Kong actors and his addition was absolutely pointless. Imagine my disappointment in a franchise that is particularly built on eccentric performers, and they under use him when he generally did pretty well with the material on screen.Apart from that, nothing new is brought into the film. I seriously couldn't care anymore about the characters, the scenarios, bad writing etc. As time went by the movies became visual rollercoasters, but to be fair that's really the only direction they could take them in. Yes, I could want more from it, and most of the finale entries in trilogies nowadays can be a lot worse. It did pretty well in finishing what it started, but it was one of the first times I remember coming out the theatre and all of us feeling underwhelmed.Final Verdict: Worth checking out if you're curious to see the finale, but nothing really special either. 5/10. It was good while it lasted, until they made a fourth one.",5,0,0,21 August 2014
X-Men," Brings The X-Men Onto Screen With Stunning Confidence, But Nothing Really Special Either.
","Now whether you agree with me or not, I could never really get into the first X-Men movie. If you were to ask me the highlights of the first movie, I'd say it established beloved characters impressively and had stellar acting throughout. Then all I could think about was the dull pacing of this movie, a final confrontation that I found unimpressive and a pretty much absurd plan from the villain (I understood the plan, I just thought how convenient and nonchalant everything managed to come together).That said though, the movie was more than impressive in other aspects. I liked that it included its fear of mutants (Originally a stab at communism), and it was extremely well casted. Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen portray Xavier & Magneto to a tee. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine had slowly grown into the role for me, as well as Halle Berry, James Marsden and Rebecca Romijn etc. Who all did a fantastic job.Final Verdict: Was this really a good X-men movie? I greatly respect Bryan Singer's filmography and as I currently write, there are a plethora of better X-Men movies to choose from. 6/10. It was one of the first of it's kind for the new millennium, but it's starting to show it's age considerably.",6,1,1,3 September 2014
Spider-Man 3," Unnecessary Additions To The Franchise Is What Killed It.
","'Spider-Man 3' at the time remained one of the most anticipated movies in all my life, mostly because I saw the trailer about a year before it actually came out. Looking back at my 14 year old self, the only highlight to be said about 'Spider-Man 3' is that it was the first movie I 'hyped' for considerably.Well at the time the film had the biggest opening weekend, and I contributed by seeing it 3 times in the span of a week. Had I been paying enough attention, I should have seen that the franchise took a somewhat bizarre turn for the worse and effectively ended the series before more damage could be made. Looking back after those repeated viewings I can just about get away this one, but the drop in quality is considerable. Sam Raimi never wanted to approach the symbiote costume, but was forced to due to fan demand. Peter does become fairly interesting when the alien takes over, but ultimately reduces him to a whiny, dancing, hard to relate to 'emo' character with his hair down (I can't believe I just wrote that in a Spider-Man review).After all that, the film becomes very depressing in a sense. Redeeming qualities is that Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) becomes a lot more of a fleshed out character, and Thomas Haden Church was phenomenal as Sandman. For everything bad that people say about this movie, did they forget the scene when they introduced the character after the transformation?Other than that, the movie continues to gradually go down hill. The original comic book storyline the movie is based on has some of the most visually striking moments in the characters history (Including a nightmare sequence, where the two costumes fight over a powerless Peter Parker), why none of it was incorporated is beyond me. Three's a crowd with the villain aspect, leaving no development for rising antagonists from previous instalments. The addition of Gwen Stacy was pointless this late in the game, and I enjoy Topher Grace but I feel that was really bad casting on someones part.Overall, what can be said is that I enjoyed some of the visuals that were displayed, and the action scenes still work but lack the scenarios that made the previous battles so enthralling. I'm glad that 'Spider-Man 4' didn't happen, even though what I heard would have been very interesting to see.Final Verdict: Flawed. Sam Raimi gave us two of the best superhero movies the genre has to offer, so I think we can forgive him for this. 5/10.",5,0,3,29 July 2014
Resident Evil: Extinction," The First Resident Evil Story In The Desert.
","You might want to hunt me down, but I do enjoy this one because it does try new things. This is the first time a 'Resident Evil' story is set in the desert, which is something I have been waiting to see. For the most part they do very well, but there's not really that much screen time in Vegas which disappointed me when it was the focus of marketing.Milla Jovovich gives the final performance of Alice I enjoyed as everything beyond this became awful. I really did not care for these new telekinetic abilities she's gained, and the character is now running on nothing more than fumes. Oded Fehr and Mike Epps pleasantly return. Ali Larter is introduced offering good supporting cast material and, I was really happy with Jason O'Mara's brief appearance as Albert Wesker. But a little peeved that this was his only shot at the role (Shawn Roberts is hysterically awful with what he has to work with later).For as horrible as this film really is. I do enjoy how it tries to take advantage of its setting, and how it's finally willing to take chances by showing things not seen in a zombie movie yet. But still that's not saying much, and if they had shown just a little more of it this would be the best in the series (This is still before those horrendous 3-D outings).Final Verdict: Fairly decent when reminiscing, but still could've and should've been way better. 5/10.",5,0,2,7 August 2014
The Terminator," I'm Surprised That My Appreciation For The Movie Seems To Deepen Every Year.
","It's so crazy to think that James Cameron 'peaked' back in 1984 with 'The Terminator'. Of course the man has gone on to constantly top his achievements with stunning special effects, and the two highest grossing pictures of all time. But can you actually believe that Cameron had sold the rights for one dollar, and it has gone on to become one of the most popular movie franchises ever made?! A cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) from weapons program SKYNET, is sent back in time from the year 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of mankind's future saviour. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a soldier from the future is also sent back in time to save her. 'The Terminator' in a nutshell, is spectacular. From the 'Tech-Noir' style, the casting and immortal theme composed by Brad Fiedel. I can't begin to say how much this left an impression on me at 10 years old, albeit my parents sat me through the sequel first in order to see if I could handle this one. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn have a wonderful kind of chemistry, that doesn't fall into familiar mediocrity or the most absurd levels of an unexpected romance. But of course the whole movie is Arnold Schwarzenegger's playground, and boy does it look like fun to be in his shoes. What's left to say is that Cameron's shots remain ever present in my head, and Stan Winston's practical effects are still capable of making my friends stomach churn.Final Verdict: An icon of Science-fiction is born, and one of the best movies you can't wait to be old enough to watch (Luckily I managed to skip a couple years). 10/10.",10,4,5,15 October 2014
Snatch," Much Better Scripted Than The Average Modern British Gangster Movies.
","'Snatch', could possibly be the best of its kind as it is still often hailed and quoted today by many people. I can think of plenty straight to DVD releases that come out in Britain, and feel that just because you have a gun in your hand and a slightly off-putting cockney accent you'll be able to separate yourself from some pretty formulaic trash. Guy Ritchie has managed to construct something familiar like his previous work 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' (1998), as well as continue his distinctive visual style and dialogue heavy wit.Containing two intertwined plots. One deals with the search for a stolen diamond that many want to get their hands on, whereas the other features a small-time boxing promoter who finds himself pressured by a ruthless gangster. The storyline is always eventful, and half of it always feels like it hearkens back to old comedy films. That's not really a bad thing and to be honest, it does help bring out the opportunistic greed of every character.The final thing to mention is how well casted 'Snatch' is. By far the only reason to see this movie is Alan Torn's performance as foul mouthed, pig obsessed character Brick Top. You can't help but love a bastard so rotten, yet can hand your arse to you with the most philosophical nonsense ever. Heavy hitters like Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro and Jason Flemyng shine, and everybody else does admirable work whether your a fan or not.Final Verdict: When all is said and done, it has a great soundtrack and definitely remains worth seeing this ensemble cast succeed and fail their goals. 8/10.",8,0,3,15 October 2014
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," You Can't Fight Here, This Is The War Room
","Unfortunately I know that many people will not really enjoy what I have to say about Dr. Strangelove. I found it particularly enjoyable the first time around, but unfortunately the only reason to come back to it is for the Bomb Squad scenes and George C. Scott. I can't imagine how controversial it must have been for the time, but like a political cartoon it has its time and relevance. A lot of my family do not like Peter Sellers, or this movie at all and when showing this to a couple friends not too long ago they were not really impressed either (I was born in 1992, the Cold War was way beyond my time). Kubrick is my favourite director, but that doesn't mean I am also inclined to enjoy all his movies as well. Reasons I adore Kubrick are the many diverse genre movies he made, and his meticulous attention to detail. I think of all that wonderful hard work was not needed for a comedy of this calibre, but again the stories on set are quite charming. Kubrick wanted the War room table to be green like a poker table (Seeing as how these men were essentially gambling with the future in a black and white movie), Peter Sellers was originally set to play much more roles than the three he did, and he also had Kubrick rolling on the floor laughing in-between takes. Finally the original pie fight ending scene was scrapped for various reasons, ranging from being too farcical or unfortunately timed with President Kennedy's death by assassination.And honestly, I think I am right. I love that Kubrick attempted a comedy, and I think the movie is a wonderful classic and successful most of the running time. However as time goes by, this is the one Kubrick picture to me that will age the most. Of course this film would have been very risqué and controversial at the time of release, as it was a black comic adaptation of a very serious 1958 novel 'Red Alert' by Peter George. But aside from a few scenes, nothing really makes me laugh aloud and the acting really falls apart no matter how wonderful I think George C. Scott is.Still I guess the positive things to say is I could watch it again for things like the 'War room' set, which was great after so many iterations were developed off screen. Again, I did not hate this movie and the whole thing is a wonderful farce which I guess what was Kubrick's intention to show us in the first place (Believe me if the Cold War could be remembered as just a farce, Oh what a dream it would all be). Maybe as I get older some of it will grow on me, but I don't think I will change my opinion of it lightly. If the movie has anything going for it, I would say it possibly has the greatest end credit sequences of all time.Final Verdict: Obscurely enough, I found an old review I wrote at 18 writing how much I loved this movie. As I get older it just doesn't hit as high a note for me anymore. It's a political cartoon realised, and I would advise everyone to at least watch it once. 7/10.",7,0,3,12 February 2014
Alien," Arguably The Best Sci-Fi Horror Ever Made.
","I am 22 and what can I say about this movie? If there's anything I can say, 'Alien' is the film I ask every adult about how they felt at the time of the movies release. My dad went to go see it and reminds me it was one of his fondest memories as a moviegoer. Based on the highly sexualised pieces by surrealist H.R Giger. He & Ridley Scott have arguably created science fiction's greatest villain, in a movie series that has been adapted to comics, video games etc. The list goes on.Workers of the spaceship 'Nostromo', pick up a distress signal on a nearby planet and reluctantly respond. One unlucky worker (Lets face it) ends up raped via a strange species wrapped tight around his face, and removal seems futile as the creatures blood is highly corrosive. Eventually it falls off and everything seems back to normal, then the stuff of your deepest nightmares happen and suddenly your trapped in a cage with a savage life form.Still, John Hurt's death is the highlight of the movie, if not one of the most iconic in all of cinema. Hilarious it is to know, that none of the actors knew what was going to happen. Hurt, Ian Holm and of course Sigourney Weaver deliver their career best performances.And of course, I want to say how this movie personally affects me. The 'Alien' franchise was one of the last movie serials me and my family all viewed together, before various members went off to start their own families (Though we started with 'Aliens', it didn't matter). After finally viewing 'Alien' and seeing how Ridley created a movie set in tight corridors where the walls hiss and bellow smoke at you, nothing and nobody was safe. Ripley is without doubt cinemas greatest heroine and her fears become yours, rarely do movies give their characters such engrossing traits.Final Verdict: Alien only gets better with age and viewing. Utterly fantastic cinema you should be watching, as there will never be anything like it. 10/10. Do yourself a favour and check out the early trailers.",10,1,3,28 June 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," In An Ever Growing Wave Of Musicals, 'Sweeny Todd' Gets The Right Treatment.
","No doubt Tim Burton's goriest movie, and you can even get a beat out of it.One thing I still have yet to do is start watching musicals. It's not that I think Rodgers & Hammerstein are bad, there contributions to the genre are legendary. Unfortunately, the genre in the 2000's have had to endure Disney's 'High School Musical' franchise, and a lot of other stuff that wasn't really ever on my 'to see' list.However, Johnny Depp nails what could be Burton's darkest movie yet. Gothic London looks dirty and dark, making great settings for songs that are bleak with revenge and remorse. What little the plot is regarding the original 'Sweeny Todd' story, the duet with the incredible Alan Rickman is the films highlight and to this day it's still stuck in my head. A fantastic job by Stephen Soundheim.The only complaint's I have is that there are three or so songs I do not particularly enjoy. Even though I enjoyed Depp's performance, the characters motivation in this portrayal destroys opportunity for any further engrossing traits. If there's anything to say more about the picture, is that everyone is perfectly casted. From Timothy Spall to Sacha Baron Cohen, everyone gives a great performance and helps seem to elevate the picture way beyond expectations.Final Verdict: One of Tim Burton's Best. 8/10.",8,0,0,25 July 2014
Battleship Potemkin," A Movie That Seamlessly Blends Each Montage Perfectly.
","Sergei Eisenstein's 'Battleship Potemkin', is one of the more tolerable Propaganda movies of it's era. Presenting a dramatised version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905, when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their officers of the Tsarist regime.Throughout it's five episode structure, the pacing is impeccable as events unfold and clearly the situation spirals out of control. The most infamous segment 'The Odessa Staircase', is pretty much unforgettable in terms of imagery even though it never happened (Much of it inspired artist Francis Bacon and Brian De Palma's 'The Untouchables', 1987). Eisenstein's method proved very experimental and was met with mixed results, but definitely proved to be long lasting. It didn't go on to inspire the masses, yet more or less it offended them due to it's scenes of violence which were considered graphic at the time.Final Verdict: It remains one of the most influential films you should definitely see. Due to it's effectiveness of demonstrating early pioneering techniques of montage, and for being a very strong piece for it's time. 8/10.",8,0,0,29 August 2014
Taxi Driver," You Talking to Me?! Read On This...
","Quite possibly the greatest character study of a man's descent into madness. 'Taxi Driver' came screaming out of 1976 winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and showcasing the talents of two youths from the Bronx. Writer Paul Schrader wrote the script in less than a week, and was heavily influenced by the self narration and themes of Robert Bresson's 'Pickpocket' (1959). He, De Niro and Scorsese would go on and change the face of 1970's American cinema drastically.To those who have seen it, I think everyone can understand and connect on some level with Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro at his finest). A troubled mind isolated from the outside world, addicted to porn and 'supposedly' back from the Vietnam War. Suffering insomnia and chronic pill popping, he decides that if he wanders around aimlessly at night anyway he might as well get paid for it. He takes a job as a taxi driver, working over hours and traversing all city zones. Unfortunately for Travis these kind of late hours expose himself to the 'filth' of New York, that was literally at the time porno theatres, prostitution and drug dealers etc.All this we see through his eyes, and we vaguely connect with the kind of hatred he feels (A little hypocritical because he also watches porn compulsively). After unsuccessfully trying to court political campaign volunteer Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), he frequently ends up bumping into the life of Iris (Jodie Foster), a 12 year old prostitute (Her pimp is played by the enigmatic Harvey Kietel). After realising he is truly alone and unable to shake off his worries even with the advice from other taxi drivers (Amongst them acting legend Peter Boyle), Travis ultimately snaps and decides to take the law into his own hands.What follows is a plethora of famous movie quotes, and Robert De Niro's tour-de force performance. Filled with motifs and themes what with the Mohawk haircut (Based on real accounts of soldiers after Vietnam), Travis's alleged racism and circumstances where he could have easily been hailed as public enemy no. 1 instead of a hero. Paul Schrader revealed that the script's hidden message was for Travis to try and successfully kill the father figure of the women he knows (Infamously John Hinckley Jr. tried to assassinate Reagan in 1981, in a bid to impress Jodie Foster after watching the movie). All of which leads to an ending that has been debatable over the years, yet a somewhat redemption at least lies for our fallen cabbie. No other film has ever depicted New York quite like 'Taxi Driver' since. It's also one of the movies that you can successfully share the characters feelings of loneliness and possibly find some kind reassurance that even Hollywood leading actors can feel sad now and then. The camera flows through the simple narrative, and Scorsese employs the right kind of close ups at the right time (The scene Martin declared the most important is where Travis grovels down the phone and the camera moves to the right, because it is to pathetic to bear). Hitchcock composer Bernard Herrmann's haunting final score that plays throughout is my all-time favourite piece of movie music, because I love Jazz and it accompanies the lit up nightlife and credit scenes beautifully (Albeit it's played a little too much throughout the movie).Final Verdict: If I were to ever make a top favourite list, 'Taxi Driver' would most definitely be in my top 5 (A little unhealthy I know). De Niro is flawless, and Director Martin Scorsese's camera work makes it all look effortless. The narrative and setting all feels self contained, but the slow progression of madness feels that anything could eventually happen. 10/10. There really isn't anything else quite like it.",10,0,0,16 November 2013
Shutter Island," More Than Faithful Adaptation Of The Dennis Luhane Novel.
","'Shutter Island' is another brilliant outing from Martin Scorsese. The month prior to the release I managed to pick up the original book, and was thoroughly looking forward to what direction the production may take.U.S. Marshal Edward 'Teddy' Daniels (DiCaprio), and his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), go to Shutter Island on a ferry boat to the home of Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. Investigating the disappearance of a patient Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), who has escaped the hospital and apparently the island despite being in a locked cell under supervision.As far as execution goes, 'Shutter Island' is adapted to a tee. I now get the feeling Leonardo DiCaprio is beginning to pick his performances more carefully. He has always been a solid performer, and this role definitely gives him more of a chance to use every emotion under the sun considering the situation. Also it was very pleasant to finally see Ben Kingsley in a Scorsese picture, and it's a very interesting choice for the role of Dr. Cawley. But as always, Sir Kingsley delivers solid work.The island overall looks like a visually perfect adaption from book to screen. The lack of lighting, weird sound effects and constant dream sequences all in all make this very exciting and disturbing thriller highly recommended.Final Verdict: A very well crafted movie. It's not the best Scorsese has ever done, but decent nevertheless. 8/10.",8,1,2,16 August 2014
Interstellar," Part Of Me Thinks My Love For 'Interstellar' May Deepen Over Time..
","Hopefully when you're reading this, you'll have seen the movie and tried to take in all of Interstellar's extremely ambitious U-turns and stunning visuals. By the time the credits role, there was lot left to be desired. But how jaw dropping a final act it was, that I'm glad Christopher Nolan decided to try and reach for the stars, then not try at all. Immediately I thought back to the first trailer in December 2013, where the use of stock footage, Hans Zimmer, Matthew McConaughey's voice and the tag-line 'One Year From Now' was all I needed to peak my interest. Of course our interests were fuelled all the more, when they started to show planets and locations in further trailers closer to the films release. Personally I wish they held back a little in marketing, just because that would have had so much more of an impact whilst viewing the movie.In the 'near' future, Earth is no longer sustainable to humanity. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA test pilot turned framer, reluctantly joins a team of space travellers, who plan to travel through a newly discovered wormhole in search of a new habitable planet. His plans to go on this quest pretty much destroys his relationship with his children, for which making amends is the only driving force for Cooper to return home. As he and the crew bravely venture above and beyond what they could've imagined.In terms of visuals, the movie is 10/10 gorgeous. It can easily be Christopher Nolan's best looking movie, and the fact that all of it is practical sets and locations like Iceland etc. Cannot help but leave a deep impression. Again, the ambitious nature of this production overall will inevitably lead to some stellar cinematography, but every time we were aboard the main ship (The 'Endurance') I just wanted to reach out and touch a dashboard or study the cryogenic beds. Special effects are scarce, yet the ones created are actual visual representations from algorithms by Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who was also the executive producer. There's a plethora of connections to be made instantly with '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968), but frankly I just wanted to mention the homages to the 'Monolith', in the form of the two on-board robots who shined in their 'resourcefulness'.But onto the narrative, which is where 'Interstellar' seems to dip and dive. Ultimately the journey became wonderfully whole, and a certain story arc that infuriated me in the beginning lessened it's grip overall. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan love to introduce a recurring theme of 'meta-fictive' narration in their films, and all of this is present in a stellar filmography that has definitely found an audience. 'Interstellar' has this feat, yet the primary focus of the piece seems to be 'Love'. The love Cooper has to want to get back to his kids is identifiable, if not cliché and shamelessly forced in some emotional moments. But there's a scene when Anne Hathaway's character is explaining the scientists concept that love transcends time and space, it really took me out of the moment as I waited for the following scene to appear. In short, love is magic and hasn't that been done to death?Hans Zimmer teams up with Christopher Nolan again to compose the music. Though the use of a certain song is used repetitiously throughout, it's another fantastic score we've come to expect from Zimmer and I'm still waiting to hear the remainder of the soundtrack. There are moments where the dialogue and music are at the same pitch, which becomes harder to hear and it usually happens when something extremely loud is happening in the scene. It can become infuriating when trying to hear what they say, even more so when the movie can become quiet in an instant and replicate dialogue straight from actual astronaut footage to brilliant effect. There are music cues that easily spoil the build up when someone does something out of character (What movie isn't guilty of that?), but a lot of the movie shows the musical restraint that Nolan executes particularly well.And lastly, I want to say that every actor was superb. For all you have heard me attack certain moments of the script, and how some of the characters and scenarios have been delivered. I can confidently say there is not one weak link in this entire star-studded cast. Matthew McConaughey is just getting better and better with each role, and he really is the heart and driving force of the movie. John Lithgow, Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, A surprise cameo from a certain A-list talent and Michael Caine all wonderfully bounce off each other and make it 'effortless'. Lastly the child acting was very strong, and Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck blend into their characters seamlessly.Final Verdict: Visually stunning, though I consider 'Interstellar' to have some minor flaws. It's concept, ideology and results are nothing more than what I would expect from a Christopher Nolan film, and I'm so happy he went above and beyond regardless of those few minor flaws. It's one of my favourite movies of the year and as always, I thoroughly look forward to Nolan's future outcomes. 8.5/10.",7,0,2,10 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," A Harrowing Look Of Vietnam, Outside Of The Jungle.
","In many ways, it's the last of the many War movies to come out based upon Vietnam such as 'The Deer Hunter' (1978), 'Apocalypse Now' (1979) & 'Platoon' (1986). Stanley Kubrick, the great innovator known for spending years on his craft had been surpassed by many award winning movies. Still like many of Stanley's movies that are initially despised upon release, are years later lauded as masterpieces beyond the scope of a mere camera lens. 'Full Metal Jacket', I feel represents Stanley working at his most un-prohibited in terms of humanities greatest flaw. After seeing through the bitter eyes of General Kirk Douglas in 'Paths Of Glory' (1957), and the Superpowers of 'Dr. Strangelove' (1964) we finally get to see what really matters. The soldiers coming to terms: 'In a world of sh*t'.The first act shows our cast of heroes begin their vigorous training into dehumanised killers, led by the 'cruel, but fair' leader Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (Real life drill instructor Lee Ermy). Training goes well for all, except one Private definitely lacking in any physical advantages and whose shortcomings begin to cost the squad dearly. Eventually our lead character 'Joker' (Matthew Modine), is eventually dispatched into Vietnam. From then on there are reunions with former comrades, sadistic peers and total disregard for human life on both sides. Tense and unnerving, the performances are worth the reasons of viewing alone. Whilst not the most quotable and recognised of the Vietnam depictions, Kubrick's camera-work is as sublime as ever, and it's hard not to be totally engrossed on how London's Beckton Gas Works got turned into Vietnamese soil.Final Verdict: Essential Kubrick. If that isn't reason enough, I don't know what is. 8/10.",8,0,1,7 December 2013
Ant-Man," What's Good Is Great, But Could It Have Been Better?
","The end of Marvel's 'Phase 2', work began on an adaptation of 'Ant-Man' in 2006 with Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish. Wright had unfortunately left the project in 2014, creative differences between him and Marvel has been cited as the reason (A shame as Joss Whedon of 'Avengers' fame declared it 'Not only the best script that Marvel had ever had, but the most Marvel script I'd read'). Director Peyton Reed was brought on to finish the project, along with more script work by Director Adam McKay and the films leading actor Paul Rudd. At the end of all this unfortunate mess Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish still share a co-writing credit, and while I loved the final movie and its many spectacular sequences I was in my seat wondering how much of Edgar Wright's unique visual flair survived, or what could have been.Still I will not be rude anymore and give credit where credit is due, Peyton Reed absolutely nailed it. Marvel has managed to actually pull off a thrilling heist movie, and the comedy is a fine balancing act between dialogue and action sequences. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the 1st Ant-man has done well over the years keeping his kit away from those he does not deem worthy. Enter Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a recently released convict planning to clean up his act for the sake of his daughter. Problems arise where he must return to crime for financial reasons and Hank finally sees potential in Scott as the next Ant-man, much to the dismay of Pym's daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly). What follows is a daring plan against an old protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), and with help like Luis (A hilarious performance from Michael Peña) how could things go wrong?While unfortunately the plot unfolds with moments you have seen done to death in cinema history, the pro's far out way the con's. As a reader of the comic I would have loved to have seen the more arrogant and brutal depiction of Hank Pym that is usually given (Remember that this character accidentally created 'Ultron' in the books), but Michael Douglas does a wonderful job and as soon as I saw him up on screen I remembered why the man has such a strong presence on camera. Paul Rudd finally gets a break with somewhat serious leading man material and he does splendid with it, I could not agree more with this casting decision. Evangeline Lilly did good as well, but the forced trauma between her character and Douglas's is such drivel I got tired of it pretty fast. It gave minimal depth to their characters, and don't tell me it was powerful stuff when it can be cleared up in a 2-3 minute 'your Mother' scene every blockbuster seems to have. Stoll as the main villain suits the mood of the movie, but again is underdeveloped and evil just for the sake of chasing profit and spite against Pym (In writing all this down maybe they actually did more justice to Hank Pym than I give them credit for).So after discussing casting, what redeems this movie for me is how creative all the action sequences truly get (No kidding, quite possibly the best I've ever seen from the Superhero genre). As soon as that suit powered on I was reminded of classics like 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' (1957), and there was even a little '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) nostalgia for me. The CGI ants surprisingly look and move the right way what with the 10, 100's or 1,000's that eventually show up on screen, and after everything I've said the only serious disappointment I had is that Ant-man never got to grow super huge (I'm pretty sure that wasn't a budget thing, and I doubt someone at Marvel would've found it too 'outlandish' given all the preceding events so far).Final Verdict: Marvel continues to play the game well when it comes to popularising somewhat obscure characters, and every actor delivered on the action and comedy in a smart and clever way. Easily I look forward to seeing this character in his next appearance, and this could be the most fun and accessible movie Marvel has made yet. 7/10.",7,0,2,27 July 2015
The Godfather: Part II," 'The Godfather Part II', Is The Prime Example Of How Sequels Should Be Made.
","Mario Puzo's epic 'The Godfather' novel, has gone on to set high standards in both literature and cinema. Considering how the first one had managed to encapsulate so very well it's 'Welcome to the Family' ideology. It gives the sequel a chance to now stand on its own two feet, without the necessities of an origin story.Well it actually turns out we need those origin chapters more than ever. We are shown the past of how Vito Corleone, became the Don, in contrast of his son Micheal (Al Pacino). Usually watching any flashback sequence in a movie feels so hard for me to get into, it happens so abruptly it feels less like an aid to the story but more of a throw in. Francis Ford Coppola's execution is genius, because watching Vito's upbringing is shown and depicted perfectly with the 'Sepia' feel, murky streets of little Italy and a Oscar winning performance from a then unknown Robert De Niro. Seeing this perfectly executed with Michael's story in comparison, it just instantly draws us in so well there's not many other films that do it this well.Following the 'current events' of the movie. Michael is slowly growing distant from the family, and ultimately paranoia is settling in without help from the older, weaker brother Fredo (A truly incredible performance from the late John Cazale). By the time things escalate towards the end of the film, the family is ultimately destroyed. Michael has officially isolated himself from both his own family and the other families, leaving him quiet and reminiscing. It is here we ask: 'Do we see Micheal as a man with a blood lust, or a tragic soul'? Your choice. 'The Godfather Part II' is a stunning sequel, feeling more like a 7 hour long epic rather than a trilogy. But if you loved the first movie, I would not be hesitant to watch this one. It is one of Coppola's finest pieces of writing and cinematography .Final Verdict: The American dream is continuously turned on its head, in this more than perfect sequel. 10/10.",10,1,2,30 August 2014
Predator," The Most Quotable Schwarzenegger Ever.
","'Predator' is in every sense of the word, a 1980's action fans wet dream. Most definitely a lot of one liners spawned from this movie, which has the styling's of a 1950's Sci-Fi classic and a typical 1980's slasher yarn.The film is obviously quite over the top. I find the pacing boring and almost unbearable during the first half. What begins as a movie about a small group of ragtag, testosterone guerrilla fighters, eventually becomes a fight for survival against an alien created by Stan Winston, with input from James Cameron (True story).Arnold is delightfully cheesy as always, and he really is the only reason to see this movie for all his one liners and the final battle. I guess I should mention Carl Weathers as well and the fact Shane Black wrote part of the flick (Uncredited), who obviously went on to great success with 'Lethal Weapon', and a string of Hollywood blockbusters.Final Verdict: The 'Predator' franchise has always felt no more than classic B-movie serials, but therein lies the charm and the reason they have endured for so long. 7/10. It's a lot of fun when you don't take it too seriously, but I just don't have a lot to say about it.",7,0,1,24 July 2014
Watchmen," A Book Of Substance Gets A Movie Of Style, And Style Is The Only Thing Truly Present.
","Without doubt I consider 'Watchmen' one of the best American comic books I've ever read. I got round to reading it at the of 17 in 2009, and found that its large amounts of praise in the industry is actually pretty deserving. Alan Moore's dissection of the characters in this alternate Cold War time line has gone on to be both influential and hilariously parodied in the mediums growth. To finally see it hit the screen after hearing that it has been in development since 1986 was a dream come true, yet how well could Zack Snyder pull this off?'Very well' would be my two cents. Zack's films have always been more heavily focused on visual flair than strong narrative, and although it takes small, yet certain liberties it carries itself well throughout the movies lengthy running time. It would have been amazing to see the book's finale on the big screen, but script writer David Hayter ('X-Men', 'X2') does admirable service to the source material. An 'Ultimate Cut' also incorporates the story within a story narrative, and runs at an astonishing 215 minutes. Not many comic book movies get such privilege.In an alternate time line where powerless heroes fought crimes in the 1940's. Nixon won the election in the 1980's thanks to the intervention of the Vietnam war, where an individual with super powers ended it swiftly. This caused worse tensions between the Russians during the Cold War, and causes an act to be passed banning vigilantism. However, a certain paranoid anti-hero believes a conspiracy within the lines that may also involve the fate of his old allies, and could effect the overall fate of the world's situation.Surprisingly dark and very well acted, the movie without doubt has some very unique set pieces. Rain drenches the city, popular music of the time blares throughout, shadows look menacing and overall every actor delivers solid performances with what they have (The movie does well at avoiding big names). I think my main concern with the movie is that a large amount of information from the book feels missing, or is overshadowed by the visual flairs and I just cannot determine whether they were suitable or not. Of course Alan Moore has been very open with his thoughts upon movie adaptations of his work, I myself hated what has been done with all of them. As of 2015, I think that Zack is a fine filmmaker who has done well working on comic book movies for the last decade. But all in all I find every narrative he has worked with underwhelming compared to his visual style, and as I said earlier I'm just at this bizarre crossroads the more I analyse and reflect back on them. I would have preferred a preference on story given this particular source material, but talents such as Terry Gilliam, Darren Aronofsky, Arnold Schwarzenegger and even Robin Williams had been approach throughout the years and somewhat had difficulty breaking down elements of the story and trying to make it work.Final Verdict: The opening with the incredible rendition of Nat King Cole's 'Unforgettable', is a stunningly well choreographed introduction I never tire of seeing. 'Watchmen' was the best superhero film of the year, and although it didn't make large amounts of money on the original box office run, it has gained a large cult following and hopefully introduced more people to a stellar book I recommend reading. 8/10. I do not think that the book is 'Un-filmable', and given that Hollywood seems to be rebooting everything much sooner these days, who knows what the future holds for adapting 'Watchmen'?",8,1,3,19 June 2014
The Matrix Revolutions," Way Too Overblown In It's Mythology
","In some ways I considered some small things in 'Revolutions', to be better than 'Reloaded'. But ultimately it leaves more questions left unanswered, and I found it lacking enough material for its 2 hour running time. For a finale in a very well received trilogy that spawned plenty of merchandise and even a new fashion sense, 'Revolutions' hasn't aged well for me and represented the turning point where the series would become a shell of it's former self.I like certain elements of the story in this one as we spend more time in the 'real world', preparing for a war that has been talked about since the beginning. The time spent in 'The Matrix' is pretty slow, yet the finale is anything but. For as much as everything feels very anticlimactic, it definitely can't help but feel like it tries to answer questions that aren't going to fulfil expectations regardless how brilliant they could possibly be.The Wachowski siblings end things well enough. The atmosphere looks edgy, and the choreography and slow motion really help depict the odds against Neo (Keanu Reeves). But after all I've said, I can't really find any other strong reasons to say the finale is a must see. I loved it as a kid, but on repeated viewings years later it just doesn't hold up.Final Verdict: Ending everything well enough to say it isn't a horrible movie, but 'anticlimactic' best sums up 'The Matrix Revolutions'. 5/10.",5,2,4,12 September 2014
The Thing," Are You The Thing? OK, Are You? Maybe...
","It's a pleasure to review this movie as I have seen it so many times. Even more so, since recently I showed it to my 21 year old friend for the first time. Had you been there for the amount of 'NOOOO', (Gasps), 'WHAT' & 'OH MY GOD' reactions, all of which left me in tears. It proves that John Carpenter's gross out remake of this 1950's Sci-Fi classic, continues to work its magic even today.Based on the short story 'Who Goes There?' by John W. Campbell. A group of researchers in Antarctica, stumble across an alien life form at an abandoned post. You never fully see it, and it can assimilate its host whilst picking them off one by one. From there on tension rises, and trusts are tested. Leading to some of the most jaw dropping, gruesome creature effects ever committed to cinema.Watching this recently in the Blu-ray format, just shows how timeless this movie really is. Kurt Russell brings us an incredibly likable anti-hero, whose most prominent scene stealing moment is the legendary 'Blood Test' scene. All this with Rob Bottin's spectacular creature effects, and Ennio Morricone's tense heart beating soundtrack paints 'Antarctica' as if it was another planet (Actually frozen sound stages in Los Angeles, and British Columbia).Final Verdict: 'Halloween' (1978) is a classic, but 'The Thing' is John Carpenter's masterpiece. It continues to remain superior, regardless of any recent sequel-prequel homages. 9/10. Brilliant Sci-fi Horror.",9,2,5,7 December 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Why Two Parts? Either Way, The Finale Is Around The Corridor.
","Upon hearing of a 2-part finale, as well as the conversion to 3-D. Your instant thought, or at least mine and many other peoples were 'Is it really necessary'? Well luckily for us, they couldn't convert it to 3D in time for it's release date. to be honest I'm all up for a 2-part finale, as long as the get every bit in and send an incredibly beloved series off right.It was a bold move, and after watching 'Part 2'. I can confidently say that the 3D was completely unnecessary, and they could have easily gotten away with one movie. The only thing I can say wrong about 'Part 1' is the pacing. It starts off well, and then we're stuck in the woods for two hours. It's incredibly slow and where it ends never really bothered me, but it can't help but be crippled by how much they would get done in the second.Another thing I found strange, was that virtually out of nowhere dance that happens between Harry and Hermione. It's not bad or worth anything of a critical backlash, but it was just as awkward for us as it was for them. Aside from that it was really good. The trio are not going back to Hogwarts, and instead are on a private mission to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Tensions arise between the three in all kinds of various landscapes, as well as the head bureaucracy of wizards itself.Final Verdict: The acting was good, by this point it was so good to see that the final newcomers to the series would be Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans. Sadly though, this was also the time to be saying goodbye to Harry and his friends, as the finale would not even give you the time to do so. 7/10.",7,1,3,29 August 2014
The Shining," A Ghost Story? A Psychological Horror? Either Way It Gets Better With Age.
","Well, If there was anything that hasn't been said about 'The Shining' I've yet to hear it. After watching the absurd 'Room 237' (2012) documentary, it proves that this movie continues to age extraordinarily well considering how many people continue to interpret it. To me and 15-20 of my mates who have sat down and watch this so many times, I decided it's best to take it for what it is. Read into it lightly at the beginning, and dissect it in depth on repeated viewings.As far as plot goes, it strays FAR from the source material and Stephen King is known to not be a fan of it (Once declaring Kubrick's treatment of Wendy as one of the greatest misogynistic portrayals of woman in film ever). A surprisingly thin premise, a man who has taken up a care taker position of a hotel for the winter, eventually loses his sanity and endangers his family. Like all of Kubrick's work, the film is shot so well it captures a unique look that I love about the camera in general. It becomes the ghost, and other perspectives in the room. That's not my interpretation on just this movie, that's my quasi-opinion on all movies in general. This one just happens to be shot by a master of his craft, and that opening with the sweeping tracking shot of the mountains screams ghost doesn't it?And of course, it's another one of those films where Jack Nicholson just gives his absolute best. At the time where he was playing crazy a lot and actually gave up remembering his lines due to the ever changing script, I believe he STILL makes the role his own & unique. What TALENT Mr. Nicholson possesses, and I don't think this picture would have aged so well without him. Shelley Duvall does very well, and course the arguments with Kubrick on set clearly show what lengths she had to put herself through. Even to this day how they managed to film around Danny (Danny Lloyd) and make him not realise he was in a horror film baffles me.I consider 'The Shining' to be the first psychological horror film I ever saw (This was pre 'Cat People', 'Persona' & 'Les Diaboliques'). To me it falls more into the realm of an art-house film, yet the sense of lost and isolation portrayed including the mental effects YOU may possibly feel, have never really felt quite surpassed. The film has the same look as a TV miniseries, trudges along at a snails pace, and I always found the whole experience humorously nonchalant when it came to lacking the usual large opening credits. It's charming to know that Harry Dean Stanton almost played Lloyd the bartender, and that Kubrick sat everyone down and made them watch 'Eraserhead' (1977) to emulate such a heavy atmosphere.Final Verdict: Not really horror, and not entirely scary. 'The Shining' is more about testing the meta of the horror genre, and evaluating the results. Those results really show in the eyes and thoughts of each individual. Anyone can write or talk about it, but to actually experience it is something else entirely. 10/10. Essential viewing if you love the genre.",10,3,6,21 June 2014
"I, Robot"," This Film Isn't Going Anywhere.
","With many of these Blockbuster films that came out in the mid 2000's, I ended up pretty much giving them a 7/10. I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed Roland Emmerich's 'The Day after Tomorrow', and both of these movies ended up being part of the family DVD collection. Since then, I've ended up doing a little research and realised that 'I, Robot' shares very little with it's source material, but then is one of those adaptations that strangely never bothered me.In 2035, robots are used as servants for almost everything, and none seem to display any negativity or objection. Programmed with the three Laws of robotics directives: Never harm a human or let a human come to harm, always obey humans unless this violates the first Law and finally to protect its own existence (Unless this violates the First or Second Laws). The co-founder of U. S. Robotics, dies after falling several stories from his office window. His death is ruled as suicide, but Detective Spooner (Will Smith), who knew Lanning as a friend believes otherwise.Will Smith is very good as a hard-nut detective. Of course he is one of the most likable stars and I had hoped from all the trailers and marketing they showed, he would keep it up consistency throughout the films running time and he really did. Alan Tudyk did a wonderful job as the voice of Sonny. I'm really glad that the character is developed so well, but I wish there had been more screen time dedicated to him. The female scientist played by Bridget Moynahan however, looked pretty lost when it came to filming certain scenes and feels greatly underwritten.Final Verdict: If you're looking for a decent pop-corn flick, 'I, Robot' will more than enough satisfy. However, I don't think it's going to entertain enough to live a longer life than the year it came out. 7/10.",7,2,2,26 August 2014
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Big Blockbuster Sequel Done Right.
","The special effects are incredible. It's funny how I said that as a kid over a decade ago, and that still ultimately sums up the movie for me. James Cameron pioneered an incredible franchise on a shoestring budget, and to see what he's capable of with a large sum doesn't end up sacrificing too much of the series quality.Considering how tense the direction of the first movie was by being a slasher 'Tech-Noir' movie, that was slapped with an 18 rating. 'T2' ended up a 15, mostly to what I imagined as getting as many people in the seats as possible. Which is fair enough as they finally put big money into the picture. I bring this up because ultimately I saw this one first as a kind of 'initiation', to be able to convince my parents to let me see the first one.Well age has hardened me, and I have to admit this movie still remains a classic. But I began to prefer the likes of the first movie more over time. Edward Furlong infuriates me now as an adult, and Linda Hamilton puts in a very well albeit over acted performance. It's obvious from the start both Arnold Schwarzenegger & Robert Patrick will have to hold the movie together, and they really do. Both characters become titans, and the make up effects be it real or digital is just insane.What can I say about the plot? Bad terminator comes from future to kill John Connor, so bad terminator from first movie gets reprogrammed into good terminator to save him. In their way stands motorways, mental hospitals, corporations and steel mills. Stick in some 'Guns & Roses', and it all absurdly works. Other than that, it's wonderful and silly but it feels overall smart. This is a great bar to what blockbusters should be, and James Cameron constantly manages to reinvent his filmography without having to rely on too many old tricks. They even adapted it into a highly rated theme park ride for gods sake.Final Verdict: It was a movie that made me want to make robots as a kid, and one of those sequels which really define the genre. 8/10.",8,1,1,11 July 2014
Apocalypse Now," An Absolute 'Must-See' Experience.
","This is my full review of this legendary picture. Whilst the original is a classic, I saw the 'Redux' first and was blown away by the new material incorporated (Maybe the French plantation stuff still could've been left out). Obviously any film enthusiast can agree that 'Apocalypse Now' is essentially a film like no other. A tense hallucinogenic, physically exhausting movie which can only be described as part War, and something else entirely towards its conclusion. It is something hard to describe unless you see it, and even then I find the experience hard to put down into words.One thing I love about this movie is the success it had after going against all odds during production. For those who don't know Brando showed up too overweight, was reportedly very hard to work with and would require a body double during day scenes. Harvey Keitel was replaced by Martin Sheen a few weeks into filming, and Sheen had a heart attack at the age of 36 only to return to work a month later. What would be a 16-week shoot, took over 239 days of sweat & torture. Typhoon Olga destroyed many expensive sets, extras & the crew got malaria and many other diseases. Sam Bottoms (The actor who plays Lance), was constantly on drugs while shooting and Martin Sheen's brother did half of the voice-over narrative due to his brother's sickness. The killing of the water buffalo attracted obvious animal protection laws, and the ending was re-written countless times as Coppola had to make a film out of 2300 hours of recorded footage. Of course for obvious reasons, Francis Ford Coppola threatened suicide countless times. That's just a handful of problems and stuff that happened, if you're interested in learning more, I extremely recommend watching Eleanor Coppola's documentary 'Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse' (1991). Based on the 1899 classic novel 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad. The story revolves around ivory trading, colonialism, cruelty, humanity and obsession. All this seems more than fitting to be adapted into a War tale. Finally beginning the movie, helicopters fly across a burning jungle all while 'The End' by The Doors plays in the background. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is drunk, drugged out and wasting away in a room in Saigon (Anyone anxious to know this was shot on Martin's 36th Birthday, who actually WAS drunk and drugged out when he told Copolla to film what was happening and leave him to it. What happens as you see on screen he actually broke the mirror, bled out then reportedly attacked Francis. The crew were so frightened they wanted to stop yet, he ordered Coppola to continue filming). Being called upon by Generals (Most notably a cameo by Harrison Ford, under the name 'Lucas'), he is ordered to exterminate 'with extreme prejudice' General Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando), A Green Beret who has gone AWOL.What follows is Willard's mission up the Vietnamese river, on the boat he narrates his views on the War and Kurtz in the dossier given to him, questioning his respect for Kurtz as well as his mission. With his crew (Amongst them is Laurence Fishburne in his first role), all of them witness the horrors of the War and the one vital lesson: 'Never get off the boat'. On their journey they encounter a kind, yet insane Seargent Kilgore (A manic performance by Robert Duvall, who utters my favourite movie quote 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning'). They also have to contend with fellow soldiers, animals and even Playboy Bunnies (Including real-life playmate of the year Cynthia Wood).Throughout the picture Kurtz is seen as a some what God-like figure to those around him, especially by an all too literal American photographer (An expertly casted Dennis Hopper). Seeing Kurtz for the first time is probably one of the most chilling, tense and surreal moments in motion picture history, and by the end of the movie Willard's goals and possibly your original thoughts are left so askew everything comes to close and certain fates are left unknown. Was the mission a success or what is the unexpected fallout after such events? Will Willard be destined to follow in Kurtz's footsteps?In terms of negativity, I would like to throw in Stanley Kubrick's Interview with Michèle Halberstadt, October 1987. Kubrick: 'I think that Coppola was stuck by the fact that he didn't have anything that resembled a story. So he had to make each scene more spectacular than the one before, to the point of absurdity. 'The ending is so unreal, and purely spectacular, that it's like a version, much improved, of King Kong (laughs). And Brando is supposed to give an intellectual weight to the whole thing 'I think it just didn't work. But it's terrifically done. And there are some very strong scenes.'Final Verdict: On the plus side it should be noted that many people who have seen it have declared it accurate to how it was like experiencing Vietnam. On the negative I would also say the films structure is so out of the directors hand given the events that happened behind the camera. What I can declare definitively is that Francis Ford Coppola manage to build something unforgettable with what should have been an absolute disaster. How he did it I don't know, and therefore I would say thank you sir for what was such an astonishing success and failure. 10/10. I guarantee there's never going to be anything like it again.",10,1,2,16 November 2013
Edward Scissorhands," Tim Burton's Best.
","Apparently 'Edward Scissorhands' was a very personal movie for Burton, the story was conceived when he was a child as he always felt like an outcast in suburban California. What isn't there to say about Johnny Depp? He's one of the greatest actors of our generation, and this marks the first of many collaborations with Tim. Both have gone on to create some of the most truly interesting characters of Gothic storytelling.An Inventor (The last performance by the wonderful Vincent Price) sadly passes away before he can finish his final work which is Edward, a robot who is all complete except for his hands which are scissors. Someone eventually drives to the abandoned mansion on top of the hill, and after finding Edward decides to take him home. Given the people in this film, I think everyone can somewhat connect to the isolation and thoughts of Edward. Everyone looks down on him, judge's him then makes up bull about him. It's disgusting to see how many snobs prey on his naiveté and shyness. I suppose you could argue that he wants to just be accepted within society, but the way some people act he's probably better off on his own.Even after everything, Edward remains the best person in the community. Though he is just really there to experience new things such as society and love, before he ultimately leaves it all behind for the better thus leaving a bigger impact within the community. I saw the film at 10 years old and I thought it was wonderful, essentially a modern take on the 'Frankenstein' story put through a cartoonish landscape. It's always so interesting to see how the most innocent can end up with so much hell through little lies, and just for being himself in such a destructive area. All these things are elevated through a wonderful score by Danny Elfman.Final Verdict: Probably the strongest Gothic film Tim Burton has to his name. It really is something bleak, yet beautiful. 8.5/10.",8,1,1,22 September 2014
Spider-Man," Succeeds Like A Spider Can.
","Finally, 'Spider-Man' makes his debut to the silver screen after all the 1970's Nicholas Hammond TV serials. How well has it been adapted? The casting is debatable even to this day when among my friends. Do you remember when Michael Keaton took heat for Tim Burton's 'Batman' (1989)? Well Tobey Maguire is constantly lauded and berated among my peers, but I personally think he did very well and continues to hold up nicely. No doubt I think he gave it his all in 'Spider-Man 2' (2004), whereas 'Spider-Man 3' (2007) feels no more than a burnout for everyone involved.Though Maguire remains a nice debate for fans, everyone else is casted brilliantly. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst hold their own as great supporting characters. J.K Simmons 'IS' J. Jonah Jameson and though William Dafoe is undeniably cheesy in his execution, he steals the show in every scene (That costume however is utter crap, and I highly recommend looking online for the original goblin designs).The action scenes are also very decent, yet the films dated CGI can be a little jarring nowadays. However, scenarios throughout the film kept it engaging as the 10 year old me was blown away at the times release, and it still remains one of my favourite movie going experiences. Though Sam Raimi deviates far from the original storyline, the characters motivations and morals stay true to the original source. It's awesome to see a director incorporate this kind of imaginative camera-work into this movie as he did his older work. Even the final battle arena echoed that of 'The Evil Dead' movies.Final Verdict: An American icon brings super heroes into the new millennium with stunning confidence. 8/10.",8,0,1,25 July 2014
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Alfonso Cuaron Works That Potter Magic.
","Considering that this is the only entry in the series that doesn't revolve around Lord Voldemort (As much). 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban', is the turning point. Introducing more talent, more characters and more thorough stories that will happen to effect Harry's life for the rest of the series.The story follows Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts, as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black, has escaped from Azkaban prison and wants to murder him. This leads to a series of ghouls known as 'Dementors' (Azkaban's guards) patrolling the school, whilst everyone remains unaware that Black has more involvement in Harry past than everybody seems to lead on.Finally, we get to see those exterior shots of Hogwarts re-imagined, a great enjoyment to see as I was never much a fan of the look from the first two movies. The introduction of Remus Lupin who is played brilliantly by David Thewlis, and stunning debut from Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore (R.I.P Richard Harris). But unsurprisingly, the character who ultimately steals the show is Sirius Black, played with charisma and desperation from Gary Oldman.Again, it's the first time we are introduced to a new kind of evil. That comes in the form of the shrieking shack, escaped convicts and somehow it even manages to include a sub-plot on a court case about a magical animals fate that coincides with the main narrative. All that's left to say is that great performances come from Daniel, Rupert & Emma. As the characters are becoming more fleshed out and definitely more vulnerable to all these dangers.Final Verdict: Alfonso Cuaron really adds a great style and edge to the franchise. Those who are fans of the books do not want to miss this very likable entry in the series. 8/10.",8,0,1,29 August 2014
The Lego Movie," Everything WAS Awesome!
","Well it happened. After a life time producing these wonderful little bricks dating all the way back to 1949, finally we get to see this toy giant get a movie release (Outside of their works based on popular franchises like 'Batman'). I ASSURE you movies based on toys and cartoons get released yearly, some to mixed reception and few to rave reviews. 'The Lego Movie' is so beautifully animated and well made, that I was in awe at how personal this film will be to each individual.I don't want to stress or further the message the film was trying to communicate with its audience because they'll easily get it, everyone will. What I do want to say is how much I praise the film-makers for seeing and going beyond the potential of what they could create with the source material. Being a bit older now than I probably would have liked to have seen it, I can say that it got to me not through catchy tunes or semi-funny jokes, but heavy nostalgia and sentimentality. I never had much LEGO growing up, but finally after amassing a large amount at the age of 16 I gave it all away to the son of a family friend who didn't have any. Therefore closing my loop, and looking back at those times with a smile (I still buy the occasional figure or two).Final Verdict: I can't really find a negative thing to say about the movie. The voice acting was stellar, and the animation was fluent and very frenetic at times. Chris Miller and Phil Lord did a very good job incorporating themes of individuality and group mentality, but I just thought that by the end any gender of any age should be able to enjoy this. 10/10. Warner Bros. may have just found their 'Toy Story'.",10,1,4,15 March 2014
Aliens," Oh No Aliens's? ses?
","If you need to read a review to validate a 5* movie of this calibre, then clearly you didn't get this movie or you haven't seen it yet. For shame sir! James Cameron had the insurmountable challenge to follow up Ridley Scott's epic 'Alien' (1979), and it was a suicide mission at best. How can you possibly top one of the most tense, scariest atmospheric movies ever depicted at the time? Well the next best thing works surprisingly well, by taking Sci-Fi's greatest slasher movie and turning it into a mini guerrilla war film. I know that sounds immature, but it so obviously works when it comes to big gun toting, foul-mouthed marines blasting aliens away. Where do you think the 1993 video game classic 'DOOM', would get its inspiration? AND YET considering its heavy emphasis on all out action, it carries a superb 3 act narrative that constantly becomes stronger & larger. Sigourney Weaver is again superb as ever, fully solidifying Ripley's character and status as Sci-Fi's greatest heroine. And finally, 'Aliens' introduces us to the colony and size of Sci-Fi's scariest alien race.On a budget of 18.5 million, THIS is the template movie every action blockbuster EVEN by todays standards should aspire to. It's a solid education, and one of the few sequels that works just as well as a stand alone title.Final Verdict: It doesn't have the nerve shredding fear that the first one so expertly depicted, but 'Aliens' will challenge you on how far you are willing to go with these soldiers efforts. Considering how bad this franchise eventually got, we'll always have these two staggering titans for decades to come. 10/10.",10,1,2,12 December 2013
Resident Evil," Something Went Wrong When Something Could've Been So Right.
","Paul W.S. Anderson once said: 'I don't think anyone knows more about Resdient Evil than I do'.Well that's certainly crap, because we should have gotten a better film. Zombie master George A. Romero was originally set to direct a movie based on the franchise, after creating two successful live action commercials for the video game 'Resident Evil 2', that were aired only in Japan (YouTube them, they starred Brad Renfro). He sat and took notes, whilst his secretary played the original game next to him and handed the screenplay to Capcom and Sony. Though somewhat true to the original game, the script was shelved. George was fired and the movie was plunged into development hell.Eventually Paul was hired and wrote something respectably set within the first game only, but ended up creating all these new characters who are so underwhelming. Milla Jovovich is probably one of my favourite actresses and arguably she's probably the only thing good about these movies. But even she can't save this poorly executed franchise that managed to start off so wrong. Michelle Rodriguez is Michelle Rodriguez, and to say the rest of these characters are cardboard would be an insult to good packaging material.What would have been more appropriate would to have instead have zombies roam the house, and have the squad fall back into the underground labs due to having no chance of escaping. If there going to die anyway, at least you suddenly have a situation they have no control over and a sense of danger. That would be more compelling then letting them loose yourself. Better yet, just keep it simple and follow the PlayStation one classic that managed to make the franchise what it is today.Final Verdict: I wish Paul actually knew how to make a zombie film, let alone a good film. 5/10.",5,1,3,7 August 2014
District 9," Why So Much Hate In A World Of Prawns?
","If you watch cinema today, you know originality has been down the crapper, there's been an almost severe lack of great science fiction (Say '2001' or 'Blade Runner'). However, out of all the films to come out in 2009, I feel 'District 9' surpasses the likes of 'Avatar' or 'Transformers 2'. Proving that even when working on an incredibly low budget, CGI is maturing rapidly beyond 'expenses' and 'limitations'.The answer to a failed 'Halo' movie. A lot of people have already condemned this movie for having no originality, due to the fact that there are so many prior movies sharing similarities such as 'The Fugitive', 'The Fly', 'Alien Nation', 'Independence Day' etc. Even though this movie contains many elements of those certain films (Few I think fall flat), this still stands strong as something completely different from what we've seen in a long time. Managing to include a lot of heavy themes such as racism, poverty and corruption. As for the actual film WOW! America doesn't get invaded this time. No it actually lands in Africa, where the director and most of this cast originated.Aliens land not with gifts of wisdom or shiny utopias, but sickness, famine and are sent away to live in the slums outside the city of Johannesburg. 'District 9' becomes a breeding ground for gangs, shantytowns and clearly the beginning of something much worse. Among them a simple employee from the government anti-alien company 'MNU', will soon become the answer to either the company prayers or the aliens salvation.Sharlto Copley did a superb job as our main character. For a first time role I'm very pleased his career has got off to such a good start, as well as the supporting cast who do terrific jobs building a real sense of dirt, tension and prejudice that bring out the 'realism'. Again it's clearly Sci-Fi, but why do I feel I could switch on the news now and see a country pull itself apart as depicted in this movie?Final Verdict: Neil Blomkamp & Peter Jackson have made something truly special. I feel Blomkamp is trying to reproduce and show a little bit more than what regulations would usually allow, but by including aliens in the mix as a substitute it could very much threaten any underlying message they were going for. Either way 'District 9' was entertaining, and to me began a tradition that I feel we will have at least one exceptionally great Sci-Fi movie each year since. 8/10.",8,0,0,16 November 2013
Batman Begins," Well After Batman & Robin, We NEEDED This...
","Considering the last Batman outing had left such a sour taste in everyone's mouth, and pretty much nearly killed the movie franchise all together. Batman clearly needed a time out, however it was inevitable the character was obviously going to make a return someday. But who knew that only a few years later Director Christopher Nolan would not only bring the character back in such a dark, bold psychological way, but would also bring such depth and respect for what the character stood for in a Trilogy that has gone on to gross millions, win audiences and critics alike. Setting a new standard most comic book movies today are trying to emulate.Alas the film-makers finally did some research, and pulled parts from the classic 'Year One' title which modernised the origin. A few years ago, a younger me wished they followed these various books just a little more closer. Now that their story is full circle, any divergence from the source material matters not in their overall grand scheme of things.Christian Bale is wonderfully casted as Bruce Wayne, given this is from a guy who adores Adam West, Michael Keaton and still thinks the greatest interpretation belongs to Kevin Conroy. Bale is currently one of the finest actors of his generation, who has given much stronger & heavier performances and still has more than enough makes the role his own. Unfortunately, I also have to mention the obvious elephant in the room and that is 'that voice', which is overall ridiculous. I understand the necessity and primal reasons for it, but I'm sorry I cannot take it seriously. Saying that, we have the likes of screen legends Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine giving performances WAY beyond that of any regular supporting cast. Backed up by Dutch great Rutger Hauer, Katie Holmes and a personal favourite newcomer Cillian Murphy as the 'villain' Scarecrow (Who lets face it, gets shafted way too easily).Getting into what little I want to talk about the plot, 'Begins' paints a wonderful interpretation of Batman's mission. From innocent beginnings, tragedy, self-imposed exile, revelations and redemption. All are expertly crafted into a wonderfully earnest first act, that Christopher Nolan really makes his own without having to go too back & forth with signature traits i.e. 'Memento' (2000). And finally, Gotham City looked stunning. From dirty streets, amber glows, train rail screeches and overhead smoke fumes peering out & around every corner on a scale this big is utter fantastic (But a little disheartening that it all seemed to all disappear in the follow ups).Final Verdict: Now that we have the whole Trilogy, 'Batman Begins' starts everything right with wonderful character development, superb casting, large scale beginnings and above all, wonderful promises of things to come. No one knew a few years down the line just how sudden everything was going to change. 8/10.",8,0,1,28 December 2013
Saving Private Ryan," World War II Never Looked So Visceral.
","'Saving Private Ryan', is one of the most pivotal moments in both Steven Spielberg's career, and the War genre in motion picture history.It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks), and his squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg and Jeremy Davies) as they search for Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.Most notably to be said about the movie, is the depiction of the Omaha landings. Basically, it was a war re-enactment consisting of 1500 extras and 30 or so amputees. Spielberg did not plan ahead in terms of storyboarding, but instead decided to place the camera where it was best suited for spontaneous reactions. Admist all the amazing locations and bombed out villages, every soldier is relying on one solid emotion to get through the war, hope, which comes in the form of the missing Private Ryan. Unfortunately, that hope is tested as inevitable casualties will demoralise and divide the squadron.This film covers pretty much all aspects of war. The tension, nature and sadness of it all gets stripped bare, as all stones are turned and the end result is one of poetic beauty. However, I never really found myself caring whether they found Ryan or not. Though the ending can't help but feel forced, it's certainly touching and has a lot of patriotism in mind.Final Verdict: Definitely one of Spielberg's finest. I look forward to watching 'Band of Brothers' (2001), and seeing what this man can do with more running time. 9/10.",9,4,7,26 August 2014
Lawrence of Arabia," The Epic Super Panavision Desert Masterpiece.
","Though somewhat controversial in its depiction of certain events, once you sit through the first 30 minutes or so of David Lean's masterpiece you ask yourself 'How can I not love this movie'? From its outstanding 'matchstick' cut, Freddie Young's cinematography and Maurice Jarre's phenomenal score, 'Lawrence of Arabia' continues to be one of the most astounding practical effect movies ever made. Costing only $15 million dollars, to which Steven Spielberg claims that if made today shot for shot, it would be way over $250 million.Told in two parts, The film awkwardly begins by depicting the last moments of Lawrence's life and the attendees of his funeral who claim to have known his daring exploits. I don't feel like I've spoilt anything for you, because we are then immediately thrown into the beginning of the adventure. Following Lawrence on his travels with the Arabians on their revolt against the Turkish. An epic weave of unification, somewhat sadism and pleasant egotism amongst the characters has a scope way beyond that of a camera lens.There has been a somewhat controversy on how Lawrence has been portrayed in the film, but Peter O'Toole's performance is phenomenally impressive, and to me somewhat revolutionary considering certain acting sensibilities of 1960's Hollywood and World cinema (Then again, this was also the same year Gregory Peck astounded audiences with the Oscar winning performance in 'To Kill A Mocking Bird'). Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins and Omar Sharif do extraordinary work also (I wish Gertrude Bell had made an appearance somewhere). There's just too many great quotes uttered in this movie, and all the dialogue from ever actor is impeccable.Allow me to ramble on just a little bit longer, but the frontier is gorgeous. Whether it fades in from a previous scene, or emphasised by Maurice Jarre's score, it's one of the few films that makes me believe that when someone is dehydrated they really are. Lean's vision is vast through both its establishing shots and hundreds of extra's, reportedly he looked at John Ford's 'The Searchers' (1956) for ideas and even some have made narrative references to Orson Welles's 'Citizen Kane' (1941).Final Verdict: Regardless of what version you see, 'Lawrence of Arabia' is one of the great epics that truly deserve the title. In the years that will follow is it destined to remain as one of the tops? Let us just say that 'Nothing is written'. 10/10.",10,1,2,14 March 2015
Gone Girl," David Fincher Firing On All Cylinders.
","With a director like David Fincher, you can expect a few things. The man has a speciality for creating extremely effective thrillers, and he's also very good at adapting and being faithful to source material such as 2011's 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo'. 'Gone Girl' is a best-selling novel from 2012, written by Gillian Flynn (Who also wrote the screenplay, and stated that it deviates from the novel). I can confidently say it has been a long time since I've gone to the theatre and been captivated by an entire movie. Sure there has been some stellar pictures out this year, but to actually sit down and be absorbed into a 2 hour 30 minute film and want more from it by the end is very impressive (Considering a majority of the year's biggest movies appear during awards season).Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) seem to be the ideal couple. From humble beginnings to a whirlwind engagement, at face value no one could doubt how flawless a couple they seem. Eventually on the day of their fifth anniversary, Amy goes missing. Nick calls the police who do their duty, yet after studying the apparent home invasion remain suspicious. Her disappearance creates a media frenzy turned witch-hunt, and Nick's behaviour and surfacing lies surrounding the marriage are interpreted by the media and public as characteristics of a sociopath. Did Nick kill his wife? And just where is Amy?Two words easily sum up 'Gone Girl' for me, Riveting and Haunting. American suburbia is turned upside down, and the many clues left behind for Nick become more engrossing as he remains one-step ahead of the everyone. Nick and Amy are the kind of characters that will jettison an actor into a household name. Ben Affleck continues to do extremely solid work these past couple of years, and with that said this is easily Rosamund Pike's finest hour and if there's any justice she is easily going to win acclaim for her performance. It's good to see Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry leave comedy behind once in a while, because if this is the result then I was also wonderfully engrossed. Finally Kim Dickens, Missi Pyle and the screen debut of Carrie Coon complete this casting jigsaw puzzle. David Fincher always gets the most out of his cast (According to producer Ceán Chaffin, Fincher took on average as many as 50 takes for each scene), and everyone just feels natural.What is left to say is that the music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is fantastic, and Fincher's camera work is as sublime as ever. Shadows and light help blur how events unfold, many shots look good enough to go on a postcard and the way how your support and opinion of a character can change as the movie progresses baffles me how they pulled it off this well. Even though the finale may be a big turnoff for some people, it ends ambiguously enough to never set the future in stone and doesn't betray such an impressive atmosphere the film has continuously grown from the beginning.Final Verdict: I really liked it, and I don't how I could make that fact more clearer. Gillian Flynn does justice to her work, and the result is probably one of 2014's best thrillers AND could possibly be my favourite film of the year so far. It's always great to see a David Fincher movie be so familiar and so well crafted to the level we've come to expect from him. 10/10.",10,2,14,7 October 2014
Drive," A Contemporary 1980's Throwback That Is Awesome.
","Few mainstream movies manage to capture the 'Midnight Movie' experience anymore, let alone throw back to some idioms that were well established in the 1970's & 1980's. 'Drive' is a fantastic movie that stands well on it's own two feet. Without directly saying it there feels plenty of influence to take from it's imagery, most notably Steve McQueen's 'Bullitt' (1968), and Walter Hill's 'The Driver' (1978). The opening scenes set the style of the movie perfectly, accompanied by a fantastic font choice and possibly 2012's most stellar movie soundtrack (Props to former Red Hot Chili drummer, Cliff Martinez).Having read the original novel by James Sallis, I can confidently say it deviates from the original source material slightly without effecting it's overall premise. For the movie they incorporate some romantic interest subplot that never felt right to me, but lends itself to incorporate some stellar shots of both of them together. It's beautiful cinematography, but personally I never felt all too engaged by it (Except for the 'Elevator' scene).What is engaging however, is Ryan Gosling's performance as 'The Driver'. I love the fact that both the movie and book never use a name, as it all builds some kind of mythic aspect like Clint Eastwood's 'Man With No Name'. Carrey Mulligan is charming what little screen time she has, and the same goes for Christina Hendricks, Bryan Cranston and Ron Pearlman. All are heavy hitters that again do well with what they have, but without doubt Albert Brooks performance as Bernie Rose is both subtle and brilliant. How that man did not win an Oscar, let alone not get nominated is beyond me.If there's anything more to say about 'Drive', it's that I'm very glad it circulated many festivals before (I think) a limited film release. In this day and age where common audience members expect to have emotions and feelings fed to you through tedious dialogue, 'Drive' is all the more impressive for not having to directly address that when it clearly shows up on the screen. I would also normally hate that in a modern movie, but the execution in 'Drive' speaks volumes and makes it all more than bearable. Making me somewhat a little more optimistic should we see more of it.Final Verdict: Props to Nicolas Winding Refn for making a great movie. Definitely one of the best from 2011, and I very much recommend it. 9/10.",9,1,3,11 August 2014
X-Men: The Last Stand," In All Honesty, Something Really Bugged Me About This One.
","Brett Ratner takes over directing duties this time around. In all honesty I feel that this film isn't all too bad, but it can't help but seem like a horrible cash-in just so we can see portions of the 'Dark-Phoenix' saga come to the big screen. Being that the 'X-Men' film rights are owned by 20th Century Fox, what is probably one of the biggest moments in Marvel comics history ultimately gets sh*t-canned in it's big screen adaptation.In the wake of the last movie, that wonderful character development is gone as well as that smart dialogue driven story. The tense fear of mutants is escalating, and what we end up with is 'the Cure'. The Cure for genetic mutation has been discovered, and Magneto finally begins his master plan to (Shocker) eliminate mankind. This involves enlisting the help of similar idealists such as the 'Omega-clan', and 'The Juggernaut' (Possibly the worst casting idea there ever was, was putting English hard-nut Vinnie Jones as 'The Juggernaut').However, we are extremely fortunate to get Beast in this movie played by Kelsey Grammar, and is possibly the best casting decision in this film by far. Aside from that, the film just felt lazy for the whole 1 hour 40 minutes. The exposition is heavy as we watch some noticeable cast members die, and events unfold at a snail's pace. We get a pretty impressive, yet kinda dull 'Last Stand' fight scene, horrendous dialogue as well as un-driven and uninspiring characters that above all destroy everything that made Bryan Singer's movies so respectable. If that's all you wanted then I recommend it, but if your expecting a better well paced progression from 'X-Men 2', you may be disappointed.Final Verdict: Looking back 'The Last Stand' is on it's knees, but it's also far from being atrocious. 5/10.",5,0,1,3 September 2014
I Am Legend," After A Long Development Period And Some Atrocious CGI. 'I Am Legend' Barely Leaves An Impression.
","'I Am Legend', was the last film I saw in the theatre of 2007. It was actually pretty good on the first viewing, but the second time around I started to get very little sensations that told me it really wasn't all that great. Based on Richard Matheson's 1954 vampire classic of the same name. This film had been delayed since the 1980's, and had gone through a string of action stars while in production. Upon finally being released, how did it all fair out? Well Will Smith was extremely convincing in the role, you can sympathise with him in his state of constant isolation and there's enough scenes to show some real star power. I can appreciate that some scenes came off as genuine, but a lot more of them felt forced. It's also one of those few films that I don't think I can really attack the dialogue scenes or many of their scenarios as some felt lacking, yet it never really bothered me too much.What I will attack however is the CGI, which looked utter crap. It was so unbelievably bad and horrible, it pretty much destroyed the film for me. In a day and age of such great makeup effects, how those film-makers looked at those scenes and didn't choose to include some practicality is beyond me. I feel I could be a little forgiving, but a lot of people I know hate this movie because of that unwise decision.Final Verdict: It's far from accurate on the novel it's based on, I also reckon it isn't really necessary viewing. Will Smith puts on a good show and that's about all I can say from it. 6/10.",6,1,1,26 August 2014
School of Rock," Jack Black Is A Substitute Teacher I'd Like To Have.
","Pretty much entertaining for all ages, and how happy I was that years later I found out Richard Linklater directed it. Jack Black knows how to keep everyone high spirited, and the acting from the children turns out pretty well considering many are a bunch of unknowns.I suppose like many school comedies nowadays it has its flaws: 1. Half the children don't even know how to be children. I know there's an extremely high standard school policy, but half of these kids come off trying to play much older roles than they should. 2. The film really stretches itself out as far as possible, half of the sight-gags do & don't work. Finally, the adults in this movie are just class-A stupid. Like i said, it has its flaws but it all builds up to a finale that doesn't disappoint.Final Verdict: Decent enough for any Jack Black fan, decent enough for all ages then I guess. 6.5/10.",6,1,2,15 September 2014
Kick-Ass," In A Perfect World...
","Having myself, father & sister read the comic book, it was one of those rare instances where we all couldn't wait to go see a comic book movie. For what is probably one of comics most strongest indie projects to come along in some time, and the fact the principle storyline tends to sway in each different form of media. The 'Kick-Ass' story magically works so well enough on print, this comic just had to be made into a film.The casting choice was solid. Aaron Johnson has slowly built up a solid career, and actually delivers my favourite interpretation of Dave Lizewski. Whereas Nicholas Cage and Chloe Grace Moretz, deliver a truly macabre performance of serious vigilante's 'Big Daddy & Hit Girl'. Finally Christopher 'McLovin' Plasse is awkwardly charming and funny while Mark Strong makes for a superb crime mogul.Overall, it's a fantastic looking movie. Vibrant, colourful and extremely well choreographed (Without doubt you can see why the controversy is there). True if the movie wasn't so self aware I would have a lot more to say, but ultimately it really is a decent pop corn flick. If this kind of stuff started taking itself too seriously, I feel it would surely fail.Final Verdict: Have an open mind and try to see the funny side. In a time where the internet exists and we become more desensitised to violence in pretty much every form of media, 'Kick-Ass' has a welcome place among its ridiculous bigger budget counterparts. 7/10.",7,1,1,16 November 2013
Ghostbusters," Nice Going Ray...
","This really is one of the best things to have ever come out of the 1980's, let alone the magnum opus of all the comedy talent involved. Incidentally, 'Ghostbusters' did to ghosts what 'Jurassic Park' (1993) would do to dinosaurs just a few years later. The effects and designs of these spirits are fantastic, and transcended extraordinarily well when it came to the merchandise and that classic cartoon series.Three men (The nerd, dope & slacker) open up a ghost busting squad that while ridiculed, accidentally ends up as a thriving and legitimate business. This all leads to a fourth member (The inevitably cool black guy) and enlisting help against an ancient Demi-God of ultimate evil, taking a bizarre form in one of the funniest climax's in motion picture history.Really what isn't there to like about Ghostbusters? Re-visiting it did I realise just how genius the writing and dialogue is delivered, and while it'll continue to hold up way beyond that of just a catchy Ray Parker Jr. song. While there has been talks of a 'Ghostbuster 3', there is no doubt that the fans love and 'kind of' own this franchise. It's so universally loved by all, I would probably rate it as my 2nd favourite comedy of all time (1. goes to 'The Big Lebowski'). I can't tell you how thrilling it was to be on the motorway onetime and have the ECTO-1 roar pass you (Presumably coming back from a showroom event, but nevertheless lights and alarms all functioning).Final Verdict: They just don't make comedy films of this calibre nowadays, but it's very comforting to know everyone involved went on to star in other comedies that continued to spin this special kind of comedy gold. 10/10. A MUST SEE comedy giant!",10,5,7,19 June 2014
Gran Torino," Clint's Still Got It.
","Shamefully the first and only Clint Eastwood movie I have seen in a theatre, 'Gran Torino' is definitely a highlight in this mans legendary six decade career. Sure his influence to the Western and Police genre are timeless, but this performance pretty much cements how relevant Eastwood still is and how much he still has to offer the medium.And so again with another tough guy persona, Clint plays Walt Kowalski. If there was anyone who can play the 'There goes the neighbourhood' guy without overworking it, it's him. An angry Korean war veteran, whose only remaining happiness is his pristine Ford Gran Torino. His no bull attitude eventually makes him a hero to his working class Asian immigrant neighbours, and Walt inevitably comes to enjoy their company. A few undesirables leaves Walt to eventually take matters into his own hands, protecting the neighbourhood who have grown to love him in one of cinemas most recent touching endings.The casting is arguable considering it features a lot of first timers, yet Clint has managed to choose his actors to fit there roles naturally and none of it ever comes off faked. Success is also risky when your starring and directing the movie, yet Eastwood's camera work is unflinching in depicting a local suburbia falling apart. The man still has the acting chops to hold up a movie, especially in the solo and tense standoff scenes (78 at the time, I still wouldn't mess with him). Final Verdict: A somewhat charming and somewhat down to earth gritty street drama. 'Gran Torino' isn't trying to say anything given some of the racist undertones, but it's another solid effort from Eastwood definitely worth seeing. 8/10.",8,0,2,28 June 2014
The Hurt Locker," Jeremy Renner Shines In This Gripping War Movie.
","Little marketing was used in the U.K. I only ended up seeing 'The Hurt Locker' at the time of its release mid-August, because a friend paid for my ticket and eventually as we all know it went on to win huge at the Oscars.'The Hurt Locker', is based on accounts of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad in the War in Iraq for two weeks in 2004. I can't really say that the script will be what draws people towards the film, but rather the situations and the performances. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are a highly engrossing trio of soldiers, who in some way all have different goals. Some are chasing vague battle high's, whereas some just want the job done and to be on their way. Whether their time there has made a difference to the situation or not, it turns out some soldiers never fully leave the battlefield. The only thing left to say is that Kathryn Bigelow shoots from far and close, to day and night superbly. She rightfully deserves the Oscar for 1. A superb character study, 2. A tense thriller when it comes to those bomb disposal scenes.Final Verdict: 'The Hurt Locker' is a great film. Never holding back in showing some of the more dire situations in a modern War environment, and there's a unique and different tension to every bomb disarmed (Or not). 8/10.",8,0,2,2 October 2014
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," The Apocalypse In This Franchise Could Not Happen Sooner.
","In this chapter of the film series, it becomes painfully clear that the franchise isn't going to treat the audience like adults.Sure it has a lot of action scenes to 'up the ante', and they give the fans a little more what they want. But it all seems such a waste on what they should've been doing in such a large city. They have a chance to portray the epidemic in such a way, yet they resort to keeping it all contained in buildings. Rarely do you see any large hoards of zombies outside and where the makeup on villain 'Nemesis' was fantastic, the 'walking tank' is reduced to a former good guy. Pardon my language, but what a 'F@%* Y!$' to the fans and one of the series best villain.God bless Milla Jovovich for actually trying, and Sienna Guillory was not bad as Jill Valentine. She looks the part, but every time you see her she drops an F-bomb (I think I'm in love). What better way to cap off all this sadness by adding comic relief Mike Epps (Whose actually pretty funny), and wasting the effort of confident talents Oded Fehr, Thomas Kretschmann, Jared Harris and Iain Glen.To be completely honest, the best thing about this movie was the superb teaser trailer directed by Marcus Nispel (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRnp4UPI-Qk). It's one of my favourite marketing trailers ever, and I've made it a personal mission to show as many people as possible.Final Verdict: Just one great big missed opportunity. Has anyone ever watched a George A. Romero Film? 4/10.",4,0,2,7 August 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," The Outcasts Got It Right!
","'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a series of comics from Marvel that since its inception, have had a vast series of characters and featured the more obscure species and locations of their universe. When creating something so ambitious, that will pretty much carry Marvel forward all the way to their inevitable 'Phase 3' series of movies. A lot of film-makers could buckle under such pressure, especially when the movie does not feature such well known characters. James Gunn has done a fantastic job in taking these outcasts, and thrusting them into the light through sly comedic timing and taking these misfits who shouldn't work together, work together.Peter Quill (Chris Pine) is abducted as a child by aliens and 26 years later, he roams the universe as self proclaimed outlaw 'Star-Lord'. Upon plundering a mysterious orb, there are many people who want it for their own means be it profit or destruction. This attracts the attention of Gamora (Zoe Saldana), adoptive daughter of the mad titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) and both Groot (Vin Diesel) & Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), who want Quill's bounty. All of them end up in prison where they come across Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), and from then on all five of them escape and try to find out the secrets of the orb. Hopefully before the pursuing villains Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) & Nebula (Karen Gillan) seize control of it.It's wonderfully casted, and all out fun from beginning to end. My only complaint with the story is that Peter's origin with his mother is entirely different from the original source material, and it really isn't all that interesting or compelling when it's reincorporated later. Thankfully it doesn't hinder the story much, or underwhelm any of the solid acting, hilarious pop culture and great music choices that build up the movies soundtrack. The visual effects are fantastic, and the lack of mentioning Earth really helps build upon how far away they are from where all other Marvel movies are set. Bradley Cooper pretty much steals the show with his voice performance as Rocket, but my fan boy moment would have to be that they casted one of my favourite cowboy actors Josh Brolin as the voice of one of Marvel's greatest villains Thanos. The delivery was impeccable, and if the rumours are true that he will be the villain in 'Avengers 3' I very much look forward to see what they do.In conclusion, whereas most comic book movies have spent the last couple of years trying to be dark and gritty, I love how laid back this one is. Confidence shows, and the ride is all the more sweeter because of it. There are plenty of great cameos and Easter eggs to enjoy and by the end, I feel this is the best comic book team movie done yet (Stay through the credits).Final Verdict: I look forward to becoming more familiar with the series after this, as James Gunn has crafted a wonderful movie. Had he not have to work in the confines of the rating system, we probably would have got his zaniest and the best Marvel movie to date. But the results nevertheless are a fun and quirky adventure, that comic book movies need more of. 8/10.",8,1,4,8 August 2014
The Evil Dead," The Little Film That Could.
","Well here we are with 'The Evil Dead'. Sam Raimi, probably has one of the most charming stories of how he got into the industry. He and childhood friend Bruce Campbell, created a 30 minute short entitled 'Within The Woods', practically inspired by the works of H.P Lovecraft. This helped Raimi convince people to secure a larger budget for the next production thus 'The Evil Dead' was made, and thus the rest is history.Five college students vacation in a furbished cabin in the remote woods. After they find an audiotape reciting incantations that release a plethora of demons and spirits, each of the group suffer various forms of demonic possession. Who and will survive? Regardless it's gonna lead to ridiculous amounts of blood use.It pretty much proves that regardless of budget, certain ideas and executions can become timeless and more iconic than a lot of these Hollywood franchise remakes we see today. Funny enough Sam Raimi had really became an influence to me when I began to take interest in darker movies. I remember watching 'Spider-man' (2002) at the age of 10, and I was just blown away at the angles, camera tracking during the web swinging, and the abandoned building at the end was so eerie. How wonderful to know that all this was carried on from his earlier works. Shot for very long hours, and the cast were local friends and family who kept constantly dropping in and out of production. Bruce Campbell is one of the most underrated actors ever, yet I think he'll forever remain this kind of 'B-Movie' icon for all the right reasons. But as said earlier, this movie is insane. It was made on a shoe string budget, has so many unique special effect moments and the finale is an incredible testament to the art of stop-motion before CGI now wiped it's arse over everything.Final Verdict: Another landmark of the Horror genre. If you haven't had the time to see it yet, make some. 9/10.",9,4,6,8 September 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A Wonderful Homage To Hong Kong Cinema.
","'Kill Bill Volume: 1' is awesome in every sense of the word. It's 'Lady Snowblood' (1973), mixed with other famous exploitation movies such as 'They Call Her One Eye' (1973). All blended into Quentin Tarantino's talent of taking 1970's or 1980's cheese, and making something unique with his camera skills. The fact that he also continues to execute non chronological storytelling so well, whilst also using both the Quincy Jones's theme from TV series 'Ironside' (1967-1975) and Bernard Herrmann's 'Twisted Nerve' (1968), further solidifies my love for this picture.One thing that really frustrates me to no end, is that this film came under heavy fire from feminists. I understand what the commotion is to some degree, considering the picture is a dark, gritty rape and revenge movie. However, that's kind of what really invested us in The Bride's quest and somewhat fuels our desire to see her succeed, as throughout both volumes the character slowly became regarded as a Cinema icon through the early 2000's for her strengths and independence. Regardless, if it was a man chopping up hundreds of woman, I'm sure we'd hear complaints about that as well. I guess there's no way to win them all, and for those people it remains their loss as they miss out on some really good genre mash ups.For everything good I have to say I feel that some scenes intend to drag on, but then again that's personal preference. There's something for everyone who's a fan of Yakuza, Samurai, Blaxploitation, Spaghetti Westerns and hey, even Anime. In the end, I'm more than willing to watch through them all just to see how well done those action scenes are choreographed.The casting is also done extremely well. David Carradine (Most notably from the 1970's cult TV series 'Kung Fu') is Bill and it's super pleasant to see both Sony Chiba, whose renowned for his Martial Art talent and Chiaki Kuriyama again straight after the success of 'Battle Royale' (2000), Tarantino's favourite movie since he became a director in 1992. Some of Tarantino's regulars show up, yet hands down the performance from Uma Thurman is what keeps you watching. Recently I looked up a list of female action heroes, and no doubt Tarantino and her input have created a character that would be well within the likes of Sigourney Weaver in 'Alien' (1979), or Anne Parillaud in 'Nikita' (1990).Final Verdict: Tarintino's story of a woman's quest for vengeance is told and shot beautifully. It just gets better with every viewing. 9/10.",9,0,2,12 August 2014
From Dusk Till Dawn," Well.. The Name Of The Bar Made Me Chuckle.
","I truly adore this weird little piece of drive-through exploitation cinema. The first movie to mix the creative camera work of Robert Rodriguez, as well as the writing and 'acting' talent of Quentin Tarantino. 'From Dusk Till Dawn' begins serious in tone, then suddenly B-Movie madness shines all throughout the remaining half.Based on the notorious 'Grindhouse' movie boom of the 1970's, George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play two criminal brothers escaping from the law to Mexico. Along the way they kidnap a family trio (The father is the superb Harvey Keitel), and while waiting for the cartel they hide out in a sleazy strip joint appropriately named the 'Titty-Twister'. It's stupid and dumb, but that's what's so damn enjoyable about it. Robert & Quentin have literally created a fantastic 'leave your brain at the door' movie, and re-created that B-movie vibe with quite an ensemble cast (Most notably Tom Savini as hilarious biker 'Sex-Machine'). Overall it's a fun movie with guns, over the top gore and one liners that all echo Rodriguez's 'El Mariachi' movies. And when mashed together with Quentin's quick witted dialogue and humour, what more could you ask for? Final Verdict: If you liked Tarantino/Rodriguez's recent 'Grindhouse' Double-Feature, then you should love this. I've seen it so many times now and damn is it re-watchable. 8/10.",8,1,2,16 November 2013
Clash of the Titans," A CGI Fest That Feels Woefully Unnecessary.
","'Gods created the mortals, whose faith and prayers assured their immortality. As time passed however, mortals began to question them and soon resist their creators, angering them greatly'.I haven't got too much to say about the new 'Clash of the Titans', but casting Sam Worthington as Perseus was a somewhat decent choice. Mads Mikkelsen remains as phenomenal as he always is, but Gemma Arteton never really convinces me as actress. Finally, Liam Neeson & Ralph Fiennes are great whining and moaning to each other as Zeus & Hades.One thing they seemed to have carried forward from the original is the lacking of a decent script, and sadly no Bubo. The set up was pretty much up to standard with the original, however I really didn't think 3D was needed and the ending like most of these kind of movies was horrendously rushed. But sitting there in the theatre and at 18 years of age at the time watching this, I fell back into my childhood memories of seeing many of Ray Harryhausen's work like 'Jason & the Argonauts' (1963) coming to life before my eyes. I still think they will continue to remain timeless, and unfortunately this movie will not.Final Verdict: Not bad, but unnecessary remains the word that best describes this film. 5/10.",5,0,0,4 September 2014
Jurassic World," The Best Sequel Since The First Movie, But Boy Does It Punish You The More You Think About It.
","What is there to say about 'Jurassic World'? Did we really need it? And will it stand out from any of the other noticeable summer blockbusters of 2015? Well I'll get this out in the open first and foremost, I didn't really plan on seeing it. Let's just say 'The Lost World' (1997) and 'Jurassic Park 3' (2001), didn't really leave the franchise on a high note 14 years ago. I could only hope that this one would prove to be popular enough to make its obvious large amounts of money, and somewhat shake up the narrative of 'Dinosaurs escaping captivity'.Though the dates are never referenced throughout the movie, there is a line that really bugged me when the park's operations manager says something to the effect of 'People have lost interest in Dinosaurs', to which I could only react with a highly raised eyebrow and a chuckle. My thoughts after leaving the theatre that night, was that the original 'Jurassic Park' (1993) continues to hold up extremely well (Even in the effects department thanks to Stan Winston), and I was surprised at how much I did enjoy 'World' even with its many, many flaws (The movie just had the highest grossing opening weekend of all time with over half a billion dollars, Bravo!).So in what is possibly one of the worst cut and paste scripts ever made, two brothers are sent to the fictional Isla Nublar to enjoy 'Jurassic World', a Dinosaur theme park built upon the disastrous grounds of the first movie (A rather clever reference is made). They are there to visit their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), the park's operations manager who is obviously far too busy to see them and must prioritise on the large, new and exciting 'Frankensaurus' they have created as (Here we go again) 'People have lost interest in Dinosaurs'. The inevitable happens, the electric stays on unlike the original movie and somehow the situation is made worse when there really should be some failsafe protocol given the tech this movie has. Aid is needed by the likes of Owen (Chris Pratt), who has somehow managed to command some form of alpha-male bond with the Dino's. Throw in a ruthless, corrupt head of security (Vincent D'Onofrio), too many clichés that throw back to the first movie (Which was sad when I thought the movie was actually doing well as its own thing), and some of the most blatant brand advertising I've ever seen. Ladies and Gentleman, welcome back to the park where brand loyalty IS priority.I don't really think there is anything here that will allow this movie to age as gracefully as its origins, and not one character is well developed enough to the point where their performance stood out. There were moments where so many subplots were left unanswered, and the dialogue wasn't particularly rich with sentences that gave a deeper thought of 'Man playing with nature' (Though let's be honest, none of the movies really have). A hilarious moment I had to myself was when comments are made about using Raptors in War (An image of one came up suited and booted for combat on screen), to which I thought of the 'Helicopter scene' from 'Apocalypse now (1979). Instead of Wagner's 'Ride of the Valkyries', send a bunch of Dino's into Warzones with John Williams's 'Jurassic Park' score ('Jurassic War', that'll be the day).But in all honesty, there were some moments that did win me over. I like that most of the casting decisions were spot on, and though I was expecting some terrible CGI we actually got some really good moments and set pieces that helped made me appreciate the efforts the filmmakers went to. The film wastes no time getting into the heart of what made the series so appealing to begin with, and I also thought a certain aquatic dinosaur should've really been the 'big top' of the show. When all is said and done, I came out of it satisfied when I was almost certain I was going to downright hate it.Final Verdict: Dumb fun. I've given my two cents, and I hope you enjoyed them. The movies a huge financial success, and there was plenty enough that would make me look forward to a next instalment as much as consistently dread it. Obviously I feel I have referenced the previous movies far too much, and for that I apologise. But in the end, Dinosaurs are popular again. Touché movie, touché. 6/10.",6,2,8,25 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Marvel Really Knows How To 'Up The Ante'.
","Three years later and the team returns. Come to see this movie completely up to date with the story, because 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' barely gives you time to breath among its many spectacular action sequences that start even before the opening credits. Die hard fans will love that all the main characters and supporting heroes make an appearance, and by the end you'll definitely be excited for what is to come before the 2 part finale in 2018 & 2019.An unspecified time has passed since the events of the first movie, and the Avengers have learnt to somewhat bounce off each other and utilise the best of each others powers significantly. Among various missions across the globe, they storm across compounds with enough various technologies from previous movies that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) can finally work upon the 'Ultron' initiative. Like any comic book narrative, things are jumped into too hastily and suddenly plans to attempt world peace and security could ultimately lead to its extinction.Those familiar with the comic books know that 'Ant-Man', famously created 'Ultron' (A character who is about to receive his own anticipated film release in a couple months). However the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been doing its own setup for a while now, and they've flawlessly worked their choices into a movie that definitely does justice to the destructive capabilities 'Ultron' is known to be capable of. Joss Whedon returns from directing the first movie and I really enjoyed the speed and pauses they've incorporated into this lengthy movie, considering that while I still enjoyed the first movie I also felt like I was watching an episode of 'Firefly' in terms of patient waiting (FYI, 'Firefly' is a truly great show). Some of the action is a little obstructed from being so up close, but the particular sequences and outcomes will guarantee to leave you enthralled.'Age of Ultron' has its slow and tender moments also. Nothing that falls into overall cheese, but some stuff incorporated feels a little underdeveloped or unnecessary (The 'flashback' sequences were a nice touch). Ultron is voiced and motion captured very well by the always charming James Spader, whose villainy is somewhat established right from the very start and I found that a little jarring. The only two downsides I saw (As a fan) is that I wish they had somewhat introduced a naive mind that eventually turns evil (A later introduction of a certain fan-favourite android was handled this way perfectly), and that they incorporated the design of Ultron from the comics onto the main 'body'. Alas we have the somewhat face we've seen similar to the 'Transformer' movies, but his minions have the comic book look so I was happy nonetheless to see it somewhat done. Regardless, James Spader did wonders for the part, and brought a real presence to one of Marvel's most memorable foes.Final Verdict: It was loud and extremely fast, and surprisingly that wasn't really a bad thing this time around. Every actor and character new and old delivers greatly, and the footage from the trailers of the last previous months lived up to the hype and more. The 3-D felt a little unnecessary for the many dark sequences of the film, and I don't think you'd be missing anything regardless. But all in all, 'The Avengers' are most definitely back for a superior follow up. It's gonna gross unfathomable amounts of money, and by the time the credits roll I was more than happy with the intelligent directions taken and the foreseeable future of the series as always looks promising. 7/10.",7,4,12,26 April 2015
The Dark Knight," Batman Gets Serious.
","After a well executed origin story with 'Batman Begins' (2005), 'The Dark Knight' obviously had to raise the bar and bring a take on the Joker, that could stand against the larger than life portrayal from Jack Nicholson in 'Batman' (1989). Well I was 16, and in my final year at secondary school at the time of this movies release. I bring this up as while in my ICT lesson, I heard the sad news of Heath Ledger's passing from my classmates. This was still at a time whereas I wouldn't really watch any pre-release trailers, or read articles on the production etc. But nevertheless, I very much wanted to say that I've always enjoyed his performances and after seeing him in this movie, IT really is sad such a talent has passed away in the prime of his life.To get back on to the movie, I was still not entirely aware of Batman's 75 years of history at the time. This movie WAS the summer film of 2008, and got large mainstream attention in a sense that everyone I knew was talking, dressing and acting like the Joker etc. It was a great rush to see something like comic books, suddenly being brought so large into the mainstream around my age. Merchandise and marketing were flying everywhere, and seeing Batman so heavily invested in what was essentially an organised crime story was a very unique scenario. Christopher Nolan manages to bring something new for comic book movie standards, that could actually work without the leads even wearing costumes.To say what I really enjoyed about this movie off the top of my mind, there are no flashback scenes whatsoever. The future 'The Dark Knight Rises' (2012) had a few, but there are so many subplots well executed in this chapter it doesn't need any back and forth. Everything is so 'in the moment', it feels like well executed progression that I genuinely get chills thinking back to that interrogation scene. Again the casting is sublime, and every performer carries their own weight without having to exist for the sake of existing, or relying as a wingman to a more important character. The Joker IS the movie. Not only did anarchy get to stretch above and beyond in this flick, but the many images from burning dollar bills, to pencil magic tricks all kept me captivated as soon as it started on screen. The few small problems I have are really just nit picks. Gotham doesn't look as good as it did in 'Begins', and I wish Batman & Joker had a few more scenes together (Just to give us more of that fantastic back and fourth dynamic yin and yang confrontations). Secondly, the portrayal of the Joker is perfect for this movie, yet I hope the clown side will come out more next time as I fear the character may not be able to do so, after being portrayed so dead serious. I do not envy the actor who has to follow up this Oscar winner.Final Verdict: The best of 'The Dark Knight' Trilogy, that really goes beyond even that title. It's the pinnacle of a serious live action take on the franchise, that deserves to be seen and heralded for raising the bar. 9/10.",9,0,1,1 January 2014
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The Biggest Book In The Series, Becomes The Shortest Movie.
","'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix', is the biggest book in the series, yet the shortest film. Anyone who has read my review of the last instalments knows that I was impressed so much with the series, I finally decided to pick up the books.Reading what was going to be in the 5th instalment, I got very excited to what it was gonna look like in it's film counterpart. The Hospital, the strange rooms of the Ministry of Magic, various supporting cast returns and revelations etc. I could not wait. How frustrating it was to hear that we were going to have to wait for 2 years. But in all fairness, it's a large book and if the extra time is gonna give me more bang for my buck, so be it.How did they mess this up so bad? I know you can't have everything and it's very hard work the amount of effort that goes into these pictures. But there wasn't even an attempt to even mention large parts of the book. Even the huge, important total series-changing discussion between Harry and Dumbledore was so short and watered down, it might as well have just been left out altogether. The one thing that works is Imelda Staunton's insane performance of Dolores Umbridge, that evil b*tch in the book was executed so perfectly.Final Verdict: 'Order of the Phoenix' had really disappointed me. Though I was at first sceptical hearing David Yates would be directing the rest of the series, it's good to know that around the corner he would give the series a much better touch. 6/10.",5,1,1,29 August 2014
Into the Wild," Sean Penn Gives An Extraordinary Life A More Than Decent Tribute.
","'Into the Wild', is a dramatisation of the unbelievably true story that shows the life of 24 year old Christopher McCandless (Who is amazingly portrayed by Emile Hirsch). Rejecting conventional life, the movie chronicles his journey into the wild in which he would sadly not return. But in those 112 days out there, he probably lived more than any other person glued to his screen or struggling to pay bills ever would.Staying true to the non-fiction book by Jon Krakauer, and embellishing a little here and there. As he goes along his way he begins to learn more about life and meets a variety of interesting characters, built up by the movies impressive ensemble cast. Of course it's a reckless way to live, but the film wisely never judges. It really is an astounding work as true stories usually are. But just the fact that a person in his early 20's had survived that long with virtually no map or compass and just the open road, you can't help but be a little impressed.What really makes the movie for me is the acting talent, surprisingly everyone complements each other and never underwhelms. Not only is Sean Penn a good actor, but also a very good director. Many of the large establishing shots really make the movie surprisingly intimate given McCandless and his journey. Finally when you have Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam fame providing your soundtrack, it's pretty hard not to be enticed.Final Verdict: Definitely one of 2007's more impressive pictures. 9/10.",9,1,3,13 October 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," 'Hal & Dave, That's A Good One.' - Anyone Get This Reference?
","I'll destroy my credibility here and now by saying my dream job would be becoming a film-maker, the other would've been to become an astronaut. '2001: A Space Odyssey', surprisingly remains my favourite Science-Fiction movie of all time, and would definitely remain one of my top three favourite movies should I ever have to make a list. Steven Spielberg mentioned that Kubrick was very eager to somewhat 'change the form' of film. When Steven asked 'Didn't you already do that with 2001?', he said that Kubrick replied 'A little bit'. Stanley began making something that would change the face of the movie going experience, and represent a growth in the industry that only comes every few years if were lucky. Ambitions began by hoping to offer more than the genre previously did such as the large majority of campy fun 1950's 'Atomic' age of American Sci-Fi movies. Teaming up with Sci-Fi author Arthur C. Clarke, they began to write a screenplay adapted from Clarke's short story 'The Sentinel'. The result would be a project that was deliberately meant to be unique for everyone who saw it, and Clarke would somewhat continue '2001' with his version of the narrative in a series of four novels (Whether or not it was canon I do not know). '2001' has many themes present, but in its style and approach of the unknown I will also admit it doesn't really engage fully throughout its running length. Famous Soviet Director Andrei Tarkovsky criticised the film as too enamoured with spectacle, and would go on to create the phenomenal 'Solaris' in 1972 (Which offers far more in existentialism, and definitely worth your time if you enjoyed '2001'). It's obvious to say that nothing looked like this before in 1968. Star Trek season 2 was underway, the moon landing was still a year away and no one knew what our planet looked like from up there. The model space station orbiting around the painting of earth is burned into my brain, and perfectly transcends beyond the scope of any average Hollywood movie. The first 20 minutes alone is a silent masterpiece, at a time when the world and medium was growing so rapidly. Time is rewound to reveal something prehistoric, and suddenly the famous match cut shoots us thousands of years into space where it becomes obvious that the visuals are there just to accompany some incredibly large scale music pieces by the likes of Richard Strauss, and Johann Strauss II.To this day, 'The Monolith' is still shrouded in mystery. Does it grant knowledge, or just appear at pivotal events? Regardless, the mystery has endured the objects charm and legacy. Towards the second act, we see how far mankind has come with a certain Artificial Intelligence called the HAL 9000. In a harrowing display of humanity's reliance on computers, cold responses and interactions mean anything could happen when taking the 'Turing Test' of hell. With symmetrical rooms and unnerving silence, all of it eventually builds towards the trippy 'Jupiter and Beyond' sequence. Employing revolutionary slit scan photography that became an interesting marketing tool to the 1960's drug culture. Despised on release, but later praised by so many critics. This film can be analysed to death, but will probably never be fully understood. In a Playboy magazine interview Kubrick said LSD didn't inspire any of the films visuals, he has also been connected to this quote: 'How could we possibly appreciate the Mona Lisa if Leonardo had written at the bottom of the canvas: 'The lady is smiling because she is hiding a secret from her lover.' This would shackle the viewer to reality, and I don't want this to happen to 2001.' Themes of human evolution, technology, and extraterrestrial life are present. But more and more it becomes harder to pinpoint as we journey towards the unknown. Whatever '2001' is suppose to be it certainly feels like something mysterious and beautiful, much like the idea of space exploration itself. It's so obvious that the film to me is built to accompany classical music than storytelling, but does watching '2001: A Space Odyssey' prove respect can be brought to the genre even without definitive conclusions? Unfortunately I don't have those answers, and I feel most people may be turned off with the idea of having to make up their own interpretations even when such a conclusion opens up many possible outcomes (A scary idea, I know). Spielberg once defined it as 'Less Science-Fiction and more Science-Eventuality', if anything I always enjoy discussing with people how they felt about this movie more than most others. Kubrick is a master of his craft, and even ideas of space isn't beyond his camera lens.Final Verdict: To me, '2001: A Space Odyssey' remains powerful through sheer spectacle, beautiful music and stunning visuals set throughout the years and stars. Only Kubrick could have pulled this off so well. 10/10.",10,2,4,16 November 2013
Toy Story," The Largest Part Of My Childhood Put On Screen.
","With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. 'Toy Story' was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises & confidence.How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history.I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling & technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals & entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, and almost immediately think 'Toy Story'. As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then.Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, 'Toy Story' is that proof. 10/10.",10,5,5,15 December 2013
Once Upon a Time in America," An 'Epic', In Every Sense Of The Word.
","Epic, violence, greed and love. Many themes that are present and explored in Sergio Leone's final epic 'Once Upon A Time In America'. I suppose I must explain the injustice of what happened to Leone's work. Ten years in the making, the film was originally suppose to be 4 hours and 30 minutes long. Due to creative differences and distributions, the European cut was 3 hours and 40 minutes. The American cut however, was a mere 2 hours long. The narrative was beyond broken and everything made no sense leaving Leone reportedly heartbroken, vowing never to make another film and would sadly pass away a few years later. Luckily for us, it's been reported someday that Leone's children and the movies composer Ennio Morricone, will collect all four and a half hours and have a definitive cut soon underway. Onto the review.In essence, I find the story one I think all of us know somewhere deep in the back of our brain (which gives a weight to the proposed 'Opium' dream theory). Kids growing up as best of friends get themselves involved in organised crime, and now all is left is to wait for the inevitable crash. It would be incredibly rude of me to sum up the movie as just that, because for those people who have watched the film know that the performances and friendship between Robert De Niro and James Woods's character is remarkable. The visual look of the ghetto's are grand, rustic and BIG on scale. The camera is shot so well you'd swear you were looking from the eyes of the children.As well as looking extremely authentic, we are told a very well plotted narrative that spans into each friends 60+ years of living. We begin with an old David 'Noodles' Aaronson (Robert De Niro), smoking in a Chinese opium den as he reflects on his lifetime as a child and a young adult. So far we have seen that he is on the run in the present time, then almost immediately we jump to Noodles's early years making what he can of the depression and meeting a young Max (James Woods). As we meet the gang at a young age (Fantastic performances from these child actors), good times and tragedy are always frequent. Years later, Noodles and Max eventually meet again and my how times have changed.Again, what I've just wrote in the last couple of paragraphs, doesn't even begin to go deep enough to explain what happens in the first act. I really do not wish to tell you what happens, because there is virtually no way to explain the grand scope of this film. It hardly feels like a movie but more of an experience, one of which would feel criminal if I told you anymore about it. But as I will constantly say, the casting and acting is fantastic. The camera work by Leone as always is flawless, and the score for this movie is so big on scale I swear it could rival Nino Rota's score for 'The Godfather' (1972). Final Verdict: The greatest gangster movie ever made. When people talk about Leone's work such as 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly' (1966), they always refer to how strong the characters are. Please believe me when I say that these characters are some of the most strongest archetypes I have ever seen, and this film is Sergio Leone's Masterpiece. In the words of Roger Ebert, 'An epic poem of violence and greed'. Need we say more? 10/10.",10,3,8,5 September 2014
Alice in Wonderland," I Could Watch It Again, But It Ain't No Wonderland.
","Alice in Wonderland is an extremely beloved book by Lewis Carroll, that was adapted into a Disney animated classic. But how does the re-imagining fare out? Well the story I feel wasn't half bad, and I feel judging this film too deeply will be a headache because it is suppose to be filled with many bizarre characters and unexplainable moments. For the most part the lunacy is highly enjoyable, but as far as the situation goes which is being presented as serious in subject matter is nothing that special. In a nutshell, it's good vs. evil and a tad boring at that. There are parts where Mia Wasikowska shines as Alice, but there are more moments where the character is undeniably dull. I have always enjoyed Miss Wasikowska's performances, and had she more polished moments in the film I believe the performance would have been solid.Speaking of characters, Johnny Depp again delivers with his eccentric portrayal of the Mad Hatter. Helena Bonham Carter is also very well developed as the Red Queen, and my top 3 favourite characters would have to be The Hatter, The Caterpillar and The Cheshire Cat (Voiced by the always fantastic Stephen Fry).Well for as much bashing as this movie has taken, the visuals were incredible. It's becoming harder to say if technology is keeping up with Burton, but I loved every speck of smoke whiffling on the screen. Creating a live action version of Wonderland I feel could give 'Avatar' (2009) a run for it's money. If I had any complaints it's that the story could have been better, and if they had emphasised the correct characters the movie would be a lot more enjoyable. The fact that Christopher Lee was not more involved in the project is a little disappointing, given how his character is discussed throughout the story. They literally cut off his characters tongue at that moment, so he would not be able to talk during the rest of the scene.Final Verdict: When all is said and done, a return to Wonderland was inevitable and having Tim Burton direct it was the correct way to go. The result is a smart decision that if it had been executed a little better, it would have found more success critically. Regardless, it has fantastic casting, and that alone would get me back in the chair to watch it again. 5/10. Hats off to the future!",5,0,0,25 July 2014
Avatar," Ignoring The Hype, I See You...
","Well the hype for this movie was unbelievable with headlines buzzing '12 years in the making', and '1000's of man hours go into just minutes of this movie' etc. It was without doubt a very well marketed movie, because I certainly got sucked in being that it was literally everywhere here in the U.K.Still, James Cameron's goal is admirable. Where critics commented he was doomed to fail by making 'Titanic' (1997), he managed to do very well albeit including a romantic subplot. 'Avatar' definitely succeeds in the effects department, as it is without question one of the most beautifully CGI rendered worlds I've ever seen. Taking the novelty of 3-D (Usually being a method where an object is coming towards you), the movie makes very good progression when using it to instead aid and give the tropical world more visual depth (Although 3-D IS still a gimmick that I think will never catch on while glasses are involved).A young paralysed soldier is drafted into the 'AVATAR' program, to take over the role of his recently deceased brother. His job is to infiltrate a tribe of natives on the planet 'Pandora', whose home is on top of a large mineral source where small quantities are worth millions. However, will the time he spends with the natives change and alter him? Or will he be doomed to stand aside to let the corporations harvest the jungle? The story I have to say is flawed and in some areas is of course similar to other famous movies, most notably 'Dance's with Wolves' (1990). But I still think 'Avatar' has enough to be entertaining. Obviously more similar remakes and reboots are getting put out every year, and already in the same year 'BATTLE OF TERRA' seemed to be ripping off Avatar and getting away with it pretty well. As far as casting goes, everyone does a solid job be it motion captured or not. Sam Worthington is growing on me here and there, and to see Sigourney Weaver on screen again certainly brought back a lot of 'ALIENS' (1986) nostalgia to me.Other than that, it certainly falls flat in some areas. I don't know how well to rate Cameron as I writer, but the script doesn't deliver anything particularly memorable throughout the two and a half hour flick. Of course somewhat being the first of its kind, there's always going to be a level of higher regard as a success or failure. The kid in me wanted it to win big at the Oscars that year, yet looking back 'The Hurt Locker' more than deserved BEST PICTURE.Final Verdict: As a technical achievement, 'Avatar' is grand and gorgeous but unfortunately can't help but be a movie full of exposition, that is just 'showing off' how far we've come only in terms of technology. All that said though, it is an enjoyable flick, albeit a very long one that makes you wonder how refined Cameron's planned sequels will be. 7/10. It's a lot of fun.",7,2,3,19 June 2014
Toy Story 2," 'Toy Story' Gets A Decent Sequel.
","'Toy Story 2' originally began as a planned, direct to home release sequel. I also remember it being one of the first highly pirated VHS tapes in the UK.It's great to see so many new characters and scenario's in this second outing, and as always they cast these things obscenely well. The toy barn and airport scenes are super impressive 'set' pieces, and hands down the highlight of the movie is when they cross the motorway like something straight out of a Buster Keaton picture.Unfortunately, I feel the movie has aged over the years. It's still hugely enjoyable, but I don't want to lie to myself and say it's as impressive as the first movie. Even now with the release of 'Toy Story 3' (2010) that movie had the exact same premise, but the execution was a little more refined.Final Verdict: After everything that's been said, it's still another gem from Pixar worth seeing. 7.5/10.",8,1,3,8 August 2014
Up," Pixar's 10th Feature Goes All Out And Delivers Everything.
","You'd be forgiven thinking Pixar jumped the shark with 'UP', mostly in terms of what it could teach us.Everything Pixar continues to do is extraordinary and wonderful as previous outings, but what I am bringing up for debate was the showing of the main characters inability to have children. Obviously the decisions towards the ending gives a character somewhat what they wanted, but my friend believes that showing that scene in the beginning was far too adult for a young audience. I merely saw it as part of the sequence it was illustrating. It was sad, quick and never really affected me UNTIL the end of said sequence. I suppose I just wish to know if someone else felt the same way as my friend did, and see if Pixar was in the right or wrong of bringing something so real that commonly affects couples into this extremely innocent and naive story. SAYING THAT, I applaud the creators for their maturity and handling of the subject matter.Pixar's 10th feature is nevertheless gorgeous. It's charming and definitely stands up there as one of their best, 'up' there with the original 'Toy Story'. Ed Asner as our lead Carl Fredricksen is possibly Disney's greatest character, and everyone else is suitably casted like every outing this company delivers.Final Verdict: From the wonderful square skyscraper city, to the realistic cliffs and jungles of South America (Which the artists actually travelled to). 'UP' is no doubt one of the most ambitious & emotional journeys a kids film could take you on. 10/10.",10,0,2,15 December 2013
The Fly," Look At Those Effects! Look How Real Jeff Goldblum Looks..
","Oh David Cronenberg, how I love thee. Starting off your impressive career with a series of impressive body horror epics, whilst seamlessly blending into your modern filmography of human violence. 'The Fly' represents your best of both worlds sir.Originally a 1960's classic, starring horror icon Vincent Price. This timeless story involves a man stumbling into his teleportation device, and swapping body parts with that of a fly caught inside the machine. Nobody except Cronenberg, thought of the ingeniously terrifying idea of 'FUSION'.The performances from Jeff Goldblum & Geena Davis are riveting as the doomed couple. From twisted ideas of birth, to flailing limbs and overall decomposition. The effects to this day continue to astound, all without CGI truly cements this movie as an essential 1980's classic.Final Verdict: Released in the wake of the AIDS scandal (Hey Oooohh!). 'The Fly', along with 'The Thing' (1982) and 'An American Werewolf in London' (1981) represents the best make-up effects that decade had to offer. And in most ways, even today. 8/10.",8,0,1,7 December 2013
Total Recall," Give These People Air!
","At this point in time, Paul Verhoeven was the guy responsible for special effect and gun bonanza's such as 'Robocop' (1987), & later 'Starship Troopers' (1997). He does extremely well putting together what is an equal balance of absurd, yet interesting storyline. Taking accomplished actors and making them overreact, or sticking smut in their face (The chick with the third breast is pretty memorable).Definitely one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best. He plays Douglas Quaid, a man in the year of 2084 who has dreams of going to Mars. Essentially he goes to buy the tickets at 'Rekall', where they offer fictional memory implants and during the transaction is offered a fantasy package of being a secret agent. However, whilst undergoing the procedure it seems Arnold's character has a past (Or does he?), that eventually leaves him on the run from a bunch of agents (Most notably the always awesome Michael Ironside).Loosely based on the Philip K. Dick story 'We Can Remember It for You Wholesale', and stuck in development hell for a long time. I would thoroughly recommend seeing this movie, and not for the fact it was one of the most expensive films at the time of it's release. It's the kind of role that suits Schwarzenegger and the creature effects, set designs and make up still look brilliant. Horrible one liners? Pardon my language, but £%$^ me there's to many gold ones to count.Final Verdict: What a way to kick off the 1990's. Check it out as it is brilliant, mindless fun and highly re-watchable. 8/10.",8,0,1,3 September 2014
Rocky," It Ain't Over Till It's Over...
","'Rocky', is the first movie of a franchise that many people love and adore. Hell, go online and look at the user reviews and see how many people feel about this movie (Or the multiple videos of people running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art). Though I have never been the biggest fan of the franchise, I am for the first time currently watching the movies with a friend who is. Even though I don't adore all these movies like a lot of other people do, I can clearly see why they are so highly regarded.Sylvester Stallone (Who also wrote the script) stars as Rocky Balboa, an underground boxer who consistently wins yet earns little prize money, residing in a rundown Philadelphia town. Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), decides to give one underdog a shot at the title choosing Rocky because of his nickname 'The Italian Stallion'. Rocky is grateful yet refuses the offer, but after a change of heart he later accepts. Training with Paulie (Burt Young), who allows Rocky to train by punching meat in the factory he works at and old boxing coach Mickey (A brilliant performance from Burgess Meredith), who also offers his fighting expertise to Rocky. In his downtime, Balboa also tries to form a relationship with Paulie's shy sister Adrian (Talia Shire). After a couple of training montages here and there, Rocky is ready and does it really matter if he will win? We have gotten to know and love the character so much, either way you'll be cheering his name.Stallone really had a heart for this film, and obviously has done a very good job on making Rocky such an icon over instalments. John G. Avildsen has shot the film very well to capture the Philadelphia street-life, and the boxing match at multiple angles (Though with any simulated sport, some of the hits don't make contact). Bill Conti's music has obviously passed into the stuff of legend, and one thing I love about the Rocky films is that every one of them has a different era and form of music in their soundtracks. Sure you can have 'Survivor' playing, but the first score remains superior and the very well orchestrated pieces give bleak yet optimistic views of inner city life (Listen to 'Philadelphia Morning', you'll understand what I mean).Final Verdict: There's brilliant acting and a bit of a predictable script, but nevertheless it's a film full of heart. Rocky is a great underdog story and who doesn't love the underdog? 9/10.",9,0,0,16 November 2013
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Does The Magic Really Begin Here?
","Seeing as how we have reached the end of this franchise after 10 very enjoyable years, I think it's time to reflect on how well the series will stand the test of time. Upon hearing that they where making a movie adaptation of 'Harry Potter', I was not really affected. I was 9 years old and unfamiliar with the story. My father had read the books to me here and there, and only after I saw the 4th movie did I really get into this franchise and decided to pick up the books myself.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage, is set to begin his first year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As he makes close friends and a few enemies, Harry stumbles on a conspiracy and faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents when he was just one year old.This film is literally a perfect adaptation of the first book, that kind of works and kind of doesn't. With no disrespect to J.K Rowling, who is a fantastic writer, but the adaptation and direction by Chris Columbus is boring. So visually unexciting, you'd be surprised to hear that Terry Gilliam ('Time Bandits', 1981, 'Brazil', 1985,) was asked to direct. Seeing Terry's warped, surrealist imagery from his movies really would have been interesting to see how he would have depicted it, however he decided to pass due to studio control. Aside from that, this film is family entertainment at best. I remember watching it as a kid and loving it even more so than 'Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring' (2001). Now I'm much older, I can clearly say that LOTR was definitely better in so many ways. When I see this movie on TV nowadays it hasn't particularly aged well. It's fun in some areas and whimsical, but it's just not really that interesting.Casting (Mostly for the adults) is great, I'm proud to be British and there's a gigantic amount of stellar choices involved. Alan Rickman as Professor Snape could not have been a better decision, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, John Hurt and Richard Harris's short lived time as Albus Dumbledore all make for a fun time to be had. With that said, what wonderful talent that has been found in Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson. Though I didn't really enjoy them in the first half of the movie, once they fully interact with each other as friends did the film series officially begin.Final Verdict: For the first story in what would be 7 wonderful reads and 8 enjoyable movies it does well as a first outing, but everything in the later movies is just better polished and rendered. 6/10.",6,1,2,29 August 2014
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Dark Beginnings.
","SPOILERS! for the movie ahead. Read at your own risk.Now this where the film series really took hold of me. So much so, I finally began to start reading the books ahead of the movies release dates.Starting off really dark and creepy, we are then whisked off to the vibrant Quidditch world cup. Suddenly 'Death Eaters' (Voldemort's followers) strike, proving that no where is safe in the wizarding world. Essentially 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire', is a dark/high school/sports movie. The Tri-Wizard tournament is upon Hogwarts, meaning that foreign students are also joining the school this year, along with the tradition of the Yule Ball.Everything looks stunning, every competition takes a phobia and makes it so tense it challenges all the contenders senses. For Harry especially, not only does he have to deal with premonitions but also life and death (Against the Dragon), compassion and selflessness (In the Waters) and right and wrong (In the Maze). Finally culminating with the resurrection of Voldemort. I walked into the movie without having any prior knowledge how events would turn out, I was surprised to finally see everything not tidy and happily wrapped up. For the first time ever, the future of Harry's life looked incredibly uncertain.Cedirc Diggory is added to the mix and to be honest, I really enjoyed Robert Pattison's performance. Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody was absurdly fun and let's face it, Ralph Fiennes plays a chilling Voldemort.Final Verdict: 'Everything is about to change'. The films original tag-line lives to its statement and so much more. 8.5/10. Well done Mike Newell.",8,0,1,29 August 2014
The Matrix Reloaded," Decent For Its Time.
","It has it's ups and it has it's downs, but it's still pretty damn good. True enough there is a lot more of a heavy focus on exploiting CGI rather than acting. Whenever I think of the 2 follow ups to the original 'Matrix' (1999), the colour green becomes prompt in my brain. If memory serves me correctly I cannot think of a time when 'Reloaded' doesn't look 80% green.This time around Neo (Keanu Reeves) is still bland and is like us, trying to make sense of all this 'reality' in front of us. Through whatever hazy scenarios the plot seems to take us on, they all lead to some pretty fantastic set pieces and superb choreography. Some new characters arrive and definitely became fan favourites, even though they didn't do too much at all. The final 20 minutes of this film we obviously know leads into 'The Matrix Revolutions' (2003), but even so felt abruptly silly that I found this as the turning point where the series began to implode on itself.Regardless there is plenty to enjoy about 'Reloaded'. With a much larger budget, they planned to go all out and it definitely shows. The scenarios are more impressive and the acting in some areas get some much needed tweaking, but it is far from being the 'story' driven ride the first movie was. Where they mixed story and effects together well enough, the later sequels put effects over everything else with arguably disastrous results.Final Verdict: After everything I've said, this movie doesn't really offer anything new to the franchise. But what style! 6/10.",6,1,3,12 September 2014
Zombieland," 'I Don't Know... Garfield maybe?'.
","In terms of zombie comedy, and the fact that just a few years ago we had 'Shaun of the Dead' (2004). 'Zombieland' proves that there are still plenty of jokes to be made when tackling the undead, especially when it's this self-aware.'Zombieland' has great gore effects, interesting set locations, fun action sequences, 'that' cameo appearance and some overall brilliant 'laws' to follow in order to survive. Every character is uniquely different from one another. Most notably Woody Harrelson steals the show, but each of their own personal histories unravel towards the films conclusion which result in sadness, comedy and social awkwardness. In a world with only zombies left, how does that remains possible? Final Verdict: A great first outing for Ruben Fleischer. 'Zombieland' benefits because recently we are so use to seeing people flee in terror, it's rarely been done in Horror Cinema where those left alive just decide to let loose and have fun. 7.5/10.",7,2,4,17 August 2014
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A Much More Stronger Outing.
","Now this is where things get interesting as the series begins it's darker, more interesting traits. Certain elements would follow on as childhood would end, new characters, new creatures and overall some very impressive stuff was being developed. This is what Chris Columbus should have done with the first movie, darken Hogwarts's candle lit rooms, gain more from it's rich characters and enchanted objects. Finally, Hogwarts begins to feel more down to earth, rather than a child-friendly utopia.'The Chamber of Secrets have been opened, Enemies of the heir beware!', written in blood as students and teachers flood the corridor. Harry and his friends must discover the mystery, before everybody is doomed to the mysterious fate.Introducing Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), and Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) to the movie. Isaacs is brilliant and arrogant as hell, whereas Branagh is incredibly slimy (Ron's expressions pretty much sum up how the audience should feel towards the character). But aside from that, everything still has its flaws, yet it remains more engaging that the last in both style and substance. Harry and all his friends are given more screen time, and the paranoia between everybody feels like something the series would later greatly benefit from.Final Verdict: Better than the first one in almost every way. But now we lay these chapters to rest, and venture to maturity and the darker tones to which the series is best known for. 7/10.",7,0,1,29 August 2014
The Departed," Martin Scorsese Does An American Remake Right
","After seeing this back when it was released and being blown away, it literally got me wanting to check out the original Honk Kong thriller 'Infernal Affairs' (2002). Andy Lau & Tony Leung are fantastic performers, and the movie definitely helped bring a sense of originality at the time. Only someone like Martin Scorsese could surpass the original source material (And only just).The original is a fantastic concept and Scorsese's efforts make it one of his finest, finally winning an Oscar for directing that was long overdue. An Irish mobster plants a mole in the Police State, whilst the Police also plant an undercover agent to infiltrate. When both sides realise the situation, both men try to discover the others identity before there cover is blown.Hands down another amazing performance from Jack Nicholson, who is as always perfectly casted and steals the show. I also give credit to the chemistry between both Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt's performance is incredible and this is the kind of movie that Leo excels at. Thumbs up to Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Vera Farmiga and a great supporting cast of too many to count.Final Verdict: Definitely one of the few remakes worth checking out. 9/10.",9,0,4,14 August 2014
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Autobots MEGA U-Turn NOW!!!
","Michael Bay surprised us all finally with a somewhat, well executed live action adaptation of the 'Transformers'. Clearly it was the beginning of a million dollar franchise, that after viewing this piece of crap would only be renowned for stereotypes and horrendous dialogue (But still very impressive CGI).Reviewing this in three acts. SOMEHOW that giant city battle at the end of the first movie, that was witnessed by thousands SOMEHOW has been covered up by the government (How?).Act 1: Cue horrendous romance between teenage-angst poster child Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), and walking boobs Mikaela Barnes (Megan Fox). His ridiculous comic relief parents take him to college, where the mum gets high (Y'know for kids) and bids him farewell. Act 2: Optimus Prime continues to recruit more Autobots to his cause (Even racially sensitive twins apparently), whilst destroying the scouting Decepticons who eventually gain the upper hand through the mysterious 'Fallen'. This leads Sam to again help fight this intergalactic war. Act 3: No doubt a visually stunning finale of a battle sequence, WHERE THIS APPARENT ULTIMATE EVIL IS DEFEATED WITHIN 1 MINUTE BEHIND A BRICK WALL! All wrapped up in seconds, as if they had to cue credits three minutes after.Final Verdict: Even by blockbuster standards, what happened Michael Bay? There's insulting an audiences intelligence, but by delivering something so inferior you would have been better off giving us the trimmings of the cutting room floor. I apologies to fans of the franchise, but I cannot help but feel this will KILL the franchise for you as it certainly has for me. 3/10.",3,1,5,7 December 2013
Crazy Heart," Could Have Been A Lot Better.
","'Crazy Heart', is a very well acted movie. Jeff Bridges is as captivating as ever, and it's cool to finally see him play music on screen as he describes it as a very big passion to him. In a nutshell, a down and out of luck country singer begins to reassess his life. That's pretty much the one sentence plot of the movie, and it doesn't really go into any soul searching or particularly interesting areas that keeps the movie strong throughout its 1 hour 50 minute running time. The movie becomes somewhat extremely captivating while running those music portions, but dips considerably in their absence.The performances hold things together well enough. Maggie Gyllenhaal is charming on screen as always, however I am getting really tired of her playing these emotionally crippled or mentally ill characters all the time. Colin Farrell is also great, yet he appears for 10 minutes throughout the movie and I can't really say all that much about him.Overall the film is about redemption, trying to build back a life on a lifetime of drinking and sorrow. I kind of wish that the story was as interesting and as well done as the characters. But sadly your not going to find that here, it's just solid performances and all around decent country music.Final Verdict: Decent acting, decent strong music but a half baked story will stop 'Crazy Heart', appealing to everyone. But to those who will enjoy that are in for a good time. 7/10.",7,1,2,15 September 2014
There Will Be Blood," Daniel Day Lewis Is Nothing Short Of Phenomenal.
","Paul Thomas Anderson has a unique talent for making genre films distinctly his. After a five year absence he comes back with 'There Will Be Blood', loosely based on the 1927 novel 'Oil!', and it's nothing short of spectacular. It also noticeably contains a multiple award winning performance by Daniel Day Lewis, that I feel was the best character of that decade who embodied sin, corruption, greed and so much raw emotion it will remain forever unique. It is all so expertly captured by Anderson in a 2 hour 30 minute epic, and rarely any form of cliché or gimmick manage to sneak in.The setting mostly takes within place miles of desert, which pretty much suits Daniel Plainview's (Day Lewis) completely locked up character. From the beginning, we see him break his leg after a mine explosion exposes an ore, and drags himself what could easily be miles to the nearest town to record the claim. So begins a journey of one man forming a small drilling company, and blooming into a full blown empire. A few scenes of sparse locals and labourers bring us back to reality after watching some really brutal scenes, all of which culminates in a fantastic portrayal of one mans greed and utter destruction.Many critics had placed it at the top of their 'best of' lists, and to me there's an awfully big tie between this and the Coen Brothers 'There Will Be Blood' (2007). For me personally, it definitely places somewhere in the top 3 of 2007's movies. Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood composes the soundtrack, and distinctly makes it atmospheric with added drone sounds that get used a little too often, but never condemns the overall production. What little of the supporting cast is used, all of them hold up well. I have to admit however, that as much I love Paul Dano and no matter how good a performer he is, he doesn't hold up well as an 'antagonist' for Daniel Day Lewis (Who does?).Final Verdict: A superb drama like wine, it gets better with age. 9/10.",9,2,4,14 August 2014
Army of Darkness," No Horror, But A Decent Action Comedy Lies Somewhere Around Here.
","In many ways 'Army of Darkness' can appeal to just about anyone. I'd be lying if I said I wanted to see another cabin in the woods movie from this series, but I can't help but find myself wishing they incorporated just a little more horror into this one. Continuing from 'Evil Dead 2' (1987), Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) was sent back in time and now remains trapped in the Middle Ages. He must continue to battle the 'deadites', and find a way to return to the present.The character Ash is now fully developed. Equipped with his signature chainsaw and shotgun ('Boom-Stick'), are these tools and his priceless one liners going to be enough to fight off a legion of the undead? It should also be mentioned that later on Bruce Campbell perfects his performance, by playing Ash's evil demonic clone to hilariously new levels of comedy. In some ways the monster designs are also better with flying demons and graveyard scenarios that feel warm and familiar. Explosions are plenty, as well as a final epic battle to bring this trilogy to a close. This film somewhat succeeds with it's larger production, but feels like it should give more considering it's predecessors freedoms. If this wasn't rated 'R', I could only imagine what Sam Raimi mannerism's would make it into the picture.Final Verdict: Sam Raimi & Bruce Campbell perfect 'The Evil Dead' trilogy with a great send off. 7.5/10.",7,2,3,8 September 2014
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock's Unsolvable Mystery Is Figuring Out How To Stop Slow-Motion
","Robert and Jude have become a much welcomed pair, playing these two iconic characters in the acclaimed detective series written by Sir. Arthur Conan Doyle.As for Guy Ritchie's directing style, I only had one problem with it within the first 20 minutes where the fight choreography looked like it was going to all be intimate shaky cam. All was forgivable when the later fights were much clearer and though the use of slow-motion has became much more of a gimmick (Thanks Zack Snyder's '300'), the film thankfully doesn't use a lot of it. I was not really bothered with the violence critics initially brought up, and I imagined what with all the hell Shelock has put up with in past adventures it's no surprise his punching everything now.As far as the story goes it had me lost in some spaces throughout the film, until they eventually go through all the clues at the end. As I get older this type of narrative has lost a lot of magic to me unless it's done really well, and thankfully like the books 'Sherlock Holmes' offers a worthy premise that is engaging from start to finish.Final Verdict: Robert Downey Jr. is flawless as Holmes, plus Jude Law and Rachael McAdams are undeniably charming. Also the mystery of Mark Strong's villain kept me engaged throughout the entire film, and London looked very impressive. All in all, I think justice was done to a classic literary character. 8/10.",7,0,2,21 June 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman Soars (Literally...)
","It's one of those rare pleasures when you look forward to a film that was announced all the way back in December 2012, finally arrives and becomes your favourite movie of 2014. With a title like 'Birdman', what was I expecting? I remember hearing it was going to be a washed up actor trying to branch out after a lifetime of being known as a popular Hollywood movie superhero. To then hear that Michael Keaton was going to be our lead, it was now obvious that life was going to imitate art as Keaton has always been my favourite actor to play 'Batman'. A few trailers kept my interest peaked throughout the waiting time, and even after the movie was released October 2014, being in the U.K we still had to wait till January 2015. I've now seen the movie twice in one week, the first time was to admire how brilliantly paced the film was with the performances being fantastic archetypes, and secondly to see how all the dialogue reflects the coded visuals and psyche of the narrative.Riggan Thomas (Michael Keaton), was well known to movie theatre audiences for portraying a super hero called 'Birdman'. Now broke and forgotten, he prepares a comeback by reinventing himself as a director/actor by staging an adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story, 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love'. As the play continues to progress, the actors are not up to cut and the premiere date is ever-nearing. Riggan is having difficulties over his private life such as his rehabilitated daughter/assistant (Emma Stone), his talented yet demanding supporting actor (Edward Norton) and a slew of other problems await. Ultimately his sanity begins to unravel as life imitates art, the differences between art and commerce are false when satisfying an ego, and Riggan's apparent 'superpowers' and 'Birdman' conscience is the only way out of all this mess.Director Alejandro González Iñárritu went above and beyond with this movie. It's been purposefully designed to look like it was all one long take, and the pacing and energy works really well when you're working in the tight confines of a theatre. It's been supposedly announced that people told him not to do it, but the movie flows seamlessly because of this and the fact that Emmanuel Lubezki's highly imaginative Cinematography goes above and beyond (Lubezki was responsible for the long 15 minute takes of Alfonso Cauron's 'Gravity', for which he won an Oscar). The music is the first soundtrack work of Mexican drummer Antonio Sánchez, and it's entirely made up of Percussion instruments that when played on cue reflect both the upcoming events of the scenario, and Sánchez's drummer friend actually appears on screen during the moments of the main characters aggressively fractured mind.If you plan to see 'Birdman' just to see a superhero movie you're wasting your time. I enjoy Hollywood blockbusters as much as anyone else, but I knew from the beginning it was an affectionate and well done parody on what's trending at the moment. The film has a surprising amount to say about remaining relevant in the age of social media, and the characters efforts to refrain from any comments be it critic or audience sadly proves detrimental to his comeback. The film is Michael Keaton's first leading role in quite some time, and he nails it perfectly. I've always enjoyed him as a performer and wished he got to work a little more recently, but this is the role no other actor can play when regarding just how versatile he is given the wonderful ironic situation. Emma Stone was wonderful as always, Edward Norton got to parody himself, Naomi Watts does great and returns from the directors previous work '21 Grams' (2003), and finally Zach Galifianakis was great and kind of represented the only grounded reality in this crazy tale.Final Verdict: When all is said and done, the best way to explain 'Birdman, or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' is to see it again and again and get more out of it. It will polarise you and may seem a little lacklustre on surface, but there is a deep well of thought going on under it all and the technicality and craft was executed perfectly. It's destined to be one of those great films I've seen about making art like Federico Fellini's '8-1/2' (1963) and Charlie Kaufman's 'Synecdoche, New York' (2008), but all in all the wait was most definitely worth it. 10/10.",10,10,18,9 January 2015
Platoon," In The Jungle There Are No Fun And Games.
","I can't begin to imagine how one might feel after watching 'Platoon'. The first in a trilogy Oliver Stone made on Vietnam, the story was based upon his actual experiences as a U.S. infantryman in the actual War. Thus also making it the first Hollywood film to be written and directed by a veteran of the Vietnam War.Oliver Stone adds another classic to his extraordinary filmography, as well as delivering some truly great characters portrayed by some of the best actors possible. The main character is a decent performance from Charlie Sheen, but no match for how incredible Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe are as the ever confrontational Sergeants of the squad. I suppose the biggest thing that comes to my mind when viewing this movie is its music. The theme from 'Platoon' is so epic & sad, it manages to capture all the intensity and despair of the War. So much so that it makes this visceral experience so much larger than life, as well as haunting.Final Verdict: Truly incredible with perfect execution. 'Platoon' just feels like something too big to fit on a simple television screen. 9/10.",10,2,3,2 October 2014
Paths of Glory," An Anti-War Movie That Still Holds Up Considerably.
","In many ways Kubrick's 'Trench-Drama', is one of the greatest movies about World War 1 ever made. Life and times of those who fought on the battlefield are depicted radically for the time, fear and morale's are ever present and the lives of soldiers from multiple points of view are deemed crucial and worthless. Fantastic tracking shots move across the barbed wire and holes of a visceral 'No man's land', all the way to the courts and firing squads depicting Kubrick's use of one point perspective. Truly this film still packs a punch that really depicts how much a soldiers life meant back then, and in saying all this I want to point out that I'm not only addressing the French, everyone had a certain cause and reaction in the War which can be deemed 'inhumane'.After a voice over addresses the current situation of 1916, French Generals plan to send their men on a suicide mission to claim the 'Anthill'. Though there is doubts, promises of prestige quickly removes them and affirms the mission. The film stars Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax, A commanding officer who leads the mission aware of the odds against them. Though a valiant effort they must withdraw, Dax then attempts to defend a trio of soldiers against a charge of cowardice.In the aftermath of events, a lot of emotion between soldiers lead to moments of babble and solemn dignity. The somewhat conflict on the battlefield and court rooms are eerily similar, but there are also glimmers of hope to be had for the future. Kubrick's second of many War movies remains one of his greatest black and white classics, it is also the first well known account of Kubrick's infamous amount of re-takes that lead veteran actor Adolphe Menjou, to do the same scene 17 times with fury and anguish.Final Verdict: Unflinching in its portrayal. There is no hidden agenda in this movie, or at least one that is insultingly blatant that comes off shameless. It continues to be extremely re-watchable, as well as a well crafted movie that continues to hold up. 9/10.",9,0,2,14 March 2015
Carrie," She's With The Most Popular Boy In School...
","I don't know why, but that's one of many lines uttered in the original trailer that just lingers in my head. Cue the haunting lullaby jingle, and the best prom scenes ever committed to film in their hazy, unearthly quality. All have gone on to cement Carrie's legacy with utter charm, featuring superb performances from both Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie.Stephen King's first ever published novel. Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is a bullied girl, who lives with her very over bearing Christian mother. She has her first period embarrassingly in the girls locker room, and afterwards bizarrely begins to develop telekinesis. What begins as a simple regret and apology from one of her classmates, another girl has ridiculously cruel intentions that will affect prom night and everyone attending.A wonderful set-up, leads to a wonderfully crafted movie. Brian De Palma had brought to screen a wonderfully clean, so-so horror story with great success. In the wake of many other heavy hitters such as 'The Exorcist' (1973), 'The Omen' (1976) and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974) etc. Sissy gives us a teenager all too real, and saddens me that the genre has lost these strengths and character qualities in most horror movies nowadays.Final Verdict: A very re-watchable and timeless classic, that has gone on to influence pop culture and so much more. A definite must see. 9/10.",9,2,3,29 November 2013
Raging Bull," Originally Going To Be Scorsese's Last Picture, This Character Study Of An All Too Real Boxer Is Phenomenal.
","'Though I'm no Olivier, I would much rather... And though I'm no Olivier, If he fought Sugar Ray, He would say, That the thing ain't the ring, it's the play. So give me a... stage, Where this bull here can rage, And though I could fight, I'd much rather recite... that's entertainment.' One of the most famous soliloquies, and definitely one of the more memorable in Cinema. 'Raging Bull' is a sports film like no other. No rise to the challenge, no bull training montages just pure brutal honesty. Where would I even begin to review a movie so commended?Short answer, Robert De Niro's performance is stunning. A man so dedicated to his craft, he trained extensively under the managing of the real Jake LaMotta. LaMotta claimed De Niro could have gone pro, then Robert began a gruelling month eating fine French cuisine to gain the 60 pounds needed to portray Jake's later years. Regardless if he won the Oscar or not (Which he did), 'Raging Bull' will always stand as a testament to De Niro's passion as a performer. Finally, Cathy Moriarty as Jake's long suffering wife and Joe Pesci's mainstream debut are wonderful. The duo that is Pesci & De Niro are so good on screen line after line, insult over better insult. How can you go wrong when your own brother asks you to 'F**king lay me out'. Many themes are covered, brutal scenes of violence are depicted and even greater emotions come from some of cinema's most raw characters ever screened.All thanks to Martin Scorsese, who De Niro had managed to help him get off a cocaine addiction and pursue the project. His films are always pushing the very edge of movie ratings but regardless of what anyone says, to censor any artists work could possibly hinder almost every chance of the mediums growth. Scorsese's camera work and mannerisms continue to hold up even today, further solidifying my belief as the West's 2nd best director (Number 1 goes to Kubrick).Final Verdict: The best movie to ever be made about boxing that isn't a documentary. 10/10.",10,2,2,10 September 2014
X-Men: First Class," The 60's Keep Seeming More Vibrant Than Ever...
","Now this is where the 'X-Men' franchise, totally begins to redeem itself. After 'The Last Stand' (2006) and 'Wolverine: Origins' (2009) had disappointed me, I was so happy as well as confused to hear about the beginning of a new 'X-Men' trilogy. But then upon hearing it was going to be based on one of the more recent mini-series 'First Class', hype necessarily followed. When also considering the abundance of super-hero movies coming out this year, 'X-Men: First Class' was the only one I was really looking forward too.Though people seemed frustrated due to the fact that a majority of recognisable characters were missing from this story, I was really happy for this movies opportunity to feature all these virtually unknown characters who are brilliant and played by confident, unknown actors.The only minor problem I had was that it did not follow the 'First Class' comic storyline, but 10 minutes in I stopped caring because the 1960's aesthetic they went for is the equivalent of a James Bond movie. The friendships plus differences between James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as Xavier & Magneto are so engaging to watch, while Kevin Bacon was an astounding villain (Was it me or does January Jones scream 'Fembot'). Overall, the story worked well and the characters and themes the 'X-Men' were originally made for were very present. Fear of mutants (Originally a shot at Communism), and the ingenious idea of 'Mutant-Warfare' used during the Cuban Missile Crisis.Final Verdict: Though we still got to get through 'Green Lantern' and 'Captain America' this year, 'X-Men' is literally first class. 8/10.",8,1,2,16 November 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Man, Vigilante, Outcast, Legend....
","Here at the end, and honestly how could you not be. Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, have crafted the best comic book Trilogy so far and because of these movies, I have utter confidence that the character will go on strongly in the next iteration. But for now, kudos to Warner Bros. for allowing these filmmakers to approach the character so dark & boldly. The hype machine was inevitable, everyone who saw 'The Dark Knight' (2008) was blown away that a story could be driven like that in terms of dynamic between hero & villain.Here there are minor stupid flaws with the story and not to spoil anything, he hasn't been Batman for 8 years. Instantly he becomes Batman again, after using a brace that fixes a serious leg injury in seconds (Rendering the cane he has been supposedly using for quite some time useless). The other big problem I have is that Batman has to tackle nuclear weaponry, and things would and DO obviously escalate way beyond what would be his capabilities (Apparently they decided to homage the 1966 movie, by having Batman struggle to get rid of a bomb).Even though the plot is ludicrous. I adore that the movie seems to repeat all the motifs from the previous movies, that really builds towards a 'This Is It' kind of finale. A worse threat lies in the shadows of the background. However, Tom Hardy is our villain in the form of Bane (Who most notably broke Batman's back in the comics), delivering a solid performance as a terrible force of brains & brawn. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a wonderful actor, and even though they have big plans ahead for his character he ultimately feels woefully unnecessary, or at least the execution of his ridiculous origin story comes off sloppy. Finally Anne Hathaway's Catwoman is again another wonderful addition to the series, but I feel they could have downplayed her heavily and still received the same acclaim from her performance.But seriously, anyone who has seen it knows way to many subplots hinder a movie Batman himself isn't really in. I say this as the first time viewing it, I was awed with the last 45 minute all out war, that was obviously crafted to end things on a large scale. But on repeated viewings all the silly stuff like sending every law enforcer underground, seems ludicrous and in common sense would never really happen. I mention these problems not as a flaw that changes my critical opinion, but as a flaw that these series of movies that have became so well loved for keeping it an urban city crime drama, suddenly escalates into an all out nuclear war!Just writing that I laughed to myself.For the many problems I have with this movie, I'm so glad they chose to go with an all out operatic story. The supporting cast is wonderful, and all shine in their own various ways throughout. The final swan song preserves the ideologies of being the 'Batman', and promises that what he stands for will go on for a long time. To anyone who is a Batman fan in general, cannot deny how powerful that statement is to the character and his entire mythos.Final Verdict: Its a fun movie, in a series that blatantly peaked with 'The Dark Knight'. Satisfyingly concluding a journey we all began back in 2005. 7/10.",7,1,2,12 January 2014
Blade Runner," Tears... in... Rain. Time... to Die...
","Influence, upon influence, upon influence. That is what Ridley Scott has gave 'and will' give generations of future film-makers with his magnum opus, 'BLADE RUNNER'. Credited personally by Ridley himself as the best film he ever did, I don't even know where to begin writing a review on this. The man just finished the behemoth that is 'Alien' (1979), and proves he still had a lot more to offer the science fiction genre. Like Alejandero Jodorowsky before him, failure to get an adaptation of Frank Herbert's 'Dune' going, made him sign on to work on this masterpiece.If you haven't seen it, here's what your missing. Futuristic city visuals set in a dirty, smoke ridden Los Angeles, Androids i.e. 'Replicants' in the form of a young Daryl Hannah, and a career best from Rutger Hauer. Stellar action scenes evoking classic Film-Noir, and possibly my favourite of all Harrison Ford performances ('Raiders' is my favourite film & Han Solo is my favourite smuggler, but in this role he finally gives us a gruff detective persona that fits well within what he's capable of).The film itself gets very philosophical. The entire narrative derives heavily from the classic Phillip K. Dick novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep', which I've read and adored. But even doing so the film questions who is & isn't human, a class system of sorts, what is a human made of via. depth and mind and is our hero a replicant himself? Questions that come off less preachy and more profound towards the movies conclusion. Though I found it very complex first time around, future showings had lifted the smoke around the movie to reveal one of the best cinematic experiences around. But I cannot not mention that I saw the 'Directors Cut' first, then the 'Final Cut' (2007 - a gorgeous restoration). I have the big collectors box set, and must get round to the following versions.Other than that, everything about it looks like it jumped out of an illustration. Vangelis music makes everything grand especially in the hallway of mirrors, and final moments on top of rooftops and final soliloquies have gone on to become immortalised in cinema.Final Verdict: 10/10. A stunning piece that will remain timeless. However, I really am not looking forward to the sequel in production.",10,1,4,24 July 2014
The Deer Hunter," Pretty Unforgettable.
","Where do I begin to tackle 'The Deer Hunter'? Obviously take into consideration that this was one of the first movies on the Vietnam War. 'Apocalypse Now' (1979) was a year away, 'Platoon' (1986) & 'Full Metal Jacket' (1987) would soon follow. That said, imagine how controversial this film must have been being released just 3 years after the end of the war.Another thing I gotta make a point about is that many of my peers have seen this movie and say it's boring and depressing. True I admit that first act is pretty lengthy, and depression is the core driving force of the whole movie anyway. War is S*^t, with a capital 'S'. I find the movies subtle beauty quite remarkable, and a few hours after watching the film did the whole message really sink in and leave me exhausted. The movie is still widely regarded as one of American Cinemas greatest film achievements, right up there with 'The Godfather' (1972). It had really left its mark on me at the time I saw it, and I once considered it in my all time top 5 favourite movies (Only to be replaced by 'Apocalypse Now' 1979, which I saw a year later).Don't come looking for 'Platoon' or 'Full Metal Jacket', this drama is about the consequences and after effects war has on the psyche. The physical and mental wounds given to these three friends (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and John Savage) take their toll, and all of them end up suffering their own kind of personal hell. The performances are incredible with Robert De Niro is in his prime, and as always keeps getting better with every movie at the time. Christopher Walken gives an Oscar winning performance, and I also really ended up caring for Meryl Streep's character which remains extremely grounded. It's surprisingly well done how all three actors work around this 3 way love triangle, which really aids this post traumatic stress between them all.The 3-act movie structure is pretty obvious here. From the small Pennsylvania town wedding, to the friends in conflict forced to play Russian roulette (These scenes are brutal, and have been hailed as a metaphor for the entire War). Finally the third act depicts the effects it has had on everyone, with an ending so downright cruel in some ways it becomes difficult to explain in print.Final Verdict: Overall this felt less like a film and more of an experience, or at least a bloody well made reconstruction or biopic. It's one I think everyone should have to sit down and watch sometime in their life. After everything I have wrote and all the horror and wonder you'll experience, I still find this movie unexplainable. 10/10.",10,0,2,8 September 2014
X2: X-Men United," One Of The Best X-Men Movies Available.
","'X-Men 2' improves on everything the first movie failed to do. The characters have been established, and now we can just be absorbed into the story. This time around we are more lucky when Magneto (Ian McKellen) has a much more sinister plot put together, which will surprisingly unite all the mutants together to take down an even larger threat.Here in this scenario everyone gets a lot more screen time, and an even deeper look into the past of fan-favourite Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who really gets to let loose in this movie (Due to the restricted stabbing notions of the first movie). A lot more fan favourite mutants make appearances as well, such as Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) who was executed perfectly. The relationship between Ice-Man (Shawn Ashmore) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) gets more screen time, and is developed 'well enough'. Colonel. Stryker (Brian Cox) is a fantastic villain choice, and Xavier (Patrick Stewart) actually has something to do that is pivotal to the story and is really well executed.As said earlier, the film is an improvement over everything the first movie validated. The action sequences are somewhat more lengthier and stronger than the last outing, and every scene has a sense of depth and weight that gets more pivotal towards the finale. Dialogue seems more heavy and meaningful between characters, and when you can pull off something as big as 'X-Men', and add those kind of strengths into almost every aspect you have great capable blockbuster success in your hands.Final Verdict: This is a great super-hero movie, and the best of what the original trilogy had to offer. 8/10.",8,0,1,3 September 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Familiar Opening Text Promises Another Tale In a Galaxy Far, Far Away...
","A couple years ago, it was widely reported that Disney acquired Lucasfilm and all of its IP's for a staggeringly large sum of money. What was more of a surprise is that within hours of sealing the deal, Disney had announced to create a further 6 Star Wars movies all to be released by 2020. Maybe it's all too much but look at it this way, the House of Mouse owns male interests for pretty much the rest of their lives, this and Indiana Jones.To Star Wars fans it was a bit of shock when announced that the Expanded Universe had been written out of the series canon, and moved to a new label: 'Star Wars Legends'. Many wonderful twists and turns for beloved characters and events disappeared (As if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror). With canon now being the main movies, Clone Wars, Disney animated show and Marvel comic line (Also owned by Disney), so began the search to find out who would be responsible for starting this new trilogy. It was good to know that Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy would oversee production, 'Little Miss Sunshine' (2006) writer Michael Arndt wrote an initial script and series creator George Lucas served as creative consultant in the early stages of production, using cliff notes from what was originally meant to be a film series over 10 Episodes or so.Many were approached, finally it was announced that J. J. Abrams would be the first director to helm the new Star Wars movie (Initially reluctant as he wanted to enjoy them as a fan). Seeing his work with the latest 'Star Trek' movies, it was safe to say that the man knew how to create exciting movies, especially when it comes to actors interacting with each other and their surroundings (Check out interviews where he talks about building hallways to the Enterprise control room just to get a dynamic shot). With Star Wars somewhat having lost confidence with the audience in recent years (Myself included), two vital decisions from the start was to hire unknown actors to helm these new films (Much like Hamil, Fisher and Ford were back in 1977) and finally go back to more practical methods of special effects and film-making rather than just digital. Trailers launched, segments of film both nostalgic and new appeared as John Williams's sweeping music overwhelmed. It seemed not only a new movie in the franchise was born, but the beginning of something unfamiliar and exciting was about to be told.With Star Wars not only being one of the biggest franchises of all time, it is of course very personal to every member of the audience. I attended the midnight screening on the day of release, sat down with a full house and saw the wonderful tagline in blue font. The screen fades to black, horns blare out and a big nerd tear left my eye. Suddenly Act 1 is over and I'm impressed, Act 2 wraps up and it's overall satisfying. Finally Act 3 concludes and I'm overwhelmed. The places we visit and the creatures we see all point to exciting possibilities for the future. But it must be mentioned that Episode 7: The Force Awakens is pretty much 'A New Hope', with some darker elements of 'The Empire Strikes Back' (Which makes sense as Lawrence Kasdan, writer of Episode 5 and 6 rewrote some of Arndt's script with Abrams). It wasn't a bad film, far from it. It was actually lovely to see our favourite classic characters essentially give their blessing to the wonderful young talent who easily reassure they could helm the rest of the trilogy themselves. Upon reflection a few villains though intimidating proved to be a little underwhelming for now, but I look forward to seeing what this new threat will develop into given where we leave off at the end of this chapter.Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac deliver wonderful performances of already now memorable characters. Though there yet stands to be a larger interaction between all three of them, Rey (Daisy) and Finn (John) generally come across as well developed young adults thrown into their situation, and the friendship between Finn and Poe Dameron (Oscar) is undeniably unique and fun. Daisy Ridley stood out as a leading lady and the much needed female presence for this franchise (It has felt like a much longer time without a Princess Leia), for a first time big performance I sense a great future career ahead of her. But ultimately the highlight, glue, heart and soul of the movie belongs to Harrison Ford, who returned to the Han Solo character as if he never left. For a man now 73 years of age who moved on from the franchise long ago, to see him return on top form and dare I say better than ever, will most likely melt any cynical heart. Andy Serkis, Gwendoline Christie and Adam Driver provide enough to make the mysterious 'First Order' genuinely come off threatening, and new droids like BB-8 remain very expressive thanks to great puppeteer work. Carrie Fisher warmly returns to ever provide reason and for those wondering on the absence of Mark Hamil will definitely be surprised or find solace until Episode 8 in 2017.Final Verdict: What is the greatest strength of The Force Awakens? Harrison Ford to be exact, but its greatest strength is that the Force actually feels mysterious again. Though there are many twists and turns and throwbacks to the original trilogy, to actually see this magical plot device become present again all whilst having this heavy foreshadowing just looming over the story makes it all very engaging. Hopefully the next instalment will pretty much say goodbye to nostalgia and leave it entirely in the hands of our new characters. To wonder and see where all this will be leading to by 2020 leaves me extremely optimistic. J. J. Abrams and Co. you did it. 9/10.",9,4,30,17 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Goodbye Mr. Potter.
","First things first, do the smart thing and see it in 2-D.Finally, we come to the end of the critically well received 'Harry Potter' franchise. It doesn't seem long that 10 years ago we looked upon Hogwarts for the first time, and knew we would have so many enjoyable years with 3 very talented actors. I'm sure they will have very long careers ahead.Beginning with a recap of where the first part left off. Harry, Ron and Hermione continue there mission. Leading into the wizarding bank, and finally a large scale battle at Hogwarts school. The best thing about this instalment is David Yates directing. The way he managed to pull off the slow-motion in wide angles and uncomfortable close ups shots, made for a 'Harry Potter' movie that just felt beyond what it was visually capable of. Making every big moment all the more bigger. Seeing Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) interact and fight it out with each other is without doubt, one of the series highlights for the past couple instalments.Aside from that, when they arrive back in Hogwarts everything kicks off. Old friends are reacquainted, special effect laden spells fill the skies and hallways, all towards the final revelations discovered at the end of the movie (Without doubt a stunning performance from Alan Rickman). All building up to the final minutes where Harry's wizarding life all began is just extremely satisfying. I just wished that makeup was a little better.Final Verdict: Without doubt a satisfying, stunning conclusion to one of cinema's most highest grossing franchises of all time. A very big thank you to the talented people, who have worked on these movies and have entertained me for the past 10 years. 8/10.",8,0,4,29 August 2014
Kagemusha," What A Nightmare Comes From This Burden
","The smoke in 'Kagemusha' lingers in my mind, whether it comes from the morning fog over a lake, or the end of a barrel from a gun in its spectacular battle sequences. Tatsuya Nakadai plays both the Warlord and the Imposter, and how captivating he remains during this plight. Though Toho Studios couldn't afford to complete the movie, longtime Kurosawa enthusiasts George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola convinced 20th Century Fox to pay the remaining budget for international distribution rights. Lucas and Coppola were awarded executive producer credits.Set in the Sengoku period of Japan, a thief is spared death and taught to impersonate a dying warlord in order to dissuade opposing lords from attacking the vulnerable clan for the next few years. Though initially reluctant and unworthy, the imposter begins to earn the clans respect and comes to enjoy the love of his people and his position. The story is based on daimyo Takeda Shingen, and the film culminates with a stunning portrayal of the 1575 Battle of Nagashino.The colours of this movie are beautiful, the highlight being the unforgettable 'nightmare' sequence in all its gorgeous silence. Shintaro Katsu (Famous for playing blind blade master 'Zatoichi', for some 25 movies) was originally the lead, however he supposedly angered Kurosawa when he brought people along to film Kurosawa's directing abilities. This lead to the employment of Mr. Nakadai, and easily remains his best performance in his line of Kurosawa pictures. Sure he already appeared as the Uber cool gunman in 'Yojimbo' (1961), and would also go on to portray a heartbreaking rendition of insanity in 'Ran' (1985). Here he is two separate people imitating the other one seamlessly. Being a 3 hour picture and in terms of pacing it is possibly the slowest of Kurosawa's filmography, and I think 20 minutes of this movie could be removed and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. With all that said though, 'Kagemusha' won the 1980 Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and I still remember all of its imagery vividly.Final Verdict: One of Kurosawa's last great epics, and certainly one of his period drama's worth watching. 9/10.",9,1,1,14 February 2015
The Truman Show," The Best Thing We Watched In Religion Studies
","As you get older and try to find your way in life. You'd be forgiven for thinking someone is watching what you're doing, especially with the abundance of CCTV nowadays.That's what inevitably happens in the life of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey). Unfortunately he's not gazed upon for reasons of security, as he is unaware his life is actually a 24/7 hour show for the rest of the world. From womb to tomb, his actions have kept millions enthralled, but a few broken set pieces and a lost love may finally pull the blanket over Truman's eyes.This is probably Jim Carrey at his most mature so far. He's a performer who has such a wonderful bounce in his step, that makes him devilishly cartoony in everything he's ever done both comedic and serious. Ed Harris is fantastic as the show runner, and for as serious as the film gets emotionally. I don't think it ever underwhelms or overwhelms either.Regardless, you sympathise with Truman because his life has been manipulated so well. But maybe that was another subtle point the movie was making, that someone's misery is abused for ratings despite differences from right and wrong? Saying that, I don't really think I'd ever question my existence to the extent of Truman's, and I really admire this quotation from director Peter Wier: 'This was a dangerous film to make because it couldn't happen. How ironic.' Final Verdict: An American classic, and a unique film that begs multiple viewings. 9/10.",9,0,1,8 August 2014
The Matrix," For Its Time, Utter fantastic.
","Again this is another film that was made at the same time 'Star Wars Episode 1' (1999) was around, and the CGI looks definitively better. 'The Matrix' was a welcoming edition to the Sci-Fi genre, Inspired by the Wachowski siblings love of cyberpunk, Japanese martial arts and Lewis Carroll. It has an extremely interesting synopsis about reality, considering the dawn of the information age.Reality (Seen by most humans) is actually a simulation defined as 'The Matrix', created by sentient machines to wipe out the human population by farming and using their bodies as an energy source. A computer programmer 'Neo' (Keanu Reeves) learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, involving other people who have been freed from this 'dream world'. All are being chased by 'Agents' led by the more ruthless 'Agent Smith' (Hugo Weaving), who wants to stop them from leaving the mainframe. Keanu Reeves is as wonderfully bland as ever, but turns in a decent performance. Carrie-Anne Moss's character 'Trinity' became more likable over sequels, and of course Laurence Fishburne as 'Morpheus' definitely remained the most respectable character throughout the franchise. Either way you look at it the show stealer's is a balance between Laurence Fishburne & Hugo Weaving, their performances are either way over the top or just spot on.Other than that, it's a spectacle in set pieces, choreography and directing. So many scenes are almost dream like in their fabricated quality, along with the 'reality' sequences that look really dirty and trashed. 'Bullet Time' became much more prominently used after the movie, and everyone would start dressing like the characters as parodies were spawned and the comic book reader in me felt that it was heavily similar to Grant Morrison's 'The Invisibles' (1994-2000).Final Verdict: If you want A+ action and CGI, mixed with superb Martial Arts in a western landscape. Then I cannot recommend 'The Matrix' enough. 10/10.",10,2,6,12 September 2014
Godzilla," A Worthy Entry But This God Is Flawed.
","I have problems with this movie. I wish I could love it, given that we've all heard so much about it finally happening back in 2010. One hour before I went to see it, I watched a 12-minute behind the scenes featurette to see all the talent and effort that went into literally bringing Godzilla to life, only to see him appear roughly 20 minutes throughout a 2 hour movie. Even the villain MUTO (A new American monster) gets a little more screen time in a film that can be summed up thusly: Act 1. was Fantastic. Arguably the flick feels it was made for those uninitiated to the monster or franchise, and everything you need to know is brought up to scratch in those superb opening credits. Characters are established swiftly, plus a very engaging performance from Bryan Cranston (Who should have also gotten more screen time) and the main villain is established. Act 2. is sadly dull. The military prove futile (In a Godzilla movie who knew?) as we are following lone soldier Ford (Aaron Taylor Johnson) in undoubtedly very atmospheric set pieces, yet boring exposition that kills pacing and skips over the monsters fighting in Hawaii. Also another MUTO arrives, who is larger and is a female planning to reproduce (I would have thought they would like to have strayed as far away from the 1998 film as possible). Act 3. we see monsters finally fighting, and IT IS A SPECTACLE TO BEHOLD. In a day and age where disaster movies like 'Transformers' happen, stuff is obviously going to be heavily destroyed without much regard to peoples safety. The amount of debris and smoke rising around these monsters give such a weight to the scope and image, it definitely exceeds what your expectations were. Unfortunately by the end you just wished the movie focused more on these monsters instead of the cut and paste characters.This is where a level of bias may come into the review, but hear me out. The 1954 movie featured only Godzilla, and small scenes of people's reactions to the devastation he commits. All of this eventually leads to a solution that while simple continues to provide a very strong anti War message. All following sequels eventually had him fighting all manner of creative monsters, and that became everything those movies were built around. Personal preference, but if you're going to have three gorgeously rendered monsters in a movie with such a fantastic climax, chances are that's what people want to see more than the human side of the story. Albeit one that was OK, but got very lost midway.Aside from the horrible things I've said, this movie has some wonderful acting especially from Cranston & Ken Watanabe. The camera shots were superb, and I'd still say Gareth Edwards was the best choice for this movie. However, it strangely just doesn't feature Godzilla as much as a 'Godzilla' movie should, and it all feels more like a sequel to Edwards 2010 flick 'Monsters'. They'd also probably been better off including another monster, rather than just a larger, female MUTO.Final Verdict: When all is said and done the story was okay, the set pieces are stunning and when Godzilla showed up, HE SHOWED UP. After a decades absence, the 'King of the Monsters' can still bring me back to the joys I had watching it as a child. Hopefully with the success it's having, it will demand a more solid follow up in the future. 7/10.",7,1,3,18 May 2014
Casino," Lengthly, But Still Quintessential Scorsese.
","'Casino', remains another superb masterpiece by Martin Scorsese. Sadly this film is not really talked about enough, or at least among my peers. Many seem to acknowledge it's brilliance and just say 'Oh yeah, that's the head in a vice movie'.Like 'Goodfellas' (1990) before it, the film is based on another True story. Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro), is called by the mob to oversee the day to day operations of the most successful Casino in Vegas. As we see, 'Ace' is constantly on duty, yet successfully is running the business to it's full potential. Along the way we meet Sam's old friend Nicholas 'Nicky' Santoro (Joe Pesci), an extremely volatile man who would kill you if you even made eye contact. Later he is also introduced to extensive gold-digger Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), whom Sam falls for and eventually marries unaware she's still with her slimy con man boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Ultimately these encounters mean doom for every one of them, among the inevitable collapse of the mob's power.'Casino', maybe just for it's length is an epic movie. Showcasing both the familiar tropes of violence and greed, which leads to the downfall of any human being. But the genius is that all these people suffer different forms of fatalities, both seen before and some surprisingly original. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are as great as ever in these kind of movies. It's great to see both tread familiar grounds, read exposition while the story continues and still assume different characters. James Woods was extremely subtle in his role, which works well for him as I did not recognise him in the beginning. Finally Sharon Stone's character is somewhat the emphasis of the entire movie, and she delivers that Oscar nominated performance so tight as the object of lust it's astounding. Funny enough is that I absolutely hate her in these kind of roles because she's so good at them, all in all making her the perfect choice.Final Verdict: Though the film is long, those who can sit through it are in for another great piece from Scorsese's filmography. 8/10.",8,1,1,6 September 2014
Heat," A Great Hit From The 1990's, Go Michael Mann.
","A truly great idea for a 1990's blockbuster, made all the more bigger by announcing it would finally feature two of the finest American actors to ever grace the screen (Robert De Niro & Al Pacino). 'HEAT', is a powerful movie with many meaningful moments, and a downtown L.A shootout scene regarded as one of the very best.We follow the life of professional thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), who frequently commits high profit crimes with him gang (Among them is Val Kilmer, who is also fantastic). As they prepare to go their separate ways they decide to commit one final heist, before some face the challenge of settling into their new kind of 'Retired' lifestyle. At the same time we cut to the lifestyle of Police Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), facing heat (Pun intended) from both his wife and work life. All this and more while trying to help his young severely depressed step-daughter (Natalie Portman).Throughout the film which is admittedly quite lengthy, it shines most of all when De Niro and Pacino meet. Their first tense confrontation starts at the coffee shop as both find themselves being not so different from each other, to the next time when they're shooting away at each other senselessly. All in all, the film builds to an obvious yet satisfying climax that makes you wonder all along who you were rooting for. 'Heat' is very admirable. Michael Mann obviously had great affection for his story, and he executes the style perfectly. Watching that iconic shoot-out on a big TV with a loud surround system, is an experience every action film lover has to witness.Final Verdict: Add the family morales that John Woo would incorporate, along with the suspenseful face-to-face moments you would swear Hitchcock influenced them. All makes 'HEAT' one hell of a force to be reckoned with. 9/10.",9,1,4,4 September 2014
Ran," Akira Kurosawa's Masterpiece.
","Kurosawa's last epic and the most expensive Japanese film of its time, 'Ran' is the result of a master of his craft firing on a cylinders. Whilst my favourite of his work still remains 'Ikiru' (1952), there is no doubt 'Ran' is his masterpiece. The colours and level of detail the director went for is jaw dropping, spending 10 years storyboarding the film as paintings, even mourning the death of his wife for one day before returning to shooting the next. Kurosawa's ambitions and mad dedication pours out of every frame, and the results is one of those unforgettable 'landmark' movies that can easily be considered among the greatest ever made.As we all know the man particularly excels at Shakespeare such as 'Throne of Blood' (A 'Macbeth' adaptation from 1957), 'Ran' is based on the legends of the daimyo Mōri Motonari, as well as the tragedy 'King Lear'. Set in the Sengoku-era, Tatsuya Nakadai stars as Hidetora Ichimonji, an ageing warlord who decides to retire and separate the land between his three sons. Unfortunately the news does not bode well among the siblings, leading to events and betrayal that will leave the whole kingdom in jeopardy.I've said it before in my review of 'Kagemusha' (1980), the colours of a Kurosawa movie are unmatched in their 'saturated', watercolour like quality. And a particular silent battle scene speaks volumes when you see light pouring out the darkest of clouds, and the crimson red blood stain every wall. The theme of Nihilism is ever present, and obviously Kurosawa was more known for favouring Humanism among his work (There are a few brief glimpses in this tragedy that do show signs of redemption). But I think the ambitions of each individual is perfectly represented, with all their greed leading to their eventual demise.Tatsuya Nakadi stars in his last collaboration with this director, and his performance as the warlord descending into insanity is believable every step of the way. Though I'm not all to familiar with it, the film has been noted for its reminiscence of Japanese 'Noh' theatre, and an extensive use of wardrobe for its 1000+ extras (The movie won an Academy award for its costumes). The dialogue driven story is fantastic, and the camera-work has that look about it that remains effortless.Final Verdict: I've praised this film enough, and I cannot think of any faults or shortcomings whatsoever. I hope you see it and become overwhelmed at its beauty, or at least its scope and efforts broaden your horizons. 10/10.",10,0,2,14 February 2015
Pineapple Express," One Of The More Out Of Control Stoner Comedies.
","Saul (James Franco), is hitch-hiking down the road with his thumb sticking out of his zipper... 'Check it out my thumb looks like my Dick!'. Just one of the many laughs of this twisted flick, which was probably one of the funniest movies of 2008.Really what works so well with this movie is just to see how well the dialogue bounces off between all three leads. Seth Rogen, James Franco & Danny McBride have some wonderful chemistry between each other, and this hybrid comedy has it's ups and downs. But ultimately, if you wanna see how loose and out of control the writing of Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen can get, 'Pineapple Express' (So far) has some pretty crazy scenario's that I couldn't help but find myself laughing.Final Verdict: Pure fun with comical violence. 7/10.",7,2,4,8 September 2014
Sin City," As Far As Adapting Source Material Goes, It's Pretty Flawless.
","'Sin City', came out in 2005 and really makes use of its 18 certificate, delivering a more than faithful adaptation of three of Frank Miller's yarns. Considering I was 13 at the time of it's release, looking back it really had quite the ensemble cast for the genre. Now as a 22 year old having read the books, Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller & Quentin Tarantino did a superb job in literally bringing the black and white off the pages and onto the screen.'The Hard Goodbye' is about Marv (Mickey Rourke), who begins an investigation to find who killed his one night stand sweetheart. 'The Big Fat Kill' focuses on Dwight (Clive Owen), caught in the middle of a street war between the prostitutes of 'Old town', and a group of mercenaries. 'That Yellow Bastard' follows ageing police officer John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), who protects a young woman from a paedophile serial killer, who later becomes grotesquely disfigured. Finally, the 2 minute intro and finale of the film are based on 'The Customer is Always Right', a short story from another book in the series.The narrative structure benefits from telling some portions of each story out of chronology. It's not particularly fantastic, but it is nevertheless implemented and works surprisingly well. I say this only because the home release extended cut decides to tell each story separate and because of it, it loses it's tightly weaved structure. Regardless, it didn't hinder my enjoyment of the movie in the slightest.Of course what really distinguishes itself from the rest of it's comic book counterparts is its style. After all the good I have to say about 'Sin City', I'm not the biggest fan of the books. I love their classic noir stories, characters and dialogue. However, some of it is really badly written, repetitious as all hell and like 80% of Frank's work, every female is a prostitute. The 'Sin City' movie takes all the best material the books have to offer, and elevates it somewhat with really talented performers and recreating some scenes right out of the book itself.Other than that, I urge you to read up on how they made the movie. It's pretty spectacular when you realise that some of the interactions between the actors never happened, as they were still awaiting to be casted. The few colours they choose to implement is sparse yet effective, when you see it all in it's entirety the CGI visuals are pretty unforgettable. Some of my peers won't watch a classic 1940's film-noir story, yet they'll watch 'Sin City'. I've got to get some new friends.Final Verdict: As I write, 'Sin City' is nearly a decade old. Yet the execution and efforts of everyone involved are going to make it somewhat timeless, and some of the best of genre has to offer. 10/10.",10,2,3,2 September 2014
Gangs of New York," Good But Not Scorsese Good.
","It's an extremely well done film, but not one of Scorsese's best. His first feature in seven years since 'Casino' (1995) is a return to top form, however at 2 hours 40 minutes I find that the movie tends to drag on considerably.Actually this film is the one where I started really enjoying Leonardo DiCaprio as a performer. Sure I liked him enough in 'The Beach' (2000), but here is where I start to believe his leading man capabilities. I also enjoy Cameron Diaz's performance though I never thought too much of her character, and as much as Daniel Day Lewis is a superb actor I think his performance is sometimes way over the top than memorable.For as silly as this film can get, it's very well lit and the organisation and scope for some of these fights is undeniably impressive. The last 30 minutes is a spectacle but the ending never got to me, regardless how poignantly it was presented.Final Verdict: It may not be the greatest entry in Scorsese's unbelievable filmography, but this is still worth watching overall. 7/10.",7,0,0,21 August 2014
Spectre," The Daniel Craig Era Of James Bond Movies Continues To Borrow Heavily From The Series Iconic Moments, But Also Continues To Remain Very Entertaining.
","It is in many ways extremely simple to review the James Bond movies. You always know there will be exotic locations, girls, cars, gadgets and in the latest outing there is no exception. I really enjoyed the previous entry 'Skyfall' (2012), and that movie has somewhat been a lightning rod when discussing it with my friends (Especially my old film school teacher). If there is any criticism I have it is that this latest mission certainly draws out the familiar traits a bit too much over its 2 hour 20 minute running time. But with all the different locations that is traversed and outlandish stunt work that could be CGI or not, 'Spectre' has more than enough action sequences to remain an enjoyable entry in this ever growing franchise.If you've been following all the Daniel Craig series of movies, 'Spectre' pretty much continues the storyline of this shadowy organisation and introduces the superb Christoph Waltz and Dave Bautista as the new villains. Dialogue is sharp and witty, but the themes of global surveillance while prominent are really not that interesting (Especially when the series is trying to continue this '00 agents are unimportant nowadays' side story). Certainly though events escalate, and some of the areas traversed offer beautiful modern kitsch designed buildings in the middle of nowhere. Overall for a fan it's nostalgic and pretty fantastic.Call me simply pleased as well, but the movie opens up with a fantastic 3 minute long tracking shot that dips in, outside and around buildings (Reminiscent of Orson Welles's classic opening scene in 1958's 'Touch of Evil'). I won't spoil anymore for you, but that pretty much remained one of the highlights of the movie for me. Whereas I think Sam Smith is a very capable singer, I didn't really think much of his lyrics attached to the theme song and I don't think it'll age as well as the other iconic songs of the franchise (Though I will admit the cascading melody is a powerful one and well utilised throughout the movie). Daniel Craig continues to remain perfect for the role, and Lea Seydoux is quite possibly one of the best bond girls the franchise has ever had (Monica Bellucci also shines in the small screen time she has also, why all the media attention of an older bond girl I don't know).Final Verdict: Other than some of the product placements in the film being fairly shameless, it certainly lives up to the shadowy organisation the film is named after (Though the way they chose to re-invent a classic villain the way they did is the definition of un-original). It's flashy, the set pieces are great and if this is to be the last outing for Daniel Craig it is certainly the best way to go. I got to enjoy it in an audience of over 700, and when I used the men's bathroom afterwards Sheena Easton's 'For Your Eyes Only' was playing. Director Sam Mendes and Eon productions have made a very enjoyable, yet paint by numbers entry of the franchise. 7/10.",7,12,31,26 October 2015
Moon," In Space, Only You Can Hear Yourself Scream.
","Science fiction continues to be my favourite genre, and 'Moon' has been one of those movies I've been wanting to watch since the marketing was very unique (The director started out in advertising that I was familiar with). My god it was amazing, and the special effects and overall production had only cost 5 million. It really shows it doesn't matter how much money you put into a movie for critical success, and the praise for this story comes from the amazing 'performances' of Sam Rockwell, and the vocal performance from Kevin Spacey.In the future, we've discovered a new fuel source on the moon's surface via the suns rays. A company builds a mining facility run by Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), who near the end of his three year contract has an accident in his lunar rover. Suddenly, he awakens back at the plant without any memory or recollection of how he got back. Due to limited contact between him & the people back on Earth, the company sends a message planning to make their way to fix something broken and should arrive within three days. Leaving Sam to figure out what happened.It's a great looking movie, that has captivated me many viewings. The dialogue scenes between Sam and A.I. 'GERTY' (Kevin Spacey) are great, and Duncan Jones's previous commercial work help create impressive effects on a budget. Final things to mention are the wonderful influences to past classics like 'Silent Running' (1972), and a fantastic score provided by Clint Mansell.Final Verdict: It met all of my expectations and beyond. An amazing debut from Duncan Jones. 8.5/10.",8,1,4,12 August 2014
Her," The Turing Test Of The Future.
","One thing I need to get off my mind is that while watching the movie I thought if we switched the gender roles around, all I could think was; 'The Machines are trying to F£%^! our women'.I'm currently 22, and if you can believe it I don't own an iPhone (I have an Android, and in context that's probably worse for my understanding when regarding the latest equipment). I've only ever owned a phone for the sole purpose of calling and texting, in many ways I still cannot believe I can listen to my music and take such pictures of quality with it. I bring this up because everyone I know that owns this technology is constantly plugged in. I laugh a little as I'm at college and see people so absorbed in apps, it can get pretty startling how attached people get to these things when you have to pull them out of it to start a discussion. Now onto the review of which is undoubtedly the most strange, quirky movie of 2013 (As far as mainstream cinema goes).Enter the year 2025, and we meet Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix). A shy man going through a rough time who upgrades his computer to the latest OS (Operating System), which has this incredible ability not only to adapt to suit his personal needs, but also learn, sense and actually love. The OS named 'Samantha' (Fantastically voiced by Scarlett Johansson) and Theodore then begin some form of 'Quasi' relationship, and given the melancholic indie upbringing this generation currently lives in it's pretty hard not to get charmed instantly. The supporting cast and naivety of Amy Adams, Chris Pratt & Rooney Mara are great as all are wonderful performers, but throughout this films pretty lengthy running time we're stuck in isolation with Theodore & Samantha falling further in love, writing Oscar-nominated songs and generally bouncing off each other very well.The difficulties I have accepting this movie is that I've never been connected that emotionally to a computer, regardless the levels of conscience they might eventually possess. What I do commend however, is that Spike Jonze has created a very beautiful looking movie that's a welcome addition to his eccentric filmography. A few tracking shots here and there show this sprawling metropolis so alive with people and technology, you'd think he actually managed to glimpse the future and put some of it in his picture. That and it's a very well lit film, and I think that 'beach' scenario with its music and imagery could easily be the scene I'll remember most. Unfortunately as said earlier, the only thing that stops the movie from earning full marks is the lack of any stellar conflict. Sure there is plenty of little arguments to somewhat show a healthy and familiar 'coupling', but there is really never a serious conflict or exchange between them that feels detrimental or different than just saying 'yes' to a bunch of questions. Final Verdict: In reality, Spike Jonze gave us a love story that has some very tender moments that will clearly find an audience in this day and age. But personally what I saw or at least what I felt I saw were the dangers of getting this close to technology, and the somewhat tragedy Samantha wasn't flesh and bone. It's a lovely movie filled with wonderful writing and melancholic themes Jonze is unique for. 8/10.",8,0,0,15 March 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Oh Max Where Have You Been? You've Been Sorely Missed.
","2015 is gearing up to be an interesting year for Hollywood. A couple of anticipated comic book movies as usual, a few remakes and reboots of course and finally the next instalment of the 'Mad Max' franchise after 30 years of absence. We've all been anticipating it for too long, as a fourth in the series was to be released 8 years ago with Mel Gibson returning as the titular character. Unfortunately 9/11 happened and the Australian dollar collapsed, the Iraq War caused problems via travelling to Namibia and Gibson lost interest. After series creator George Miller finished the 'Happy Feet' series, he finally returned to the project with five storyboard artists producing 3,500 art panels, a $150 million budget and then co-writing a script with 2000AD comic writer Brenan McCarthy, and Australian actor Nico Lathouris. The world is an Apocalyptic wasteland, desert for miles and miles. Max (Tom Hardy) experiences lucid hallucinations of a troubling past, and is soon captured by a pale skinned cult ruled by the tyrannical leader King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the lead villain 'Toecutter' in the original 1979 'Mad Max'). While off on a usual gasoline run, Joe's right hand woman Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), drives off course holding certain cargo that leads Joe and his assembled army to go after her with Max strapped on the hood of a car along for the ride. An epic chase ensues, with all the traps of the land and various gangs not so far behind.What sets this apart from every other movie at the moment? Miller took particular influence from silent movies, 85% of the stunts are ALL practical and 480 hours of filmed footage has resulted in a 2 hour spectacle that delivered way beyond what I ever expected. For all the trailers we've seen with Giuseppe Verdi's music blaring out loud, the level of Punk in this movie is far beyond anything Hollywood has produced in years and surprisingly more violent than your average 15 rated feature (Even when it's off camera). It was like a mix between an old John Waters and Alejandro Jodorowsky picture, and recent Japanese extreme cinema was the only modern comparison I can think of (Something Miller wanted to somewhat approach).Tom Hardy is our new Max and does fine work as always, though he somewhat plays a supporting character rather than a leading role this time. Max to me has always sort of represented the everyman rising to the situation, and I'm already enthusiastic should Tom return to the character again. Charlize Theron somewhat stole the show for me (Which has led to some hilarious Anti-feminist responses from 'men'), and really was every bit as strong as they made her character out to be. Nicholas Hoult's character was surprisingly charming, and no other actor or actress turned in a bad performance. The criticism I would have is that while Hugh Keays-Byrne turned in a good performance, the villain wasn't particularly imposing, memorable or even felt threatening (A discount 'Lord Humungous' from Mad Max 2, if you will).I admit to having a weakness when it comes to the 'Mad Max' franchise, because I have surprisingly enjoyed all of them but never really experienced them for the acting or even the cars. I simply am a lover of Punk, and I adore the outlandish style over substance Miller has crafted and exaggerated as time goes on. While 'Fury Road' has made improvements over the predecessors, I still only saw a movie of style over substance. The blue-orange colour scheme was gorgeous, music by Junkie XL was suitable and the stunt work was so phenomenal it made me remember why I loved these movies so much. Miller stated in an interview that 'Fury Road' contains 2,700 cuts over two hours (Apparently that's 22.5 cuts per minute), and while it all adds to this movies fast one of a kind style, some of the clarity in the stunt work is sacrificed as a result (Studio movies gotta look like a studio movie).Final Verdict: When all is said and done, Mad Max came back with a large budget and I fell in love with it all over again instantly. While 'The Road Warrior' remains my favourite of the bunch, this certainly ain't your daddy's Mad Max. Gone are the desires for gas and bullets, this one somewhat deals with human trafficking and surprisingly remained refreshing, new and somewhat nostalgic. Loud and furious, when the credits rolled I wanted to stay in the seat and watch it again and again. 'What a lovely day' indeed. 10/10.",10,10,25,14 May 2015
Donnie Darko," As Good As I Remember It.
","'Donnie Darko', was a really stylish and interesting piece of film for the new Millennium. It felt like a satire of young adults trying to fight off boredom and find meaning through something, anything no matter how absurd. It's incredibly hard to discuss because the film is somewhat hard to understand, and deciphering the meanings in this review would rob you of a great experience you'll find yourself coming back to. So I guess I'll abruptly try to end this review by talking about the other aspects.Well the acting was great. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie is unique, and definitely promises more to come from this talented actor. His family are arseholes because they don't really talk to him, rather they just send him off to a shrink. Leading to more visions of 'Frank', a gruesome man sized rabbit creature that became very memorable and also has a very unique presence given the movies finale. Modern American suburbia is the perfect setting for the crazy events that ensues, leading to an almost anti 'American Beauty' (1999) vibe.Final Verdict: 'Donnie Darko' is one of those movies that will be talked about for a long time no matter how old it gets. I enjoy coming back to it again and again. 8/10.",8,0,3,15 September 2014
Goodfellas," Go Liotta!
","Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and an outstanding job from Ray Liotta. 'Goodfellas' has everything that says priceless, as well as adding some new values to the lifestyle. Dare I say it modernises both the look and era of the genre, to which many still consider it the best gangster flick to come out since 'The Godfather' (1972). It's a bold statement, and I just don't think it's that same level of good. Still pretty fantastic regardless.As story goes it's pretty strong. Based on the real events of gangster-turned informative Henry Hill (Played by Liotta), it tells his story of growing up in organised crime and his somewhat 'initiation', that ultimately leads to him meeting Jimmy 'The Gent' Conway (Robert De Niro), and loose cannon Tommy DeVito (An Oscar winning performance by Joe Pesci). From then on we as an audience grow up with Henry Hill and his ageing, his addiction to drugs, his time in prison and the meeting of his future wife. All of it portrayed as a 'glamorous' lifestyle, or as a stick of dynamite with the fuse nearly out. During the 1970's, the gang commits the infamous Lufthansa Heist, and starts killing off other members from rival gangs to assure dominance. Bizarrely, they start offing their own as well to assert their power, will Henry survive?Well again, tops to Martin Scorsese. Truly the best man you could want behind the camera for this kind of genre. Every detail in the background is crisp, and the shadows in the corners of the frame have never looked so menacing and unsafe. Broad, dark and flashy, 'Goodfellas' is a great film. Luckily for us Scorsese would revisit this kind of lifestyle a few years later in 'Casino' (1995), but since then nothing has felt quite like this and I can't think of a 1990's gangster film that compliments the old tropes of the genre. As piles and piles of new-age British gangster movies appear, they all deal with nothing but sex, drugs, football and money. There are no values in these movies that come off legitimate anymore.Final Verdict: A landmark film to kick off the 1990's, 'Goodfellas' is the kind of movie that just gets better with age. 9/10.",9,0,0,6 September 2014
The Martian," Not Destined To Be One Of His Best, But Another Strong Movie From Sir Ridley Scott And Matt Damon.
","Ah 'The Martian', you kind of crept up on me. The last big must sees for the end of the year is the next James Bond feature 'Spectre', and of course a return to the great long running space opera 'Star Wars Episode 7'. It's been kind of nice just to have the first trailer peak my interest enough to go see it, and now all I want to do is read the book and see any differences between them. Upon leaving the theatre a few reactions I heard from the audience were 'On the edge of my seat, but way too technical for me to understand it'. Really? I am in no means a scientist at all and have no deep knowledge on NASA protocols, but I feel Drew Goddard's script did justice in simplifying it well enough therefore keeping it fairly smarter than the average blockbuster overall. Matt Damon stars as an astronaut who in a sand storm is presumed dead and left behind on Mars, and then has to fight to survive on a planet where nothing grows (Luckily he's a botanist). What proceeds is a fun 2 and a half hours of you either die or just get on with it, and luckily everyone in the movie has something to get on with. Even though there really is quite the ensemble cast Damon's character and scenario is the only stuff I really cared for, so much so his positivity is sickening (In a good way). Just to say we've seen Matt surprisingly pop up in many space movies recently such as Neill Blomkamp's 'Elysium' (2013), and Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar' (2014). All have been visually stunning and again it has been nice to have him in a strong lead role again.If anything I was particularly overwhelmed at the production quality and just how well Mars had been portrayed. Apparently Wadi Rum in Jordan has been used in many movies set on Mars, and the fact that Ridley Scott used only 20 sets and filmed it all in just 70 days just shows how effortlessly the man still produces great quality movies after making so many. Other than that, the space suits had a bit of 'Prometheus' (2012) nostalgia to me, and the music by composer Harry Gregson-Williams (Known mostly for the Metal Gear Solid video game series) led itself to many great moments of character reflections that didn't include famous disco hits (Not that I think anyone will complain).Final Verdict: Just to extend the review out a little longer, it is nice to see some of these movies are somewhat encouraging peoples interest in NASA again, especially since the recent discovery of water on Mars has led to the debate of some real exploration going on. I enjoyed the movie a lot, but I'll possibly find the movie harder again to watch a second time. The stuff on earth is nowhere near as appealing as the stuff happening on Mars, and Matt Damon's character is so infinitely resourceful I found no real conflict in the scenarios as he has this infectious 'MacGyver' can do attitude. Maybe the film would have benefited with a little more desperation or isolation I don't know, but I'm sure in the future it will enjoy a 'Silent Running' (1972) level of cult classic. If you care for a level of real science with your entertainment it's certainly more than worth your time. 8/10.",8,3,7,7 October 2015
Evil Dead II," Evil Dead 1.5.
","Is 'Evil Dead 2' better than the first one? Depending on your tastes I guess it's entirely debatable, but to me 'Evil Dead 2' is a superior quasi-sequel remake that builds upon the comedy and bloodshed. Taking it to new levels of absurd, when I first saw this movie at the age of 16 I can happily say it would take over the next 6 months of my life. It started to disrupt my schoolwork, I would show friends and talk about this movie so profusely, I would actually be upset if the person I was explaining it to hadn't seen it.Almost like a parody of the first movie, we have Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda, take a romantic getaway to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. After coming across a certain tape recorder, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology professor who begins reciting passages from the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead). This leads to the unleashing of various demons and spirits, who are nothing but blood thirsty.Ash gets a lot more developed now, and it makes us really connect with the character better. Also that has to be mentioned is the level of slapstick Bruce Campbell has to endure this time around, it has me laughing every time I see it. Sam Raimi continues to incorporate a lot more unique camera techniques, and I feel that the scene where the POV shot of Ash being chased around the house has to be one of the best horror scenes ever. When everything is said and done, the film does extraordinary well in keeping us entertained with great make-up, gore, and laughter from all inanimate objects. In many ways I see it as some kind of obscure live action 'Looney Tunes' episode, but to see parts of 'The Evil Dead' (1981) redone with a larger budget kind of makes me respect this one just a little more.Final Verdict: Shows that a movie can succeed without much of a story, and can totally keep the laughs up strong. It's great to see a sequel that doesn't have to entirely repeat itself in order to capitalise on the success of the original. 10/10.",10,3,4,8 September 2014
The Godfather," The Greatest Cast For A Movie Ever.
","Regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. 'The Godfather' is a beloved classic about organised crime, and the Sicilian lifestyles in America. Of course the movie is about the building of a dynasty, a business built on death, murder and betrayal that goes on to run itself on favours and illegal pleasures. However, in this story we see the life of Don Vito Corleone (Played to a tee by the magnificent Marlon Brando), giving favours on his daughter's Wedding day. Here we see a loving, caring man who is both equally loved and feared. So far in the movie, it has had fair tension and introduced us to the family. Then all of a sudden a film-maker awakens to find his prized race horse's head under his bed sheets, and suddenly the tensions of this movie rises considerably.Without really explaining anything else (I mean I really shouldn't have to), our focus is on the youngest Corleone son Michael (Stunning work from Al Pacino). As a man of considerable morals and high grounds, how far will he be willing to go when push comes to shove? Lets just say 'Falls from grace' is a perfect statement, befitting of this rich 'Sepia' toned movie.Something of a Masterpiece when the film came out back in 1972. 'The Godfather', has only gotten better of age. There are so many iconic quotes and moments in the movie, and the cast is just seriously one of the best ever put to film. James Caan I hardly recognised, and Robert Duvall was just as brilliant as always. But obviously the biggest argument is, was this movie Brando's or Pachino's? Personally, I thought Brando was just incredible as always, and totally deserved the Oscar he turned down. Both nevertheless are unforgettable on screen.The pacing was impeccable, as well as the locations that are all shot beautifully. Some part of me does feel that the film is a bit too long, however a lot does happen and instantly captivates you enough to check out the sequels. The music was fantastic, helping bring the era and authenticity out of the picture and into the deepest parts of my brain. I could listen to the 'Love theme' all day. As said earlier, the movie is about the dynasty of the family, the business of the family and the vengeance of the family. So many themes are present and so much more are explored. Every gangster film ever made owes something to Francis Ford Coppola's efforts.Final Verdict: Probably the first modern gangster epic ever made. As director Stanley Kubrick said: 'Probably the finest cast ever assembled'. 10/10.",10,10,15,30 August 2014
