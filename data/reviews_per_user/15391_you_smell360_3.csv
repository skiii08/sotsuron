Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," enjoyable
","I watched this movie with my dad when I was in year 5. (I was as old as the character who plays Anakin, 10). This is still my favorite Star Wars movie (They are all good!) and it has the best light saber fight scene. (Actually its a toss up between Darth Maul vs Obi Wan and Anakin vs Darth Tyranus). Overall still a good movie. So far this is still my favorite Star Wars movie, but who knows? Maybe Revenge of the Sith will make this movie look like crap (and put all the other Star Wars movies to shame). It looks pretty good but so far this is still my favorite.This movie didn't feature many battle scenes, and could be slow in some parts, however it was still better than attack of the clones. And who could forget the pod racing scene? Awesome special effects for its time.",10,1,2,4 April 2005
Apocalypse Now," Stunning
","Last year at school, everyone was talking about this movie and everyone was saying how good it was so I had to see it. My friend burnt me it and I hated it, I thought it was boring. I was some what disenchanted after watching it expecting a really action packed movie. The first hour didn't disappoint but after that it was boring. I was only 15 then and I never really got over what a let down it was.So, for English I picked this film as a related text. This time I knew what to expect and this time I was really impressed and touched by the film. I think it had something with me being an age older. This time I actually listened to what they said and it made the story much more fascinating and bearable to watch, in fact it even moved quickly.The storyline of this film is very simple. Based on on the book Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, who has lost all hope in humanity is given the unenviable mission of traveling up the Nang river in order to bring the wayward Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando) under control. As the film progresses the viewer is confronted with numerous scenes raging from insanity to chaos, which not only shock, but make you reflect and sometimes even disturb you. An example is when they come to an outpost, the soldiers jump in the water screaming to be taken away from their perspective of hell. Another scene, is when Lance puts war paint on. When questioned about it he says 'they're everywhere', which is ludicrous when you think about it, because he is not in the jungle and could easy been picked off in the boat.Some of the films concepts are hard to be grasped and I wont go into them here. Suffice to say, it is better left for you to find out yourself. Apocalypse Now is sometimes said to be an inaccurate film about Vietnam and that films like Platoon are more accurate. That is not true though. The film accurately shows Vietnam, as a place literally gone mad. A war without any purpose other than the evil motivations of politics and the army. It is hard for the characters and the viewer to find hope in this film, because in Vietnam, there was none for the soldiers. This film is beautiful it really shows what the human mind is capable of, and if you can understand it, you will be changed forever by this powerful and moving film.Simply STUNNING",9,6,9,26 October 2005
The Incredibles," is this a joke?
","I saw this movie with my girlfriend a while ago. I thought it was pretty shocking. I can not believe such a crappy movie can get a better rating than beautiful movies such as Platoon and The Deer Hunter. Those movies actually have some meaning. This is just garbage.Apart from the animation which is, I have to admit fairly good, this movie is probably one of the worst I've seen. Not only is it incredibly boring (which is probably where it gets its name from) it glorifies violence. Killing people is seen as normal and to think little kids will be watching it, thats not a good thing for them. To make matters worse the plot is inconsistent. Also the film wasn't funny. I mean they made fun of Bob Parr's weight so many times that it just wasn't funny anymore. (Not that I personally thought anything in this film was funny). About 2 times in the entire movie, people actually laughed. So thats saying something about the humor content of this film. All in all it's an insult this made the IMDb top 250. Probably all the little kids came on here and gave it tens. Or the population enjoys being bored out of their mind watching a disjointed plot.In conclusion, if your a preteen thats been brainwashed by the media to love this, then I feel sorry for you but at least you have an excuse, you haven't been around very long and haven't had the opportunity to see many good films, yet. If your a(n) teen/adult who enjoyed this movie then your obviously an idiot who should simply grow up and actually watch some good films like Platoon or The Godfather.",1,23,76,10 April 2005
