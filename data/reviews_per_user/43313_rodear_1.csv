The Monuments Men," The lowest possible outcome for such a great cast.
","I didn't think it was possible to create a movie so bad with so many great stars. Trust me, this movie is just terrible. Never have I seen such lifeless performances from literally every person in a film. I have to blame the director as we know what Clooney and Blanchett and the others can do. The story has the potential for a great movie but it isn't brought to life in Monuments. At no point did I feel connected to the characters or the story. Why cast Bill Murray only to prevent him from delivering Murray antics in a film that could really use some life? It makes no sense. Clooney seemed asleep; I kept waiting for something to wake this film up; that never happened. Boring is the best way to describe it. Flat. I also had issue with the camera work. Many scenes seemed hurried having that home movie look. I wish they could remake the movie and tell it with some life and give us a reason to care. I'm sure the actual story is quite cool and worthy of telling.",2,1,1,21 August 2014
