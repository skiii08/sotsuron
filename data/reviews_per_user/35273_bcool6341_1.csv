The New World," Booorrrrrriiiiinnnnngggggg!
","This was one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long, long time. The 2+ hrs. of running time felt more like 3+. The cinematography is beautiful but the repetitious musical score just grated on my nerves. There is hardly any dialogue and when there was, it was hard to really understand what they were saying. If I had to watch one more scene of Pocahontas frolicking through a field with John Smith, I thought I was going to scream. Didn't they ever have to work?? And she sure seamed to learn English awfully quickly, what little bit was said. I thought the movie was finally going to start getting interesting once she married and went to visit England, could have been so much more to show. They just sort of breezed and rambled through the whole thing, once again with that annoying soundtrack blaring in the background. I didn't believe the chemistry for one second between the two leads. There was some with Christian Bale. But it became a joke when she and Bale began to also frolic through the fields. I'm sure the real Pocahontas was so much more interesting than this movie made her out to be. It was hard to get to know any of the Indians or really understand what they were all about. Was it just me or did there seem to be next to no women and children in the Indian camp? I would NOT recommend this film.",2,1,4,27 May 2006
