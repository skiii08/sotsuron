The Equalizer," Great movie
",I saw this on FX recently in preparation for seeing Equalizer 2 with my brand new MoviePass (here's to hoping MP is still around for years to come!). I loved Equalizer. It was action-packed and not boring at all. Highly recommend!,10,0,2,1 August 2018
A Star Is Born," Bradley Cooper - yum!
","Great movie and as much as I love Lady Gaga (check her out when she hosted Saturday Night Live - she was amazing), Bradley Cooper was absolutely drool worthy. Like I said - yum!",10,2,4,17 October 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Not as good as MI Ghost Protocol
",I found this movie to be boring compared to Ghost Protocol which I watched on FX right before this. The action scenes were boring too. I plan on seeing MI Fallout in a theater soon and hopefully that's better than this is.,5,1,2,1 August 2018
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Wow
","The special effects are amazing in this movie. I can't believe anyone in their right mind wouldn't like it, although I admit I'm not a Hobbit fan. This movie is incredible, not boring at all.",10,1,4,3 July 2018
The Lion King," Amazing!!
",I can't believe how realistic the animals look in this movie - it was truly incredible!,10,2,11,19 July 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," Masterpiece
",They don't make movies like this anymore. Amazing special effects especially since this was released in 1968. Run and see it in iMax while you can!,10,1,1,28 August 2018
Finding Dory," Great movie!
","This isn't really a review, just a message warning others to ignore the imbeciles that gave this movie a bad review.",10,0,1,6 September 2019
