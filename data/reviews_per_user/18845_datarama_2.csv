The Blair Witch Project," The most terrifying movie I've ever seen
","Wow, this was absolutely terrifying! I haven't felt fear like this since I saw Night Of The Living Dead as a ten-year-old. Be sure and buy a night-light before watching this one, because you'll never sleep in the dark again! I'm still reeling from those haunting image and sounds.  Brilliant, unprecedented filmmaking.",10,2,5,15 March 1999
Cloverfield," Boring and lame
","Didn't care about any of the characters (I was glad to see them die off), found the contrived shaky Blair Witch camera style absolutely annoying--and there's no story whatsoever. Plot holes everywhere and no attempts at even the most simple explanations. If you like shameless product placement, low-resolution special effects, and the prose of a 6th-grader, you might not want to off yourself in the theater. The whole thing is shot to look like an amateur video (the film's only real success), so 50% of the movie is shots of walls, floors, and blur. Tries to rip off Godzilla and Alien with nothing new. Terrible! Rent Gwoemul (2006) instead.",1,38,99,19 January 2008
