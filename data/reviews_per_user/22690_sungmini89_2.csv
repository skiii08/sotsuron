Come and See," general thought of this movie,,,
","This film, personally for me, while watching, got me frustrated in general. Frankly because I had no control over what was happening while the movie was going on, especially, when the German Nazi soldiers were almost harassing the Russian civilians. This film in general made me really despise the Nazis more than any other films that I've seen that has to do with the Nazis. The movie had very realistic camera angle, as well as the story line. It generally gave me an idea of how much people went through during the times of World War II. My favorite part of the movie was the very last scene, where the Russian soldiers were marching on to fight against the Nazis; it generally gave the audience hope as to what's going to happen; also, when the main character steps into the crowd of the other soldiers, it reminded of the ending from the 'Bicycle Thief' because it felt like he just moved in and disappeared into the crowd. The little hope at the very end of the movie, really, watching the horror for about 2 hours, gave me a real hope at the end.",7,2,3,14 December 2007
Ran," use of colors in the plot
","One thing that really stayed with me after watching this film was the 'colorfulness' of the movie. Just in general, everything was so colorful; seems as though, the director, Kurosawa, concentrated a lot while he was filming the movie. The expression of the blood was very interesting; it seemed very fake (compared to the movies nowadays), but it still had a great effect to the audience with the bright red color. He also used the color to almost distinguish the sons in the movies; yellow, red, and blue. While watching, I thought Kurosawa expressed himself in couple different characters; one would be Hidetora, who is so majestic in the beginning in the movie but eventually referred as an old senile fool who can't even take care of himself. It seems as though he represented his career throughout the years, and how he must have felt throughout the years. Especially, when he expressed how pathetic Heditora felt when he couldn't even kill himself; just as how he tried to commit suicide but he fails. This film was a representation, from my point of view, of his career, as well as his life before he produced the film.",7,0,2,14 December 2007
