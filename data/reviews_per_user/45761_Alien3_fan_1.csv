Alien 3," well acted. well directed. disrespected.
",When watching this film understand that life is not happy and especially not life in a horror film. The story is about the perils of Ripley and all of her suffering caused by the Alien. This is a woman who hasn't gotten peace since she first encountered the beast. She saw one little sliver of light (newt) in a dark tunnel and then the light was taken from her. All of her pain and suffering combined with her nature to protect makes the finale of this movie even more classic.This movie is the fitting end for the series and is on par with the first two installments in every single way.,10,2,6,1 July 2004
