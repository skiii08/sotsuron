Raiders of the Lost Ark," It belongs on your DVD shelf!
","When that bullwhip first cracked across the screen, everyone wanted to be like Indiana Jones. To have the adventures, the women and the fights. But until then, I guess we all will have to make do with this the first of the trilogy (though second in chronological order.) The first time i saw this, was 1988. BBC1 showed it uncut for the first time. This might spoil the ending but I didn't like the bit with the faces.(I was only six!) Then, I started to like it. Then, I started to love it. The DVD boxset is worth it though. Remastered for a new generation of fans, The movie is still reguarded as one of the best films of all time alongside star wars and the godfather. But in my eyes, it will always be THE best film of all time with its special effects, witty one-liners and a hero to really be proud of, this really deserves to be your next purchase!",9,0,0,25 March 2004
Shaun of the Dead," One Gory Story
","'Flesh....Brains....Trousers!' Well, maybe not the last one but Zombies always seem to be after the same thing: Food. I mean, don't they ever want employment? Money? Well...no. They don't actually. Because Zombies have been shuffling in to our cinemas for over fourty years (so, they should be paid, damnit!), starting off with George A. Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' which, sorry George, I didn't like. For me, it was too slow (I know Zombies don't run!) and it got boring. But Shaun Of The Dead...it's a different story altogether! It's fast, funny as hell and can actually get you moved (one part in perticular which I will not mention. You'll have to find out for yourself!). 29 year-old Shaun works 9-5 in an electric appliance shop. One day, after deciding that the most romantic place to take your girlfriend out to is the Winchester, she decides to dump him. However the day after, all is not what it seems as the undead stumble about, fall in to his garden and gets photographed by one of his best mates called Ed. Who else can use records to try and get rid of the undead? Maybe he should have tryed a bit of Des O'Conner. That would have shifted 'em! Simon Pegg is great in his first major starring role as the anti-hero Shaun. But it's his best mate Ed (played brillliantly by Nick Frost) that steals the show. His quips and suggestions just come out of the blue! I won't give too much away. Just that shuffle along to the cinema, get a big bucket o' popcorn and get ready for the funniest hour and fourty minutes of your (undead)life! This is an excellent alternative to the other zombie movies out there but I will say this: is ISN'T as gory as the other movies!",8,0,1,11 May 2004
BASEketball," Laughed so much it hurts!!
","If you love The Naked Gun movies, the Airplane movies, Top Secret! and South Park, you will LOVE this. I laughed so much, my ears popped! Two guys invent a brand new sport that sweeps the nation. 'Nuff said! The film is directed by the king of these kind of movies: David Zucker. It even has eye candy in the form of Jenny McCarthy and Yasmeen Bleeth. Its as crazy as Airplane! As insane as The Naked Gun! As Stupid as...as....making mashed potato with your bum! Even though its only on for 90-minutes, the constant ribbing of Squeak Scholari by Trey Parker and Matt Stone is funny on its own. Yes, its rude. And yes, its crude. But...its only a bit of fun and not meant to be taken seriously!!",10,5,10,25 March 2004
Face_Off," I want to take his face.....off!
","John Woo. How you have made us happy. With Mission: Impossible II, Broken Arrow, Paycheck and this, his best effort, FACE/OFF. Everything is here: diabolical villains, lovable heroes, pulsepounding situations and his trademark: two-gun diving tomfoolery with white doves. Granted, it does get a bit confusing when trying to explain to someone who hasn't seen it, but just tell them to watch. The best two hours of my life. John Travolta plays a damn good cop and a damn good villain. Mind you, the same can be said for Nicolas Cage. They play each other excellently. The surgery scene is a bit gross but the way they get Nicolas Cage to sound like John Travolta is amazing.",8,0,1,11 May 2004
The Evil Dead," If you go down to the woods today....leggit!
","Its better than Dawn Of The Dead, not quite as good as Evil Dead 2 but is good in its own right. Story is: Five friend go to cabin. Find Book and tape recorder. Release spirits (Jack daniels and vodka, please!). Carnage, dead things and strangness ensues. When I first saw it, it ran for Eighty minutes and had the good stuff cut. Bugger! So, bought the DVD, good stuff back in equals RESULT! I can't really understand why the BBFC cut most of it. The effects, good back then, are lame.The actings a bit suspect but strangly....it works! And did you know there was a game of The Evil Dead released for thr Sinclair Spectrum waaaay back in 1983 that also got banned. Just for going round and carving up already dead people. Blumming silly! At the end of the day its only a movie. And no harm ever came of reading a book. Ooo, whats this book? Necromicon, eh? Berius Arter Necting...........JoIN uS!!!",7,1,2,25 March 2004
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," You Silly so-called Atheur King!
","Where to begin. I could qoute a sketch or even a funny line. But I won't. Instead, I'll Leave it to The Python team. First released waaaaay back in 1975 when Do-gooders banned Death Race 2000 (acting so crap it was good!), We brits released this little gem. Now some people don't like Monty Python, but I love it. And this film just sits at number two with Life of Brian being better. Telling the story of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table, they set off on a quest to find the holy grail while on the way confronting the Black Knight who won't give in, The Killer Rabbit, The Black Beast Of AAARRRGGGHH, and others.There are some very funny moments like the french taunting (silly knn-ig-its!!), the Castle Anthrax and Sir Bedeviere's theory on the Earth being Banana shaped! And not a tin of spam or singing viking in sight!!",10,1,2,25 March 2004
