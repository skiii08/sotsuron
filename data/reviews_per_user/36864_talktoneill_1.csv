Skyfall," Way Way over-hyped...
","Someone said to me 2 weeks ago just before Skyfall came out, 'Is it just me or is this the most hyped and over-marketed Bond of all time?' I hadn't really thought about it, but once it was pointed out, I realised that for about 2 months before the release, you couldn't move for the billboards, bus-side ads, TV and radio spots, over-hyped theme song etc etc. I concluded it must be partly because it's the 50th anniversary, but I always worry when a film is this over-hyped, because it's very very difficult to meet expectations this high. Also, there's a danger people will have decided they love the movie before they even see it, and I think that's what's happened here. It's the Emperor's New Clothes. This is an average movie, at best.There are so many reasons why this doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Dr No, Goldeneye or Casino Royale, I'll just mention a few:<ul><li>Ridiculous Villain with a ridiculous plan: Are we expected to believe that this guy can put together a team of world class elite mercenaries, set up the most advanced cyber-terrorism organisation in the world, and all he wants to use it for is to kill his ex boss? It's just a limp, implausible plan.</li></ul><ul><li>Major Plot Holes: As already mentioned by other users here, there's just so much that doesn't stack. Silva's whole plan is based around letting himself get caught, knowing where he'll be imprisoned, and knowing how to get from there to where M will be at that time? Surely if he can hack into any system in the world, including triggering a gas explosion in M's office, he could just arrange to break into her house at some point? Also, he's managed to plant explosives in the tunnels below the Underground, right at the point where Bond will be standing, at exactly the moment a train is passing overhead, and he did this years in advance? (minor point, that train was completely empty of people. Just lazy direction)</li></ul>Quote (approximately anyway): 'This guy is a ghost. Nobody knows anything about him; his real name or where he's from..... But we do know he'll be flying to shanghai in 2 days on flight 235 landing at 21.00'. I mean come on.<ul><li>The Agents List: Did Silva actually steal this? If so, why? Just to get M and Bond's attention? And once he's started releasing the names, does he stop? Clumsy plot line.</li></ul><ul><li>Komodo Dragons. Enough said.</li></ul>I'm not saying this is a bad film. It's beautifully shot, has some decent action sequences, and explores new and interesting sides to a very well known character. But there's far too many problems with it up there with the best Bonds, or to put it in IMDb's top 250.",5,176,333,4 November 2012
