Requiem for a Dream," Best movie of all time? .................. Maybe.
","Context of my opinion: I am 33 years old, Brazilian physician, movie addict. My top movies are 2001: Space Odyssey, The Matrix, Shawshank Redemption, City of God. Among theses movies, I set Requiem for a Dream.There's to much to say, but the movie shows it prominence on its own.There's no flaws, no second views, no subtle information, no blurred plot. Everything is clear and precise. The movie doesn't lay over the pseudo intellectualism. No other movie depict the human mind fragility so well. We are addict to television, drugs, medicines, status, and others values of modern society.The union, synchronization, marriage between frames and sound is perfect. Yes, PERFECT. The music is a masterpiece.Arronofski had such control of his picture that he knew that audience were gone destroyed (in good sense) at the end, so the credits rolling in silence (almost)... like a time to recover the breath.This picture is a life changing.Among the 5 best movie of all time. Simple like that.",10,2,4,24 January 2011
Pearl Harbor," Worst movie of all time
","I have a doubt: Pearl Harbor is the worst movie of all time? Transformers 2 is the worst ever? I don't know. What I know for sure is that Michael Bay has a problem: He is an amateur playing with huge budgets.There's no much to say, because this movie is a complete mess in all levels. In fact, I recommend cinema students to watch this movie, so they will know what NOT to do. What most I disgust this movie is the complete mediocrity of the director to understand what makes a movie a good experience. I really don't understand why a guy that doesn't know that is working in cinema industry. A very bad movie.",1,4,6,24 January 2011
Avengers: Endgame," Fun conclusion, but overuse of Deus Ex-Machina
","Not as bright as everybody saying, Endgame is full of plot holes, and for plot hole I mean holes in their own rules. I accept every kind of belief suspension - Superman flying, time travel in Back to the Future, sounds of explosions in Star Wars. But I can't accept Superman with telecinetic powers for convenience, Midiclorians, or the convoluted timeline in Terminator Genesys. Moviemakers cannot break their own game rules. Furthermore, time travel is a danger way to go in movies, afterall, in next Marvel phase nothing that happens will be a real concert once there will be this solution under the table.This movie is very satisfying...once you turn off your brain.But....Acting is top notch.
Comedy is top notch.
There are some surprises and unpredictable moves.
Thor is hilarious (for me the best part of this entire universe).
Characters are coerent with their values (unlike Snyder's Superman)Better than Avatar (most near comparable blockbuster)? Hmmm........ not.",8,0,1,27 April 2019
City of God," Among the 5 best movies of all time
","This movie is sure amazing. If it was a American movie, probably would receive higher rater here in IMDb. I fact, I am surprise the a foreign language movie receive so good reviews, because watch this movie in original language (I am Brazilian) is so much more involving than the dubbed version. The language itself plays a role, because there are a peculiar way of expression that the characters uses. Is sad to say that the power of words is lost in translation.Anyway, this movie is among the 5 best movies of all time. I live in Brazil, I know what I talking: it's is not fiction. Rio de Janeiro has a real problem of poverty, crime and drugs, as showed in the movie (the movie real history happened some 30 years ago.Fernando Meirelles, the director, is very nice guy, very humble e gifted.This is not a exploitation movie as some haters say. Unfortunately, it is real. If not, I would agree that there's a lot of violence on screen, but wait... there's a huge distance between the fetishism of violence and the exposure of a real problem.But above all the violence exposed, there's a felling of hope carried by the main character. Besides all the context of poverty that surrounds him, he not engaged to crime. Well, watch the movie...A courageous, strong e very well done movie.",10,1,3,24 January 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Worst movie of all time - no exaggeration
","I am 33 years old, I've watch every film release in the past 30 years (at least the mainstream movies) and I have no doubt that this is the worst piece of crap I ever attendant. Before this, my personal bottom movie was Pearl Harbor. Michael Bay has break his record of crap again. It's incomprehensible how a huge crew cannot see the iceberg coming to collide with this Titanic mess. I can't explain too how a great director like Steve Spilberg went aboard this sinking ship. Just for the money, maybe. But for the money he could produce a better movie, like he used to do. Anyway, this movie have no brain. Don't tell me this is a action flick! The jokes are an embarrassment for the actors and audience. The camera work is a headache tour. The plot have no sense at all. It is just confusion, explosions, camera shakes, stupid lines, merchandising...I will no lie: never I abandoned a movie before the end. This too. But I don't remember a movie that I want never watch again one scene at least... This is the case. Michael Bay is a amateur playing with huge budgets. Why people continues to give him money is beyond our imagination...",1,2,10,24 January 2011
Rosemary's Baby," Terror for adults. Stay away if you like Michael Bay
","This movie is a masterpiece. I haven't watched it til 2020. Now, due this quarantine I get the time and really confirm all the hype. Its a masterclass of how to make a movie.There are no jump scares, not loud noises. Just believable actors, intelligent screenplay and a director that respect the audience's intellect.",10,2,3,19 April 2020
It Chapter Two," Above the average
","It's not perfect, there is a lot of CGI, but there are some scenes that invert expectations and are worth it. The adult cast is excellent, everyone is the mature version of children. What I like most is the feel of the 80s, the good cinematography, the Poltergeist tone, the classic style. Much better than those shaky cameras.",8,0,2,31 March 2020
Inception," Good movie, but very overrated
","One is a rate to balance properly the fanatic reviews here. This is a good movie. But is impossible that this movie flies above from the source: The Matrix. Inception is a rip-off and comes 10 years late for a chance to be consider original. Well, that's it. Good soundtrack,good cinematography, but none original. The effects are pretty good, but not jaw dropping. The plot is just complex, but not intelligent .Nolan has not been nominee for Academy Award and that is fair. If the Watchoski was not too, why should be Nolan? I recommend people to watch this movie. But I recommend those people don't surf the hype. Otherwise they will be catch in Nolan's marketing.",1,10,18,26 January 2011
Mad Max: Fury Road," A master class of how to made a movie entertaining
","There's no way to give less than 10 stars. If I would do that, I would be unfair, because movies are getting hard to made as almost all stories had been told before, in all imaginable ways . So, when you watch, in 2015, a movie that made you feel some heart pounding, and that movie made you enter a new, believable, stylish, amazing, surreal, barbarian but beautiful world, you have to surrender. I didn't felling that for some time, I would say.It's a kind of Indiana Jones, Star Wars mixed up with the best of Road Warrior.I am amazed by how some people are complaining that there's little dialog, because it's part of the beauty. It is a painted picture, a story told by images. And there's a lot of subtext over the images. I like Mel Gibson as actor and director. But the new guy has the sight, the 'madness', the biotype of Max. What I feel more happy is for George Miller. The man fought against the odds to bring this to the screen. Some time ago, this movie was destiny to fail. And now, the reviews put it into classic status. Well, this is not a broad audience movie. I recommend if you are fan of Robocop, Mad Max, Conan the barbarian, Heavy Metal, cars, adventure.Now the film is a cult, I just want not to wait many years to see the next.",10,4,15,17 May 2015
