Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino Tantalised Everybody's Tastebuds.
","A bit slow at the start of the movie but it is all forgiven in the last half hour. The bits in between were great, I enjoyed the old movie setting in some parts. The action sequence at the end of the film was fantastic, Tarantino really knows his fight scenes and this was no exception. In conclusion: movie good hippy bad.",9,1,2,29 March 2020
Rango," A Uniquely Creative Western Movie
","I first watched this movie as a child in 2012, upon my second viewing I can properly appreciate all that Rango has to offer. It is really a homage to old western films, a new take on them if you will. It is especially fun to notice that some of the scenes in the movie reference other films such as Star Wars. Worth a watch.",9,0,0,7 March 2020
Fantastic Mr. Fox," It Deserves all the Praise it Gets.
","This is a truly 'Fantastic' film and does deserve all the praise it gets, the meticulous hours of work that must of gone into this has fully paid off in this 1hr and 28min picture. Everything from the colours to the humor is well thought out. Highly recommend.",10,0,0,24 March 2020
Lucy," Pretty Cool Sequences in the Film
","I enjoyed the film for the most part, had some complaints about some of the science however this is a sci-fi movie. Some of the sequences were very well done especially near the end of the film.",7,9,13,5 March 2020
