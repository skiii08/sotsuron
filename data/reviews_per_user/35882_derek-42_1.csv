The Blair Witch Project," Scary as hell.
","Where do we go from here in the horror genre?  Psychological and emotional manipulation, that's where.  The Blair Witch Project concentrated all of it's efforts to do one thing: make the audience feel scared.  While it fits perfectly within the time line of popular media -- video: Cops, Real World, America's Scariest Home Video's -- it still exhibits the professionalism that a well thought out story does.  It is a one-up on the ultimate campfire campfire story.  Undoubtedly more frightening than The Haunting, The Blair Witch Project is a revolution in filmmaking.  It is a sign of the times. We want to be scared, Alfred Hitchcock style.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
