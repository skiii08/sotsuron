Ali," If you like to see Will Smith's head in a close-up shot....
","This movie was moving in the right direction but i didn't quite find a track.  Will Smith plays Ali, the people's champion.  I thought it was a good performance.  I never really knew what Ali was really like until i saw this movie.  (I was born in the mid 80's).  But the thing that disturbed me the most was the director Michael Mann had like most shots of everybody in the movie as a close-up shot.  Like really close.  A lot of the time you couldn't see the scenery and anything else in a room because most of the shots were all close up.   Another thing is that this movie drags.  So much could be edited out.  Anyway it was alright despite what i just said.  Go see it but don't buy it.",Null,0,0,7 January 2002
