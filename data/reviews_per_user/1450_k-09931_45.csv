Your Name.," I love it
","This movie has so much warmth. At the start you think, okay it's a little intriguing. Then it becomes entertaining and you're like okay let's see where it goes. And then, as it goes, you're thanking the past-you who decided to watch it. And in the end, you're sad that it ended.",8,0,1,19 March 2020
Fight Club," A brutal film about capitalism with two incredible leads.
","This suspense movie was really good. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and the rest of the cast did an excellent job in this movie. The plot to the movie was very dramatic and suspenseful. You'll be shocked to see what happens near the end. I would definitely recommend this movie. It's a must see.",8,0,1,24 March 2020

",If someone asked me what is my favorite movie of all time. This is the movie that is immediately on my mind.,10,1,1,16 March 2020
The Godfather: Part II," The best movies about italian Mafia, perfect Trilogy.
","Perhaps even grander than its predecessor, Part II throws us and Michael into the lion's den, continuing the Greek tragedy in the most potent, gripping way.",9,0,0,24 March 2020
LÃ©on: The Professional," Tough hard hitting movie. Brutal but touchingly soft.
","I really enjoyed this film the first time I saw it and it seems to improve every time I rewatch. It's very well put together with great characters and storyline. It's got a great atmosphere and it's great at building tension. Jean Reno is perfectly cast as Leon and this is definitely his best role. The same can be said for Natalie Portman, as far as I'm concerned this is still her best role. As always Gary Oldman is on top form and showcases what a fantastic actor he is in every part he plays.",9,0,1,27 March 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Absolutely enchanting. A must watch classic.
","Fanatstic construction of a complex fantasy universe that lends itself as much to beginners as it does to fans of the novels.
i cant find one bad thing about this movie. everything is just fantastic the music the plot the characters everything is perfect",9,1,1,24 March 2020
American Beauty," A film with great acting and a great story.
",A wonderful pealing away of the veneer of life in middle class America and its decent in chaos. A great script and direction along side some strong acting performances make for a truly great film.,8,1,1,30 March 2020
In the Name of the Father," Fantastic storyline. Infuriating outcome.
","A great story that show us how the police and the law can be the worst nightmare for innocent people when they are driven by political issues and stereotypes about nationalities, races, religion, etc. Daniel Day Lewis' performance is remarkable.",8,0,0,21 March 2020
Toy Story 4," Very sad at time but also very funny
","Enjoyable, familiar characters, and a simple plot. Same formula and pacing of the other movies... Teamwork, evolving, closure...",7,0,0,1 April 2020
The Pianist," Powerful movie about survival and the duality of man
","I like seeing this side of WWII, when the Jewish people we're still going about there business right before everything went to hell. It's almost impossible and inhuman the way these Nazi's treated the Jewish people, almost as if they we're animals. That dancing scene was degrading. I love the way Polanski tackles this topic. It's almost like when you become used to the chaos like the dead body on the side of the pavement and everyone just kind of weaves around without thinking too much about the fact that it's a dead body since they're so used to it. He does an amazing job at painting it like a living nightmare. One in which everyone has learned to live in. As brutal and bleak as this movie is, Polanski always finds ways to sneak in a laugh or two and I love it. His approach is pretty cynical to the whole thing. I mean being in a situation like that, what else can you feel? Amazing movie filled with emotion and depth.",8,0,0,23 March 2020
Aladdin," An amusing movie with all the great songs you wish.
","I was as skeptical as many others because I adore the original. Then this remake kicked into gear and I was smitten! Guy Ritchie didn't disappoint me with this beautiful film. I thought Will Smith sparkled as the Genie, and I feel many people were overly harsh with their criticism of his performance. This film was fun, and stayed true to the heart of the original.",8,0,0,28 March 2020
Frozen," fun, good songs, nice message, great animation. great for kids.
","Very nice animations and a very good storyline. You really feel like you are a part of this Scandinavian snow-world. The characters are a bit neutral, however the great animations make up for that.",8,1,2,1 April 2020
Good Will Hunting," Best movie I've ever watched. It's a master piece.
","Performance delivery that does the thoroughly-planned and meticulous screen writing justice. The narrative captures the struggles of morality, relationships and mental health, as the movie follows the development of an inert young man. An amazing exploration of society's demands and their effects on how we view people to shape the world. A must see.",8,1,1,31 March 2020
Room," Was emotional and beautiful
","The film is boring at first, but then it becomes compelling and in the end it was pleasant to see.",8,0,0,20 March 2020
Schindler's List," A powerful and deep story.
",The way this movie depicts the horrors of what the holocaust was like is amazing with great performances the whole way through. Shows the change in a man and what he thinks is right.,9,0,1,26 March 2020
Coco," I fell in love with Latin American culture
",Great film! Loved learning about the Latino culture! Music was fabulous! Animation was spot on! Watching this film made me feel all sort of emotions! Well done Pixar for making a Latino film!,9,0,0,18 March 2020
1917," The music and cinematography is spectacular and beautiful. Emotional and deep movie.
",One of the most unique films I've ever seen which is a compliment it's so hard for a war movie to stand out from the rest. The best cinematography I have ever seen and it rightfully earned an oscar for it. Amazing performances by every actor. Very tense and keeps you biting your nails on the edge of your seat. A must watch.,8,1,4,29 March 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," bloody but also an amazing movie
","I feel Kill Bill is where Tarantino is most allowed to be himself. Tarantino's that one 'cool' director that most people like. He's got style, he's got flair, and that's really what Kill Bill is- all the style and flair of a Tarantino film turned up to eleven.",7,0,0,20 March 2020
The Dark Knight," A great movie
","Whilst it has it's problems, the Dark knight remains probably one of the best superhero movies ever made, maybe even one of the best films ever made. 12 years on and we're still debating who the real hero was and what every last line meant. Intricate, clever, perfectly paced and with an absolute standout performance from Heath Ledger. The universal praise is all fully deserved.",9,0,0,18 March 2020
Toy Story," Timeless childhood classic
",An excellent story with interesting characters and great writing make this a must watch animated film.,9,0,0,23 March 2020
Alice in Wonderland," I like this Alice
","I like this Alice, she is strong, smart, modern, with her own ideas. She was an inspirational young girl, an early feminist. I want girls to see themselves in her. By the way, I love the pictures in this movie very much.",7,0,0,15 March 2020
3 Idiots," Smart, touching and funny movie. Really enjoyed it.
","If someone ask me what is my top 3 favourite movies,this will be one of them. comedy,romance,friendship,motivation,hope,dreams,future. this has taught me a lot about being a student and about life.",9,0,0,25 March 2020
Life Is Beautiful," Life is beautiful
","Life is Beautiful. I have yet to meet someone not touched by it's romance, it's sweetness, selflessness and consequently it's horror, and I'd be very surprised if I ever did. Roberto Benigni paints the beautiful picture of a father who, though he is aware of reality, builds a fantasy around his son so that he might not have to suffer as he suffers, and also in order to save his life. Though it is important to live in reality, there are times where it is unnecessary, or it can even be healthy to escape it. The character he portrayed was so lovable, and his antics make for a very romantic and comedic story to lead into the rest of the movie.",10,0,0,17 March 2020
Beauty and the Beast," The remake doesn't have to be exactly the same
","A nice retelling of the classic Disney animated film. I think the gripes that many people have with it boils down to them inevitably comparing it with its predecessor. Yes, it does some things differently, which is a good thing. Who wants to see a shot-for-shot remake? Not saying it has no flaws, but I think many complaints are just nitpicking from fans who can't separate the two films.",7,0,0,22 March 2020
Pulp Fiction," Amazing, hilarious, and dark
","This is an absolutely amazing film. Great story. Great characters. The layout of the film is truly amazing and goes against the classical 3 stage story, almost as if it is 4 short films with multiple separate protagonists and antagonists. It breaks the norm of movie story telling and that's why it is so highly renowned in the movie industry. Definitely would recommend.",10,1,2,26 March 2020
The Shape of Water," A well done love story between a mute woman and an underwater creature.
",This movie was nothing less than a thrilling drama movie and I was totally onboard until the story took a turn from human - pet love to a more romance. I see what the director was going for but these beats just don't land with me and I find this aspect of the film rather disturbing.,8,0,6,23 March 2020
It's a Wonderful Life," Classic, as entertaining today as it was decades ago.
","Perfect all the way. Tons of history, great acting and a heart warming message. All of us have an opportunity to live a life, which affects many. Live a good life no matter what hand you're dealt and you will be remembered well.",9,0,0,27 March 2020
Psycho," I'm usually not a huge fan of classic horror films such as this, but this one is obviously pretty good.
","It's interesting to see this movie classic who, by many opinions, have helped form the horror genre. It was better than some of today's movies, because it doesn't have all those modern horror cliches, like 'the evil' and girls with long dark hair in white dresses.",8,0,0,29 March 2020
Joker," Really frightening but amazing character study of a legendary villain.
",Phoenix makes a Good Joker. I say Good because the Film in itself could of been better. The Story and Plot could of done more to pull you in with interest. All and all good and entertaining,7,1,1,22 March 2020
Whiplash," Just my favorite movie here. Love the acting and everything about it is great.
","Easily one of the greatest movies of the decade. Amazing plot, interesting and complex characters, flawless acting and memorable scenes. And the way that it respects music is just fantastic. The only issue that I have with it, is the fact that it doesn't really focus on the side characters (take Andrew's family as an example). But this issue is so small compared to the good things of the movie, that you don't even think about it. A really amazing masterpiece that I highly recommend.",9,0,0,31 March 2020
The Green Mile," This movie can make you cry, laugh and feel scared at the same time.
","A brilliant and inventive story of friendship, combined with Darabont's direction and script, the performances of the cast, Newman's score, Tattersall's cinematography, Francis-Bruce's editing, Marsh's production design, Seirton's set decoration, Wagner's costume design, action sequences and visual effects, The Green Mile is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King work!!!",9,0,0,30 March 2020
The Lion King," My number 1 favorite Disney movie of all time
","This is the Greatest Movie I have ever seen, the Animation is Stunning, the Songs are Beautifully Sung with Well Done Lyrics, The Story is Well Written with a lot of Heart and Soul and has a Very Encouraging Moral and It has some of the Most Lovable, Well Made and Relatable Characters I have ever seen, There is Literally without a doubt, nothing wrong with the Film, it is in My Opinion Absolutely Perfect, If you haven't seen, Go Check it out it is Definitely Worth a Watch.",10,0,0,20 March 2020
Inception," Really deep and confusing probably a rewatch but definitely not bad
","Great cast, so much fun to watch and rewatch. Trying to figure out the movie with your friends and checking out the many online theories was a great memorable experience. And it tells you how deep the movie goes, making you uncertain of what you see is somehow real... or if it was all a dream.",9,1,2,28 March 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Fantastic movie.
",Fantastic movie. One of the best 90s movies I've seen. Everything about this movie from plot to character development is solid. The ending wraps the story up in a meaningful and memorable way. There is a reason why this movie continues to be referenced time and time again.,10,0,0,16 March 2020
Parasite," Super big plot twist. Almost an entirely different movie in the second half of the movie. Amazing !
","Parasite is an instant all time classic. Like 'Breaking Bad' it is pretty much perfect in every way...script, casting, lighting, locations, makeup and hair, music. Will be all all time great lists for years to come. Most important, a movie like this helps the world get over itself as far as fear of subtitles is concerned. Think of the GREAT movies that will be opened up for the great American movie-loving public once they learn to tolerate subs! Perfect movie-making, it's a rare treat...enjoy!",8,0,1,25 March 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," A good horror movie
",Truly one of the most chllingest and unsettlingly movies ever to be made!,9,0,0,18 March 2020
Toy Story 3," I love the emotion in this movie
","Got to feel that I've really grown with the toys and Andy that I literally cried in the cinema. Third of the Toy Story films, it captured a whole new issue about growing up without simply being a repeat of its predecessors. It gave the Toy Story world so much more depth, and extended its reach without dragging or over-stretching it.",9,0,0,21 March 2020
AmÃ©lie," Beautiful,prefect film
","I cannot believe I had never seen this beautiful, charming and absolutely heart-filling film. It was amazingly well written with a keen eye for life and all its idiosyncrasies. It was engaging and fun and innovative when it needed to be. The camera work was playful and the acting was fantastic. What a breath of fresh air!",10,0,0,19 March 2020
Rear Window," Brilliant, involving, visually captivating, perfectly staged. The quintessence of suspence
",Rear Window: A classic Hitchcock masterpeice that slowly builds from start to finsih in thrilling form.,9,2,2,30 March 2020
Heat," A great heist movie.
","An epic crime drama pitting two of the greats on opposite sides of the law. Pacino and DeNiro square off against each other and although they only share a few scenes together, they electrify. Featuring a stellar supporting cast, dynamic city scapes, and to date, one of the greatest bank robbery scenes ever filmed. Although long, it never wavers and is an exciting watch from start to finish.",8,0,0,31 March 2020
Back to the Future," A quality classic film that everyone must watch at least once.
","An amazing movie with great set ups for stuff we will explore in the 'Past' yet it does feel like the ending drags on, when it could have ended more smoothly. Grade: A",9,0,0,29 March 2020
The Godfather," I love it
","The Godfather is excellent Melo drama of crime film. About family, social, personal of our self about what should we do for protect the family and bring a punishment for bad people, and we also must teach a bad people with kindness not with violence.",9,0,0,17 March 2020
