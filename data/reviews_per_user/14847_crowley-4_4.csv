The Ring," It made my skin crawl
","I've been wanting to watch this one for the last few years but my wife refused to let me buy a copy of the DVD (of the Japanese version) as she said 'I don't want that film in the house'. Anyway, I finally taped a modified version of the American movie from HBO and watched it during the day with the curtains open. My hair stood on end and I had to take two breaks but I got through it.It is a very harrowing and clever film - and don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it by saying more. Previously I thought 'Halloween' (the first one) was the creepiest film ever (the music is still haunting) but this film is a masterpiece - scarier than 'The Sixth Sense' but similarly unnerving and deserving of a repeat viewing. I compare it to 'Seven' for shock value and style.Now I have to summon up the courage to watch the Japanese version.",9,1,1,11 July 2004
Pacific Rim," Visually spectacular with terrible script and acting
","I watched this on DVD at home. Too bad I didn't see it in 3D in a cinema as the visuals are spectacular. Big monsters fighting big robots in Hong Kong and under the sea - what's not to like if you were ever a young boy!The script was the worst I have heard in recent memory. I know Idris Elba can act (eg. The Wire) but in this movie he bears a constant pained expression which reflects the dire situation his character is in, and perhaps his regret at having accepted a role of any sort in such a film.Given the focus on realistic graphics (monsters, robots, water effects, cities being demolished, etc.), it's disappointing that the producers didn't feel it necessary to have the human characters behave or talk like real humans.This film teaches our children once again that when faced with something inexplicable and dangerous, scientists are weirdos who can't be trusted, while aggression, weaponry and self-confidence will ensure victory. It's a thoroughly 'American' film, which reflects the country's gun culture and jingoism in today's news stories.My 11 year old son enjoyed it. I just hope he doesn't take it to heart.",4,2,3,27 September 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Great fun! I hope my memory fails so I can enjoy it all over again.
","I saw this in a big modern cinema in Melbourne and the sound was amazing. There were moments when my seat trembled so I hope you get to see it in a good theatre too.The film followed the book pretty closely, leaving out some singing (thank goodness), some Frodo-Sam moments (a shame) and the whole Saruman-in-the-Shire bit. The undead army storyline differed from the book but improved upon it, but the victory celebrations were a little weak, considering the 10 hours or so of conflict.My main criticism is with the blue screen night scenes where the actors were overlit. A small quibble in what is otherwise an exhilarating end to the trilogy.",9,1,2,10 January 2004
Godzilla," What a waste of time and talent
","I should say at the outset that I am 43 years old so not exactly the target market for this film.I felt sorry for Ken Watanabe whose scenes involved furrowing his brow and mumbling nonsense about the power of nature. I also felt sorry for David Strathairn - a good actor who had nothing to do in his scenes as an admiral.Well done to all those involved in the making of this film who earned money from it, and congratulations to the special effect wizards who brought the creatures to life. I love seeing 'believable' massive creatures on screen, having grown up in the era of 'men in suit' and stop-motion monsters.But I don't enjoy watching films that glorify the (usually American) military machine, and those that make a mockery of science (Prometheus, Independence Day, etc.). This film does both, while the script is the worst I have heard since 'Predators'. I didn't care about the characters or feel there was much excitement, and left the cinema feeling that no one has really done a scary monster story properly since Alien.",4,1,4,31 May 2014
