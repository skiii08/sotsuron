Despicable Me 2," Besides a string of jokes, both adult and juvenile, the best moments in Despicable me 2 are when we get to see minions indulge in screwball mischief.
","Whenever a sequel is announced, it is safe to assume that filmmakers are coming after your money in an attempt to milk the success of the original film. From a movie patron's perspective, there is always a risk of being victimized should pre-ordained expectations go south. This risk is amplified when returning viewers expect an equal or greater experience in comparison. While not quite as unique as the 2010 original, I am happy to report that Despicable Me 2 is an equally entertaining encore, just as long as your expectations are tethered to a stick of Acme dynamite. Yes; dynamite.Returning directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud have brought along few tricks that are seamlessly blended into the visual quality of this animation. And of course, the use of 3D is one of them. That being said, the real treats come from returning screenwriters Ken Daurio and Cino Paul, by injecting the story with heavy doses of the most likable aspects from the predecessor — adorability and hilarity. The story is also altered where Gru (Steve Carell) is now a fervent father to his three adopted girls Margo, Edith, and Agnes, having abandoned his villainous ways of the past. But when new super-villain El Macho (Benjamin Bratt) threatens to turn Gru's lovable minions into aggressive monsters, the latter is recruited by the 'Anti-Villain League', a secret agency whose only purpose is detecting and eliminating super-villains. All of a sudden, Gru is back to juggling again — this time as a hero and an overprotective father, while actually falling for AVL colleague and sidekick Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig).For a spy-spoof animation, the story does not do much to hide its high level of predictability. Instead, the screenwriters have clearly focused on slapstick gags that are well written for viewers of all ages. There are several references to heist and spy movies that adults will mentally tick off to, while kids and toddlers are more than likely to get off to a rollicking ride from the start. Making this possible are zany new characters that add extra pizazz with plenty of loony-toon moments. One such character is Bratt's El Macho, a two faced super-villain with a psychotic chicken for a side-kick and a son that steals Margo's heart from right under Gru's nose. And while Carell's Gru takes a backseat as a reformed villain, Wiig's Lucy brings out a wacky side of Gru that is straight out of the Acme crate I had mentioned earlier. But amongst the various characters and voice talents at work, nothing can prepare you for the incredibly adorable Agnes (Elsie Fisher). Also returning from her debut role in Despicable Me, Fisher's voice acting is the essence of cuteness each and every time her character is on screen.Besides a string of jokes, both adult and juvenile, the best moments in the film are when we get to see Gru's minions indulge in screwball mischief, including singing pop music with a French twist. These are also the moments when 3D is at its intentional best, so stick around for the end credits where minions audition for their 2015 movie spin-off called The Minions. But before we get there, I recommend Despicable Me 2 for the loads of fun, joy and laughter it has in store. It is easily one of the funniest animated films of the year.",7,0,0,30 May 2014
The Avengers," Marvel has the upperhand.
","Thanks to names like Michael Bay and most recently, Peter Berg, movies that had all the makings of a motion picture event went from ridiculous to ludicrous in the short time it took a movie patron to feel the phantom pinch of money lost forever; But not if Joss Whedon has anything to say about it. And say he does! In what has to be the best super-hero action movie spectacle in a long, long time, Whedon gives you value and oomph, two sides of a coin if you will, for every buck you have put aside to watch this movie.In epic form, both visually and cinematically, Whedon's screenplay begins where 'Iron Man 2', 'Thor' and 'Captain America :The First Avenger' ends. A common thread running through these movies is Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D and proprietor of a task force, albeit super-human, put together to protect a sustainable energy source called the Tesseract from falling into the wrong hands. But it does and those hands belong to Loki, Thor's conniving adopted brother who arrives unannounced and steals the Tesseract. Following this prologue, Fury assembles the Avengers. From New York to Calcutta, Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and The Hulk converge on a mission to prevent Loki from exerting his devious plans. However, before our heroes can say 'lock and load', they have to first learn a painful lesson about he values of humility and unity.There are innumerable ways that make this movie a cinematic event for 2012. As the screenwriter and director, Whedon's first nuance is in hoisting this movie way above the hype it created ever since trailers piqued global interest last year. Up until now, we knew something big was brewing within the confines of the Marvel universe. Yet as we have seen before, very few film makers have succeeded in simultaneously pleasing Marvel fanboys as well as action movie fans. Again, this is where Whedon cuts a niche for himself in satisfying die-hard comic book fans alongside a generic cinema audience clueless about the two worlds that exist between Marvel and DC. From a cinematic standpoint, Whedon also goes as far as busting the myth that quantity is better than quality. With a plethora of Hollywood A-listers suited up in peculiar costumes (I dare say), the narration ensures that each of their characters add an equal and important input to the story. What I like about this is Whedon's method of giving each superhero 15 minutes of egotistical fame and then letting them pummel each other before receiving another round of motherless beatings from Loki and his unsightly army. During all this, the story is structured as such that none of our heroes actually gain dominance over the others. Yes, viewers will eventually find an individual preference but Whedon has cleverly taken the reliance on a main protagonist out of the equation. Personally though, I enjoyed every moment Bruce Banner turned into 'the other guy'. Then there is the icing on the cake ― Whedon's well written dialogue, void of clichés but rife with wit. Speaking of wit, this has to be the first superhero action movie induced with so much humor, that at times it is possible to miss a joke here and there. As such, Whedon's slight of hand is the perfectly timed moments when you are made to laugh right in the middle of an intense battle scene. Brilliant!Without doubt, character portrayals are just spot on with all actors in top form. As expected, Robert Downey, Jr. brings his usual flamboyance as the billionaire philanthropist Tony Stark, AKA Iron Man. Chris Evans is even better in his second outing as Captain America and is convincing as a 1940s hero grappling with current times. Again, Witty sarcasm between these two characters are well written and well placed. Other standouts are Mark Ruffalo as the timid Bruce Banner with a furious green giant lurking within, Scarlett Johansson as the sensuous and butt-kicking SHIELD agent and Jeremy Renner as the skilled archer, Hawkeye. Watch out for this guy, an up and coming one-man action movie hero rumored to take big names in some long running movie franchises. Centrally positioned as the antagonist, Tom Hiddleston's Loki brings along a malignant delusion to rule earth, whose only non-human deterrent is Chris Hemsworth's fellow Norse god, Thor. As polar opposites, both characters benefit from immersive depth by Hiddleston and Hemsworth, each having upped the notch since their previous team up in 'Thor'.Centrally themed, most superhero movies are about saving the world from annihilation. With that premise done to death, Whedon's forte is in rolling out the plausibility that society's menace cannot be brought down with the will of just one strong individual. Clearly embedded is the message that it takes unity and a lot of heart to put up a worthy defense against any and all forms of evil. Before the end of summer, a lone hero lurking in the dark will try to prove otherwise. For now, it suffices to say that Whedon has raised the bar and in the process gives Marvel a shiny new upgrade. For now.",8,2,6,3 May 2012
First Man," First Man is an intimate account of how far one man went for the rest of mankind.
","The year 2019 will mark 50 years since an American astronaut landed and walked on the moon. In Hollywood fashion, it's only fair that a film celebrates this event as a glorious and patriotic anniversary. First Man is not that film. Neither is it a full-fledged biopic as the title seems to suggest.If Whiplash, followed by La La Land were astounding films about the burning desire to go above and beyond the ordinary, returning director Damien Chazelle put's everything he's got into making First Man a poignant yet important story on what is probably the single most dangerous mission in the history of mankind. Yet until now, it hasn't seemed that way because junior school history books barely talked about the event without earmarking it as a historic date. Which is why Chazelle, along with scriptwriter Josh Singer (Spotlight and The Post) is audaciously tasked with not only gathering every detail that went into the Apollo 11 mission but also the brilliant yet impenetrable psyche of mission commander Neil Armstrong.Following the development of the space programme through the 1960s, much of Armstrong's story is told from a first-person perspective. His personal tragedy early in the film along with his real life repute as an introvert sets the tone of the film. There was nothing stopping Universal Pictures, including Executive Producer Steven Spielberg, from throwing in an extra 100 million bucks to make this film an action packed white-knuckle crowd pleaser. Instead, the entire film feels like a modest presentation of one of the most applauded events that contributed towards the modern space age. Through Ryan Gosling's deadpan eyes, Armstrong is a recluse and never the hero history says he is. In retrospect to the eventual moon landing, the space programme in this film is marred with failure after disastrous failure with funerals of fellow astronauts as the only punctuation. But all through Armstrong's progression from flight engineer to test pilot to eventually being strapped into a Saturn V Rocket aimed at the moon, we are also shown what he was as an ordinary civilian. His sorrow and self-doubt, coupled with remarkable calm and restraint, escalate into a vicious circle with each setback. Yet caught between the political pressure of the tax payer's dollar and his personal will to succeed, the film's most powerful moments are the sacrifices he makes as a father and a husband. Gosling gets this right in equal measure as Armstrong the man, the astronaut and the icon he would become.Equally decisive is Armstrong's wife Janet (The Crown's Claire Foy) who in two limited but explosive scenes jumps the que for a Supporting Actress nomination. Whether Foy gets it isn't nearly as important as her conviction in portraying the anguish of a wife whose picture-perfect family is under constant threat by her husband's employer. This is a highly relatable predicament for millions of home-alone mothers whose waking nightmare is seeing their spouse return in a casket from a job they loved more. Such was the dwindling expectation from the mission that one moving scene even has a NASA representative pen a generalised obituary to the would-be widows of the few remaining astronauts. All the courage, sacrifice and tragedy are supplemented by a large assembly of supporting roles whose teamwork and on-screen camaraderie builds a formidable launch pad (no pun intended) for the best and most rewarding segment - the lunar landing.Both technically and visually, First Man is almost flawless and deserves to be seen on the largest cinema screen available. Just like Armstrong, Chazelle also applies a lot of restraint in not only limiting exposition to a trickle, but also employing just the right amount of visual effects to tell the story. But even the little in this film instantly puts to shame the overuse of lavish visual and sound effects in big sci-fi titles like Gravity or Mission to Mars. Watching a group of suited up astronauts stuffed into a steel bucket held together with nuts and bolts is not only a claustrophobic experience for the viewer, watching that tiny capsule rattle and roll and hurtle at a speed of more than a thousand feet a second can be exhilarating and immersive. That's more than enough for the billions on Earth who can only dream of taking that flight of fantasy towards another world. First Man does that in a very intimate and down-to-earth way, when everything about this film is about a giant leap from the earth to the moon and beyond.",9,1,3,19 October 2018
Changeling," Angelina Jolie's defining moment as a leading actress.
","The Los Angeles Police Department has come a long way since arriving at its current acclaim as one of the best law enforcing units in the United States. Brainchild of the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) now used in all major crime fighting units, the LAPD's tainted history in police corruption and brutality is brilliantly depicted here with shocking consequences. While 'L. A. Confidential' and 'Mulholland Falls' were also films with a similar theme depicting police corruption of a bygone era, this film exceptionally stands out for a varied number of reasons.At the fore, yet behind the lens is an actor turned director who needs no formal introduction. With a filmography list spanning more than five decades including winning four Oscars as a director, Hollywood veteran Clint Eastwood masterfully tells a story that is not only based on actual events, but tells it in a way where you get more than what you expect; And that is, a film made with such potent ingredients, the outcome is a rare achievement in film making these days.Meticulously set against the late 1920s backdrop, this grueling narrative has Angelina Jolie playing a single mother insistently pursuing the truth behind her son's abduction. As Christine Collins, she is met with brutal opposition from the very people sworn to serve and protect. In order to save face from public embarrassment and outcry, Captain J.J Jones (Jeffery Donavan) of the LAPD partially resolves the situation by finding an imposter that closely resembles the abducted boy. But a mother knows best, and Collins immediately points out this discrepancy, embarking on a single-handed confrontation with top yet corrupt LAPD officials. When Collins prepares to tell her story to the press, she is packed off to a mental institution and is branded a delusional mother dangerously spiraling out of reality. Locked up and treated like a psychopath, her only aide emerges in the form of Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), a high profile public figure hell bent on taking down corrupt police officers. Their victory however is short lived when she learns that her son, amongst several other boys his age, may have been the victim of a deranged serial killer, resulting in a landmark case against the LAPD.Precise scripting, stellar casting that makes for tight acting, flawless cinematography integrating factual geographical locations, costumes and props, and a nostalgic score also composed by Eastwood, are the ingredients I mentioned earlier. Acting alone is top notch starting with a visually and verbally influential Malkovich whose very presence forms some of the most commanding scenes in the film. The same goes for Geoffrey Pierson as Collins' attorney in a sensational court room drama. Jason Butler Harner as the serial killer and Donavan as Captain Jones are superb as the two villains in roles sure to invoke utter loathing. Saving the best for the last is Jolie in the most significant role of her career, powerfully portraying a mother's pain. A far cry from some of the mindless action movies she occasionally stars in, Jolie is to this film what Julia Roberts is to 'Erin Brockovich', because at the core, this is one woman's true struggle against a male dominated world. Nominated for three Academy Awards including 'Best Actress in a Leading role', this film may have been the fuel behind Jolie's propulsion into Tinseltown's upper stratosphere from a supporting actress to a leading lady. Now all she has to do is stay the course.",8,0,1,1 November 2012
Men in Black 3," Three's a charm
","Last seen in 'Seven Pounds', Will Smith is back after a hiatus of quality time with the family; time that he has clearly put to good use considering the projects he has lined up over the next few years. Also returning is MIB series (now a franchise) director Barry Sonnenfeld , who, given the flaws of the sequel, has evidently jump-started the MIB saga with this third outing. Together, Smith and Sonnenfeld work their magic, but the true measure of fresh blood comes from the unlikely inclusion of a new character, without which MIB 3 would have been on an outer-space trajectory into oblivion.Now a veteran, senior Agent J (Smith) and his partner Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) continue to lookout for illegal aliens and extraterrestrial threats to Earth. Their investigations lead them onto a trail left by 'Boris the animal' a dangerous alien K imprisoned 40 years ago. Now finding that K no longer exists, J learns that his partner has been murdered in the past, so travels back to 1969 to prevent Boris from killing K and altering history as we know it.Going into this third outing, I wasn't very hopeful that Smith, nor Jones, would have any space juice left to revive the interest of Will Smith fans or sci-fi fans. Bringing Josh Brolin into the series changes all that. As the younger K, Brolin adds a much needed tenacity to this third part while ensuring his character remains vital to the story. The real crowd puller is his unbelievable likeness in personality to that of Jones, in that you can be mistaken for thinking his dialogue is voiced by Jones himself. While the first half hour of the movie appears to be treading the beaten path of the previous film, it all changes for the better once J time-jumps to the past and is heavily aided with Brolin stepping in as the younger K. This is further tweaked with Etan Cohen's screenplay, rife with ample comic moments that seem tailor made for Smith and Brolin. In comparison, Brolin comes up with some funny lines while Smith is tasked with adding depth and heart − resulting in a clever and overwhelming twist where the premise is the destructive nature of secrets. Other plot aiding roles come from Michael Stuhlbarg as a clairvoyant alien called Griffin and Jemaine Clement as Boris – the darkest alien villain in the series so far. Emma Thompson as Agent O does not add much to the story, nor is her inclusion to the film remarkable, except suggesting that O and K may have had a close working relationship.Overall, Sonnenfeld vindicates the need for a third part by putting together a good story, juxtaposition-ed with laughs and cliff-hangers. However, considering the strong sci-fi flavor this year, MIB 3 suffices as pure entertainment for the masses and is unlikely to resurrect a cult following; at least not the type stirred by 'Back to the Future'. As reported, it may be another 3-4 years before Will Smith fans see him spurt out a few wisecracks. In the interim, 'Men in Black III' is a decent choice if you want to experience a lighthearted sci-fi movie that does not require too much concentration.",6,1,3,27 May 2012
Miracle," A great example of motivational leadership.
","During the Winter Olympics of 1980, the United States men's Ice Hockey team did something no one believed they could. No one; except team coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell). This movie chronicles true events leading up to how a rag-tag team of underdogs went up against the mighty and hugely popular Soviet team.Having won the Olympic Gold just once in comparison to the Soviet's five-win streak, the US Olympic Committee has a herculean task in setting up a decent team, besides the obvious five-to-one odds of beating the Soviets. All this changes the day Herb Brooks signs on as head coach. From day one, his philosophy on beating the soviets was all about change - change in the way players think and act, including their attitude as sportsmen. Brilliantly portrayed by Russell, Brooks is not only a man on a mission; he turns out to be a fine line between a pathetic loss and a glorious win at the Olympics. To get his team in shape, Brooks starts practice sessions as early as six months prior to the opening ceremony- an approach that seemed unnecessary by many at the time. However, brook's real strategy was the psychological and physical grooming of his players. Part of this includes the psychosis of exactly what a player means to the team. As a whole, never has a message been driven so severely about teamwork than that embedded in this film.In the end, the results of the games become irrelevant, as the film is all about Brooks' methods of driving his team. In stark contrast to the film's title, the outcome was not caused by a miracle, rather, one man's vision and belief which translates into impeccable leadership that built a highly motivated team.It is indeed tragic that the real Herb Brooks passed away shortly before this film was released. But having worked with the cast and crew during production, I am sure his very presence on the sets was what added an authentic feel to this movie. While the underdog factor always remains a crowd pleaser in cinema, director Gavin O'Connor pulls this off without going overboard. By this I mean there are little or no special effects or moments that require the audience to suspend reality. Aiding O'Connor is the heavyweight script by Eric Guggenheim − a story that evades all the trappings of Hollywood and her tendency to blow things out of the water. You must appreciate the fact that Guggenheim has written a biopic of a period saga − a time when The US and USSR were still in a state of 'Cold War' and could have easily used the script as propaganda − a recurring Hollywood habit that seems to go well with some sections of the audience. Even so, the story does not loose focus on Brooks. Ironically, the film does not even show the final match against Finland, but revolves round the daunting obstacle of the Soviets. In essence, the story is a huge metaphor of not waiting for the cloud to pass, but to charge through the clouds to get to the silver lining.Together, O'Conner and Guggenheim have taken one of the greatest upsets in sporting history and made a simple film, yet one that is symbolically powerful in its message and narration. There are various other movies like 'Coach Carter' or even the Academy Award Winning 'The Million Dollar Baby' that serve as highly inspirational movies. Adding Miracle to that list will not only enrich your feel-good experience, it is a movie that has to be seen simply due to its historical significance in sporting history and how one man brought about that change.",8,2,2,6 January 2012
The Equalizer," Gruesome at times, The Equalizer is a rewarding action film for every single Denzel Washington fan out there.
","Rooting for a badass hero with a kickass attitude has never been as satisfying as watching Denzel Washington dish out some brutal punishment. This is exactly what you get in The Equalizer, an action thriller based on the late 80's TV series of the same name, but amped up with ultra-violent realism.Reunited after their collaboration in Training Day, Washington (received his first Academy Award in a leading role) and director Antoine Fuqua are back in this simple yet deadly effective action film. Using a Mark Twain quote about people who find their true purpose late in life, Washington plays Robert McCall, a loner and tragic widower with a mysterious past. On the surface, he is an amiable home depot worker who keeps to himself, indulging in conversations only when spoken too, and slave to some sort of OCD while remaining invisible to people around him. After befriending a Russian teen escort called Alina, (Chloe Grace Moretz all grownup), and discovering she is the victim of sexual abuse, McCall's nice-guy demeanor melts away to expose an aura reverberating layers of darkening complexity. There's a tightly restrained compassion in McCall's eyes, fighting a father-figure compulsion to do what he must, while Alina's is a muted plea for deliverance. This scene takes place in a diner they frequent in Boston, and it's the first of two powerful moments in the film. What follows is the film's first action sequence in a Tarantino-styled dialogue first, and blood splatter later, McCall dispatches Alina's Russian pimp and his goons. When news reaches Moscow, mob kingpin Pushkin sends Teddy (Marton Csokas), to clean up the mess. Covered with satanic tattoos, Teddy is anything but the moniker he goes by and with half the Boston PD on his payroll, it's just a matter of when and where McCall is eliminated. Or so they think.Having previously scripted The Expendables 2, Richard Wenk's story here is nothing new when considering McCall's proverbial 'set of skills', a comparison if you must, to certain characters Liam Neeson has played. On the other hand, there is a mechanism in place, partly due to the aforementioned OCD, allowing McCall a brief study of the situation before striking with lethal accuracy. While that sounds like a knock-off version of combat tactics employed by Guy Ritchie's titular hero in Sherlock Homes (2009), the payoff is watching McCall take out bad guys with improvised weaponry. It gets a bit hokey towards the end, with McCall using all manner of booby traps to slice, dice and blow up Teddy's dumber-by-the-minute henchmen. Having said that, it is still rewarding to watch Washington demolish enemy after enemy and this is largely due to Csokas' terrific portrayal of Teddy's loathsome nature. To that effect, the best scenes in the film are when Teddy and McCall are face-to-face and denting each other's armour with nothing but well written dialogues. One such scene is a powerful dinner table battering-of-wits, a taut reimagining of that iconic scene in Heat (1995).While humour and drama throw some light on Boston's mob controlled dirty cops, McCall's relationships with his colleagues, and even a short segment that suggests his origins as a trained killer, The Equalizer really shines with Fuqua's deft handling of action scenes. But topping it off is Washington in a vigilante role that is the best we've seen in years. Fans of Man on Fire (Washington opposite Dakota Fanning) and Léon: The Professional (Jean Reno opposite Natalie Portman), both films about male heroism influenced by female protégés, are in for a visual treat. Heck, who needs improbable superheroes when you have an average Joe with extraordinary capabilities and all without hiding behind a mask or costume? Although compelled to use the N-word, I'll just say – Ma man Denzel. . .doesn't disappoint and neither does The Equalizer.",7,164,240,24 September 2014
Source Code," Duncan does it again!
","Colter Stevens wakes up in a commuter train disoriented and incoherent with his surroundings. However, Christina Warren, the women beside him, seems to know him well, but adds to the confusion by calling him Sean Fentress. While Stevens is trying to figure out his true identity or lack of it, a bomb goes off, visibly destroying the train in seconds. Stevens awakens again, and this time he finds himself strapped in a small metal chamber. Through a TV monitor, Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) explains that he is indeed Colter Stevens, a helicopter pilot on a mission to secure a passenger train from a terrorist bomb. Goodwin, along with project chief Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), go on to explain that through a time loop program known as the Source Code, Stevens is sent back in time, into the identity of Sean Fentress, a casualty on a train that was blown up. Knowing that he has only eight minutes before the bomb goes off, Stevens is repeatedly sent back until he figures out the terrorist. At this point, prepare for a plot twist that can only be truly appreciated by thinking outside the box. Remember that weird kid from 'Donnie Darco'? Well, he's not a kid anymore and no longer weird. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Jake Gyllenhaal in his first ever character driven role― a role that he sinks into, like a hot knife through butter. Not only does he do justice to the well written script, As Colter Stevens, his portrayal is so convincing you actually feel for his frustration in looking for answers; answers that are against his favor. Supporting him on either side is Michelle Monaghan as Christina Warren and Farmiga as Goodwin. While both women play important roles in aiding the plot, each renders a heartwarming touch to Stevens' struggle in finding answers. Of the two, Farmiga's role has a very humanitarian touch towards the end while Monaghan's character becomes his object of survival. This is a thinking man's movie. In comparison, 'Inception' held its ground for the most part, then went overboard with the whole dream within a dream within a dream scenario. For that matter, 'Source Code' has its moments with a puzzle within a puzzle. But it stops there and gives the audience a chance to think for themselves without overdoing it with road kill. What anchors the film is the intelligent screenplay by Ben Ripley, which also happens to be his first screenplay intended for a cinema production. Although the plot can also be compared to 'Vantage Point' or 'Déjà vu', Ripley's principal ideas are rife with originality. The concept behind the plot may be shocking for some, but agreeable by most is the fact that only a genius could have come up with such an example of time travel. Again, it is not time travel par se, but using the last few minutes of life before a clinically dead person becomes brain dead. You need to watch the movie to really understand that last line. Onto Duncan Jones and I am all praises, given that this is only his second movie as a director. When I watched Jones' directional debut, 'Moon', not only was I blown away, I saw a lot of promise for a young guy directing his first movie. If I may say so, I am happy to say that I was right in predicting wonders from this guy. Along with the aforementioned script and Gyllenhaal's acting, Jones' narration grabs your attention from the very first scene and never lets it go until the end. Even then, I found myself starring at the screen as the credits rolled up. On one hand, the answers were coming to me, on the other, I was thinking 'absolutely amazing'. Oh, and one more thing. Like the icing on a cake, one little surprise is the guest appearance of a stand-up comedian who even gets asked 'what are you, a comedian?' Priceless!",Null,0,1,20 July 2011
It," Cinema has a new and ferocious monster yet It is much more than a just a horror film.
","What is it about clowns that many people find creepy? Because they hardly ever talk and are full of nasty tricks? Or perhaps because they are supposed to be funny yet that perpetual smile seems to suggest that an evil plan is being hatched. If you are one of those people who are uncomfortable around clowns, then brace yourself for It, a well-made horror film based on a classic story from none other than the 'Master of the Macabre' – Stephen King.As a horror writer, many of King's novels have found its way to the big screen, of which The Shining and Misery are still considered horror film classics, while The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile received multiple Academy Award nominations even though these are not horror films. From personal experience, I still consider Salem's Lot his most terrifying film adaptation. Both the book and the 1979 film adaptation resulted in many sleepless nights. That said, when King's books do well in cinema, it is almost always due to the director and production quality of the film being adapted (The Shining + Stanley Kubrick = classic). The same is also true when his books flop as films, which was very unfortunate for Pet Sematary and Cujo, as these are both terrifying books to read. Published in 1986 and adapted into a two- part TV series in 1990, It was generally well received but mainly due to actor Tim Curry's praiseworthy performance as Pennywise the clown. Now exactly 27 years later, It gets a shiny new remake for the big screen and it works, but not just as a horror film.The number 27 has significance in the story. You'll know why when you watch the film, but going by the book, the film adaptation is only half the story. Directed by Andrés Muschietti (whose previous effort was the lukewarm horror film Mama), the film opens with a terrifying prelude that introduces us to Pennywise, the central and evil antagonist often seen in the form of a clown. This is the scariest part of the film owing to watertight tension and an atmosphere thick with dread. But by the time we get to the end, Muschietti has traded some of that atmosphere for several jump scares. Thanks to well-engineered sound effects, these are not cheap or clichéd but nowhere near that dose of terror we were served at the beginning of the film.While It works as a horror film, it really shines as a coming of age film amped up with a strong retro vibe. As an 80s kid watching this film, I was latched on with boyish nostalgia. Outside Muschietti's method of inducing fear, what is done right is capturing the mindset of pre-teen kids from a small town in Maine (many of King's books are about towns in Maine). From that perspective, this film stays true to the book by bringing back a great sense of adventure, mystery, fantasy, puppy love, peer pressure, and then heart-break and even terror. Together all seven of them are great, but it is when these kids are on their own or isolated from the rest that the horror mechanisms in the film goes to work. It is also where imagination conjures the most bone-chilling images and sounds that only a kid that age can manifest. Pennywise, remarkably done by Bill Skarsgård, is one of those images and the very definition of a ferocious monster in modern cinema. And as far as clowns go, something tells me there could be a huge drop in kids' birthday parties at McDonald's. Just saying.",8,4,10,10 September 2017
John Wick," Oozing style and blistering momentum, John Wick is an unrelenting but thoroughly gratifying action film.
","When was the last time you saw a good old fashioned action film? I'm talking about the type of balls-out carnage that existed much before the likes of Michael Bay's dependency on faux-pas image generation. Packed with style, energy, and blistering momentum, John Wick is not just a frame by frame restoration of old-school mayhem, its unrelenting audacity kicks the growing trend for watered down action in the groin. If it is action you want, action you get – no holds barred and thoroughly gratifying.Helming the film is David Leitich as producer and Chad Stahelski as first time director, both expert fight chorographers and stunt doubles from over two decades of action thrillers. The latter was also responsible for those genre defining action scenes in The Matrix trilogy, besides standing in as Keanu Reeves' stunt double in other films. Speaking of which, Reeves hasn't been in anything memorable since the aforementioned trilogy but returns to form as the titular mob assassin whose very mention irks jittery nerves from New York City cops to the Russian mafia and everyone in between. Mourning the untimely loss of his wife, Wick is brought out of retirement after crossing paths with his former mob employers. Not only do they steal his 1969 Mustang, they also kill his adorable puppy – a posthumous gift from his wife to ease her passing. Now what do they say about taunting a man with a short fuse and nothing to lose? With an arsenal of firearms at his disposal, Wick unleashes a bullet barrage and won't stop until mob boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) and his overindulged son Iosef (Alfie Allen) join the ascending body count.Although lacking a meaty story, Derek Kolstad's script might seem like yet another revenge film that glorifies characters with a 'particular set of skills'. Needless to say, characters with this skillset are on the rise and just recently we saw Denzel Washington open a can of whoop-ass in The Equalizer. Where John Wick differs is in its unapologetic approach as a violent revenge film with no room for dramatic twists and turns. This is also what makes the film fun to watch because all you have to do is take in the thickening layers of brutality following each wave of fluidly filmed fight scenes.With intense shootouts (a hefty dollop of which are gritty head shots) and close quarter brute force, the action rarely slows. If it does, it's during moments of straight-faced humour and Kolstad's strategic placement of supporting characters. Willem Dafoe and Adrianne Palicki play fellow assassins. One aids Wick while the other is contracted to kill him. In the neutral zone is Ian McShane who plays the owner of an upscale hotel that serves as a safe house for all assassins. It's a clever touch that says a little more about their profession and the unwritten code of ethics that goes with it. As an only perceivable downside, there isn't much emotion from anyone except Daisy the ill-fated dog. Then again, it's a snug fit for Reeves and the payoff is watching him live up to Wick's reputation of a stone cold killing machine. One scene even has Viggo reciting a verse that fables Wick as the bogyman himself. I'm thinking more along the lines of Keyser Söze in the flesh. Wick-ed indeed.",8,7,20,29 October 2014
A Star Is Born," A Star is born isn't just a great remake, it's really about Cooper and Gaga's unseen talents that makes this one of the best films of the year
","Remakes can be risky. While films have been remade within short proximity of preceding films, there have been iterations that once stood out but faded away with time. This is one such film where the story is well known but it's popularity rose and fell generations ago. Which is where debut director Bradley Cooper finds himself up against his first challenge - did we really need a fourth remake of A Star is Born?The answer is resoundingly affirmative and all you need is the first ten minutes to be reeled in hook, line and sinker. But as much as this film is an absorbing crowd-pleaser, this is also an incredibly moving obituary to the fallen heroes in show business. Anyone who has seen the previous films should be aware how this will end and although Cooper respects the original story, his approach is fresh and captivating. Even so, Cooper's greatest triumph is the spell this film casts on its audience. There is magic and chemistry, which together brews a huge bowl of soul. The first half of A Star is Born is absolutely charming in the boy-meets-girl department. Playing an alternative country music rock star, this is Cooper faced with his second challenge - as the lead character he had to also learn to sing convincingly well. But as the story goes, Cooper's Jackson Maine is past his prime. There is little joy left in electrifying a sold-out concert. There is nothing more to pursue but addiction and self abuse. Ironically, and throughout the film, the chorus to Jackson's main song plays out 'It takes a lot to change a man and it takes a lot to try; maybe it's time to let the old ways die'. It doesn't happen. Not until Jackson is smitten the moment he sees Ally (Lady Gaga), an unknown singer performing at a drag bar. What follows is a new and fresh take on a timeless love story of two souls on opposite trajectories but whose paths are destined to intersect. There's a perfect blend of magnetic pull and charm between two characters, and then between said characters and the audience. This is known as screen chemistry but it isn't always convincing. We thought Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were dynamite together in Silver Linings Playbook. Then came Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's widely appreciated chemistry in the (almost) Academy Award winning Best Picture La La Land. In A Star is Born, Cooper and Gaga are not only incredibly convincing, their character bonding happens like street magic - right before our eyes but never really sure when it happens. And if this isn't convincing for the hardest of cynics, wait till you see them sing together. There can't be anything more real than the goosebumps that follow. Music as the essence of this film rings true but the story looses some traction in the second half once focus turns to Ally as the new supernova in showbiz. It's a stall for time until the inevitable happens and why A Star is Born is a heartfelt reach-out to the oft unseen and undesirable effects of being an adored entertainer. But as films like The Artist and Birdman have taught us, every star has a cycle from birth to death. Fundamentally, this film serves as a austere reminder of just that. 
 
Although Cooper has starred in some big films before, he has never performed as a singer (let alone film director). And although Lady Gaga has won multiple Grammy awards as a singer, she has never performed theatrically. This could have been the most disastrous pairing in cinema history but it's another challenge that Cooper has pulled off, albeit with near-exceptional results. There have been many before, even music divas like Madonna and Whitney Houston who attempted crossing over into cinema. Not many have succeeded. For Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, or Lady Gaga the pop star, this is the first and we certainly hope not the last. Insecure yet audacious, vulnerable yet spirited, Gaga's Ally is the literal and figurative definition of an underdog making it big in show business. Together, they make it worth every penny you pay to watch this film and it's a film you never want to end. But be warned. As the co-writer and co-producer of this film, Cooper doesn't stray far from the original story. If anything, the conclusion is far more overwhelming than expected. But backed by a strong supporting cast and a terrific list of songs, this version is not only the best compared to the previous films but also one of the best films of the year.",9,4,9,11 October 2018
Gravity," I haven't seen a more engaging film all year.
","The essence of a film lies in its ability to astonish us beyond what we imagine to be possible (or impossible). Every year just a handful of films manage to do this by leaving us in a state of awe and euphoria. For 2013, this is it - GRAVITY is a state-of-the-art film that you experience, rather than just watch on a big screen. And years from now, it will be remembered for setting new benchmarks in the filmmaking industry. Cinematically speaking, this is not just my best movie of the year by the manner in which it is made or narrated, but because of the way it will change the world of motion pictures as we know it. Last year it was Ang Lee's LIFE OF PI and few years ago it was James Cameron's AVATAR. While the common thread running through these films are generous eye-popping visual effects, GRAVITY is far more superior in style, soul, effects and showmanship. That being said, there isn't much of a story here, and like LIFE OF PI before, the central theme is a white-knuckle do or die survival story. But that's where the comparison ends. The opening scene is an unbroken 15 minute long-take that introduces us to veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) and Mission Specialist Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) as they repair the Hubble telescope 600 kilometers above Earth. Matt is commanding his final space mission while Ryan is on her first. They joke around a bit, converse with mission control in Houston (voiced by Ed Harris) and a third astronaut working in the background. Then comes the dreaded 'abort' after Houston warns that debris from a missile hit Russian satellite is headed their way. At speeds nearing 20,000 kilometers an hour, this debris becomes shrapnel that rips through their space shuttle, simultaneously killing the crew and severing communications with Houston. Barely surviving the hit, Matt and Ryan are now tiny white dots against the black expanse of outer space. And that's not even the bad news. Low on oxygen and tumbling through hostile conditions of space, their only hope of survival is reaching the International Space Station before the aforementioned debris returns within orbital striking distance. Matt estimates they have 90 minutes to get to the space station. Incidentally, this is also the runtime of the film where everything happens in real-time proximity. All through this runtime, Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón maintains a visceral deadlock between the viewer's state of awe and the terrifying ordeal playing out on screen. But even against increasing panic, shortness of breath and imminent death, the narrative switches to a frantic fight for survival by clinging on to mankind's most innate virtues – hope. Bullock embodies this in the role of a lifetime by constantly allowing her character to evolve. At first she is a rookie medical engineer on her first space mission, then a terrified individual with a tragic past, before learning to tap into the essence of the human spirit. Bullock has come a long way from driving a bus in SPEED to sidelining (excuse the pun) the competition in her Oscar winning THE BLIND SIDE, to flying an entire space station in this film. THIS is Sandra Bullock at her finest and every iota of her portrayal demands another Academy Award nomination. Close behind but with less screen time is Clooney. Equipped with witticisms and pep, Clooney is exactly what you would expect from and actor-director with a thoroughbred resume.For most of us, GRAVITY is the closest we will ever get to feeling what it must be like in space. This is Cuarón's gift to the cinema industry and the discerning audience alike. Having co-scripted the film with his son, Cuarón's greatest achievement in this film is the technical nuance that has gone into its making. Cinematography is literally out of this world with some of the most spectacular vistas of Earth. There are scenes where the lens shifts from infinite space to within an inch of Ryan's face - a seamless juxtaposition of the vastness of space with claustrophobia. Sound design accentuated by Steven Price's original score is another contrast between surreal imagery and the eerie loneliness of space. These are not just effects in the conventional sense but a profound manner of grafting special effects with the character's emotions and the darkening atmosphere of the narrative; all in 3D that is not only immersive but in a way that becomes the skeletal binding of the story. Phenomenal!As an only perceivable flaw, GRAVITY can seem preachy at times, underscored by slim propaganda that says something about the selfless courage of the elite – men and women who risk life and limb for the greater good of humanity. Then again, such was the message in last year's Academy Award Best Picture ARGO. At the time of writing this review, awards season 2014 is still a few months away. But from where I was seated, I am looking at no less than nominations for sound design, visual effects, cinematography, best leading actress, directing and quite possibly, Best Motion Picture. And then some.",9,3,4,18 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Lone Survivor is nowhere in the league of an epic war film but it deserves recognition as a visceral achievement in depicting modern warfare.
","Hard-edged, gritty and unrelenting, Lone Survivor is an action packed war film that is equally moving and as courageous as some of the tragic real life characters it is based on. While the story is a visceral achievement in depicting modern warfare, the film itself couldn't have arrived at a better time than at the start of a new year. And if this trend continues, 2014 should be another great year at the movies! Written and directed by Peter Berg, Lone Survivor stands testimony to the ill-fated 'Operation Red Wings' – a covert ops mission in 2005 that sent four US Navy SEALS into the Afghan mountains to track and eliminate a high ranking Taliban leader. Berg's narrative uses the first twenty minutes to introduce us to these valiant men. We get a peek into their personal lives – some are newlyweds, others have pictures of their infants. They talk about their hopes and dreams and providing for their families back home. We also get to see what makes them elite soldiers – real life footage of their rigorous training before graduating into Navy SEALs. But out here in a US military base in Afghanistan, their only family is each other. Bound by brotherhood, courage and sacrifice, they are Lieutenant Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Petty Officer First Class Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Petty Officer Second Class Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Petty Officer Second Class Matt Axelson (Ben Foster). The mission is supervised by Lieutenant Commander Erik Kristensen (Eric Bana) via satellite communications at a remote US base. Outfitted with the latest military hardware, including high caliber firepower and over watch from a high altitude AC-130 gunship, you would expect a bravura show of force. However, Murphy's Law dictates their fate and the first disaster comes knocking in the form of civilians tending to goats. Almost instantly, they become sitting ducks against a hateful enemy in an extremely unforgiving terrain. It's all downhill from here and as the title predicts with ominous certainty, only one of these men make it out alive; that too, barely.As expected in a Peter Berg film, action is heavy and consumes more than half the running time. Battle scenes are thick with the zip and ping of bullets and shrapnel flying in every direction. It gets to such a frenzy that you begin to lose track of who is firing and from where. To counter this, Berg employs frequent 'pink mist' scenes of silhouetted blood spilling to signify confirmed hits. Then he cranks it up to a point where you start to think these SEALs are death defying superheroes. But if this film is based on actual events, then heroes they are, because seeing is believing. Also noticeable is the heavy handed vibes of patriotism emitted through the film. This is second nature for Berg, especially if you have seen The Kingdom, a similarly themed action spectacle that speaks volumes on the culture clash associated with the ongoing war on terror. Even with Berg's signature aspects embedded throughout the film, patriotism is hoisted to a whole new level by honoring the lives of America's slain sons. As a mass media obituary of sorts, this is reserved for the final segment where we get to see the real men who perished - eighteen individuals who made the ultimate sacrifice so that freedom remains a birthright in the motherland.Real combat heroism is not about racking up the body count or triggering spectacular explosions. Real soldiers don't have endless clips of ammo or nerves of steel; or so we have seen in epic war films like Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down. On the other hand, Lone Survivor is nowhere in the league of an epic war film but it deserves recognition as an action-thriller that packs a wallop in suspense driven firefights. Tension mounts even before the first shot is fired and Berg has some of these pre-skirmish scenes tightly packed into a powder keg. Wahlberg and rest of the supporting cast make this possible, even as stuntmen provide visual plausibility for some unbelievable scenes of physical trauma. And although the film ends on a sombre note, there is an indulgent bit of Hollywoodism in the final act that is almost laughable. But after Berg's last travesty, Battleship (2012), the overall making of Lone Survivor resonates the progression of a rising action film director. Welcome back Pete! All is forgiven.",7,2,5,30 January 2014
This Is the End," This is Not Really Funny.
","Frat-pack comedies hit an all-time high (excuse the pun) with THE HANGOVER. In an attempt to raise the bar, THIS IS THE END goes all out as an obnoxious, sexist, and highly outrageous inside joke. And the joke's on Hollywood. The film is essentially set in two parts where we are first introduced to Hollywood celebrities playing themselves. These are not A-list celebrities but established comedians like Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and actors of similar ilk. Basically, just about anyone from a Judd Apatow production. They are all here and they play themselves in the most unbelievable manner allowed in an R-rated comedy. The central theme is male bonding with Jay Baruchel exhibiting said issues when his friend Seth Rogen is invited to a party hosted by James Franco. At the party they meet Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Jason Segel and everyone else you can think of who are not in the same frat-pack league as Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and the likes. As you can imagine, the party is swinging with alcohol, weed, women and crude sexuality including a self-indulgent Michael Cera. But just when you think this is going to be an amped up version of SUPERBAD or PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, the story shifts into darker territory with an apocalyptic end-of-days scenario straight out of the Book of Revelations. What follows is a bizarre attempt at survival but filled with slapstick moments of under-belt humor, decapitation and dismemberment, exorcism, and an unending array of sex-gags; all of which are nothing new to the genre, but questionable as an outrageous comedy that literally grabs Armageddon by the balls. Is it funny? The answer to that question relies heavily on how much you like these actors or their previous films. We have seen Hollywood actors play themselves in similarly themed comedies. Think Neil Patrick Harris in the HAROLD & KUMAR franchise or Bill Murray in ZOMBIELAND. But by sharing scripting and directing duties with Evan Goldberg, Rogen's achievement, at best, is pulling jokes within jokes. There are multiple references to various Hollywood celebrities (even one about George Cloony and Sandra Bullock), about themselves and characters they have played in their own movies. All this may sit well with die-hard fans but what about the casual movie-goer with little or no tolerance for unintelligent storytelling? THIS IS THE END gets to a good start with cameos of famous actors playing exaggerated versions of themselves. Emma Watson and Rihanna included, Hill even refers to his Academy Award nomination in MONEY BALL. Then things turn for the worse once Danny McBride arrives on his one-trick-pony, playing his usual crass and narcissistic self. In not saying that the film is entirely unfunny, it is also far from bland. Then again, this becomes a matter of choice. What all this boils down to is the fact that these actors are clearly having fun by mocking themselves. And by doing so, they are also saying that they can afford to do so because the awful truth of the matter remains that as long as idiots pay to watch their movies, they get to walk the red carpet and have a blast in the process. But thankfully, all is not lost if you save your time and money for a similarly themed but far more boisterous comedy instead – THE WORLD'S END.",5,24,50,15 September 2013
Creed," With grit, style and substance, Creed goes the distance as an exceptional crowd pleaser.
","History has a strange way of repeating itself. 40 years ago, Rocky Balboa became a household name and turned an unwanted actor into one of the greatest success stories in Hollywood. The fact that Rocky (1976) won three Academy Awards including Best Picture is of little importance compared to the real life struggle behind the making of that film. For Sylvester Stallone, it was a rags to riches story that mirrored his real life struggles to make a decent and honest living. Cut from the same cloth maybe, but Creed is much more than just the seventh installment in the Rocky film franchise. As a no- holds-barred sports drama, this is every bit an exceptional crowd pleaser with a lot of heart, plenty of amusing jabs to the ribs, and an unexpected but emotional haymaker to the gut. And a lot more.Co-written by director Ryan Coogler, there's no doubt that Creed is a passionate love letter to the first film, which in itself is a poetic love story about fighting the good fight. Although boxing is the central theme, and often frowned upon as a brutal blood-sport that causes serious injuries, it's never been about the fight but more about what you are fighting for. Coogler gets this spot-on when we are introduced to teenager Adonis Johnson in juvenile detention. We soon learn that Adonis is the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, born shortly after the latter's death in Rocky IV. Appolo's widow Mary Ann (Phylicia Rashad) rescues young Adonis from what is certain to be a life on the streets and raises him as her own in the plush Creed estate in Los Angeles. Cut to present day and Adonis (Michael B. Jordan) is a corporate executive half way up the ladder. It's a stark contrast to Stallone's blue collar stiff in the first film, but this is where both films converge. Like Rocky, Adonis (calling himself Donnie) knows he is destined for something else, so heads to Philadelphia to meet his late father's rival turned best friend.The meeting with Rocky is one of several great moments in the film while also serving as a nostalgic homecoming occasion for every fan of the franchise. It's a fascinating intersection of the past but none better than the fact that in many ways, Creed is an inverted mirror image of Rocky. And before sending this film off on its own pulsating trajectory, Coogler reveals a full hand of spades. One of which is the legacy Rocky bestows on Donnie, and in essence, Stallone handing over the franchise baton to Jordan. We may not realize this at first and that's because we are already smitten by the father-son relationship developing between Donnie and Rocky. Their character study is the most significant aspect of this film. Donnie has always been an orphan and the reason why he never took on his father's name is an emotional revelation. Who he is and why he wants to become a professional boxer is his darkest secret.Both equally emotive and with comic interruptions, Jordan and Stallone deliver impressive performances. Stallone in particular gives what has to be his career best performance since Copland, and if this is his franchise swan song (owing to a devastating but befitting plot device) that's all the more reason why this film must be seen. But as they say, the show must go on and Jordan is more than capable of shouldering future films under the Creed banner. And with the inclusion of Philly local Bianca (Tessa Thompson), Donnie's neighbor and love interest, future sequels look to be set in Rocky's beloved hometown.Onto the production quality and it suffices to say that Creed has THE best technical aspects in the franchise, including spectacular fight choreography, astounding cinematography in the ring and around Philadelphia, and an upbeat hip-hop soundtrack fused with the original score from previous films. The only real letdown comes from Donnie's main opponent (Real life professional boxer Tony Bellew) who isn't as antagonistic as you would expect, given the villainous ferocity from Clubber Lang (Rocky III) and the evil Ivan Drago (Rocky IV). But that's a minor blemish to an overall outstanding film made with grit, substance and style. At its best, Creed is a very intimate film for fans and newcomers and an undisputed knockout for 2015.",9,162,242,25 November 2015
Orphan," Nice little thriller with a good twist.
","From that 70's horror classic that started it all (The Omen), right up until 2009's 'Case 39', the 'evil kid' plot line has been steadily evolving into a whole new genre. As such, we have seen several times before, how a cute and apparently sweet child manipulates and brutally murders all that stands in the way of a pre-conceived, albeit evil plan. Having just watched 'Case 39' recently, I was expecting the same experience here. Boy, was I wrong! Unlike the aforementioned films, what works here is the strength of stellar acting combined with a plot that escalates into a crescendo of suspense. David Leslie Johnson's script starts with a horrific prologue where the lovely and very talented Vera Farmiga is heavily pregnant, as Kate Coleman. In the presence of her husband John (Peter Sarsgaard), their third pregnancy ends in a bloody mess, quite literally. Although a vital segment of the plot, I must say the prologue has a very B movie feel to it, made worse with soft focus camera work, confusing the viewer into believing this to be Kate's nightmare. But apparently it did happen, and almost a year later, Kate is still suffering the loss of what would have been their third child. In filling an ever increasing void, Kate and John decide to adopt Esther, a 9 year old Russian orphan with remarkable charm and intellect for her age. As Esther settles into her new home, her bond with Kate's deaf-mute daughter is instantaneous, while her step-brother is less cordial and is the first to sense her ominous personality. Before long, Esther turns out to be an odd-ball in school, even as Kate discovers at an alarming rate, that adopting her may have been a bad decision. On the other hand, John disagrees, causing a rift between the couple and opening old wounds. Just as the situation starts to boil over, Kate uncovers Esther's deep dark secret and must do all she can to protect the lives of her family.After slipping under the radar, past his directional debut remaking 'House of Wax' (2005, featuring Paris Hilton), Jaume Collet-Serra re-emerges here darker and stronger in only his third film and second attempt at the horror/thriller genre. From a directional standpoint, Collet-Serra delivers a neatly done package, complete with tight acting, solid build up of suspense through great pacing, and a perfectly timed twist most viewers won't see coming. His pacing of the plot allows enough time for considerable character development. Essentially, this is what draws us into the lives of Kate and John and their little family, up until they adopt Esther. After this point, the pace increases with a lot of focus (or obscurity) into the mystery behind Esther and her motives. Not but until the end, when the twist emerges, are we left guessing Esther's true motives and origins: evil incarnate or just a child deprived of affection. Either or neither, the answer is astounding, and Johnson's concept is fresh, despite our temptation to compare Esther with Macaulay Culkin's sinister Henry Evans, in 'The Good Son'. Collet-Serra also dares to go where other directors tread lightly, especially since the very nature of this film is taboo when considering the storm it has stirred amongst parents with adopted children. Then there is the controversy of what a child actor can and cannot do or say in front of a camera. Again, this is what differentiates 'Orphan' from similar films, because the direction here is bold, structured and clever, and pushes all boundaries. Of all the positives I can think of, the list topper will definitely have to be the exceptional performances from Farmiga and little known Isabelle Fuhrman as the antagonist. I will let you be the judge when I say that Fuhrman steals the show from the moment you see her and carries that uncanny charisma all through to the end. Step aside Dakota Fanning; make way for Isabelle Fuhrman as a force to reckon with. Aside from these two, Sarsgaard puts in his usual sleepy-eyed performance but is shadowed by Aryana Engineer as the couple's deaf-mute daughter; good input from another child actor.All said and done, the near perfect script is not without some blaring clichés and unnecessary tributes. As with most recent thrillers, you can expect some jumpy moments, predictable one-liners and that chilly atmosphere snowy cinematography gives to horror thrillers. Co-produced by Leonardo DiCaprio, look out for a scene here in tribute to his final scene in 'Titanic'. Farmiga's one-liner in the last scene is also reminiscent of Harrison Ford 'kicking' Gary Oldman off his airplane in 'Air Force One'. While most viewers may find this movie original enough to be conceptually shocking, there will those who may find it a tad bit contrived. Even so, this is a movie about children, and for the most part, acted out by children. But given the MPAA rating of R, this one is strictly adults only.",7,1,2,3 July 2011
Spotlight," Impeccably written and crafted, Spotlight is a first class drama and a standout for 2015.
","If I am allowed just five words to describe Spotlight, those words would be Stellar, Scandalous, Stupendous, Spectacular and Sensational. But even these words can't afford enough praise for a visceral film about honest and instinctive journalists devoted to pursuing truth in the interest of justice.These journalists are a crack team of investigative reporters assigned to the titular arm of the Boston Globe. Led by Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton), with newshounds Michael Rezendez (Mark Ruffalo) and Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), the team goes to work when new editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) suggests a closer look at sexual abuse allegations in Boston's predominantly Irish-catholic population. Through exhaustive interviews and investigations, the Spotlight team goes from isolating 'bad apple' priests in Boston, to indifference in the Massachusetts law enforcement and all the way up to the Vatican. What the team finds is not only the biggest cover-up by the Catholic Church but equally shocking is the fact that documents proving the cover-up existed all along while no one did anything about it. And even worse is the revelation of not just a flaw in the system, but a 'phenomenon' all over the world. Based on actual events in 2001, co-writer and director Tom McCarthy exerts restrained precision on how this original story is told. Although rated 18+, McCarthy avoids visual reenactment of these abuses but still brings out the pain and trauma of victims through interviews with the team. Just hearing their ordeal is as gut-wrenching as having to see the act. They are now adults, but when they describe what was done to them, they cry like babies, like when you take something away from a baby. One extraordinary scene has Sacha interviewing a retired priest. You can almost feel the lump in her throat when she asks him if he ever molested a child. The smiling priest casually replies that he 'fooled around a bit' before disclosing that he himself was raped as a child by another priest. Another scene has a juvenile choir singing Silent Night. Almost instinctively, you wonder if those kids have been touched. McCarthy has a few of these chilling moments to reiterate just how important this film is, but keeps it simple to follow despite a blistering pace.From cluttered newsroom desks to locations around Boston, Spotlight feels highly authentic in narration, detail and performance. At a time when major newspapers were on the decline, the film captures the anxiety of these reporters, their fear of being made redundant by the internet boom, competition from other newspapers, hence why they must remain the best at what they do. As an example of detail, McCarthy even uses the 9/11 attacks as an event that threatens to shut down the Church scandal, but the team's focus remains undeterred. And so do the ensemble cast. Keaton, especially after his comeback in last year's Birdman, is definitely here to stay. But it is Ruffalo that takes center stage as a relentless and inquisitive reporter married to the job. From hustling his way between courthouses and lawyers for and against Spotlight (Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup) and accessing restricted information, Ruffalo is at his outstanding best. There's another great scene when his character flares up in frustration. For a second I thought he would rip through his clothes and turn into an angry green giant. Casting and delivery, along with an intelligent and impeccably written story makes Spotlight a standout for 2015 and a first class film at that. Altogether, it's a good old fashioned drama celebrating good old fashioned journalism. Just as gallant as the pursuit of truth, the film too ends up pure and absolute. And the five words I used to describe this film? I'd also trade them for a Star each.",10,4,6,17 December 2015
Youth," Both visually and narratively, Youth is a satirical take on the hardships of ageing.
","No review of Youth can be written without mentioning its striking resemblance to a Wes Anderson film. But where Anderson has found a niche in simplifying his characters, director Paolo Sorrentino's approach isn't as spoon fed. Almost entirely told through ironies and metaphors, Sorrentino uses a non-linear narrative, and contrary to what the title says, his running commentary is a satirical take on the hardships of ageing. Fittingly, screen veterans Michael Cain and Harvey Keitel are in the lead and they are both excellent. Cain plays Fred Ballinger, a retired music composer/director, while Keitel plays Mick Boyle, a famous Hollywood director out to make his last great film. As best friends vacationing at a luxuries hotel in the Swiss Alps, they are both past their prime and they know it. Each struggling with personal demons, they also know that this could be their last meeting, but not before leaving behind a legacy. Along with them are a plethora of oddball characters – Ballinger's daughter and assistant Lena (Rachel Weisz) jilted by her husband for an ugly pop star, a Hollywood actor researching his provocative next role (Paul Dano), an obese soccer legend with health issues, a monk who wants to levitate, a Miss Universe out to prove that she's not just a pretty face, and a Hollywood actress too proud to remember her origins (towering performance from Jane Fonda) to name just a few. Where and how these characters fit in is up to us, the audience, and Sorrentino has an Easter egg hidden behind each of them. For a multi-layered narrative, Youth can feel disjointed at times and even superficial, but that's a matter of perspective and precisely where this film shines. And although delivery from everyone is outstanding, with Cain at his stellar best, the real star of this film is cinematographer Luca Bigazzi. Every frame is perfectly composed and reminiscent of Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel . Only here it's not just about picture perfect landscapes or tightly framed close-ups. What Bigazzi does with available light and shadow is just stupendous. Nudity in particular are breathtaking moments shot with restrained taste, while conveying the ultimate sense of freedom beyond human inhibitions. Another night scene in Venice had my thoughts racing to that haunting fatality scene in Under the Skin. Likewise, there are several other scenes where the camera does a lot of the talking even when characters are mute, almost as if aping Fred's explanation of his music - 'You don't need words to understand it. It just is'.More than anything, Youth is a series of powerful metaphors about friendship, love, regret, and looking back on a life that was. It's not the most moving or original, and there's barely a single plot running alongside its deliberately paced 120 minutes. Then again, it's all about perception and as art house films go, beauty is always in the eyes of the beholder.",7,1,3,11 December 2015
Ready Player One," Ready Player One lacks a solid story but excels as pure escapism at the movies.
","Breaking the post Oscars lull is Spielberg's Ready Player One, a Sci-fi action-adventure throwback to not only the golden 80s of cinema, but also popular video games and music of that era. In fact, there are so many references in rapid succession that if you blink, you'd miss a few. That's not saying the film is perfect. For a project assembled with layer after layer of pop culture references, including the movie magic of Spielberg's yesteryears, Ready Player One lacks a solid story. Also, what should be a thoroughly nostalgic experience at the cinema is overladen with visual effects just because the studio (own Amblin Entertainment) can afford it.Still reading? Good, because despite some blaring faults, the film is still watchable thanks to a few terrific moments that hold everything together. Now imagine stepping into a virtual world where you can be whoever you want to be. Thanks to our current and rising addiction to social media forums, the film predicts that by 2045 much of humanity will live in isolation but connected through virtual reality. Called the OASIS and linked in via VR headsets, anyone can do pretty much what they want, and accordingly reap benefits or face the consequences. Staying alive and rising to the top of the leaderboards often require expensive power-ups and upgrades in both the OASIS and the real world. Which is where we meet Wade Watts, the underprivileged teen protagonist who dreams of winning the ultimate prize - a glowing Easter egg that comes with immense fame and fortune in both worlds. But getting there is the ultimate challenge, especially when Wade has to compete with villainous corporations in addition to the A-Team, King Kong, T-Rex, Freddy Krueger and Lara Croft to name just a few. 
 
With the Easter break round the corner, Ready Player One is perfectly placed as an understated pun in itself. But in blaring its trumpet, the film tries to be the mother goose of golden Easter eggs with references to several cinematic 'events', the pinnacle of which is a fantastic tribute to a classic horror film. It's gets heavy handed from there, and because we are looking at photorealistic CGI characters, the film turns out to be more animation (albeit in ultra-high definition) than live action. While that's not such a bad thing, watching this for nearly the entire length of the film can get rather tedious. The teen romance that begins to take shape midway doesn't help either and neither is it required.Yet among all the frantic action and chaos, Ready Player One has a nuanced message about the disintegration of society and everything that's joyful about real human feelings. As Mark Rylance's James Halliday, founder of the OASIS puts it, 'As painful as reality is, it's the only place you'll get a good meal'. That's an insignificant line in the film if you don't stop and understand what it means. Ponder a bit and it's clear that we wouldn't need any form of escapism if we were all living in a perfect world. But reality bites. We know it and that's why we invented escapism. The movies have always been an escape, and despite the lack of any relatable character, the film more than makes up with social commentary that stings. The fact that the film is set in the future but made to look like the past only cements the notion that while the future is blank, the past has many fond memories we can always escape to. Without really trying hard, that's all this film tries to be. And who better than fanboy number-one to take us back, to the future.",7,3,12,28 March 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Powerful and thought provoking, yet scary
","Let's get one thing clear right from the start- This is neither a James Bond movie nor a Jason Bourne movie. There are no fancy cars or high-tech gadgets, no cheesy introductions or unstirred martinis. In essence, this is a true espionage thriller and feels very authentic right from the plot down to very minute details.Adapted from the book by John le Carré, a fictional novel that spawned a seven part mini-series in 1979, this 2011 theatrical release chronicles the hunt for a Soviet mole within the highest ranks of MI6, a division of British Intelligence. Set during the cold-war era, the head of the British Secret Service, Control (John Hurt), sends agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) to Budapest to buy information on a sleeper agent implanted in MI6 by the KGB (Russian Intelligence). The mission is a disaster and repercussions forces Control into retirement. When allegations of the existence of a mole persist, George Smiley (Gary Oldman) is brought back from retirement. Smiley has always been suspicious of standing chief Percy Alleline (Toby Jones) peddling bogus Soviet intelligence files to the Americans in exchange for important US intelligence; or project 'Witchcraft' as it is called. Now onboard with three high ranking agents, Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), Roy Bland (Ciarán Hinds) and Toby Esterhase (David Dencik), Smiley can trust no one and must follow the trail when he learns that Witchcraft is also being sold to a Soviet diplomat. Watching this movie, cinema goers will be split into two very distinct groups ― one section of the audience will love this movie in its entirety. The other will see the movie in bits and pieces of a fragmented plot, and may walk away before the story begins to unfold. Yes, the story here is complex and may require a second viewing for some. However, watching it unfold is a reward in itself. With a little attention to detail (and there is a lot of detail), a vast majority of the audience should have no difficulty in following its narration. This is the first English film by Swedish director Tomas Alfredson but one that is soon to be his golden ticket into mainstream Hollywood. There are so many ways in which this film excels that I don't know where to begin. What I find most compelling is for a dialogue dependent movie, there are very few scenes of character interaction that are extensive in verbal exchange. All other scenes with dialogue are short and sweet while giving away vital information in bits and pieces. This brings me to Alfredson's best moments in the film ― the use of silence. You learn more about what's happening when characters don't speak; their eyes do a lot of the talking as does their body language. These scenes are so perfect that you can almost read their thoughts or hear the phantom conversation between two intentionally mute characters or tells you something is about to happen without anyone actually saying anything. Another technical aspect is the camera work, which I find an uncanny aid to the plot. There is a lot of zooming and panning, and stationary close-ups of certain objects like the still of a drop of sweat when everyone is wearing warm clothing. It is scenes like these that put you in perspective of what it must be like to be a spy ― to put your finger on something odd, to trust your instinct and sometimes why it is important to trust no one. Characterization is another area of excellence with solid portrayals from everyone. Oldman does not have many lines in the movie but his eyes do a lot of the talking. From judging and probing to emotions of fear and sadness, he conveys a lot without actually saying anything at all. Except for Bram Stoker's 'Dracula', Oldman has hardly ever played a leading role; neither has he ever been nominated for an Oscar. If seeing is believing, then I think he has a good chance for at least a nomination, come Oscar season 2012. Supporting roles are also flawless from a huge lineup including John Hurt, Mark Strong, Tom Hardy and of course Colin Firth― 2011 Oscar winner for Best Actor. I have not read any of John le Carré's novels, but in comparison to Ian Fleming's super spy, Alfredson's rendition of Le Carré's world is very convincing. I always assumed that a spy would have to be a lonely person living a desolate life. This is so true in the movie with many characters looking over their shoulder while living in vast emptiness. Even so, it brings to light that these individuals have chosen to give up a 'normal' way of life so that you and I don't have to.",8,1,4,16 January 2012
The Hateful Eight," Hateful Eight is Tarantino going back to his roots – Verbose, violent, and thoroughly unpredictable.
","Molasses is a word used more than once in The Hateful Eight, Quentin Tarantino's cleverly titled eighth film. When you first hear the word spoken you don't think much of it. It's when you hear it again that you start to draw on its literal and figurative meaning. Chronologically, this is his ninth film (Tarantino considers Kill Bill: Vol. 1 & Vol. 2 as one film) but the one common aspect in all his films is the known fact that as the writer and director, Tarantino is in no rush to tell his story. Just as viscid as molasses is the narrative, but also as concentrated, making this one of his most verbose, bloody and thoroughly unpredictable films. And binding everything together is an even more concentrated dose of tongue-in-cheek humour that is an absolute treat for every Tarantino fan. It takes 'patience' to get there though, another word used overtly to tell the audience that the wait is worth the reward. Told as a post- Civil War era western in whiteout Wyoming, The Hateful Eight is essentially a tightly wound potboiler seamlessly knitted into a whodunit murder mystery. And although the story seems like a Tarantino original, the plot summary appears to have germinated from the same nucleus that made And Then There Were None Agatha Christie's magnum opus. The similarities are there, yet somehow Tarantino's masterstrokes feel intimately traditional, like a nuanced director returning to his roots. That tradition is felt almost entirely through the film, beginning with his signature approach to compartmentalising the narrative into chapters. Crossing over one-third the length of the film, Chapters one, two and three serve as the introduction to eight characters so eclectic that the film could have also been titled 'The Fateful Eight'. Leading the pack are bounty hunters Major Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) a former Union army soldier, and John Ruth (Kurt Russell) on the way to the town of Red Rock to hang his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) for a bounty of $10,000. After picking up a fourth passenger, Red Rock's newly appointed Sheriff Mannix (Walton Goggins), their stagecoach stops for the night at a desolate cabin called Minnie's Haberdashery. Here's where they (and we) meet the remaining four – Red Rock's Hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), retired Confederate army General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) a cowboy working on his autobiography, and Bob the Mexican, the cabin's caretaker. Trapped by a terrible blizzard on the outside and confined to suspicious strangers on the inside, tensions rise when most are not who they claim to be. Thus begins Chapters four, five and six, and traditionally where Tarantino lets the proverbial 'shit hit the fan'.Before that happens, suspense driven buildup takes precedence by way of character driven performances and spitfire dialogue from everyone including whimsy cameo appearances. With Jackson in the lead and at his profane best, the remaining ensemble offer concrete support, each equipped with electrifying delivery and nestled surprises. But none more than the film's most concealed character - with a constant smirk on her face, Leigh's Daisy is perhaps Tarantino's biggest Easter egg with an unpredictable outcome. Equally delectable is the heavy dosage of dark humour, both witty and outrageous, and at an all-time high for a Tarantino film. So is the racial slur, which peaks in the form of an epic sex gag between Warren and the N-bombing Smithers. While Django Unchained proved to be homage to the 60s era of Sergio Leone westerns, The Hateful Eight feels more like Tarantino's first real thriller. Shot in 70mm Panavision with the legendary Ennio Morricone (who invented the Spaghetti Western genre with Leone) providing a tense and menacing soundtrack, this could not only prove to revive the western but also Tarantino outdoing his own brand of wickedly entertaining audacity. And lauded more for his screen writing than his diabolical exploitation, this is probably his fastest film to get through even though it's over three hours long with a plot that thickens with each passing minute. Perhaps even thicker than molasses.",9,1,11,12 January 2016
"I, Tonya"," I, Tonya subverts a tragic story into a black, comical and unexpected piece of pop culture history.
","Introducing itself as 'irony free, wildly contradicting, and totally true', I, Tonya is a fiercely entertaining exposé on one of America's most famous yet equally hated personalities in sports history - Tonya Harding. That name not only generated a media frenzy in US championship figure skating, it was also riddled with infamy owing to events that were both outrageous and scandalous. But at the heart, this is a tragic story of a sports star fallen from grace. 
Contrary to the introduction, the film is indeed a huge irony that asks whether Tonya had any grace at all. And if she did, was it unfairly snatched away by the all-encompassing judge and jury we know as society. But before we get to the film's first most anticipated moment - the incredible triple-Axel jump which no other American figure skater had previously attempted - we are introduced to Tonya at age 4. She is on the ice with her skates. She is a natural. The ice skating teacher can see that. The teacher also sees that Tonya and her mother are from the wrong side of the tracks. This would prove to be Tonya's single biggest challenge but also her drive to fulfil her dream of becoming an Olympian. The second most anticipated moment is what everyone in the film refers to as 'the incident'. The narration, nevertheless, through fake interviews or by breaking the fourth-wall, doesn't detract from the fact that this was the last straw in Tonya's career as a figure skater. While every sports magazine and TV channel were quick to turn Tonya into a villainous monster, I, Tonya is nuanced by the black comical moments leading up to 'the incident'. Instead of answering the question on every viewer's mind (there's a pause where she directly addresses this to the audience), the film is at its gripping best when we learn about Tonya's many personal issues, including domestic and emotional abuse involving her mother and her (now) ex-husband. Between the constant mother-daughter squabbles and love-hate relationship with her husband, Tonya emerges as young woman with true grit rather than the ice skating princess everyone expected her to be. 
 
Sharply written by Steve Rogers (rom-com screenwriter and not Captain America) and directed by Craig Gillespie, this dark satire not only takes a stab at the hideous and vain nature of the sport but also the sacrifice, pain, physical and emotional bruising Tonya endured just to be accepted as any other aspiring figure skater. Lending a wide range of emotions (and even a glint of Harley Quinn), Margot Robbie is at her best as manic Tonya and impressive in every scene. But even as Robbie delivers her best performance to date, Allison Janney as Tonya's iron-fisted mother is an absolute treat with an unending library of expletives. From her introductory scene to the tune of Cliff Richard's 'Devil Woman' to messing with Tonya's head, to shaping her into a champion, Janney's LaVona Fay Golden is just that - show stealing gold in every scene. Together, Robbie and Janney are the muscle and sinew of this film while subverting a tragic story of a sports star fallen from grace into an unexpected yet unforgettable piece of pop culture history.",8,0,0,2 March 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," Great Snakes!
","Back in 1988, cinema audiences were spellbound with 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', a live action film that integrates conventional animation. 21 years later, James Cameron upped the ante with 'Avatar', a superb universe rendered by 80% motion capture animation. Although Cameron took ten years to materialize what he often refers to as his pet project, Steven Spielberg has been an avid Tintin fan since the early 1980s. So you and I can only imagine what levels of passion and energy must have gone into the making of this film. In two words, stunning and spectacular! In terms of visual brilliance and sheer magnitude of scale, Spielberg as director and Peter Jackson as producer has outdone everyone else in the film making industry. THIS IS the new era of animation and more than just recommending this film as a must watch, I urge you to witness for yourself, what will soon be referred to as the groundbreaking turning point in the world of animated films.Titled 'The Secret of the Unicorn', Tintin's adventure here is actually combined with two other books by creator Hergé, namely, 'The crab with the Golden Claws' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure'. Integrating these three books into one epic screenplay is the phenomenal work of British screenwriters Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish. With this movie, Tintin embarks on a perilous adventure when he buys a three-mast model ship for a steal. He soon learns that this scaled down version of 'The Unicorn' is much more valuable than it seems and it is one of three identical models. After evading a mysterious buyer called Sakharine, TinTin discovers that each model ship is made to conceal a secret message. Before he can investigate further, Tintin finds himself bound and gagged on-board a ship. With the help of his trusty fox-terrier dog Snowy, Tintin is freed but literally bumps into the ship's skipper, captain Haddock. Consumed by years of ill-luck and dependency on the bottle, Haddock soon realizes that he is but a pawn in Sakharine's grand scheme of things and that there is more to the latter than meets the eye. Together, Haddock and Tintin must now outwit Sakharine in finding the other two model ships, but not before coming face to face with haphazard danger and a centuries old family secret.Early reviews of this film compared it to the likeness of 'The Polar Express', a 2004 animation that was one of the first to use motion capture technology. With Motion 'performance' technology, the difference is huge as there is no real comparison to any other animated film so far. Digital 3 D adds extra depth and clarity but there aren't many moments that will have you bobbing and weaving or extending your arm to grab something splashed out of the screen. Jackson's trump card is Academy Award winning visual effects supervisor, Joe Letteri— the man responsible for visual effects from 'The Abyss' (1989) to 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' (2011) and almost every big budget movie in between that required a heavy dose of CGI. Once again, Letteri delivers beyond expectations with such visual quality, you have to see it to believe it. While close-ups are gorgeously detailed, wide-angle scenes look unbelievably realistic. Some background characters look so real, you have to look again to figure out if real humans were filmed. Character's noses are somewhat disproportionate and oddly shaped, but this is in keeping with Hergé's original art work from the comic books. On that note, this film stays true to the comic books with various characters popping up here and there, along with keeping with the Noirish period setting of the books. Tintin fanboys will savor every moment of the film. In the packed cinema hall, I could easily differentiate sections of the audience that were Tintin fans as compared to other viewers. Most probably intended by Spielberg, there are scenes and dialogue that only a true Tintin fan would recognize and appreciate.Most notable as one of the Bielski brothers in 'Defiance', this is Jamie Bell in his first ever lead role as the titled boy-reporter. Bell is perfectly cast and vindicates Amblin Entertainment's choice in bringing Tintin to three dimensional life. Voicing the villainous Sakharine and another character I don't want to mention, Daniel Craig is good but somehow appears more cynical than sinister. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost voices the bumbling Thompson twins and contributes to some of the comic moments in the film. For me, the show stealer is definitely Haddock with some of the best lines, best scenes and some great moments including a spectacular flashback. Kudos to Andy Serkis again! After Caesar in 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', this is his second lovable character this year. Other nostalgic characters include Aristides Silk as the pickpocket, Allan the goon and Bianca Castafiore as the Milanese Nightingale.On a whole, this movie is not short of action, suspense and comedy and provides great entertainment for the whole family. There are plenty of Spielberg's hallmark swashbuckling moments as seen in his last directorial 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'. As such, get set for one roller-coaster of a cloak and dagger ride with Tintin, Snowy and Haddock dodging bullets, ducking swords and chasing villains. For an animation, I did feel a void when it came to emotional characterization. Unlike 'Bambi' or 'The Lion King', there isn't a single moving or heart tugging moment. Then again, I don't think Spielberg intended for this as the books are too fast paced for any sort of emotional attachment with the reader.On a final note, and if you think you see Spielberg's name all over this movie, I see something more: An Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature, as this may not be Spielberg's best movie to date, but it is easily the best animated film of 2011.",Null,0,3,5 November 2011
Fast & Furious 6," Dom is at it again
","Having resurrected the series after the critically panned sequel – 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS - returning director Justin Lin rigs this sixth installment with an action packed cocktail of nitrous oxide and adrenalin; a perfectly blended chemical compound that will have you laughing out loud even as you clench your toes through the film's high-octane action sequences.Picking up where FAST 5 ended, US Diplomatic Security Service Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) grants fugitives Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and former FBI Agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) a full pardon if they help him take down criminal mastermind Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Toretto is of course uninterested, until Hobbs reveals that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is alive but working for Shaw. A far as the synopsis goes, that's all you need to know, because that's all there is to it. To be fair, the FAST & FURIOUS saga has always been about high speed races and chases and less about character development or a mindboggling story. And Like the preceding films, the background story in this sixth installment is literally in the back seat, with emphasis on the ride rather than the destination. Neither is FURIOUS 6 the type of film inclined towards rocket scientists or viewers searching for logic. George Smiley burrowing after a Soviet spy within MI6? No. Regular doses of humour, peppered with death-defying stunts? Yes, and there is a truck load of it and it comes at you just as the title promises. This, essentially, is what makes FURIOUS 6 subjectively indulgent, with or without the popcorn. However, there is food for thought and fans of the series could be split debating whether or not this film is the best in the series. Although Lin injects a fresh canister of cinematic nitro, this latest episode lacks a worthy antagonist even though this film has the largest character ensemble in the series. On that note, characters don't die and dead ones are brought back. While there is a timeline-unknotting-explanation for that, the fact remains that Shaw is heavily outnumbered, and it shows. After five globetrotting adventures, Dom's 'family' has increased in size with many characters reappearing from previous films. In addition, Hobbs is no longer an advisory and along with his team of Special Forces sharp-shooters, becomes Dom's souped-up armory on wheels. There are also issues with continuity amid rip-off moments from iconic action films (think Lethal WEAPON 3). Through all the vehicular carnage, characters can take a beating, and still appear unfazed and unharmed. This carries on till the final skirmish onboard a cargo plane on a take-off run, on what has to be the world's longest runway! Real pilots in the audience would probably wet themselves laughing. But despite its flaws, some even absurd, FAST & FURIOUS 6 is a high energy action movie and competently made. Fans are treated to having Rodriguez back and there is a whole subplot about her 'new' character. Tyrese Gibson is also back but this time, more than ever, serves one real purpose and that is to shoot out some well-timed one-liners. As a summer opener, it not only revs up the fun-o-meter but also hurtles past the competition as a lucrative action film franchise. Bruce Willis - kindly heed that last line. While it is unusual for sequels to get better with each release, the FAST & FURIOUS franchise seems to mature with age and there is a very strong suggestion of a seventh installment. An end credits scene confirms this with the introduction of a new character. Pay attention to the film's baldness joke and you might just figure out who joins the cast in the next movie. If you do, you might also win premier passes for FAST & FURIOUS 7!",6,1,2,8 September 2013
The Way Back," A film as powerful as its central message.
","1939- Poland is divided between Hitler's forces from the West and Stalin's red army from the East. A Polish soldier on the Russian front, Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is betrayed by his wife and sentenced to 20 years, having allegedly spied for foreign powers. Imprisoned in the Siberian Gulag or high security Soviet POW labor camp, Janusz first meets inmate Khabarov (Mark Strong) who has devised a plan to escape. Over the following two years, Janusz befriends a small group of inmates who would eventually aid in his and their escape from the Gulag. 1941- Seven inmates escape from the high security Gulag. The convicts include Janusz, an American engineer, Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), Valka (Colin Farrell) a hardened thug, and four others, an artist who can cook, a Pole with night blindness, a priest and an accountant with a sense of humor. Escaping from a POW camp surrounded by guns, dogs and barbed wire was the easy part. What lie ahead is the harshest elements of nature, starting with five million square kilometers of bitter cold Siberian landscape, an unforgiving desert and a second onslaught of frozen mountains through the Himalayas. Over and above, they endure this journey with dwindling supply of food and water, while avoiding contact or help from locales for fear of getting caught. Along the way they pick up a young woman on the run from her past, this despite the fact that she can slow down their escape to freedom. Of the seven escapees plus the young woman they take along (Saoirse Ronan as Irena), only three will arrive in India, 4000 miles from the Gulag, and all on foot. Adapted from 'The Long Walk', a book that sold half a million copies and written by Sławomir Rawicz, this is a powerful film that tells an epic story; a story that is inspired by actual events during Rawicz's alleged escape from the Gulag. Historically, the facts remain murky as others have claimed to have escaped from the Gulag, whereas Rawicz was supposedly released by the USSR. Having also co-written the screenplay, six Oscar nominated director Peter Weir claims that such an escape exists as archives in Polish museums in London, England and Stanford University in California. Aside from Rawicz's book, part of the script is also inspired from autobiographies of some of the fugitives, titled and verified in English as 'Shallow Graves in Siberia'. Facts and debates aside, this is an exceptional film that captures the human spirit in surviving against all odds. Although seven men had their own ideas of freedom beyond escape, only three were noted to have made it to their destination. This is either testament of Darwin's theory of 'survival of the fittest' or of something far more profound— that humans as a species are capable of anything we set our hearts and minds on. From the filming perspective, I am satisfied with almost all aspects of the production. Acting is top notch from everyone including the European actors. While Sturgess and Harris are very convincing, Colin Farrell and Dragoş Bucur offer some comic relief in well punctuated spots. As Irena, Ronan is a welcome addition to the posse of fugitives while her acting says she has clearly progressed from a child actor and looks powerfully ready for bigger and central roles.Co-produced by ImageNation Abu Dhabi, with filming on locations in Bulgaria, Morocco and India, the highlight of the film is the sweeping cinematography. No wonder then, because National Geographic has had a hand in the production as well. Photography is breathless and places the viewer right in the middle of the Siberian cold or dehydrating heat of the desert. While illustrating these terrible hardships for the characters, make-up is terrifying and realistic, resulting in an Oscar nomination. For the acting, directing, screenplay, cinematography and general production, Peter Weir should be credited as a tour-de-force for this phenomenal piece of work. Running over two hours, I do feel that Weir could have built more depth into some of the characters given that many scenes are dialogue heavy. But as a standalone production, this is ample proof that given the right focus and vision, Independent films have as big a scope in powerful film making as compared to films backed by major production and distribution studios.",Null,1,2,3 September 2011
Horrible Bosses," Separating the men from the wolves!
","This is a 'wolf pack' movie all the way. What do I mean by Wolf Pack movie? Simply put, a group of famous actors playing a small group of guys ( usually buddies) on a mission where each has a fair share of the agenda, or in this context— the misadventure. The term originated as slang in the late 1980s where actors like Emilio Estevez, Robert Downey Jr, Kiefer Sutherland and even Tom Cruise and Kevin Bacon were often referred to as the 'Brat Pack', often portraying the young and restless. A second wave of brat packs emerged with the likes of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and few others after the hugely successful 'Oceans' franchise. However, films like 'Zoolander', 'Wedding Crashers' and everything in between, including both versions of The Hangover have actors like Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and a huge list of emerging others currently referred to as the 'Wolf Pack'.Movies featuring a wolf pack are usually dark comedies and very often, guy flicks— or men's version of a romantic-comedy, minus the romance of course. With 'Horrible Bosses', the wolf pack comprises of Jason Bateman as Nick, Charlie Day as Dale and Jason Sudeikis as Kurt, buddies who can't stand their bosses. Overdue for a promotion, Nick has long endured his psychotic and manipulative boss played by Kevin Spacey. As an assistant, Dale is sexually harassed by his orthodontist boss played by Jennifer Aniston and Kurt has to deal with a racist, drug addicted and cruel boss played by Colin Farrell. When the trio finally decide that enough is enough, they setout on contracting the services of a hit man—a person with an unusual nickname but a person who is about to teach them a lesson they will never forget.Of the various reasons that make this a 2011 standout comedy, the foremost has to be the ensemble cast. Aside from leads like Bateman, Day and Sudeikis doing what they do best, Spacey, Aniston and Farrell add an extra jab of humor, making this a film where everyone offers a good dose of laughter. If that weren't enough, there is plenty to be had from another lineup of guest appearances. As such, it is hard to place any actor above the rest. But if I was to choose, I would have to stick both thumbs up, one for Charlie Day and the other for Kevin Spacey. While Day's character is rife with slapstick moments, Spacey is a real treat to watch and is the most loathsome of the three bosses. On that note, Aniston is not far behind in a role totally unlike her usual Miss goody-two-shoes. Forget everything other movie you have seen her in; this is Aniston like never before—raunchy, provocative and very, very direct.After the ill-received 'Four Christmases', Seth Gordon has evidently upped a few notches with precise directing and the use of a well edited screenplay. There is clear chemistry between the three leads and Gordon uses this by getting the viewer to like them despite their murderous intentions. From a directional standpoint, this is what makes the plot engaging. Sure, it gets a bit clichéd and overdone towards the end, but if this movie can make you laugh out loud at least thrice, then Gordon has done his job with ample relevance to the genre. I know I did. I also know that given this year's share of wolf pack comedies, 'Horrible Bosses' has the edge over 'The Hangover Part II'.",Null,3,6,12 October 2011
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Despite the plot looming towards the familiar world domination, the setup is layered with a background story that develops like photographic film.
","After almost dropping the ball with last year's fiasco – Iron Man 3 – Marvel is back with a bang and it's a good bang for your buck. Captain America: Winter Soldier is a smack-down superhero film that finds itself wedged in the higher echelons of the Marvel franchise. X-Men: First Class (2011) was one of the first films in Marvel's nine film franchise to successfully graft superhero fiction with real world events. Picking up on the ethos that the world as we know it is not what it appears to be, Winter Soldier begins with a prologue similar to classic espionage thrillers. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), our titular star spangled super soldier, is air dropped onto a S.H.I.E.L.D vessel captured by Algerian pirates. Standard fare breach and entry tactics if you asked me, but before you know it, Rogers finds himself entangled in a web of conspiracies perpetrated by sleeper cells within S.H.I.E.L.D. Barely able to bridge the gap between the 1940s and modern day advancements in technology, Rogers is now weary of who he can trust. To connect the dots he must now backtrack all the way to the origins of S.H.I.E.L.D. and figure out who is the friend and who the foe – Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) or senior official Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford). But even before Rogers unmasks the villain, an old threat resurfaces and proceeds to wreak havoc with a secret weapon – the deadly stealth assassin known as the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). Going in for a superhero film, it is only natural to expect high doses of CGI fuelled action. But what happens when you are 'fed' a lot more than you expect? The three-word answer to that question is Man of Steel – DC Entertainment's self embarrassing rendition of brawn over brain. In comparison, sibling directors Anthony and Joe Russo, along with returning screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely work with plausibility by wisely choosing mind over muscle. That doesn't mean action takes a back seat either. After the low profile opening act, wait exactly thirty minutes for the action to pick up and then surge towards a cliffhanger finale. Despite the plot looming towards world domination, albeit a familiar theme in similar films, the setup is layered with a background story that develops like photographic film. This is where we learn why the Winter Soldier is a diabolic mirror image of Captain America - a pawn (or should I say Trojan horse?) in a terror threat orchestrated by a shadow organization that has manipulated worldwide chaos for decades.Once again, Evans doesn't disappoint as a superhero who is a patriot first and a hero second. Supporting Evans is the super suave Scarlett Johansson returning as Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, a highly skilled S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who turns out to be more than just a pretty face. Also scripted for this film is Marvel superhero Falcon (Anthony Mackie), an ex-paratrooper who becomes Cap's friend and vital aid during some white-knuckle aerial battles. Jackson and Redford blend in as the 'powers that be' while Stan puts on a terrific show as a villain who is as cool and powerful as Cap himself. They all contribute to the film's look and feel and each of their characters comes with at least one witty line to boot. This again echoes my sentiments on how well this film is written and directed. Captain America: Winter Soldier is a good film if you have a thing for superhero movies. On the other hand, true Marvel fans will march a step forward and even call this a 'Great' film and a welcome addition to Marvel's long running superhero franchise. And by the looks of it, this franchise is far from over; two end credits scenes reveal more to come, where the first one introduces viewers to Magneto's children. Stay seated and buckle up, that's all I'll say!",7,0,1,3 April 2014
Life of Pi," Remarkable, Incredible, and years from now - Memorable.
","The last time director Ang Lee made a tiger crouch, he walked away with about a dozen Oscar nominations, all from just one film. This time Lee goes all the way by unleashing the dragon – this is not just a beast of a movie, it is nothing short of a cinematic miracle in everything that it sets out to be. Possibly the best adapted screenplay this year, LIFE OF PI remains true to its award winning source material by Yann Martel; at least for the most part. Just like the novel, the story plays out in three parts, starting with the introduction of Pi and how he was named after a swimming pool in France. Narrated by Irfan Khan as the older Pi, the story is set in 1970s Pondicherry, a former French colonial city in India. Born and raised a Hindu, Piscine Molitor Patel, the teenage protagonist and titular character dwells into the beliefs of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, without claiming any one religion as superior. Pi's father, a business minded zoo owner has other priorities like migrating to Canada, along with some of the exotic zoo animals for sale once they reach their destination. In a cruel twist of fate, the journey is short-lived soon after they sail into the Pacific Ocean on a cargo ship. Although tragic in nature, the sinking of the freighter, along with Pi's parents and elder brother, is emotionally overwhelming yet visually spellbinding as the first of many sequences Lee and cinematographer Claudio Miranda has in store for the audience. What follows is a fierce and fascinating tale of survival when Pi finds himself in a lifeboat with an injured zebra, a merciless hyena, an orangutan and a fearsome but majestic Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. Right from the opening credits, Lee and Miranda mesmerises us with one of the most incredible set pieces ever built for cinema. Forget what TV spots and teasers are calling this movie. Judging from what critics have to say, LIFE OF Pi is indeed an epic visualisation but not necessarily justifiable in its comparison to AVATAR. Apart from the novel use of 3D in both films, I personally can't think of any other similarity. Lee's use of 3D is not just immersive for the sake of being so; it becomes the skeletal binding to the pulsating flesh and blood of the story in such a way that I actually forgot about the 3D spectacles resting on the bridge of my nose!Thanks to David Magee's adaptation, Lee has made possible what acclaimed filmmakers have previously side-lined as impossible to film. From virtual humming birds hovering at arm's reach, to the scene when we first meet Richard Parker, to embellishing the sheer beauty of creation, Lee has broken new ground in the way cinema interprets literature. No doubt there. However, Lee's nuance as a storyteller is in bringing out the book's underlying significance of subtly suggesting the existence of God, through a relentless test of faith. This is done by two actors: Suraj Sharma as the ship-wrecked younger Pi who exalts God even in the most trying situations. The other actor is of course Irfan Khan, whose retrospect narration to a writer proves the very existence of God. For a débutant, Sharma has a large chunk of screen-time and holds the story singlehandedly with some amusing interjections. On the other hand, khan has fewer scenes but skilfully advocates the phrase that less can prove to be more.From where I'm seated, LIFE OF Pi has a sure fire lock-on for a few Oscar nominations. But the real reason this is a must-see film, preferably in 3D (I can't stress this enough), is because there is every bit of passion in its making from surreal cinematography, a soul stirring original score, to spectacular visual effects, and a phenomenal narration that only ends when you hear an inner voice that says 'Believe'.",9,4,8,20 December 2012
Tangled," One of Disney's best.
","When German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm started collecting folk tales around 1806, little did they know that 200 years later, their faces would be immortalized on a bank note of the highest denomination. Although the Deutsche Mark has been adopted into the Euro, the Grimm Brothers' (as they have been come to be known) story does not end there. From folklore to fairy tales to bedtime storybooks, their enchanting tales have continuously evolved until its present day rendition in cinema. And so we have 'Tangled', a fluidly narrated, vividly colorful and stunningly animated version of Rapunzel, the original title from a compiled list of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm. In this latest version, Nathan Greno and Byron Howard directs, while Dan Fogelman tweaks the screenplay without straying too far from the original tale. In a kingdom far away (no, not the same kingdom in 'Shrek') the Queen is aided during childbirth by a rare flower with magical healing properties. Unbeknown to the King and Queen, an old woman has been keeping herself young and alive for centuries with this flower, but now finds that the healing and rejuvenating power of the flower has transferred to baby Rapunzel during childbirth. The old woman named Gothel then kidnaps Rapunzel and locks her up in a tall tower knowing that the little girl's golden hair holds the power to keep her from aging. Naïve to the outside world, Rapunzel grows up believing Gothel to be her mother but is fascinated by seeing thousands of floating lanterns once every year. Just before her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel's life changes forever. Having stolen a royal tiara, a thief breaks into the tower but soon learns the hard way that Rapunzel is not a damsel in distress. Together, they escape the tower and head towards the kingdom, but not before having to deal with Gothel, her assassins and the King's royal guards. For a year that gave us quite a few animated features, Disney's 'Tangled' came in third in terms of box-office performance. While 'Toy Story 3' took the top spot, 'Shrek Forever After' managed to secure a second place despite its overdone theatrics and lack of originality. For this reviewer, the real competition was between 'How to Train Your Dragon', 'Despicable Me' and 'Tangled', all of which features an engaging and original story. While 'How to Train Your Dragon' is cinematically epic, our film under discussion is superior in terms of production and visual brilliance. With a budget of $ 260 million, this is not only the most expensive animated film ever made, it is also the most time consuming, having been in production for six years. The staggering amount of time and money put into this project stems from the fact that Disney has invested in animating hand-drawn images and then injecting three-dimensional depth by employing over 50 CGI artists. The result speaks for itself- a gorgeously rendered animation with such detail, it has to be watched on a HD display to truly appreciate the skill that has gone into its making. What makes this film different is that it carries the High Definition clarity found in PIXAR animations, but with the added bonus of having the original art work traditionally hand painted. I were to guess, Disney has gone through such lengths to produce another animation, probably because this is their 50th title, an accolade in itself and a milestone in this company's 80 year history as a media conglomerate.Like most other Disney productions, the story here has a fare share of fantasy, romance and comedy. Even so, Disney ventures into unchartered waters with elements of sadness, some violence and a scene of drunkenness. Voiced by Donna Murphy, Fogelman's Gothel is not a witch but a woman with a dark heart who is capable of murder. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel and along with Murphy, lends their voices for some of the film's soundtrack as well. Zachary Levi voices the thief called Flynn Rider, a character who is neither a Prince nor charming. Although Rider and Rapunzel's initial scenes together are met with slapstick comedy, the funniest characters for me are, a royal horse called Maximus and Rapunzel's pet chameleon, Pascal. On the other hand, soundtrack is not as catchy as Disney's famed animations like 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'The Lion King'. Although nominated for an Academy Award for 'Best original Soundtrack', this film lost the Oscar to Toy Story 3. Even so, Moore and Levi's duet with 'I see the Light' is as visually stunning as it is pleasing to the ears.",Null,2,4,1 October 2011
American Sniper," Made with palm-sweating tension and based on a real life military sniper, this is Clint Eastwood's best war movie in a long time.
","American Sniper is Clint Eastwood's second 2014 film (after Jersey Boys) and the best we have seen from this veteran film director in years. Contextually, this film looks and feels like 2008's Academy Award winning Best Picture, The Hurt Locker, but with Eastwood's deft storytelling, American Sniper is equally Entertaining and thrilling, yet dramatic and tragic, and wrung with palm-sweating tension throughout. Based on memoirs of the highly decorated US military sniper, Chris Kyle, the film opens in Iraq in 2003, and sets the tone for the rest of the film. Kyle (Bradley Cooper) is in prone position on a rooftop, rifle in hand, and tasked with over watch as an infantry unit kick down doors in search of insurgents. He sees a woman and child approaching the unit but must make a split-second decision on whether they pose a threat to his fellow soldiers down below. His spotter reminds him that he could 'fry' if he kills an innocent woman and child. His gut tells him otherwise. Just when his finger is wrapped around the trigger and ready to squeeze, we are taken back on a 25-minute flashback. We see him raised in a conservative Texan family, then through rigorous Navy SEAL training, and then courtship, marriage and parenthood. It's a vital segment that makes us want to care about him and the decision he is about to make. It is also where we learn Kyle's three main priorities – God, Country, Family – values that would go on to make him a 'Legend'.It takes four tours of Iraq and 160 confirmed kills to earn that proclamation but we don't get to see as many kill shots. Between taut firefights in Iraq and coping with the anxiety of his wife (Sienna Miller) in Texas, we get hard-wired into Kyle's psyche thanks to a career-best performance from a bulked-up Bradley Cooper. After Academy Award nominations in Silver Linings Playbook and last year's American Hustle, Cooper is on a hat-trick and this is definitely a side of him we have never seen before. Miller, on the other hand, gets to portray the wife of a soldier and she delivers with seasoned skill, but these scenes are too few and short for a screenplay intended to venerate a war hero. And how it does! With about 90 percent of the screen time dedicated to Kyle, we are given a complex character study of an individual tasked with preserving or taking life. Unlike other war films where soldiers kill counterparts 'in the line of duty', Cooper's Kyle often finds himself wrestling with an almost obsessive compulsive disorder but one that ensures his wife and kids remain free and safe in the motherland. However, the ramifications are close behind. As much as Kyle is revered by his peers and commanding officers, the price on his head swells, and so does his reputation amongst insurgents as 'The Devil of Ramdi'. In the wrong hands, American Sniper could have been misconstrued as American propaganda. Look no further than Peter Berg's The Kingdom, a right-wing hoopla that literally screams 'us versus them'. Instead, 84-year-old Eastwood shows restrain for political subletting, especially given recent headlines on the on-going 'war on terror', by telling a well-knit story of courage, determination and patriotism. Not since his very own WWII double-feature, Letters From Iwo Jima, and Flags of Our Fathers (both in 2006), has Eastwood been so confident and controversial in an action film. Dusty, smoky, war torn Iraq feels authentic and that's before some frantic gunfights reserved for the many action sequences. While action scenes can get quite heavy and violent, at times it feels like a portion of a first-person-shooter video game. Then again, American Sniper is all about Chris Kyle, his POV, and why the US military could benefit from more soldiers like him. Towards the end, one scene has Kyle pull off a near impossible shot with utmost precision. It's one of several reasons why Kyle will always be known as 'The deadliest sniper in US military history'.",8,37,76,21 January 2015
Forrest Gump," As long as no one considers a sequel, Forrest Gump will remain a classic.
","When I saw Forrest Gump, Rocky suddenly became a close second on my list of favorite movies. Although both these movies are totally different in genre, budget, plot and even levels of acting, their common ground in my opinion is they are both underdog stories. But why Forrest Gump is my favorite movie of all time is way beyond its underdog factor. It is the nature of the film, with an overwhelming message of innocence of heart and purity of soul that I still find an unfathomable experience every time I watch this movie. I have watched it many, many times, and each time I am deeply moved by its simple yet profound inner meaning.As Alan Silvestri's soul stirring original score plays through the opening credits, a single white feather twists, turns and drifts through the air, ultimately landing near the protagonist's dirty running shoes. Waiting at a bus stop, Forrest Gump picks up the feather and places it in a bedtime story book he's had since a kid. As another patron sits besides him waiting for a bus, Forrest narrates his epic yet unbelievable story. And what a story it is! In flash backs it narrates how as a child he was an outcast in society only because his IQ is below average and acceptable levels. But as Forrest continues his story, the one person who believes he is no different from anyone else is his mother, and through her can-do attitude, how he got to be where he is: A decorated Vietnam War hero commended by the US President, an international sports icon commended by another US President, how he influenced pop culture, and how he got to be recognized by Fortune magazine as a multi-millionaire.The very few cynical critics who also enjoyed this movie, feel Gump's fortune from impossible twists of fate are implausible coincidences any real person may never encounter however lucky that person may be, more so with below average intelligence. Maybe so. But let's not forget, Albert Einstein had to re-sit his college entrance examination before he started theorizing rocket science. Coming back to Gump, you have to see him to believe that honesty and loyalty are virtues very few people possess, but for the ones that do, achieving greatness will seem like miracles from heaven.And now for the people who made it all happen. Collecting his second Oscar for best actor in two consecutive years (first Oscar as Andrew Beckett in Philadelphia, 1993), Tom Hanks as Gump is absolutely outstanding and redefines the way you pronounce the word 'chocolate'. Easily the most memorable role of his career thus far, Hanks will make you laugh, cry, and fall off your seat doing both. To this day, John Travolta regrets having turned down the role, and for good reason, as I can't think of anyone else who could have done it the way Hanks did. Playing Gump's only friend, mentor and commanding officer having lost both legs in Vietnam is Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan in his first and only Oscar nominated supporting role. Another exceptional feat here, and together with Hanks, forms some of the best parts in the movie. Hanks and Sinise would appear again just a year later in the dual Oscar winning Apollo 13. Playing the women influencing Gump's life is Sally Field as his 'mama' and Robin Wright as his one true love, building on a life long relationship since childhood. Both Field and Wright's characters are played flawlessly in a way where Gump's method of reasoning comes from his mother while the inspiration behind his adventures comes from Wright's character as Jenny. Also worth mentioning is Michael Conner Humphreys as young Forrest, who reportedly influenced Hanks' southern Alabama accent and the introduction of Haley Joel Osment as Gump's adorable son. Yes, the same kid who sees dead people in Sixth Sense.Finally, kudos to director Robert Zemeckis for this brilliant achievement in contemporary film making. Adapted for the screen by Eric Roth (another Oscar) from Winston Groom's novel of the same name, Forrest Gump is to Zemeckis what the Mona Lisa is to Leonardo DA Vinci. Besides the six Oscars generated including 'Best Director' and 'Best Picture', the true mettle of his work lies in integrating the various components of this film into one history altering, ground breaking, block-buster. What we have here is one movie with multiple genres of war, comedy, romance, drama and tragedy all rolled into one unforgettable classic. With friends like Steven Spielberg and Josh Lucas, visual effects and CGI are incredible to say the least. And to think this film was made more than a decade before Celine Dion's duet with Elvis Presley. If I explain that last line, I'll be letting out some of the best treats of the film. The only way Zemeckis can undo himself now is if he makes a sequel.For those who think Forrest Gump is too much of a dim-wit to make it in this real and fierce world, then these are the people to watch out for, because they are predators who can screw you over without so much as batting an eye lid. And for those who think Forrest is a character in a modern fairy tale, then stop for a second and reflect on what a fairy tale really is. It may be nothing but a fable, but it is always a fictitious story with a moral message. Whether this fable has a happy ending doesn't really matter, as long as the moral of the story is understood loud and clear. And so I can go on and on as to why you should watch this movie, or buy it and frame it and buy another copy just to watch it every other month; but I can never emphasize enough that each time you watch this movie, it will be like reading a chapter from Chicken Soup for the Soul.",10,3,5,17 June 2011
Ant-Man," In comparison to previous Marvel films, Ant-Man is an engaging reiteration that less can be more.
","Along with its mega box-office pull, Marvel's cinematic achievements have also gained a reputation for being loud and repetitive, with emphasis on sheer size and scale. But as we've seen before, it can also be uplifting, laugh-out-loud funny, and thoroughly engaging – all instantly recognisable qualities of Ant-Man. By cutting out multi-character excessiveness from previous films, Ant-Man is also scaled down to size, albeit literally, with the use of just one protagonist. This works by allowing us to focus on the adventures of an everyday man, but one that is destined for incredible heroics. That man is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a petty criminal desperate for a clean slate. Caught between his reputation as a cat burglar and a failed father, Lang stumbles upon a powered suit that shrinks him down to the size of an ant. 'It's nothing like the Ironman suit', says inventor Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a former S.H.I.E.L.D scientist. Quite literally, Douglas is saying two things at the same time - don't underestimate the power of an ant, and also that Ant-Man is unlike any other character we have seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Overlooking bland melodrama that has Lang trying to impress his daughter (primed with stock Hollywood cuteness), the film really opens up when we see the titular superhero in action. Filmed with Arri Alexa cameras, visual effects from Industrial Light & Magic is mind bindingly stunning when switching back and forth between macrophotography and life size rendition. Also look out for a de-aged Michael Douglas in the pre-credits prologue (set in 1989), made possible with the use of motion capture technology. And given the context of the story where a lot happens in microscopic proportions, effects are aided with the proper use of 3D, resulting in a rare occasion where it actually works in favour of the cinematography. With just the right amount of action combined with potent laughs (watch out for Michael Pena Peña as a motor mouth), Reed, in combination with comedy writers Joe Cornish and Edgar Wright, keeps the story simple and easy on the eyes. And owing to the obvious detachment from the juggernaut trappings of previous MCU films, there's none of that city demolishing nonsense that has become a standard in superhero films. Instead, the story remains enveloped in the fantasy ethos that illustrates how an ordinary person can become extraordinary. The fact that Rudd (up until this point) has been cast in romantic-comedies makes him the ideal choice to play this unlikely hero. Equally unlikely is Peyton Reed, having directed a string of romantic-comedies that nobody remembers. There's a reason why their collaboration in Ant-Man works to everyone's benefit, much the same as Chris Pratt and James Gunn, who were both underrated before 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy. While it's apparently easy to make blockbusters with over the top action (looking at you Michael Bay!), Ant-Man is self-aware of its limitations, resulting in another rare occasion where less is more. That alone should be a educated answer to an age old debate – Does size really matter?",8,6,16,30 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Oh Captain, My Captain!!
","Uncle Sam would be proud. Holistically, this film looks like one mass recruitment campaign to get men enlisted into the US armed forces. Then again, this is nothing new. As a superhero, Captain America personified the might of the US military during the actual second World War to intentionally create a sense of patriotism against the 'Axis Powers' led by Stalin and Hitler. Picking up on that idea, the well known source of this concept is Marvel comic books and brings to cinematic life, a spectacular and glorious vision of how invincible a US soldier can or should be.Almost entirely, the film is a flash back after a rare metallic shield is discovered in the present day Arctic region. Rejected by the military during WWII, scrawny and frail Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) gets a second chance after a selfless act of bravery. As a result, Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) allows Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) to administer Rogers with a serum, immediately super-sizing the latter into a 'Super Soldier'. Shortly after, Erskine is killed by an assassin deployed by Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving). As Hitler's advanced weapons expert, we learn that Schmidt has assembled an army to possess and control a mysterious cube with infinite power, after being injected with a flawed version of the serum perfected for Rogers. Now christened 'Captain America' and literally draped in stars and stripes, Rogers and Stark Industries must stop the evil Schmidt from destroying America with weapons of mass destruction.Cinematically, the film is in epic form and relives the bygone era of the 1940s with a strong retro vibe. Having said that, I now find myself educated that a fraction of WWII consisted of technology that still does not exist. Ray guns, behemoth tanks, one-manned submersibles and gunships that look similar to those used in 'Avatar'? I wasn't alive in the 1940s, but I am pretty sure that other movies with a 1940s or WWII narrative must have somehow omitted the use of this technology. Sarcasm aside and for argument sake, as a viewer I can suspend reality for the sake of the Marvel universe. In an alternate history this could be plausible. 'X Men: First Class' was smart enough to establish that thought process right from the start. Shooting from the hip with pomp and propaganda, 'The First Avenger' expects (rather than assumes) viewers will believe the world created for the movie. It is at this point where you should stop and think for a minute. If you are not a Marvel OR superhero fan, you will find the movie unbelievably ridiculous. As a casual moviegoer, you will find the dialogue corny, the action over-the-top, the hero invincible, and the villain and his minions a joke. As a reviewer I normally judge films with either a sense of practical logic or its relevance to the genre. During this movie, the superhero fan in me took over and I succumbed to its seduction.As an actor, Evans has justified his upgrade from a supporting role in 'Fantastic Four' to the titled lead in this movie. He has outgrown the brash ego of the Human Torch to a lovable underdog whose real driving force is his spirit of patriotism. Like Peter Parker is to Spiderman, Captain America's alter ego in Steve Rogers is a simple man who uses his gift for the greater good of his nation and shoulders that responsibility with the heart of a true hero. On the other hand, considering that every superhero must face an ever daunting and equally super villain, Hugo Weaving has failed to radiate either hatred or fear as Red Skull; this, arising from my high expectations of Weaving.Known for the CGI infused 'Jumanji' and 'Jurassic Park III', director Joe Johnston pulls off an otherwise decent superhero flick and has laid a strong foundation for things to come. Call it a prequel, re-boot or pilot – in its entirety, this film is a big teaser for a multi-billion dollar franchise, starting with 2012's 'The Avengers'. The ending scenes of both 'Thor' and 'The First Avenger' has Nick Furry (Samuel L. Jackson) hint at just that. For superhero fans, 2012 (if we live through it) will have plenty of such movies. While Superman and Spiderman are all set for a re-boot, the Batman franchise concludes with 'The Dark Knight Rises'. In all this, 'The Avengers' is rumored to become the motion picture event of the year. The credibility of that rumor strongly rests in the success of 'The First Avenger'. By the looks of it, this movie has outdone all preceding 2011 superhero flicks and is on track to hand over the baton to what is going to be an explosive yet highly competitive summer come 2012.",Null,39,66,7 September 2011
Bohemian Rhapsody," An uplifting and electrifying encore to some of Queen's best music and a salute to the man that made it all happen.
","Are you ready? Are you ready for this?
The world's population in 1985 was well over four billion people. That same year, close to two billion people across 150 countries witnessed one of the greatest performances in the history of live music. It would also be one of the last performances by British rock band Queen, led by singer, songwriter and the greatest frontman of all time - Freddie Mercury. That was Live Aid and that's old news now. Bohemian Rhapsody serves as a biopic into the short but brilliant life of Mercury, his music, his struggles as person and the choices he had to make at a time when society wasn't so liberal. Yet no matter what you know or how much you love the sound of their music, nothing can prepare you for the final twenty minutes, or the 20 most important minutes in Mercury's life. For every Gen X or pre-millennial watching this film, this is the closest any of us will come to seeing Freddie Mercury and Queen perform on stage. Again.The film begins and ends with Mercury in his iconic acid jeans and wife-beater vest at Live Aid. In between, we follow the transformation of Farrokh Bulsara from a shy baggage handler at Heathrow airport to the rock legend he would become. A brief and early segment tells us about his conservative Parsi-Indian upbringing, which ultimately serves as an important arc to the two sides of Freddie Mercury - the musical genius and the man in the closet. In retrospect, this is a very important part of Mercury's life that the film either gets right or terribly wrong. That's because the film is content in revealing Mercury's relationship with his girlfriend and then wife Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton). She was everything to him and the film respects that. But when Mercury gets seductive looks from other men, we are only given a hint of his confusion that questions his sexual orientation. As it seems, Bohemian Rhapsody has little interest in Mercury's personal life with other men and nothing more than mere implication. Instead, the focus is and where it should be - the camaraderie with bandmates Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon - their love, joy, hate and heartbreak during the course of Queen's ascent into the household name it is today.If Bohemian Rhapsody feels underdeveloped at times, it would be because many viewers may have been expecting a more detailed story behind Queen, the band's rapid rise to fame, and why their music continues to enjoy such longevity. While this part of the film feels patchy, with bits and pieces time stamped by years and concerts around the world, the film is really about Mercury's vision to write and produce music that was outrageous and outstanding, yet universally infectious. In the film, his lyrics and melodies come to him in epiphanies. It's a nice touch in trying to understand the brilliance behind his outrageously flamboyant stage persona, while also nodding to the fact that Mercury was known to be a shy introvert when not performing.As Mercury, Rami Malek nails every scene with commanding aplomb, while struggling to cover his buck teeth with his upper lip. Like Queen, it's a meteoric performance for Malek who gathered a large fan following on TV's Mr. Robot. There are others too, Ben Hardy as drummer Roger Taylor, Gwilym Lee as lead guitarist Brian May, and an unrecognizable Mike Myers as a record label executive who together add supporting characters aid the story. But even if the biopic doesn't add up with which, who and what came first, all credit goes to Malek for capturing and almost reveling in Mercury's dynamic and electric stage presence, yet equally childlike innocence. Ultimately, Bohemian Rhapsody is a celebration of Queen's music, but with focus on Mercury as the band's creator. If that means controversies are left out, then it also leaves Mercury's brilliance and conflicts obscured in mystery. And that's the best way to remember a legend with an incredibly diverse set of octaves.
'We will rock you', they said. They do and you better believe it. By the time you realise the end credits are rolling up, you'll find yourself hanging on the edge of your seat.",8,2,4,8 November 2018
Watchmen," Well crafted. Zack Snyder at his best.
","In a nutshell, my review for this move boils down to three words- Clever, complex and complete. Fresh on the heels of his unexpected smash hit '300', director Zack Snyder outdoes himself with this comic book adaptation. Unfortunately for Snyder, Christopher Nolan had the upper-hand with 2009's box-office bomb, 'The Dark Knight'. Even so, Snyder's work here is a painstaking and well crafted movie that is targeted at a mature audience.The story is adapted from Alan Moore's independent comic book by the same name with acquisition by DC Comics for a full blown screenplay. Through the opening credits, we are introduced to caped vigilantes of the 1930s and 1940s. Calling themselves the Watchmen, most of them are now retired after having helped the US government through the Vietnam War and averting the Cuban Missile Crises. Hmmm, so this is where X Men: First Class got its inspiration. After the John F Kennedy assassination and ensuing public outcry, the Watchmen are now disbanded and living on their own. With each receiving proper introductions and ample screen time, they are Edward Blake AKA the Comedian, Walter Kovacks AKA Rorschach, Daniel Dreiberg AKA Nite Owl, Adrian Veidt AKA Ozymandias, Laurie Jupiter AKA Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan, the only former member with immense superpowers. Following the murder of the Comedian, Rorschach gets in touch with Nite Owl, Dr. Manhattan (now living with Silk Spectre II) and Ozymandias trying to warn each that former members of the Watchmen are being assassinated. With ties to the government and having put so many criminals behind bars, it is easy to see why anyone would want them dead. While Rorschach and Nite Owl investigate the Comedian's death, Dr. Manhattan and Silk Spectre realizes problem with their relationship with Manhattan distancing himself from humanity. In the meanwhile, the doomsday clock is ticking with the world bracing for nuclear war between the United States and the Soviets. But with the Watchmen retired, unwanted and stalked by a mysterious assassin, who will now save the world from total annihilation?Set in 1985 with Richard Nixon running his third term as president of the United States, this film is a clever analogy to the cold war crises of the mid 1980s. The essence of the plot is seamlessly grafting historical events with fiction, resulting in a very plausible story. Once again, kudos to Snyder for breaking out a movie other directors and producers have tried and abandoned since 1986. Their failure can be vindicated by the fact that the story itself is intricate enough to adapt on screen. Then there is mandatory character development, alternate history, and the current film making technology that was lacking 25 years ago. Although this film offers ample doses of high-end visual effects and CGI, the main focus is on character development, making this a true character driven film. As such, acting is flawless from a star studded lineup. Most notable are Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl, Malin Ậkerman as Silk Spectre II and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Dr. Manhattan is entirely CGI rendered but voiced by Billy Crudup. Special mention also goes to Robert Wisden as Richard Nixon and Carla Gugino as Silk Pectre.All aspects considered, Snyder has truly cut a niche out for himself. But as I mentioned before, this film was overshadowed by 'The Dark knight' because Watchmen is not intended for a teenage audience and is not your run-of-the-mill superhero caper. Yes, the story is engaging from start to finish, but it's the detail that has gone into the production. Cinematography is top notch and Snyder's frequent use of overhead angles of filming adds an extra touch to the look and feel. There is also something unique about combining slow-motion in heavy rain, and this is complemented by an excellent score. The soundtrack on the other hand takes you back to the 70s and 80s and is a perfect choice for the setting. However, be warned that violence is extreme and brutal. Like '300', Snyder is unforgiving with blood, gore and guts.What is stopping me from rating this film with 5 stars is the unnecessary inclusion of over 20 minutes of animation, which I find has no relation to the already complex plot. Then again, my review is based on the 'director's ultimate cut' available only on Blu-ray Disk. Had I watched the DVD version containing the 'Director's cut', I would have rated this film with every star it deserves. I also thought the ending was a bit disappointing in comparison to the rest of the story. But overlooking this inclusion, watching this movie is an event in itself, not because of the two and half hour of engagement time, but due to its epic scale in storytelling. For a truly uninterrupted viewing experience, turn your phones silent and watch this in one sitting.As a Zach Snyder fan, I eagerly await his next release in re-booting the Superman saga. After what he did for this film, it is just a matter of time before Snyder grabs the whole superhero genre by the horns. For what it's worth, 'Man of Steel' is rumored to have both Snyder and Nolan working together. Will wonders never cease!",8,3,6,11 July 2011
Baby Driver," As homage to classic heist films, Baby Driver starts exceptionally well but ends with a whimper.
","When you have bank robberies, armed gunmen wearing caricature masks and fast getaway cars, you are most certainly watching a heist movie. Add music in every scene, a bit of old fashioned misty-eyed romance, oddball characters thrown into a madcap mix and you are now watching Edger Wright's Baby Driver - a kinetic, off-the-wall action comedy that starts with a bang, but before you know it, is gone in 60 minutes. Everything after is like the recoil of a gun ejecting a spent cartridge.The first hour is so much fun, it contains every reason you would recommend watching this film. Even so, the first two minutes is all the viewer needs to get hooked in. Written and directed by Wright, the film begins with infectious energy soon after we are introduced to baby-faced Ansel Elgort as the titular getaway driver for a group of armed robbers organised by Doc (Kevin Spacey). He is called Baby because he is the youngest member of the crew and basically a kid. Baby also suffers from permanent hearing damage owing to a tragic accident, so must listen to music to drown out a constant hum in his ears. Seen through Baby's perspective, everything that happens in the film is synchronised to his music. Be it gun shots, doors opening and closing, tyres screeching, dialogue, and every other sound effect is seamlessly integrated into the soundtrack and camera-work with stupendous attention to detail. And as soon as we are hooked to the music, Wright moves swiftly into the plot specifics – Baby owes Doc one last job, after which he is free to pursue his own life. But as we have seen in previous heist films, there is no such thing as a last job. Once you're in, there is no way out. Despite his obligation to Doc, Baby is a nice guy and sure enough things get complicated when he meets love interest Deborah (Lily James), a waitress at a local diner. They plan a perfect getaway but with the arrival of a new stick-em-up crew, ala Bonny and Clyde couple Buddy and Darling (John Hamm and Eiza González), and trigger- happy badass Bats (Jamie Fox), all hell breaks loose. What ensues is a roller-coaster, edge-of-your seat thrill ride all the way but is it the best from visionary director Wright as early reviews seem to say? Including Shawn of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, all of Wright's six films to date have been wildly entertaining action comedies with clear love for genre films that came before. Baby Driver is no different in that it is a love letter to some of the greatest heist films from Hollywood (how many references to heist films can you spot in this review?). The car chase scenes for example are non CGI rendered, meaning actual stuntmen were used in white-knuckle maneuvering that resembles chase scenes from the original The Italian Job. But while the film could have remained a simple heist movie (where inevitably the last heist is always botched), Wright's story gets muddled with grand themes of loss and love heals all wounds, and then turns into a farce with a hammy ending where characters refuse to die. No pun intended. Compared to some of the big titles opening this summer, Baby Driver is much smaller in scale and budget, but still manages to stand its ground as an exhilarating action-comedy with nothing but the will to entertain. Add to that a fantastically assembled soundtrack fused with almost every scene and we are essentially watching a musical on wheels. There is also Wright's unique sense of pulp cinema style oozing in every scene, but despite all that has gone into making Baby Driver an interesting and fun film (including a well assembled cast), the biggest downfall is the lack of any relatable or lovable character. That, and the fact that the film opens on an octane high but simmers down to a whimper towards the end undermines what could have been a scorcher of a film this summer.",6,1,3,19 July 2017
Justice League," Although long time in the making, Justice League ultimately proves to be unnecessary.
","After years of speculation and uncertainty, DC Films' answer to Marvel's Avengers is finally here. But is it necessary? Fans, movie pundits, studio suits and everyone else in between can argue over this for years. The answer is irrelevant, and given the outcome, even rhetorical. As awkward as it sounds, Justice League - with no less than five latex clad superheroes - is the finale to director Zack Snyder's trilogy (following Man of Steel and Batman Versus Superman) but also distances itself from the previous two by trying to fix common complaints about those films - too dark and no spunk, we said. Well guess what; The makers behind Justice League heard our protests and made this film as bright as day. There's also some humour that will draw a genuine smirk from all but the sternest viewer or harshest critic. That's it. Everything else is an incoherent, incomplete, unguided, unwanted mess. The problems are plenty because that mess is all over the place. On one level, the world is still mourning the death of Superman. Like the previous film, Biblical analogies are apparent, but only if you care to look below the surface and only if you know what to look for; which is why a genuine question in this film is whether or not a God can be resurrected, and if so, should that happen. Then the tone shifts to familiar territory. On another level, the planet is about to be destroyed by Steppenwolf (played by Ciarán Hinds by bizarrely imitating Liam Neeson), an alien general done up with bad CGI. And then there is Bruce Wayne who claims his superhero ability is being rich. If that isn't a stab at Tony Stark, is it meant to be funny? After hobbling along with these one-liners for an hour, the titular roster is setup for the first and bombastic clash of superpowers. But by this time we are essentially watching two movies, and it won't take long before it dawns on the viewer that something isn't quite right. Or not altogether there. Even as alarming as that sounds, there is yet another movie which struggles to break through the superficial cracks of the main movie, and this is probably why Justice League is almost forgivable - The idea of a team of misfits trying to fit, (which made The Avengers hugely entertaining) seems to find some footing in this film too. Ezra Miller's Barry Allen, AKA The Flash, holds a candle to Tom Holland's Peter Parker. For better or worse, Miller even has a lot more pep than Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne and Batman combined! Another welcome addition is Jason Momoa as the brooding Aquaman, and although there's something fishy about his supersonic speed, there's not much else explored.When it works, it's because of the camaraderie between some of the characters. Along with Miller's Flash, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is almost always one of them. Consistency, though, is not a strong point in this film. In the end, and despite being salvageable, Justice League is content with breeding familiarity. This includes a villain that is both weak and boring, and with an agenda that we have seen one too many times. As for Ray Fisher's Cyborg, there's little doubt that anyone will remember how and why he is a member of the League. While all this is still forgivable given Snyder's tragic personal loss during filming, the biggest undoing is a superhero film unsure of what it wants to be. Which again asks – was this necessary?",5,17,34,15 November 2017
Man of Steel," A justified reboot
","Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, there is a climactic scene just before the end of KILL BILL: Vol.2. In poetic fashion, the main villain, Bill, narrates why Superman is unlike any other superhero: Every superhero wears a costume or a powered suit that enables them to become invincible. On the other hand, Superman disguises himself as Clark Kent. Clark Kent is the costume. This costume blends in with human frailties of doubt, despair, weakness and cowardice. At the time, Tarantino had no way of knowing what influence that philosophy would have on the mythology behind the most iconic superhero in pop culture. If Tarantino's philosophy is merely an iceberg of thought, the ethos in MAN OF STEEL is an entire glacier by comparison. Penned by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, scripters behind THE DARK KNIGHT trilogy, the mythology here is taken very seriously right from the opening scene on Krypton. Kal is born to Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) and Jor-El (Russell Crowe), despite age old Kryptonian laws that forbid natural conception. The birth takes place during Krypton's crisis as a doomed planet, alongside a political uprising led by General Zod (Michael Shannon). As the last son of Krypton, Kal, son of the House of El, is dispatched to Earth where he must fulfill the aspirations of his parents while upholding the nobility of his alien race. In narrating his upbringing on Earth, director Zack Snyder pans back and forth between the adult Kal-El (Henry Cavill) and specific moments during his childhood. Through short flashbacks, we see his parents' prophesies materialise as Kal-El comes to terms with powers beyond his own comprehension, even as he is rendered an outcast amongst humans. But struggling through an imploding identity crises, his values of integrity and compassion are installed by his adoptive human parents, Martha and Jonathan Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner). These values are put to the test when Zod invades Earth with no greater goal than total annihilation of the human race.Before I get to some of the film's glaring faults, let me just say that MAN OF STEEL is a respectable attempt as an origins story. Hordes of Superman fans disappointed by Brian Singer's SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006) will be pleased to find Snyder's version meatier without many of the bone fragments found in the indigestible predecessor. Running at 143 minutes, Snyder appears to be in no rush to have our caped crusader perform his supersonic duties to save mankind. Instead, there are detailed plot arch's re-written for this movie that makes us want to care enough for another Superman adventure despite the failed 2006 debacle. This gives us a lot to mull over because viewers as well as the mythology are given a second chance to connect, and herein lies the precise reason why this 2013 reboot is necessary. How this works out is a unique feat in itself because for the first time since the 1978 original, the story stays true to its sci-fi myth (if you overlook some excess use of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo) rather than the recent trend in bombastic action fantasy. Although this may not measure up to present day expectations, purists have reason to believe that this is not a halfhearted attempt at reviving the Superman Saga. Is MAN OF STEEL the film of the year? On a subjective level I would have liked to think so. Then again, I would be lying if I say this film is without technical problems. Snyder's shaky camera work is an assault on the senses, especially when viewing this film in 3D. And while the story does have a dark premise I didn't get why Snyder had to tone down the color palate, leaving the viewer between thirty shades of grey and twenty shades of blue. On that note, the Zod squad is almost monochromatic but at least their armor has a lot more visual spunk over Tony Stark's tin can. In giving a new spin to the word 'Blockbuster', action scenes are plenty and mostly bloodless. But while Snyder restrains his penchant for slow-motion scenes, there is an exposition on battle sequences, in addition to fight scenes that become repetitive. All considered, I simply did not feel the 'wow factor' despite emotional moments amplified by Hans Zimmer's background score. What the makers got right is the casting, including heart-tugging performances by Costner and Lane. And taking over the titular mantle from Brandon Routh, British actor Cavill's Kent is a near perfect recluse opposite Amy Adams' Louis Lane – a livewire reporter who becomes Kent's eventual love interest. I say 'eventual' because their chemistry is virtually nonexistent until the very end. Now that a spark is ignited, there is always hope that the sequel to this prequel can go only one way, and that is up, up and away!",7,0,1,28 August 2013
The Revenant," The Revenant is a visceral engagement of the senses and an exhaustive experience throughout.
","Evidently, director Alejandro González Iñárritu is not one to rest on his laurels. Having won last year's Best Picture and Best Director for Birdman, I can't even imagine what sort of pressure Iñárritu underwent to remain consistent but it shows. Painstakingly crafted and expertly told, The Revenant is a visceral engagement of the senses unlike anything we have seen from the director. Co-scripted by Iñárritu, this partly based true story tells of frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and a group of fur trappers set in the icy wilderness of 1820s South Dakota. In a breathtaking opening montage, Glass and his hunting party are ambushed by Native-American Arikara Indians. Outnumbered and chased by the Arikara, the group decides to return to base with Glass being the navigator. Expedition member John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) disagrees with the plan and an instant enmity is born. Between increasing hostility on their way back, Glass is attacked by a grizzly bear in what has to be one of the most brutal, terrifying and uncut scenes in a film. Having barely survived the attack, and certain that Glass won't make it back alive, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) orders Fitzgerald to lead the expedition back. Glass's half Native-American son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and another young man Bridger (Will Poulter) are tasked with staying behind and ensuring a proper burial. But when Fitzgerald volunteers to stay behind too, it's obvious to the viewer that no good deed can from this. Thus begins a traumatic tale of survival but also revenge when Glass learns of Fitzgerald's heinous intentions. At little over 150 minutes, this is a long film and not for everyone. From cauterizing his wounds to what Glass must do to survive, Iñárritu's remarkable achievement in this film is his relentless method of conveying the unthinkable. Between extreme cold conditions and eating raw meat, this is DiCaprio in his most challenging delivery. And although he doesn't say much, his role is physically demanding to such an extent, they might as well hand him an Oscar for exhibiting a genuine impetus to do just about anything. But DiCaprio is just one component in an overall strikingly beautiful film.While the sheer audio-visual experience is consistently mind-blowing, it comes down to Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography as the single most significant aspect of this film. From tracking shots of landscapes to a character's widening pupils by a camp fire, the soul of this film is undeniably in its visual appeal. Such is the astounding nature of his shots that the only other way to describe it is as if the lens is omnipresent. After consecutive Academy Awards for Gravity and Birdman, it won't be surprising if Lubezki is in for hat-trick. As Iñárritu's most ambitious film, The Revenant doesn't disappoint and even with its somber tone and length, there isn't a single dull moment. If anything, the entire film is an exhaustive experience but positively riveting, terrifying, and haunting – like something that has returned from the dead and won't go back.",8,0,3,7 January 2016
Split," Split not only has Shyamalan back on the saddle but also rewards fans for their patience in his return to form.
","What a terrific comeback for Shyamalan! Many have been vocal that horror writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has been on a downward spiral after having peaked with Unbreakable, his very own superhero origins film. Split sees the continuation of Shyamalan's tryst with the supernatural but also a long awaited rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to resurface. While his last film - The Visit - was predictable but entertaining, Split underscores his storytelling prowess with the high level of creativity that made him a household name in contemporary horror.Yet fans will concur that Split isn't just a comeback either, rather a tactical setup of Shyamalan's very own cinematic universe. Put literally, the film is about a person with multiple personalities where each personality speaks collectively in full awareness of the rest. Although main character Kevin is said to exhibit 23 personalities, we see just a handful during most of the film. There's Barry, a New York fashionista, Hedwig, a goofy 9-year-old, and darker personalities Patricia and Dennis. Calling themselves The Horde, the latter two have influenced the abduction of three high school girls as a ritualistic sacrifice for the 24th personality often referred to as 'The Beast'. The girls have limited time before The Beast is unleashed and although paralysed by fear, their escape depends on protagonist Casey's (Anya Taylor-Joy) proactive deconstruct of the good and evil personalities that reside in Kevin. To her advantage and through revelatory flashbacks, we learn that this wouldn't be the first time Casey would confront a monster.If Edward Norton's dual personalities was chilling in his debut film Primal Fear, wait till you get a load of James McAvoy in what is simply an outstanding performance of versatility (or should I say two dozen performances in one film?). More than just a demanding role to pull off, McAvoy's broad range in this film has also elevated what could have been a familiar antagonist into a nerve wrecking supervillain. Which is why Shyamalan's so called signature twist ending is almost astounding. To be honest there isn't an actual twist in the story, but the ending is an unexpected but seamless integration into a sort of trilogy that will have most viewers gob smacked. It's an inside joke and almost as if Shyamalan is asking if we have you been watching closely, but also an extremely rewarding Easter egg for every true fan of the man. Welcome back Mr. Shyamalan!",8,174,325,6 February 2017
Hugo," Who says Scorsese was all about mobsters?
","If I am allowed to be a little subjective here, I can tell you that Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese are two of my favorite directors, but for different reasons. In terms of what they do for cinema, I can't think of a similarity in their films, except that they are film makers with passion, vision and dedication. At the time of writing this, Spielberg and Scorsese are at opposite ends of the rope, with the Oscar for 'Best Picture' in the middle. As directors, it becomes irrelevant who wins. However, when you consider Scorsese's 'Hugo' with Michel Hazanavicius' 'The Artist', even seasoned critics will find it hard to choose between the two. Up until the point when I actually watched these two films, I was, like a million others, questioning the choice of 'Best Picture' nominees for the 2012 Academy Awards. Before I tell you why 'Hugo' is a prime contender, let me say that for a year that was not really the best in cinema, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in my opinion, has considered the heart and soul of cinema in comparison to what cinema has evolved into today.In comparison to his previous films, Scorsese fans are in for a totally different experience with this film. Based on Brian Selznick's novel, 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret', we follow the titled character's adventures in repairing an automaton, a mechanized invention left behind by his deceased father. Orphaned and living alone, 12 year-old Hugo lives within the walls of a Paris railway station, maintaining various clocks and stealing food for existence. Fixated at repairing the automaton, Hugo has to retrieve a book that shows how, having lost it to a bitter old man called Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley). Befriending Georges' goddaughter Isabelle (Chloë Moretz), Hugo begins a journey of discovery and quest, but must do everything he can to evade capture by a pesky railway inspector hell-bent on sending him to an orphanage.As a director and film maker, Scorsese has not only outdone himself, he has severely raised the bar in the art of storytelling. Nominations for art direction and cinematography are easily justified with visually stunning aesthetics of 1930's Paris. Clearly, production design is one of the best; a feat that I feel has outdone the art direction in 'Anonymous'. Character portrayals are another big tick mark when considering the story revolves round the lives of just a few key people. With just under three films to his credit, Asa Butterfield is impressive in his titled yet heartwarming role as a boy saddened by the loss of his father, but goes on to become a catalyst in awakening self-worth in a stranger. Reciprocating this kinship is Kingsley in another fine performance, where his Georges Méliès is constantly evolving throughout the movie. Playing a World War I veteran turned railway inspector, Sacha Baron Cohen is the comic relief, albeit with an antagonistic touch, but one that is a far cry from 'Borat' and the revolting 'Bruno'. Good choice in casting and I hope Cohen is seen in similar roles, given his unique talent as a comedian. Also nicely done are roles from Chloë Moretz and Helen McCrory, with shorts from Christopher Lee and Jude Law.For a family adventure movie, this film is structurally intact except for a glaring flaw. Set as a period piece in 1930's Paris, there is hardly any French dialogue, and worse, absolutely no French accent from any of the characters. Am I missing something here? Why go to great lengths to make an epic movie in '30s France but have all actors sport a British accent? This flaw aside, every other aspect of the movie works in favor of making this a remarkable film. Apart from stunning visuals, fine acting and a well narrated story, the heart of this film lies in the homage it pays towards movies as an art form. Call it a movie within a movie; its essence stems from celebration of life and realization of dreams, through a medium we love so much – The movies.",8,3,5,21 February 2012
Warrior," Finally, my 5 star film of 2011!!
","Personally, I have always maintained that 'Rocky' 1&2 are Sylvester Stallone's best movies; not because these movies paved the future for Stallone, but due to its huge underdog factor. Everyone loves a good underdog story and this is also why 'Rocky' has always ranked within the top 10 on my list of favorite movies. Having said that, I now see a serious contender to one of my favorite movies of all time. Just twenty minutes into this movie and I started to get the feeling that this is no ordinary fight movie. In fact, it is unlike any other fight movie I have seen; but more on that later. We are first introduced to Tommy (Tom Hardy) as he visits his father, Paddy (Nick Nolte), after a 14 year hiatus. This opening scene is critical to the film as it sets the tone, pace and foundation for solid characterization. A former alcoholic, Paddy seeks forgiveness for his abusive past, but Tommy has no interest in reconciling with his estranged father. Tommy believes he has a shot at winning the title in a Mixed Martial Arts tournament and wants nothing else but to be trained by his father. Elsewhere, Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton), a family man and high school teacher faces eviction if he continues to default on his home mortgage. A former UFC fighter, Brendon resorts to street fighting for money, but is shortly suspended by school authorities due to his afterhour's reputation. Left with no other choice, and with the help of an old friend (Frank Grillo), Brendan starts training again and quickly gains public favor as a local underdog vying for the title. Meanwhile, Tommy rises as an undisputed fighter but is not after the glory of winning. His motive for winning becomes apparent during the course of the movie and it stands out as a truly noble gesture. Do you see what is happening here? Written, produced and directed by Gavin O'Connor, the plot becomes an emotional roller-coaster ride when both fighters embark on a collision course. To avoid spoilers, I am omitting a vital plot development in this review. Although many other critics have not found this to be a plot twist, I feel it is a surprise that adds a powerful oomph to the film's emotional tug. Even so, the first half hour is all you need to see this segment emerging. Unlike other fight movies, there is no antagonist here — two fighters, each respectable, with individually justifiable motives to win the mega bucks tournament. This is where O'Connor's story plays with your mind— making it very hard to choose sides; and then some. Production values in this movie are one of the leading best I have seen for a year that had barely a handful of top notch movies. This includes a phenomenal screenplay co-written by O'Connor, eating up over an hour of runtime in building impeccable character detail in Tom, Brendan and Paddy. More than anything else, this movie is a heart-wrenching cry for redemption and O'Connor more than drives that message home. There are plenty of caged, yet brutal fight scenes, but these are strategically placed in the second half. Fight choreography and cinematography are astounding without any apparent visual effects while always giving the viewer a ring-seat perspective. Sound editing is another area of technical excellence, especially when you hear the very realistic yet sickening sound of a fist pounding wet flesh. Casting and acting are easily one of the best of 2011. After this, Hardy and Edgerton are going places; for sure. However, not since 'Prince of Tides' (1991) or 'Affliction' (1997), have I seen Nolte in a role that begs for an Oscar nomination. Thorough, authentic and soulful are the words that come to mind. I normally reserve a 5 star rating for a maximum of two movies a year. Even that is being generous when considering that all major award systems can crown only one movie as the best film of the year. Yes, 'Warrior' is not perfect with its perceivable flaws; but it does a great job in avoiding typical Hollywood traps and clichés too. At some point it can even be compared to 'The Wrestler', 'The Million Dollar Baby' and 'The Fighter'— all Oscar nominated movies with a central theme of redemption. It also screams 'Spartacus' (1960) towards the end. However, 'Warrior' is in a class of its own due to the standard it has created while raising the bar in this genre, and ends up as a full-bodied multi-genre movie. Right from the start, the movie trades one-two punches with the viewer. Be prepared though, for that heart-tugging, teary eyed haymaker in the end. This is exactly what makes this movie palpable to the hardest of critics or even viewers who loathe blood sport. Aside from recommending this movie as a must-see, I can vouch that this is easily one of my top 5 movies of 2011.",10,0,3,8 January 2012
We're the Millers," Sticks out like a sore tes...thumb.
","What do they say about too many cooks? WE'RE THE MILLERS is a comedy penned by four screenwriters. Two of them, Bob Fisher and Steve Faber also wrote the occasionally hilarious WEDDING CRASHERS. The other two writers, Sean Anders and John Morris were responsible for the tasteless and unnecessary HOT TUB TIME MACHINE. And putting all this together is director Rawson Marshall Thurber, whose best movie so far is the mediocre brat pack DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY. See where I'm going with this? To make a long story short, WE'RE THE MILLERS is a no-brainer comedy filled with moments that lack taste and tact. But if you prefer to switch-off from reality, especially after a bad day at work, there are plenty of insane tidbits to make you laugh. On the short end of the stick, the film does have one redeeming quality and that is the casting. Last seen together in the not so horrible HOBBIBLE BOSSES, Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston are pitted together as neighbors who don't get along. In fact Sudeikis' David doesn't get along with any of his neighbors – Kenny (Will Poulter) an 18-year-old nerd who hasn't even kissed a girl, Casey (Emma Roberts) a homeless Goth-chick, and Rose (Aniston) a debt ridden stripper. Comprising of chaotic moments strung together in the form of a road-trip, the over marinated premise has David downgraded from small-time drug dealer to a mule. After losing his cash and stash, David owes his boss big time and is forced to smuggle 'a smidge and a half' of dope from Mexico into Denver. Sure enough, David does the most sensible thing and recruits the aforementioned neighbors to masquerade as the titular family on vacation. What his boss Brad (Ed Helms of HANGOVER fame) fails to do is define the word 'Smidge', resulting in a faux pas road trip with the most dysfunctional family onboard a RV.While the setup might seem original at first, the gags and corny one-liners catch up to leave you with a high level of clichéd predictability. More often than not, the Millers find themselves flying out of the frying pan and into the fire due to unexpected predicaments. These situations are frequent but also sugar coated with coincidental salvation in the nick of time. Hence, whatever situation lies waiting, the Millers will find a way around it or through it, but in a manner that will leave you either chuckling in delight or grimacing in disgust. Each of the actors playing the Millers is also tasked with a characteristic personality trait that underscores the film's R-rated content advisory. Somehow, this is built into the array of jokes while also allowing the audience to root for at least one of these misfits. While Sudeikis is his goofy self all throughout, Roberts meets her match with an Eminem wannabe called Scottie P. and Aniston switches from exotic dancer to suburban housewife in the blink of an eye. On the other hand, British actor Poulter can be credited for some of the heavier laughs even if these scenes are literally made of below-the-belt humor. Thurber keeps things moving, if not alternated by moments straight out of a Farrelly Brothers movie. Some characters are in just for kicks (Luis Guzman as an improvised Mexican cop) while others appear contrived and repetitive (Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn as a weird pair of swingers). For this reviewer, the best laughs are the most natural and these are saved for the end-credits sequence where actors are themselves. Did I mention Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper? If all else fails, watching Aniston do her thing is worth the price of admittance alone.",6,0,2,28 August 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Nothing is ever impossible in a Mission Impossible film.
","Industry pundits are gob smacked and they have every reason to be. What started as an over the top action spectacle has turned into a refined espionage thriller, albeit still a tall tale, but close on the heels of recent Bond films. Now in its fifth installment, and 20 years later, the Mission Impossible franchise has finally found its niche by almost entirely abandoning the cheese.In some ways, Rogue Nation could also have the edge over Daniel's Craig's Bond flicks when considering the latter's tradition for forced romance and prototype gadgetry. None of that here, and thankfully, no time inflating fillers either. That said, there isn't much of a story either and John Le Carre fans will eat through the plot before you can say 'I spy'. Instead, Rogue Nation offers the best thrills in the series where the ride has prominence over the destination. For now, all you need to know is that the IMF has found its diabolical equal in The Syndicate, a shadow organization responsible for orchestrating devastating geo-political terror attacks around the world. But just when Ethan Hunt discovers their leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), CIA director Hunley (Alec Baldwin) disbands the IMF, citing unorthodox engagement tactics. Working from the shadows, and double crossed by double agents, Hunt does what he does best – a series of impossible missions that leaves us breathless.Reprising his role as Hunt, it would only be half-truth to say that Rogue Nation is all Tom Cruise. But with Cruise actually performing his own stunts, it's fair to say that the success of this film emanates from his unmatched delivery as an aging action hero. Unless Cruise is nourished from a secret fountain of youth, doing all that he does at the age of 53 is in itself an incredible feat and worth the price of admittance. The other half emanates from insane white-knuckle action paused only by Hitchcockian moments of suspense. Flanking adrenaline packed car and bike chases are two nail biting scenes – one takes place above the stage of a Viennese opera and the second in an underwater vault which appears to be shot in one take. Both scenes are insanely pulse pounding and precisely why this installment is the best in the series.That casting takes a backseat could be a dent in the overall making of this film. Although Simon Pegg is back for comic relief and he delivers, Jeremy Renner's inclusion serves no purpose at any point during the plot. Additionally, Harris as the villain is more annoying than threatening, and visibly weak in comparison to Philip Seymour-Hofmann's mesmerising delivery in Mission Impossible III. Even so, none of this diminishes from the sheer entertainment factor of this film and precisely why the franchise has been accumulating a massive fan base.",7,1,5,27 August 2015
Dunkirk," Dunkirk is a technical marvel and a masterclass in visual narration from a director on the threshold of greatness.
","Initial thoughts on Christopher Nolan's war epic - Dunkirk - seems to suggest that this is another exercise in the director's pedigree for mind bending narratives. Three perspectives over land, sea and air occur at relatively different timelines but converge towards the end. That's typical Nolan for you but the nod to M. C. Escher's infinite levels of perceived reality is replaced with a sense of urgency from the very first scene to the last. In between is an exceptionally told and painstakingly assembled jaw-dropping spectacle on heroism. While both the heroes and horrors of WWII have been a Hollywood stage setter for decades, Dunkirk is all about heroes. And there are plenty from civilian pleasure craft owners to daring RAF fighter pilots to the unsung but courageous few in between. Winston Churchill himself has a mention in the film for hoping to save 30,000 Allied troops stranded on the shores of the titular French coast. What Churchill envisioned, however, was just a tenth of the actual numbers that needed urgent evacuation. Mainly comprising of British, French and Belgian soldiers, over 300,000 Allied troops were stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk. With the Nazi war machine closing in from the mainland, and sea and air routes blocked by U-boats and the elite German Luftwaffe, they would need a miracle to get home. What happens is literally history and although common knowledge, Nolan's retelling, albeit with a little bit of reimagining, is a deeply atmospheric and nerve-wrecking account of one the greatest rescue initiatives in history. If the intention was to create a frantic race for survival, Nolan, along with Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (who was also DP for Interstellar) and legendary music composer Hans Zimmer not only succeeds first hand, but in the process, elevates this gruelling history lesson into a pressure cooked combat thriller. Yet unlike Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan - one of the goriest war films ever - Nolan keeps bloodshed to the bare minimum, which itself is a rare feat for a war film of such a scale. CGI is also minimised in favour of the real thing - filming on location at Dunkirk, dogfights using real spitfires in actual flight over the English Channel, and shooting mostly on large format film. Also scarce are character dialogue which immensely add to the thickening mood of isolation and despair, until it reaches an overwhelming sense of hopelessness. There isn't much of a plot either but the on-screen fear, suffocation, claustrophobia, PTSD, that is absorbed and felt by the viewer is THE defining factor that makes Nolan's narrative seminal. Neither are the few characters that are given some importance fleshed out either. There's Kenneth Branagh's top brass naval commander and an unnamed foot soldier surviving calamity after nightmarish calamity on the beach over a period of one week. Meanwhile, a yachter played by Mark Rylance tries to reach said beach during the course of a day. And strapped in the cockpit of a spitfire is Tom Hardy's pilot gunning down the enemy, but compressed to within an hour. That's all there is to the plot, but then again, Nolan's screenplay isn't really a full bodied story and perhaps not entirely intended as such.That's because Dunkirk, in its entirety, is a riveting narration on the mettle of men, and when these three 'skits' interlace with increasing frequency, you start to see a collage that is beyond the realms of a typical war film; On a fundamental level it's all about endurance, determination, survival, self-sacrifice and then an rousing level of patriotic unity that transcends the preservation of values and culture of the Allied nations. That philosophy aside, this film is a cinematic wonder in both its technical components and its artistic range. Hoytema's deft camerawork, for instance, is deadeye with the details which are often off-centre or in the background or in the immediate foreground of the screen. And given Nolan's minimalist approach to dialogue, watching this film on an IMAX screen just adds to the gorgeous detail of the narrative. Zimmer's nonstop pulsation of a score in tandem with the sound design and editing does the rest of the talking. The lack of emotional undertones or a story that reaches fruition might be frowned upon by some. But it isn't required in this film. The craft and technique employed could make this Nolan's most intimate film yet. Perhaps one of the greatest war films ever made where almost everyone on screen is a hero in his own right.",9,1,2,10 January 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," Why fix it if it ain't broke...
","While many people are asking 'why reboot a movie just five years later', many others are still saying that Sam Raimi's trilogy swung into a brick wall after Spiderman 3 (2007). By the looks of it, this is not just a remake, but the re-boot of a new Marvel franchise. Is it needed? Well, if 2012 is the year of the superheroes, then more the merrier. Right? Personally, I thought the whole movie is one misplaced pun with Marc Webb stepping in as the new director. The story however, is not new. As a high school teenager, Peter parker (Andrew Garfield) has issues of his own. Orphaned at a very young age, Peter has since lived with his uncle and aunt, but finds his parents' disappearance a hushed mystery. Additionally, he is bullied at school as a misfit and science geek. If all this were too much to bear, peer pressure blows a gasket when the inevitable happens – the bite of a genetically engineered spider that endows Peter with 'amazing' superhuman abilities. The rest, as any superhero aficionado will tell you, is history. That little synopsis should tell you that this is a remake that borrows, albeit heavily, from Raimi's screenplay that is just about 10 years old. For me this appears to be one major stumbling block. Sure, Webb spins his own yarn with little tidbits that seem to re-illustrate forgotten pages from our wall-crawler's Marvel origins; a web shooter, a bluer costume and some fancy fight moves to recall a few. Then there is the likable Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) instead of Mary Jane Watson, who by the way, has a fate that is altered for the movie but swapped less favorably by her father - NYPD Captain George Stacy (Dennis Leary).Fresh as it may look, a remake in such a short span of cinematic memory can only mean that Webb has gone in guns blazing, or, was made to be the sacrificial lamb by studio bosses, should the cash cow refuse to budge. But as it seems, it's not all bad once the action starts. Cinematography although not picture perfect, works well as a mega teaser for New York City. Thanks to some first-person camera work, we not only see some of New York's vantage points, but also what it must feel like to crawl over and swing through those skyscrapers. Again, this is fairly rewarding for viewers opting for the pricier 3D tickets, but look around and you may find that just about every major blockbuster is released in 2D, 3D, and IMAX. Did someone mention cash cow? For this reviewer, the highpoint of this reboot are the character renditions by Garfield and Stone, both individually and as a pair of love-struck teens. Probably one of the very few areas where Webb has the one up on Raimi is Garfield's bolder Peter Parker, with or without the costume; an instantly noticeable upgrade on Toby Maguire's timid and hesitant Parker. Of course, every super hero must do battle with a super villain and this is the cue for Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans), a scientific genius at Oscorp. If you asked me, Ifans does a better job as Dr. Connors as compared to when he turns into the reptilian humanoid called The Lizard. As literal as this may sound, the Lizard-man is the wrecking ball that manages to do more damage to the movie than any good at all. Perhaps I was the only gob smacked viewer in the auditorium, but my disbelief stems from my cemented opinion that the Lizard is a miniature (plasticky look and all) version of Godzilla and a bad replica at that. Seriously Webb? Ishirō Honda's 'Godzilla' all but tore through cinema screens in 1954 but that is no excuse not to have used over 40 years of technological advancements to give the Lizard a palpable look and feel.And so the answer to my question earlier remains a firm NO. There was no real need for this reboot given there was nothing really wrong with the preceding storyline. And trust me; we who love cinema are not short of celluloid memory. But now that we have a remake, Marc Webb can only redeem himself by bringing out a sequel that will win over the hoards of Sam Raimi fans. Including Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.",6,1,4,10 August 2012
Jackie," Jackie is a bone crushing account of grief and Natalie Portman's best lead role ever.
","It takes a few minutes to get used to Natalie Portman mimicking Jacqueline Kennedy's voice, but once you do, it becomes hypnotic like everything else in this film. Starting with those wailing violins followed by unflattering close-up cinematography, Jackie becomes a haunting experience and ultimately a crushing story about grief. As an English debut from Chilean director Pablo Larraín, Jackie is a revelatory character study on one of the most iconic personalities in US history. Yet until now, little has been made public about Jacqueline Kennedy other than her glamorous demeanor. Detailing the minutes and hours following her husband and President John F Kennedy's assassination, this film dwells deep into the newly widowed First Lady's psyche and it's a mangled mess from the get go. Between anger and anguish, she wants answers even as the transition of power flows from her dead husband to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson being sworn in as the new President. This is happening on board Air Force One, just two hours after the assassination in Dallas and on route to Washington DC. This scene would turn out to be one of the most iconic images (by White House photographer Cecil Stoughton) in political history yet one of the most powerful scenes in this film. We see Jackie with blood stains on her iconic pink suit, standing inches away from Johnson with his right arm raised in solemn oath of office. She is in a daze; the world spinning around her; her future intangible; and the traumatic thought that her husband was snuffed out without a legacy to the world. Bone-deep and harrowing, Jackie has a lot of these mesmerizing moments and right from the opening scene Larraín wastes no time in portraying the devastating aftermath of the assassination. This is seen in two perspectives – hers and a nation in shock, and takes place in time shifts that converge towards the end. From her perspective, the film is told as an interview with an unnamed journalist (Billy Crudup) that reveals her life as the First Lady, her opulent lifestyle at the White House, some background into the Kennedy family history including feisty exchanges with Bobby (Peter Sarsgaard as brother-in-law Robert Kennedy), that fateful day in the motorcade, being elbowed to the sidelines by the new administration, and the obsession with State level funeral preparations to match that of Abraham Lincoln. This is another fascinating part of the biopic that screenwriter Noah Oppenheim gets right – the strange coincidences linking slain Presidents John and Abraham, and even First Ladies Mary Todd and Jacqueline. While the interview itself is meant to be an exposé on who Jacqueline Kennedy was, it is also a revelation on how she wanted the world to remember her and her world often referred to as 'Camelot'. It is everything that was perfect to her and although she would reveal to a priest (John Hurt) that her husband was no saint, it was still a fairytale she could not let go of, not even when her children asked her about their father's death, not even when she loses her composure behind closed doors. These sequences are as dream-like for Jackie as it us for us, moving in and out of reality, back and forth between the interview and a fairytale gone terribly wrong, until we see her as an individual capable of bearing infinite pain. Driven by meticulous characterization, Portman is unmatched by any other role she has played before. While her role could have easily drowned in melodrama, Portman's grasp is the perfect balance in portraying a woman who has lost everything yet will not relinquish her dignity. With several long shots filling the screen with her face, there was no margin for error either yet cinematographer Stephane Fontaine captures every ounce of her emotional trauma flawlessly. Add to that a gut-wrenching score from Mica Levi (who also created that haunting score for Under the Skin) and era specific aesthetics, Jackie turns out to be a powerfully assembled collage of facts, feelings and fiction. But most of all, it's a version of Jacqueline Kennedy that we have never seen before, and perhaps a version that we were never meant to see.",10,7,15,28 December 2016
Inside Out," Inventively comical yet powerfully moving, Inside Out is a winner from the start and a masterpiece throughout.
","Ever been told never to let your emotions get the best of you? Now what if you could actually see and hear those emotions emote. Welcome to Inside Out, a remarkable animation that is as original and clever as it is compelling and poignant. Simply put, another masterpiece from Pixar/Disney's library of outstanding animations. From the Academy Award winning Toy Story franchise to the Academy Award winning Up (2009), the mechanism behind Pixar's storytelling prowess has always been its ability to engage children and adults simultaneously. Inside Out works pretty much the same way but on a whole new level that uses relatable metaphors to tell the story. Set inside the mind of young Riley (voice by Kaitlyn Dias), we follow her mood swings when her parents decide to move from snowy Minnesota to sunny San Francisco. Determining the outcome of her actions are emotions, each colour-coded and manifested as characters – bright and radiant Joy (Amy Poehler), blue Sadness (Phyllis Smith), purple Fear (Bill Hader), green Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and flaming red Anger (Lewis Black). While influencing Riley's decisions, these emotions also preserve her memories (based on her actions) in coloured orbs relating to a specific emotion. In turn, each stored memory (or core memory) shapes her personality. Everything happens in 'Headquarters' or Riley's consciousness where each of her emotions strive for control over her actions. So on her first day at a new school, Riley is overcome with 'mixed emotions', brought on by a struggle between Joy and Sadness. It's an astute moment in the film that literally defines the word 'nostalgia'. But then something goes wrong, sending dominant emotions Joy and Sadness into Riley's sub consciousness. Now left with just three emotions, Riley begins a dangerous descent into depression with Fear, Anger and Disgust wreaking havoc on her personality. Kicking the film into high gear is the ensuing roller-coaster ride where Joy and Sadness try to get back to Headquarters. It's also where we are introduced to other characters and instances residing in Riley's deepest memories. As such, prepare for Bing Bong (Richard Kind), Riley's imaginary friend and one of the most charming characters in the film, whose inclusion results in a pivotal yet heart wrenching plot point in the story. Such is the powerfully overwhelming nature of this film, often leaving us stranded between Riley's fondest memories and the manifestation of painful new ones as she grows older. Perhaps one of the greatest achievements of this film is the reiteration that the magic and innocence of youth will inevitably fade away, only to be replaced with the harsh and often cynical trappings of adult perceptions. It's the same reason why Santa Claus is nothing more than a childhood fantasy. Co-written and helmed by Up director Pete Doctor, Inside Out is packed with such metaphors and many more that adults will relate to. A thrilling segment where Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong must board a 'Train of Thought' to save Riley is just one of Doctor's clever puns, and as it turns out, comes loaded with comical shenanigans to keep younger viewers rollicking in their seats. Clearly, there's a lot of backend study into psychology and behavioral science, but the way it all unfolds on screen is the work of pure genius and the type that will leave you in awe – laughing one moment and speechless the next, while stifling a tear drop all through to the end.",10,7,33,5 August 2015
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Jackson does it again!
","If given the option of describing this movie in one word, in all modesty, I would call it 'Spectacular'. Then again, after the multi-award winning THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, how can you expect any less? THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is a fantasy adventure of such epic proportions, it takes an accomplished and acclaimed filmmaker to lead us on a grand adventure the likes of which we are yet to experience. Even so, as the first of three installments, this film lets us experience just one-third of the proverbial iceberg. And that's a good thing.Once again, adapting from J.R.R Tolkien's spellbinding tales of Middle-Earth, director Peter Jackson returns along with writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens in cinematically narrating an incredible adventure that is truly out of this world. Set as a prequel to THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, The Hobbit is adapted into a new trilogy of its own where chapter one, AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, begins with the decimation of the once prosperous land of Erebor by the dragon Smaug, followed by the savage and brutal Orcs. We are then introduced to young Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) a hobbit who lives alone but content with his eventless lifestyle. Bilbo's simple life changes the day he meets Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen reprising his role) and thirteen dwarfs led by Thorin (Richard Armitage), whose father was the slain king of Erebor. Together, they begin a perilous quest to reclaim Erebor and all its treasures from Smaug.As the first of three instalments, there were a lot of high expectations riding on this one and I'm happy to say that the director, the grand storyteller that he is, has gone and done it again. Whether you are a Tolkien fan or not, Jackson takes everything we loved about TLOTR trilogy and breathes new life into it. Not only is there tweaking, sanding, and upgrading of various hallmarks from the original trilogy, there are lots of cliff-hangers, frequent skirmishes, and dollops of humour throughout. There is so much happening at any given time that you just don't feel the film is almost three hours long. From the fast paced story to the humorous predicaments of our little on-screen friends, to the captivating score by Howard Shore, there is little chance of a viewer's attention drifting away. To begin with, the 3D effect is immersive when required, rather than having the audience bob and weave at the swing of every axe. After the mixed reception of THE LOVELY BONES, Jackson has probably learned a valuable lesson in limiting only the best moments in visual splendour; an aspect he nails in this movie.Just In case you were wondering, the best part of this prequel is just that it is one – it is a prequel in the most rewarding manner possible for fans of the original. Bilbo and his new found friends traverse various locations that are brought back from the original, but grander in scale and visual aesthetics thanks to returning cinematographer Andre Lesnie. This says a lot about the quality of art design that has gone into this film, from green carpeted landscapes to snow-capped peaks, and various mythical beasts in between. There are also a plethora of familiar characters from the previous films, some who even aide in giving this story a new spin. My favourite, and perhaps the highlight of the film, is the attention given to reintroducing Gollum the goblin and his dark kinship with the One Ring. If performance capture technology is the next best thing in films of such calibre, it is no surprise that Andy Serkis is the best in the industry. Having previously worked with Jackson as Gollum and in 2011's unbelievable RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, it's a matter of time before Serkis is duly recognised for his ground-breaking efforts in CGI. But without doubt, the film's greatest strengths are Freeman as Bilbo and McKellen as Gandalf. Freeman crackles with charisma in almost every scene, yet the transformation from a meek and insignificant hobbit to becoming the group's hero is remarkably seamless. Together with Gandalf, Freeman's Bilbo becomes the catalyst in establishing a brotherly bond with every other character – everyone just seemed to be having fun no matter what the situation. THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTEED JOURNEY does not appear to break new ground, but trust Peter Jackson to show the world how a prequel should be made. Although he has caught our attention again, I suspect the best is yet to come. Watch this space.",8,4,12,14 December 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Delightfully infectious, spontaneously funny and impeccably detailed, this is one of the best films of the year.
","2014 is yet to reach its half-way point but I think it's safe to say that we may have a winner already. Delightfully infectious, spontaneously funny and impeccably detailed, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the best films of the year and perhaps director Wes Anderson's best film yet.Also co-written by Anderson, the story is a baroque-styled narration, and a story within a story about the once opulent Budapest Hotel – a pink mansion set atop ice capped ridges in the fictional European Republic of Zubrowka. Going from modern day to 1968, the narration begins when an unnamed author (Jude Law) meets the owner, Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). The narration and perspective shifts to 1932, where the Grand Budapest is a luxurious hotel catering to the wealthy. Young Zero (Tony Revolori) has joined the hotel as the new bellboy and is taken under the wing of head concierge M Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). Gustav has an OCD for perfectionism, with work ethics that include seducing his richest guests – usually blonde older women. Madame D is one such guest but her mysterious death sets about a series of events that turns Gustav's world inside-out while simultaneously making him a legend in the process.Packed with incident after zany incident, Gustav and Zero's adventures fill most of the running time with a script that never ceases to astonish. Anderson's penchant for style and escapism exists, but this time his typical melancholy is replaced with plenty of madcap humour that turns out to be more whimsical than slapstick. And that's a good thing because there's also quite a few startling scenes of violence. Speaking of which, the backdrop is pre WWII fascism and despite the film's many comical shenanigans, the inner musings on war and tragedy runs deep, even if these are masked with the film's more recognisable outer façade of a whodunit murder mystery.From costumes and makeup to the intricate crafting of its period backdrop, The Grand Budapest Hotel scores top marks as a multi-faceted and exquisitely fashioned set piece. Starting with the impressive cinematography, every frame in every scene is a picture perfect postcard. Another standout is the fantastic list of cameos, some of which are easily identifiable from Anderson's previous films. From bad guys played by Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe to an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton, this has to be one of the biggest ensembles since Anderson's very own The Royal Tenenbaums. Finally, Anderson's greatest nuance in this film is the creation of a lovable yet equally perverse Gustav. Not only has Fiennes ventured beyond his comfort zone, his Gustav commands your attention like no other character in Anderson's eccentric universe. The Grand Budapest Hotel is highly recommended as a thoroughly enjoyable dramedy that is in pole position as one of the best films of the year. Once you check in you won't want to check out!",10,2,7,30 May 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Best in the franchise but miles behind a true espionage thriller.
","At the risk of sounding biased, I must say that I have never been a true Tom Cruise fan; at least not entirely. There are two reasons for this. One ̶ I am yet to see a really inspiring movie with Cruise in the lead, other than 'Jerry Maguire'. Sure, crazed fans will hit back with the multi-Oscar winning 'Rain Man', but let's not forget, even for a moment, that Dustin Hoffman owned that movie. Two ̶ I can't recall a movie where Cruise has not played a cocky, or egotistical character. Right from a hotshot 'Maverick' fighter pilot to a self righteous vampire to a pompous Washington DC senator, Cruise has hardly ever stepped out of a 'cool zone' of his own making. Heck, for that matter, off-screen and he really pushes the envelope- ask Oprah Winfrey or David Letterman! With the Mission Impossible franchise, Cruise remains the actor we know him to be and doesn't budge. Reprising his role as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, Cruise is back for another trip around the globe complete with made-to-order disguises, hi-tech gadgetry and a team of specialists to work with. Following a botched mission in Moscow, Hunt and his team are implicated in the bombing of the Kremlin while trying to identify the whereabouts of 'Cobalt' ̶ an international nuclear arms dealer. Initiating 'Ghost Protocol' or a period of Black Ops contingency, The US President disavows IMF as an organization, leaving Hunt and a team of newly promoted field agents to clear the agency's name while simultaneously averting a cold war crisis between Russia and the United States. With the secretary killed, Hunt and his team are now rogue agents with limited resources, immunity and equipment and the last hope in preventing a nuclear strike on the United States.For an espionage thriller, this latest installment is a high octane thrill ride right from the opening scene and doesn't let go till the end. Screenwriters André Nemec and Josh Appelbaum keep the plot fairly simple (actually absurdly simple) where Cruise is supported by the voluptuous Paula Patton as Agent Jane Carter, Jeremy Renner as intelligence analyst William Brandt and funnyman Simon Pegg as the team's technical expert. With the fast pacing and extravagant styling throughout, there is little time for performance gauging of the above mentioned actors. However, Nemec and Appelbaum's story is well punctuated with ample moments that Pegg pulls off with ease. For this reviewer, adding comic moments in an otherwise high tension thriller and having Pegg execute those scenes are some of the areas where this film excels over the earlier installments and other spy thrillers. Renner and Patton add individual finesse while building unique contributions towards the plot. As I said before, Cruise is in his own element and you get to see him play another tailor-made character for the umpteenth time. There are disappointments, and my main concerns are weak characters penned for pivotal areas of the plot structure. What worked for J.J Abrams' directorial of MI3 was the dark story and an even darker villain played by the academy Award winning Philip Seymour Hoffman. Sadly, Michael Nvqvist as Hendricks, AKA Cobalt, is never daunting as the nuclear armed criminal mastermind. Playing a telecommunications tycoon cum notorious playboy, Anil Kapoor is not only miscast, his short role is a big disappointment, an unfunny joke and a huge cliché reiterating that Indian romance movies is about running around trees to seduce a woman. Like his overrated role in 'Slumdog Millionaire', casting Kapoor in this film is another example of why Hollywood can never blend with Bollywood, despite individual world appeal. All said and done, the real star of the movie is director Brad Bird for making this movie the most appealing as the latest but fourth part of the franchise. Coming from a world of animated films like the Oscar winning 'Ratatouille' and 'Up', MI4: Ghost Protocol is Bird's first live action movie as director and has done a good job in the process. Cinematography is easily the biggest visual treat with never-before-seen angles of the Burj Khalifa, some aerial views of the Kremlin and exotic locales of Mumbai and Bangalore. Close quarter fight scenes are also well choreographed considering this is Bird's first live action film and gives these scenes the look and feel of a Jason Bourne or James Bond movie. Although visual effects are top notch without going overboard, I do feel (SPOILER ALERT) the sandstorm sequence is a bit over the top as I have never seen such a huge wave of dust in the city, in all the years I have had the pleasure of living in Dubai. Produced by J.J Abrams and co-produced by Tom Cruise, Bird takes this latest installment to unprecedented levels as not only the best film in the series but also as one of 2011's above average action thrillers. As filming was done largely using the IMAX format, this film is best viewed in cinemas either on IMAX or conventional screens. Given the overall production value, the cult following behind the franchise, the 'Dubai' factor along with other brand endorsements, there is a very good chance this film will remain in cinemas longer than usual; or at least until every Dubai resident has seen this movie at least once.",7,1,2,21 December 2011
Revolutionary Road," When roses dry
","How do you dissect a seemingly perfect relationship? How thin is the line between love and hate? Danny DeVito attempted an answer to these questions in 'The War of the Roses'. So did Roman Polanski in the controversial 'Bitter Moon'. Director Sam Mendes not only answers these questions but goes on to prove that every relationship feeds expectations, but the real question is how much are you willing to compromise to keep those ever so minute cracks from growing on that all too perfect wedding portrait.Hypothetically speaking, what if a couple of young lovers where to survive a massive ship wreck over the icy Atlantic, get married, and settle down in middle class suburbia. What would their marriage seem like somewhere around the dreaded seven year itch? With absolutely no reference to the 'Titanic', Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are cast together again, this time as Frank and April Wheeler, a perfect couple in the eyes of friends and neighbors. Frank is an average nine to fiver at a city office and April is a homemaker aspiring to be an actress. While the possibility of living the American dream seem far out of reach, the Wheeler's plan on moving to Paris for what would hopefully be a much better life. April would find a good job to support the family while Frank would reflect on his true calling. Though a simple plan, negative vibes soon start to tear the very fabric of their relationship. Some of these include disapproving and jealous neighbors, severely bruised egos and even the slight case of infidelity. To make matters worse, April conceives for the third time, throwing the metaphorical spanner into the works, turning what was once love and adoration into utter loathing.DiCaprio and Winslet does it again. A power house performance by the two leads would be an understatement, given this film was nominated for three Oscars amongst other nominations and awards. Add to that an ensemble lineup of supporting roles from Kathryn Hahn, David Harbour, Michael Shannon and even Kathy Bates (also starred in the Titanic). Film noir fans will welcome this remarkable movie from Sam Mendes, especially after his dark tale of a dysfunctional family in 'American Beauty'. Couples watching this movie will find it hard to take sides. Both Frank and April are characters that could be any John and Mary. Adapted from Richard Yates' novel of the same name, costumes, sound track and cinematography are flawlessly integrated into a script that paints a vivid picture of what life leading up to the golden years was all about.",7,0,0,1 November 2012
It Follows," Nerve wrecking and unpredictable, It Follows is a highly effective Indie horror film that should become a cult classic.
","What constitutes true cinematic horror? Is it really blood, gore and jump scares, or grotesque monsters and malevolent spirits? How about an unfathomable fear of the unknown? Built on the chassis of 70s and 80s horror classics, It Follows is such a visceral horror film that it instantly redefines the very rules of the genre. And by doing so, it reaches its destination very early and refuses to budge, where needless to say, the destination is none other than a thin layer under your skin!If by now you have noticed my frequent use of the word 'It', I can tell that this film is really going to make your skin crawl. You see, writer-director David Robert Mitchell's story is based on a classic horror template of cause and effect, where the consequence is certain death. But unlike previous horror films where characters must outrun a monster or vengeful ghost just to stay alive, Mitchell's fright mechanism is intensely creepier than scare tactics used in a variety of modern horror films. Using the intimidating chain-letter as a theoretical setup, Mitchell's premise is a hex that manifests into a life threatening situation after a sexual encounter. Jay (Maika Monroe from last year's sleeper hit, The Guest), is the latest 'victim' to have received a sexually transmitted curse after a night out with Hugh (Jake Weary). Left dazed and confused, all Jay knows (or is allowed to know), is that unless she sleeps with another person (and thus pass on the curse), she will be relentlessly hunted and ultimately killed by the titular 'It'.Starting with the intentionally obscure but highly suggestive title, Mitchell's genius is in never revealing what 'It' really is. Is 'It' extraterrestrial or paranormal? We don't know for sure and neither does Jay or her teenage friends who come to her rescue. Why, how and from where are other questions that are left unanswered, inflicting more panic when we see 'It' approaching in human form. Speaking of which, only the victim and the audience can see the approach, which most of the time starts as a blurry figure on either corner of the screen. But Mitchell doesn't stop there. The entire film has a retro look and feel, and if it were not for one character's hand-held device, viewers could be mistaken into thinking this film was set in the late 1960s. Using this setting and significantly adding to the mounting tension is an electronic soundtrack that is as unforgivable as cinematographer Mike Gioulakis' panning and zooming, further wreaking havoc on the viewer's nerves. It works by manifesting an unnerving sense of claustrophobia when there's everywhere to run but nowhere to hide.As an original and highly effective indie horror film, It Follows bucks the trend in cheap clichés with stellar technical achievements, the slow build-up of mood and a terrifying atmosphere throughout. Then there's ample pause for thought on a metaphorical layer mask that you don't see at first. In context, it's like a painful or embarrassing shard of memory you've kept locked away since those turbulent adolescent years. And even if you come out with nerves intact, you still have to deal with those sexual skeletons you may have been harboring in the closet. It Follows may not be the best film of the year, but it's definitely a horror fan's dream come true. For the true horror connoisseur, perhaps even a bed-wetting nightmare!",8,56,113,13 May 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," 2011 is not over, but I think we already have a winner.
","How do you explain half the audience glued to their seats even as the end credits roll up? At the end of the film, one word I heard myself say was 'Awesome!'. As this year's summer movie mania draws to an end, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is the ground-breaking vehicle that will stay with us for a long time.The most powerful aspect of this film is its totally engaging story. Let's forget for a moment what we have seen and learnt in previous films of the same name. Scripted by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, and loosely based on Pierre Boulle's novel, the concept here is mind blowing to say the least. As a scientist at a pharmaceutical company, Will Rodman (James Franco) believes he has developed a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Having successfully tested a genetically engineered retrovirus in chimpanzees, Rodman is all set to go public when a test subject goes berserk and is consequently put down. Discovering the offspring of his ill-fated test subject, Rodman takes the baby chimp home where his father Charles (John Lithgow) names him Caesar. As it turns out, Caesar is no ordinary chimp, having inherited human-like intelligence from his mother. Then comes a powerful turning point in the story – Caesar must decide if he wants to remain a lab subject or free himself from captivity.When 'Planet of the Apes' was re-made in 2001, director Tim Burton's saving grace was the head-reeling twist in the end. What we here is far more powerful. As the new director, Rupert Wyatt brings together a full bodied story in such a manner, he has obliterated all preceding films, including the 1968 original. Having said that, this is one of those rare films where the story outdoes almost every other aspect of the production. Good thing then because I really doubt James Franco is receiving an Oscar for this film and you can be absolutely sure, neither is Freida Pinto. On that note, I really don't see what Pinto has contributed to this film except a pretty smile. Yes, there are a few few British-American accented words here and there as compared to her non-existent dialogue in 'Slumdog Millionaire', but that's about it. On the other hand, Lithgow is heart wrenching as an Alzheimer's patient and you feel for his character. Tom Felton brings aboard his nasty persona from the Harry Potter franchise and his character gets what he deserves, in what I thought is an inside joke featuring a not-so-magic wand. But as I mentioned earlier, the story is just too captivating for anyone to be even slightly bothered by screen time fillers like Pinto or Felton.Aside from the phenomenal plot, the other accolade is the ground-breaking technology used to animate apes. When 'Avatar' came out, director James Cameron was credited with the use of ground-breaking technology known as 'motion capture'. Wyatt raises the bar with acute advancements now known as 'performance capture'. Known for his performance as Gholam in 'Lord of the Rings' and Kong in 'King Kong' (2005), Andy Serkis as Caesar is an epitome of a living, breathing, swinging ape and is easily the best moments in the film. I felt as though an ape was trained to act.As if the story is not engaging enough, Wyatt's triumph is the questions worth mulling over. While our greatest strength is our intelligence, are we most vulnerable in our tendency to become complacent? This puts the human race at a disadvantage as we as a species have stopped evolving since we learned to walk upright. Whereas, every other species continue to evolve just to survive. Imagine for a minute, what if the highly agile and comparatively stronger-bodied ape were to slightly improve in intelligence. Would humans still dominate all other species? Or, will we eventually cause our own extinction and in the process allow another species to reign supreme? You know as well as I do what the answers to those questions are. And if you hesitate, don't say I didn't warn you if Caesar forces it out of you!",9,3,6,15 September 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," Infinity War is the biggest, baddest, boldest superhero film in a long time. Thank Thanos.
","With a never ending horde of superhero characters, you could call this the biggest superhero ensemble in Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Heck, even without the searing white excitement generated by all the hype, this was going to be the superhero event of the year. Anyway you look at it, Avengers: Infinity War is the biggest, baddest, boldest superhero film in a long time. And it's a long time coming with 19 preceding films in three phases over the last 10 years - it was all coming down to this. Viewers who stayed back for the post credits scene during those films (now a Marvel gold standard), were already in on it, and will be the most rewarded during this film. Although the plotline is simple, old and tired - ala save the world from an intergalactic despot - the mythology behind the story and how it is penned for the screen is by the far the best part about this film, and perhaps one of the best from the MCU. Equally praise worthy is the writing and rendition of Thanos, who is not only the best villain in the franchise but somehow the central character too. What makes Thanos even more lovable (as a villain you love to hate to love) is his human-like flaws despite his colossal repute as the most destructive and feared force in the universe. Even better is the fact that amongst the entire star cast (count at least 25 top name appearances) Thanos, voiced by Josh Brolin, is entirely CGI rendered yet still remains at the forefront of this film. In some ways, and despite the atrocities committed by Thanos, you still find a soft corner and empathetically sound reasons to believe why he does what he does. Now this is the modus operandi of a true villain and not even the avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy teamed together can stop him. Despite the expected humour throughout the film, those atrocities make Avengers: Infinity War the darkest film in the MCU. This means viewers and fans will have to brace themselves for quite a few unexpected turns in the story, some of which may seem straight out of a Greek tragedy. That is the nature of this film, and at times irresistibly devastating. However prepared you think you are, and no matter what you've heard before going to watch this film, Avengers: Infinity War is always two steps ahead. Just like Thanos. I can hardly wait to see his reincarnation as Cable.",8,1,4,27 April 2018
Gone Girl," Gone Girl is a dark and cynical thriller that throws a wicked spin into the bells and whistles of modern-day marriage.
","Deliciously dark and wickedly funny, Gone Girl is a multi-layered potboiler that is every bit entertaining and compelling as it is disturbing and shocking. As both a crime drama and psychological thriller, nothing can prepare you for the whiplashing twists and turns that propels the story towards a rewarding and explosive finale, followed by ebbing shockwaves that will leave you in afterthought even after the end credits.While there are several avenues of praise for this well-made crime caper, top credit goes to director David Fincher for what has to be his finest hour in the art of macabre storytelling. Adapted for the screen by Gillian Flynn's novel of the same name, a large part of that art stems from the systematic crafting of a story that is intended to deceive the audience into thinking exactly what the narrator wants you to think. Perception, derived from illusion, forms the backbone of this story, including how we first relate to lead characters Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his beautiful wife Amy Elliott-Dunne (Rosamund Pike). They live in Missouri after losing their jobs as writers in recession hit New York City. On the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick returns home from a bar he co-owns with twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) only to find a shattered coffee table and his wife missing. First on the scene is Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) who doesn't find Nick's answers very convincing. In fact, the more Nick is scrutinized the more he appears to be hiding something and within hours the media and Amy's friends and relatives are out for his blood. With Amy's disappearance becoming headline news, speculation rises and Nick becomes the prime suspect. Making matters worse, Nick doesn't appear to be worried about his wife's disappearance either.Readers of the book will be happy to note that Flynn has also scripted the screenplay. In the wrong hands this film could have turned out pointless and vague – an undesirable yet unforeseeable byproduct of author-director mismatch. With Gone Girl, it's hard to poke fun or fault when the screenplay is adapted by the same person who wrote the source material. If anything, the script is fine tuned for the screen and matched only by the skill of the director, who just happens to be master twister Fincher himself. It's a perfect writer-director union as Fincher is not new to manipulating the audience into believing what they are seeing. That being said, the key words here are 'union' and 'manipulation', which turns out to be the flesh and blood of the story. On the outer layer this film might seem like a whodunit murder mystery, but at the core it is a comically dark social commentary about love and hate and the thin line in between. Before bringing that pot to a boil, Fincher employs a linear narration by allowing the mystery to unravel in real time alongside flashbacks that show how perfect Nick and Amy are when they first meet, to just how incompatible they become before the latter goes missing. Then there's the manipulation. It's not just about the Dunnes or spouse versus spouse or the disintegration of marriage as a spiritual institution. By the time we get into the thick of it, Flynn's commentary manifests into a trudging dark horse tethered to the manipulation of truth and justice, before galloping towards a pound-for-pound revenge finale.Despite clocking at just under 150 minutes, this is a film not to be missed. Even with an absorbing story and the director's skill in telling that story, Gone Girl wouldn't have turned out half as good as it is without the stellar performances of all involved, including supporting roles from Tyler Perry as Nick's defense lawyer and Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's creepy ex-boyfriend. But come awards season 2015, Gone Girl could be in the spotlight for no other reason than Pike's sensational role that illustrates the idiom 'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned'. That alone should have a majority of viewers echoing the sentiment – W.T.F!",9,3,11,20 October 2014
Drive," Gosling leads the third generation of serious Hollywood talent.
","Something about Ryan Gosling caught my eye when I first saw him in 'Murder by Numbers'. Opposite Sandra Bullock, I was heavily mistaken for underestimating this relatively new actor. After 'Fracture', Gosling had my full attention. Not only did he refuse to be outdone by the legendary Anthony Hopkins, Gosling vindicated his star power as an up and coming actor with some serious screen charisma. With 'Drive', Gosling smashes it out of the park. The best part? He doesn't even say much in the movie but gets it done through sheer screen presence. Adapted from a short story of the same name, Gosling plays a nameless Hollywood stunt car driver and mechanic, who also moonlights as a getaway car driver. As the getaway driver, his rules are simple: burglars must finish the job within a five minute window and never contact him for another heist. After helping his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her young son, with car trouble, The Driver starts to spend time with them. Just when an air of attraction develops between The Driver and Irene, her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac), is released from prison. From here on, things turn ugly for everyone. Standard owes mobsters money for protection during his time in prison. The Driver helps Standard in what should be an easy 'in-out' heist, but the job is a setup and our hero ends up running the gauntlet with mobsters Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) and Nino (Ron Perlman). There are three names that I think deserve high praise for this movie. Aside from Gosling, director Nicolas Winding Refn does a phenomenal job with almost every aspect of this film. There are flaws, some factual and some due to obvious oversight in editing, but in giving Refn the benefit of the doubt, on a whole this movie is one fine piece of work. What works for Refn is the mood he creates when setting up a brooding atmosphere, along with the 1970s period setting. This is the result of seamlessly integrating an exceptional score by Cliff Martinez with intentionally mute moments. Evidently, Refn also pays attention to cinematography that focuses on a first-person perspective, literally putting the viewer in the driver's seat. Even so, you get a feel of the world surrounding The Driver, but his past always remains a mystery. It is this mysterious past, complimented with a haunting atmosphere that gives The Driver an almost super-human personality. Towards the end, this personality makes him appear unstoppable as a man on a mission. Coming back to characterization, and as I said before, Gosling owns it. He fits snug behind the skin of his character in a way that dates back to the days of a younger and angrier Clint Eastwood. I am not placing Gosling on par with the legend that is Eastwood; rather that Gosling's characterization of an anti-hero is memorable and justifies comparison to the likes of Eastwood, or even Robert De Niro for that matter. When it comes to Mulligan and Gosling in the same frame, the atmosphere shifts to a whole new level arising from just flirtatious eye contact. There is a definite yet restrained sensuality between both characters and even for the few muted scenes they are together, on-screen chemistry is obvious. Another worthy mention is Brooks as the cynical antagonist with a thing for blades. Incidentally, Brooks does it better than Perlman, where both play mafia foot soldiers. I recommend this as a must watch for its style, story, portrayals and artistic visuals. The narration flows at a steady pace but gradually picks up momentum towards the end and includes some scenes of extreme violence when you least expect it. Thankfully, Refn doesn't dwell too long on scenes of blood and gore.",8,14,23,2 February 2012
Insidious," Got me under my sheets!!
","Either way you look at it, this is a 'love it' or 'hate it' movie. As a horror movie, you will love it for giving you the chills you expect, or, you will hate it for giving you nightmares.Having loitered in the horror genre long enough, I am always skeptical when gauging a film's alleged fright factor. This has more to do with personal expectations rather than what the film promises through pre-release trailers. When this film starts, the credits have names disintegrating into ghostly smoke. To me, this animated effect is hugely similar to the light hearted 'Scooby-Do' episodes, or even Bill Cosby's 'Ghost Dad'. Within just a few minutes, I realized I underestimated the film's potential to induce hair raising chills. Perhaps this is director James Wan's way of saying 'Think you can handle a scary move? Wait till you see this!' Then Wan threw me off course again. Having scripted, directed and initiated the 'Saw' franchise, I was prepared for some blood and gore along the lines of a slasher/thriller, and no way was I expecting a true horror story. Amazingly, Wan goes on to offer a horror movie with minimal use of blood and even confines the content to a juvenile rating of PG-13. But don't let this rating misguide you.Having recently shifted to a new house, the Lamberts barely start to unpack before facing increasingly disturbing occurrences. Things take a turn for the worse when their eldest son slips into a coma after a minor fall. Doctors are baffled by Dalton's rare condition and after three months without respite, Renai and Josh bring their son home. Thinking the house to be haunted, the lamberts move again, only to realize that the problem is not the house, but that malevolent forces are using Dalton's body as a gateway into our world.Along with screen writer Leigh Whannell, Wan's success lies in the screenplay and its execution. For me, his use of the triple S formula is what really works here. At the fore is a well written script with clever homage to old school classics like 'Psycho'. Wan has also used the element of suspense, skillfully amplified by moments of deliberate silence. You just know something is going to happen, but not knowing what or when makes it all the more intense. His final S is the choice of soundtrack or score. Ominous and jolting, are the two words that come to mind. Cinematography is another area he gets right. Combined with the soundtrack, angles of filming and just the right amount of lighting, cinematography here creates the right atmosphere for the story.Aside from the technical bearing, human elements play the part to perfection. This is where most horror movies go off track, relying on effects and sound editing to do the job. As Dalton's parents, Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson dish out some plausible portrayals. With lesser screen time but with as much prominence are Barbara Hershey and Lin Shaye in custom made roles. Although each plays vital roles in the film, Shaye has the edge as an occult specialist.A common problem with Hollywood horror movies is that every now and again, a hotshot film maker thinks he/she has what it takes to outdo the previous hotshot film maker who thinks he/she did a 'hell' of a job in scaring the audience. Think about it, how many times has a haunted house, demonic possession or a Halloween themed movie been remade? No doubt, with each re-make, the makers assume superiority over the previous releases. For Insidious, the outcome is not entirely original. Some scenes of the house are also reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho'. Even with the well written script, the ending appears to have a lot more going on than the first half. Possibly Wan and Whannell attempted to through everything they had at the audience, including a dark caricature of the 'Ghostbusters'. I am not entirely convinced if this was a right move, but I can say with certainty that if this movie is meant to scare people, people will be scared. Even if this story was not made into a movie, it would still make a compelling tale by a campfire.",8,0,0,9 April 2012
Stardust," Even with limited screen time, De Niro Cracked me up.
","Just when you think you've seen it all cometh a fairy tale right out of Never Land. However, you won't find Peter Pan or Tinker Bell in this fantasy adventure, rather, an original set of characters in a truly magical world. When young Tristan Thorne promises the girl of his dreams the moon and the stars, he sets off on a fantasy quest literally reaching for the stars. Caught between malevolent witchcraft and greedy heirs to a mythological kingdom, his adventures take him on a perilous journey through air, land and sea arriving at an enlightened conclusion that true love can never be bought; no matter what the price.Penned by graphic comic novelist Neil Gaiman, this is a fantastic tale set between pre-modern England and the netherworld. On screen, it's a film filled with action, suspense, romance and comedy and goes on to breathe life back into a genre that hasn't enjoyed much significance since 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Even so, while 'The Lord of the Rings' is mainly an intense battle between good and evil, Stardust appeals to a wider audience for its atmospheric plot, flamboyant acting, exhilarating score and surreal cinematography and is a refreshing change given its originality. Acting is just stellar thanks to an ensemble cast starting with an initially unrecognizable Michelle Pfeiffer as an evil and conniving witch and Tristan's main adversary. Her first brush with magic may have been in 'The Witches of Eastwick', but given here role here, her character is both ugly and cinematically flawless. Excuse the pun, but Pfeiffer fans will be most certainly zapped! Claire Danes also gives in a commendable act as a fallen star turned fragile mortal. If her role is meant to symbolize the frailty of purity and innocence surrounded by greed born of evil, then she does so with all that we have grown to expect form her. Opposite Danes is newcomer Charlie Cox in the lead as the blindly infatuated Tristan. For one of his first major film roles, Cox delivers unexpectedly with a performance equal only to Orlando Bloom's rookie days as an up and coming actor. Perhaps the most surprising and stand performance in the entire movie comes from Robert De Niro as Captain Shakespeare, a mean swashbuckling pirate on the outside, with an embarrassing secret on the inside. In my opinion, De Niro almost single-handedly steals the show despite his limited screen time, not because he is one of my favorite actors, but solely due to his hilarious antics behind closed doors. Now if you are accustomed to De Niro's Mafioso demeanor complemented by his signature repetitive dialogs, then like me, prepare to laugh your head off. And trust me, you won't see it coming either, so avoid the built-in DVD/Blu-ray trailers. Rounding off the cast are some memorable contributions from Mark Strong, Nathaniel Parker, Sienna Miller and a cameo from Peter O'Toole. Co-written and directed by Mathew Vaughn, this is a film not to be missed especially if you liked his previous work in 'Layer Cake' and 'Snatch'. Special effects though seldom, do create a visual impact when used and is punctuated at the right moments. Even so, blink and you might miss some of the best moments. If you haven't done so already, this is the perfect film if you have been considering an upgrade from DVD to Blu-ray.",Null,2,3,3 July 2011
The Bourne Legacy," Where's Bourne?
","Having scripted the first three films of the franchise, Tony Gilroy returns for this fourth installment of the Bourne series and in the process, replaces regular director Paul Greengrass. Strike one! It's not unusual when screenwriters get to direct their own movies. Normally, this is an advantage to the director who then becomes the best person to understand how the story should be interpreted on screen. Clearly, the end result here is not outstanding, nor a sequel, but more of an off-shoot that begins sometime before the preceding events end.Except for a mere mention, it takes a good half hour before you realize that Jason Bourne is not even in this film. It takes the rest of the film to realize that this is not about Jason Bourne at all. In fact, Jason Bourne is just the tip of the iceberg, or in my case, a bait to watch this movie. Proprietors of 'The Program', the same government spooks that double-crossed Bourne are now in hot pursuit of another agent that goes by the name Aaron Cross. Headed by Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn) and Eric Byer (Edward Norton), this secret division of the CIA has only recently learned that they have bitten off more than they can chew. You see, there are certain pills that once consumed, serve as powerful genome therapies to the body and mind. Cross needs this to stay one step ahead of the CIA. His only aid is Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) who incidentally knows all about these pills. She also knows that there is a way to retain the effects of the pills without the need for periodic consumption, but must first head to the production source - the Philippines.I wouldn't recommend this film if it weren't for the stellar performance of Jeremy Renner as Cross. Make that Renner and Weisz, the only two redeeming factors in an otherwise unnecessary excuse at prolonging this franchise. Often referred to as a 'late bloomer', Renner brings on the same tenacity we loved about him in the Academy Award winning THE HURT LOCKER. As we have seen before, Renner radiates brute courage when personifying the do-or-die audacity of being pinned to the wall. That said, Renner's Cross is a polar opposite to Jason Bourne. Where the latter lost everything thanks to his superiors, Cross was an average Joe before signing up to 'The Program', to be someone, to be part of something. Once you have this power, this clarity, it becomes a territorial fight to not loose possession of the only things that add value to existence. Renner does this in the most convincing manner possible. Weisz on the other hand, has more screen time than most females in action movies. She not only supports Renner, her performance is at par, while vindicating her inclusion in an otherwise male dominated franchise. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Norton. As the antagonist, he is left with nothing more than barking out orders, which is a waste of his talent considering he could have played the methodical and manipulative villain he is known for.Coming back to Gilroy, my disappointment lies in the manner in which he chooses to tell his story – an action thriller where most of the action is displaced by extended periods of special ops mumbo-jumbo. Despite this, LEGACY has its moments, but these are few and scattered. The action scenes are intense and the franchise's signature chase sequences are back though they lack the finesse of what we've come to expect from previous directors. There is also the overuse of industry jargon that serves to recap, if anything, that Gilroy knows the difference between James Bond and a super soldier; that Robert Ludlum is the real deal in comparison to Tom Clancy; that viewers may have never read any of these books. Strike two! What's worse is the thought that after all the muddled mishmash, Gilroy expects to see this franchise grow by milking the word 'Bourne' and serving it with the word 'Legacy'. Strike three!",6,2,5,26 October 2013
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Another good Fincher and Pitt partnership.
","Although Brad Pitt takes on a supernatural role for the third time, I feel his grim reaper in 'Meet Joe Black' still stands out, even surpassing his undead character in 'Interview with a Vampire'. That said, his Benjamin Button is not only off the wall, but in a subtle way proves a timeless message – No matter who you are or whatever you become, there is always a beginning and an end.The story is narrated by a dying elderly lady, through the title character's journal. It begins one night in post World War I New Orleans when a hideous baby is born, extinguishing his mother's life as he begins his own. Aghast by this abomination, the father immediately abandons the infant hoping it would never see the light of day. But a kind hearted black woman finds and shelters the baby. Benjamin, as she names him, is a freak of nature as he is born old and frail with no apparent chance of survival. However, that doesn't stop her from raising him as her own. Then a strange thing happens, while learning to walk and talk, Benjamin starts to 'grow' younger. As the years go by, he gradually becomes younger, while everyone around him are aging and dying. Along comes Daisy, an adolescent redhead who strikes an immediate bond with a very senior Benjamin. But their new found friendship is short as she pursues a career in professional dancing while Benjamin starts work as a sailor. As the years fly past, their paths cross many times until a point when they are almost the same age, allowing them to grab a moment in time, giving into a relationship both secretly hoped for. From here on the film takes on a darker tone and like Benjamin, suggests we have already seen the happy ending in the beginning.'Forrest Gump' is one of my all time favorite movies but I couldn't help notice some uncanny similarities between these two films; starting with the Southern setting and the very Southern accents from several characters in both films. There are also mutual references to the violent hurricanes that frequent these US regions. Both Forrest and Benjamin are ridiculed and loathed from a young age, but go on to become legends of sorts. Sub-plots from both films blend with actual American history along with a short yet intense war scene. Finally, both films have an unrequited love theme that is reciprocated too late. Comparisons aside and without a doubt, the only thing more curious than Benjamin's inverted world is this intriguing story from the legendry Scott Fitzgerald. But adapting Fitzgerald's short story into a screenplay is the ingenuity of Eric Roth, the screenwriter behind 'Forrest Gump'. Even as an adaptation, the concept here is beyond original thanks to director David Fincher and his nuance as a master storyteller. It is always entertaining to have twists and turns in a good story, but an abstract story that also becomes believable as it is beautiful? From its phenomenal beginning to its profound ending, this story is about the frailty of humans and passage of time through our greatest emotions – love, yearning and loss; but not necessarily in that order.If it weren't for the overrated 'Slum Dog Millionaire', this film would have easily grabbed the 'Best Picture' Oscar at the 81st Academy awards. Picturing how Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett would look when they get old is one of the reasons why this film did win an Oscar for 'Best Makeup', amongst two other Academy Awards. Sharing intermittent screen time together, Pitt and Blanchett are perfectly cast with magnetic screen chemistry. Despite the makeup and cinema magic, this is Brad Pitt with his best foot forward and easily one of the best films of his career. Having worked with Pitt before, this epic film from Fincher will take up more than two hours of your time, but films like this are a rare achievement in contemporary cinema.",8,0,1,21 January 2012
Lincoln," By its very making, director Steven Spielberg has written the greatest obituary for one of the greatest leaders of the modern world.
","The very mention of a Steven Spielberg project and everyone goes bug-eyed in excitement and curiosity; everyone from casual movie goers to mainstream critics to cinema house managers. Now reunite Spielberg with long standing producing partner Kathleen Kennedy, throw in a multi-award winning star cast lead by Daniel Day-Lewis and a story about one of the most revered Presidents in US history and you have an Academy Award nominated movie by default. Lincoln has all these fine qualities and a whole lot more. This is not just a great film for the reasons stated above, or because it is very easy to praise a film directed by Spielberg. This is also not just a masterpiece or a very important and powerful film for the sake of calling it so. From the drawing boards to its last take, Lincoln is every bit exquisitely fashioned filmmaking — an amalgamation of art, literature, politics, society, history, and most importantly, humanism.Here's a brief re-cap to get you up to speed on the relevance of the American Civil War (1861 to 1865) as depicted in the film. The United States of America is divided as cotton rich states of the South refuse to phase out slavery. After Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln secures the Presidency, almost a dozen states in the South pull out of the 'Union' and become the Confederate States of America. As a bloody civil war rages between North and South, the film's story begins with President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. This is the Commander and Chief of the armed forces calling for slavery to be abolished in all states by seeking a landmark constitutional amendment. For this to happen, Lincoln must procure enough votes through Congress for a stay order on making slavery illegal anywhere in America. Challenged with factions within his Republican party, Lincoln becomes his own worst enemy in a daunting personal crisis: save thousands of lives by ending the war or prolong the war in favour of ending slavery.Running at 150 minutes, this film is a slow burner with extensive dialogues and frequent courthouse debates; but like the trudging power of a steam locomotive, Lincoln pushes forward with remarkable pace while never losing sight of its destination. Piloting this powerhouse of a film is Daniel Day-Lewis in easily his finest hour as a method actor. His Lincoln is tall and bent over with war-stressed fatigue and a shrill voice, but armed with a quiver full of wisdom and remedial anecdotes for when push comes to shove. Throughout the narrative Lincoln is torn within as he manages his duties as the President of a nation, as a father who has lost a son, and as a husband who must confide in his wife when decisions become complex. This is also when I must mention Sally Field in another fine delivery as First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln and the epitome of the phrase 'Behind every great man is a woman'. Field's Mary is a tragic character whose depiction of a bleeding heart is memorable in a scene where she confronts Lincoln as the father of their children, not a man with immense power. With strong characterisation forming the flesh and blood of the film, you can also expect riveting roles from Tommy Lee Jones and David Strathairn, besides a multitude of top actors.This is one of the most important films of the year and perhaps even the times we live in. By its very making, Spielberg has written the greatest obituary for one of the greatest leaders of the modern world. Lincoln is to Steven Spielberg what Gandhi is to Richard Attenborough; the commonality being crucial moments in history, rather than a history lesson per se. If I have to nit-pick, I suspect there could be historical anomalies in the narrative if this film is solely considered a biopic. This is why I strongly recommend the film as a political drama rather than a componential biography. Is it safe to say that President Abraham Lincoln was a self-made man? That he was extremely intelligent despite dropping out of school? That he changed the future of an entire nation? That Barak Obama is the current President of the United States of America because Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery? If you said 'yes' to any of these questions then Lincoln is more than just an Academy Award magnet—it is a landmark film made by people reiterating that freedom is a birth right for people everywhere.",8,38,49,30 May 2014
Evil Dead," Dead on Arrival
","If a movie tagline is anything to go by, then EVIL DEAD the remake should be 'The most terrifying film you will experience'; or so the makers would have you believe. But depending on what makes your skin crawl, this tagline is either true to the word or entirely misleading.Void of time and place, an unceremonious prologue tells us that evil exists in and around a desolate cabin in some Godforsaken part of the woods. The cabin is almost rundown but serves as the perfect spot for Mia (Jane Levy) to go cold turkey on her heroin addiction. Aiding Mia's detox is her brother (Shiloh Fernandez), and their friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas), Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) and Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci). Mia and David have a strained relationship that is never fully explained, but an unseen bond between the siblings becomes apparent as the story progresses. This of course is merely a distracting subplot because Eric, meanwhile, has discovered a book known as the Necronomicon, or 'Book of the dead'. And before they realize what the book holds within, all hell breaks loose. Quite literally. For a horror movie remade more than thirty years after the original, visual effects are impressive but rarely do these effects induce the fear or terror that is promised. To begin with, the atmosphere is never chilling or ominous even as demonic possessions start to become the mainstay in the plot. In comparing to the 1981 original, debutant feature director Fede Alvarez has made a competent horror flick that is just a few notches above the schlock-o-meter. The premise and the fight for survival remains faithfully true to Sam Raimi's original, with multiple throwbacks to THE EVIL DEAD franchise. As a homage, this remake could sit fairly well with horror fans relentless with an appetite for blood and gore. On that note, violence is of an extreme nature and Alvarez's camera-work is very unforgiving during the many slicing and dicing, and slashing and stabbing scenes. Even if you choose to close your eyes, you cannot the escape the sound of tearing flesh or many of the other forms of bodily mutilation and dismemberment. In keeping with the exploitation theme of 70s and 80s low-budget horror flicks, Alvarez stays on course and then goes all out for the blood soaked finale. This final showdown benefits from some originality, particularly when good and evil switches positions. But up until this point the suspense and fright factor is pretty much an assembly line production consistent with standard Hollywood pop culture. Ultimately, the new EVIL DEAD relies heavily on multiple references to the original without so much as exploring creative individuality. That being said, Alvarez and the screenwriters have opted for maximum gore fest instead of working towards really terrorizing the audience. Characters are unremarkable and you don't really bother who lives and who dies. Fernandez's David is particularly annoying as an idiotically gullible protagonist. Levy's Mia has one or two good scenes before becoming possessed but remaining cast members have little or nothing to work with except gallons of cinema grade corn syrup. Potentially, this film had all the wicked ingredients of a perfect remake. If only the makers (including Sam Raimi as the producer) had focused on personifying evil with some sort of tangibility, this film would have easily rubbed decaying shoulders with the likes of THE EXORCIST or THE SHINING. Eventually, what you get is evil dead on arrival. And by this I am also referring to the fact that I slept like a baby.",6,1,3,26 October 2013
The Imitation Game," The Imitation Game is a near perfect biopic on Alan Turing, an unsung World War II hero and the father of modern computers.
","Not many people knew who Alan Turing was, other than the fact that he was the father of modern computing and related artificial intelligence. As a biopic centered on Turing's crucial years, The Imitation Game is a stirring film behind his genius and why he remained an unsung World War II hero until recently.Set between 1939 and 1945, but flanked by plot arcs set in the early 1920s and 1950s, Norwegian director Morten Tyldum gives us a glimpse into three phases in Turing's life, where each phase reveals a little more about who he was, what he did, and how he helped end World War II by as early as four years. The central aspect has Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) working with British Intelligence as a code breaker in London's Bletchley Park, the UK's Government Code and Cypher School. His job is to break and decipher what the Allies referred to as the unbreakable Enigma Code – Germany's highly encrypted radio transmissions that allowed the Nazi war machine superior naval and aerial assault on vulnerable Allied positions. Assigned to a small group of code breakers including one female, Joan Clarke (Kiera Knightley), Turing is initially an outcast due to his reclusive and eccentric nature. With time running out, Turing eventually finds favour in his MI6 supervising officer Stewart Menzies (Mark Strong) whose connections with Prime Minister Winston Churchill lands him enough resources to build a machine that has half a chance at breaking the Enigma code.That World War II ended in Allied victory is retrospective of the final push between the Allied forces and Hitler's Third Reich. While cinema history is studded with countless war and action films encompassing this era, The Imitation Game, on the other hand, is not a war film and not a single bullet is fired by any of the characters. It is still a period piece and one that had to be told for at least two important reasons. In adapting from mathematician Andre Hodges' 1983 book Alan Turing: The Enigma, Debut screenwriter Graham Moore saves these reasons for the final thirty minutes of the story, thus limiting the story to a mere countdown spy-thriller, albeit well told in the hands of the director. After saving as many as 14 million lives, why wasn't Alan Turing a decorated hero? What were the real reasons leading up to his eventual suicide in 1954? And why was his memory granted posthumous honour but only in 2013? The answers are there, some of them shocking, but a little too late in the film which itself is about a story that is told a little too late.Understandably, Turing's work within the supposedly non-existent MI6 was classified until recently. The fact that this film was made after the declassification of his contribution makes sense. That being said, the final reveal feels restrained and panders towards social commentary rather than taking the time to venerate a war hero. But if you overlook flaws in the story, including a hokey 'Eureka' scene when they finally break the code, The Imitation Game is still a good film with several tense moments; one of which is the juncture the team arrives at when they break the code. It's a startling moment in the film literally illustrating the power of knowledge as godly.Thematically similar to the Academy Award winning A Beautiful Mind, with as many glowing reviews and the possibility of a parallel Oscar run, I conquer that The Imitation Game is well made and very well acted for a period piece. Cumberbatch anchors his role with absolute virtuoso in portraying Turing as an unlikable and egotistical individual with superior intelligence, while ultimately exposing his vulnerability as a misunderstood introvert. Together with Knightley, they make formidable pairing depicting interpersonal relationships that are equally charming and tragic. It is indeed a tragic story considering what Turing could have achieved for humanity, only to be utterly disregarded by what is supposedly modern civilization.",8,7,15,18 December 2014
Jurassic World," Jurassic World promises an entertainment high and it delivers with a monstrous bite.
","Some films are critic proof. Sometimes even the most verbose film critics will find themselves in gleeful abandon, for no other reason than pure cinematic indulgence. I know I did. Likewise, Jurassic World will do that to you in the most eye-popping, heart-racing way a tent pole summer movie can.Right off the bat I'll say that after the disastrous Jurassic Park III (2001), this fourth installment has no reason to exist. In fact, Jurassic World is filled with so many inconsistencies, calling it flawed would be an act of kindness. Comprising of uneventful drama about corporate excess and consumer supply and demand, pacing is a major issue during the first half of the film. Symbolic to the film's subtle theme on humanity's greed for bigger and better material possessions, this part of the film is nothing more than a talky filler leading up to the non-stop action saved for the second half. However, the pay-off is extremely gratifying and worth the wait, and it only gets better with each passing minute.Set 22 years after the events of the first film, we are taken back to the Eastern Pacific island of Isla Nublar, where the titular theme park has reopened and is once again a major tourist attraction. In the tradition of preceding films, the story revolves around a female protagonist, this time park operations manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) who believes in enticing tourists with newer attractions. Richard Attenborough's John Hammond is replaced by Bollywood thespian Irrfan Khan as Simon Masrani, the new owner of Jurassic World. Masrani is uneasy about Dearing's new attraction – a bigger and meaner hybrid creation called Indominus Rex. For the cinema audience, this aptly relates to a bigger, louder and scarier prehistoric monster. Wish granted! Even before Indominus is released as an 'attraction', expert Velociraptor trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) discovers something abnormal about this new creature. And so it begins like it always does – an accident is shrugged off as a near-miss incident. It should have been a warning. When the second accident occurs, it's already too late.Running, screaming and utter pandemonium forms the rest of the film, punctuated with the occasional yet distinctive sound of a predatory 'chomp'. This is when the film lifts off with blistering pace thanks to well executed action, suspense driven terror and technical achievements that include fluid animatronics, and fantastic visual and sound design. Production design is also massive in keeping with original author Michael Crichton's intricately detailed world in the Jurassic Park novel. In only his second foray as director, it's safe to say that Colin Trevorrow has done his homework, especially with special effects bigwig Steven Spielberg overseeing the production as executive producer. Look out for two new ferocious creatures and an old favorite brought back for an amazing finale. And just to appease fans of monster movies, Trevorrow also interjects the action with several references to the first film, along with memorable scenes from King Kong (2005) and even James Cameron's Aliens (1986). Although this doesn't say much about originality, it still works as solid aid to the entertainment factor. On the downside, and if there is a weak link in human characterization, it would have to be Howard's stereotypical damsel in distress. Only here, her character is written off as a pushy corporate executive who can outrun ravenous dinosaurs with high heels! On the other hand, Pratt anchors the film with an Indiana Jones getup and is genuinely engaging throughout. Cocky yet equally charismatic, this is an actor highly capable of becoming the next Tom Cruise.That said, Jurassic World and its older siblings have never been about an actor's depth. It's all about the dinosaurs and their fight for supremacy in the food chain. After all, these were creatures of calamity but also creatures that dominated the planet long before we did. Bringing them back to full celluloid life is where this film excels and by the looks of it, no expense was spared. In other words, if there's one film that gives you your money's worth this summer, this is it and does so in Jurassic proportions.",7,7,17,17 June 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," Do we leave things to fate, or are we part of some big plan?
","Are we in control of our lives, do we leave things to fate, do our choices determine the course of our lives, or are we a miniscule part of some unfathomable plan? Though found in bits and pieces, this movie is an astounding answer to at least one of these questions.New York Congressman David Norris (Matt Damon) is a serious contender as the youngest politician in a campaign vying for a seat in the US Senate. As a charismatic crowd pleaser, he is loved by the media and the masses alike. His greatest strength is the high level of transparency he is known for. Needles to say, transparency and politics have never gone hand-in-hand but this is why he is loved as a politician. On the flip side, David's tendency to react on an impulse also gets him to the front pages, but with diminished fervour. After one such incident and a chance encounter, David meets Elise (Emily Blunt), instantly igniting a spark that draws them together. Unknown to them, there are forces at work, arduously preventing a further union. When David questions their authority, he is faced with alarming consequences that could jeopardise his relationship with Elise. As a result, David is left with a choice where he must never see Elise again or risk destroying his and her aspirations in life; this includes his rise to power and her becoming a famous ballet dancer.Written for the screen and directed by George Nolfi, this directional debut is affluent in creativity and intelligent story telling. Prior to trying his hand at directing, Nolfi wrote the scripts for 'Ocean's Twelve' and 'The Bourne Ultimatum' (both starring Matt Damon). It is no surprise then, why this works for Nolfi. The concept alone is thought proving enough to engage the viewer from start to finish. If you have ever wondered why things don't go according to plan or why life sometimes throws a nasty curve ball, it is because a shadow organisation is ensuring we (as humans) do not deviate from a pre-existent, albeit, almighty plan. Conceptually, this is the film's profound message and is plausible in the way the plot unfolds. As the title indicates, agents from the Adjustment Bureau personify Heaven's angels or 'Case Officers' as one agent calls himself. All case officers enforce instructions or 'adjustments' as written by 'The Chairman'. Playing some of these agents are Anthony Mackie, John Slattery and Terence Stamp, in order of hierarchy. While Mackie's character tries to help David, Stamp's Thompson is an ominous force to deal with.Although this is a plot driven film, what really makes this a 2011 standout is having Matt Damon and Emily Blunt as love truck leads. More than just a love story, the concept here relies on bitter-sweet romance compounded by mystery and uncertainty. What makes this a must watch is the cheer chemistry between Damon and Blunt. While David tries to stand in the way of an omnipresent force, his screen time with Elise is few and short. This adds to the overwhelming feeling of wanting them to be together. If you are hopeless romantic, a box of Kleenex should help suppress those tears.Coming back to Nolfi, and since this is his first film as a director, I am left with nothing but praises for his attempt at putting together an off-beat romantic thriller. While I can place the film somewhere between 'City of Angels' and 'The Butterfly Effect', The Adjustment Bureau holds its ground in creative thinking. Yes, there are a couple of plot holes towards the end, while the build up of suspense and mystery is rewarded by a low-key climax. But considering everything else this film has to offer, Nolfi can be given the benefit of doubt with as much as an applaud for his efforts in producing what will be considered unforgettable and unconventional.Come Oscar season 2012, I won't be surprised if this film is nominated for an Academy Award.",7,0,1,26 June 2011
Silence," Outside its technical and artistic sense, Silence is both an examination and antithesis on faith and spirituality.
","28 years - That's how long director Martin Scorsese took to conceive this film. Based on a 1966 novel of the same name by Shūsaku Endō, a Japanese author inspired by Christian dogma, 'Silence' marks the 75- year-old director's 25th feature film in a career spanning half a century. It's a passion project and every great filmmaker has at least one of these films that take a considerable amount of time to produce. For this reason and more, 'Silence' has the potential to be Scorsese's magnum opus but only time will tell if this film reaches that level of reverence. It is a powerful film and an important one too as an epic reiteration of the persecution of Christians in 17th century Japan; Important, because discrimination against one's beliefs exists today as it has throughout history. The existence of God, and whether religion is flawed has not only been the subject of debate for centuries but also the cause of several genocides that have resulted in the massacre of millions. Using this argument and based on an actual event as chronicled by Endō, 'Silence' is an examination into questions relating to faith, spirituality, and atonement.In broadening the scope of these questions, we follow the journey of Catholic priests Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garrpe (Adam Driver) from Portugal to Japan to find their mentor Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who is reported to have been tortured into renouncing his faith. This is a time when most of Japan is still under feudal law where villages are governed by unflinching Samurai lords (chillingly represented by Japanese actor Issei Ogata). They take on the role of 'inquisitors' who capture and torture Christians in the belief that no religion can take root in Japan simply because religion and its doctrines are manmade, whereas true spirituality can only come from nature. In witnessing unspeakable torture exerted on other Christians, Rodrigues prepares for martyrdom but his captors have a cruel plan in place – commit apostasy by openly rejecting his faith, or watch an entire village put to death by refusing to do so. Worse still, all his fervent prayers for deliverance are met with silence.With a run time of 160 minutes, it's a sluggish film to get through and it isn't for everyone either. It's also an unusual narrative given the director's affection for epic crime films. But Scorsese is onto something profound because at the heart of the film are bold and provocative questions on theology and our finite understanding on something as infinite as creation itself. This is reserved for the third act when Neeson's character surfaces with some very logical statements on divinity that even staunch Catholics will find taxing to digest. This is the strongest part of the film and yet, Scorsese's broad strokes aren't about good versus evil, and violence though hellish, is not about hatred inflicted by one religion on another. Although the film's climactic moment is whether Rodrigues apostatises his faith, the conclusion demands psychological insight into the boundless characteristics of love, where sacrifice is at the pinnacle of a triangular relationship between love and loss. In a way this is a paradox embedded in a complex narrative but one that might require multiple viewings to fully understand the inner conflicts associated with the solitary nature of silence.The use of that silence is a little too literal in the film too, with barely any soundtrack or background music. Without which, scenes that convey emotional gravitas loses some of that intensity. There are also issues with accents that feel out of place, yet none of these quibbles stack up to Scorsese's grand fresco of an age old battle between man and his own worst enemy – his soul. After all, Scorsese himself once studied to be a priest but somewhere along those 50 years as a filmmaker, lost his soul to cinema. And judging from the austerity of this film, that's a good thing.",8,1,3,30 January 2017
Hotel Mumbai," At times hard to watch, Hotel Mumbai reminds us of the dark times we live in, but also humanity's innate ability to prevail.
","'26/11' is a date many people will never forget; perhaps as many as a billion people. It's the day terror struck the heart of India through separate but coordinated attacks across various parts of the Mumbai metropolis. Even now, a decade later, the very mention of that tragic event can open wounds that have barely healed. Debut feature director Antony Maras knows and respects this, which is why Hotel Mumbai is not only a gripping thriller based on those events, but also one with an unusual perspective.Maras also knows that as a docudrama, re-enactment of that terrible day can hardly pass for popcorn entertainment. Having co-written the script based on interviews with eye witnesses and news reporters, Maras also avoids offering any political commentary other than what is already known. As such, we know very little about the ten young men who infiltrate the Mumbai slums on nothing but a rubber dinghy. The film doesn't even say where they have come from except for implied clues in their Punjabi accents and extremist ideologies. What is certainly clear are their instructions to inflict maximum carnage for the whole world to see. And so it begins - civilians from the Chhatrapati Shivaji railway terminal to the popular Leopold Café, and ultimately the Taj Palace Hotel are gunned down mercilessly by perpetrators armed to the teeth. In nail-biting detail, the film goes to great lengths to depict the fate of those victims - panic, terror, and massacre - in that order. Editing teams have also done a bang on job in seamlessly blending the film's dramatized events with real news footage. There is also restraint applied in not going over the top with what could have been gruesome but exploitative violence.And yet, Hotel Mumbai is far from perfect. In reality, over 170 people lost their lives in twelve separate attacks over a period of three days. In the film, the bulk of the narrative centers on four assailants who terrorize guests and employees of The Taj Palace. The perspective shifts from them receiving cellular instructions from a voice referred to as 'The Bull,' to the opulence of the famed hotel, followed by its systematic destruction from within. Opposite these four terrorists are a few key people handpicked to either survive or perish - Dev Patel as an eager young waiter and father, Anupam Kher as daring head chef Hemant Oberoi, Armie Hammer and Nazanin Boniadi as newlywed hotel guests and Jason Isaacs as a Russian businessman, among few others. With the only interjections being brief TV footage of other areas under attack (including a shot segment showing terrorist Ajmal Kasab detained in hospital following his capture), you start to wonder why the narrative doesn't shift from the hotel to the remaining ten or eleven other places hit. This is followed by absurd and misplaced humour depicting these terrorists as fresh off the boat (no pun intended) and naïve to modern amenities of civilisation - a stark contrast to their otherwise unsympathetic and deadly composure.Hotel Mumbai doesn't raise the bar if perceived as an action thriller (especially for a global audience). To be fair, I doubt this film was intended as such. But if the film is intended to showcase an outburst of humanity, resilience to persecution, unimaginable selflessness, and the miraculous will to survive, then Maras, along with the cast and crew, have crafted a heart wrenching film that will become a crowd-pleaser, albeit unintentionally. And adding to its merit, there isn't a single character that can be defined as either a hero or a villain. Patel himself is back to his career roots, but is masked out (along with Hammer) in all the ensuing chaos, that there isn't an actual lead character. But as the title suggests, Mumbai's sons and daughters were slaughtered along with foreign visitors. The fact that the siege culminated at the Taj Palace Hotel is of no consequence given the diabolical nature of pure hatred. The film gets this right without being too on the nose. And then some. In the wake of recent and similar atrocities in Christchurch, New Zealand, the horror and the realism in the act of snuffing out innocent lives can be hard to watch. It's a reminder of the dark times we live in, but also that we prevail because we are human.",7,23,117,20 March 2019
Everest," Everest is a spectacular audiovisual experience despite a somewhat underwhelming narration.
","Filmed for the biggest screens out there, Everest is the result of an expertly crafted production design that boasts unparalleled vistas of the world's tallest mountain. Even during its most harrowing moments there is an unrefined sense of grandeur that will appeal to most viewers. That alone should be worth the price of admittance, but also worth mentioning is that expectations should be kept in check.Majestic in scale, both literally and visually, Everest runs at 120 minutes while actively seeking to answer a very important question – why do people do it? More shocking than some of the most brutal moments in the film is the intricacy of the answer that most viewers won't get until after the film. Based on the ill-fated 1996 expedition to the titular summit, William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy's screenplay is set in a world where reaching the summit has more commercial value than anything else. Even more shocking is the fact that some of these climbers are everyday-people who pay top dollar for bragging rights to the summit. One of them is a mailman (John Hawkes) and another is an influential doctor from Texas (Josh Brolin). Oddly, the going rate is $65,000 for three months preparation that comes with Sherpa guides and a seasoned team leader. All this might sound like a dodgy deal for anyone confined to the bunny slope of a ski resort. Unsurprisingly, and as based on the events of 10 May 1996, the expedition was destined for disaster and this is where the film does what it does best.For what could have been the motion picture event of the year, Everest is narratively a mess, and for the sake of a pun I'd even say it's a disaster in some ways. While it's always great to have an ensemble cast playing out the story, the main problem arises from bit sized characters in what should have been important roles for these characters. There are so many of these characters spread across the narration, that at any given time, you can't tell who the central character is even if some of these characters are primed with a background sob-story. Real life mountaineer - Rob Hall - is given some importance as the expedition leader and Australian actor Jason Clarke anchors this role with finesse. On the other hand, the second team led by Jake Gyllenhaal's Scott Fischer loses significance although there's a good 45 minutes used up for character introduction and background story. Amongst others, Sam Worthington, Robin Wright and Keira Knightley join Gyllenhaal in bit roles that barely nurture, if not tilt-shift the narrative towards characters destined to survive or perish.Despite some unnecessary background melodrama and the aforementioned zigzagging of the story, Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur brings out an overwhelming amount of dread as the minutes pile up along with the body count. It's one of the few moments in the film where you get a little premonition on what is about to happen. This is largely due to the way Emily Watson executes her role as the Base Camp coordinator and a person with remarkable insight. If there's one person who outperforms the rest of this star studded lineup, it's definitely Watson and does so with just her eyes. Just as captivating are the technical aspects of this film with heart-stopping panoramas from the foothills of Nepal right up to the pinnacle of Mt. Everest. Just don't go in expecting a white-knuckle action-thriller and you won't feel robbed. At its best, Everest is an audiovisual 'experience' that places the viewer right in the middle of one of the harshest terrains on the planet. On an IMAX screen, that's a fair deal for the 99 percent of us who haven't climbed anything more than a ladder.",7,0,1,17 September 2015
Elysium," In the shadow of Blomkamp's District 9
","ELYSIUM is a bitter-sweet social commentary that uses brutal allegories to reiterate the alarming rate at which socio-economic and geo-political ties are disintegrating all over the planet. As a follow up to the thought provoking and thoroughly entertaining DISTRICT 9 (2009), South African writer-director Neill Blomkamp's latest offering is yet another visionary parable to mull over. And while the first half is a frightening impression of the future of humanity, the second half feels rushed and diluted. Even so, the film has a lot to offer in terms of visual effects and explosive action.Although Blomkamp's narrative begins in a dystopian future set in 2154, the story has a modern day setting that uses current events in cleverly hidden metaphors. Consider the following facts: The French Revolution that led to the execution of the monarchy; Derogatory sentiments deriding Android phones as 'ghetto' products; Fatalities of illegal immigrants on route to greener pastures; The prospect of space tourism that only the super-rich can afford. Now imagine in the not too distant future, the extremely wealthy live on a pristine space station where state-of-the-art health care prevents people from premature death. The remaining ninety-nine percent of the population are left to suffer on the diseased, polluted and over populated planet we call Earth. Thus begins Blomkamp's setup where the premise is a thematic and often desperate struggle for equality. Amongst Earth's 'ghetto' population, blue-collar worker Max Da Costa (Matt Damon) has always dreamt of shortening the ever widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. Now diseased and dying, the only means of rejuvenating his health lies aboard the titular space station. But preventing Max from leaving Earth is Elysium's iron-fisted Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and her rogue agent - the terrifying and almost psychotic Kruger (Sharlto Copley). Where Blomkamp excels is in presenting a bleak scenario that is not only plausible but also discomforting. Considering the real world disparity between man-made utopias and an unfed infant in so called 'third world countries', it becomes all the more unsettling that this story is not entirely make believe. This is precisely what gives ELYSIUM a powerful yet thought provoking backdrop. All else, from gritty action sequences to the CGI built paradise in space benefits from the current going rate in Hollywood. On the other hand, character development leaves much to be desired. Two-time Academy Award winning Foster is either miscast or given very little to work with, but definitely my biggest disappointment in this film. There is simply no punch in what appears to be her first antagonistic role. Foster shares this downside with William Fichtner, another underrated actor whose talents are wasted in what should have been a key role. Thankfully, Damon and Copley make up for any noticeable lapse in the acting department. Together, their characters portray the fickle polarity of the human nature while also providing the film's testosterone fuelled action, including scenes of intense shootouts and sudden blood splatter. In a year that coughed up quite a few sci-fi films, with some even treading into apocalyptic territory, ELYSIUM stands on firm ground as a film that tackles social issues head-on. And while this film is far from perfect, there are ample reasons why this film is still worth a trip to the cinema.",7,13,21,14 November 2013
The Artist," A modern masterpiece about a bygone era.
","Call me a new age critic, but I must have seen only a dozen black and white movies, half of which was re-mastered during the Technicolor era. Having said that, this movie has shot up to the top of my list – Perfect and flawless, yet deep and heart wrenching. What a fantastic and moving experience! This is not just a throwback to the early days of cinema; this movie embodies the heart and soul of cinema as we know it. For a B&W movie, ironically, it is very vivid in its message that no matter who or what we have become, we should never forget our roots.Written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius, this is the motion picture event of 2011 and for a variety of reasons. Hazanavicius' story is simple yet profound with several underlying messages. Set during the late '20s era of black and white films, it tells of the diminishing favor of silent movies as the film industry gives into the increasingly popular 'talkies'. As George Valentin, Jean Dujardin plays a famous but ageing silent movie star when he literally bumps into Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). Although they form an instant bond, Peppy is overly charismatic and grabs the attention of studio executives with ease. Simultaneously, and with the advent of sound in films, Peppy is all the rage, while George maintains that talkies are just a fad. The inevitable happens when producer Al Zimmer (John Goodman) heralds in the new era of cinema, where Peppy becomes a major Hollywood star, sending George into a tragic downward spiral.If a picture can speak a thousand words, ladies and gents, this movie is that picture. For a silent black and white film, there is so much conveyed, all through astounding facial expressions made possible by brilliant performances. French actors Dujardin and Bejo are simply flawless without uttering a single word. More than just reincarnating screen legends like Charlie Chaplin, Gene Kelly, Grace Kelly or Gloria Swanson, together, Dujardin and Bejo has resurrected a period in history that faded in oblivion almost a century ago. Also worth mentioning are great supporting roles from James Cromwell as George's loyal chauffeur, Goodman as the studio boss and Penelope Ann Miller as George's uncompromising wife, with special mention to Uggie the dog – playing a vital and heart wrenching role.At the end of the movie, standing up and clapping is the least anyone can do in appreciating Hazazavicius' brilliantly crafted work. Without having to mention the staggering number of times this film has been acknowledged at various film festivals and award institutions, I can say that the performances, the story and the music are THE defining factors of this movie. Speaking of which, the original score by Ludovic Bource clearly sets the tone and hugely amplifies the already overwhelming emotions, throughout.With the Academy Awards just round the corner, I personally feel that 'The Artist', 'Hugo', and 'The Help' are each worthy of being nominated for the 'best Picture'. A common thread between the first two is the obvious homage to the early days of cinema and an uncanny 'French connection' that binds them together. Even so, Hazazavicius may have turned the tables on Scorsese with this simple yet beautiful movie within a movie. Pun unintended. In narrowing that down to just one choice, my heart goes out to 'The Artist'. Sure, the likes of Brad Pitt, George Clooney and even Spielberg and Scorsese are often considered Hollywood's favorite sons, but having said that, Michel Hazanavicius and Jean Dujardin have more than reiterated the quintessential soul of cinema – its integrity, its origins, its essence and why it remains society's most powerful form of art.Watch it only because this is a masterpiece.",10,8,15,21 February 2012
La La Land," An overwhelming ode to the City of Stars
","Thoroughly engaging and moving at the same time! I remember being floored by The Artist (2011's Academy Award winning Best Picture) and it's still one of my favorites. On a similar level, La La Land celebrates the transporting power of the movies with music and magic that never feels routine, rather, a heartfelt ode to cinema itself.It isn't just a musical either. Like The Artist before, this is a very simple film (none of that mind bending stuff) but also brutally honest on the harsh and often destructive nature of show biz; while the media is always ravenous for Hollywood scandals, what we don't often see are the painful choices and sacrifices these artists have had to make. And for that reason La La Land isn't just a device to revive musicals but also a heart wrenching account of what it takes to be successful in show biz. Kudos to Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, not just for their Velcro-like chemistry but also for perfecting that colossal irony often expected at the movies – a happy ending. That ending segment when we see what could have happened was almost unbearable but it's also the director revealing the quintessential soul of this film – and for me, it is in a perpetual state of enchanting melancholy.",10,4,9,9 January 2017
Super 8," They don't make 'em like this anymore...
","Simultaneously premiering in the UAE on 16 Jun, I had a choice to make'Green Lantern' or 'Super 8'. If you are reading this, then my choice was quite obvious. Although the marketing hype for 'Green Lantern' was good, I settled for this movie simply due to the J. J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg collaboration. While both have been known to possess a flair for Sci-fi adventures, my curiosity was out of bounds when anticipating what this partnership could produce.Set during the summer break of 1979, teenagers Joe, Charles, Cary, Preston, Martin and Alice go about producing a low budget zombie movie using Charles' hand held Super 8 motion camera. Just before wrapping up, they witness a horrific train crash, caused by derailment by head-on collision with a pick-up truck. Having barely survived the crash, the children's biology teacher, instructs them never to recount what they just saw; for their own safety and the safety of their parents. Soon enough, the crash site is cordoned off by the US Air Force, plunging the small town into mystery and peril with unexplained disappearances of household metals and even some town folk.Written, produced and directed by J. J. Abrams with Spielberg signing on as co-producer, this film is more than just a tribute to sci-fi mysteries of the 1980s. True, there will always be negative criticism, as the film's plot will be compared to 'E.T The Extraterrestrial', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'Cloverfield'. But with 'Super 8' produced by Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, there is absolutely no question of plagiarism on Abrams part. How can there be one, when the studio executive is none other than Spielberg himself? Unwarranted negative criticism aside, this film is well made, from casting and acting to special effects and production values. Although Abrams has interjected humour at the right moments, his general feel of the plot centres on the tragedy of loosing a loved one. For good measure, he also throws in moral messages associated with the sense of belonging and acceptance. Again, this juncture will be compared to Spielberg's ET trying to fit in amongst humans. As the narrative revolves around the lives of teenage children, casting is near perfect with captivating portrayals from Joe Lamb and Elle Fanning as Joe and Alice. This could well be Elle's claim to fame, rather than living of her sister's (Dakota) repute as a child star. Some unexpected yet amusing moments are well rendered by Riley Griffiths, Ryan Lee and Zach Mills. With limited screen time, but worthy of screen presence, Kyle Chandler as Joe's grieving father and the town sheriff, and Ron Eldard as Alice's alcoholic father standout among the adult cast.As a child of the 1980s, I can relate to this film with boyish nostalgia. Thankfully, I didn't have to deal with aliens or monsters in the flesh. However, Abrams does an excellent job in capturing the mindset of a teenager. From that perspective, there is adventure, fantasy, puppy love, heart break and even terror. Filming is clearly digital and takes you back to an era when low lit scenes were peppered with heavy grain, also called 'noise' by photographers. Back then, cinematographers had to use special films for low lit scenes. The unavoidable disadvantage was the noise level. Here, this works to Abrams' advantage and is obviously intentional in creating the look and feel of a bygone era in film making. Another aspect Abrams gets right was resisting the temptation to bring this out in 3D. While there are moments during the film that could have the audience bobbing and weaving, the intended atmosphere would have been lost to a plastic gimmick. Where Abrams excels as the film's director, is in placing special effects in the background. He gives a lot of focus to character development while heightening the mystery of 'something dangerous lurking in the background'. As such, we never get a full glimpse of what terrorizes the small town of Lillian (Ohio). When we do get to see it, the film is in the final act. This here is my only gripe, especially when there is evidently so much work put into drawing in the audience. Maybe it is just me, but if the film spans 112 minutes, where is the harm in adding another 15 minutes to avoid the risk of an abrupt ending? Although 'King Kong' (2005) has a tragic ending, the final act is simply spectacular. Having said that, if you are the type of person to go for first impressions, rather than last impressions, then 'Super 8' is an otherwise great piece of filmmaking.With a PG-13 rating (PG-15 in the UAE), this is a film for the entire family. So load up the SUV and get to the nearest cinema. Leave the dog at home.",7,9,18,19 June 2011
Sinister," Terrifying from the get go!
","From my personal experience, there are essentially two types of true horror movies – best described as 'sinkers' and 'jumpers'. SINISTER manages a rare feat in that it will cruelly weigh you down into your seat with its undeniably chilling atmosphere. And just when you think you can't sink any further, the film will throw you some well-timed moments of sheer fright that will launch you off your seat.Any fan of the genre will find the beginning clichéd with all the trappings of some classic horror films of yesteryears. Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) is a non-fiction crime writer whose previous book has brought him fame and fortune by detailing some gruesome homicides in a manner that questions the competence of law enforcement personnel. As expected, Ellison does not receive a warm welcome when he moves into a new house with his wife and two children. The local Sheriff (Fred Thompson) warns the Oswalts that the house has seen better years, but only Ellison knows that their new home was the scene of a multiple homicide, where the previous family was hanged to death. Looking for inspiration on his new book, Ellison finds it in a box of super-8 film footage; five in all. Each film depicts the hideous deaths of different families in various locations, including the family that was killed in the house before the Oswalts moved in. As Ellison becomes obsessed with the footage, his family slips into utter chaos with terrifying consequences; but this is where the clichés end. Through close scrutiny, Ellison discovers a link threading all five murders – an unsettling demonic presence that seems to be reaching out from within the films.Right from the title, the director works towards delivering his promise. This is a scary film in part or whole, depending on how experienced you are as a horror fan. Believe me, there is something for everyone; even the hardest of skeptics. Aiding the plot is strong character build-up by Hawke, and as the film progresses, Juliet Rylance as Ellison's wife Tracy. Hawke is convincing as a crime-writer with an appetite for fame. There is an amusing confrontation when Tracy discovers Ellison's true motive behind moving into the new house. This is Rylance's moment, delivering with the fierceness of a protective mother who has only just realised the dangerous consequences of her husband's stupidity, even though they are sitting on a goldmine of a story.It is no secret that the horror genre is dying. This is because film makers, and screen writers for that matter, are always searching for the next best way to scare an unsuspecting audience – 'Unsuspecting' being the key word. Inspired by paralysing horror films like THE RING and INSIDIOUS, director Scott Derrickson uses C. Robert Cargill's screenplay to maximum knee-jerking effect. Yes, there are moments that allow the viewer to cower in preparation for a frightening jolt, but Derrickson's nuance is in those unnerving moments that seem to reach out to the viewer directly, while oblivious to the on-screen character. Watch out for these scenes where things happen off-centre but extremely intentional in spooking you. Blink and you might miss it, but Derrickson has thrown in quite a few of these scenes just in case you blink a lot!Despite its faults towards the end, there is a lot to like about SINISTER. Even if you end up watching this movie by peeping through your fingers, there is mystery, murder and mayhem and it all leads to a morbid twist you won't see coming. Oh, and one more thing, the soundtrack is dreadful, in a ghastly way. It's as if Derrickson recorded the wailing of tormented souls and played it back just for kicks. You have been warned.",7,1,2,10 January 2013
Limitless," Conceptually original, but somehow incomplete.
","Scientifically, we are known to use between 10-20 % of our brains. However, the who's who in neurochemistry believes this to be a myth. As humans, we supposedly use 100% of brain, but at different times. Then again, that last line would be in obvious reference to the most intelligent of humans. But imagine what it would be like if we could use 100% our brain all the time.Edward Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a down and out writer having failed to meet a deadline in handing in his new book. Worse, Eddie can't find the words to get his book started. On the verge of becoming a 'nobody', Eddie bumps into Vernon Grant, a drug dealer and brother of his ex-wife. Out of goodwill, Vernon offers Eddie an experiential drug called NZT48, claiming it has the ability for humans to harness 100% of the brain's capacity. With nothing to loose, Eddie consumes the pill and within a minute, receives an extra boost to his sensory perceptions. With NZT taking immediate effect, everything becomes absolutely clear to Eddie. From enhanced intelligence to boosted confidence, Eddie is a new man with an alter ego; A highly intelligent superhero of sorts, whose forte lies in 'brain over brawn'. Not only does he publish his book, Eddie ventures into the financial world of stocks and shares and becomes rich at an unbelievable pace. Soon enough, Eddie's blazing pace catches the eye of financial mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert DeNiro). Although Loon is skeptical about Eddie's origins, he employs the latter rather than have to face competition from a rising Wall Street comet.But as it seems, everything has a price. Eddie soon finds himself in a world of trouble. Not only is NZT addictive, withdrawal from the drug is potentially lethal. Eddie also learns that he is not the only person to benefit from this drug. Furthermore, having found Vernon murdered, Eddie walks away with a stash of NZT, only to become a target for multiple assassins.When Bradley Cooper is not hung over from a bachelor party, he is a straight up action junkie or a drama king. This film is ample proof that Cooper is a multifaceted actor. This is also a Bradley Cooper film from beginning to end and will serve as a visual treat for all his female fans. Then there is DeNiro doing what he does best. Having recently cut a niche for himself in comedy, DeNiro is back as the steely eyed nemesis with ulterior motives. As far as acting goes, I have nothing more to report. OK, maybe a quick mention to Abbie Cornish as Eddie's on-off-on girlfriend and Johnny Whitworth as Vernon. All else are forgettable.Based on Alan Glynn's novel 'The Dark Fields', the concept here is ground breaking. Adapting from this book, Leslie Dixon's screenplay is intriguing for the most part. The script is visually enhanced by mind bending cinematography, some of which include fish-eye images and extensive zooming; Kudos to director Neil Burger for this technical finesse. As a sci-fi thriller with traces of a cloak and dagger feel, Limitless is mostly entertaining and oozes with style, thanks to Cooper's on-screen charisma. Yes, but I also said the screenplay is intriguing for the most part. There is a lot of effort put in to give this movie the look and feel it has and this is evident from start to finish. Somehow, all that effort seems rushed towards the end. The screenplay takes a beating as well. As such, the last 20 minutes seems clichéd and contrived. For lack of better words, I would call it a signature Hollywood ending.If you don't mind the tapered final act, some unanswerable questions and the notion that drugs can make us virtually invincible, then this is quite an entertaining movie with an equally interesting concept.",7,1,1,27 June 2011
Don't Breathe," Shocking, intense and terrifying
","Remember that hilarious film about a kid outwitting burglars in Home Alone? Now get a load of Don't Breathe, a clever twist on the home invasion genre that will have you quivering in fear instead of laughing out loud. There's a significant twist too but before this is revealed, director and co-writer Fede Alvarez wastes no time in unleashing a truckload of terror. A quick introduction tells us that petty thieves Rocky, her boyfriend Money and Alex are down on their luck until they receive a tipoff about an old man who received a cash settlement after his daughter was killed in a car accident. To their pleasant surprise, the old man is blind and he lives alone in an abandoned neighborhood. But once they break into his house, there awaits more surprises that are not so pleasant, and as it turns out, shockingly nasty for us too. Deeply rooted in the horror-thriller genre, Don't Breathe spans at just under 90 minutes, but don't underestimate its relatively short running time or its skimpy production budget. In just his second offering since the Evil Dead reboot, Alvarez delivers with almost Hitchcockian precision by using suspense and shock like a one-two punch combo. And although these are his principal tools to induce primal fear in the audience, there's plenty more at work to have viewers peeping through their fingers. Technical aspects like deft camera-work and sound mixing amplifies the fear factor to discomforting claustrophobia, owing to which the mounting peril on screen becomes directly proportional to increasing stress levels experienced by the viewer.While the actors playing the burglars are virtually unknown, Jane Levy as Rocky and Daniel Zovatto as Money aren't new to horror, having previously starred in Evil Dead and It Follows (2015) respectively. As the script dictates, they don't have to say much yet successfully depict the outright horror of facing a superior and deadly antagonist known simply as 'The Blind Man' (Stephen Lang). If you thought Lang was a menacing villain in Avatar, nothing but nerves of steel can prepare you for his terrifying delivery in this film; and that's before his character turns off the lights. Don't Breathe isn't the kind of gimmicky horror film made for cheap thrills. And if one cares to notice, there's even subtle social commentary on the failing economy in parallel to an unstable justice system. But that's just the film at its lightest. At its best, this is a horror film that is wickedly dark and for some viewers even nerve-wrecking to the point of suffocation. But then the title is already an apt warning – watch with bated breath.",8,6,11,30 August 2016
In Time," Average at best...
","The idea of a perfect socio-political society has been a driving theme in countless sci-fi movies, many of which take place in a futuristic utopia. While sci-fi classics like 'Total Recall' and 'Blade Runner' not only raised the bar for its time, these movies have also stood the test of time as benchmarks; even for this day and age. As such, there will always be movies that try to top the sci-fi genre by any means possible. 'Gatacca' was one such film that looked at genetic discrimination and individuality, when comparing the weakness of humans with the strengths of clones. Writer-director Andrew Niccol had a lot of things going for him with the Academy Award nominated 'Gatacca'. This time around, Niccol returns as writer, director and producer, but fails on almost every aspect of this film.It is the year 2161 and humans are genetically engineered to live up to the age of 25. As this is just the early part of the plot, it is safe to assume that this must be a drastic but necessary step to curb (the current) population crisis. To sit through the remaining part of the movie, you have to suspend reality and everything thing else you may know about what makes the world tick. Taking the age old idiom that 'time is money', time is literally currency in this movie. The more time a person has, in units of hours, years, or decades, entitles that person to live that much longer beyond the age of 25. Surprised? Wait, there's more. An implant on the hand of a person displays just how much time they have left and time can also be transferred from one person to another. Salaries or loans increase (extends) time, while purchases decrease time .When a person 'times-out', that person dies instantly. With less than two hours remaining, Rachel Salas (Olivia Wilde) discovers to her horror, that she cannot board a bus home due to an unexpected price hike from one hour to two hours. Not finding his mother on the bus, Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) runs down the street to find her. She times-out just before falling into his arms. From here on, the plot goes from ridiculous to ludicrous. Will learns that time is imbalanced, where rich people live longer and poor people die every day (who would have guessed!). To avenge his mother's death, Will does the most sensible thing- he kidnaps the daughter of Philippe Weis (Vincent Kartheiser) a wealthy banker, and demands a million years as ransom. As it turns out, Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) is not too fond of her father either, and becomes Will's accomplice in a series of bank robberies aimed at distributing time to people in the ghettos. In hot pursuit are mobsters known as the 'Minutemen' and a police force run by the 'Timekeeper' (Cillian Murphy).What I find unbelievable is the fact that Nicool also wrote the scripts for 'The Truman Show' and 'The Terminal', both critically acclaimed movies that placed lead characters in the middle of an identity crisis. Having said this, it is a big mystery as to what was going through Nicool's mind while scripting the screenplay here. I get real world comparisons that the rich will get richer as the poor get poorer, or that all the money in the world can't buy happiness or even save a loved one's life. What I don't get is how hard this movie tries to vindicate its inbuilt philosophy that only through the sacrifice of many, can a few claim the right to immorality. As that ideology is never really justified, that pillar of thought crumbles under its own weight. Then there are the plot holes. The most obvious is that if everyone is supposed to stop ageing at 25, why do most characters look well over 30? Plot holes and loose ends aside, this movie is also the mother of all clichés. Its bad enough that the very few scenes that are actually worth watching ends up as the most predictable moments in the film, corny dialogue, misplaced humor and a slight case of Robin Hood comes with it part and parcel as well. Moving on from bad to worse, Justin Timberlake is not the least bit convincing and Amanda Seyfried is eye candy as usual. Together, there is no chemistry between the two leads, so don't expect anything along the likes of Bonnie and Clyde. JT, stick to singing dude!",6,0,0,25 January 2012
Thor," Wasted Potential
","Pop Quiz: What do Hugh Jackman, Sam Worthington and Chris Hemsworth have in common? Aside from their Australian origins, these are the front men currently preferred in mega Hollywood action movies. While Jackman and Worthington have gone on to vindicate their casting power, I still feel Hemsworth has a lot of work to do as an actor, not only in playing a leading role, but also convincing the audience that he is the right person for that role. As the titled character, I seriously doubt Hemsworth has justified his role. But I don't blame him entirely. There are various areas where this film had potential but fails to deliver.From my perspective, I am still trying to figure out what all the hype is about, both pre and post release. Yes, box office returns indicate that this film is not a flop. Secondly, comparing to 2010's 'Clash of the Titans' (Sam Worthington), this film appears to be on par in terms of box office performance. But then again, should one be fooled into watching a movie just because it seems to have done well in cinemas? For this reviewer, the main failure starts with the non-engaging plot. Having defeated the Frost Giants from conquering the Nine Realms, including Earth, King Odin (Anthony Hopkins) prepares to bestow the crown of Asgard to his eldest son, Thor. During his ascension to the throne, Asgard is attacked by Frost Giants in an attempt to retrieve the source of their power, the Casket of Ancient Winters. Although they easily overpower the Frost Giants, Thor, his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and their childhood warrior friends travel to the Frost Giant's lair to defeat their leader Laufey (Colm Feore). On returning to Asgard, Thor faces the wrath of his father and King for his arrogance and insubordination, and is exhaled to Earth. As a mortal on Earth, Thor is found by an astrophysics team led by Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). Together, they arrive at a closely guarded facility where a shadow organization holds the source of Thor's power, his war hammer. Meanwhile, Asgard is under siege as Odin is pronounced dead even as Loki proclaims himself king after revealing a deep, dark secret.For a comic book adaption, 'Thor' fails to build and maintain the unique atmosphere found within the Marvel universe. On the other hand, the plot is also void of even a remote sensation of the epics found in Norse mythologies. This here is my main disappointment, as I cant seem to find enough homage to either Marvel or ancient mythologies Thor is based on. Instead, director Kenneth Branagh focuses a lot on action and CGI induced visual effects, suffocating scattered remnants of the film's original ideologies. Another disappointment is the plastic looking costumes that looks like something made for a Halloween party. Props also have a very amateur feel to it, strongly suggesting that miniatures were used. Most big budget films do use miniatures, but the trick is in not making it so obvious to the viewer. Coming from a person who has successfully adapted quite a few Shakespearean plays, Branagh has made a mess of what could have easily been an epic film.So considering all the should, would and could haves, I can't blame Hemsworth for not trying. But at the end of it all, he is just not convincing as an ancient God. Worse, his exile to Earth fails to evoke awe amongst mortal humans and is the dullest part of the movie. Again, this probably has to do with the script, but his supposed love interest with Portman's character has absolutely no on-screen chemistry. Portman on the other hand is a waste of talent in this movie and along with Skarsgård, are both underused. It a shame really, considering Portman won the Oscar for Best Actress in 2010's 'Black Swan'.Spilt milk and all, what's done is done. As Thor, Hemsworth has one chance at redemption and that will be when he teams up with a plethora of superheroes (and Hollywood A-listers) in the highly anticipated 2012 release of 'The Avengers'. Now THIS sounds more like it. Go marvel! Go Marvel!",Null,0,1,3 September 2011
The Disaster Artist," A thoroughly engaging salute to an incredibly disastrous film. How often does that happen?
","Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. Or so they say. They also say that one man's treasure is another man's garbage. Case in point was the events that led to the production of the 2003 indie film – The Room – which was made from a production budget of $ 6 million but returned only $1800 after two weeks of public screening. It was one of those 'so bad it's good' movies that over time, gained cult status for its bizarre narrative and off the wall performance by writer, producer, actor and director Tommy Wiseau. The Disaster Artist not only serves as a memoir on the making of The Room, it is unexpectedly one of the most engaging films about friendship and perhaps, over time, will even gain cult status of its own. Although The Disaster artist is intended as a biographical dramedy and succeeds as such, the film triumphs on many levels, starting with the portrayal of bromance between Tommy and his lead actor and co- producer Greg Sestero, who would later go on to chronicle events leading to the titular film. Playing the duo are the Franco brothers - Dave as Greg, and James as Tommy, with such poignancy and chemistry that we actually believe they are Tommy and Greg and want them to succeed. James Franco, known for outrageously hilarious bromance films from Pineapple Express to the bold and equally scandalous The Interview (with Seth Rogen as a frequent cohort) is in top form and perhaps his best turn as both the lead actor and director. Another rare achievement is Franko's wide range delivered in the same film. While he is absolutely hysterical throughout this film, Franco's real achievement is an auteur playing an auteur with the kind of convection that instantly makes Tommy Wiseau some sort of mystery man without solving or speculating the mystery surrounding him. But Franco is just one person. Across the length and breadth of this film, there are plenty of characters, cameos and Easter eggs in on for the ride. Yet at no point does the film seem too busy or crowded or stuffed. It gets to a point where we are not sure if we are laughing at one man's failure or one man's success at depicting another man's failure. Sure, it's a film within a film and we've seen films that are love letters to some of the greatest eras in Hollywood. What makes The Disaster Artist a remarkable standout is the fact that this is a moving and at times inspiring love letter to a film that not only flopped, but flopped spectacularly. Which is why the big beating heart of the film is its artistic calling on what perception means to the beholder. Franco and everyone else involved just found gold in what everyone else discarded as trash.",9,1,4,11 December 2017
Jersey Boys," A brilliant narration on the true cost of fame and fortune and how pain and loss can conceive everlasting music.
","There's a reason why the 1960s is widely known as the 'Golden Era' of music, specifically, the birth of what is now called Rock n Roll. Comprising of four British teenagers from Liverpool, The Beatles produced their first album (Please Please Me) in 1963 and went on to be regarded as the greatest rock and roll band of all time. But just a year earlier, in 1962, four boys from New Jersey made heads turn and girls swoon with a unique 'sound' to their music. Jersey Boys is the phenomenal true story of a 'sound' that took four boys from New Jersey's mob controlled suburbs and made them into the icons they are today – legends whose music is still celebrated more than five decades on!Produced and directed by another living legend – Clint Eastwood – Jersey Boys is a Tony Award winning Broadway and West End musical adaptation of the same name. Scripted by Woody Allen's Oscar winning collaborate Marshall Brickman (Anne Hall and Manhattan), the story benefits from a deeply dramatized account of the stage production, thus making it a biopic rather than just a musical. This is why the audience has to wait a good hour before Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young) makes our feet tap to the film's first real track: Sherry. But before we get to hear Young's remarkable rendition of Valli's incredible falsetto pitch, Brickman's story takes us through New Jersey's underworld circa. Valli is a good Italian-American kid but his friend Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) is just the opposite. They are both connected to local mobster Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken). Taking Valli under his wing, Tommy puts together a small time band but only manages mediocre returns while also moonlighting as juvenile delinquents. This changes with the arrival of Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen), a golden goose of a singer- song writer whose epiphany changes the band's name from The Four Lovers to The Four Seasons. Then, with the addition of bass guitarist and singer Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda), Sherry, their first song as a band, becomes a hit and the group is instantly catapulted into nationwide fame.By the time we get to the band's all-time number one hit single, Can't Take My Eyes Off You, there's trouble brewing. Domestic heartbreak and tragedy, ego trips and quarrels, financial crises and mob intervention turns cracks into fissures. Reminding us that this is in fact a stage show adaptation, Eastwood creates individual perceptions by allowing each member of the band to narrate his story directly to the camera. While this might seem like a theatre-cinema blending technique (ala Moulin Rouge!), it adds wholesome dimensions as a biography made for the discerning cinema audience. Adding on to that dimension is the juxtaposition of organized crime with the evolution of Doo-wop into rock and pop. In fact, there is a brief reference to Frank Sinatra, who as legendary as himself, was known to have ties with Chicago's notorious mobster Al Capone. To this effect, the story also includes real life actor Joe Pesci (Joey Russo) as a talent scout who recommends Bob to the band. Synonymous with mobster roles in previous films, Walken himself might seem like a cliché, but instead is entrusted with the film's humour and he delivers. Characterization from the rest leaves more to be desired. Young as front man Valli and Piazza as Tommy are more theatrical than expected in a film. It's a different matter when we get to see them perform as musicians – simply astonishing!That there is no reference to era specific bands like The Beach Boys or the Bee Gees can be another letdown. Instead, Brickman's script remains parallel to the stage production with emphasis on an underdog rags-to-riches plot arc. Even so, as Eastwood's first musical adaptation, Jersey Boys has more hits than misses (excuse the pun). Like the Academy Award winning Walk The Line, a lot of focus has gone into the back story by dramatizing the true cost of fame and fortune. Above all, it is a brilliant narration on how pain and loss can conceive everlasting music. And judging from the need to make this film, it's no surprise that the music of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons will always remain evergreen.",8,77,104,18 June 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Good but flawed
","Over and above the retrospective narration on 'the greatest manhunt in history', ZERO DARK THIRTY is either a finely crafted espionage drama, or a controversial piece of political propaganda, or a little bit of both. As a cinematic experience, the entertainment quotation varies depending on what you might have grown to expect from this film. And depending on that expectation, this film will either appeal to you, or turn you away in indifference.The title is military jargon for 'half past midnight'. It also refers to the time stamped go-order issued by the Pentagon, to raid a compound in Pakistan said to be housing Al-Qaeda terrorist and chief Osama bin Laden. As of 2nd May 2011, we are told that bin Laden was Allegedly eliminated by the US Navy SEALS. This film is all about the 'deductive reasoning' as one CIA official puts it, in tracking down bin Laden before he was shot to death. The film opens with a blacked out screen stating that it is based on 'first hand' accounts of actual events. In total darkness, we listen for two minutes where American citizens cry out in horror and chaos as the World Trade Centre succumbs to terrorist attacks on 11th September, 2001. Two years later, the CIA has detained Ammar, a suspect linked to Al-Qaeda terrorists in Saudi Arabia. Held at a CIA black site (a location disavowed by the US government) in Pakistan, Ammar is interrogated, tortured and humiliated until he gives CIA operative Maya (Jessica Chastain) a name – a person said to be bin Laden's courier and confidant. Working with probability on one hand and informed guesses on the other, Maya must now convince the male dominated corridors of power that the courier will lead them to bin Laden.At the time of reviewing this film, ZERO DARK THIRTY has been nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Motion Picture of the Year. I concur that this is an important film and perfectly timed as such. Over 3000 people lost their lives on the ill-fated and historically infamous 9/11 2001. Add to that hundreds of thousands more on the so called 'war on terror' and over a trillion US dollars in defense spending. But what has all this amounted to cinematically? Sure, various other films have tried to throw light on what America has done to avenge the loss of innocent lives since 9/11, but what makes this film so special? Try Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal – the production team that got 2008's similarly themed THE HURT LOCKER six Academy Awards including Best Picture. Bigelow returns as director, co-producing with returning screen writer Boal. It is fairly evident that Bigelow and Boal have pulled out all the stops in delivering a top-notch film. That said, I am still not convinced that this is the best film of 2012. My problem lies in the murky prologue and an indistinct epilogue. It is almost as if the director and the writer expected the whole world to be tuned in since 9/11. This downplays the narrative in as much as saying 'Meanwhile, in a CIA black site in Pakistan' The ending is even more annoying. Bin Laden gets his duly deserved double-tap (standard engagement procedure, none less), then what? Is the world safe from terrorism? Do the surviving dependents of thousands of slain victims find closure? Does Maya become a hero? Will the CIA recruit more women? Sadly, none of these questions are answered, and by not answering these questions, where lies the point of this film, less its making?Then there exists the controversy that becomes a thin line between fact and fiction. By claiming to have the film based on reliable sources, we are given to believe that the US government endorses torture as an enhanced interrogation technique. This part of the narrative could be over hyped if associated as the political propaganda that aided President Obama's re-election. But given that Bigelow made THE HURT LOCKER without propaganda, I am content in accepting this film as an espionage drama rather than a trigger-happy depiction vindicating the US government's trillion dollar deficit. ZERO DARK THIRTY also manages a cut above the rest if perceived for its other cinematic qualities – engaging and fast paced narrative, nail biting suspense that leads to startling moments of terror, and some fine acting chops. Jessica Chastain delivers a tour de force achievement transforming Maya into a fiery CIA officer with conviction. There is one particular scene that reminds me of a younger Meryl Streep. Ironically, bin Laden is said to have loathed women in office. By the looks of it, Chastain and Bigelow may have just sent bin Laden a whirling undercurrent to upset his watery grave. Also worth mentioning are a plethora of supporting roles. Most notable are Jason Clarke as Maya's colleague and interrogation officer, Mark Strong in a fierce pep-talk speech, and some amusing sarcasm from James Gandolfini as former CIA director Leon Panetta. The actual raid is left for the last but best thirty minutes of the film. This is also when I was pleasantly surprised with the use of some military hardware, the likes of which have remained a top secret like the elusive 'Area 51'. At least till now.",7,2,5,24 January 2013
12 Years a Slave," 12 Years a slave is more than just a milestone achievement in filmmaking. It is every bit a masterpiece as much as it is essential cinema.
","There are few films that refuse to leave a viewer's system hours and even days after they are seen. Some of these films radiate overwhelming joy, while others leave a bitter aftertaste that is hard to get rid of. 12 Years a Slave has the rare distinction of being both a triumphant story on the persistent power of the human spirit while simultaneously dwelling into the darkest recesses of the human soul. Although generally mistaken for the same thing, there is a glaring difference between the human spirit and the soul because only one of these can be tainted with racial prejudice. And that is the soul, the metaphysical constitution of a human being but that which has unlimited potential to harbour raw hate. How this hate transcends beyond cruelty is director Steve McQueen's masterstroke in this outstanding film.As a period piece set in 1841, 12 Years a Slave is a true story; a first hand account of slavery as published by Solomon Northup in an 1853 memoir of the same name. Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free man from a middle class African-American family in Saratoga, New York. His entire life changes for the worse the day he is kidnapped and shipped to plantations in the South. Here, he looses his identity, his freedom, his family, but most of all, his stature as a human being. During the course of these twelve years, Northup encounters inhumane cruelty from the day he is sold as a 'fit beast'. He is bought and sold, witnesses the rape and murder of other slaves in captivity and is all but 'broken' by his sadistic master and owner Edwin Epps (terrifyingly played by Michael Fassbender).Don't be surprised if people walk out during the show. This is not an easy film to watch, let alone digest. The depiction of cruelty is as unbelievable as it is frequently stomach knotting. There are multiple scenes of intense physical abuse that are very unforgiving for the timid viewer. But if you can stomach the violence, there are tear-jerking scenes that are equally emotionally crushing. One particular scene has a mother separated from her children when her family is sold to different slave owners. Incidentally, the slave trader who sells these slaves is played by Paul Giamatti, but the manner in which he sells his slaves has a striking similarity to the scene where he sells human 'slaves' to apes, in Planet of The Apes (2001). I'm not sure if there is a hidden message here, but I found this scene rather perplexing. Another disturbing segment is a five minute lynching scene where a slave is left hanging all through the day. This is also where the film treads into art house territory. No surprise there because like his previous films Hunger and Shame, McQueen's deft brushstrokes reveal a beautiful picture, but a picture about an ugly subject.To say that 12 Years a slave is a milestone achievement in filmmaking would only be half truth. It is every bit a masterpiece as much as it is essential cinema. From Sean Bobbitt's captivating cinematography and Hans Zimmer's moving original music, to flawless performances from an ensemble of top actors (including Paul Dano, Brad Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch in plot twisting key roles), the credit goes to everyone involved in its making. In a remarkable performance for a debut role, Mexican-Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o plays the most tragic character in the film – Patsy, a slave caught between her master's nightly visits and her master's wife's jealousy over said reason. Even so, nothing can prepare you for one of the toughest scenes in the film and this is towards the end, where Patsy, along with the audience, must endure a gruelling lesson in disobedience.Last year Daniel Day-Lewis walked away with an Academy Award for his portrayal of President Lincoln, who at the height of power, emancipated slavery. It would be a diabolical irony if the same honour is not bestowed upon Ejiofor for what is simply an outstanding portrayal of a man stripped of his basic right to be treated as a human being. Watch 12 Years a Slave, not just because it has received nine Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, but because the film challenges you to imagine the mental and physical agony of a victim of racial prejudice; Because it does this and a lot more and does not expect the viewer to rest easy during any of its 134 minutes of running time and beyond.",10,3,5,3 February 2014
Joker," Dark, gritty and unsettling but also an imaginatively bold and beautiful origins story of the Joker.
","Forget the title. Abandon everything you know about the Joker character from the Batman movies and DC Comics source material. Forget the previous screen iterations of the Joker. For just a moment, and I'll dare say, forget about the most popular and beloved version from Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. Don't even think or expect this to be a superhero movie. There are no fancy latex costumes and certainly no studio powered CGI. Made from a frugal budget and running at a healthy 120 minutes, this film doesn't promise anything you would expect in a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't ask for anything in return either. But right from the very first minute, you will be smitten, because this is essentially a story about Arthur Fleck, and not really about the Joker as we've seen before.Never heard that name before? Don't worry, no one else has. That's because almost everything about this film is fresh and reimagined; but also masked with layers of familiarity. I'm referring to a very cinematic late 1970s New York City with a distinctive Martin Scorsese vibe. And although several scenes seem to say we are watching the story unfold in Gotham City, what we see is the naked soul of New York and not DC Comics' mirror image of the former. With this comes chaos and panic in flawed, fractured, vile and unsympathetic people. Arthur Fleck doesn't believe he is one of these people. He cares for his ageing mother while trying to make ends meet as a rent-a-clown. He has dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and an encounter with TV talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) might give him half a chance at success. But no one ever said life is fair, right? Between dealing with a neurological disorder that causes uncontrollable bursts of laughter and retreating from the pain of everyday life, Arthur has to cope with being an outcast, a loner, a looser, a misunderstood bystander desperate to be accepted. If this weren't bad enough, his mother reveals a family secret that becomes a catalyst and turning point in the story.What follows is a two-pronged approach into dissecting what Arthur is becoming, while simultaneously implying why he must pursue who his father is. The answer and consequences of finding the truth is an eye-popping moment because the subject is just boldly imaginative and equally subversive to everything we think we know about the character. Which to its credit, makes this film a head-smacking original. And while the Joker is much more than an origins story, this is a film made with a lot of creative freedom, which is clearly visible in the character arc of Arthur Fleck. That means very little or no studio arm twisting to rope in the cash cow. You could say director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix as the titular character have not only reimagined the Joker from an iconic villain to devastating vigilante, they have rewritten events and characters from DC Comics into Arthur's world. In doing so, they have written and published a cinematic language that was once lost, forgotten, eroded by the cash flow that came from tentpole Hollywood blockbusters, that ironically, includes superhero films to blame.While the story is linear and simple to follow, it does everything but give you easy answers. What the film is really aiming at is the moral and mental conflict, and physical and psychological transformation of an ordinary man into a pathological killer. As this person, Joaquin Phoenix is incredibly and immensely watchable, going from childlike innocence to someone capable of unimaginable terror. Equally astonishing is his actual transformation into a sort of contortionist with a unique cackle that sounds like a crow on concentrated caffeine. You can't take your eyes off him, and while you are subconsciously aware Arthur is a work of fiction, at no point will you have the time to compare Phoenix to other actors who played the Joker. Another interesting inclusion is De Niro, who at first appears to be in a cameo role. But there is more to his inclusion than it seems. Outside throwing back to similarly introverted roles in Taxi Driver (1976) and Raging Bull (1980), as the aforementioned Scorsese psychological dramas set in New York, De Niro also has a key role in molding Arthur. You may see it coming but when it happens, it's a shocker and in itself worthy of a second viewing.Dark, gritty, and at times unsettling, this is Joaquin Phoenix like never before, and the same can be said about the new Joker; but also hauntingly beautiful and an impressive cinematic achievement. Unconcerned with any or all previous versions of the titular character, Joker will leave you with an overwhelming sense of empathy for a person just trying to fit in. If you don't see it that way, the joke's on you.",9,1,3,3 October 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Skull Island isn't impressively intelligent but it is overwhelmingly gorgeous and a kickass spectacle worthy of the big screen.
","Right from its opening scene - a cheesy montage that would come into play during the second half of the film - Kong: Skull Island is a reiteration that size matters at the movies. If BIG is what you want, then that's exactly what you get – big budget, big effects and an ape, much, much bigger than his cinematic forefathers from the 1933 classic to the 2005 epic from Peter Jackson. But unlike Jackson's bitter-sweet romanticization of beauty and the beast (which has always been at the heart of a King Kong film) Skull Island is neither a prequel nor a sequel in Kong's storyline. It isn't entirely a reboot either because none of the characters from the previous films are brought back in this film. Instead, this version feels like a pilot episode in its own cinematic universe. Set in 1973 and just after US forces have all but accepted defeat in Vietnam, we follow a group of explorers and American GIs who set out to geo-map the titular but unchartered island. Their grand entrance into the storm shrouded island is the first of a series of kickass spectacles and essentially why you would want to watch this film on the biggest screen possible. It's also the new Kong's awesome introduction in all his colossal gloryand fury. After their Hueys are extended the same welcome as annoying mosquitoes, the group is divided into two teams in an increasingly hostile environment. One team is led by John Goodman's government agent posing as a scientist along with Samuel L. Jackson in a cakewalk role as a vengeful Vietnam veteran. Led by Tom Hiddleston as a tracker and Brie Larson as a war photographer (who serves no real purpose except the tradition that Kong has a thing for blondes), the second team makes an interesting discovery – a stranded WWII pilot (John C. Reilly) is just as eager to leave the island as they are.What sets this film apart from previous Kong lore is the instantly noticeable visual splendour, an aesthetic that seems like a very obvious love letter to Apocalypse Now (1979) but mixed with the cheese and chowder of a Jurassic Park adventure. This in turn wreaks havoc on the tone of the film, resulting in constant shifts between bombastic action, dead-eye terror, pop culture, political and ecological allegories, and whimsy humour including show stealing levity from Reilly. Add to that a stellar cast stuck with stereotypical roles in a telegraphed screenplay and you get an old school monster movie mash with teeth bigger than its bite. But then, who are we kidding? Anyone paying to watch this film will expect their money's worth of copious eye candy and that's precisely what Skull Island promises in return.Despite being a novice behind the lens, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts can be credited with the creation of a tentpole film that is overwhelmingly gorgeous even if it isn't impressively intelligent. Spectacular action, photorealistic CGI, surreal cinematography, and era specific soundtrack will keep you entertained but it's the deliberate tease at the end that will leave you wanting more. If not New York, maybe Japan? Come 2020, we'll know for sure.",7,2,7,10 March 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Agatha would be aghast
","Although the story remains fairly true to the 1934 novel of the same name by Agatha Christie, this third screen adaptation (following adaptations in 1974 and 2001) is a bit of a mess. And that's putting it mildly. Worse, and as ironical as it sounds, the film loses steam even before the titular locomotive pulls out of the first act. An all- star cast lead by director Kenneth Branagh himself isn't enough, even with the latter portraying Belgian master detective Hercule Poirot who turns out to be more moustache than man. Which is sad, given that literary crime fiction has Poirot second only to Arthur Conan Doyle's super sleuth on 221B Baker Street. But in this film, Christie's most famous character is reduced to a mumbling idiot who would rather set both feet in horse poop just to make a half-baked point about order and balance. Shot on 65mm film, aerial vistas of a train trudging through the Alps sure looks pretty. The production design also boasts of lavish set pieces, plush backdrops, and costumes tailored to that era. But really, all we want is an old fashioned murder mystery. Perhaps an amazing display of deductive reasoning before arriving at a twist ending? Surely, that isn't too much to ask. Add the mouthwatering cast in a plot that thickens into one of the most ingenious yet baffling cases penned by Christie and we have a first class whodunit in this day and age of cinema. But as it turns out, this was indeed asking for too much. Like the bloodied victim, something dies very early in the film. And that's before the story starts juggling the remaining 12 suspects into the 12 agonizing labours of Hercules. Or was it Hercule? Either way, Agatha would be aghast.",4,96,169,8 November 2017
Arrival," One of the best Sci-fi films in mainstream cinema
","As an alien first contact film, Arrival isn't just an ambitious answer to an age old question 'are we alone?' its high concept thinking in presenting an answer to that question is a rarity in mainstream cinema these days. And unlike the typical bamboozle of a sci-fi blockbuster, this film isn't a thrill ride meant for 4DX cinema either. Rather, a crushing yet astute mediation on some of the biggest and perhaps oldest problems with the human race – our perception of what makes us human, our success and failure at communication and our discomposure associated with the unknown. Known for his baroque styled narration, director Denis Villeneuve is in no hurry to reveal the mystery behind seemingly random alien landings in twelve countries. The visualization of these megalith spaceships is a cinematic achievement in itself, aided with a haunting sound design engineered to raise goose bumps, but more on this later. Meanwhile, and ever the trigger-happy race, governments of these countries have already mobilised a pre-emptive strike. As expected, the United States military is also gung-ho but not before sending linguistic expert Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) into the ship to find out what they want. Working with the military (represented by Forrest Whitaker) and a theoretical physicist played by Jeremy Renner, Louise first learns their language and then discovers that it's not about what they want but why they are have come. With preceding films like Interstellar and Contact, the story here isn't really new, or even about the existence of intelligent life outside our planet. By the time Louise arrives at the astounding revelation, it dawns on the viewer that Arrival has more to do with the mysteries of our own existence, our innate ability to experience joy and sorrow, and even the incredible ability to change our own fate. Adams owns this film as much as the lines on the back of her hand. Hers is a tragic character played with conviction throughout the film, and then towards the end, hits it out of the park with a climactic moment that defines the human value of compromise. Although conceptually incredible with real life takeaways, Arrival is not perfect. For a worldwide event, the narrative is almost entirely about Louise, her deciphering of the alien language and how that information relates to the future of mankind. Supporting roles from Renner is also saved for a few scenes and also for what appears to be a paradox in the story, while Whitaker's military man is just there to throw the audience into thinking this film could end up like another misguided Prometheus. There is also a bit of slack in the pace during the middle segment that builds on the aforementioned paradox. However, this is also where we learn more about her personal loss and the impact of grief in our existence.Having said that, Arrival still has the craftsmanship of a great film that demands our full attention in return for a rewarding experience. Technical aspects are also critical to the overall production design with sound and visuals forming a skeletal binding with the story. Is it Villeneuve's magnum opus? That depends on what he does next. Until then, this is probably the best science fiction film of the decade and one of the best films of the year.",9,10,22,25 November 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman is a soulful satire that venerates cinema's artistic merits while simultaneously condemning it's contamination through commercialisation.
","If you've noticed during previous telecasts of the Academy Awards, there's always a short spoof movie they play at the beginning of the event. It's a parody of the year's top films where Hollywood lampoons itself. They just love to be at the center of the joke as long as the joke is told by them. Directed, produced and co-written by unconventional Mexican filmmaker Alejandro G Iñárritu, Birdman, sub-titled Or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, is one such wholesome parody – a pitch black satire where Hollywood makes roaring fun of Hollywood. And it's a ton of fun from the very first scene where we see Michael Keaton levitating in his underwear. Setting off a chain of parodies is Keaton playing Riggan Thompson, a washed-up middle aged actor whose last blockbuster saw him playing the titular superhero in the 1992 sequel, 'Birdman 3'. Now 20 years on, he is desperately grasping for former glory by trying to reinvent himself as a theatre artist. As the director and producer of a Broadway play, Riggan has a few problems to tackle, starting with his alter ego, the growling and grotesque voice of Birdman (also Keaton) who taunts Riggan into insecurity and regret. These are bizarre sequences and we are left guessing whether Riggan is mentally unstable or possess supernatural abilities no one else knows about. His second problem is the passive-aggressive nature of his lead actor, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton). Known for his brilliant method acting but also infamously impulsive and abrasive, Norton is another caricature of himself as Shiner, an actor whose outbursts leads to a series of disasters on the play's preview nights. With the big opening night just around the corner, Riggan is left to overcome his final obstacle – A New York Times theatre critic (Lindsay Duncun) who loathes Hollywood celebrities for commercialising and thus tainting what was once true art in theatre. One of the main parodies of this multi-layered film is the fact that the current horde of superhero films from DC Entertainment and Marvel Studios didn't quite exist until Keaton kick-started the genre in 1989 by playing the titular superhero in Batman. It gets better. Keaton hasn't been in the limelight since his 1992 blockbuster sequel, Batman Returns, the same year Riggan peaked in his acting career. Coincidence? Not really. Such is the ingenuity of this film but Keaton and Norton aren't the only ones lampooned and we'll get to that later. Comprising of an ensemble cast, Iñárritu has plenty on offer and they all deliver in uniformity starting with Emma Stone as Riggan's feisty daughter and assistant, Zach Galfianakis as his best friend and manager, Naomi Watts as his lead actress on her first Broadway show, and Amy Ryan as his ex-wife and voice of reason. Why Birdman will be an Academy Award magnet is obvious. Besides Keaton's comeback of the century and Norton's outstanding delivery, this film is theoretically a movie within a movie and thematically about an actor making a comeback. That's ample flattery to win over The Academy and precisely why The Artist went Oscar crazy in 2011. But irrespective of how this film fares at the 2015 Academy Awards, the real pull is how intensely immersive this film is in creativity, imagination, performance and technical excellence. After winning an Academy Award for last year's Gravity, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki is back with more wizardry by shooting the entire film in one continuous take; Seamless digital binding, yes, but otherwise impossible to achieve conventionally. And bolstering the pace is some fantastic music from composer Antonio Sanchez who uses just percussion instruments with perfect timing. That Iñárritu ends the film with ambiguity could be received with mixed reactions. Like Christopher Nolan before, Iñárritu leaves it open to interpretation and that's always a good thing when giving a film a long lasting impression. Thoroughly entertaining with endless hilarity, both slapstick and dark, Birdman plays on cinema's artistic merits while simultaneously condemning it's contamination through commercialisation. To this effect there's a mini action scene dedicated to the kind of profound stupidity found in a Michael Bay film. Another shot of a meteor plummeting to Earth speaks volumes about the death of stardom and the birth of insanity. If you look closely at the fire ball, you can almost see Bay's name on it.",10,8,19,15 December 2014
The Conjuring," To Hell and Back.
","Not since THE EXORCIST (1973) has a horror film been this effective. If you could bottle an atmosphere of dread, suspense and terror, and sell it to the whole world, the label on that bottle would read THE CONJURING. Director James Wan has done just that. That being said, when it comes to the horror genre, Hollywood has been peddling various versions of this bottle for decades. Typically, Hollywood horror films have always had precious little to offer other than survival horror that relies on excessive bloodletting, and this – demonic possession or human casualties caught up in the eternal war between Heaven and Hell. Starting with SAW and then INSIDIOUS, Wan is not new to horror movies. But while he was merely flexing his muscles with those films, THE CONJURING is a film assembled piece by piece, where each piece is a meticulously crafted block of shock. Using an old school template of retro scare tactics, Wan ups the ante (and the hairs on your neck) by narrating what is supposed to be a true story, which until now, was hushed by skeptics. Set in 1971 Rhode Island, the epilogue introduces us to Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), real life demonologists who lecture university students when they are not investigating paranormal behavior. They even have a large room full of relics from their ghost-busting escapades to the effect that Ed feels it's best to keep evil locked up collectively, than let loose individually. It is at one of these lectures when they meet Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston), new owners of an old farmhouse. Within hours of moving into their dream home, the Perrons and their five daughters experience increasing malevolence that leads them to seek out the Warrens. Despite being regarded as experts in their field, nothing can prepare the Warrens for what happens next. Based on multiple interviews with the real Lorraine Warren, sibling screenwriters Chad and Carey Hayes' story is straight forward and well paced, while also allowing viewers to breathe thanks to some will timed wit. I wouldn't call this humor, rather perfectly timed breaks that prepare you for the next fright scene. And while most of the cast are well suited for the story, Taylor stands out in illustrating the Warren's three-step theory on demonic possession – Infestation, Oppression and Possession. Personally, I was expecting all the action to come from Wilson and Farmiga, and even as they deliver, Taylor's Lili becomes the central character in a manner that justifies why this story had to be told. Owing to a setup that is not the most original, THE CONJURING does have its flaws and horror fans will run through the clichés with repetition and familiarity; a big house that a realtor will give away for a steal; kids talking to people no one can see; banging doors and frosty whispers; it's all there and it's safe to say that Wan has borrowed some of the best moments from classic horror films and thrown it all into a huge cauldron. But it works. Using lingering moments of deliberate silence and scaring you with things you don't actually see, Wan's slow build up is an unending reign of terror even when you know what to expect. And if some of the early scares seem cheap, this is only a warning for viewers to brace themselves for the heart-stoppers saved for later. These moments are cranked up with menacing background music and a nerve racking sound design engineered to raise those goose bumps.As modern horror movies go, it takes a lot to scare people who have seen everything from Hitchcock's PSYCHO (1960) to the recent remake of THE EVIL DEAD. It also goes without saying that expectations are now inversely proportional to a rising level of skepticism. Even so, that is no excuse to underestimate this film. There is a reason why THE CONJURING has an R rating (Restricted Viewing - Children under 17 require parent or adult guardian) even though there is no sexual content or profanity, with little blood and violence. Besides being labeled as a true story, Wan's narration, build-up and the overall atmosphere generated can get under your skin. Quite literally, this film can take you to hell and back. Just ensure it's not a one way trip!",8,0,2,28 August 2013
Prometheus," Ridley the Riddler
","From reviews I have read to my own experience watching this movie, I gather there are two distinct groups within the audience. In other words, this is a 'love it' or 'hate it' movie. Like it or not, its either 'yes or no' with only a minority stuck in between. I for one find myself within this minority. Borrowing from Greek mythology where demigod Prometheus was venerated by ancient Greeks in their quest for scientific progression, but feared as an idol of overindulgence and unforeseen consequences, director Ridley Scott's narration finds itself within a very similar paradigm. Conceptually, the film and its core message is the same as being told to be cautious when wishing for something to happen or materialize. It shares the same mythical philosophy as when Pandora opened the box, or biblically, when Adam in his greed for knowledge, ate from the forbidden tree. Set in 2089, it is within this premise where a group of scientists connect the dots to reveal a star map that interprets an invitation to the origins of mankind. We are first introduced to the android David (Michael Fassbender) as he monitors the flight path of the USS Prometheus, travelling at the speed of light. Mission director Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), followed by archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) awake from a state of stasis hibernation, just as Prometheus approaches orbital range of their destination – LV223. After touching down near a monolithic structure, Shaw leads a team of explores in search of clues for alien life forms. As the tagline suggests, what they find not only jeopardizes the safety of the crew, but the entire human race. Like Fox Mulder of 'The X Files', I wanted to believe. If James Cameron has vested considerable time and money into exploring mysteries of the deepest oceans, I wanted to believe Ridley Scott was on a similar quest, but in the opposite direction. This was probably due to the immense hype made possible through word of mouth alone, and all before the official worldwide premier. We knew Scott was working on something so big, it had every prospect of becoming his masterpiece, not to mention him standing shoulder to shoulder with titans like Steven Spielberg, James Cameron and Peter Jackson. Sadly, and for obvious yet unbelievable reasons, 'Prometheus' will always remain Scott's big catch that got away before the haul in. From my experience, it was like watching two very different movies. The first hour is a phenomenal piece of cinematic creation with fantastic visuals, ground breaking art direction, captivating atmosphere, and a mysterious story that boldly places us on the verge of THE biggest discovery since mankind learnt the use of fire. What happens during the second hour is a real shame if you ask me, considering Scott's nuance behind the groundbreaking 'Blade Runner' (1982). The culprit is a fractured script that goes from phenomenal to ludicrous, thanks to the literary creativity (or lack of) of Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof. It is all the more annoying because this film blasts off to a brilliant start, and then out of nowhere, falls out of the sky because it only had half a tank of fuel to begin with. Then there are the astounding questions asked that never receive a plausible answer. This can be frustrating for certain sections of the audience but leaving those questions open-ended also makes the film intriguing but only for a few questions that are attempted with an answer. Ultimately, the final blow comes in the genre-altering second half, changing the story from sci-fi mystery to predictable sci-fi horror, and somewhere in between throws at the audience the notion that scientists, astronauts, and intellectuals of similar caliber lack basic common sense. In all its worth, Fassbender is just about the only actor to look forward to as the calm yet eerie android, who ironically has more soul than most other characters. Rapace comes in at a close second, but given the built-in trend of all the 'Alien' movies where a female protagonist uses every ounce of strength and courage to survive, Sigourney Weaver remains my favorite alien butt kicker of all time. As a bold and visually stunning narration that tries to answer some of the questions that have been haunting mankind since we discovered the presence of celestial bodies, Scott can be credited with the overall aesthetics of this film. However, in staying true to the genre, this is not the best we have seen from the legend that is Ridley Scott.",6,4,6,17 June 2012
The Woman in Black," Another vengeful evil spirit
","Even before J K Rowling started work on her last Harry Potter novel, questions were raised as to what lay ahead for Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. For child actors who grew into immense fame and fortune overnight, industry pundits have assumed that the trio would need more than a magic wand to woo audiences that are not Harry Potter fans. To his advantage, Radcliffe appears to be burning bridges between Hogwarts and the real world that exists beyond. For his first major role outside the highly protective dome of a $7 billion (global box-office) film franchise, Radcliffe may be on the right path to disproving the theory that child actors seldom make the transition from juvenile charm to crowd pulling adult stars.Set during the early 20th century in Edwardian England, Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer haunted by the tragic loss of his wife during childbirth. Struggling with this troubled past and stress from his law firm boss, Kipps is sent to handle the estate of the Late Alice Drablow. Before Kipps has a chance to recover Drablow's last will and testament, he is intimidated by townsfolk who consider his arrival as a bad omen. Sure enough, bad things start to happen, including apparitions of a woman dressed in black and the mysterious death of random children. Along with his only friend Sam Daily (Ciarán Hinds), Kipps digs deeper into the unknown before arriving at a perilous yet shocking revelation.In keeping with the genre, director James Watkins' final product is nothing new with a central plot that appears to stem from a cross between 'Friday the 13th' and 'The Ring' – both horror films with a central theme of malevolent vengeance. That being said, pivotal to the fright factor is Watkins' use of perfectly timed suspense. Even so, predictability is on a tight leash, allowing the viewer little chance of preparing for a frightening moment. My only problem is that these moments, though scary, are few and scattered. Although this may have been intentional, it's fair to say that pacing and a darkening tone more than makes up with never a dull moment. The story is also engaging right from the very first scene and it soon becomes clear who the woman is black is. Central to the plot, and the mystery, is why she does what she does and the motive behind her evil vengeance.Shouldering the bulk of the story, Radcliffe is not exactly phenomenal, but neither does he stick out like a sore thumb either. If this movie is any indication, it's safe to say that Radcliffe has broken free of the Harry Potter mold with distinctive promise as an up-and- coming actor. On the other hand, as a horror film with a supernatural premise, there is more to be desired. For a remake adapted from Susan Hill's novel of the same name, this film offers some truly jumpy moments by trading chilling atmosphere in favor of intentionally pulling the rug under the viewer. Not to say that this film is completely void of a creepy atmosphere, its just that Watkins seems to have placed all his chips on fright tactics rather than focusing on making the entire film a disturbing experience for the viewer. This becomes evident right from the start and each time you jump off your seat, it's like hearing a prankster say 'gotchya!' Towards the end, I was starting to get an unnerving feeling that Watkins intended to terrorize the audience more than central characters in the movie. Fair enough for a horror movie, but you'll get my point with the very last scene, echoing the words 'you're next!'",6,0,0,15 May 2012
X-Men: First Class," X Men :First Class ushers in the 2011 summer action mania.
","Every year, a highly anticipated movie officially launches the summer action fiesta. For 2011, this is it! Look no further, X-men: First Class has thrown the gates openwide open.In almost unaltered history, the film dates back to the early 1960s era of suspense and dread. John F Kennedy is the president of the United States of America and the whole world braces for what is sure to be nuclear Armageddon. If you are thinking 'Cuban Missile Crisis', then I have your attention. However, before the world got to this predicament, we need to go back to the European theatre of World War II. In a concentration camp at Auschwitz, Occupied Poland, young Erik Lehnsherr witnesses his mother's brutal murder. During this traumatic event and fuelled by anger, Erik unleashes his secret power-much to the amazement of the perpetrator, Doctor Sebastian Shaw. Across the Atlantic, a young Charles Xavier discovers powers of his own. Before long, Xavier is a distinguished academic living with the shape-shifting Raven (who would later renegade and be called Mystique). Dedicating his life to avenging his mother's death, Erik Lehnsherr bumps into Charles Xavier, spawning an instant friendship and powerful bond. Together, and with their mutant friends, they are the CIA's last hope in averting a nuclear crisis that culminates into a spectacular face-off between American and Soviet naval forces.With all due respect, Mathew Vaughn does a phenomenal job as the director of this prequel. But fans of the Marvel comic book and the X-Men franchise will always look back to Bryan Singer for giving us the first two titles: X-Men (2000) and X2: X-Men United (2003). In fact, this installment is almost entirely the handy work of Singer, who not only co-wrote the script, but also produced the film. What he did not do was direct the movie, and that was a last moment decision due to pre-committed schedules for filming Jack the Giant Killer. So, having received the raw materials on a silver platter, all Vaughn had to do was execute it, take for take. In doing so, Vaughn has successfully re-vamped the X-Men franchise with such grandeur, a spin-off trilogy has already found its way to the drawing boards. On the whole, everything works here; from a captivating and intelligent screenplay to exceptional character development to fantastic action sequences. Whether you are a Marvel comic-book fan, X-Men movie fan or an action movie junkie, right from the start, through the 130 minutes to the end, you are sure to be entertained. Visuals are top notch, oozing CGI in many scenes. And to think, Vaughn has pulled this off without the need of those cumbersome 3D Spectacles. As a prequel, the script is pure ingenuity and takes us back to a time before Erik and Charles became the archenemies we know them to be. It is also a time when mutants are discovering and practicing their powers in secret. Aside from the mutant origins, embedded in the script is a parallel history relating to the Cuban Missile Crisis and birth of the Civil Rights Movement. The ingenuity of this is grafting history with fiction and having the audience accept its plausibility without having to state it as based on actual events. Forrest Gump was the first film to have pulled that off. First Class builds on this concept in such a clever way, that the script is studded with historical events. Another aspect of the screenplay also brings to mind a distinct James Bond theme. Maybe it is just the opinion of this reviewer, but chronologically, Bond's cinematic debut (1960s) is around the same time frame scripted for this movie. It is left to be seen if Vaughn intended for this as a mild undertone. Onto star performance, and most notable for his role as the young doctor in The last King of Scotland, James McAvoy is nothing like the Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) we have seen before. McAvoy's Xavier is drastically different, egotistical, brash, and a flirt on the loose. On the other hand, Michael Fassbender dons Sir Ian McKellan's suit as Erik Lehnsherr. Like McAvoy, he too 'paints a fresh canvas' for the character who would go on to become the ruthless 'Magneto'. Although McAvoy and Fassbender are perfectly cast, I have to say the latter has the edge in terms of drawing you in. In doing so, he never steps on McKellan's toes, but brings out an unseen side of Erik Lehnsherr. When I mentioned James Bond earlier, I was referring to Fassbender; for some reason, his character carries a distinctive MI-6 persona. Another worthy mention should go to Kevin Bacon as the villainous Shaw. I don't want to spoil the surprise, but Bacon's Shaw plays a key role in bringing the world to the brink of war. For the time period portrayed, Kevin Bacon is the only actor whose character dons an accent. In doing so, he almost gets his German and Russian accents to a believable level. Perhaps, Vaughn did not feel the actors needed to work on their accent and that could be why none of the other actors actually bothered with an accent suiting the setting. Aside from McAvoy, Fassbender and Bacon, watch out for a plethora of good contributions from January Jones, Jennifer Lawrence, Zoë kravitz and loads more as newly discovered mutants along with cameos from Oliver Plat, Michael Ironside and you guessed it, Hugh Jackman. For a summer opener, X-Men: First Class does not disappoint. As a prequel, it pushes boundaries, raises the bar and broadens the scope of expanding this franchise. At a time when all we see are sequels and 3D gimmicks, this film is a surefire summer winner. If you have been following the series, you will love First Class. If you haven't, don't worry, Vaughn and Singer have successfully re-booted a dying franchise; there will be more to come.",8,2,5,17 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Just a notch below expectation.
","Initially deprived of this screening, audiences in the UAE had to wait an agonizingly long month more than most other parts of the world. But was it worth the wait? That depends. Batman fanboys will find this movie has the most intricately woven plot structure of the trilogy. The dialogue heavy first hour is questionable, yet makes for concrete character build-up with perfectly punctuated throwbacks to the preceding films as well as Gotham City's DC origins. It is eight years since our caped crusader was framed by The Joker. Slain district attorney Harvey Dent is a revered hero for eradicating organized crime. Bruce Wayne is now a recluse with his alter ego a fading memory. Wayne Enterprises is on the verge of bankruptcy having invested in a sustainable energy source with disastrous potential. During all this, Gotham's underbelly rises from the shadows, led by a new and powerful insurgent known only as Bane. This second half, with Bane literally in explosive control, is when returning director Christopher Nolan gives this finale an epic, full-bodied, and raw closure. While 'The Avengers' is still fresh in memory, it now seems like popcorn entertainment in comparison to Nolan's colossus here. That being said, this difference in scale is also the jarring disparity between entertainment, satisfaction and disappointment. And believe me, any way you look at it, there are disproportionate amounts of all three, all through the movie. To begin with, a lot relies on bringing the audience up to speed with Wayne's need to vanquish crime. Why he does it, the manner in which he does it, and the whole ethos of hiding behind a mask. In a brutally painful illustration, it dawns on Wayne (and the audience) that Batman is less of a superhero than he is a livid vigilante with endless pocket money. For good measure, Bane also goes to the extent of proving that Batman is after all, an aging mortal. But just as Bruce Wayne has his reasons in doing what he does, so does Bane. This, in my opinion, is where Nolan's co-scripting philosophies hit the mark. Unlike previous antagonists, Bane is not a maniacal villain or even a super-criminal, but as brilliantly depicted by Tom Hardy (and voiced), an oppressed terrorist whose precarious nature would have given Osama bin Laden nightmares!Cinematically speaking, there are some spectacular moments but refurbished if you will, off Nolan's fantastic action sequences from 'The Dark Knight', essentially making this finale an intense action-drama, where drama has the lion's share of the plot. New to the series is over an hour of original IMAX format shot over various locales in UK, USA and India, making this an obvious IMAX choice for maximum viewing pleasure. As expected, aiding supporting roles are a plethora of top talents returning, but with less screen time in favor of new characters, including police officer John 'Robin' Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a breakthrough performance), Anne Hathaway as jewel thief Selina Kyle aka Catwoman, and a pivotal character revealed to be a direct descendant of Ra's al Ghul.'The Dark Knight Rises' could have been a genre defining finale for Nolan and the team had it not been for the low-beat first half. When the pace does pick up, the story catapults at breakneck speed but results in a rushed ending. Does this say something about a muddled effort in editing the plot's time compression? Probably; how else can you compact bits and pieces borrowed from DC's countless volumes and then present it without any of the original humor. Another personal disappointment is the underdeveloped Catwoman. Hathaway's Kyle is a super thief with a conscience but not one with a curvy catwalk. No purr either. Finally, last minute plot-twists and a butter-finger countdown cliché reiterate the fact that the Hollywood strain is inherent, no matter how you mask it. All considered, Chris Nolan has closed this chapter on a high note, albeit with subtle opening for an off-shoot, should the next director rise to the challenge. Until next summer, when Nolan's ingenuity is fused with Zack Snyder's visual aplomb in 'Man of Steel', we accept the fact that Marvel and 'The Avengers' remain undisputed with a definitive edge in all-rounded entertainment for the masses.",7,3,8,21 August 2012
Creed II," Creed II isn't as impressive as its predecessor, but it's a film Rocky fans cannot miss.
","At a time when Hollywood is increasingly dependent on CGI fueled blockbusters about saving the world (is it seven superhero films for 2018?), it's always a joy when an old franchise has something new to offer, much like an unexpected visit from an old friend. Right from the first Rocky film in 1976, almost every film in the franchise has managed to raise a lump in your throat. That's because the Rocky films, though fictional, have maintained an almost true to life timeline of characters for over two generations. Fans will also tell you that the Rocky films, especially the first two, were less about boxing and more about two conflicted individuals who find happiness and then closure in each other. Somewhere along, we felt a kinship while forgetting that these were just characters played by actors. Then came Creed, an unexpected but wonderful film that many believed to be a spin-off in the right direction. But as much as we enjoyed that film, little did we know (or even foresee) that this was the padded beginning of the end of a beloved 40-year-old franchise.Part of what made Creed immensely watchable was the gaping wounds in Michael B. Jordan's Adonis Johnson, the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. This sequel digs deeper into those wounds and even rubs it with salt. But those wounds don't belong to Donnie alone. Opening in Ukraine, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) - the former Russian boxer who left Apollo dying in Rocky's arms in Rocky IV - is training his son Victor for a grudge match against Donnie. Whatever political undertone there was in the Raegan era 1985 film is left unexplored, instead, we are given to understand that Drago has been living in scorn for the last 30 odd years. Following the defeat at the end of Rocky IV, his wife left him and Victor, and the USSR has despised him for losing to the Americans. His only chance at redeeming himself is by using Victor to challenge Donnie, who is now the new WBC Heavyweight Champion. Although clearly outmatched in strength, height, reach and even weight, Donnie accepts the challenge. Eye for an eye maybe, but a recipe for disaster as Rocky puts it.While Creed II might seem like a double-edged revenge film at first, its true intention is more about closure. New director Steven Caple Jr. gives this film a visual grandiose that surpasses its predecessor but only so much. It's bigger, longer, meaner, and stitched together with narrative clichÃ©s, but also reminds us of the frailty of relationships. This is well appointed in the effortless chemistry between Jordan and Thompson (returning as girlfriend Bianca) and between Jordan and Stallone in several scenes. Yet, the best and most tense moment in the film is a sort of face-off between Stallone and Lundgren at Rocky's restaurant. Drago blames Rocky for ruining his life. He also notices there are no pictures of him or the fight in Russia on the restaurant wall. For just a moment, you think they will pummel each other again. The story captures a lot of mental and emotional turmoil in Drago, who is thankfully not the campy villain he was in Rocky IV but a man who must make things right for himself and his son.Ryan Coogler's Creed was a near masterpiece in not only reviving an ageing franchise, but also giving it a fresh new narrative. The fight scenes were tense and exceptional, a feat Coogler repeated with Jordan in Black Panther. The fight scenes in this sequel are satisfying at best, safe at worst. To be fair, sophomore director Caple Jr. had big shoes to fill, and it shows. Like Rocky II, Creed II has its merits but also its flaws. It also shows that this is a film written and produced in the way fans would expect. While this could spawn a whole new generation of fans, there's also a danger to the original franchise. The danger is that we may never see Rocky (the character) again and as played by Stallone. If that happens, this film would be Stallone's last outing as Rocky. And if that's the case, we either didn't see it coming or they completely ignored a swan song in favour of fan service. Either way, not to be missed for Stallone alone. Good bye Rocky!",7,0,2,29 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Bland and chaotic, Batman V Superman is another example reiterating just how inferior DC is to Marvel films.
","For the hordes of comic book fans and the millions that will swarm multiplexes this weekend, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice has a lot to offer but perhaps a little too much. That's the biggest problem with this film – the problem of plenty; and there are plenty of problems.Starting with that mixed message in the title, the entire film feels like an array of events that doesn't add up to the sum of its parts. So to establish the first part of that title, the narrative takes a long time setting up a ferocious enmity between two of the most popular superheroes in the DC Comics universe. But before they start pummeling each other, prepare to spend over two hours trying to figure out exactly what the heck is going on. It doesn't help that the story, up until that point, is a patchwork of incoherence in time and place. Part of that problem is how serious this film tries to be. Look no further than the recent and exceptionally well made Deadpool, Marvel's game changer in superhero films. As a stark comparison, there is absolutely no humour or joy to be found in this film, owing to which, returning director Zack Snyder's offering is a visual and tonal bleach, and as captivating as a black and white photo of a rainbow. Now throw in Snyder's penchant for slow motion shots (I counted three scenes of shell casings hitting the ground in slomo), annoying lens flare and the shaky cam effect, in addition to watching this in 3D and you can expect no less than a disorienting headache.Equally futile is the writing and how this is edited into the storyline. Chronologically, Batman V Superman begins during the final battle between Superman and General Zod in Man of Steel. We see this from the perspective of Bruce Wayne, and he's furious that civilians are caught up in the ensuing collateral damage. Or is he jealous that he is no longer the only superhero in town? That's an important question and we'll get to that later. Meanwhile, what should have been a seamless continuation from the previous film begins with an introduction to Wayne's childhood tragedy. This is how the film opens, yet the intent is not meant to be a refresher to Batman's origins. Since we already know how his parents died, the only other reason I can think of is how his mother's name is used to determine the outcome of the titular battle. Right off the bat (excuse the pun) I'll say that this is the pinnacle of all that is dumb in the film and one of several face-palm moments.Dumbing it down further, Batman V Superman has a lot of characters and instances that are absolutely vague. Additionally, a lot of the running time is used to telegraph upcoming spin off films. This is evident when Wayne acquires classified information on metahumans (DC's version of mutants), one of which is the age defying Wonder Woman squeezed in as eye candy. Several more appear in single scenes but their inclusion is nothing more than a heads-up to kick start 2017's Justice League films; in other words, DC's lobbying to Marvel's Avengers. Therein lies the second part of the title – Dawn of Justice. DC's struggle to play catchup is as evident as the bland delivery from everyone in the film. Henry Cavill looks great in the Superman suit. That's it. Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luther is never the super villain he is meant to be (try a cross between the Joker and the psychotic Penguin). Amy Adams as Lame (or is it Lois) Lane walks around with a mystery bullet for two- thirds of the film. And Ben Affleck as the new Batmanwell maybe there's scope for a better written spin off. Until then it suffices to say that Ben was better when he was blind as a bat.For fanboys, it doesn't matter which T-shirt you wear to the cinema. DC's acronym might as well read 'Disappointment Continues'. That's ample reason to lose your shirt.",4,7,35,24 March 2016
Monsters University," Entertaining and Visually Stunning
","Everyone who watched and enjoyed Pixar Animation Studios' fourth and highly successful production MONSTERS, INC. (2001) are in for a treat with MONSTERS UNIVERSITY – an equally entertaining, visually stunning production that is as whimsical and engaging as the former. Given the growing trend in origin stories, this prequel works by keeping the story in tune with the times but suggestively aimed at a vast yet specific demographic: young minds who are about to experience all the highs and lows of college life. Preceded by THE BLUE UMBRELLA, a short film that flexes Pixar's photorealistic prowess, MONSTERS UNIVERSITY begins by introducing us to Mike Wazowski, a green eyeball who dreams of being employed at Monsters Inc – a factory that powers the city of Monstropilis by sending monsters to gather energy generated by terrifying human children. Knowing that he doesn't have what it takes to be an effective 'scarer', Mike joins the titular university and on day one, forms a rivalry with James 'Sully' Sullivan, an intimidating and overconfident behemoth of a monster. What follows is a fun filled farce where Mike and Sully must lead Oozma Kappa, a fraternity of monster misfits through a series of challenges, but not before learning to appreciate each other's redeeming qualities first. One of the biggest challenges for director and co-scripter Dan Scanlon (Storyboard artist for Pixar's CARS) was to make this second installment interesting as everyone knows how the film is going to end. This then becomes highly predictable for returning viewers who already know Mike and Sully to be inseparable friends. Another problem is the fact that children are easily bored with repetition and that is probably why CARS 2 threw Pixar into a nose dive. Against all these odds, Scanlon's nuance is in keeping this film fresh with loads of gags and witty one-liners aimed at both children and grownups. Not forgetting the college going populous, there are also satirical pokes at various frat movies like REVENGE OF THE NERDS (1984) and CARRIE (1976) and even references to recent films like OCEANS 13. The film also benefits from Billy Crystal and John Goodman reprising their roles as Mike and Sully, in addition to Steve Buscemi, Charlie Day and Helen Mirren lending their voices to some of the most vibrant characters ever created in an animation. Watch out for Terry Perry (Sean Hayes and Dave Foley), a two-headed monster with one body and two notorious brains!MONSTERS UNIVERSITY works as a perfect prequel even if you have not seen the 2001 original. Yes, there are moments that could have done with an extra dollop of the Crystal-Goodman chemistry from the original, but this is more than compensated with the inclusion of fresh new 'monsters' made possible by an impressive list of fantastic voice talents. The story not only brings back some of our favorite characters from the original, but also fits snugly within parent company Disney's tradition of imparting moral messages for the whole family. There is a lot of heart and it beats at an overwhelming pace. Overall, kids will love it, parents will chuckle, and then fumble with their wallets come time for a trip to the toy store. I can also picture Steve Jobs smiling down on his legacy, and that is the touch of warmth and joy bustling in every Pixar production; this film included.",7,0,0,7 September 2013
The Deer Hunter," An Everlasting Classic
","The Vietnam War which lasted 15 years and ended in 1975, proved to be one of the costliest wars of our time considering its five million casualties, including the lives of over 60,000 US soldiers. Who won that war is no longer important, but the effect that war has to this day is beyond devastating. In what is easily the best and last significant film of his career, director Michael Cimino delivers a film with a prophetic vision just three years after the war ended, and is the first in a string of Vietnam war movies that is still attempted over three decades on.Having also co-written the screenplay, Cimino's story does not entirely focus on battle scenes or the war itself, but in essence, its aftermath on the lives of ordinary people. For this, his narrative spans three hours, of which the first hour is spent in impeccable character development formally introducing his Russian-American characters in a small Pennsylvanian steel-mill suburb.Mike, Nick, Steven, Stanley and John are five buddies in a typical frat-pack where after work hours are spent in male bonding activities of deer hunting and beer lounging. Their last gathering as a group is at Steven's Russian orthodox wedding reception pending Mike, Nick and Steven's enlistment in the Vietnam War. The wedding is a fun filled extravaganza where everyone has more than a good share of the festivities. Yet tell-tale signs of a devastating future are cleverly manifested through the reception, foretelling that things would never be the same again. Cut to war-torn Vietnam, Mike, Nick and Steven are POWs after a short battle sequence succumbing to North Vietnamese guerrilla tactics. Taking advantage over their captor's sadistic torture methods of Russian Roulette and rat infested imprisonment, the trio makes for a daring escape little knowing their physical and mental scars would haunt them for life. In a botched rescue attempt, their party is split and they never really regroup as before the war. Although welcomed back a hero, Mike finds it hard to adjust to his once perky lifestyle. Steven is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair living in total refusal of his family and friends. The crux of the plot surfaces when Mike goes all the way back to hellish Saigon in keeping his earlier promise where he would never leave Nick behind. What he finds is a ghastly excuse for a lifelong friend who has no recollection of their history. Worse, Nick is involved in a major gambling syndicate the likes of which still disturbs Mike: Russian roulette. Interestingly enough, Francis Ford Coppola brought out the critically acclaimed APOCALYPSE NOW just a year after this film, winning two Oscars in the process for his version of the horrifying atrocities during the war in Vietnam. Though Coppola focused mainly on the war, Cimino's film, metaphorically speaking, is an integration of three acts where graphic scenes in Vietnam form the repugnant sausage in an otherwise edible hotdog. And to think, this film was made thirty years before STOP-LOSS and HOME OF THE BRAVE, similar films about war veterans incapable of reverting to ordinary life. But Cimino had already set the tone of things to come, bagging five Academy Awards including 'Best Picture' and 'Best Director' out of five nominated categories. The Oscar for 'Best Actor in a Supporting Role' also went to Christopher Walken for his outstanding role as Nick. Incidentally, this is Walken's first and only Oscar till date. Having secured an Oscar for his supporting role as the young Vito Corleone in Coppola's THE GODFATHER II and nominated for best supporting actor in the Martin Scorsese 1976 cult classic TAXI DRIVER, it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro was also nominated again for 'Best Actor in a Leading Role' as Mike. Perhaps playing a mentally unstable Vietnam Veteran in TAXI DRIVER was all the training he required in adapting a similar themed role as the titled deer hunter. Also worth mentioning is a stunning Meryl Streep in her first ever Oscar nominated role as Linda, a passive women caught between Nick's proposal for marriage and Mike's shy charm. Also embedded in the support line up are John Savage as Steven, George Dzundza as the over eccentric John and John Cazale who passed away shortly after his role as Stanley.More than just a multi-award winning movie, this is one of De Niro's and Walken's building blocks to their currently much deserved status as Hollywood veterans. But wrapping up the perfect package goes to Cimino's credit in consideration of the lack of eye-popping special effects of Hollywood yester years. His reliance on stellar acting, perfectly timed suspense in a visionary plot and the birth of a sub-genre ahead of its time justifies why the American Film Institute has praised this film within the '100 Greatest American Movies of all time'.",8,0,3,30 April 2013
Identity," An unpredictable, shocking, thrilling, edge-of-your-seat twister.
","I am hard pressed to maintain a sterile review without giving away spoilers because IDENTITY is filled with surprises, twists and shocks that even veteran film critics did not see coming. Ten years after watching this film, I watched it again and believe me, I enjoyed this roller-coaster of a movie just like I did the first time. Inspired by Agatha's Christie's 'And Then There Were None', Michael Cooney's phenomenal story will have you strapped in your seat from the gruesome beginning all through to the gruesome end. The setup is a desolate motel in the Nevada desert where ten strangers will face their darkest and final hours, all before the night is over. Lashed by a violent thunderstorm, the motel comes alive when a man (John C. McGinley) rushes in seeking urgent medical attention for his wife (Leila Kenzie). By his side is their little boy Timothy (Bret Loehr). The family is helped by a limo driver (John Cusack) and a reluctant movie star (Rebecca DeMornay) he was driving before coming to their aid. A cop (Ray Liotta) transporting a chained prisoner (Jake Busey) also stops for the night. The downpour also sweeps in a newly married couple (William Lee Scott and Clea DuVall) and a Las Vegas prostitute (Amanda Peet). With the phone lines down and electricity on the blink, they prepare to wait out the storm. Elsewhere, convicted serial killer Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is about to be executed when his psychiatrist Dr. Mallick (Alfred Molina) discovers a journal. Rivers' journal throws new light on his conviction and Mallick calls for an eleventh-hour hearing on preventing the execution. Meanwhile our guests at the motel are being killed in a peculiar pattern, one by one, by an unknown murderer. As they turn on each other to unmask the killer, director James Mangold opens a huge can of perfectly blended suspense and mystery while leaving the viewer with some very unavoidable questions. Is it the prisoner? Is it the weird motel clerk? Is it a character lurking in the shadows? And the most baffling question of all – What is the connection between Malcolm Rivers' hearing and the on-going butchery in a motel set in an entirely different location? Believe it or not, these are questions Mangold and Cooney have cleverly crafted just to pull the rug under your feet. Even if you have been watching and listening carefully, there is only the slimmest possibility you will find the answers before the director starts to untangle the mystery. This revelation is set at the beginning of the third act, with 30 minutes or so remaining, but perfectly timed to have the viewer's thoughts racing back to the beginning. Of course, by this time you will have either figured it out or you will be defenseless for Mangold's final blow. This is also when the narrative shifts from a whodunit to pure psychological horror with an omnipresent trace of the supernatural. Leading an all-star cast, Cusack does a sensational job and along with Peet (they would co-star again in the apocalyptic 2012) maintains the sheer momentum of this plot twister. Liotta, Busey and John Hawes (as the motel clerk) add to the mystery but as you will find, these are small but vital blips in the bigger picture. In all, everyone does their part and at times appear to be a bit comical with characters shouting and screaming in tandem with the rising tension. Even so, this is merely the calm before the storm while the director gives you a little time to take in what is happening. If you liked the way THE SIXTH SENSE or SESSION 9 came crashing down on you, IDENTITY will do the same but the surprises keep coming at you instead of just one major twist reserved for the end. I think I have said enough. Anymore and I might give into the temptation of revealing the film's darkest but well kept secrets.",8,2,2,26 March 2013
Lucy," Although lacking logic, Lucy is still an ambitious action film held together by a remarkable female driven role.
","Rife with analogies and open-ended questions, Lucy is a science fiction film that is every bit slick, stylized and surreal, and everything else you would expect from French action director Luc Besson. Like Besson's previous films, the extent of plausibility is directly proportional to the viewer's cerebral capacity, which, believe it or not, is what the narration is all about.Using one of the most debated questions of our time – the capacity of the human brain – Besson's script begins with the visible one-thirds of a hypothetical iceberg. Documentary-like intercuts stand in for creation and existence with an opening scene on cell multiplication. This is further explained by Professor Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman, no less) who in a conference in Paris, goes on to illustrate the cosmic relationship between death and immortality and how this relates to using 100 percent of the human brain. Freeman's main purpose in this film is to sound calm and calculated like when he presents documentaries, and to make scientific mambos jumbo sound profound, like he does in other films; using that voice, his second purpose is to bust the myth that humans only use 10 percent of their brain. Thousands of miles away, Norman's illustration becomes a metaphysical reality when Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), an American student in Taiwan, is tricked into working for a Korean drug lord. While another cutaway shows a deer stalked by cheetahs, it suffices to say that Lucy is naïve but not dumb because her focus soon turns to Darwinian survival. This is where Besson amps up the action when Lucy is ingested with an experimental drug called CPH4, a synthetic version of a metabolic enzyme secreted during pregnancy. As a primary effect, Lucy experiences a surge in cerebral capacity. Now at 20 percent, she is literally bouncing off the walls.Before Lucy exacts her revenge, ala dual wielding guns blazing, her transformation is shown at 10 percent intervals. This is fascinating mainly due to Johansson's performance at each interval and her character's evolution into a different being. Without giving away the best parts, all I'll say is at 30 percent Johansson's Lucy is a notch above her Black Widow in the Marvel film franchise, and way ahead of Dr. Manhattan's DC comic book world by the time she hits 70 percent. Then it gets all weird to the point where you question Besson's cerebral capacity while writing the script. With an obvious inspiration from a ton of similarly themed films, it's safe to say that the main plot arcs are borrowed from The Matrix, Transcendence and especially Limitless. Although Besson won't find much praise for originality, you could say his creation of Lucy is as much a new cinematic super hero as his Frankenstein-ish approach in creating her piece by piece. Having said that, it is imperative that the audience appreciates her flaws more than her abilities because it's more about what she is becoming rather than what she can do. Through this creation, Besson's vision is clear but it is still not an excuse for his laughable hypothesis followed by a questionable ending.Besides the unnecessary cramming of anthropology, paleontology, neuroscience and the mind boggling space-time continuum, Besson's forte is in the action set pieces and it shows. From locales in Taiwan to white-knuckle car chases in Paris, to a hypothetical encounter with our ancestral primate, the action is heavy handed even with subtle injections of humour. This might all seem traditional for Luc Besson, given his pedigree for femme fatal films like Nikita and The Fifth Element, amongst other classics. With Lucy, Besson's nonsense and lapse in logic is bearable, and at times enjoyable, thanks to the film's only saving grace and that is Johansson. Fresh off the critical success of 2013's Her and Under the Skin, both science fiction dramas, Johansson could be the new name in female driven plots, even if that means running the gauntlet with the likes of Jennifer Lawrence. But as far as myth busting goes, there's more to Johansson than meets the eye. Blond or not.",6,0,5,6 August 2014
RED," Old is Gold!
","Bruce Willis plays a retired CIA agent living off government pension. As Frank Moses, the highlight of his lonely suburban life is when conversing with Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker), a customer service agent handling Frank's pension. By deliberately destroying his pension checks, Frank often uses this as an excuse to call Sarah, thus building on a platonic relationship. A nice little off-beat romantic comedy, right? Wrong! Common now, 'Yippee-ka-yay' and all that jazz, this is Bruce Willis we are taking about. So anyway, one quiet evening, just before Frank retires for the night, a hit squad storms through his house but is unable to take him down. As it seems, Frank is Retired, but Extremely Dangerous (RED). Knowing that the hit squad must have watched his every move while tapping his phone calls, Frank heads towards Kansas City before his assailants can bait him with Sarah. Frank then re-assembles his former Black-ops team with the terminally ill Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), the paranoid Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) and former MI6 operative Victoria (Helen Mirren). Together, they learn that they are on a hit list having been involved in a secret mission in Guatemala dating back to 1981. With a CIA crack team led by William Cooper (Karl Urban) hot on their heels, Frank and his old buddies must now hold it together before facing an explosive showdown that involves the Vice-President himself.For what its worth, this is a film that doesn't try to be more than what it sets out to be– an entertaining action comedy. Speaking of action, what can you expect from old timers playing over the hill retired government spooks, right? Wrong Again! At 56, and as the tagline says, Willis still has it. So does 74 year old Freeman along with the Academy Award winning Helen Mirren. For the most part, action scenes are over the top, and in true Hollywood splendor, some scenes are almost ridiculous. Steeping out of a moving vehicle, lining up a shot and then emptying a clip before the vehicle stops spinning is as believable as a snow storm in the amazon. Then again, this is an action comedy after all. Sure enough, Malkovich steals the show while offering some hilarious moments through the film as a paranoid conspiracy theorist. As Marvin, he is insanely funny and brings his unique sarcasm in the form of funny one-liners. Adding on is Freeman with his usual wit and can literally slap you into laughter. Mary-Louise Parker is the unwitting victim in all this and humorously portrays the example of how cautious someone should be when wishing for something. Karl Urban on the other hand, is great as the determined CIA agent, but finds it hard to contain his native Kiwi accent towards the end. Then of course is the lovely and charming Mirren. She is an epitome of grace and screen charisma, even if her character wields the biggest guns in the film.German director Robert Schwentke knows how to make an entertaining film. Known for his 2005 thriller 'Flightplan', Schwentke goes all out with Red and fires from all cylinders. Brothers Jon and Erich Hoeber's script is justified by this director while adding his own finesse to their work. At the end of it all is a cloak and dagger and bullets blazing caper that pits together the CIA, KGB, MI6, and the Presidential Secret Service in one entertaining yet explosive farce.",Null,1,1,14 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Saving the best for the last...
","In all honesty, I have never been a fan of J. K. Rowling or her screen adaptation through Warner Bros. However, I have to admit that the last 10 years have been phenomenal for Rowling in not just establishing a fan base, or a cult following, or even a massive bank account, but in creating a whole new world; The world of Harry Potter and his adventures. What started as a lighthearted venture into the world of myth and magic ten years ago, culminates into a dark and powerful showdown between the forces of good and evil. Both parts are well interlinked, but the plot seems stretched at times. This is obviously due to the cinematic rendition of Rowling's books. The highlights are easily notable from both parts:Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 Minister Rufus predicts that the Ministry of Magic strengthens with Lord Volemort's rise in power.  Along with Severus Snape, Voldemort plans Harry Potter's assassination.  Harry, Hermione and Ron discover an evil locket with powerful negative energy.  They also discover the origins of the Sword of Gryffindor, which can destroy such lockets.  They then discover the origins of the Deathly Hallows, comprising of the legendary and omnipotent Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility.  Harry, with the help of his friends, recovers the Sword of Gryffindor and with its power, destroys the locket.  The ending scene has Voldemort breaking into Dumbledore's tomb to steal the Elder Wand.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 Griphook the goblin helps Harry, Hermione and Ron break into Bellatrix's vault in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor.  The trio return to Hogwarts where Severus Snape, now the Headmaster, threatens anyone who helps Harry and his friends.  Ron and Hermione declare their love for each other after destroying a Horcrux cup they stole from Bellatrix's vault.  Hogwarts is under attack by all Voldemort's all powerful forces.  Voldemort kills a key character and invokes the full potential of the Elder Wand.  Harry learns that Snape and his mother were good friends before she was killed, and that part of Voldemort's dark soul grows in his.  Harry prepares to die at the hands of Voldmort, resulting in a catastrophic battle between the two archenemies. Prior to the 5th installment, 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix', David Yates was virtually an unknown in cinema. With a history in TV productions, David Yates has etched his name in history for not just directing the last four installments, but for epically ending a multi-billion Dollar franchise with such magnitude, that only any idiot would think of re-booting the phenomenon known as 'Harry Potter'. Besides, he has severely raised the bar in any and all competing movies in this genre, giving 'The Lord of the Rings' Trilogy and its makers a run for their money. One week after this release and international critics are echoing words like, 'spectacular' and 'spell-binding'. As a movie buff, I can say this is cinema in its best form ever. Having not read any of Rowling's books, I have no idea about the book to cinema adaptation factor. However, the movie experience is too good to be true. There are a lot of things happening at any given time. Sometimes, keeping track of what's happening can be an engaging task, but in a good way. Although acting is flawless from the three protagonists (why shouldn't it, given they have been preparing for this for the last 10 years), it is Ralph Fiennes and Alan Rickman who stands out as the antagonists. Simply brilliant! Then there is a tidal wave of A-list talent from the crème de la crème of British cinema. Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson and it goes on and on, like the final quatrain in an epic opera. Although the longest running cinema franchise will be tied between Star Wars and the James Bond movies, the problem here is every now and again, we are introduced to different producers, directors and of course, protagonists. For that matter, over 6 actors have taken on the 007 call sign. For the Harry Potter saga, the entire Potter universe, if I may say so, is built round the lives of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. Earmarking these roles in cinematic history, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, will always be remembered for their roles in the Harry Potter franchise, no matter who or what they maybe 20 years from now. Where Yates succeeds is in giving this franchise a well deserved send-off by saving the best for the last. In doing so, he has vindicated the use of some eye-popping visual effects, renders the plot with the darkest atmosphere in the series, throws in a plethora of top actors and propels the pacing at a breathless rate. What he could have done without is the post-conversion to 3D. I really don't think 3D adds to this film's already immense scope. To me, this is taking advantage of crazed fans by squeezing the last penny out of pockets. And why not, being the last episode, the intention appears to stem from the greed of milking the cash cow dry. Put 2011's two summer heavyweights in a ring and there won't be a question about going the distance. 'Deathly Hallows Part 2' has 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' up against the ropes even before the first round begins!",Null,1,2,20 July 2011
Looper," Even with its centrally themed time paradox, Looper is an original and enjoyable science fiction film that relies on logic to dictate the narrative.
","If you thought Inception went overboard (pun unintended) with the whole dream within a dream within a dream, don't read any further. But like Inception and Memento before it, Looper is an intricately woven yarn that is very much a thinking man's movie; at least for the most part. Luckily, unlike the aforementioned films, writer-director Rian Johnson doesn't let it get to a point where we smell our own cerebral cortex cooking. Just when you raise a hand to scratch your head, the other hand snaps a finger in triumphant euphoria, as if solving a puzzle only moments before abandoning it.The setup has Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Joe, a mafia assassin in the year 2044. His narration tells us that although time travel is yet to be invented, it exists thirty years in the future. However, its use is condemned by the government but adopted by criminal organizations as a means of 'closing the loop'. This means ending an employee's tenure by sending him to the present, where a younger 'Looper' waits in an abandoned field with just a loaded shotgun. Loopers are paid handsomely, typically silver bars for each kill. When a Looper receives gold bars it is a cause for immediate celebration, but also means they have thirty years to live as they have just killed their future self thus closing the loop in the future. On one such contract, Joe is faced with killing his future self (Bruce Willis) but hesitates to pull the trigger. This much is known from pre-release trailers. What follows is a diabolical fight for survival where both Joes, though each unrelenting, must find and eliminate 'The Rainmaker', a person destined to become an ironfisted criminal mastermind responsible for closing all the loops.This is a science-fiction movie that relies heavily on logic, but not necessarily the kind found in The Matrix. It's as simple as basic computer programming, where the outcome of an action depends on a pre-determined set of rules. IF you do this, THEN that will happen; as a paradox, the premise in this film is very similar to the 'Butterfly Effect'— a metaphysical theory where cause and effect play a fundamental role in a nonlinear state of progression. Simply put, Johnson's forte is in telling a story where the end justifies the means. Given the centrally themed time paradox, it becomes all the more profound that however obscure the future may seem, it is the present that determines the outcome of that future. This grain of thought powers the final act where both Joes, each with opposing agendas, work towards preventing a cataclysmic chain of events. As such, a vital plot development is omitted from the trailers, owing to which, some viewers may find that the film begins and ends without cohesion. Without spoiling much I can say that a sub-plot involving genetic mutation takes center stage towards the end.Although I have referred to other movies of similar ilk, I am happy to report that Looper is conceptually original — all the more so when every other recent movie is a sequel or a remake or a remake of a remake. Add to this a solid performance from Gordon-Levitt who has appeared in more interesting films this year than Tom Cruise. As a younger Bruce Willis, it might take a while to get used to his facial prosthetics, but I am willing to wager that Gordon-Levitt watched quite a few of the former's movies to get the swagger right, complete with Willis' iconic smirk and grunt. Willis himself is back in form with a much needed departure from some half-made films he has chosen to merely appear in over the last couple of years. Together they form a great team and amusingly play the same person. A special mention goes to Emily Blunt, who although has more screen time than necessary, makes a refreshing change as a straight-talking, shotgun-wielding Southerner with very little trace of her native British accent. Her character brings in a questionable romantic element, but is also linked to a vital plot development. Finally, kudos to Johnson for a good attempt at skillfully presenting a sci-fi film that also has a film noir look and feel despite its futuristic setting. There are moments when you wish Johnson's script could have used Christopher Nolan's finesse, but that would be asking for too much. À la dual-wielding guns ablaze, Bruce Willis also gets his clichéd moments, but let's just say we would rather see Willis with a gun than a magic wand.This is a recommended movie. You can either watch it now or risk watching it later — by this I mean your future self could be annoyed with your present self for not watching it sooner.",7,1,3,30 May 2014
Joy," As an inspirational true story, Joy works almost entirely because of the absolute and commanding delivery from Jennifer Lawrence.
","To a certain extent, Joy can be construed as a follow up to 2012's Best Picture nominee, Silver Linings Playbook. That's because almost everyone from the latter film is back, including director David O. Russell. Does it work as a worthy follow up? Yes and no. And at the risk of sounding sexist (albeit unintentionally), I might even add that Joy is best appreciated by the fairer sex. But that doesn't necessarily mean the male audience is in for a snooze fest either.Evident right from the monochromatic prologue, Russell's narrative is a reverence for head-strong women with the heart to match. It's a pitch Russell has been honing for some time now, and after last year's American Hustle (also nominated for Best Picture), this would be his third consecutive film featuring the highly gifted Jennifer Lawrence. In a befitting parallel, Lawrence plays the titular Joy Mangano, a Long-Island based single mother who invented the Miracle Mop in the 1990s. Russell's story is narrated by Joy's grandmother Mimi (Diane Ladd), the only person who believes that her granddaughter is special. A divorcÃ©e herself, Joy has to deal with bickering from her divorced parents (Robert De Niro and Virginia Madsen), raising her kids in a rickety house, and her Tom Jones wannabe ex-husband (Ã‰dgar RamÃ­rez) living in the basement. Russell's nuance for dysfunctional family farce forms a bulk of the narrative before Joy comes up with the idea of a self-wringing mop. Designing and inventing the mop was the easy part. Selling it to the American public turns out to be a nightmare, made worse by betrayal and jealously from her family.That Joy went on to become a wealthy entrepreneur with over 100 patented products is barely touched upon. Instead, Russell's main focus is on Joy's struggles, and then a tonal shift through her determination to overcome a series of obstacles. Quite literally, Joy is initially on her hands and knees, mopping up after her deranged family, before a faceoff in Texas turns her into an overnight success story. In retrospect this might seem predictable, but the film's appeal is in its rags to riches underdog factor. It's a modern day Cinderella story without the need of a prince, and therein lies Russell's pro feminist plot device. As such, there isn't a male lead and the film is almost entirely anchored by Lawrence with gravitas much beyond her age. Reminiscent of her commanding tenacity in Winter's Bone, Lawrence is not only worthy of another Oscar nomination, her delivery here suggests that she could be in for the long-haul as a true blue Hollywood sweetheart. Meanwhile, De Niro is at his sarcastic best opposite Isabella Rossellini as Rudy and Trudy, hopeless romantics with a bizarre twist. Also returning is Bradley Cooper but late in the film. Although his character plays an important role, Cooper's inclusion is more of a submissive nod to previous collaborations with the director.In a year that produced quite a few films based on true stories, Joy works as an inspirational biopic owing to Russell's aptitude for minefield dramedies. Once again, characters punctuate the story with screwball mayhem but unlike Silver Linings Playbook, spontaneous hilarity is quickly replaced by an emotional backdrop that peaks towards the end. Like Erin Brockovich before, the heart of the film is highly inspiring in saying that if one woman could, any woman can. With or without a man.",6,3,8,7 January 2016
Moon," Original, scary and claustrophobic.
","What are the chances of making a sci-fi film with a low budget, with virtually non existent CGI, with just one actor playing out most of the plot? Furthermore, what are the chances of that film doing exceptionally well at the Sundance Film Festival after having been filmed by a rookie director? Co-written by Duncan Jones in his directional debut, this is one such film that goes on to prove that expensive budgets and mind numbing effects are not always a sure fire guarantee in the sci-fi genre. What works for Jones is the simplest yet best formula there is in cinema story telling, which in this case happens to be a well written script matched only by the actor it is written for. And that actor is Sam Rockwell, perfectly cast as the only human on the surface of the moon. Due to the current energy crisis on planet Earth, Sam Bell is an implant on the moon with the sole purpose of mining lunar soil for harvesting helium-3, a clean energy source he sends back to Earth. Assisting him in this solitary project is an artificial intelligence controlled robot called GERTY aptly voiced by Kevin Spacey. GERTY is also Sam's only companion, programmed to monitor his tasks while vigilantly watching over his health and daily supplies. Nearing the end of a three year contract, Sam is eagerly anticipating his return to Earth, more to reunite with his wife who was heavily pregnant on his departure, than to get away from this isolated existence. But due to a communications satellite failure, live video conferencing between home and the moon are limited to recorded messages sent both ways, but only occasionally. Now with just two weeks left for his return, GERTY does not recommend fixing the satellite relay, but maintains priority in extracting energy. It is at this point when Sam's health starts to fail with unexplained hallucinations. On a routine mining trip, he sees a young girl in his direction and crashes the rover in distraction. Awakening in the infirmary, Sam overhears a live communication feed between GERTY and headquarters on Earth, arousing his suspicion that all is not as it seems. Worse, Sam arrives at a startling conclusion that he may have never been alone all along. For a sci-fi thriller that lacks any of the grand splendors we have grown to expect from the likes of 'Star-Trek' and 'Star Wars', Jones adopts a technique most active directors would easily avoid only for its retro feel. Although 2009 has left its mark as the year of the sequels (was it Star Trek 6?), Jones has the definitive edge in terms of originality of content and fluidity of context. Having said that, Stanley Kubrick fans are in for a nostalgic trip down memory lane with certain similarities to '2001: A Space Odyssey'. GERTY, eerily voiced by Kevin Spacey more than pays homage to HAL 9000. Then there is the disorientation and hallucination associated with solitude as last seen in Steven Soderbergh's 'Solaris'. But Jones isn't done yet, in fact by the time we start to unravel his diabolical twist towards the end, he has only just begun to narrate how unique we as humans really are. And by the time he's done, there awaits a shocking lesson in corporate ethics versus human identity; homework if you will, for us to mull over long after the credits go up. This again, is masterfully penned into Nathan Parker's screenplay, adapting from Jones' original story. Two other aspects seamlessly blending in are Clint Mansell's score and Gary Shaw's believable cinematography. Remember, CGI is at a bare minimum, yet that sinister feeling of being the only person living on the moon is well rendered. Ironically, sometimes you even feel Sam's claustrophobia when there is everywhere to run, but no where to hide. And this is when Mansell's score heightens that alarming sensation.For a film that starts slow, it sure packs a stinger of a blind-sided punch in the end, one that will have viewers reeling in thought and drooling for more. Good thing then, that Jones is already planning a prequel and a sequel, thus broadening this narrative into his own sci-fi trilogy. If he stays on course as he does here, I'm betting hands down that the sci-fi genre is about to witness another colossal battle; Duncan Jones as David versus J. J. Abrams as Goliath.",8,4,9,1 November 2012
Hacksaw Ridge," Hacksaw Ridge is brutal yet one of the best war films in a long time.
","It's been ten years since Mel Gibson made those alleged anti-Semitic remarks. That's about the same time Gibson has been looking for work as a director in Hollywood. But hypothetically speaking, if Gibson were to throw down the gauntlet against the likes of Spielberg, this is how one would imagine him doing it.Hacksaw Ridge is not only Gibson's best film since Braveheart, it is also the best war film since Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. As an actor and a director, Gibson's symbiosis with cinema has almost always been about self-sacrifice and patriotism. In that tradition, Hacksaw Ridge is one of the most moving films on heroism and the second reason why this film is a must-see. Despite countless films on World War II, this is an original yet true story that has never been told before. Comprising of an ensemble cast, the film opens over the vistas of Blue Ridge Mountains, Virginia, where we are first introduced to Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) and the estranged relationship with his alcoholic and WWI veteran father Tom (Hugo Weaving). It's a pivotal part of the story that would ultimately determine the decisions Doss would make after enlisting in the war. This is also where Doss falls head over heels for local nurse Dorothy (Teresa Palmer) and promises to marry her as soon as he returns. All this feels a little clichéd, and given the setting, a bit like the love story in Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. The next part is the boot camp segment and essentially where the narrative kicks in some humour, ala R. Lee Ermy styled commanding officer played by Vince Vaughn. Doss is immediately branded a coward for refusing to touch a rifle. Not even platoon Captain Glover's (Sam Worthington) discriminatory threats will smudge Doss' belief in never taking a life. This only means that Doss must work harder and disprove his CO's ranting that 'a unit is only as strong as its weakest member'. As an unlikely soldier, what Doss manages to do during the rest of the film is absolutely incredible but not before Gibson is let loose with a ravenous appetite for violence. We've seen what Gibson did to the character of Jesus in The Passion of the Christ, and going by that reputation, this should come as a fair warning for the queasy that there is no shortage of gore, guts, and severed limbs in this film. In taking the fight to blood soaked trenches in Okinawa, it suddenly dawns on the audience how and why the word 'Hacksaw' was coined in Japanese territory. Even so, carnage although graphic is somehow poetic and a first for Gibson. That's largely due to the seasoned cast and the attention given when they are introduced, resulting in ample reason to root for them. Led by the charismatic Garfield, each character is sympathetic, brave and sometimes even funny which gives Gibson's broad strokes an emotional undertone when we see them getting picked off before knowing what hit them. Many will tout this film as Mel Gibson's comeback vehicle. While this may be partly true, the film in its entirety is a well-crafted ode to selfless courage infused with reverence for divinity. For what has mostly been a bad year in cinema, 2016 seems to be sprouting, albeit late in the year but closer to Oscar season, with films devoted to real life heroes. Sully was one of them. If Desmond Doss was eventually venerated with the Congressional medal of Honour and all without firing a single bullet, Hacksaw Ridge could prove to be Gibson's atonement in as much as his return to form.",8,6,11,14 November 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Looks don't mean a damn thing
","At the time of writing this review, I am under the impression that the North American continent is still reeling from the aftershocks of a Global financial recession. But if the producers have $195 million Dollars to burn, literally, then at a time like this, it is evident that people with money are not prudent enough to avert another financial melt down. Sure, this movie will surpass its budget from just the opening box-office revenue. My big question is whether this Film has enough acclaim to propel the franchise forward? With due respect to the producers, director, actors, and fans of the series, I seriously doubt there will be a fourth compartment to this franchise. If ever there is one, it would be as lucrative as whipping a dead horse. Don't get me wrong. Michael Bay is a fine director with some excellent films in repute. Although Bay has produced (some with Jerry Bruckheimer) over 20 mega titles, as a director, he will always be remembered for 'Bad Boys', 'Armageddon' and 'Pearl Harbor'. Even so, Bay has never been considered for an Academy Award nomination. On the contrary, he has earned Razzie Awards for Worst Director for 'Armageddon' and 'Pearl Harbor'. Although personally, I enjoyed both those movies. But if I were to guess, as a kid he must have been obsessed with firecrackers. This third outing has the Michael Bay signature scribbled all over it. Explosions, special effects, explosions, CGI, the other side of the moon, an underwear model that replaces another model who refused to show off her underwear, and some more explosions. Yes, the script tries to be better than the second installment titled 'Revenge of the Fallen', and tries really hard to give depth to the characters. The tactic used this time is developing deeper emotions in the human characters while rendering a darker plot. There are some other bits and pieces which I will get to later, but that's about it. Did I mention there are explosions in this film? If you have missed the first two titles, no big deal. There is no plot continuation whatsoever so there is no need to watch the previous two titles. Actually, I would recommend not watching the second installment. The first and biggest plot hole sees Sam Witwicky as a college graduate, but without a job. Apparently, after helping the Autobots save the world twice, and receiving the congressional Medal of Honor from President Barak Obama, Sam is still not worthy of a job. Go figure. Meanwhile, the Autobots continue to work with the US government in tracking down Decepticon stragglers until an alien fuel cell is found at an abandoned radioactive site in Chernobyl. On investigation, the fuel cell emerges as a classified object retrieved during the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969. Arriving on the Moon in search of the Fuel Cell's source, Optimus Prime finds a downed spacecraft that was also classified by the US government. Inside, lies a dying former leader of the Auotbots, Sentinel Prime, and beside him, five strange pillars. What follows is over two hours of special effects that will engage your optic and acoustic nerves to the max. Then again, what more can you expect when the main producer is Steven Spielberg himself.You have action, you have fast paced action and you have mindless action. Guess which category this film falls into? At times, even the last category goes over the top. As I mentioned before, the film attempts at showing its never-before-seen sensitive side. But seriously, who are you kidding? This film and its predecessors were always meant to be a testosterone fuelled adventure. The acting is horrible and in now way conveys what the half-baked script tries too. I was under the impression that Shia LaBeouf is an up and coming actor. Sadly, this has to be his worst movie as an actor or his best movie as a bad actor. Introducing Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in her first ever acting role (let alone first ever major film production) may be controversial in itself for replacing Megan Fox, but she is proof that you can never expect serious acting from cat-walk sirens. Is she better than Megan Fox? Stunningly better looks, extremely two dimensional acting. While Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson do not add anything fresh in their third appearance, adding John Malkovich and Kevin Dunn along with John Turturro does slow down the pace to some well received lighter moments. There are also well placed cameos from Francis McDormand, Patrick Dempsey and Buzz Aldrin. I thought this was a clever venture to have Aldrin pegged to the film's version of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. Blending a Film's fictitious plot with historical events is always considered a scriptwriter's gift for thinking outside the box. However, the rest of Ehren Kruger's screenplay takes a massive beating with more holes in the plot than craters on the moon. Pun unintended.This third installment will entertain you if you have nothing else to watch. Teenagers may lap up all two and a half hours of it, but will forget about it even as the end credits roll up. If Michael Bay AND Shia LaBeouf can salvage some critical acclaim after the box-office buzz settles, it would be an ideal time to quit. Another installment in this series with either or both of them will be a final nail to the coffin.",5,3,8,8 July 2011
Sully," Sully is one of the Years' best from a legendary director at his no-nonsense best.
","Many people think of Clint Eastwood as a legend. Myself included. At an age when most Hollywood personalities are turning senile, Eastwood is still churning out auteur stuff. At its heart, Sully is a modest celebration of an All American hero, much like Eastwood's previous film American Sniper. Modest and celebration go hand-in-hand, like an oxymoron, because in reality, the message in this film is much larger than it appears on screen.Consider the fact that Captain Sullenberger (again, Hanks at his brilliant yet modest best) had decades of experience as a pilot before the incident. Not a blemish in his career having flown over a million passengers safely in 42 years as a commercial pilot. That's an extraordinary feat for anyone in the aviation industry. But all that was almost instantly tarnished when bigwigs from the NTSB took over the investigation. They wanted to blame someone. Somehow his years of devotion to the job didn't matter. In their books Sullenberger didn't follow procedure. Herein lies the crux of the film based on the real incident that occurred on 15 Jan 2009 - instinct versus experience versus procedure. Could Sullenberger have saved the lives of all 155 souls on board that day had he followed procedure? The answer to that question is almost terrifying, not only in the film, but also to anyone confined to the nitty-gritties of hardcore airport and flight ops. And that's probably why the incident has been dubbed the 'Miracle on the Hudson'.There's a lot of liberty compressing months of investigation into a short 95 minutes of screen time. But that also means there's not a single minute wasted in telling this remarkable story. Apart from a couple of stock scenes showing panic stricken passengers, Sully is as remarkable as the story it depicts. This is not only Eastwood at his no-nonsense best, it's a steadfast salute to professionalism, both on screen and in reality. It's a director's film through and through so I won't be surprised if Sully gets a nod for a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars. And then some.",9,0,2,26 September 2016
