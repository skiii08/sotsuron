Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's Star Wars, of course it's great!
","First of all, to everyone who has seen poor reviews of this movie, don't believe it.  Go see it for yourself.  I am a huge fan of the original trilogy, and I believe that the Phantom Menace lives up to the standard set by the first three.  While it is somewhat different,  it is still very familiar.  I enjoyed this movie very much, and was enthralled by it from beginning to end.  I am not going to go into the plot at all, but let me just say that I have already seen it four times, and plan to go again this weekend.  The story was great, the action sequences were amazing, and the lightsaber duel was the most incredible thing I have ever seen.  I think Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were amazing as Jedi Knights.  I cannot wait for Episode 2, to see where Mr. Lucas takes this story from here.  This one definitely lives up to the hype.",10,0,0,26 May 1999
