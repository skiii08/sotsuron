3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Disneyland
","Up until a specific turning point I really, really enjoyed this movie. A poor and crippled farmer who is trying to raise money to his farm and at the same time wanting to restore some self-respect decides to escort a criminal to a train in a small town with a small group of men. It's a long way to the train and on the way the farmer and the criminal develop some sympathy towards each other. It is something that the criminal is in denial of which is made explicit in a scene where he is confronted by the farmer's son who believes that he has seen some acts of the prisoner that shows that he is also a 'good' person. This he denies. The sympathy that develops between the two has been seen before, I personally came to think of 'the contract' in where Cusack takes his son on a trekking trip and during this they find an escaped convict (Morgan Freeman) which he decides to deliver to the police and thereby regaining the respect from his son. The challenge is to understand why that sympathy develops. As I see it the farmer is somewhat bitter because his life hasn't turned out well despite the fact that he is honest. Therefore I think that he secretly admires Ben Wade who totally disregards society and maybe he doesn't find it difficult to identify with him - he has the same urge himself and maybe he has even played with the thought of becoming an outlaw. On the other hand you have the prisoner who meets the farmer's family and very quickly understands his situation. The knowledge that he gets from the visit is at first used in a scene where he tries to bribe him but later on I think that he both respects him for his courage and - as the rest of us -understands the necessity behind his choice to escort him to the train.So far so very, very good. But the before mentioned turning point is so radical that I found it impossible to believe and therefore my summarization is '3:10 to Disneyland' because it becomes way to sentimental and pathetic. The turning point I am referring to is the scene where Ben Wade decides that he no longer will fight the farmer but instead actively help getting on the train in order for him to win the respect of his son who is watching. When you think about it its actually quite sad that the farmer has to risk his own life to get some respect. That Ben Wade now has had some 'corrective emotional' experience that has made him one of the good guys to the point where he is willing to get hanged is beyond my wildest comprehension.And that he finally decides to gun down his own gang - although they are lawless - is again way to difficult for me to comprehend.To summarize I must still say that I was very much entertained and that I really enjoyed the movie - especially the dialogue which I think there was put a lot of effort into. I will recommend it and although you end up agreeing with some of my thoughts it doesn't necessarily make the movie a lousy one.Regards Simonps. Very nice seeing Peter Fonda again.PPs.

Underworld," Worst cinematic experience in a very long time.
","I really think that this movie was made for young, self-centered people with no knowledge of the vampire lore. It made me furious to watch Selene as I saw her as a very narcissistic person who constantly was too aware of her own appearance. It made me feel like I was watching somebody up on the catwalk each time I saw her. The way she jumped, walked, shot with her guns and the way she looked from under her hair. I was so annoyed. Completely without any kind of character. It has been stated that she falls in love with Michael Corvin but that is something we have to deduce from the fact that she kisses him. I didn't see any affection, tenderness or soft spoken words between them. She is just too hollow.So much from the vampire lore was omitted that it felt really weird. What had become of their demonic nature, why didn't they drink blood and, as others have pointed out, how come that they cast a shadow? As we learn, they are still vulnerable to sun-light, but there isn't any during the whole film.Were we supposed to feel any sympathy for either side in the conflict? I didn't at all and basically I think that if you do not engage yourself in the protagonist then the movie has failed seriously. The only thing I was hoping for was, that everybody ended up killing each other.I don't think that I will spoil anything by saying, that there will be a show-down in the end. Let me just say that they should really, really have used a stand-in/stunt-man for poor old Viktor. So in order to make this film a good experience you really have to stop thinking and just drift with it - and this was simply impossible for me.regards SimonPs.

12 Angry Men," true administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good
","Overall I loved this movie. It shows the group-dynamics of 12 people, the jury, trying to decide if there is 'reasonable doubt' concerning whether a young boy killed his father. The discussions are tense and little by little we learn from these what supposedly happened on that night the kids father died. We are therefore also drawn into the question of whether the boy did it or not ourselves and what at first seems like a clear cut case along the way becomes all of a sudden much more complicated. It is a film that dares to handle nuances and ambiguities (we are never certain of whether the boy did it or not) in a way we rarely see. Its also a movie that lets us watch these 12 angry men discuss in the same room for a full 96 minutes without it ever getting boring, which I have to respect; you really have to thrust your material to let a whole movie consist of a discussion.The movie also tries to show how personal issues can cloud the judgments of the jurors. I am thinking about one specific juror, and although the idea, of showing us how his own personal story interferes with sound judgment, is splendid, I frankly didn't like the way it unfolded in the movie. That's why I only give this movie 8/10.If this movie in any way is supposed to represent how the legal system work I pray to god that I will never be put in a situation where a jury have to decide my guilt in any matter.Regards SimonPs.

Pan's Labyrinth," Faun and Fascism.
","This was a movie that I felt connected to, mostly on an intellectual level. And although I also can applaud it for it's acting I must confess that I wasn't entertained. I can see that other who has given a review on this movie has claimed that the gore is very explicit but also very necessary. I just cannot agree on this. That Captain Vidal is evil itself could have been shown in much more subtle ways - and when this is done it is often much more terrifying as it makes your imagination picture what is not shown and the result is, that you picture what you yourself think is the ultimate evil.I have heard off and actually met people who, when they were children made up a fantasy world or a fantasy friend. The reason for this can be many. It can be a matter of needing someone to confide in, or a matter of feeling lonely. In the case of Ofelia I understood her imaginary world as a result of escapism. She has a very lyrical and poetic mind and desperately needs to avoid or deny reality as it is both very hostile and out of her control and this together makes her create a world that she can interact with and through the tests that she is given she is also able to control it. An example of this is that she is all of a sudden able to do something about her mother's very problematic pregnancy.Because I wasn't entertained this doesn't mean that this picture isn't great or isn't worth seeing; the theme is important and the acting is splendid.Regards SimonPs.

Alien," When you are terrified and expendable.
","Sci-fi movies often deals with the theme of survival. Humans in a strange and hostile environment that they are trying to adapt to while they are facing some sort of predatorian enemy. The underlying fear that these stories work around is probably that if we one day will meet intelligent life in outer space what kind of encounter can we then expect? There are many ways to answer this question as we have seen in 'Close encounters of the third kind', 'Contact', 'Pitch Black', 'Stargate', 'Doom', '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Starship Troopers' to mention a few.In 'Alien' we follow the crew on board the cargo vessel 'Nostromo' as they are returning to Earth with ore. They pick up what at first seems to be an SOS from a planet that they pass. They send out a rescue team and from here on it's a matter of survival.Many elements come well together in this film; the characters are very well developed and the atmosphere of claustrophobia and desperation is being portrayed with great skill. As others have pointed out the score is truly unique.The scene where Dallas (Tom Skerrit) dies is in my opinion the one that frightens me the most. He gets into the air-shaft with a flame-thrower in order to chase the alien. The movement-sensors that they use to track the Alien malfunctions and his anxiety, in a very convincing way, slowly gets the best of him until the point where his brain is 'emotionel hijacked' and he makes a very irrational and fatal move. This scene alone makes the whole movie worth your while.I saw it again the other day and was a little disappointed in what I would call some minor flaws; That the alien is able to get into the ship is a very unlikely event as I see it. Even though the rescue mission passes quarantine after returning then it is still unbelievable that the crew doesn't detect the alien in Kanes stomach. And the death of Brett is, although the suspense builds up extremely well in this particular instance, still hard to accept as he does the worst thing imaginable; walks alone back to get the cat.Besides these minor flaws, that none the less irritated me as I would have liked the movie to be flawless, there is nothing I can put my finger on. One thing that makes this film stand out is the pace that it is told in. It is slower than expected but this doesn't make it a boring movie but instead it allows you both to engage yourself in the various details and last but not least it makes all the difference in building up the before mentioned atmosphere.I would most certainly recommended this movie if the genre in any way appeals to you.Regards SimonPs.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Melodrama in disguise makes the movie fall apart....
","From a very focused starting point, that seems almost poetic, namely three Billboards outside a small town with a simple question asked in an accusetory tone the movie gets desorientend and graps to sentimalism in order to create progression.Mildred is angry. Angry and bitter beyond point of no return. She insists upon, and thereby gambling everything in her life, to have those three billboards standing, accusing the local sheriff (Woody Harrelson) for not catching the person who raped, killed and burnt her daughter.We follow the reactions in the town as a result of this and at this point it seemed like an interesting premise to explore what conflicts and alliances this could bring about.Sad to say, but every single personality trait was stereotyped.... I will elaborate by pointing out how the movie seemed to try to force us to laugh of two insecure and retarded people making stupid comments as their most defining characteristic. Even Adam Sandler is more funny than this.Everybody shouts, curses, threats and beats the hell out of each other.And then, more or less as a consequence of the sheriffs suicide, everybody decides to become friends and although the movie plays on the socialdrama theme, the reconciliation is fairy tail like. For instance (spoiler) One of the retarded police officers has beaten the hell out of a guy and afterwards thrown him out of a first floor window. By accident they share a room in a hospital and this guy without any preliminary process of anger accepts the apology by leaving a glass of orange juice on the officers table. That scene in itself made me want to leave the cinema. My god!Definition of 'Melodrama': a sensational dramatic piece with exaggerated characters and exciting events intended to appeal to the emotions.Need I say more?Regards SimonPs.
I have only once left the cinema before time (Sean Connery in 'Medicine Man' 1992) but was very, very close at doing that again...PPs.

The Grapes of Wrath," Who do we point the rifle at?
","I got my orders, it ain't up to me, I didn't set the price, take it or leave it. We are confronted with an economic system that suppresses downwards; nobody is held responsible. It even seems that 'nobody' doesn't even exist.This is a story about how ordinary citizens, mainly farmers, gets affected by the big depression. We follow the Joad family who out of desperation tries to find a job in California. When they arrive at 'the promised land' they quickly find out that life is hard to maintain. The jobs are difficult to find and when they find one the wages are an insult. Throughout the movie there is a constant battle to sustain the basic needs such as food and shelter. Despite this fight and the competition for the jobs the workers shows solidarity with each other but cannot use this to get proper organized even though a few tries (the story could be seen as a predecessor to 'In Dubious battle' where the struggle to get the workers organized continuous).The Joad family are very poor given the circumstances but nonetheless they are looked down upon and stigmatized; being poor equals being subhuman; An Okie. If they ask questions or making a statement in front of a policeman or guard they are threatened to loose their job or getting the label 'agitator'.Only in one place do they find themselves at home; in the government camp. It is a society in its own that is a safe heaven. It is built on democratic principles and is looked upon as a threat by the big corporations who actively tries to destroy such. Democracy with it laws that regulates employer/employee relationship is a threat to maximum profit.The movie is shot in Black and white, the men are lean and the dialogue is very direct and without polite manners. You sense that the farmers doesn't talk this way because of hostility but simply because it is part of their cultural identity. The dialogue is in many cases taken right out of the book. That doesn't make it a lesser movie; it is hard if not to say impossible to compete with Steinbecks sharp pen. It may be a challenge to sense the affection in the Joad family but is there although it is not expressed overtly.In comparison the movie adaptation has a stronger focus than the more than 500 pages book had and therefore some of the characters didn't unfold enough to be understood properly. The ending is different but I think I understand the choice to let the movie finish off in a more bearable way.The part of the story where the Joads arrive at a farm full of guards, to harvest peaches scared the hell out of me in the book but not so much in the movie. It felt like the Joads where held in a combined prison/zoo and the choice they had to leave wasn't a real choice; it was a choice between annihilation or accept gruesome and absurd life conditions.The movie didn't dwell so much. It didn't stay so much with the important details that showed the reason to be desperate. How much can I get for a nickel? How much do I earn when I harvest a basket full of peaches? How much food can I buy for a day's work? Can I save money for the rainy days? Seems like boring details but to me these kind of never ceasing thoughts must have been a large part of being affected by the depression.Steinbeck writes the story with anger. You sense that he is furious; this is a piece of fiction that was needed, that had to come and thank goodness Steinbeck took it upon himself to put into words what was going on during the depression.The farmers are the 99% who tries to do what is expected of them. There is a growing sense of who the 1% are – and of course you can draw a parallel to the depression of today and the need to organize and criticize the financial system via the 'occupy wall street' movement.Regards Simon",9,1,2,31 January 2012
Ant-Man," Finds a splendid balance between humour and action....
","The reason I gave this movie a chance was simply that I was very curious as to how an action movie could be built around a superhero with a reference to ants. Ants? Not scary, not cool or tough or sinister or anything else than being annoying.Our Antman is the classic Antihero, that flunks in almost every detail of his life. Gets fired from an Ice Cream Store selling smoothies, having three not very bright 'Vombat' friends, living in a flat where the neighbors are having a 24/7 rave party and having this amazing ability as a thief of absolute no use as he is trying hard to rehabilitate himself.He is also a father and without going into much detail here I would just comment, that this part of the movie is its weakest. His daughter is 'ah so cute' and displays such deep affection towards him, although he has been in prison for quite a while (and probably having very little contact with her), that it seems fairy-tale like.As other have pointed out the super villain is partly a mystery as to the motives of jeopardize the future of the earth.... His brain has been grilled? He has a father complex? Money?Still the movie gets the job done by being entertaining and finding this well blended harmony between being ironic towards its own superhero and still making the action scenes being one big long thrilling roller-coaster ride.Regards SimonPs.

28 Weeks Later," dystopia with a happy end...?
","The plot evolves around a family of four; father, mother, daughter and son who desperately fight for survival in the post-infectious age.As you may know the infected on mainland Britain dies of starvation after a while and society is then being rebuilt with the help of forces from USA. Here you have the first really controversial moments in the movie as they (the American soldiers) are being portrayed as trigger-happy brutes with no respect of the potential danger that surrounds them. This is tiresome to watch and also a to often used cliché in other movies; the bragging soldier with his big gun who dies a violent and unexpected (to himself) death. I don't necessarily agree with other reviews that points out that this could be seen as a political comment on the behavior of US forces around the world.One of the things that I like the most about modern zombie-movies is the sense of dysphoria portrayed. The whole atmosphere should be permeated by terror and fear of total annihilation of the human race. One by one the protagonist should die, your friends and family should turn against you and survival should only be possible for a limited period; a modern dystopia.In my view zombie-movies should explore the human reactions to these kind of extreme life-conditions: Fear, survival-instinct, heroism, coward-ism, traumatization etc. There really shouldn't be a happy end nor shouldn't the protagonists destinies be decided upon some sort of higher justice (eg the coward dies the most brutal death and the hero gets away in the end) and there shouldn't be a big show-down in the end to settle the score. Realism should be favored instead. And I really think that the movie fails here on several accounts.I am not even sure that the word 'zombie' is being used in '28 weeks later' but never the less the resemblance to older zombie movies is strong. There is no more talk about superstitious explanations like 'no more room in hell' or voodooism but instead we deal with virus and genetics which only adds to the realism (I think that every age has it own fear-phenomena and that we in our time are really, really afraid of virus-attack). We don't have to shoot the infected in the head anymore to kill them which again in some way adds to the realism and thereby makes it easier for us to identify with the protagonist.28 weeks later works well on several levels given the genre its in but it still has some major flaws. In order for the story to develop the protagonist does some really stupid things which is very annoying to watch and which again makes it difficult to empathize with them. They take some big risks at certain points which they don't have to take. For me one of the important aspects of being a screen-writer is to make the persons portrayed believable which I don't think is entirely achieved in this movie.Another thing that was annoying was the lack of fear or alertness in some specific situations. I am thinking in particular of the scene where the children and some other survivors pause at some sort of fair-ground. They seem so relaxed and off guard like they were on some Sunday trip.All in all I would still recommend it to anyone who likes to be taken away into a dark and sinister world for 90 minutes.",7,1,2,18 September 2007
The Revenant," To endure, suffer and survive. Repeat.
","The movie got such a high acclaim when it came to Denmark and therefore it was with expectations high that I watched it the other night.The story itself is quite plain and linear without surprises. An escape that turns into a hunt for the man who has killed our hero's son. A hunt you know how will end the very second it starts. The score (spoiler) is to be settled and our hero is going to find full closure which will bring meaning to all the suffering that he is going through.The story takes place at the frontier with all the fascination this involves. It's the simple life without all the obligations of modern lifestyle and further a life where you can test yourself against the merciless and indifferent mother nature that is at play. For some, maybe the pioneers who lived and died here, shaped the national character of the American people and therefore this period is given a high amount of importance.All the suffering Leonardo endures on his high octane thirst for revenge is to repetitious and although the movie is beautifully made its not enough. The story itself is too straightforward.Regards SimonPs. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review.

Pitch Black," who can you trust when the killing starts?
","We follow a group of around nine people trying to survive on a hostile planet where they have crashed with their spaceship. Among them is a prisoner, played by Vin Diesel, who they fear and at the same time have to depend upon as the story develops and this makes the group-dynamic very interesting to follow. They have no chance but to trust him and still they become anxious every time he is out of sight. The fight for survival has been made with a lot of suspense and the little group faces a lot of challenges which they try to solve in the best possible way. On the planet they have crashed upon, they discover a former colony of humans that apparently was abandoned in a hurry so along with the fight for survival comes the effort to try and answer all the questions as to what happened here?I think that this movie is beyond any comparison much better than the sequel. If treated in a competent way the 'survival'-theme is always interesting to follow especially if it is combined with the possibilities and challenges of being in a group. Should I rely on the group or should I only trust myself? Should I try to become the leader or should I accept that somebody else is trying to impose leadership on the group? There are many nuances to describe in the theme of 'survivel with the group' and I think that 'Pitch Black' pulls this off in a both entertaining and plausible (if you accept the basic principles of the story) way.Regards SimonPs.

Apocalypse Now," Streetgang calling Almighty.
","This movie has given me one of the greatest movie experiences in my life. That is why I don't have a choice but to give it 10/10.I have seen this movie countless times (the original one), I have had Eleanor Coppola's: 'Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse' on VCR and seen that one more times than I can remember and I have read several reviews of the movie from Magazines etc.According to the legend it is based on Joseph Conrad's 'Hearts of Darkness' and several directors (Orson Welles for instance) have tried to put that book into a usable film-script but failed.So Francis Coppola tried, and told it as a story of a Captain Willard who, during the Vietnam war, gets the assignment to go up a river (into Cambodia ('that's classified')) to find Colonel Kurtz whose 'methods are unsound' and to 'exterminate him with extreme prejudice'.The opening scene is simply outstanding. We see Willard in a hotel room haunted by his demons, bursting into tears and smashing the mirror with his bare hands. The score is the Doors 'the End' - a superb choice. If you see Eleanor Coppola's movie you will realize that Martin Sheen is actually on the brink of a mental breakdown and that Coppola exploits it. The crew is afraid that he will actually attack Coppola but nonetheless Coppola keeps directing him, bringing out emotions of sorrow in him. So what you see in this opening scene is not so much acting as it is a man who is actually on the verge of a mental breakdown.Willard gets on a boat with a small group of soldiers and as they go up that river we slowly learn about Colonel Kurtz through the dossiers that Willard brings along as well as getting acquainted with the madness of war.What we learn about Kurtz is, that he has had an outstanding military career but that at a certain point he starts to use methods that cannot be tolerated by his superiors.After a long and dangerous journey we finally reach Kurtz's hide-out and are greeted by a very nervous guy (Dennis Hopper) with pseudo-philosophical thoughts and a local tribe. From him we learn the Kurtz is clear in his mind but sick in his soul and that he expects something from Willard - understanding? Later Kurtz returns and takes Willard as a prisoner and talks with him about war in some dialogs that sends shivers down your spine. Kurtz tells Willard about his war experiences and of one in particular that made him realize what it takes to win a war. What he tells is that he earlier in the Vietnam war went into a village where he together with other US soldiers inoculated the children of that village. After they leave the village they are suddenly called back and upon returning they see that the north Vietnamese have been there and hacked off every little inoculated arm. And as if 'shot by a diamond bullet in his forehead' Kurtz realizes that an act like this is what is needed to win the war. He goes on and claims that a soldier that can do an act like this is not a monster but just has an extraordinary amount of will; the will to win the war.After having this 'revelation' colonel Kurtz applies the same sort of methods himself and although they are very effective they cannot be tolerated by his superiors and this is why Willard gets the assignment to terminate him. Kurtz's way of viewing how a war should be fought poses some very interesting questions that are difficult to answer in a simple way. As I see it Kurtz's point is, that once you have decided to go to war it really doesn't make sense not to use any method available to win it. There can only be total war if you really want to win. The act of hacking off the arms of the children has been done in the attempt to win the war and should not to be seen as an act motivated by mere hatred. If you concern yourself with the civilians and human rights then you are a nothing but a hypocrite. Kurtz then becomes a very efficient soldier but his new war-philosophy makes it impossible for him to stay 'human' (or makes him sick in his soul as stated by Hopper).It has been stated that the ending is a flop. Coppola himself struggled hard to find a suitable ending and I am not sure that he was altogether satisfied with this one. To me I always understood it this way: Kurtz wants Willard to kill him as he has probably seen and imposed horrors beyond our wildest imaginations which makes it nearly impossible for him to carry on. When he at last is brought down by Willard the only thing that comes to his mind is 'the horror, the horror'. He is truly sick in his soul.I will recommend this to anyone as I think it tries to give us some account on what war can bring out in the soldiers who are sent away to fight.regards SimonPs.

Gone with the Wind," Gone with the Time.
","A good vine can age and thereby become even more superior but this surely isn't the case with 'Gone with the Wind'.The acting had a theatrical quality to it, the relationship between colored and white were embarrassing to watch, Ashley was totally miscast and the outdoor scenes felt very much like indoor studio.What was interesting to follow was the relationship between Scarlet and Rhett and specifically the way their gender roles were. Scarlet was deeply 'affected by poverty and the war' as stated by Rhett and she had therefore developed a personality that was like a patriarch. She was cold hearted, mostly occupied with surviving and getting Tara (the family farm) back on foot again. In a sense she is the impersonation of the saying 'The south will rise again'. She has a lot of strength and will but lacks the tender side which Rhett on the other hand has. He is a very caring father, has a lot of affection towards Scarlet and is being eaten up by jealousy since Scarlett is in love with Ashley. The depiction of their roles in the relationship were interesting to engage in but at the same time their attitudes towards each other fitted to much into a pattern of 'when Rhett approaches Scarlet he is turned down and vice versa'. This made it tedious to watch in the long run.Regards SimonPs. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review.

No Country for Old Men," ...But is it a country for anybody..?
","This movie really did a good job scaring me in a way I haven't been for a very long time. I had no idea how it was going to develop (which doesn't happen very often these days!) and several times during the movie I noticed I was holding my breath. On principle I don't give a movie top rating after the first review so I am going to give it 9/10 - and maybe I will change this when I have seen it again.It's a story we have seen so many times before; a guy stumbles over some drug money and decides to keep them - knowing that there is a big risk involved. Our 'lucky' guy is an Vietnam veteran(Llewelyn Moss) who, during a hunting trip, stumbles over a very obvious shoot-out scene. A lot of automatic weapons and a lot of dead bodies. Our guy figures that there must have been 'a last man standing' and uses his hunting skills to track him down. He is in the meantime dead but has the money that our guy probably knew he would have as he had seen the drugs lying on a truck. From here on the movie turns into a chase between Moss and an assassin/serial killer. I know that this probably doesn't sound altogether innovative but the script and direction makes the difference.Tommy Lee opens the movie with a narrative where he describes the changes in time seen from the law enforcers point of view. A couple of generations ago they didn't have to wear a gun but now.!There was something about our protagonists that made me shutter; the title is so true 'this is no country for old men'. Its only a country for the ruthless and cynical.I have rarely seen a better casting. Moss is so believable as the war veteran living in a camper. His opponent - Anton Chigurh - epitomizes evil. I came to think of 'the iceman' every time he appeared. So sinister and determined. One of the things that is so great is, that you don't know who will prevail. Chigurh is so lethal but on the other hand Moss knows how to handle himself very well. He is resourceful and have a background as a veteran and a hunter to make him a formidable opponent.This movie doesn't leave you very optimistic and with a faith in your fellow man but it tells you a thrilling story of two very determined men who wont yield. Go see this movie - also to support a production who dares to venture into new territory with the risks this implies. It would have been so much easier just to follow the sort of premade scripts that exists for these kind of movies but, as we know, the Coen brothers have artistic aspirations that makes their movies such a thrill to watch.

Stardust," Witchcraft and self-irony.
","Ignorant to his heritage a young man decides to chase down and bring back a fallen star to the woman that he is in love with. This commitment brings him to go into an area outside his town village that is prohibited to enter. Once there he realizes that he has entered a fairy-tale land and that he is not the only person chasing the falling star. From here on it's more or less a long chase between him, a prince and three witches.The movie is loaded with self-irony and that is really it's best quality. I must admit that I didn't get involved and that it was more or less the humor that got my attention. I even considered if the 'fantasy'-genre no longer appeals to me but thinking back I realized that there are many movies in this genre that I like. I didn't like the casting and I really think that this has fundamental importance when watching a movie. You have to get involved with the protagonists and I didn't - except maybe for Michelle Pfeiffer (and Peter O'toole) that I think made the best of her part.Not a must see but if you can't wait to see the showdown between Bilbo Baggins and Smaug then this can do while we wait.Regards SimonPs.

I Am Legend," To find a cure or not to find a cure, that is the question.
","A lonely man with his German Shepherd drives around Manhattan as the last survivor of a man-made virus-attack. The virus has killed most of the Earth's population, turned a lot into zombie/vampire-like creatures and left around 1% of Earth's population unaffected as they are immune to that virus.That man is Robert Neville, a Colonel in the American army and also a scientist who is trying to find a cure.The story that is told the best here is the story of being lonely and how that affects our protagonist as well as showing us show he try to deal with it. The relationship with the dog becomes very essential and is portrayed with great skill without ever becoming sentimental. But that relationship of course isn't enough. In a very fundamental way Robert also needs the companionship of other humans and therefore he goes into the same store each day where he engages in light and everyday conversation with mannequins. We can both identify with his need and still it is very unsettling to watch him have these conversations. Again this works very well in the movie.In my opinion the weak part is from the point where the confrontation with the affected becomes more direct. From that point on it's more like an action-movie and the suspense and eeriness, that works so great in this movie, is therefore absent.I think that it is often easier to build-up an atmosphere but just as difficult to honor that in the climax. Also because, that what is unknown to our mind often has greater potential to scare us than what we know, no matter how horrifying the truth might be (it is rarely 'stranger than you dreamt it'). In this particular movie 'the truth' is, as stated in other reviews, CGI-made zombies/vampires and because you notice the illusion right away you calm down very much. The open fight in no way matches the paranoia and loneliness as far as scariness goes.The ending is very weak and feels very 'rushed' and I don't think that this sort of movie in the first place appeals to people who wants a happy end.Still I would recommend this to all who likes to explore, through empathy with Robert, the feelings of loneliness, paranoia and despair.Regards SimonPs.

Black Hawk Down," Ma-alinti Rangers - The Day The Rangers Came.
","In an attempt to deliver a serious blow to the warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid, American special forces on the 3. October 1993 went in to the capital of Somalia to catch two of his Lieutenants. Aidid was to some extent guilty in making the civilian population starve and an estimation of around 300.000 people died from this.The Achilleus' heel of the American forces was, that they would leave none of their fellow soldiers behind. The turning point in the mission is then when a 'Black Hawk goes down'. This makes it necessary to secure the crash site and bring all dead and wounded back and in this process the American forces looses the initiative and speed and makes it possible for Aidid to counter-attack. The fighting escalates further and about 18 hours later 18 American soldiers are dead. This incident apparently made Defence Minister Les Aspin resign and also made USA more cautious about getting into conflicts abroad - at least until the Bush Doctrine.Journalist Mark Bowden decided to write a book about the incident and later Ridley Scott decided to make a movie based on the book. When you have read the book you will notice that a lot of odd and sometimes funny anecdotes from it are present in the movie. Although the book as well as the movie tells the story from the American soldiers viewpoint the book tries to show how the fighting affects the civilians in Mogadishu. I think that this is an important aspect when you are trying to show what war is about. War is not just about the (American) soldier - war is also about the 'enemy'. Who is he? Does he care for those who are killed? Does he feel that he protects something of importance? Does he act aggressively because he has been manipulated or maybe even because he feels that he has something to revenge? Without his perspective any description of a war will be superficial and this is in fact one of my critical claims. Both from an ethical point of view but I also think that the story itself suffers from this one-sided perspective. I think that the movie feels quite 'lengthy' and that it wouldn't necessary be so if we had gotten some of stories from the 'other side'. I think that there are always moral dilemmas involved when the decision is to go to war (as well as when you don't) but that this movie doesn't deal with them. Why not? Moral dilemmas are interesting and showing them isn't the same as not being loyal towards those soldiers who went in and put their life in danger. Why not show some of the more controversial stories from the book? If you spot an enemy trying to advance towards you, who at the same time holds a woman in front of him as a shield - what do you do? A Delta Force Ranger knows what he will do - and can you accept that? And of course this example isn't just a product of my imagination.A large part of the movie consists of American soldiers trying to secure the Black Hawks who has crashed. We also follow the American convoy around in Mogadishu, for a long period, who has a difficult time finding the crash sites. These parts of the movie could, in my opinion, have been minimized to create more progression in the story.There are several highlights though, like Mike Durant, Shughart and Gordon defending themselves against a big crowd.Still this movie doesn't get a top rating from me as it didn't contain enough contrasts; too much repetitious fighting.Regards SimonPs.

Into the Wild," The Tyranny in life.
","There are several things in our lives that we do not choose and these things therefore have the potential to be experienced as tyrannical elements of our life. Our parents and society could be two suggestions. We do not choose them ourselves but we really don't have other alternative but to accept them and try and get along. Or what? For the young man Christopher McCandless there is an alternative. To quit it all and become a super-tramp with the ultimate goal of 'going into the wild'. The Wild is in this particular instance Alaska.For Chris this alternative way of dealing with the tyranny of his life also means that he for some reason does not tell anybody that he will split and live his life as a vagabond. He just leaves without a word to anybody and even takes on a new identity (Alexander Supertramp) in order not to be located (maybe this change in name could also be seen as an attempt to change his identity on a psychological level). I have been thinking much about this and my conclusion is, that he either left without saying because he was afraid that if so his parents would and could persuade him not to leave or else he didn't tell them because he in some way wanted to hurt them. Either way we don't know this as it was not explored in depth and this also means that we really don't know how Chris felt about leaving everybody without saying a single word.Without focus on this aspect I think that it is very tendentious picture that is drawn of Chris. I think that he was struggling much more with personal issues than was shown to us. How could he bear not to let his sister know that he was well?I liked in particular those chance meetings Chris had along his way that developed into so much; that is a unique thing about traveling.If you are in the mood for a slow, 'small-stream' and poetic movie then I can recommend this movie without hesitation.Regards SimonPs.

The Descent," zombies in the underground
","First of all I would like to point out that I really enjoyed the movie. It is a horrifying movie, very claustrophobic and intense. I also liked that the plot didn't evolve around something superstitious (like demons coming up from the abyss) but rather around the idea that humans had stayed in the caves for centuries and had followed their own evolutionary path. This makes the movie more plausible and thereby also more scary.On the downside we have the dialogue between the girls which is both tedious and very macho - at least until the scary part starts. And here we also have a very traditional horror element; the person which is the cockier is also the person that falls the hardest (a sort of hidden morale; be prepared or else....!).You have to raise your eyebrows at the idea that these people that they meet in the caves should be able to survive by hunting wild animals. They don't use tools or weapons and they can't see. How are they going to catch a wolf? In the attempt, I will guess that they would be eaten.Well, I will surely recommend it anyway - the good parts out weights the bad parts by far./Sigmund",7,2,5,29 March 2006
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," The intergalactic Musketers finally swear their oath to each other....
","The real force of the movie is that it contains a lot of humor of the more self-ironic stuff. The group dynamics of the Guardians is, until around 2/3 into the movie, based on interpersonal conflicts that are depicted in the most funny way.When the guardians actually put aside their thirst for revenge and distrust to each other it helps them fall into their specific role that fits their special abilities and this makes them fight as a unity. I had a wish for this to happen but as it progressed I found to my surprise that it was boring. With the loss of their dark sides they became one dimensional with predictable behaviour. For instance they prove their friendship by risking their own lives saving each other, they have their moments of doubt that they overcome and they redeem themselves. All of this adds to a very solemn atmosphere that stands in a stark contradiction to the first part of the movie.This harmony cannot develop with sarcastic comments and antisocial behaviour so I am sad to say that the very happy end competes with any Disney story...The big showdown isn´t bad - the special effects are cool but everybody knows what it will up to so the suspense is absent.Regards SimonPs.

The Happening," Be careful - the plants are out to get you.
","Man has become a threat to nature and therefore it is time for payback. Plants have developed some kind of very sophisticated chemistry and it is being released in order to get rid of mankind. The chemistry works instantaneous and makes the affected very suicidal; There are some very spectacular and gruesome suicides in the movie.Mark Wahlberg together with his girlfriend tries to escape from an infected area and we follow them from Philadelphia to a remote place in the countryside where they at last overcomes the obstacles they have in their relationship because they face death and this makes them realize how strong their feelings are towards each other.The idea itself, that nature by some unknown defense mechanism is able to annihilate enemies is to me in a sense perfectly comprehensible. But not in the way that is suggested in the movie. Man is a threat because of various kind of pollution and plants would need the ability to 'reason' to infer that this is caused by man and this is of course a ridiculous thought. Man itself, the individual, is not a threat and nature has no way of 'knowing' where for example pollution or co2 comes from.A ridiculous movie with a very tiresome epilogue.Regards SimonPs.

American Gangster," huge disappointment
","I had really been looking forward to seeing this movie. Ridley Scott is one of a kind and Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe usually burn pretty much through. Still the movie was a big let down; it's a story told a million times. The story was plain and quite straight forward, very similar to other gangster movies in some respects. Many gangster movies are pretty much like this: you follow the upcoming gangster and see him make it to the top. The reason why he makes it to the top of the food chain is different from movie to movie but it has almost always to do with cruelty; scarface, untouchables and goodfellas to mention a few. Frank Lucas has that ability too but on top of that he seems like a fair guy who has a philosophy that dictates that he never shall attract attention to himself by dressing up for instance. And it also seems like he has adopted his mentors (Bumpy) behavior of giving out food on thanks giving thereby making him less prone to envy and hatred (he must have been calculating doing this or else he is a hypocrite) . And then he has the joker above them all; he skips all the middle men and gets his drugs straight from the fields in Vietnam. The Blue Magic..We shift between Frank Lucas as the before mentioned gangster and the honest hardworking cop Richie Roberts who has difficulties both in his private life as well as in his professional career. He is simply to honest (reminded me of Serpico) for his fellow cops. He gets assigned to a special drug enforcement unit and from the very beginning we assume that the two are gonna meet. The development of the story is very slow. There are some turning points in it that I didn't get at all. How did Frank, as a driver, get to be the top guy? Near the end Lucas and Roberts becomes friends which maybe isn't exactly odd but still you don't see how it came to be that way so you just have to guess. The thing that bothered me the most was, that it was told in a very uninvolved way.If you are totally new to the genre of gangster movies it might be a good one to start with since it has so many elements from previous movies incorporated but if you are familiar with the genre stay away.

The Good Shepherd," Deconstructed storyline which hasn't been dramatized properly.
","I found this movie incredible boring. Matt Damon did his best to underplay his part and he succeeded to an extent that I felt left out. Who was he really? What was his motivations? Did he care for his girlfriend, why did he take a poetry class etc? Several movies have a fairly simple plot and storyline. And sometimes you get the feeling that the director tries to deconstruct the storyline in order to add some sophistication to the movie and to challenge your intellect; they sort of deconstruct it. In this movie you constantly jump between 1941 and 1961 in a very annoying way. Its confusing and instead of keeping the suspense up you give up on the film.One of the most boring scenes that appears again and again is a scene wherein CIA agents are trying to determinate what is going on in a movie-clip with a guy and a girl lying in a bed that Matt Damon has received. It just goes on and on with a description of details from this clip without any point to this at all.This is not a story about CIA but instead a story of a young guy with autistic tendencies who is a total stranger in his own life. Sort of makes me think of 'the stranger' by Albert Camus./Sigmund",2,2,4,5 October 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," Entertaining but still very much a piece of fiction
","Watching this film made me think about the genre of 'prison'-movies and what the theme really is in these stories. All of them seem to have some common elements; the warden is a psychopath, there is almost always some inmate that is out to get the protagonist in some way, there is the companionship and last but not least the portrayal of the human spirit that will not be broken in the direst of circumstances. And maybe that is what 'shawshank' wants to tell us; that the strong individual can beat an unfair and cruel system by different means. In this story we have Andy Dufresne who is clever but also able to endure visits in 'the hole' many times without developing psychiatric phenomena. In this sense I will claim that this movie is just as much a piece of fiction as lets say 'starwars' is. It is simply not possible to stay sane if you are repeatably treated in a degrading manner and if you live in constant fear. The movie is highly entertaining but should not be seen as a serious attempt to explore human reactions in a prison environment where inmates are treated as garbage. Don't fool yourself on this account. Luke Skywalker is just as real as the character of Andy Dufresne is.Regards SimonPs.

Blade Runner," You see a tortoise lying on its back - why don't you help it?
","To be honest I don't know where to start. So many reviews have already been written probably containing what I have in mind myself. Another thing is that I have watched this movie (the original from 1982 that is) so many times and thought so much about it that it is difficult to state exactly what my opinion is. Having said that it is still one of my all time favorites. I give this 10/10 which I don't do very often, but this one deserves it.'(Batty) I have seen things you people wouldn't believe. I have seen tank ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion, I have watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost, like tears in rain. Time to die'. - (Deckard) 'I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than ever. Not just his life. Anybodys life. My life.' And then the Vangelis score. Truly a great moment in cinema history. Batty, who holds Deckards life in his hands chooses to save his life. Deckard who has hunted all the other replicants down, including Pris, is spared. Batty hereby shows us that he has developed one of the most defining characteristica of human beings; the ability to forgive. He shows us here that maybe he is 'more human, than human' as stated by the Tyrell Corporation.I really think that it is easier to give a review if you are critical of what you have seen. Here in this movie every little detail seem to come together to create a masterpiece. Even a guy like JF Sebastian who plays a very small part in the movie gives a very disturbing appearance as the lonesome scientist with his aging disease and his little robots around him to greet him when he comes home in order to comfort him. How sad. Pris, as the replicant who has started to develop feelings towards Batty, the other replicant; probably the most hopeless love ever seen. They simply don't have a chance to fulfill that love at any level. Rachael, who is beginning to grasp that she is a replicant ('how can they not know what they are' (Deckard)) The 'I only do eyes' guy (Hannibal Chew) who feels some sort of pride when confronted by Batty 'You are a nexus six right? I made your eyes'. And what does that smile mean that Batty sends him (if only you could see what I have seen with your eyes)? Every performance is memorable. The atmosphere is permeated by pessimism, estrangement and a sense of utter hopelessness. Ford of course plays his role with incredible depth. He is forced into this assignment, and he really plays Deckard as a man (or replicant) who has given up on himself and society. He does it because he doesn't really have a choice. He hunts the replicants down but without any pride or feeling of doing the right thing.Batty finally gets to confront Tyrell and gives him the 'kiss of death'. The anger behind this act has to do with the imposed misery of the replicants since they are given human thoughts and feelings but not the chance to live a life that makes it possible to reach any existential goals they might have. Tyrell is trying to make Batty accept this when he says to him: 'the flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long' but Batty doesn't want a life that is half as long since it makes it impossible for him to reach self-actualization.We have seen the same kind of theme in Mary Shelleys 'Frankenstein' where 'the monster', because it only meets hostility and mistrust, at last becomes a true monster.This theme is still very much science-fiction but who knows if we some day will be able to create artificial life. If so we will need to answer those moral dilemmas that exists in doing so and it can be argued that 'Blade Runner' tries to give us one version of how this can unfold.Regards SimonPs.

Beowulf," Madame Tussauds goes to Hollywood.
","First of all, and this is a point that was so annoying that I never really got to asses all the other aspects of the movie, the movie is digitalized or animated. For some unknown reason everything in the movie was covered with a layer of animation. This means that you never saw any acting going on. For a comedy this might work but for a movie with both tragedy and drama this is really a very unwise decision in my humble opinion. And why in heavens employ expensive actors when you are going to cover their appearance with digital effects? How they really acted or chose to interpret their character we will never know and in order to like this movie you have to be indifferent towards this. I cannot hide that I was at first quite confused and then right after very frustrated when I realized this. The animation effect was furthermore very, very amateurish. It is difficult to asses whether the animation guys on purpose had chosen to distort the facial characteristics of the actors but either way this was what happened and that was also very annoying.There isn't very much I can underline as positive. The Vikings are being portrayed as a gang of drunken and obscene imbeciles and Beowulf is the bragging hero who like to walk around naked.If you are considering spending your evening with this movie I would strongly advice against it and instead recommend Shrek 3 to you; it has trolls, heroes, dragons and animation too and on top it has a lot of humor...;-)Regards SimonPs.

Slumdog Millionaire," Hardship in the slums of Bombay
","We follow a young boy - Jamal - during a jeopardy competition. During this we see different highlights (or lowlights) of his life in either some scary flashbacks or through the interrogation that he undergoes in a police station. It must be considered common knowledge that children in development countries often suffer from hunger and abuse and the movie is a testament to that. It is a quality that the movie never becomes sentimental or tries to impose any feelings unto the viewer. What we see from the slum isn't meant to bring tears into our eyes - it is more a matter of telling us the story of the three musketeers Latika, Salim and Jamal.A basic premise in the movie is that Jamal has a destiny and that he believes that. This means that he never looses his faith during the competition and that he has a firm belief that he will eventually 'win' Latika.Personally I found that the depiction of survival in the slums of Bombay played to big a part in the movie. It was stressful to watch Salim and Jamal fighting to stay alive and it could have been minized to add more progression in the story.A minor, unsatisfying detail was the host in the Jeopardy program. He was so sarcastic towards Jamal that he became unbelievable.I will most certainly recommend this movie; it deals with an important subject without becoming political or trying to impose feelings unto the audience.Regards SimonPs.

The Pursuit of Happyness," Get rich or die trying
","This movie is about The American dream in a way that shows an important aspect of this; that you can 'pursue happynness' without the restrictions of class, caste, religion, race, or ethnic group.Chris Gardner is really struggling to achieve his dream to the point where he looses almost every thing in his life and when he finally succeeds it feels like justice has been served. So this story is a testament to the idea that it is only a matter of skill and will where you will end on the social ladder and because Chris Gardner has both in abundance he climbs to the very top.I must admit, that entertainment is important when watching a movie and that for some reason I wasn't entertained during this one. To me it felt repetitious to watch Chris Gardner struggle and it was as if the story was spiced up with humor that again felt repetitious and as if it was forced upon me. The Schizophrenic who thought that the Scanner was a time-machine wasn't one bit funny the way I saw it but it was as if I was supposed to think so.The whole deroute aspect of the story, which of course is a way of showing us how hard he fought, played to big a part. Unpaid bills, the car that got towed away, the wife that leaves him, problems with selling the scanners and so on. In my opinion this could have been showed in a much more subtle way but then again maybe this is what the whole story is about; not to give up on your dream no matter the circumstances.Chris Gardner accepts the game - he is in no way critical of the way American society works. That for instance homeless people live next to people with an income that is beyond comprehension to the average citizen. He just wants the 'Ferrari' himself and thereby the movie becomes mediocre and entirely materialistic.Regards SimonPs.

The Martian," The unbreakable American spirit colonizes Mars against all odds
","This is not a movie about a stranded guy on Mars. It's a movie about an American guy left stranded on Mars. It's not a movie the explorers true emotions in a guy completely lost in outer space. It 's a movie that shows, and salutes, high spirit and an ability to take everything with a toothpaste smile in the darkest circumstances. Its not a movie that surprises you in any way. It's a movie that tries to surprise you so much that you pretty quickly understand that this will be a consistent pattern throughout the movie.My hope was to get inside the mind of a guy left alone from earth, totally alienated, and with a challenge to sustain himself with food in a race against time. Nothing more.It doesn't show any significant amount of doubt or fear but instead it shows scenes with action again and again which eliminates any chance of connecting with the story in any empathic way.And on top of the cake you had the whole stereotype team spirit with his crew and NASA and yes, the whole American nation.
