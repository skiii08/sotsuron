Hereditary," A Master Class in Over-acting
","Another silly horror film, that while creepy, makes very little sense - or I'm just stupid. Basically, grandma was in a 'Rosemary's Baby' type cult, and upon her death, another member takes charge of having some demon king possess her grandson. Seems that the king had previously inherited the granddaughter, but being male, really wanted to inherit a male. So, in order for this to happen, there had to be decapitations, crawling on ceilings, random sitings of dead people, self hurting, and a pointless torching of dad. All this so the 'king' could inhabit perhaps the wimpiest boy on the planet. And while I'm certain the actors extended huge amounts of energy in their performances, some of the acting is so over-the-top, it crossed the line into humor. The ending just left me shaking my head, wondering why I continue to be 'had' by these supposed horror film.On the plus side, even though much of what happens makes no sense to me, the film did cause me to have some very odd yet creepy dreams involving demons at a golf tournament, which is why I gave it more stars than I think it deserves.",4,1,4,27 March 2019
Gravity," I fell for Gravity
","For me, this was one of the rare movies that lived up to expectations, and even went beyond. I don't care how the film was made, whether it was primarily computers or not, I found it an incredible accomplishment. I literally sat there with my mouth agape for the majority of the film. I don't know how it would play in 2d, but in 3d, I was actually ducking out of the way at times. Only wish I'd seen it in IMAX. Perhaps the better initiated in rocket science would find fault with the film, but it certainly seemed realistic to me, and that's all I can ask of a movie. The performances were stellar, and I felt Sandra Bullock reacted much like one would expect in the situation she'd found herself in (well, except for those of us who would have just completely lost it and tried to swim for home). To all involved with this film, thanks for the experience.",10,3,6,13 October 2013
This Is the End," This is the End of me ever attending a Seth Rogen creation
","This was perhaps THE worst movie I've ever seen. Perhaps my wife and I are simply too old for the subject matter (50s), but sex-oriented jokes, drug use, and constant use of the f-word do not a humorous movie make - and we are not prudish people, particularly my wife. I think I smiled once, and I heard my wife giggle once, but I was as close to walking out of a movie as I've ever come. I doubt there was much of a script involved, and my guess is that all of the actors were told to ad-lib the nastiest sex joke that could get an 'R' rating they could think of. I mean a five minute scene about ejaculating all over someone's house...??? Hardy-har-har. I now hate Danny McBride even more than I did before this garbage, and what the hell was Emma Watson thinking.There is absolutely NOTHING I can recommend about this movie, and I think it's the only one I've ever given 1 star to. Complete garbage. The only way I'll ever attend another movie that Seth Rogen is in is if he shows up unexpectedly in a bit part. He and his pal Evan Goldberg have no writing talent whatsoever, and I can't say much about Rogen's acting either. How they make a living in this business is beyond explanation. Thanks for this utter waste of time fellas. You got me.",1,341,605,23 June 2013
Us," More funny than scary
","The parts that were purposely comical had me laughing out loud, but I didn't find the movie to be scary at all. I didn't find 'Get Out' particularly scary either, so take that into account. When this film was over, my first thought was that it didn't make much sense, and I laughed at myself for watching it. Not something I'd recommend.",5,0,1,16 December 2019
Once," Wow
","I came across 'Once' at Blockbuster while browsing through the selections, and vaguely remembered reading some positive reviews on it. So, '28 Weeks Later' went back on the shelf, and 'Once' replaced it in my hand. I'd just seen 'Halloween' (the 2007 version), and wasn't really in the mood for another gorefest immediately afterward anyway (not that there's anything wrong with a good gorefest). When I got home, I checked out the reviews for 'Once' on IMDb, and though pleased to see the high rating, was also prepared for a bit of disappointment, as it is extremely rare that a well-rated movie meets my expectations. As the ending credits for 'Once' rolled, I sat mesmerized. It was absolutely fantastic. The characters seemed so real that you almost felt like you were watching a documentary. This movie is not a musical in the usual sense, as the characters do not sing dialog to one another, but it is certainly full of music. The story is not a unique one, but it is well-told and very believable. While most out here obviously enjoyed the film, I do think those who do not like the music may not, so there will definitely be an audience of detractors. Most of us, apparently, are not among them, and I urge you to find out where you stand for yourself. If you hate the song in the music store (which happens early-on), then you may not want to sit through the rest of 'Once,' but if that song leaves you wanting to hear more, you're in for a real treat.",10,3,4,26 December 2007
Crash," Watched it Twice - Still not Convinced
","I first saw and commented on this film in 2005, before it won the best picture Oscar. I did not think it deserved the high rating it had on this site at the time. While I found it very watchable and never boring, I thought, like many, it had contrived extreme situations in an effort to beat us over the head with the message that racism is bad. The term 'After School Special' has been used by a number of reviewers, and that's exactly what came to mind upon my first viewing. Some time after it won the Oscar, and after having discussed the film with one of his teachers, my high-school-aged son decided to give 'Crash' a look, so I decided to watch it with him to validate or rescind my previous opinion. While a second viewing revealed that some of the situations were perhaps not as extreme as initially perceived, I still came away thinking there were too many flaws for this to even be considered a best picture, much less win it.There is the scene early on where the cops pull over the black couple, and Dillon's character claims he saw them doing a sex act. Uh, is he supercop, with x-ray vision that can see through metal and fabric? He saw nothing other than a woman pop up and appear in the passenger seat. Sure, we know what the implications are, but she could just as easily have been picking something up that she'd dropped on the floor. None of the characters seemed to question this.If you were making a purchase in a store and the owner insulted you, particularly with racial slurs, are you going to give him your business or get your money back and go elsewhere? Is there only one gun store in LA? The dialog surrounding the first carjacking scene was silly. A black man argues that the body language of white people indicates they perceive danger when in the vicinity of African Americans, then goes on to prove the perception is valid. Later on in a discussion with her husband, Sandra Bullock's character indicates she was in fact afraid that night, then goes on to imply that her husband should have realized that and done something to prevent the carjacking. What should he have done I wonder, say 'hey guys, please don't do anything bad to us, seeing as how you're black and all.' The scene between the locksmith and Turkish store owner where the owner kept insisting the locksmith was trying to cheat him by not replacing his door was something straight out of Monty Python.And on and on.Again, a watchable movie, but one with too many flaws to be considered Oscar-worthy. I don't know what picture should have won the best picture Oscar in 2005, but I definitely don't think it was this one.",6,9,13,25 May 2007
BlacKkKlansman," Entertaining with a powerful ending
","I've read a number of the reviews here before writing my own, and I believe both the positive ones and negative ones have merit. First, I find the assertion that this is about a black man who infiltrated the Klan a bit misleading. Mr. Washington didn't personally infiltrated the Klan as much as his 'surrogate' did. Without Driver's character, the 'infiltration' does not exist.My main concern with any film based on a true story is, how much of it is true, how much is stretching the truth, and how much is just made up. Reading some of the reviews, it seems that much of this story is made up, though I have no doubt it captures to a fairly accurate degree some of the attitudes that were prevalent during the time period when the event took place, and incorporates events that occurred but weren't related to this particular story.Regardless, I did enjoy the film, and even found Driver's performance acceptable (I usually find him rather boring in his acting style). Much of what I presume is false with regard to the actual story created a decent suspense picture, with a few moments of comic relief thrown in that worked. I suspect that those who are not fans of Trump as president, like myself, will like it more than those who are, as no attempt is made to hide the political viewpoint of director Lee. The ending, featuring recent live footage, paints a powerful picture of just how little progress we've made on race relations, and was easily the most emotional segment of the film for me.",7,3,6,21 August 2018
Knocked Up," Knocked Out by Knocked Up
","I'm afraid this movie actually put me to sleep. I eventually woke before it was over, but I merely sat through it gratuitously because I hate to get movies then not watch them. I'm no prude, but I found this movies message that it's great fun to do drugs to be rather offensive and dangerous. Do our teens really need such examples? On top of that, the movie simply wasn't very funny. As I said, I'm no prude, as is evidenced by the fact I thought 'American Pie' was hilarious, but this movie just hit me the wrong way for some reason, much like Clerks 2 did I suppose. I plan to take a look at 'Superbad' when it comes out, and perhaps I'll have a more favorable opinion of that, but I think 'Knocked Up' was definitely a step down from 'Virgin.'",9,0,2,9 October 2007
Lost in Translation," A Reel Yawner
","If this wins an Academy Award for anything, then the Academy is totally whacked.  Believe the other reviews that note this film as boring. It's true, absolutely nothing happens.  Perhaps you'd enjoy watching Bill Murray brood for two hours.  If so, be my guest.  There is a scene in the movie that was obviously thrown in just so it could garner its R rating, otherwise, it could be rated PG.  There were a couple of scenes early on that did actually make me laugh, so I thought there was some promise.  I was fooled.  This is nothing more than a sleeping pill wrapped in a DVD.  It's not a romance, it's not a comedy, and I certainly wouldn't call it a drama. Perhaps you can figure out what it is, but it really isn't worth your effort.",Null,0,0,7 February 2004
The Revenant," Spectacular, yet spectacularly slow
","The visuals in this film are stunning, and it absolutely draws you into the atmosphere. I can't imagine what all involved went through to capture some of these scenes. It deserves to be seen on the big screen, and, perhaps, is the only way it will really be appreciated since the cinematography is really the star here. What action there is is spectacular, but the film moves along at an extremely slow pace. In one scene where characters were sleeping, I heard snoring, which seemed rather appropriate. However, when I continued to hear the same snoring during other scenes, I realized one of the patrons near me had fallen asleep (and slept through most of the film). A man sitting next to me also spent a large amount of viewing time with his chin on his chest. I personally fought off sleep a time or two as well, but never succumbed.In short, the filmmaking itself is a spectacle to behold, and the special effects are fantastic, but this isn't an action epic, so I'd suggest not going to the theater tired. Oh, and I'd also suggest eating BEFORE you see this, because you might not have much appetite afterward. Reasons will become evident if you see the film.",7,7,16,9 January 2016
The Men Who Stare at Goats," I keep getting duped by previews
","I thought this would be similar to something the Coen bros. might put out when it first previewed. I was wrong. While it was good for a chuckle or two, I found it boring for the most part, and am still not quite sure what the 'mission' was that served as the motivation for the main characters. I also couldn't figure out if it was making fun of the men with 'special powers,' or if it was paying homage to them. Basically, I think someone tried to make a story out of something that really wasn't worthy of one. Perhaps the filmmakers tried to stay too close to real-life events. I think the material could have been used as the basis for a very funny fictional film. As it was, I couldn't wait for this one to end.",5,14,24,22 November 2009
American History X," Waaaaaaaay Overrated
","There is only one reason for the high user ratings this movie receives. Because of its subject matter, people like it because they think they SHOULD.  To dislike it might cause one to be perceived as being insensitive to racial issues, but anyone looking at this film with a critical eye will find that its shortcomings make it practically laughable.  The basketball scene itself is so silly, it single-handedly destroys any credibility this film might have had.  Others have already noted the unbelievable dinner and prison scenes as well.  A lifetime of hate - instant contrition.  How can anyone possibly take this thing seriously?  There are far greater movies on racial injustice, 'Mississippi Burning' being one that comes to mind quickly.  AHX should be closer to the bottom 250 than it is to the top.",9,5,9,12 March 2004
No Country for Old Men," Didn't get it.
","I've seen all of the Coen Bros. films, and have had no trouble following the story-lines - until now. I was left with far too many questions in the end to give this film a high rating. I tried to like it, given it's critical reviews, but found portions of it rather boring, and also couldn't figure out how certain characters got involved in the story at all. They often seemingly appeared out of nowhere, leaving you to ponder who they were and what relationship they had to other characters as the movie rolled on. And the ending has been well-documented. I would guess most viewers basically zone out at that point anticipating the next bit of action, and the next bit of action is the credits scrolling by. Fargo and The Big Lebowski remain on top of my Coen Bros. list, with No Country perhaps bringing up the rear. I have no trouble with movies that reqire some thought, but am not a big fan of those that simply try to confuse you.",8,7,13,22 November 2007
Mamma Mia!," The over-60 crowd loved it
","Saw this in an older theater that is apparently frequented by seniors aged 60 and above - at least that's my impression based on the attendance when I was there. I was surprised at just how crowded the theater was given the movie's been out a few weeks now. I enjoy much of ABBA's music (a must for anyone seeing this film), and found the movie watchable and mildly amusing throughout, but while I sat there with a slight smile on my face, the older folks would break into raucous laughter regularly. The performances were enjoyable, though I would have liked to have seen someone like Hugh Jackman in Pierce Brosnan's role because I understand Mr. Jackman can actually sing (but I give Mr. Brosnan credit for expanding his boundaries, and he certainly wasn't terrible). The movie is also very colorful, so in general, it's a rather 'happy' experience all around. Not a film I'll remember for long, but pleasant and relatively innocent, though I will warn that some themes and suggestive words/behaviors will likely offend the most conservative viewers.",6,1,2,4 August 2008
Mulholland Drive," Not for me
","When I spend 2 1/2 hours watching a movie, I sure as heck would like to have some idea of what it was about. This is not such a movie. I believe this was nothing more than an attempt to disguise lunacy as genius. It's been done before ('Lost in Translation' anyone). I certainly don't mind having to think about what I'm watching, but give me 'Memento,' 'Requiem for a Dream,' 'Irreversible,' or any of a number of others over this tripe. If anyone watching this had any idea of what was going through Mr. Lynch's mind at the time, then my hat's certainly off to you. On the plus side, as others have mentioned, the performance of Naomi Watts is incredible, and the film might be worth watching for that alone. But I wouldn't bother trying to understand it. You'll likely just hurt yourself.",4,5,13,15 April 2007
La La Land," Musical for the first half, romantic drama for the second
","I love movies like 'Once' and 'Sing Street,' that feature music but aren't truly musicals in that the dialog isn't sung. I'm not at all a fan of the musical where nearly all the dialog is sung. I was a little worried during the start of 'La La Land' that we'd encountered the latter, and while the musical numbers were entertaining, they were pretty ordinary. However, as the movie progressed, the singing decreased, and the dialog and story got more interesting. Ultimately, I enjoyed the film and the music, and thought it struck a nice balance between dialog that was sung and dialog that was spoken. Nice performances by Gosling and Stone as well, and I appreciated the ending, which wasn't quite what many might expect or want.",7,4,8,3 January 2017
The King," Deserves a Crown
","I usually enjoy movies set in this time period, and this one was exceptional. Excellent story, well-acted, and beautifully filmed. I'm not a student of medieval warfare, but this looked like what I imagine such battles would look like, with the men actually tiring and fighting with everything they had. Highly recommend even if kings and knights aren't your thing.",8,3,7,3 November 2019
The Shape of Water," Best Picture - Not So Much
","Saw most of the movies nominated for best pic for 2017, but had not seen this one although I had wanted to. Had already determined I was going to see it the day after the Oscar awards, and had my interest piqued further when it won best picture. Perhaps it was due to having high expectations, but I left the theater feeling that it not only should not have won best picture, it shouldn't have been nominated. While it was very cleverly filmed, and no doubt required a lot of hard work to bring to the screen, I found it rather boring and stereotypical for this sort of genre. When the creature was first shown, I thought the make-up was incredible, but as the movie went on, it looked more and more like it was just a man in a rubber suit. And while obviously this kind of event isn't likely to ever happen, it can at least be made somewhat believable, but some of the scenes were ridiculous even for the subject matter. For me, '3 billboards' should have won best picture for 2017. I thought it far more original than 'Shape,' and actually cared about what happened to the characters. With 'Shape,' I found I didn't care much about any of them.",5,7,13,12 March 2018
Zombieland," Joining the detractor chorus
","I have to join the small chorus of detractors of this film. The opening was very promising, but there was little gore and few laughs afterward. Based on the previews, I expected a little more emphasis on the zombie-kill-of-the-week theme, but what you saw in the previews was pretty much what you got (and how does one actually kill a zombie anyway?). Obviously one has to suspend disbelief for these types of movies, but they can be done in a logical sense to some degree, and this one simply defies all logic. How does one run an amusement park ride and ride it at the same time - and why would you even get on a ride when being chased by zombies? By the time the final confrontation occurred in the amusement park, I had actually dozed off. Too much time spent on character-development, and not enough zombie confrontation. My 14-year-old son also commented that the movie was boring. I fully expected to love this movie, so perhaps that was my problem. Maybe if I had been dragged to it, it would have exceeded my expectations. As it stands, I wouldn't recommend it.",5,18,34,5 October 2009
Joker," Actually dozed off a time or two
","Phenomenal performance by Phoenix, as he was in every scene, but overall, I found the film a bit boring. My wife didn't attend with me because she'd read about how violent it was, but there was really only one particularly violent scene, and when it occurred over half-way through the film, my first thought was 'about time.' Not sure what I expected, but based on the hype, I expected to stay more engaged with the characters and story. Mostly, I was taken by how much wait Phoenix had lost for the role.",6,3,14,10 October 2019
Dark Shadows," Promising Beginning, but downhill from there.
","I liked the filming technique of the beginning and the way the stage was set for the rest of the story, but it was mostly a disappointment after that. I was expecting something much funnier and unique, but, as others have noted, ALL of the funny scenes were shown in the ads for the film, and the plot was one we've seen a zillion times. The film wasn't particularly scary, funny, or dramatic, so I'm not sure what it was supposed to be.I don't want to include any spoilers here, so am trying to not divulge much, but some of the scenes and characterizations make little sense, and, unless I missed it, the relationship of those living in the mansion to Barnabas' family is never explained. We're just left to assume they are somewhere in the Collins line.Some of the special effects are cool, but I wish they had at least shown a little more gore since there was nothing else very interesting about the film. Also, I did not like the 70s style in which it was shot.Overall, one of the more disappointing films I've seen given my expectations. Better luck next movie I hope.",5,0,1,16 May 2012
Hancock," Fully met expectations
","I guess movies like this show us why we'll never all get along. This movie has been panned by nearly every 'professional' critic out there. Frankly, I'd stop paying these clowns if I was their employers. They don't watch movies from a layman's point of view. I saw this movie at a Friday matinée in a well-populated theater, and judging from audience reaction, it was very well received. Perhaps those who disliked the movie were expecting a spoof, which the advertising did lead you to believe. But ultimately, while there are some comic moments, the film turns out to be more of a character study in line with something like 'Unbreakable,' which I thoroughly enjoyed as well. My sons (18 and 12) and I found 'Hancock' to be very enjoyable and never boring. As far as I'm concerned, it's been seriously underrated by the paid critics, and somewhat underrated by the amateurs out here. Don't go in expecting a spoof, and you'll likely enjoy it as well.",8,2,5,4 July 2008
Arrival," I had no idea - again and again
","Perhaps I'm just stupid, but I simply didn't get it. No idea how the two separate life forms featured in the film were eventually able to understand each other. No idea what the purpose of the alien visit was. No idea what Jeremy Renner's character had to do with anything. No idea what time period Amy Adam's character was living in. No idea how Amy Adam's character was able to stop the Chinese from attacking the aliens. No idea why the daughter had to die or how her life tied into anything. No idea why Adams and Renner were expelled from the ship by the Aliens at one point. No idea why it was thought the aliens had spoken of a 'weapon.' No idea how this has received an 8 rating (at the time of this review) on IMDb.I'm amazed at the 'alphabet' the writer of this film was able to develop, but for me, it was one of those movies that is supposed to be intelligent yet makes little sense to most viewers. The special effects were well done, but it's a rather tedious journey to a very unsatisfying ending.",5,1,1,23 November 2017
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Vicky Christina BOREcelona
","The movie's been over for about 10 minutes now, and I'm STILL waiting for something to happen. Honestly, I wanted to turn it off and go to bed before Penelope Cruz's character even showed up, but given she won an academy award for the part, I thought I'd stick it out. Well, she played her part fine, but it wasn't worth the wait. I suppose my expectation that a Woody Allen movie be at least remotely funny affects my opinion of anything he does, and this film provoked nary a snicker much less a laugh. I also think ol' Woody has quite a few fantasies about Ms. Johansson (sp?), based on her roles in his recent films. The narration of this film also was very annoying to me, both in dialog and the chosen voice. I think it would have been less so if Woody had done the narration himself.Anyway, if you're a fan of old Woody Allen, this one isn't going to win you back. Frankly, I don't know who this film would appeal to at all - perhaps women who hate their marriages and get a daily dose of romance novels.",4,6,14,7 March 2009
Unbroken," Utmost Respect for Ms. Jolie
","First, I did not read the book, so cannot make any comparison. My wife and I were interested in seeing this movie after seeing an interview with Louie on 'CBS Sunday Morning.' We both enjoyed the movie. Obviously the entire book would not fit into the time allotted for a feature film, but we felt this captured the most significant part of Louie's story, his survival when faced with ridiculous odds. Yes, it might have been interesting to see more of his pre-war days and his post-war days, but the film was more about one man's incredible spirit rather than about the man himself.Some have indicated they thought the movie dragged on, but I never had any sense of how long it was. The action scenes were expertly done and very realistic looking, at least to someone who never experienced similar moments, and I thought the portrayal of the prison camp gave a good sense of the suffering involved.But the most amazing thing to me, and why Ms. Jolie jumped a peg or two in my eyes, is that I don't recall a single vulgarity in the film, and that's unheard of these days, especially a war film. Don't get me wrong, I've cursed plenty and have no problem with cursing in films, but I do think it gets overused and often has no relevance to either the story or characters. It was very refreshing to watch a film where the director (or perhaps writers) felt similarly.",8,3,8,5 January 2015
The Hangover Part III," No charm here
","They should have stopped after 1, though 2 was not terrible. This one, however, was simply a way of sucking more money out of the series, and they got some of ours (though fortunately at matinée prices). There are some laughs, but not nearly as many as you'd expect, and they've turned Chow into too significant a character. He was much funnier in the shorter role in the original. They've also put too much emphasis on the suspense portion of the plot (an it's not particularly suspenseful at that). Alan's character moves from being that of a naive innocent to something far crueler and darker, which I didn't enjoy either. The funniest part of the movie, and the one that takes you back to the appeal of the original, occurs after the credits start to roll, so don't run out in disgust once they do.If you really want to see how the series ends, save yourself some cash and wait for the video release. Wish we had spent out money on something else.",4,6,12,26 May 2013
Click," It's not 'It's a Wonderful Life,' but it is a wonderful movie
","I saw this with my 10-year-old and his friend. The premise was a little confusing to them, but they enjoyed the comic moments. I, on the other hand, was quite pleasantly surprised, though I must admit I've enjoyed most of Adam Sandler's movies. While nothing here had me splitting my sides, there were plenty of laughs, and as many have already noted, plenty of tears as well. Any movie that elicits this much emotion is a good movie as far as I'm concerned. While the basic message may be similar to that of 'It's a Wonderful Life,' the conventions for stating it are much different. One thing this movie has confirmed for me is that 'professional' critics are basically pompous a**es who have no idea what the general public will enjoy in a film. I was obviously not the only person in the theater enjoying this one. Chances are, you'll like it too.",8,1,3,26 June 2006
Inside Llewyn Davis," Stay Outside of 'Inside Llewyn Davis'
","The wife and I have been looking forward to this film coming here ever since we saw previews in December. I enjoy most of the Coen Bros. movies and the quirky characters they create. Unfortunately, this contained none of those, and was a chore to sit through. Some of the encounters are entertaining, but overall, the story just isn't that interesting. The music got rather tiresome after a while as well. Something a little up-beat thrown in might have helped keep me from fighting against my eyelids. There was very little to laugh at here as well, which is also not generally the case with the Coen Bros. Hopefully their next effort will be back in form. I don't know that even the die-hards will enjoy this one.",6,14,26,10 January 2014
The Ugly Truth," I was preparing to lambaste the professional critics...
","... based on some of the reviews here, and also on the fact that I've seen a number of critically panned movies that I liked quite a bit, but I have to agree with the pros here. I didn't find this movie to be particularly funny or romantic, and certainly nothing original (which isn't necessarily a reason to dislike a film). There was some laughter sporadically in the theater where I attended, but many of the jokes fell really flat, and what was supposed to be funny was met with complete silence (even my girlfriend didn't laugh as much as she normally does). 'P.S. I Love You' was a much better romantic effort from Butler, and I haven't really liked Heigel much since her film about the Special Olympics (can't remember the name off-hand).For me, 'The Proposal' was a much better effort than this, and I'm looking forward to 'Couple's Retreat' to pull me out of the rom-com doldrums. Hopefully it lives up to it's previews. I don't recommend 'The Ugly Truth.'",5,1,6,1 August 2009
The Martian," More focused on science than anything
","My feelings mirror much of what nemenemenes said below in his review. In terms of marooned characters, I felt comparatively little for Damon's here than I did for Hanks and Bullock in 'Castaway' and 'Gravity,' or for the astronauts in 'Apollo 13.' The only explanation I can think of for this is that absolutely no relationships were established for Damon's character prior to the isolation, so you had no point of reference for the type of person he was. You only knew he was smart.From a technical standpoint, the film is amazing. A huge amount of work and detail went into creating the sets and verbalizing the science (which most lay people would assume was accurate, but amazing even if fabricated), but that seemed to be where all the attention went. Frankly, I was bored with most of the film. One can only listen to someone spouting scientific formulas for so long before nodding off.The film finally picked up for me in the final act, so to speak, but that wasn't worth the price of the ticket. And I don't think I would have missed anything by watching it in 2d either, as I didn't see a lot of 3d effects.I actually feel bad for not liking the movie because of the tremendous amount of effort that went into making it, but unless I feel something for the characters in dramas such as this, even if it's negative, I'm generally left feeling disappointed.",5,7,69,3 October 2015
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Not as funny as expected.
","The movie was entertaining enough, but I never found myself 'cracking up' at it, and some of the funnier scenes I saw in the previews didn't even make it to the final cut. I found myself laughing the hardest at some of the line's from 'Ricky's' sons, and I did enjoy the prayer segment (which I don't think should have been offensive to anyone). Regarding product placement, who cares! Unless you're a complete dolt who buys things just because they show up in a movie, you shouldn't be affected by it, and as others have already noted, it would be a bit tough to avoid in a movie featuring NASCAR. What I do find annoying are the commercials they play before the movie even starts, most of which we see almost daily on the television. You'd think they could at least come up with something akin to the super bowl commercials, but I digress. Anyway, to summarize, mildly entertaining fare, but if you've seen the previews, you've already seen most of the funny stuff.",5,0,2,7 August 2006
