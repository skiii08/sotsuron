Resident Evil: Afterlife," It was OK
","This is a OK Film, When I started, I really liked it but after a while I got very very bored until I finally turned it off, I would say that this Film is good, But if something else catches your attention, you may quickly start to lose Interest in the Film. So overall, It is a very good action film, But if you start of do something else other than the Film, You may lost Interest and get Bored after a while of it or If something else catches your attention, But If you are focused on the Film, You will probably enjoy it the whole way through more, I give it a 4 out of 10. That was my review, I hope that you found this Review helpful.",Null,1,3,29 July 2011
Cars 2," Good!
","I really liked this Film, I through that it was a lot more interesting than the First, Like the Fact there there was spy's in the Film trying to stop the Grand Prix Race and there were many countries all competing in the Race. And Instead of Just one Place, The Film was Spread out into Different Parts of the World (I remember seeing in Italy and the UK) Instead of what probably the first one was just in the United States. Overall, When I watched it, I really liked it, But i do think that it got a bit boring in the Middle and redeemed itself near the End. I do think that Kids would Enjoy this Film.",5,1,4,22 July 2011
