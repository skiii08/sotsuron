Scarface," I always tell the truth, even when I lie
","One of my all-time favorite movies! Pacino was brilliant as Montana! His character wasn't the best person in the world, but he also wasn't someone you wanted as an enemy. The government dubbed him as a bad guy b/c he was involved with drugs but at heart he was genuinely a good guy! (maybe I'm just sweet on him) Tony didn't have the closest family, but family was something he was big on! He laid eyes on Elvira and KNEW that he wanted her as his wife, the mother of his children, and the woman he wanted to share his life with. Initially, he was all about money and trying to make enough for him and his friends to survive the next month. When he met Elvira, everything he did from that point on was to impress her and get her on his team! There's so much to this movie, this review won't capture it all!!! But I loved Tony and the fight in him. He was a protector! He made sure he took care of those close to him and unfortunately in the end, no one was left to protect him. Everything he cared about he lost...He killed his best friend, his wife left him, his mother disowned him, his sister was killed. In the end, he had nothing left except for his drugs and his money... And of course, we all know how the movie ends. Even though the movie is quite a few hours long, it's worth it!",Null,0,2,14 September 2011
