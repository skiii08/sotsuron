The Monuments Men," This Was Not a Trivial Pursuit.
","This film, written by George Clooney, produced by George Clooney, starring George Clooney gives the movie-goer the illusion that this World War II mission was accomplished by a bunch of buddies on a European romp. Not disrespectful enough? Add Clooney writing himself eye-rolling soliloquies, soliloquies that trivializes the person he is portraying, rendering him disingenuous. Clooney seems to have forgotten that the men on this mission were real people, not characters from 'Ocean's Eleven.' Such a shame that the memories of these men would be mangled by a monumental ego, an ego on a quest for his own monument. A monument named Oscar. Who better to sculpt it but himself?Avoid 'The Monuments Men.' Instead hope that this brave and wonderful story is later told in the proper manner, as a documentary. For this is a story that needs to be remembered accurately, not only for the men that preserved the monuments, but also for the memories of the monumental lives that were so callously and tragically stolen.",3,6,13,10 February 2014
Downfall," When Belief Became Madness......
","..Nazi Germany was born and when belief became madness, Berlin fell at the hands of the Allies. In the craze of the Fuehrer's final days, 'Downfall' lets us see into the souls of men that allowed the madness to rule their compassion, their judgment. As the fate of the German people becomes bleaker and bleaker, as Berlin is invaded by the Russians, the men who cower in their Bunker to lead them into doom refuse to cease the madness of Hitler, instead allowing him to fill the country with false hope while pointing an accusing finger at his Generals and laying the blame of defeat at the German people who so mistakenly followed him into power and mistakenly believed in a cruel false prophet.A story of the final days of the Reich as lived in The Bunker, 'Downfall' is a film of amazing performances, a gripping drama where the end is clear and historically known, yet still draws you in and takes you to a place so dark, so evil; you wish you could find another ending.Sadly you can't. Innocent children still die at the hands of their mother, Hitler dissolves into a gray, stooped, frenetic, trembling mass of insanity, Eva Braun still dances gaily and smiles through the end of a war that took an awful toll from the heart of humanity.When watching 'Downfall' you quickly forget you are watching a movie, you forget the people on the screen these are simply actors (amazing, gifted actors), who make magic with a compelling script.If you watch one foreign film this year, make it 'Downfall.' You will walk away baffled, at the lengths blind loyalty will go; at the immense sacrifice one country made to follow an impossible, imperialistic, hateful, hedonistic dream.Yet because of a movie like 'Downfall' you will learn that not all Germans were Nazi's and some Germans were just people that simply loved their country and the people in it.The lesson of Downfall is...may we never again see a 'Downfall' as wrenching as this one, for in the film lays a vivid warning for the entire world to see, for the price the German people paid in the end of WWII was very, very steep.",10,3,5,10 May 2007
Music and Lyrics," Pleasant and Predictable
","Pleasant and Predictable, 'Music and Lyrics' is everything you would expect out of this type of movie, with a little heart and soul and a touch of love and laughter added in. Perfect fare for your little tween queen, 'Music and Lyrics' offers Hugh Grant dancing in tight pants, Drew Barrymore acting cute and quirky, and Brad Garret as the pragmatic, befuddled manager of Hugh Grant's has-been 80's rocker teen 'dream'.You will be tickled with the silly dance sequences and the satirical references to Britney Spears are gentle and comical, without a spirit of mean. Kristen Johnson (Third Rock from the Sun) adds sparkle to the movie as Barrymore's loving, no-nonsense older sister. Just don't expect any surprises and you won't be disappointed. While 'Music and Lyrics' won't make you sing it's praises, neither will you leave the theater feeling robbed and cheated of the price of your ticket.Great Sunday matinÃ©e fare, perfect for dinner and a movie, 'Music and Lyrics' is a flick best seen with all of your favorite chicks.",6,1,2,17 February 2007
