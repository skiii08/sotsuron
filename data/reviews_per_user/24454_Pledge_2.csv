Alien 3," Worthy successor to an excellent series...
","This is a very underrated film. A first time debut by David Fincher. For some reason, people love to hate the film, or haven't seen it but assume it's no good becasue of comments they've heard from others. I loved it from the beginning. Fincher manages to make an art of displaying disturbing images on the screen. And I do mean art. Some of his camera pans and angles are to be savored.I think many wanted to see another Cameron adaptation. More aliens, bigger guns and big explosions. This film finished the Alien trilogy in style. It refused to become the hollywood shoot 'em up that was the logical extension of Aliens. It instead focused on the original premise. In a few short words 'Aliens are bad, but not necessarily as bad as humans'.The atmosphere is one of hopelessness. We see Ripley as weary as she should be after so long a journey frought with so much misery. At 'the ass end of space' she finds spirits as worn as her own. Likely the reason a penal colony was chosen as the setting. Fincher has to be commended to have the courage to bring such a stark dreary vision to realization. And, to kill off such a strong and popular character (at least that's what I thought at the time).This movie is an excellent third installment. Standing alongside the first two as an equal. With yet another talented director taking the reins and adapting to his own vision.As a final testament, there I was, having seen the first two over and over again, literally sitting on the edge of my seat during the Alien baiting sequence. There was some serious suspense generated there. Who would have thought that could happen after seeing dozens of Aliens running around in the second film and only having one tinier one in this!Give it a try, and appreciate it for the different, yet true, take on the Alien experience it is.",9,0,4,5 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The legend begins...
","Wow, I wish I could have Lucas' job. Scene after scene of just sitting there thinking 'what can i create now?'. He is someone who is obviously so enthralled with creating new worlds at every turn. One can't help but be amazed at each new idea he brings to fruition.I love the movie. But it's not the same as the first three. One has a definite sense that they are watching legendary characters fulfilling their destinies. There is also the 'cutsie factor' of Jar Jar and the obvious kids appeal of the young main character.On a technical point of view the film is bulletproof. Only Cameron, Spielberg and Lucas can pull this off when they want to. At every turn, we are presented with extraordinary situations, unusual characters and improbable circumstances. But we never stand up and say 'oh that was stupid' or 'that would never happen'. Why, because he fleshes out these preposterous ideas so well. The senate council chamber, the pod race... In the hands of any other director, guys running around with big glowing sticks would be silly. Yet the final lightsaber duel is nothing short of spectacular.I think the poor reviews are really not a surprize or something to worry about. The fans love it. Many reviewers are still sitting on the sidelines not getting it. While likely when they saw the first series, they didn't get that either, but now reference them as classics simply because of growing support over the years. Were the first ones to be released now, they would likely can them too.All I can say is thank god it's doing so well at the box office, I can't wait for the net installment.",9,0,0,5 June 1999
