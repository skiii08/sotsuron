Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Incredible
","Q has brought the art of surprise to a new whole level.  I sat in the theater this afternoon, chewing my fingernails just waiting for the story to unfold.  Even the high school kid chatter and the annoying cell phone couldn't pry my eyes which were glued to this masterpiece.  If you considered vol. 1 to be a master piece, vol. 2 was a work from the hands of God.  The thought process and emotions of Q are on a level I've never seen anyone imagine.  I feel that it's as if he routes an RCA cable to his brain, to paper, to the camera, and then to the screen.  The humor, the dialogue, the shots of the feet, are all just small pieces of the puzzle to his complex brain.I don't want to give anything away, but if you want to see one heck of a great movie, view this.  I sure will be at the theater tomorrow.",10,1,2,16 April 2004
