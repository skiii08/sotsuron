The Ring," The Ring lacked some important horror/thriller essentials.
","The movie lacked the scary movie energy.  It would hype up some intense scenes, but do nothing with it.  The last ten minutes was the only thing worth seeing if you went to see a scary thriller.  The only reason why anybody should go see it, is because it is around Halloween time and there is nothing else in the theatres.",5,0,0,23 October 2002
