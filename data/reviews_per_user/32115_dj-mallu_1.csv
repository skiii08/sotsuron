BORAT.. is just a loser immigrant tries to go across America to meet Pamela Anderson.. because he fell in love with her watching Bay Watch.. and it gets crazy and crazier.. for the first time in my movie experience i was lag laughing.. this movie is a blast.. if u easily get offended or if u have little kids Please don't go to this movie and post a bad review.. just STAY AWAY from it.. other people might enjoy it!!!!PS: there is a fight scene in the hotel. try to keep your eyes open..DJ_MaLLU",10,2,13,5 November 2006
