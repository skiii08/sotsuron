Black Swan," A piece of fine art.
","I have to admit I saw this film 2 times in 2 successive days, I was just amazed by 'Natalie' performance that I have to see it again soon and could not just wait for the DVDNegative : OK this film is basically simple one, it is not 'eyes wide shut' it is about the basic idea ''good and/versus evil'' it is about good and evil together and against each other is what makes life perfect .. the director make no subtle complicated hints, everything is clear and obvious (sometimes I felt he thinks that the audience are bloody stupid, which, let us face it, is just true).Positive: the performance make this a master piece .. Natalie Portman was amazing Â… her performance was nerve wrecking .. she actually make us feel the Horror rising in her as she discovers that she is slowly moving from the good to the evil side (she had to otherwise she would loose everything she ever worked for) .. she simply must get the Oscar for a such a performance.this is not a classical film with beginning, climax and end. it is more like a documentary with only beginning and climax with very very very exciting plot that makes it may be the first horror documentary ever.PS: it is lovely film but not really everybody cup of tea.",10,1,4,22 January 2011
Closer," it exactly dissects the human nature
","i have seen Closer yesterday unfortunately it was dubbed in German which i believe actually took a part of the glamor of the dialog but anyway i was extremely shocked by how foul the dialog was and how also extremely brilliant in the same time, it exactly capture the inside of the human nature showing us how people can hurt and destroy each other in the name of love while the true motives are anything but love, i mean it is just the old fashioned motives of wanting to have what does not belong to you, power and controlfirst of all lets see the 4 characters we have in this movie (all were performed exquisitely)1- Anna: she represent the hysterical superficial women (which let us face it represent most of the women of our time now).. she suppose to be an artist with a vision and a point of view but actually she is extremely superficial and represent the typical hysterical personality of being unstable changing and moving always from one lover to another not knowing what she actually wants she falls out and in love with Dann and Larry just like you would change your tie not because she actually loves them but she loves the fact that they are fighting for her keep her always in the center of attention.2- Dann: the superficial man with one thing in mind and thats of course sex (which lets face it that actually represents most of the men of our time)he just took one look at Alivce falls in love with her and then he took one look to Ann and he simply also falls in love with her and i am sure that if he says another women within the next month he will also falls in love with her and it has nothing to do with love it is the fact that most men when they just see any pretty women their sup conscience acts in a way to disguise their sexual impulses towards this women as love impulses (old facts of life).3- Larry: he is the intelligent deep vicious person , he understand the people around him and manipulate them as much as he wants he knows how to get what he wants and he is Igo is the only thing that motivate him to fight for Anna while Love would be counted one of the least motives in his glorious war to win Anna back i think Larry is those kind of people who are in love with themselves more then anything else and they can not live to the fact that any one else has him them in any thing specially when the object of dispute is actually his wife.4- Alice : represent the intelligent deep good person in the group she is almost the angel between them (except for the fact that she is a striper otherwise she would be to perfect to be human .. i guess): she really understand the people around her not trying to use or abuse anyone on the contrary she ended up being abused and hurt by everyone (lets face it these kind of people don't exist any more)i think the human range would not be really so different from this kind of people my advice to you open your eyes very wide next time you fall in love which one of this 4 people you will be falling in love with.. i think this is the good warning we can get out of that movie",Null,1,2,20 January 2005
