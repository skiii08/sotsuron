Requiem for a Dream," Spectacular
","Ranks among the best 3 movies I've ever seen (the other two being American Beauty and The Matrix).  I have never seen a movie that elicited such a powerful emotional response from me--this is the only movie I have ever cried during.  A stunning job with camera techniques, symbolism, and simply giving the movie a 'real' feeling. >",10,0,1,11 December 2001
