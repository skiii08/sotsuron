The Hangover," Hilarious
","After Todd Phillips rather disappointing debut in this genre of low-brow comedy, 2003's 'Old School' not many people would be expecting a lot from 'The Hangover'. How refreshing therefore that despite taking a tried and tested formula, 'The Hangover' manages to be consistently funny and emerges as a strong contender for the funniest film of the last few years.Focusing upon husband to be Doug (Justin Bartha) the film begins with his three best friends; Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Phil (Bradley Cooper)waking up in Vegas the morning after their friends stag night, only to find there mate has gone missing. What adds particular kudos to Phillip's film is that unlike most films in this genre we are spared the pre-amble of the drunken night itself and instead have no further clue than the characters themselves, only piecing together the previous nights evidence as we go along. Finding a baby in the closet of there hotel room, Mike Tyson's tiger in the bathroom and one of the main characters missing a front tooth are just some of the bizarre clues we are given at the beginning.Another problem with most films in this genre is you see the sixty second trailer, laugh hysterically, only to go and watch the film to find all the funny bits were within the trailer. Not so with 'The Hangover', with the laughs coming thick and fast; from Mike Tyson's cameo to the guys finding a naked Asian man in the trunk of there car, the film really does have it all! If I had to pick one thing that I think makes the film the success it is however, it would be the chemistry between the main leads. You really do care about the situations they find themselves in and that the ending is a happy one. You have Phil the alpha-male, Stu the neurotic nerd who gets everything wrong and the hilariously weird, bearded Alan. It is arguably Galifianakis role as him that his the star role, watch out for the hysterical moment when Mike Tyson knocks him out singing along to Phil Collins. In conclusion this film is hilarious and also features one of the best credit sequences ever when the guys find a camera after Doug's wedding that explains everything unanswered up to that point.",9,1,2,22 March 2010
12 Angry Men," Brilliant In It's Simplicity
","Forty three years since the release of Sidney Lumet's debut, in a current cinematic age where films seem increasingly judged on the strength of their special effects or CGI, how refreshing it is that 12 Angry Men can still be considered a masterpiece.On the face of it selling the premise of 12 Angry Men is no easy feat. The film focuses on the jury in the case of a young man facing the death penalty for the murder of his father. However, what's different is that 12 Angry Men is set almost entirely within a single, unremarkable room, as the twelve jurors try to reach a unanimous verdict.Featuring such cinematic greats as Joseph Walden, Lee J. Cobb and the superb Henry Fonda the film relies purely on an excellent screenplay, fantastic dialogue and consistently excellent character development as the various prejudices of the twelve jurors are revealed. Because of unspectacular setting there is a fantastic feeling of claustrophobic suspense that dominates throughout Beginning with 11 jurors convinced the man is guilty, only Henry Fonda's character expresses any doubts. As the film plays out various ballots are taken where the characters give their verdict and increasingly Fonda's character places doubt in your mind that the other juror's opinions are clouded. In the history of film there are very few directors who could capture the suspense that Lumet generates from such a shabby, sparse setting, for instance each time the men take a ballot and it is revealed more and more of the jury have their doubts.Compared to the stunt filled, special effects marathons that seem to dominate our screens today, 12 Angry Men still stands out as a ray of light that proves beyond doubt that excellent dialogue, screenplay and acting talent wins out on CGI any day.",9,0,0,20 September 2010
500 Days of Summer," 500 Days Of Sublime Summer
","On the face of it 500 Days of Summer is just another 'rom-com'. Another boy meets girl, falls in love..you know the rest. Yet, as the film begins, 'you should know this is not a love story', you realise 500 Days of Summer is so much more and in my opinion one of the best films of the last couple of years.As with most of the best films the concept is hardly rocket science. To sum it up the film follows Tom Hanson (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his on/off relationship with Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel)over a period of 500 days. Yet whilst the majority of 'rom coms' these days seem to seek their laughs from placing there characters in a series of increasingly fantastical situations, it is the sheer mundaneness of the situations Tom and Summer find themselves in that really makes this film work. For instance a shopping trip to Ikea, a visit to a modern art exhibition or just the sheer fact they met in the bland environment of the workplace.Both Gordon-Levitt are and Deschanel are excellent in there roles and it is hard to imagine anyone else playing there characters. However what elevates the film from 'good' to 'great' is the way it is still able to pack an emotional punch, grounding the characters in a sense of reality. Because the scenes are spliced together, almost like random snippets of conversation in a diary, it allows the director to follow up scenes of happiness and joy with ones of angst and heartbreak, making it gloriously unpredictable and just like the ups and downs of real life.If you are looking for any flaws you could argue the ending is a little below par, not quite as quirky or original as the previous 90 minutes, but this is a minor blemish on an otherwise fantastic picture. It is also worth pointing out the music of the Smiths, Regina Spektor consistently fits perfectly and I challenge anyone not to want to tap there feet when we get Tom's big dance number after his first date with Summer.",9,0,1,1 September 2010
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Mostly Goes Down Smooth
","'Anchorman', set in San Diego, tells the story of lead anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) as he struggles to come to terms with the concept of sexual equality within the work place when Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) joins his local network. The film is very much a parody of 1970's local news anchors with an array of increasingly garish suits and facial hair indicating a strong emphasis on appearance, no matter how terrible the news. For instance in one scene involving a fight between several news teams there is just one rule, 'No touching of hair or face'. It also seems to indicate that the 1970's was a rather dull decade for news reporting with water skiing squirrels and a pregnant panda two of the biggest leads!If you like your comedies big on character development and complex narrative, Anchorman is not for you. Whilst it does touch upon themes of gender inequality in a profession that was just coming to terms with the concept of women as 'anchorwomen', you do get the impression this is merely a sideshow for the gags and hence for the most part the film has almost zero depth. When Burgundy replies 'that doesn't make sense' in relation to one of the movies most quoted lines about the Sex Panter cologne '60% of the time it works every time' you know where he's coming from as must of the hundred or so one liners in this film ('Saint Damien's Beard!', Great Odin's Raven') will leave you scratching your head at the sheer absurdity of it all. Yet at the same time they are so off the cuff as to be equally brilliant and instantly remind you of classics such as 'Airplane!' or 'The Naked Gun' that were packed with so many verbal gags that a lack of story was irrelevant.In fact, when the film begins and the credits reveal that this film was written by Will Ferrell himself you begin to wonder how much of the film was improvised as they went along. Whilst the humour can be crude('Why don't you go back to your home on Whore Island', 'Mr Burgundy you have a massive erection')it never steps over the line into gross out comedy. It is a testament to Ferrell that despite the fact that Ron Burgundy is one of the most self centred, sexist characters in film you find yourself strangely warming to him. Equally excellent is his co star Christina Applegate as his rival for lead anchor. There are also strong performances from the rest of Burgundy's team, for instance Paul Rudd as reporter in the field Brian Fantana and the intellectually challenged Brick Tamland played by Steve Carrell ('years later doctors will tell me I have an IQ of 48').Whilst it is refreshing to see a comedy that provides consistent laughs throughout its duration it is perhaps fair to say in the main these are moderate rather than side-splitting. Also, whilst the fight scene between rival news crews is amusing it does seem little more than a who's who with cameos from Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller etc. It is perhaps fair to say that the material is at its funniest when it is closer to the bone in parodying the 'anchorman' of the 1970's. Despite this, this is still one of the best comedies of recent years and if you watch it without asking too many probing questions it appears nothing but a much of people having fun? And what's wrong with that? For in the main, as Ron Burgundy says 'it goes down smooth'.",8,1,1,10 January 2010
The Birds," Genuinely Terrifying!
","Consider for a second some of the incredible films Alfred Hitchcock has directed; Rear Window, Psycho, Vertigo to name just a few. It is therefore saying something that in my opinion 'The Birds' is the directors greatest accomplishment.The film, based in California, focuses on a mass outbreak of bird attacks against the residents of Bodega Bay with its main characters the macho Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and a rich 'it girl' of the time, Melanie Daneils (Tippi Hedren). Its perhaps fair to say that if you aren't a fan of leaving questions unanswered in a film this may not be for you. We are never presented with any answers as to just why these birds are choosing to seemingly wage war with humanity, yet in a way this is what makes the film so haunting.As a fan of the horror genre too many films tend to fall in to the trap of displaying frequent over the top gore as a way of providing the shock factor. Whilst 'The Birds' does provide genuine gore, in one scene Brenner's mother travels to a friends farmhouse to find the birds have laid siege to the house and pecked the mans eyes clean out, it is the eerie silences when the birds are gathering and the excellent POV shots that help build suspense, meaning when the shocks do come they are genuinely terrifying!Indeed when Melanie is waiting outside the school and the birds are gathering in silence on the climbing friend behind or when she climbs up to the attic with nothing but torch light.Another thing modern day horror tends to fall into the trap of his underestimating the sheer terror of pure silence. There is no music in 'The Birds' meaning when they do attack all we hear is the shrill sound of the bird calls and the flapping of their wings. Believe me, its a haunting sound! You also cannot underestimate the role the characters play in this film, they are real people who you genuinely care what happens to them. Taylor and Hedren are both excellent but it is arguably Mitch's mother, Jessica Tandy who is the cream of the crop as a character petrified of being left alone. Note her haunting reactions as the camera provides to sudden close up shots after she discovers her friends eyes have been picked out! It may be some 47 years since the release of 'The Birds' yet you would have a very tough time to find many films that can be as genuinely haunting. It is a Hitchcock must see!",9,1,2,4 April 2010
