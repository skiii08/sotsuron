Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Less action, no less quality
","Some Spoilers Within!Much has been said that Vol. 2 is nowhere near the quality of Vol. 1, but it is far from true.What is true, it that it is very much a different film. Less action yes, but with it we get more depth. You still get your action scenes, the battle with Elle Driver has to be the standout, and ends in a very satisfying conclusion.The big dramatic scene of the burial is also gripping, and really needs to be appreciated at the cinema, rather than at home.I have also seen criticism of the amount of talk in the film, but when the words are those of Tarantino, surely this is unfair. The actors do a superb job with the material in most cases. Uma Thurman the standout in every scene she appears, with the possible exception of Chia Hui Liu as Pai Mei, who is nothing short of superb. Speaking as a UK viewer, the one thing that was grim for me, was the acting and script for the Bride's daughter. Attack of the sickly 'Spielberg' child, if ever I saw one!Overall though, an excellent experience. Perhaps a little long in places, and the final killing of Bill, although maybe appropriate, may be short of the blood lust some may have craved.Well worth the viewing, whatever kind of film fan you are. 9/10.",9,0,1,29 April 2004
Saving Private Ryan," Without doubt the most realistic war film ever
","From the outset it is without doubt the most realistic war film ever made. The stomach churning beach battle at the beginning may well have put many off, but those that stopped with it were rewarded by superb acting, and more especially Steven Spielberg's staggering direction. A must see film, if ever there was one.",10,2,4,4 March 2000
