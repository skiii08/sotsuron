The Ring," A reasonable attempt at old style horror
","This was not a bad film. A reasonable attempt at old style horror. It does the right thing in implying  that there is something nasty out  there. That has always been more effective than gore, slash and gross-out. But too many things are left unexplained or not explained enough. The acting was adequate. Even Brian Cox, who is usually excellent, didn't have much to do. Did I see him in the mourning party at the beginning of the film? And if he was there, why?. But the mood and the look of the film did make it better than average. I haven't seen the japanese original and I must look out for it.",Null,0,0,23 November 2002
28 Days Later...," Not a Zombie film
","This is certainly worth seeing despite some flaws. But it is not a zombie film. The 'zombie' characteristics come about because of a fatal infection, they are not the undead. The sequences in a deserted London are superb. The use of silence is extremely effective. I note in the credits a thanks to the traffic marshalls of London for making it come about. I thought Cillian Murphy was ok as the hero but far better was Naomi Harris as the female survivor. She really made something of her character and I hope we see her again. Christopher Eccleston is always good but there really wasn't enough depth in the characterisations of the soldiers. It's a cliche that when civilisation ends, the brutish are in charge. They probably would be, at least in the beginning; civilised behaviour is a bit of an oxymoron when there is no civilisation. But overall it is good film and well worth the money. The so called alternative ending, after the credits, is really not worth staying for. Danny Boyle could have finished it effectively using either of the endings, it wasn't necessary to have two.",Null,0,0,6 September 2003
Identity," Good old fashioned suspense
","This is a highly enjoyable film. Not a particularly original plot but it is made in such an effective way with good suspense. The heralded  twist in the plot is not that difficult to work out, I didn't get it exactly as the story panned it but the gist of it was not too difficult to work out. What made it work was the use of sound and music. It did build up superb tension. 7 out of 10 for me.",Null,0,0,2 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best fantasy film ever
","A very satisfying end to the best fantasy film ever. Reading through other reviews here and elsewhere I get annoyed with the little purists screaming 'it's not the same as the book'. Why the hell should it be.The book was magnificent. I've read it several times. This is Peter Jacksons and his teams interpretation of the book and it is excellent. The opposite comments were made of the Harry Potter movies, that they remained too close to the books. So obviously the directors can't win which ever way they go.Back to Middle Earth - I don't think you can say one episode was better than the other. As another reviewer said elsewhere, by being planned as one film in three parts it avoided  the pitfalls of sequelitis. The CG images while superb did not takeover from the characters and the story. That's why it is so successful. The Story remained  the strongest element. Performances were all good but if Sean Astin does not get best supporting actor there is no justice in the world. I even liked the multiple endings, I know many critics have carped on  those. But not me,   I enjoyed all the ends being tied up. Come on Peter - Please make 'The Hobbitt'.",Null,0,0,27 December 2003
