Walk the Line," Excellent sums it up
","I was expecting this movie to be very good, but it by far exceeded my expectations. The acting was sensational, and the music was incredible. It was even better considering that both Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash's music was actually performed by their prospective actors. Truly breath taking, even if you are not a big Johnny Cash fan. This movie diverges into the personal turmoils of Cash and Carter, and draws the audience into the ups and down, which, helps draw them together. It binds heartache, divorce, guilt, family issues, love, and music together into a beautiful collage of genuine, heartfelt energy. It was remarkable, and worth every bit of hype it received.",10,4,10,18 November 2005
