The Blair Witch Project," Wonderful film making!
","This was truly one of the best horror movies that I have ever seen. The best part to me and which most people hate about it was the way you never saw what was doing it.  I was just like in really life were you don't always know what is chasing you or after you.  The movie attacked all your senses it made you laugh, cry and even at the right point jump out of your skin.  This movie was like another I have seen called Cannibal Holocaust (I don't recommend this won to the faint or strong on heart) were they find the film of the lost film crew and see what really happened to them.  Both movies caused alot of people to think that they are real and not just a movie which I liked about them because they do look really and do make you wonder.  They movie makers are very smart in that they integrated the Internet with the movie (blairwitch.com).  If you saw just the movie you may wonder about the legend of the Blair Witch or what happened after or before and the Internet site tells you just that and also makes the movie seem all the more real.  After I went to the Internet site(yes I went there after the movie) the movie seemed alot scarier.  I would advise anyone to watch this wonderful movie and if you don't appreciate look at the web site because it makes it much better trust me.",6,2,3,30 August 1999
