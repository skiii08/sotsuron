","Written by George Lucas and directed by Steven Spielberg, Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first of the classic Indiana Jones series, is a story about a man, Indiana, who is hired by the government to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do.  The Ark holds the original Ten Commandments. Jones is an archaeologist and adventurer.  He teaches by day, but when an adventure comes along, he will stop at nothing to get his treasure. Indiana is portrayed as a near completely fearless leader with merely one fear: snakes.  As he goes about his journey to retrieve the Ark, Indiana braves nearly impossible challenges.  However he is always either aware of the traps set for him, or somehow lucks out when he falls into them.  The main catch of this movie, as well as the rest in the trilogy, is the awesome suspense, keeping the audience's attention at all times.  The suspense is kept by placing Jones in ridiculous situations in which he always manages to narrowly get out of.  For example, in the beginning of the movie Indiana finds himself fleeing the cave from numerous traps.  At on point he is hanging from a ledge while a door begins to seal shut nearby.  The door closes almost all the way and Indiana is still hanging.  It looks as if there is no way he will get up in time, but of course, he makes it just in time to slide under the door and reach back under to retrieve his whip and pull out from under the very second it seals shut.  Just after that, in one of the most memorable scenes of the movie, he finds himself being followed by an enormous boulder getting closer and closer with every step.  In this scene, he manages to fall into a hole as the boulder rolls over, leaving him unharmed.  He falls through the whole into more trouble, but still managed to escape the inescapable.  These types of situations continue throughout the duration of the film.  Though the outcomes of the situations are rather predictable, they never seem to get old or boring.  Know-it-all, fearless, confident Indiana Jones keeps suspense high in every way, at all times, making this and the rest of the series classic films.",Null,0,0,13 May 2003

","Directed by Rob Reiner, This is Spinal Tap is a `rock'umentary of the fictional European heavy metal band Spinal Tap.  The film pokes fun at the numerous stereotypes of heavy metal `hair bands'.  Dubbed as the world's loudest band, with amplifiers set to 11, Spinal Tap embarks on their first U.S. tour in years.  During this period Marti DeBergi follows the band making his documentary.  The scenes throughout the movie vary from interviews and concerts with the band, to the backstage and offstage life of its members.  The band was formed by guitarists and vocalists David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel.  Oddly, they began as an upbeat pop band, which is portrayed as a Beatles-like group.  They eventually decided to take on the genre of rock and roll and, after many name changes, settled on the name Spinal Tap.  The film makes fun of the ever-changing lineups of modern rock groups, having all of Spinal Tap's past drummers need to be replaced due to odd deaths such as a freak gardening accident, choking on vomit, and on stage spontaneous combustion.  During scenes of concert footage of the band, we are treated to their satirical lyrics of songs such as Big Bottom, Hell Hole, and Sex Farm Woman.  In a likely not too far off exaggeration of real rock bands, Spinal Tap argues constantly about practically everything.  At one point manager Ian Faith quits after a long argument with the band and David's girlfriend over the miniature Stonehenge prop on stage.  During a concert soon to follow, Nigel walks off and quits in the middle of the show. Eventually the band reforms for its tour in Japan, but ultimately stays on its downhill path.  The satire and realistic feel to this film makes it a classic comedy.",Null,0,2,14 May 2003
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Contains spoilers! Monty Python and the Holy Grail...
","Contains spoilers! Monty Python and the Holy Grail, directed by Terry Gilliam in 1975, is a story set in 932 AD.  Gilliam used the off-the-wall humor that is the staple of the Monty Python films and shows.  It follows British King Arthur as he searches for knights to join him at the round table in Camelot.  The film begins with Arthur coming into the scene on what sounds like his horse. We soon find out that he has a companion merely clicking coconut shells together to make the sound; we see this throughout the movie.  Eventually Arthur finds a knight and asks him to join his party.  But the knight refuses, and also denies Arthur passage through the forest.  A classic battle ensues with Arthur dismembering the knight leaving it only its torso and head.  Comically, the knight is not dead and continues to bad mouth Arthur as he rides off.  Along the way he does finally acquire a group of knights, most notably Sir Launcelot, Sir Galahad, and Sir Robin.  As they venture to Camelot they receive a quest from God: to find the Holy Grail. They split up and each head on their separate searches for the grail. Each group encounters many strange challenges along the way.  The `brave' Sir Robin, most notable for being a coward, is accompanied by his minstrels. They sing praise of his bravery along the way until the finally come about a three-headed knight.  They eventually sneak away while the three head are bickering.  The minstrels continue to sing; only now about his cowardly fleeing of the knight.  During Sir Galahad's search, he sees an image of a grail flashing above a castle.  He runs to the castle to find it occupied with sex-deprived women, but no grail.  Just as Galahad is happily about to engage in various acts with the women, Launcelot comes and takes him away, thinking that he's saving Galahad.  Next, Arthur's clan encounters the Knights of Ni.  The Knights of Ni are tall creatures with masks in all black whose vile attack is saying `ni' to passers.  They request Arthur find them a shrubbery.  When Arthur returns with the shrub, they request another one as well as ask them to `cut down the mightiest tree in the forest with a herring.'  Arthur is saved when Robin stumbles along and they begin to talk. Robin uses the word `it' at sometime, which happens to be the Knight's weak point. Many other odd encounters occur along the way to their unsuccessful quest for the Grail.  All of which are equally ridiculous as the ones I described. The whole crew of Monty Python does a wonderful job using their outlandish senses of humor to make this one of the most hilarious movies of all time.",Null,1,1,13 May 2003
