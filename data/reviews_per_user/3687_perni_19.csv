The Blair Witch Project," Still manages to scare me to the bones...
","I saw this movie for the first time in the 'perfect' environment. It was on Showtime, with no commercials, and it played at night. Then, as it was very late by the time it was finished, I actually had to go to bed without seeing anything that could cheer up my subconscious. The result? A good case of insomnia where everything looked like an inky black shroud with two unblinking white eyes. Holy macrap I was scared after watching this thing. And it still manages to send shivers down my spine. If you haven't seen this yet (and if so, what is wrong with you?), the entire thing is shot with a home movie camera and centers around 3 college students who get lost in the woods and never come back. Some complain about the shaky camera, but I loved it. It seemed much more natural than any stolid Hollywood camera. And I understand how some might not like this movie, since in the end you never get a good look at the horror that is the Blair Witch and there are no special effects or fancy CGI to speak of. But as for me, I didn't need those things to have a good time. The little things that replaced the whizz-pow effects did the job: the tiny hands on the campers' tent, the hundreds of stick figures wafting in the breeze, and a bushel of teeth and a tongue. That's all the movie had to give me to sufficiently screw up my head. Maybe that is why I didn't like the sequel so much, as it actually was a Hollywood flick that resorted to graphic violence and stupid images of people eating owls (spooky, really) to shock its audience. As for the original, it gets a perfect score of 4/4. Oh, and don't bother to watch this on FX or any other TV channel if you really want to get the full effect. Commercials break up the tension every 5 minutes, and you will be disappointed. Instead, rent this, sit at home by yourself in the dark with only a blanket to protect you, and try not to get spooked.'I'm afraid to close my eyes...I'm afraid to open them...(gasps)...what was that? Oh my God...'",Null,0,1,4 November 2002
The Ring," Just as creepy as The Blair Witch Project
","Wow, talk about a movie where you want to cover your face half the time because of the insane pyscho crap happening on the screen. The Ring has one of those great moody plots that is never resolved and is filled to the brim with dark images, shriek-inducing scares, and almost no time to breathe. It revolves around a reporter who investigates a VHS tape that kills anyone who watches it after 7 days prior to the viewing. The actual tape makes no sense the first time you watch it in the movie, with avant-garde shots of a ladder, a woman brushing her hair in a mirror, and much more. But as the mystery unfolds everything starts to fall into place, but will our heroine have time to uncover the biggest secret of all before her 7 days run out? Tension is raised with some help from a 'cinema cooking timer' of sorts that tells you how many days she has left. The only thing I have to say about this movie, and it isn't really negative, is that it tries to be a lot like The Sixth Sense. Think about it. It has a somber, depressed tone where everything is a dark black or blue, an eerie little boy who hears voices, and an ending that tries to be shocking by revealing the clues we might have missed. I think The Sixth Sense definitely had a better ending, since The Ring confused me somewhat before the credits finally rolled, but it still succeeded in making me think twice about shadows in the corner or strange sights at the corner of my eye. It doesn't take much to creep me out, and The Ring sufficiently scared the bejeezus out of me. I give it 4/4 stars.",Null,0,0,4 November 2002
Minority Report," Nice flavor, with nothing to chew on
","First off, Minority Report won't change how you view the world or anything like that. It's simply a well tailored mystery with eye-popping effects, much like Spielberg's A.I. The action sequences struck me as similar to those in Star Wars: Episode II, from the scene where Cruise hangs on to flying cars to the one where he's in a factory and avoids machinery while fighting. The futuristic touches really impressed me, but the fact that in 2054 we still have The Gap and Aquafina was also funny. The comedic touches, while odd, were not so jarring that it ruined the picture. Be warned that the plot is extremely complicated. DO NOT go to the bathroom or get more popcorn if you don't want to miss something. And if you DO wet your whistle, DON'T bug the person next to you about the scene you just missed. It's annoying, okay? Again, if you see something like Men In Black II and then see Minority Report, it requires a total change of mind-set. To conclude, here are some thoughts (SPOILERS): 1. In one scene, Cruise injects something into his neck and his face totally changes. I did not get the point of this, since I never saw how that helped him get inside Precrime Headquarters.2. Why are the victims and perpetrators of precrime written out on little wooden balls? It is the year 2054, isn't it?3. The ending seemed too happy after everything that came before it. ALL of the characters end up healthy and content? I'm thinking that Spielberg didn't want to bum anyone out...So if you can stand hours of techno babble and like to follow mysteries (Jinkies!), then see Minority Report. 3 out of 4 stars.",Null,0,0,17 July 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Good, but does it deserve the insane amount of hype?
","Before I begin I would like to ask what the heck 'tedg' was talking about in his posting for this film. He/She spent their entire review talking about camera positions and then had the odd idea of putting the phrase 'Spoilers herein' at the start of the message. What exactly did you ruin, tedg, the camera angles? And why did you compare this film to 12 Monkeys and Panic Room? How are those movies similar in any way in which you could compare and contrast them? And how exactly does one 'steal' another person's camera trick? That's like someone doing a donut in their car and then being accused of stealing the maneuver from the original creator, Daryll Dwebster Donut. News flash: you can't get a patent on a camera trick. Maybe a camera, yes, but not a trick! If you feel like explaining yourself, e-mail me . Title the e-mail, 'tedg's reasoning on his/her PotC:CotBP review.'Sorry, just felt like rambling there for a second. Now, on to the review! While I enjoy this film quite a lot, I have to question why everyone went stark raving mad over its arrival. Sure, I have no problem saying that Pirates is a very entertaining swashbuckler, but does it really need to be on a critic's Top 10 list this year? The film may be of good quality, but there are other, better movies out there which may need the acclaim. I'm not saying my opinion is definite, mind you, but just putting it out there for debate reasons.Johnny Depp's performance is excellent, I'll give him that, what with his flamboyant interpretation of the character giving the film a big spark, but everyone on the planet has discussed him to the point where anything I say will be moot. So as for the rest of the film, I give it a definite thumbs up. The plot is well developed, the characters are appealing and believable, and I liked the gradual progression to the film's big climactic ending. However, I felt at times like it was almost too long. The recent Lord of the Rings flew by pretty quickly for me, but for some reason this film seemed to drag at certain points, as in where Jack Sparrow and the female main character get stuck on an island together. This isn't a major complaint, however, and I guess it shows how Disney was allowing the film room to grow.All in all I think it's a very refreshing change for Disney to release a film like this. With a PG-13 rating which comes with boatloads of action and mild-violence, Pirates gives the usually squeaky clean image of Disney a nice dark side. Hopefully the sequel won't disappoint, and Disney won't force the filmmakers to dilute the action so that more kids will come to watch. I would hate to watch a dumbed down pirate movie with a PG rating, as it would just feel wrong.Cutthroat Island this ain't; a great pirate film which champions the genre back to respectability after many major flops. 3/4 stars",Null,0,1,31 December 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Hilarious Social Commentary
","I've always liked South Park the television show for its amazing social commentary, and for the movie it seems that the creators have not held back for a second. EVERYONE gets bashed, from the flappy-headed, beady- eyed Canadians to the U.S. military and especially the parents who are quick to protest anything that might 'corrupt' their kids instead of, I don't know, being an actual parent. What's great about the movie is that it's a musical, and a good one at that. I have most of the songs on my computer, and while they're very short (most don't run over two minutes in length), most do a good job of riffing 'real' musicals. If you know anything about Disney, then you'd catch the little references to Beauty & the Beast in the opening Mountain Town song, and Satan's Up There ballad reminded me of Part of Your World from The Little Mermaid. Some of the songs are great just by themselves, like the Oscar-nominated (I kid you not) Blame Canada or the swear-ridden It's Easy MMMkay. The story's pretty silly (something about Armageddon coming to pass if Terrance & Phillip are executed), but it's only there to set up the constant jokes, riffs, and gags. It's hard coming up with my favorite moment, but I especially liked when the Mole grabbed one of the kids and said something like, 'What do you think this is, some kind of Saturday kiddie show where we all sit around and lick Barney's big purple pussy?' He cursed God a minute later, calling him a bitch, and that probably falls in at second place. If you like the show, then you will absoultely be floored by the movie. 4 out of 4 stars!",Null,0,0,27 June 2002
Dead Poets Society," Ridiculously dramatic
","I can see why Roger Ebert would include this in his book of most reviled movies. Overall it just seemed really unrealistic and oozes with sentimentality to the point of nausea. Now don't get me wrong, Robin Williams is a great comedian, but his socially aware movies like this one and Patch Adams (which, if you think about it, are extremely similar) tend to make me gag. Also, why is every adult in this movie besides Williams 100% pure eeeeevil? The rest of the faculty at the prep school, every parent, even the janitors are these horribly bitter, mean souls who have nothing better to do than scowl at the screen. It's just a wee bit one-sided, is all I'm saying. And I found it hard to sympathize with Williams' character because his peers actually made some good points. Sure, it's one thing to encourage your students, but at a certain point things can get out of hand. Now comes my big speech about the main plot point: Neil's suicide. I had NO IDEA this was coming at me when I saw this character putting on his Shakespearean crown of thorns and walking to his dad's office. My classmates and I joked about him possibly axing his father (who had forbidden him to become an actor because he is eeevil), or axing himself, but we didn't think it would actually happen. And I just laughed out loud at the father's reaction to seeing his son and how the director handled it. Hint, it's in slow motion and he screams, 'Noooooooooo!' Very cheesy. Then there is the ending, where Williams gets fired, half of the students get expelled, and the audience is supposed to believe that standing on your desks fixes everything. Sorry, but your teacher is still fired kids, and guess what? Now you have detention for standing on the desks! All in all, a sappy melodrama that lasted way too long, with about 100 lackluster subplots and too many characters. 1/4 stars",Null,3,7,14 May 2003
Blade II," Gross beyond belief (but still cool)!
","I thought the parts of the first Blade I saw were pretty cheesy, since the ending was filled with fake computer effects and sported a skinny villain who looked like he needed a tan. But the budget for Blade II is obviously much higher, so now we get insanely cool Reaper vampires who can suck the fluids out of you with their bowling ball-sized tongues and fight sequences that defy imagination. Sure there are the usual questions about the loose plot, but since you'll never get answers it is better to just sit back and watch the body count rise. I dug Blade as the hero, with his silver bullet uzi and Batmanish attitude towards others, the Blood Pack team (sheesh, even the name Blood Pack is cool by itself!), and especially that creepy, 1,000-year-old vampire who wants to breed invincible Dracula warriors (oops, spoiler!). There are one or two nice twists that I didn't see coming and again, the fighting is just as good as anything you'll see in The Matrix, if not better. Of course we get that one token slow-mo shot where the camera pans around the combatants, but who could refuse to do a shot like that in their action movie? Hopefully when the second Matrix movie comes out it will have something fresh for everyone to rip-off. Be warned, though, that this is a very gross movie, filled with exploding bodies, scenes of vampiric autopsy, gooey brains and much more, so the squeamish would definitely want to stay away from Blade II. Other than that, comic book fans and lovers of action should adore this movie. ***/****",Null,0,1,11 October 2002
10 Things I Hate About You," Twisted humor rises 10 above other teen comedies
","10 Things is much better for teenagers than stuff like She's All That or, yes, the American Pies or any number of their gross-out clones. It has some slick, well-written jokes and characters that are actually, oh, what's the word, interesting. And Freddy Prinze is no where to be seen. Now that's worth the price of a rental right there. I like the dark girl who won't date, her popularity-starved younger sister, the geek who wants to date the p-starved sister, the jerk model who only wants to date the p-starved sister so he can nail her (sorry, I'm not good at remembering names), but I especially enjoyed the dad who delivers babies for a living and thus becomes obsessed with protecting his girls from the outside world of hormones and condoms. I do find it odd when movies insist on having high schools be the size of castles (in 10's case, you can take that literally. They actually do learn in a mother freezin' castle!), but what ya gonna do? Also, the story is just about the same as the one from She's All That, but doesn't involve the dark girl becoming a prom queen. The characters simply just want to date one another, which makes more sense (prom queen is not necessarily a role that EVERYONE cares about and scrutinizes over in the real world). So, all in all, a good cable catcher. 3 out of 4 stars.",Null,0,0,7 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Visually amazing and a great achievement
","Okay, so there may be those who say The Lord of the Rings is for geeks who live with their Mom and debate over the smallest plot holes in Star Wars with other fellow geeks at the local comic book store. Well, the truth is that anyone who can't appreciate this movie just doesn't have the attention span to understand such a wonderfully epic story. And I have also heard complaints that this movie does not have an ending. Well of course it doesn't! It's the first in a trilogy, you dolts! As for the movie being boring, while there are some stretches of tedium, the film as a whole is wonderful. Every character, whether it be hero or villain, is well-acted and brought to life with craft. Who would have thought that Elijah Wood (star of Flipper and The Faculty, mind you), would make such a good Frodo? I should probably say right now that I have not read any of the books, which I see as a plus. The big problem I have with watching the Harry Potter movies is that I already know what is going to happen, so they are not as fun as the Lord of the Rings. With this trilogy, everything is fresh and surprising. I dug the immense amount of CGI and other types of special effects, but the more traditional costumes and insanely realistic makeup was also impressive. I say that directors should incorporate more traditional effects like puppetry and animatronics into their films as opposed to computer-made effects. Yes, yes, the CGI costs less and is easy to produce, but then everyone complains about how 'CG' something looks. The only thing I can see Peter Jackson having to use so much were the green screen effects, since most of the sets would be far too expensive to make in a studio or soundstage. Anyway, to wrap up, this may be a little long for some people (especially in a theater, where afterwards my entire body ached), but if you enjoy swords and sorcerey epics laden with battles, other languages, and fearsome monsters beyond imagination, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a good choice. I would buy it instead of renting it, since it is that impressive. Can't wait to see the next installment, The Two Towers, soon! 4/4 stars",Null,0,0,19 December 2002
Lilo & Stitch," The best Disney feature in years...see it!
","After watching Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I thought that Disney was caput on the traditional animation front. The entire thing felt like a huge waste of time, all because Disney didn't go that extra mile and make it completely different from its past features. It still had dumb, 'wacky' characters that were more annoying than funny, and any hopes of a mature story were overshadowed by their jokes. Thankfully, Lilo & Stitch rejuvenated my wearied soul. The writing is insanely inventive and funny, but the movie also made me choke back the tears with its endearing characters, especially the Lilo-Nani pair. You could really feel that they were sisters in a bad situation. I also love the Stitch character, just because the animation brings so much life to him even though he doesn't speak English for much of the film. Jumba and his skinny sidekick (can't remember that guy's name, but he was voiced by one of the Kids in Hall actors) were also quite funny, Jumba being more so because I loved his accent and roly-poly animation. You also have to give credit to Disney for not putting any real bad guys in this thing. In past Mouse movies, there is the BAD GUY and the GOOD GUY. If you were the BAD GUY, then you are pure, Satanic evil. If you were the GOOD GUY, you have no character flaws and are basically Jesus. Here, the 'bad' characters do good things, and the 'good' characters make mistakes. You know, like in real life. Duh! Of all the characters Lilo is probably my favorite, since she's so out there and weird. I think all kids can relate to her being stranded by the other girls, since every kid is weird in his/her own way. So, to say the least, Lilo is the best film of the summer for adults AND kids. Yes, its so touching and funny that both groups should love it. I give this teddy bear of a film 4 out of 4 stars.",Null,1,1,23 June 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Best Disney Flick In Years
","Atlantis: The Lost Empire sucked. There, I said it. Lilo and Stitch, however, is definitely not in the same ballfield. It sports some great animation ideas (check out those watercolor backgrounds...very 'toon retro), a well-written script with endearing characters, and some very hummable tunes, ranging from classic Elvis to the A*Teens, who I have always enjoyed. Stitch is a fabulous character due to his fuzzy-wuzzy appearance that's matched with his fiery personality. The whole model of San Francisco gag was hilarious, and showed just how offbeat the blue alien is. I also really liked the relationship between Lilo and her older sister Nani. Very believeable and, more importantly, touching. I seriously teared up during this film at times, something that very rarely happens with me. I give L&S 4 out of 4 stars, since it is the best animated film out there right now (with Powerpuff Girls being a late second). Too bad the previews I saw stunk up the joint. Hey Arnold? The Country Bears? Puh-lease! The only one I enjoyed was the visually stunning Treasure Planet. That flick looks fantastic!",Null,1,1,7 July 2002
American Beauty," Odd, twisted, sick, and oddly fascinating
","This is the first 'real' movie I'm reviewing. All of my other writings on this site have been for MST3K B-movies or animated films. American Beauty, however, was Oscar-nominated and heralded by many critics, so I take this task a little more seriously. Like I said, this is one dark and twisted film. The whole pacakage, from the wife smacking herself in moments of hysteria to the husband who fantasizes about a high school senior, is about as weird as you can get. But if you prefer something with a little more edge in your movies, this is perfect. Every single character is worth a second look, and both the opening and closing monologues are classic (I'm going to use the opener for a theatrical audition, if that tells you anything). There are also some good comedic moments that are both sly and funny, though you may catch yourself holding back the chuckle. Again, this is some fuzzed up shoot, if I may take a note from the Superstation channel. Red is a major color in this film, from the bold roses to the door on the main character's house. I am not quite sure what its meaning is, but you can be sure I'll find out. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I certainly enjoyed the experience. Oh, and check out that ending! You knew what was going to happen from the first minute of watching, but still...4 out of 4 stars.",Null,0,0,7 July 2002
Resident Evil," Too complicated for its own good
","Resident Evil could have been better if it would have just simplified things a bit by taking out half of the 'cool' plot devices and focused more on the zombies and a little thing I like to call character devel- opment. Just trying to remember all of the babble that was thrown at me during this film gives me a headache. Let's see, there's a blue virus, a green anti-virus, some zombies that turn you into a zombie when they bite you, an extremely HAL-like computer called the Red Queen who has a holographic representation of itself that looks like the daughter of the company president, two characters who have lost their memory and have many flashbacks, a laughably bad CGI monster who gets stronger with each kill, a mansion that serves as the emergency entrance to the Hive, lasers, circuit breakers, blah blah blah. We also get a bunch of juvenile boo scares right out of a Jason movie, multiple fake-outs, and an ending that hints at a sequel. Honestly, though, the zombies were cool, and everything seemed just like the Resident Evil games (we even get shots that look like intros to the 'next level' as it were) and the scene with the lasers was satisfingly gross. However, the cast pretty much stunk, and I didn't care about any of them when they were either eaten/crushed/shot. I guess if you like the games there might be some stuff here for you, but don't expect genius here. */****",Null,0,0,8 August 2002
Blue Crush," Well cut my tail and color me flibberty-flabbled!
","Like a lot of people, I thought Blue Crush would be pretty putrid. It looked very similar to a Disney Channel Original Movie called Motocrossed, in which a girl tries to infiltrate the male-dominated sport of bike racing. I'm not saying Blue Crush ripped-off Disney. I just think it's funny that I've seen an entire DC Original Movie. Pray for me, my children. Anyway, it turns out that while light in story and character development, the stunning oceanic cinematography really saved the day here. I could watch those foaming, crushing waves all day, and some of the camera tricks were really creative. Whouda thunk? But we obviously can't spend ALL of our time out on the water, so there is a simple story here about a girl who used to be the greatest gal surfer on the beach, but after a near-drowning accident she's lost her spirit. Sound familiar, sports movie fans? She lives with two friends and her younger sister in the perfect beach bum shack, living from paycheck to paycheck by working as a maid in the nearby fancy hotel. There's a rich love interest, a sub-plot about the kid sister smoking, but none of it really goes anywhere. Everything really depends on the Big Surfing Contest at the end of the film, where if our heroine wins she will get all kinds of sponsorship and realize her dream of putting female surfing on the cover of every magazine. This inevitable showdown is really handled well, and I genuinely rooted for the girl as she tried to catch the perfect wave. My only problems revolve around the expend- able boyfriend and sister characters, who don't really do anything except spout out lines like, 'Belive in yourself. You can do it!' I say spend more time on the three lead chicks or just take the surfing footage by itself and make an IMAX film. Now that would be cool. ***/**** P.S. I loved the fat football player.

Vanilla Sky," Hmmm...Interesting, to say the least...(spoilers)
","I don't exactly know how I feel about this movie. The way it was going it seemed like Vanilla Sky was a mystery thriller of sorts, one with a big surprise ending ala The Sixth Sense. But the surprise ending I got was more A.I. than anything, and in my opinion it clashed with the rest of the film. Sorry, but I did not expect some futuristic techno ending. Sure, after watching a film like Waking Life I was all about the idea of discussing dreams, but in the end it seemed like two different films were being presented to me. I will say, however, that there are some very good performances here, from Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz to the psycho crazy Cameron Diaz (and I mean k-raazy). Also, going back to how I like dream elements, I loved the odd touches that made no sense at first. In fact, they should have been left unexplained. That's what made Waking Life work, not over analyzing everything so that the whole audience 'gets' it. Just present some weird elements, leave the ending to the viewer and let them go, 'Holy crap that was odd.' Trust me, it is much cooler that way. Maybe I might change my mind in a couple of days, but I just finished watching it and this is my fresh, raw opinion. So for a loose score, let's give VS a 2.5/4",Null,0,0,25 September 2002
Signs," Shymalan does it again!
","Sorry, but if you didn't like The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, then you are not going to enjoy Signs. All three were directed by the great new director M. Night Shymalan, and they are not your typical summer boom boom sequel clunker crap. His movies put character and story before the special effects, and move slowly so that you can get to know the cast, instead of clocking in at a quick, popcorn digesting 80 minutes. Signs, unlike Shymalan's past efforts, does not have a shocking ending that will knock your socks off, but the ride is enjoyable enough and I can understand why he didn't want to rely on that gimmick as a director. There are many moments where you just have to laugh, about twice as many that make you want to cry, and even more where you're creeped out to the point where you're pressing into the seat. Some may have a few questions about the ending, but I think there are enough clues for the audience that it all makes enough sense. The acting is pure gold, too, from Mel Gibson's reserved, cold manner to the naive, curious delivery of the two children. I especially liked Bo, the tiny girl who has about a hundred adorable lines. Mel's brother in the movie, Joquein Phoenix, also gives a nice parallel to the polite, faithless Gibson character. It is odd to see Phoenix glued to the TV screen, since it reminded me of how people must have been on 9-11, but the thought never disrupted the film. So if you like Shymalan's films, great thrillers, comedies, or just a film with a good message of faith, then go see Signs. I do not think anyone will be disappointed. ****/****",Null,0,2,6 August 2002
The Producers," Slight disappointment.
","I heard about how great this Broadway musical was, so I asked a friend to burn the sound track for me. I loved it! Besides a few tracks, every song on it is worth listening to again and again. Seeing the original movie quickly rose to the top of my To Do List, but after watching it I can't help but be disappointed. You know why? Because the movie is not a musical! How crazy is that? The only songs are Springtime For Hitler and Prisoners of Love, so apparently Mel Brooks wrote all of the other songs solely for the stage production. How dumb am I? Anyway, with that crushing blow administered, I realized how average the movie was. Sure, the lead actors are likeable, and making fun of Hitler is always a good time, but I never laughed. I wanted to laugh. I would have loved to fall off my bed in a fit of laughter. But did that happen? No! Nothing here made that key noise of amusement come out of my mouth, and that just destroyed the movie's chances with me. Now I just want to see the stage version even more. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll give this 2 out of 4 stars and pop the CD back in my stereo.",Null,0,0,24 July 2002
A Walk to Remember," Ya gotta take the good with the bad with this one...
","Okay, so I wasn't exactly chomping at the bit to see this movie. From the looks of the previews and commercials it looked like a dumb excuse for Mandy Moore to act and sing. Plus, any flick that makes girls swoon and gush at the mere mention of the title ala Titanic pretty much goes to the bottom of my must-see list. But when a trip to the Blockbuster resulted in one of the parents renting this, I figured I would take a chance and watch it one night. First the good, because that's harder to write about in a review than the bad. Mandy Moore CAN act, as it turns out, much more so than Britney Spears and Mariah Carey. She pulled off the mousey bookworm character nicely, allowing herself to look like an actual outsider, which is more than I can say for Britney when she was cast as a 'geek' but still paraded around in Banana Republic gear. The male lead, Shane West, was also decent, though kind of limited in his range of emotions. And while the central love story was a bit cliched at times, it won me over in the end. Now for the average, since upon consideration there is nothing truly bad about A Walk To Remember. I didn't like the fact that many of the scenes and characters came right out of Not Another Teen Movie. There was ONE black character, and of course he had to stay stuff like 'bomb diggity' and act all wacky, so when he went into Dramatic Mode and actually tried to show some heart I didn't buy it. His whole character up to that point was a dumb comic stereotype, so why should I bother believing his emotional scenes? And what is it with Hollywood and high schools where the cool kids are so freaking evil? See, in the real world there are social classes in high school, and there is some sort of division, but not to the point where there are plots to totally destroy someone's soul over a lover's spat. Oh wait, never mind. And like I said, with the quality romance many of the Saved By The Bell moments (like the fliers of Mandy Moore's face on a bikini-clad supermodel) seemed bizarrely out of place. All in all, though, this is a good date movie and will definitely put any mushy girl or half-way sentimental fella in Slightly Teary, Almost Crying Mode. Let's just say that if you had to pick from Glitter, Crossroads, or this for your Teen Princess Movie Night, you would be much better off going with Walk. 2.5/4 stars",Null,0,0,21 September 2002
Princess Mononoke," Very Slick Anime Epic
","I have always been interested in the field of animation, but one major chunk of the industry has alluded me for quite some time. That would be anime, a genre of animation that continues to be insanely popular in the East but widely regarded as geek-fare over here in the States. My interest rose upon hearing about Hayao Miyazaki and his wonderful films that have broken box office records in Japan. The first film I saw that was directed by him was Kiki's Delivery Service, a charming movie with a leisurely pace and appealing characters. Princess Mononoke is a very different beast, however, and is not a kid friendly fable by any means. It's a very complicated war epic that combines mythology and politics to make one amazing adult film. Sure, there is some great comic relief, but there are also decapitated soldiers, demon boars who puke buckets of blood, and characters who get shot point blank. In short, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SHOW TO THE KIDS YOU'RE BABYSITTING WHILE YOU GO AND PIG OUT ON PIZZA HOT POCKETS. The only people I see watching Princess Mononoke are mature fans of animation who can handle some gore and a deep, convoluted plot. Your basic summary of the movie's story might go something like this: A prince kills a rampaging demon that tries to attack his village, and in the process receives a deadly cures that will slowly poison his mind and body. He must now journey deep into the forest and try to find a cure, but along the way he meets a large cast of characters who are at war with one another. There's the samurai, who want the ore of Iron Town, a soft spoken warrior who guards that town, and the creatures of the forest, who are led by Princess Mononoke. At over 2 hours long, you can trust that this is just a small piece of the complete tale. The ending is a classic moment involving destruction and rebirth, and is one that cannot be missed. My favorite character had to be the Forest Spirit, a creature with bird-like legs, elk antlers, and the face of a human. I won't say anymore. Just see it, and then check out other Miyazaki flicks like Spirited Away, My Neighbor Tortoro, and Castle in the Sky. ****/****",Null,1,2,23 August 2002
