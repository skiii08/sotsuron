The Blair Witch Project," Original, creative and terrifying.
","The Blair Witch Project is one of the best horror films ever made and one of my favourite films of all time.The story is that the film is supposed to be the found footage of three young film students that head to a rural town to film a documentary about a local myth of a witch that terrorised the town many years ago. They end up getting lost in the woods while being stalked by someone or something.The film entirely shot on video and cheap, black and white film supporting the feeling that the film is found footage and it works. Something about the look of it, and given the fact that the movie was made a very low budget and there is no music, gives it a sense of realism and a unique atmosphere.The acting is great, too. All the actors are very natural and, apart from the occasional one or two cheesy line, remain consistent throughout and giving a real sense of fear to the point where you feel like you are among this group and sharing the fear with them.However, one major complaint that I have is a lot of the time the camera is shaking all way too much to really make out what exactly is going on and is literally black at some points as in you cannot see a thing which is pretty annoying but not to the point where it is unwatchable. Another minor complaint is that sometimes you cannot hear what the characters are saying due to the limited range on the microphone on the cheap cameras they used but this only occurs a couple of times and, again, is bearable.Overall, a great film and a spooky experience that you will not soon forget.",8,2,4,4 June 2013
Ed Wood," An Inspiring Story
","Ed Wood is often called one of the worst directors of all time, if not THE worst. His films suffered from laughably poor production quality, continuity errors and sub-par acting. Usually, we as the viewers, mock these flaws in films such as these but we rarely ever think about the work that was put into them or what the people behind them are like as individuals.In this film based on Ed Wood himself, follows the making of his three most infamous films, Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space and shows all the trials and troubles he had to go through to get these films made as well as his relationships with the actors, crew and in his personal life, most notably with famous horror star Bela Lugosi.Rather than make fun of Ed Wood or his work, the film instead portrays him as an ambitious young film maker who might be a little too ambitious for his own good. It's a more human look at him, almost on a personal level. Ed is played by Johnny Depp, who does a fantastic job as portraying him as both funny and sympathetic. You root for him all the way and feel his sadness and disappointment when things do not turn out as expected for him.Even though Depp acts well in the film, as do the other actors for that matter, the person who steals the show is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau plays the part to a tee and, much like Depp, plays him both funny and sympathetically only better in my opinion.The story alone is inspiring to anyone who is or was ever interested in doing something creative, especially film making. The final scene with Plan 9 playing in the theatre as Ed looks on, his face beaming with such happiness and mouthing the words he wrote and by the end he doesn't even seem to care what other people think about it but rather he is content with seeing his vision come alive.I should probably also mention that the film is not really entirely accurate to Ed Wood's real life but I feel if it was entirely accurate, the film wouldn't be as good. The only real flaw I can think of off the top of my head is that at the very end the film gives us a slide-show of all the characters and what has become of their real life counterparts and some of them are pretty sad to think about for such an uplifting movie, especially Ed himself, but that's very minor and the rest of the film is so good, I don't really mind.So, the next time you mock a film for not being up to your standards, think a little of the people behind it and the troubles they all went through to see it come to fruition. Then maybe, just a little, you can begin to appreciate film a whole lot more. I know I did after I saw Ed Wood.",9,1,1,17 August 2013
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Saga Concludes
","The epic 'Star Wars' trilogy ends with a bang.After Luke and company rescues Han from an insanely powerful gang lord in one of the greatest openings of all time, the rebellion put together their plan to defeat the Empire once and for all. Our main characters go to the forest moon of Endor to deactivate the shield generator of a second Death Star where the Emperor himself is on, giving a chance for the rebel fleet to destroy it however the Emperor has plans for Luke and wishes to make him his apprentice.The special effects and sets are, once again, fantastic. I've already praised them enough before so I won't bother repeating the same praise but expect the same attention to detail and high-quality found in the last two films. The action scenes are also very well done and epic, probably the most exciting battles in the entire series are in this movie. John Williams score is, as always, wonderful, and my personal favourite out of all the 'Star Wars' films.However, what I don't like about this film are the Ewoks, the native race of the forest moon who help the rebels. I'm not going to get into the whole debate on the Empire's best soldiers being defeated by a race of teddy bears (I actually think it makes sense since the Empire probably were not expecting them to attack and they have been likely using guerrilla warfare tactics for quite some time) but I do find them very annoying. They are suppose to be cute and funny, but the comedy just feels really out of place with random cutaways to them doing something really stupid and, to be honest, some of the costumes are really ugly but I don't really mind them as much as most people seem to do. I just wish the creators made them a little less comical.Overall, just like any of the original 'Star Wars' films, I find this to be a near masterpiece with very few flaws. Although not as mature as 'Empire' it is still very good and worth it if you like the first two films, although by this point you probably already have seen it.",9,0,0,13 February 2013
Pacific Rim," Stupid but I Love Every Minute of it
","Pacific Rim delivered exactly what it promised from the trailers. Spectacular action scenes. This film is not going to win any awards or be considered high art or anything but if it is one thing, it is highly entertaining without worrying about being criticised for being 'dumb', and call me simple minded or whatever, but I think that's kind of refreshing to see every once in a while, especially in this day and age of big budgeted, heavy drama filled action films. The story isn't really important, but basically, monsters are coming from an inter-dimensional portal in the Pacific Ocean and destroying the humans so that their alien masters would be able to colonise Earth no problem. The armies of Earth develop giant humanoid robots to fight back against these monsters and thus you have Pacific Rim.The only real criticisms I have is that maybe the drama scenes go on a bit too long as we as an audience don't really care about any of these characters but it is well worth it for the amazing spectacular actions scenes that look as though they came straight out of a mech anime. I can't really explain this action scenes in great detail, they have to be seen.If you want a little time killer to entertain you for a couple of hours and are a big fan of stuff like Godzilla or Gundam, then Pacific Rim is highly recommended.",6,1,5,7 June 2014
The Evil Dead," Cartoonishly Violent and I Love It!
","'Evil Dead' is a movie that you really should go and see without having and prior knowledge of it whatsoever.The story is a group of buddies all going to a cabin somewhere in the rural Tenessee woods for a weekend getaway. When they get there, they discover a weird book and some tapes. The tapes belonged to an archaeologist who was studying the book and came to the cabin to not get distracted by anything at home, he explains how he believes this to be the book of the dead, or Necronomicon, itself. He managed to translate some of the writings and speaks them out loud of the tapes. The words summon demons to the cabin that slowly possess each of the friends one by one until the lone survivor, Ash, has to fight off the rest of the demons and somehow escape from woods alive.Now, as soon as you see the phrase 'group of buddies' in the context of a horror movie, you want to roll your eyes. Yeah, it's a horror movie clich√© to have a bunch of boring and unlikable teens just there for the sake of getting killed. But wait! We actually care for their characters. Okay, they're not exactly three-dimensional Shakespeare characters but at least they are decent characters. Especially the relationship between Ash and his girlfriend, Linda. They're an adorable couple that you want to see live but it all ends in tragedy as the demons use Linda to torment Ash.The rest of the film? Really unique. There are very few films out there that can take place in one small space and hold my attention the entire running time. The cinematography is fantastic, with some shots really making you wonder how the hell they managed to do them. The atmosphere is fantastic, with very little music and more emphasis on sound effects. The wind blowing outside, the floorboards creaking, the squelchy noises the blood makes as the characters walk through them. Great stuff. The cabin itself is very creepy. If I saw anything like it in real life, I would just stay far away. It's widely known that the movie was on a really tight budget and the crew found the cabin abandoned in the forest. Knowing that makes it a whole more creepier.The effects are jaw-dropping and a true testament that practical effects will always beat CGI. The way the demons look, the white stuff they spray out of their mouth when they are stabbed or shot, the ridiculous amount of blood almost literally coming out the woodwork and the stop-motion finale.It's also pretty inspiring when you watch or read a lot of stuff that went on behind-the-scenes. How some of the effects where done, the hell the crew persevered through, the ridiculous controversy it caused especially in the UK but is now considered a horror classic. I highly recommend watching documentaries on the film if you have an interest in film making.Is there anything bad about the movie? Of course there is. While I did mention the characters were decent, the acting is a bit bland. Even Bruce Campbell as Ash who has become one of the biggest cult movie stars is nothing to write home about in this movie but when the characters become possessed, then they turn up the ham dial all the way up to 100 and it becomes far more entertaining. I also don't think I need to say anything about the infamous tree rape scene. It's just out of place even in a movie as crazy as 'Evil Dead.' Well, that's my take on it. If you haven't seen it, do me a favour and do it soon. It's one of the most creative, original, entertaining and greatest movies of all time.",8,1,2,2 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A timeless sci-fi/fantasy adventure.
","What can be said about 'Star Wars' that hasn't been said ever since 1977? It's one of the most popular films of all time.For all two of you out there who don't know the story, 'Star Wars' is about Luke Skywalker, a farm boy who is fed up with his boring life on the desert planet of Tatooine. His life is changed forever when two robots come into his possession, one of them carrying a message for someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke is then swept into an adventure with the robots, Obi-Wan and two smugglers to rescue a princess from the evil Empire and join the rebellion to destroy their ultimate weapon, the Death Star.Taking inspiration from classic Wild West and samurai movies and combining it with science fiction and fantasy elements, 'Star Wars' is a must-see for, well, anyone really. Everyone who has ever lived really should experience the magic of 'Star Wars' at least once in their lives.The special effects are nothing short of wonderful. Each of the alien creatures all look unique and easily distinguishable through use of animatronics, costumes and prosthetics. No CGI used here. The scenes of the ships flying through space are so well done, you would swear they were real. The sets are another real spectacle to look at. You can see in the backgrounds all the little details of flashing lights and computer monitors wondering what all this stuff does.The music by John Williams, do I really need to say anything? It is some of the greatest and most memorable music, well, ever, not just in films.The characters are also extremely memorable. The lovable scoundrel Han Solo, his faithful hairy companion Chewbacca, the wise old Obi-Wan, all of them great. Although the acting is little cheesy, especially with Mark Hamill as Luke. Thankfully, he got better as the series went on.If there are any flaws with the movie, they are not worth mentioning since they are so insignificant compared to the rest of the movie.Star Wars is a masterpiece of cinema, plain and simple. If you are one of the few people who have not seen it, get it on DVD or whatever and see what it's all about. You will not regret it.",9,1,2,11 February 2013
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Saga Continues
","Not only is 'Empire' as good as the original 'Star Wars', it surpasses it by light years.Taking place a couple of years after the first movie, the rebellion have made their headquarters on the remote ice planet of Hoth. The Empire find them and after an epic battle, our heroes go their separate ways. Luke and R2-D2 go to the swamp planet of Dagobah in search for a powerful warrior known as Yoda who will complete Luke's Jedi training and Han, Leia, Chewie and C-3PO are being pursued by the Empire across space.All the actors playing the main characters in the original make a return in this and have all improved over time, especially Mark Hamill who I personally felt was the weakest actor in the original (Not saying that his acting was bad, just not as good as it is here.) The budget was much higher for this movie than the last, allowing for even greater special effects and more lavish and highly detailed sets. For example, The interior of the Millennium Falcon is expanded upon and we get to see all the intricacies of the ship, it's great stuff.John Williams also returns as composer. We hear some of the classic music from the first movie as well as some new stuff which is just as good as you would expect.Overall, one of the greatest sequels in movie history, with more production value, more action, a more mature and darker storyline and having probably the most famous twist in movie history. If you enjoyed the first 'Star Wars' and have not seen this yet, then there is something wrong with you. Seriously.",9,0,0,12 February 2013
Evil Dead II," Outrageously violent and hilarious
","This half-sequel, half-remake of Evil Dead outdoes its predecessor in almost every aspect.After a brief recap of the events of the first film (Which does not include Ash's sister or best friend, further emphasising this is more of a remake than a true sequel), Ash still has no real way to escape the haunted woods and decides to defend himself from the demons inside the cabin, only to be joined by some strangers, one of whom is the daughter of the archaeologist who discovered the Book of the Dead which started everything and they work together to banish the demons permanently. Bruce Campbell returns as Ash and is delightfully hammy in the role. Everything he says and does, from the corny lines to his facial expressions, make me burst out in laughter. The other actors do a decent job, but Campbell just steals the show.Being on a much higher budget than the first Evil Dead means that the special effects are much more lavish and impressive than the first movie which really spectacular uses of animatronics and great monster designs not to mention the Ray Harryhausen style stop motion animations. It is a visual feast for the eyes.If there is anything that this movie has that is inferior to the first, it's that, having more of an emphasis on comedy, it is less atmospheric and spooky than the first Evil Dead which is a real shame, in my opinion however it is still entertaining and I love it more than the first Evil Dead.If you enjoyed the first Evil Dead and have not seen this movie, then it is a must-see, with hilarious slap-stick comedy, fantastic special effects and a brilliant main character.",8,0,0,10 March 2013
