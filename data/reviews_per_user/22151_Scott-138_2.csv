Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," In my humble opinion.
","I have just returned from what was my first of many Episode I viewings.  I will not spoil anything for any persons that have not yet seen the film with this review.  You too will love TPM if you follow these easy instructions. Before you sit down in the theater, do the following. resolve yourself not to judge this film against its predecessors, don't expect the campy hookieness of the originals and expect nothing. Ok, that last one is a little broad I admit. But, we have all grown up with Star Wars, we know names and places and facts so trivial, outsiders think us to be strange. That is why if you sit down with the burden of your love and admiration for the originals, you will not like this film.  You will fall prey to the criticisms you have heard and the fears that you harbor.  However if you follow my easy to use rules for TPM, your experience will mimic mine. What was my experience you may wonder? Amazing! So amazing in fact, that it is now 4 am I am going to post this review go to sleep and in 5 hours get up, shower and head back to the theater. See this film, so that you may see it again.Don't Listen to people who say. There is no story Jake Lloyds performance is stiff The CGI characters look fake JarJar is annoying It's not Star Wars The movie is too religiously preachy Etc.This is a great film, full of fun, excitement and action. It is a fine addition to a long-standing tradition. Besides if it was at all possible to watch the originals today without every having seen them before, most of us would agree that they aren't very good, just accept, as I have, that were all hooked on Star Wars. and enjoy the ride!",10,0,0,19 May 1999
Notting Hill," The local men's club may revoke my membership but...
","I liked it! There I said it. I like a movie with Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in it. (Now I feel dirty for saying it out loud) Anyway, it was fun, I laughed more than a handfull of times and I did not fall a sleep (sorry 'You've Got Mail' zzzzz) I can't give you a 'it's a rehashed 'Four Weddings'review cause I didn't see 4 Weddings, maybe it is, maybe it isn't, all I know is I was fully prepared to dislike this movie and go to sleep, and I liked it. God help me, please! What's next, will I start watching 'The Rosie O'Donnel show'? Now if you will excuse me I have to go find an overpass to throw myself from.",Null,0,0,16 May 1999
