Hereditary," One of the best!!
","This is my first review I've written for imdb but I had to show my appreciation for such a well thought out and superbly executed horror movie.One of the main reasons this movie was so impressive, was the great acting delivered by all cast members. The most outstanding being delivered by Toni Collette. Her different raw emotions, facial expressions and her commitment to the role absolutely made the movie. She was such an excellent casting choice that I couldn't see any other actor in that role. Every emotion she played as an actor, I felt as an audience member. Because of this movie I have a greater appreciation for Toni as an actor. The cinematography, creative scene changes, ominous score and the overall flow of the movie make for a haunting horror movie unlike any other. The dramatic scenes mixed in with the eerily spooky themes add to the anticipation of the movie climax. Admittedly the ending didn't do the movie justice but I was so impressed with the majority of the movie I was able to overlook the somewhat wanting ending. I cannot believe this movie flew under the radar in comparison to such horror movies as 'The Nun' which doesn't even hold a candle to 'Hereditary'. If there's one horror movie you need to see this year, make sure you watch Hereditary.",9,2,4,16 September 2018
