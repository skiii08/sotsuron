Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 is not the best in the trilogy but is still an entertaining movie
","Iron Man 3 is, for me at least, one big letdown. It is not a bad movie but it certainly is not what you'd expect after The Avengers. Robert Downey's charismatic take on the character was the big reason of the success of the previous movies in the franchise and he still hasn't lost his charm. He delivers his lines as witty as he can but at one moment the jokes become one too many. The movie derails from what it should be and becomes a comedy. And not in the good way. Most of the jokes are out of place in moments which should be dramatic and thus the scenes cannot be taken seriously.Ben Kingsley is great but the weak script doesn't do any good to the main villain. And a superhero movie needs a good villain which Iron Man 3 hasn't.Don Cheadle's character is mismanaged and doesn't contribute to the plot or the movie in any way.One of the good things in Iron Man 3 is Tony and Pepper's relationship which is handled really well and the chemistry between the actors reflects on the screen.The ending is forced in a way but after all the film ends on a high note. It certainly could have been better but given as it is Iron Man 3 is a good continuation to the story of Tony Stark that leaves you with wanting more and we all know at some point Robert Downey we put on the suit again and maybe we'll get a movie on the level of the original.",4,44,72,10 June 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Into Darkness is better than its predecessor in every single way
","Star Trek Into Darkness is one of the few sequels that succeed in besting the original on every single level. The scale is bigger, the stakes - higher, the emotional impact - stronger.Bennedict Cumberbatch delivers one of the best performances in recent years. He is great in the role of the villain and gives his character incredible depth and realism.The relationship between the Enterprise crew, and especially the on between Kirk and Spock, is explored on a higher level. We can relate to the characters and empathize them.Star Trek Into Darknes is a visual feast with its heart and soul. It looks amazing on the big screen so don't miss the chance to see it at the movies.",8,6,16,10 June 2013
