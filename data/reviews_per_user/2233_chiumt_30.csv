Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Fitting Followup To A Classic
","This is more of a continuation of the first installment, rather than a sequel. A lot is explained here. The classic trademarks of Tarantino are here. This is the second time I am watching this and it has remained fresh.",8,0,1,12 May 2019
Alien 3," An Addition To A Popular Sci-Fi Franchise
","Atmospheric, in a convict colony with no way out except for a rescue ship coming and trapped with an Alien. But it could be wearing out its original suspense. A good sequel so far, but it is wearing thin.",7,0,0,27 July 2019
Catch Me If You Can," Time Tested Classic
","A biopic about con-man Frank Abenathy. He seems to make it so simple - to pull a con job. Its captivating enough, the acting, the dialogue, the cinematography. It is time tested.",8,1,2,19 April 2019
The Ring," Interesting Idea but....
","A video that kills in 7 days. Interesting concept, but it's the execution. Based on the excellent Japanese horror movie. It's a mediocre remake.",6,0,1,28 April 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A Star Wars Spin-off
","An above average star wars franchise, but nevertheless a spin-off. The plot is ho-hum. Nothing original. The action and special effects are its saving grace.",7,0,3,15 March 2020
Alien: Resurrection," Another Alien Sequel
",Another in the alien franchise. And its getting stale. It is the worst after the 3rd sequel. It is watchable. Just that. But I was bored towards the end.,6,0,0,4 August 2019
Constantine," So-so Superhero Movie.
","I waited more than 10 years to watch this movie. To see if time transcends the movie. No. It does not seem dated. Although it is almost 15 years. But it does not captivate me the way some of the better Superhero movies do. No, I will say it is an average movie.",6,3,5,28 April 2019
Resident Evil: Extinction," Another Apocalyptic Movie
",Another franchise of the popular zombie and computer series. A post apocalyptic setting. Acceptable acting. Predictable dialogue. Cheesy special effects. Non-existent plotline. Main aim is to bank in the popularity of the original. Watchable sequel. But no artistic value.,6,0,1,29 June 2019
The Adventures of Tintin," A Worthy Adaptation Of A Comic Book
",A Steven Spielberg adaptation. It is computer animated and more realistic than hand drawn. The characters are more alike to the book. It is action packed and adventure filled. It has features of Pirates Of The Caribbean. The comic book humour is also realistic.,8,0,0,13 July 2019
Ocean's Twelve," The Past Catches Up
",An European heist now. The eleven are broke now because of the past. They must take on another job. This time in Europe. They take on another member. I like the locations and the soundtrack. The acting is credible. The plot is ok. This is a good sequel.,7,0,0,26 May 2019
Final Destination 2," Various Ways To Die
","An exploration on the various ways to die. That is all I can say of this movie. The second of a franchise. It is perhaps more of a series of sketches than a proper movie. That is how bad the dialogue, plot and characterization is. I started off with a rating of 6 but it deteriorated to 4 as the movie progressed.",4,0,1,13 June 2019
Life of Pi," Life Affirming Fable
","So which is the true story? That is the dilemma that we are left with at the ending. Basically, it is the story of the uneasy friendship between the protagonist and a bengali tiger. To survive the shipwreck, the human and the tiger must eventually trust each other and work together. A heartwarming story.",8,0,0,4 April 2020
Doctor Strange," A Special Effects Movie
","Mind-blowing visuals, exotic setting, originator beginning. Mediocre dialogue, plot acting. But an enjoyable movie. We, the uninitiated, know who Dr Strange is and why he is able to do what he is able to. But I wouldn't consider this as more than good.",7,1,1,8 December 2019
The Matrix Revolutions," Worthy End To Trilogy.
",A sci-fi Trilogy. Like so many of them. But I think this was a worthy end. The story had a final closure. At least in the movies. The ending was spectacular.,8,3,4,27 April 2019
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Convoluted Swedish Mystery
",Good production but overly long. Too long for a mystery thriller. Slow start and slow end. It doesn't enthrall as much as it should. Will watch the Swedish version. To see how it compares.,7,0,0,20 May 2020
Ocean's Eleven," A Good Con Movie.
","A Las Vegas casino heist job, with all its difficulties and complications. Not my cup of tea, but it is a good movie. Should appeal to fans of the Las Vegas series.",7,1,2,24 May 2019
Resident Evil," Just A Video Game Movie
","A movie banking on the popularity of the hit video game series. Entertaining, but the plot sucks. No originality. Just hack and shoot. Just zombie after zombie. But it's entertaining.... And Milla's short skirt is bonus eye candy. The ending is worth the rating. So watch till the end.",7,2,2,5 October 2019
Gone Girl," Twists And Turns Galore
",A wife goes missing. The husband becomes the main suspect. That is the opening of this mystery and thriller. The twists and turns keep coming. Then it starts getting incredible towards the end. I wasn't bored until towards the end. The ending is ominous but it drags on too long.,7,0,0,1 December 2019
1917," Poignant WW1 Movie
","A WW1 movie depicting the horrors of trench wwarfare.The squarlor, the pain of war, the terror and inhumanity. They are all here. My only complaint: by shooting the movie in a single shot, the movie may seem like a scenario with multiple scenes. But beautifully shot.",8,1,3,12 April 2020
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Another Sequel To A Zombie Franchise
","A shoot and kill movie. Two babes in short skirts instead of one. It is more of the same. No original storyline except more zombies and a near invincible bad-ass villain. Not a bad zombie movie with its special effects, but nothing original. I was bored soon.",5,0,3,26 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Franchise That Has Gone On Too Long...
",I wouldn't call it a bad movie. Just forgettable. It seems like the Star Wars world is running out of ideas. It has gone on too long. Frankly I was bored.,6,6,17,31 December 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A Classic Tarantino
","The violence, the gore, the humour, the story telling, the choreography. They are all there. I watched it then. My opinion has not changed. It has been tested by time and personal experiences.",8,2,5,11 May 2019
Thor," Just A Fantasy And Sci-fi Movie
","Just a sci-fi / fantasy movie. That is an excuse, using special effects for the film. If you are looking for mythic accuracy, forget it.",6,0,1,18 March 2019
The Matrix Reloaded," A worthy sequel to a classic
",The sequel to the Matrix doesn't disappoint. The opening scene is unforgettable. The fight sequences are impressive. The plot continues from where the original left off. It is not all action. It keeps you thinking. I will watch it again.,8,1,1,23 April 2019
Scream 2," Cashing On Success Of First Movie.
","Just a sequel. Watchable but not memorable. Again there is a lot of 'fake' blood. Poor dialogue. Almost no plot except for some serial killer running around some college. Watch it if your are bored, or curious after watching the first movie.",6,2,3,4 April 2019
Parasite," A Korean Masterpiece
","Slow moving at the beginning, but it picked up quickly to a gut-wrenching climax at the end. Comedy of errors, serious social commentary, human emotions and a horrifying climax. All the ingredients of a prize winning film.",8,1,2,22 April 2020
Munich," Based On A Famous Event
",Supposedly a true event. I remember that. A series of assassinations of the people involved in the Munich atrocity. The acting is credible. Production values are good. Time tested. It is a personal journey through a nation's vengeance. It is the third time I am watching this.,8,0,2,7 September 2019
The Matrix," A Sci-fi Classic
","I have watched this several times through the years. It has remained fresh, even though it is sci-fi. The opening sequence is classic. The Matrix is everywhere. What is it? You have to see it for yourself.",9,0,0,20 April 2019
300," A Time Tested Classic.
",I watched it when it was first released. This is the third time I am watching this. It has remained fresh. It is more a cinematic masterpiece than of historical accuracy. It is based on a Graphic novel and is in that style.,8,1,1,1 May 2019
Sin City," Comic Book Noir
","A dark movie in a typical comic book, a la Frank Miller style. Full of violence and sex. A memorable, noir movie. 3 stories set in the dark, violent sin city. The second time I'm watching it. And I'll watch it a third time.",8,0,0,14 September 2019
