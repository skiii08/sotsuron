Requiem for a Dream," Stunning
","I was skeptical of seeing this movie because I have to admit Pi was not exactly my favorite movie.  But after seeing Requiem, I left the theater stunned.  This was an incredible movie, with beautiful imagery and the entire cast was amazing.  Ellen Burstyn definitely deserves an Oscar for her role as a lonely and unknowing speed addict, and who knew that Marlon Wayans could act??  Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly were great as usual. The last few minutes of the movie left me horrified, but in a surprisingly good way.  You MUST see this movie.",7,1,1,22 October 2000
