Whip It," Congratulations Drew, you've done yourself proud!
","If you like to be entertained and you enjoy seeing some of the best actresses working today, you should see this film. Ellen Page is a delight. I thought she did more with this role than she did with Juno. Kristen Wiig was her usual funny self, The rest of the cast, including Zoe Bell (excellent in Tarantino's Deathproof), Juliette Lewis, Marcia Gay Harding, Daniel Stern, Drew, Jimmy Fallon, all performed well. That says something about Drew's directing. She elicited excellent performances out of her cast, the film was well shot, the sound and editing were nicely done and I look forward to seeing what Drew can do on her next effort.The premiere of Whip It, which took place on September 13th, 2009 at TIFF was enthusiastically well received by the audience.And by the way Drew, you looked smashing at the premiere! Congratulations!",9,96,138,13 September 2009
The Great Escape," My number one fave of all time
","This movie could not be made today due to financial reasons.  The producers of this film put together a stellar cast of actors that, if you are 35+ years old will be recognizable as top movie and television stars.  The movie itself is superb.  A great story, well acted and directed.  Based on a true story, but obviously fictionalised, the movie focuses on characterization and plot.  You care about these people and what happens to them.  If you can only see one movie about allied prisoners during wartime, see this one.",10,1,3,12 June 2003
