Changeling," Changeling wince
","I love Clint. I wanted to love this. I didn't. I wanted to agree with all the other glowing reviews on here but I can't. Angelina's cartoon like lips dominated the screen to the point where they began to grate. Hats off to Clint. The film looked amazing. The isolation of her character was intense and very well drawn but the constant close attention to her face just moved attention away from other characters (who were hugely reduced) and from the story. Sadly when they did appear they were not wholly appealing. The police were one dimensional characters of stock 'we've been caught with our provincial pants down' plot lines and the 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' scenes in the psychiatric ward were less harrowing and more hackneyed. The best scenes were from the mother of the returning child, who escaped from the serial killer and the trial and enquiry running together. However, if I had been the Changeling, I would have stayed at home rather than live with those lips. Sorry Clint.",3,6,15,13 April 2009
District 9," Sci Fi with a difference
","The central character is really excellent in this film, taking the dull day to day human with his trivial self into the complete unknown in a world he thinks he controls. His allegiance to man dissolves along with his bodily self in a way that grips. The downright blunt references to apartheid are not lost on the audience but neither are they so bludgeoning as to affect the films art. I loved the way this film teetered on the edge of it's story and the way it slams it's characters in your face. The running news was effective although I found the count'UP' from the central characters 'exposure' did not add to the pace. By far the best scene is when Christopher sees the experiments in the lab. Great moment.. The ending also is superb. I love the way that the uncertainty of what the humans have done; that the ending itself is uncertain is perfect. Go see it.",9,2,4,13 September 2009
