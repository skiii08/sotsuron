Sucker Punch," Too Hard to Understand
","This movie was, in my opinion, too confusing. At first, everything seems to make sense, the stepfather is trying to kill the children to get the money. But within 2 minutes, things start to get weird. First off, Baby Doll hits the light bulb with the gun, which is hanging from the ceiling, but yet her sister is still hit, appearing to be about 4 foot tall. What's even worse, it hits her waist! As well, the movie spends too much time in the fantasy acid trip harem whatever you call it, and not enough time in the 'real world'. It became too hard to determine what was actually happening. And then the ending was a cop-out. They just said, 'Oh yeah, this girl is not the main character, the other one is.' My only compliment is that the fight scenes are awesome!",1,5,12,18 November 2016
