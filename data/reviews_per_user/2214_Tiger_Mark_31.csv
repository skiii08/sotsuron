The Legend of Bagger Vance," This was rank!
","This film was one of the most pathetic movies I have ever seen. Total claptrap. Simplistic script, shallow characters and rancid storytelling. It will leave you screaming at the screen, 'grow up!' The problem with this film is that it is so corny. It tries to be the big, sentimental golf film for the ages. However, it comes across as so sappy, that even a golf enthusiast like myself felt ill. Nothing new in the story here, down and out athlete that is inspired to be special again. Damon is the 'poor' athlete that is just so sad. Enter his inspiration, Will Smith, doing his best impersonation of an 80 year old house servant from the 1850's. Will Smith is so bad in this film, that I was amazed he was allowed to continue with the project. I would love to describe some of the other characters in this film, but they were so hollow, that there is simply nothing to describe. I believe Redford thought he could market this film to middle age golfers and cash in. However, the smoltzy nature of this material is just hard to watch with a straight face. There is a good reason why this film bombed, if you watch it, you will know.",1,4,9,30 January 2002
Ali," Does not do justice to 'The Greatest'
","I am a huge fan of Michael Mann and a boxing historian. As a result, I was rather thrilled to see that Mann was chosen to do this film, he is very gifted. I was less than thrilled to see Will Smith get this role, however, I was willing to give it a fair shot. Well, I was let down in a big way. I really think this film got lost in the edit. They took the most fascinating boxer in the history of the sport, who fought in more big fights than any other, and made a rather dull movie. In fact, this movie has the looks of a made for TV mini-series. However, the most upsetting thing about it, is Mann's insistence on focussing on such trivial matters. Most of the main events of Ali's life are skimmed and long extended scenes are given to nothing, like Ali dancing. I did not buy Smith, he looked like the Fresh Prince trying to pretend he was Ali. Never did I once buy him as Ali. Voight was pathetic as Cossell and the actors that were brought in to play such characters as Sonny Liston were poor. Overall, this movie, although made by a legend, failed to capture the essence of the the 'Greatest.'",4,3,5,25 August 2003
Training Day," Both Good and Bad
","This film is kind of like the two officers that are the main characters, good and bad. There are scenes that are really good and creative. In particular, the 'card game' scene towards the end, very  intense. However, there are way too many MTV Music Video scenes as well. No characters other than the main two have any depth whatsoever. You see talented actors like Scott Glenn trying to bring something extra to their scenes, but there is nothing written for them. Moreover, some scenes are just plain silly and you want to groan. Acting tends to be the over the top. However, in my opinion, it is the work of Ethan Hawke that really saves this film over all. Hawke portrays a character that I think most people can relate to, he does what we would probably do if in his situation. Overall, I would give this movie a B-, because it showed potential, but had too many mistakes.",1,27,56,4 March 2003
Monster," A sympathetic view of a 'monster'
","The buzz surrounding this film is that of Charlize Theron's physical transformation. However, perhaps people should be talking about her psychological transformation. Because even though she physically pulls off this performance, she nails it in the mentality aspect as well. The story chronicles the life of America's first celebrated serial killer. The focus tends to surround the events and tragedies that helped to transform her into one, instead of focusing on her actual crimes. I suppose law and order types will be upset about that, claiming it is a 'liberal' movie that attempts to rationalize murder. It is true that the director does play a little fast and loose with the actual killer in question. However, I think the movie is justified. It is easy to say there are bad people out there that should be executed. But many of these people were not born that way. Tragedies beyond their control happen and their lives take on a very different and ugly path. In summation, the performances were great (Theron will win best actress), the music was terrific, the direction tight and the story entertaining. I think this was a very special film.",10,0,0,18 January 2004
The Hustler," One of the best films of all time!
","Watching this film, you have to keep asking yourself, how did Newman not win the Academy for his performance. Newman gives a great, self destructive performance as 'Fast' Eddy Felsen, a pool shark, trying to find his way. However, there are many great performances in this film. George C. Scott as a shark of his own, and Jackie Gleason as the legendary 'Minnesota Fats'. Top actors at the top of their games, it does not get any better. **** out of *****.",10,3,4,25 November 2002
We Were Soldiers," Stimulating, for a 1st grader
","This has to be one of the worst movies about war ever made. Pure sentimental claptrap. However, there are so many bad things about this movie, I feel I will forget something. Let us begin with Mel Gibson and his accent. What part of the country he is supposed to be from, I am not sure. Then there is the geography of Vietnam, which looks a lot like Central Texas. I swear I saw numerous Texas Live Oaks. I don't want to be too picky here, but Vietnam (any tropical country) does not resemble this terrain at all. Then you have the NVA troops that all like to run right up to our American boys without firing their weapons. Our boys shoot them as they run with their AK 47's in hand. Now that is just bad training. If the NVA had only known how to actually fire a weapon, they might have won this war. Hey, wait a minute, they did win this war. Other acting performance were shallow and undeveloped.Look, it is no shock why this film is accepted. It is told on about a 2nd grade level and is crammed full of patriotic and military pride. It is an easy recipe for success with the masses, but hardly great.",1,4,10,13 June 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The Greatest Movie Ever Made! Period!
","I have heard people call this the greatest comedy ever made. I feel that is an injustice to the film. This is the greatest movie ever made, which happens to be a comedy. I don't consider this statement to be that bold. Let's face it, Stanley Kubrick was the greatest director of all-time. Why wouldn't his defining masterpiece be considered the greatest film ever? Moreover, Peter Sellers, one of the greatest actors of all-time, gives his greatest performance/performances. Three characters, each unique and each unbelievably funny. George C. Scott, the great dramatic actor, makes you laugh as hard as you can. Add to this, the great Sterling Hayden, preaching about the evils of communism and the greatness of a nuclear holocaust. However, when describing the greatness of this film, you have to take into account it's historical importance. This was a film about a nuclear war between two superpowers, which seemed on the verge of real nuclear war. Moreover, it was released right after the assassination of JFK. With so much negativity and impending doom everywhere, Kubrick goes and makes a film that makes people laugh at it all. Imagine that, seeing a film in the most tense moment of the cold war, that deals with the entire world blowing up, and you leave the theater laughing? That my friend, is Kubrick and that is why he was the greatest.",10,1,2,8 September 2003
Scary Movie 2," This was a Funny Movie!
","I am ashamed to admit it, but this was funny. I am in my 30's, but I still thought it was great. It is crude, base and lacking in any class, but funny as heck. Talented cast and funny spoofs. The people that were critical of this movie need to lighten up. Cross and Elliot are beyond funny and Keenan Ivory Wayans shows that he still has his finger on the pulse of what is funny. Let me get this straight, people paid to see this so they could see the trailer for 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'? This was much funnier than that Kevin Smith piece of nonsense.",10,0,2,12 November 2002
Lost in Translation," Visually and Spiritually Soothing
","I think Copola finally got the right idea. Simplify your story, get a small cast that is incredibly talented, and let things happen by themselves. I have to admit, I thought that 'The Virgin Suicides' was horrible! So when I heard that she was loose again, I figured, man, it must be nice being kin to Francis Ford Copola. However, Sofia comes through with the goods on this one. Oh sure, it does bog down a little towards the middle. However, all in all, it is a fine movie. I loved the great shots of Japan and the atmosphere shown through the camera. Scarlett Johansen is a huge star in the making (if not already) and Bill Murray, well, he is Bill Murray (an American ICON!) If you want to know what it is like to be truly isolated, this film shows it. Isolation in one of the most crowded cities in the world. It is this isolation that brings people together, people that would have never ever come together. And this is what happens, people that are alone in a foreign land, away from loved ones, come together. But just how close are they really? Are they truly meant to be with one another or is it just a moment in time? Wow, tough one. One that will have you thinking for sometime, should he or shouldn't he have?",10,0,0,26 December 2003
The Bourne Identity," The 'Boring' Identity
","I figured this was a can't miss movie. Doug Liman is a great director and it seemed like the cast was pretty strong. However, what a standard, paint by the numbers, average at best, spy thriller. Do we really have to wait two hours for the happy ending that we all know is coming in the end? The scenes of Europe were nice, but hardly enough. Added to the problems of this movie is the fact that Matt Damon is just not that strong of actor, he seems to be void of any real charisma. The guy is plastic and unless you are a 14 year old girl, not worthy of your time. In this movie we get to see him kind of interact with a romantic interest, however it is tacked on and less than steamy. Talk about going through the motions. The bad guys have no redeeming qualities, the good guy is a saint, yata yata. What shocked me was why this movie was getting such high marks, it was 'Ronin' without the action. Once again, mediocrity is praised as good and good is praised as great. Well, this movie was not great or even that good. Sadly lacking.",1,20,47,23 September 2002
American Psycho," Is this really happening?
","What a brilliant film! I read the book and had serious questions over whether it could be pulled off on the big screen, but it sure was. The key to this movie was the casting of Patrick Bateman. I had heard that the role was first offered to Leonardo DiCaprio. Thank God, he turned it down! Christain Bale is just superb in the role.The story revolves around a trader working Wall Street during the mid 1980's. He is your typical 'yuppie' of the 1980's, totally consumed with himself and style. However, this yuppie is also on the fringes of insanity. How insane he is, you don't know, because he is the narrator. In fact, one of the great things about this film, is that you don't know what is real or what is playing out in the imagination of Patrick Bateman.Many films have tried to capture the essence of the 1980's, few have done it. This movie achieves that and then some. It show what a truly pretensious, greedy and hollow decade it was. It was the decade of Reagan. People are so wrapped up in themselves, that they fail to see the danger that surrounds them and in fact might kill them. Great filmmaking, **** out of ****.",10,1,2,16 August 2001
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Been there, done that.
","I guess as we see Arnold's film career spiral further down, we will have to indulge him a little more. We will have to endure his publicity stunt involving him being Governor of California and we will have to see him try to go back to something that worked for him before. So, here goes Terminator 3. Sadly, the third installment is by far the weakest of the trilogy. The character and the story has been played out. Oh sure, Arnold's character is much more hero-friendly than the the first installment and even second installment. However, as I watched this standard paint by the numbers sci-fi thriller play itself out, I just felt depressed. You are seeing Arnold try to recreate a character that he was close to twenty years ago. Oh sure, it does not take great range to do so, but still. Perhaps it is naive to expect Arnold to have matured a little bit in his acting career. However, I guess we will not see that Clint Eastwood maturation. Oh well, what is next, Total Recall 2 or Eraser II? Certainly not Last Action Hero 2, Oh Lord, please NO! * out of ****.",1,0,1,3 July 2003
Rocky IV," Rocky officially dies
","I know that it was tempting to Sly to keep making Rocky movies. They made money and people liked the character. The character made Sly. Sure, he had the Rambo character to fall back on, but this was his original love. However, Rocky IV is so horrible, that it momentarily causes us to forget how much we loved the original. It could be said that other than the original and maybe Rocky III, this series has been a disaster. In Rocky IV we have singing robots, more friends dying, plenty of red-baiting and final fight that is so unrealistic, that the WWF would have never aired it. Rockey literally is beaten to a pulp. He is knocked down more than eight times and takes twenty shots in the head before being able to get his hands up. No person could ever survive that beating and no referee would have ever let that beating continue. I guess, the pro-American Rocky vs. the Dirty Communist Drago was good red meat in 1985, with Reagan's America. But looking back at it now, you have to wonder how Sly had the nerve to come back with one more movie?",3,10,24,13 July 2004
Ocean's Eleven," Was it supposed to make you ill?
","I can think of few films I hated more in the last couple of years than this one. It was sappy, fluffy, predictable, unoriginal, uninspired, unimaginative, claptrap! Hmmm, what did I leave out? Of course, fans of the movie will say it is emulating the original 'Rat Pack' product. I suppose they are right, because that film was poor as well. Is it an accomplishment when you remake a bad film badly? So why remake it? Uhh, so Brad Pitt and George Clooney can try to be suave? Yeah, I guess so. It certainly was not to let Julia Roberts display her acting prowess, this is a phoned in performance all the way (poor Julia, she wanted to look cool as well). No, this was a Steven Soderbergh ego trip. A way for him to say 'look at me!' I looked, and I have the same impression that I have had after viewing all of his films. He is Jerry Bruckheimer with a few more IQ points. By the way, that is not a compliment.",1,3,10,5 February 2004
Pearl Harbor," Hollywood at it's Worst!
","I was blown away at how bad this film was. However, I believe that Pearl Harbor is the future in Hollywood. Take a subject that people are familiar with, create some really good special effects that cost millions, pack it full of young stars that are not great actors and then pound out a script in a couple of minutes. What a disgrace to an actual historical event by making this over-simplified, moronic piece of garbage. Bruckheimer and Bey have no respect for film, just music videos for 12 year olds. You could get more of an education by hitting yourself in the head with a hammer.",1,0,1,12 September 2002
The Usual Suspects," Can you say Overrated?
","Yeah, the film has a very neat ending, real neat. However, in the scheme of things, what else does this film have? Not much. This was one of those pretty good films that gets tagged with the 'Great' label, all because it is a little different from the mainstream crap being turned out at Studio City. This is not an epic film, I am sorry. Spacey was good Byrne was good and the ending was clever, but if you take a long hard look at the whole film, you will see average movie making. I just don't see the greatness in the overall film. Now 'Frailty', there is a movie that improves on what this film wanted to be.",1,26,51,15 April 2002
Good Will Hunting," Can you say 'hype'?
","I know for sure, that if Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had not been the ones credited with having wrote this film, nobody would have seen this film. Whats more, nobody would have cared. This is Hollywood at its 'Indie' best. Trying to pretend that some of their hot properties can be artistic as well. The only problem is that this film is so painfully average and predictable, that few film festivals would have given it the time of day, had it not been for the writers. The story is an old one, just set in a bit of a different setting. Young tough, down on his luck, born poor, no future, gets opportunity and betters himself. Ahhh, what a 'feel good' story. Please! I just love the scene in the bar where Will shows up the cocky Harvard kid on his knowledge of American History. Damon reels off one of the most laughable historical arguments in American History. The information is accurate, but the source is ludicrous. There is no way that his character could make such an argument, even if he had read the authors and understood them. He showed knowledge of the Harvard curriculum that even someone in the Liberal Arts Department would not know. It just strained credibility as this whole movie does. It was an average at best movie that was hyped into a masterpiece. I dismiss the Academy, because I know how the Hollywood Insider game is played. I mean, come on, Kim Bassinger and Mira Sorvino have an Academy! LOL! I mean, Beverly Hills Cop won for best screenplay, even though it had been passed around for five years. In reality, this film is ** out of ****. However, did you know that Matt and Ben wrote it? **** out of ****.",1,56,127,29 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A television series with a bad edit
","Was I the only one that felt this movie resembled a  first TV show following a season ending finale? Five different story lines to bounce back to and from. One story line is interesting, one is not. One should be avoided, one should be shown more. All the time, looking like a simplified, packaged, paint by the numbers, episode of Charlie's Angels. OK, the special effects are great, but that is all that is being sold here. The acting is second rate and the script laughable. If this thing is nominated for best picture, we will know for sure, that the Academy truly doesn't mean anything. Count me out of the hype!",1,1,6,2 February 2003
Dog Day Afternoon," Pacino's Greatest Ever Performance
","Not only is one of our greatest actors of all-time at the top of his game in this great film, but one of our greatest directors, Sidney Lumet is also on the top of his game. Dog Day Afternoon tells the story of a bank robbery gone awry. The planner is a former bank employee named Sonny, who needs money to pay for his boyfriend's sex change operation. When you hear that plot, you think comedy. Indeed, this movie is a black comedy, however, as we see in various scenes, it is also very serious. In fact, the tragic ending is a sober dose of real tragedy. Pacino makes this movie, he is that bankrobber, way over his head, trying in vain to make everything work out in the end. However, Sonny and Sal (his bankrobbing buddy) are just in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, I am glad I was able to see them there, trying in vain to make it all work out. **** out of ****.",10,6,7,18 November 2003
Mulholland Drive," You lost me, David.
","Let me first say that I thought 'Blue Velvet' was one of the greatest movies ever. I loved that film and I kind of became a Lynch fan as a result. I was a little letdown by 'Wild At Heart', I thought it was all style and no substance. I was more letdown by 'Lost Highway', one of the worst movies ever made. I did not care for 'Dune' or 'The Straight Cut' (I think that was the lawn mower movie?). Well, it got me thinking, is Lynch in a rut? Or is he just not much of a filmmaker? Well, I am going with the second one. The man cannot tell a story, he can't. He has to get far out and carried away, because it conceals the fact that the story is not nearly as clever as he would have you believe. I know there are a lot of these 'artist' types that are going to tell me that I am not advanced enough to understand the nuances of this last story, but that is a bunch of crap. Mulholland Drive comes apart like a poorly wrapped christmas present. I wanted very badly to like this film and I would say that I was going to go thumbs up through the first hour and fortyfive minutes. However, this film falls apart so badly in the last 45 minutes, that I went thumbs down. It is a classic style of filmmaking. Come up with some nonsense ending and let all of the self professed artists out there read their own ending into the film. Of course if you were to ask Lynch what the ending meant, he would have no idea what to say. Probably give you some bull about interpreting the art on your own. Yeah right! Fool me once, shame on you, fool me four times, shame on me. Be advised, this is more Lynch nonsense that will leave you shaking your head as you ponder asking for your money back. If you are one of Lynch's brilliant disciples that can interpret his psychotic illusions, have a good time. But save your 'how deep' lines for your buddies at the coffee house.",5,2,4,29 October 2001
From Dusk Till Dawn," So much gratuitous violence, sex and profanity. I loved it!
","This movie has gratuitous violence like you have never seen before. Female Vamps being slammed down on table legs, guys ripping still beating hearts out of bodies, band members playing mutilated corpses like a guitar. Heck, this movie has naked girls dancing everywhere. It has a character that rapes and kills old bank teller hostages. A character named Sex machine, who has a gun with two barrels that looks exactly like a certain reproductive organ. The story is as deep as the kiddy pool. Heck, there is not one redeeming thing in it. That being said, it remains one of my favorite all-time movies! **** out of ****!",10,0,1,29 September 2003
Black Hawk Down," Good but not Great
","Well, if you want action, this one has it. About two hours of action and that is the major strong point. However, what this movie is short on, is script and emotion. The scenes not involving the actual gun battles are just flat. It had the feel of a Bruckheimer film, create a series of detailed action scenes and then slap a story around it. Part of this might be the fault of the actual story as told in the book, but I don't think so. I am probably being too negative here, because it was a pretty good film. However, some of the action scenes were in desperate need of some other scenes in between. At some points in the film there is action for at least 30 minutes straight, although realistic in a combat situation, it grows tiring in a movie theater setting. Moreover, there were no real standout performances. I believe that the Academy really would have liked to have given a nomination to one of the actors, but nobody really was that strong or stood out. Man, I was too negative. This was a pretty good film. Good but not great. A solid 7.5 on a scale of 10.",7,0,0,20 February 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Can you erase fate ?
","It seems like Hollywood is fascinated with the question of whether things are destined to happen or whether freewill determines our actions. Donnie Darko delved into that issue in a brilliant, but somewhat complex way. In 'Eternal Sunshine' we are treated to an examination of the stated issue, but in a clear and rather easy to understand way. Joel has had a both wonderful and difficult relationship with Clementine. However, after the fun has ceased to be, Clementine decides to call the whole thing off, actually, she attempts to erase all memories of the relationship. By using a new type of medical procedure, one can remove all memories about something you no longer care to remember. Just think of it, taking your most traumatic memories at getting rid of them forever. Of course, Joel is not aware that Clementine has done this. When heartbroken Joel finds out, he decides that turn about is fair play, so he will cancel his memories of her out. However, as Joel soon discovers, relationships might always end badly, but they were not always bad. Can Joel keep the good times in his memory? If meeting someone is fate, can two people destined for one another really be prevented from meeting or forgotten? I enjoyed this film and although the story might seem complicated, it really is easy to follow. Nice story, great performances and interesting things to think about after you have left the theater. **** out of ****.",10,0,2,1 May 2004
From Hell," Shoddy direction
","This was not a well crafted film. I kept thinking I was watching some made for TV movie of the week. It was supposed to be a mystery, but you would have to be a total dunce to not figure out who the Ripper was. I will give you a hint, it is the obvious choice that the filmmakers attempt to shy you away from. Then there was Heather Graham, the great actress from Austin Powers (do you sense some sarcasm?) Heather Graham's accent kept reminding me of the Gilligan's Island episode where Mary Ann played the cockneyed flower girl. You know the one, where Gilligan was Mr. Hyde? Come to think of it, that episode was scarier than this film. Depp was pretty good, he usually is. However, the story was just not very convincing and full of holes. There were many gadgets and tricks that you have seen a hundred times before and the climax was so predictable. If you don't have an interest in Jack the Ripper, you are not likely to gain one after watching this film. These two brothers made a name for themselves directing gangsta films and I think that is where there strength lies, if they have a strength. Leave the historical based films to better story tellers. This was  ABC & MTV 'go to the movies' and the result is a film that will leave you wandering what is on TBS later that night. Perhaps I am being too harsh, but as student of the Jack the Ripper case, I felt letdown.",4,3,6,13 November 2001
Mystic River," Grossly Overrated
","I have to admit, the build-up for this film was pretty impressive. I believe it made the top ten lists of more critics than any other film. Therefore, I was expecting something incredible. Perhaps I was expecting too much. This film plays like your classic formulaic, book adaptation. Moreover, in many places it seemed like something that would be seen in a made for cable mini-series. Now I do admit that Penn and Robbins were good, they always are. However, so many other performances were just plain average. I love Eastwood, truly do. However, he is just not a great director (Unforgiven being the one exception).The story starts with three innocent boys and ends with two eyes wide open men. Grief and sadness are everywhere. As is vengeance and remorse. The problem is the paint by the numbers story. It just seems like a step by step murder mystery. This piece of evidence leads to this one and so on. Somewhere, the actions and emotions of the actors are lost among the framework of the story. The performances of the leads get it 7 out of 10. However, 'Lost in Translation' would get by vote for best picture, easy.",4,2,5,30 December 2003
Signs," An Interesting Film
","Watching this film, you are kind of transported back into a past Spielberg/Hitchcok era. The whole film has that kind of vibe. It almost has the feel of an old Midnight/Cult movie. A movie that transports your mind and feelings into a place of its own. It is not really scary, but it is plenty spooky and strange. Moreover, you  get caught up in what is happening in the story and you think about how you might act if the same really happened to you. You play their actions in your mind and ask, is that what I would do? The story starts and you think like you are supposed to, this is not happening. However, as the movie develops, you are involved and it is happening. There are strong messages of faith and love in this film, just like in M. Night's other films. It might not be the greatest film you will ever see, but you will enjoy it and remember certain parts for long while. *** out of ****.",8,0,2,17 August 2002
Final Destination," What a stupid movie!
","This film goes beyond bad. It is atomic bad. Geez, where do you start? Bad acting, bad story, bad directing, bad everything. I was expecting something remotely interesting, because the subject matter was unique. However, I did not get it. The potential for a decent movie is there in the first 15 minutes, but the movie falls off so badly that you will be checking the clock several times, hoping for a final destination. That is so common in today's movies, find a decent hook, but never follow it up with strong characters or story development. Instead, resort to retread scenes that you have seen in countless other teen movies. This movie was stupid and geared for a 7th grade mentality. And if you don't die laughing at the end when they are supposedly in Paris at a cafe, there is something wrong with you. Heck, you can practically see MGM back lot workers walking by in the background with props and set pieces.",2,6,11,7 April 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An amazing video game..I mean movie
","I have seen a lot of movies made from computer programs, Lara Croft, etc.. However, this computer generated cartoon beats them all. No, nobody really gave a great performance individually or they would have got a nomination and won it no doubt. But the graphics, oh man, they almost looked like a real movie being shot. Moreover, the special effects were incredible. I can see why this movie won seven Oscars for special effects alone. I mean, you have to give it to this movie, it had some great special effects. Oh sure, the acting was overdone and a bit sappy, but man, get a look at the special effects here. I mean, it won 11 Oscars, so I guess it must be the best film ever, even though nobody from the film was acknowledged for their performance, because nobody was really great in it, but man, the special effects here, outstanding. Hey, a billion geeks can't be wrong.",1,14,45,2 March 2004
Heat," The greatest crime drama ever!
","They do not get more perfect than this film. All of the pieces for a masterpiece are in place. You have the two biggest actors of the last twenty years, Pacino and DeNiro. You have some great talent in the supporting cast, Sizemore, Voight, Noonan. Kilmer, etc. You have one of the best bad guys ever in Waingro (Kevin Gage). Coordinating these brillinat actors together is one of the greatest directors of our time, Michael Mann. Brilliant dialog, direction, choreography, cinematography, etc.The movie centers around the relationship between 'cops' and 'robbers.' Mann shows us just how close these two groups are to one another. After all, if you devote your whole life to staking these robbers out, thinking like them and investigating them, you are in reality, living their life. Pacino's character is consumed with busting guys that 'take down scores.' His marriages collapse, his personal life is non-existant. Moreover, the robbers live an almost identical existance. They plot and plan and steal. Living for the score. This movie shows you that criminals do live by a code and cops get off on the action just as much as the cons.The real strength of this film is the great story and dialog provided by Mann. He used hours and hours of prison interviews to get 'con literate.' The result is dialog that is real and a story that is all too plausible. In fact, several bank heists were directly inspired by the events portrayed in this film. Now this is not a good thing, but does show just how on the ball Mann was in his script. **** out of ****.",10,1,1,3 November 2003
Gangs of New York," A Valiant Attempt
","I imagine that this was a really fine book and I imagine a rather long book as well. Hence the problem with this film. There is too much too tackle and not enough time. The result is a movie that has you wondering why some stuff was included and other stuff omitted. The movie itself is not bad, Scorscese is too talented to make a bad film. However, whereas 'Goodfellas' tackled a long and detailed story completely, 'Gangs' looks like it was butchered in the edit. Daniel Day Lewis is good and Diaz and DiCaprio are fair, but several of the other actors were never given a chance to develop at all. The sets are great and for a history buff, the movie hits the spot. However, as far as standard enjoyment pleasure, this one is lacking. Nice try, Marty.",6,0,0,26 December 2002
Donnie Darko," Great Film, I just wish I understood it.
","There are some films like 'Mulholland Drive,' that confuse you, and irritate you. In the end, you sense that they are just incoherent and stupid, thus you dislike them. Donnie Darko confused the hell out of me and I loved it! I like the music, the cinematography, the performances, the direction, everything. The movie challenges you and you don't mind, because you know that there is a greater meaning there. Unlike the typical David Lynch garbage.I understand that this was the first film made by this director and I believe that. I have always felt that Directors tend to have all of their heart and soul into that first film, usually because they have been writing and modifying it their whole lives. They hold on to it and refuse to let anybody else have it, like a first child. I know that was true with Singleton's 'Boyz n the Hood' and Anderson's 'Boogie Nights.'Be advised that this film is confusing and you might have to watch it a few times, ala 'Memento.' Moreover, don't be shocked when you find yourself picking up new things each time and enjoying it even more. However, don't think that this will help clarify matters, it hasn't helped me much. But I still love it! Don't get me wrong, I understood about 95% of the film, however the very last 5% just put me in a tailspin.The story deals with every aspect of genre. There is romance, horror, drama, comedy, mystery and science fiction. I guess what I respect so much about the film is just how much thought and effort went in to it. It is a very ambitious movie. Which begs the question, why was it not a bigger hit?I will watch it again and someday, possibly understand it fully. Well, I did understand most of it and then the ending just threw me. Oh well, the answers are out there and I will keep looking for them, and enjoy doing so. **** out of ****.",10,0,0,30 March 2002
