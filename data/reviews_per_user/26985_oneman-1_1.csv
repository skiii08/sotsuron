The Avengers," A big disappointment after all the hype!
","The first 45minutes take place in the dark and that's a bummer if you're watching in 3D. Then the last hour delivers with a lot of mayhem and destruction but unfortunately it's more of the same old, same old. Flying robot lizards destroying New York buildings anyone? Didn't I see the same thing in Transformers etc? Do they just modify the CGI a tad and throw them in the next blockbuster I wonder? So much action and yet we were quite bored. Some funny lines here and there otherwise a disappointment from a good director. Movie will make a killing but I'm wondering how much more CGI chaos we can endure before we start giving these type of movies a skip? The suits running the studios are only interested in chasing a sure thing so all we're going to get are sequels and reboots. Wish we could get the 70's back when the directors ruled in Hollywood and the accountants worked in Wall Street. Mind you, I have all the best movies shot in the 70's on DVD so I'll just watch them over again until I get my mojo back...",5,16,56,27 April 2012
