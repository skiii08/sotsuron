Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Was never going to live up to the fan's expectations
","Lets face it - Star Wars Episode 1 was never, ever going to be the ground-breaking, generation-changing movie that so many people wanted it to be. The world in the late 20th century is so much more cynical than that, and so many people have their own ideas about what this film was going to be like that when they didn't see their own imagination on the screen they hated it - lets face it, the die-hard Star Wars fan had waited sixteen long years to see this movie.Myself, I was stunned. Fair enough, the special effects kind of over-ran the movie, overwhelming you at first sight and, strangely, making you wonder what it was you just saw, but with repeated viewings it all makes sense. The thing is, you shouldn't have to watch it again and again to appreciate it. It should hit you the first time.Still, it is an incredibly enjoyable movie and, despite the rantings of die-hard Star Wars fans and the biting of critics who just want to get noticed, it is an excellent addition to the series.",Null,0,0,26 April 2000
The Mummy," Great fun
","Oh, come on - its not as if the film could ever have been made in a serious tone. The idea of a long-dead bandaged guy walking about and going 'uuuur' doesn't exactly bring you to the edge of your seat, does it? So, in deference to the fact that no-one would ever take this film seriously, the moviemakers opted for the big, dumb action movie. Turn off your cynic glands and watch it with a tongue-in-cheek attitude and you'll love it. Go in there expecting some kind of horror classic remake and you'll be swearing at the sliver screen for the whole time. Classic stuff.",Null,0,0,26 April 2000
Event Horizon," Wasted Opportunity
","I was lloking forward to seeing this film for a long time - the mystery of the dissapearance of the first ever ship to fold space and travel to another star. The concept was very interesting.After the initial thrill, it turned into Hellraiser in space, and the entire chance to explore the wonders of what the first ever traverse of interstellar space and a real mystery was thrown away for gory effects and a very thin reason as to why things were happening. Do film producers that the viewer is an idiot? 'They won't understand basic physics, just throw in some gore, that'll entertain them?' I like to think that movies have come a long way since the shock value of the 1980's.",Null,1,2,25 April 2000

The Matrix," A work of genius
","Its difficult to explain. The film grabs you from the very beginning, making you wonder what is going on, what it all means, and slowly it starts to unravel. When you realise what it is that is happening, you then go on to wonder 'what can they do with that knowledge?' Its not like the secret is unveiled and the film is over, making you sit back in your seat and think 'wow'. It clips along at a fantastic pace, with enough to watch on the screen to make sure that you don't have the time, or the inclination, to turn away. Its a stylish, highly original piece of filmmaking and will be the milestone for many of its kind for years to come.",Null,0,0,26 April 2000
Gladiator," People are so cynical these days
","I've read many comments and thoughts on the film Gladiator (not just what's written below) and it's come to my attention that this amazing piece of film-making is going to be one of those movies people love, hate or are non-plussed about.I've seen many people who have commented on the historical accuracy of the film. Well, no offence, but I'm not a student in history and I don't really care about details. I can't speak latin and I didn't want to go and see a movie that was subtitled for the apparantly less intelligent or observant viewer. Also, no matter what archaeology tells us or what history books inform us of, the actual look and design of the film was still speculative, based as it is on a culture two thousand years ago. They were trying to tell a story, not go back in time, and I think what they presented on screen was more than enough.A reviewer I saw on TV recently wanted to know 'why has Hollywood taken a thirty year step back to make such plotless films?' So, the golden age of cinema is dead, then, yes? All Hollywood churns out is putrid re-hashes of old ideas and that's it, yes? And as for no plot, I really don't think the film can be accused of that. It sets itself up nicely and travels through to an excellent and deserved conclusion. No passion? No heroism? If you cannot see that on the screen then the cynic in you is obviously your strongest trait.My own personal view is this - Gladiator stirred something in me that I have not felt in a long time. It dealt with personal pain and revenge and did not get fouled up by modern-day values and twenty-first century political correctness. It even portrayed the Roman Empire as the preferrable alternative to the barbarians throughout the known world, even showed their belief system and that it actually worked for them. In short, Gladiator was an honest film that simply laid out the details and told you how it was. I loved it for everything it was and everything it gave to me. Many people's views I have read have basically enlarged a single aspect of the film they didn't like. People are so cynical these days.",Null,0,0,18 May 2000
