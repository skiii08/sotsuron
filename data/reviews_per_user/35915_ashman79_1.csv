The Legend of Bagger Vance," A memorable film. A great drama with humor.
","This film was great. I was fortunate to see it as a sneak preview. It is a great drama with a lot of wit and humor. The trailer I saw play up the drama side of it more than the film itself presents it. Will Smith and Matt Damon were excellent in their roles. Charlize Theron did fairly well at acting a southern lady. Though the story is about golf, I don't think someone has to know a lot about it to view and understand the movie. The story held me all the way through and had many points of suspense that made the movie exciting. It kind of reminded me of Forrest Gump.",9,0,1,29 October 2000
