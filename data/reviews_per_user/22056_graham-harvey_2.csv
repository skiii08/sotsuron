Deepwater Horizon," Great to see this film made
","I would have given this film an 8, but given the subject matter and that BP so negligently failed in their responsibilities along with others, to lead to this disaster and how important this story is to be told, I give it a 9. Unless you avoid news, you will know about the oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico 2010.Besides the loss of life on the rig, the impact on life in the gulf has been incredibly bad and will continue to be so for a long time. When corporations are given too much freedom to manage themselves, such a disaster unfolds. How many birds and fish and other life was destroyed ? and then the impact on all kinds of people whose livelihood depended on the region being in a clean state. This is an excellent film for all to see, young & old as a reminder of why government needs to do its job and keep things managed.",9,0,1,28 August 2017
Life," Not a bad story
","A little bit similar to alien. Bringing back a dangerous organism, except this time, no conspiracy. Someone does not follow protocol, and allows life from Mars, to begin growing at the ISS, and before long the evil human munching life has got out of control, killing off crew. It is a gripping story to the end. Great effects and very holding attention all the way through. But I want to see less fear mongering, and some films about great advances from contact being made with friendly aliens. There is much potential. Why is it that alien films almost always have an attack focus on humans?",7,2,4,28 August 2017
