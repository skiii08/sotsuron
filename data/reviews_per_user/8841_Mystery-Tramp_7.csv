Minority Report," Fun, but flawed
","Steven Spielberg directing. Tom Cruise starring. And a Philip K.Dick short story as the backbone. You'd think 'Minority Report'would be fantastic. Although the movie is an enjoyable thriller, theplot's so creaky that by the time it reaches the conclusion, you feelcompelled to cut off a couple of points.(Since I'm coming to this late, I'll assume everyone knows thebasics of the plot and avoid a recap.)The greatest sin of the movie is the number of subplots thrown atthe viewer which are then discarded like used tissues. Forexample, Cruise is being bird-dogged by an FBI agent who seemscommitted to bringing down the whole 'precrime' enterprise. Theagent wants to get inside the 'temple' where Precrime keeps the'precogs.' Can't do that, Cruise insists. It would contaminate theblah blah blah (some technobabble better left forgotten).The agent says he's got a warrant and he'll enter anyway. (I guessby 2054, cops don't need probable cause of a crime to get awarrant.) Any further word about this contamination ruining theprecogs' work? Nope.Then there's a meeting midway through the movie between Cruiseand a back-alley plastic surgeon. The surgeon and Cruise havesome history ... which ultimately has nothing to do with the plot.And the surgeon floats a don't-do-that-or-you'll-go-blind plotelement that gets ignored for the rest of the movie.The climax involves a scene with Cruise and the antagonist. Itseems to revolve around the central issue of the movie: Must wecarry forward a prescripted destiny or do we have control over ourown fates? A deep, deep issue. Unfortunately for the climax, it wasanswered 30 minutes earlier in the movie.All this wouldn't be so annoying if Steven Spielberg weren't thedirector. Did he do this movie just to get someone to stopbothering him? Maybe all his movies have a hundred nits to pick,but these plot holes seemed the most glaring -- and detractedfrom what was otherwise a fun thriller.",8,0,0,23 December 2002
The English Patient," Ugh
",Let me get this straight: It's a movie about an overprivileged Eurotrash playboy who sells out the free world just so he can get the corpse of his adulterous girlfriend.Then get gets horribly injured and finds love only because he's covered in gauze and plaster of paris so the nurse can't tell what he's really like.Have I missed something?,1,8,19,9 August 2001
Cast Away," The movie was far deeper than I expected
","I'm not sure why this movie has such a low rating on IMDB -- 7.5 as I write this. The movie is far better than that, easily one of my all-time favorites. Granted, I like Tom Hanks and most of his bad movies are better than a lot of people's best.But what I liked the most about the movie was the simple imagery, particularly the angel wings and the closing shot. That last shot might have seemed heavyhanded to some, but I thought it was near perfect.And I really liked how the story was told, how they let four years go by and how what happened during those four years became important to the end. That was fairly deft storytelling.The imagery and the storytelling added up to a story that was far more than just a 21st century rewrite of Robinson Crusoe. It's a movie I continue to think about two weeks after seeing it on video. That's a sign of something.Lots of people have commented on Tom Hanks acting. I'll just say he remains one of my favorite actors.",10,0,0,2 July 2001
American Beauty," Grossly over-rated
","So much started out right for 'American Beauty' but the ending destroys what should be an emotional wallop. Kevin Spacey breaks down, then rebuilds himself into a fascinating mensch. Annette Bening is more than just over-driven -- she has her own issues to contend with. Together, the climax, where these two should confront their very different lives, should be amazing film-making. Instead, the movie veers off into a 'homophobia is bad' message picture. It turns out to be a simplistic theme for such a richly textured flick. I was greatly disappointed.",1,0,4,4 June 2000
Ocean's Eleven," A bit disappointing
","Maybe my expectations were too high, but 'Ocean's Eleven' wasn't near as good as I'd hoped. The trouble with con movies is that the audience needs to be conned. And the ultimate con isn't quite so ultimate. Maybe you don't see the end coming, maybe you do, but I didn't much care. It's not The Sting.",6,0,1,3 February 2002
Pearl Harbor," Fairly well done
","When PH came out, I thought I read somewhere about the differences between it and 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' Funny, but the stories mesh fairly well. Both include the African-American cook who heroically climbs into an anti-aircraft gun to defend his shipmates (in PH he's a central character; in TTT he's just a few seconds of film). Both focus on the bomb that sank the Arizona. Both focus on what the U.S. might have known in advance of the attack.TTT has a more documentary feel, and as such, its information seems more reliable. PH has much greater visuals.And PH tries to graft a love story onto history. I thought James Cameron pulled it off well in Titanic. Here, the love story seems out of place. In Titanic, the DeCaprio-Winslet tryst was functional to the plot -- it led the viewer to all parts of the mighty ship. The PH love triangle does little more than add a little spice to what would otherwise be a heckuva film. Or maybe without the triangle, the movie becomes TTT.But what I think PH does better than TTT is in visualizing the heroism of the soldiers, sailors and nurses who were under attack. You can't walk away from Pearl Harbor without a deep, abiding respect for the men and women of World War II.",7,0,2,23 December 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Wonderful
","I love the Coen Brothers' movies -- The Hudsucker Proxy and Raising Arizona are two of my favorites. They seem to be able to create a movie I've never seen before. Here, the story of Everett, Pete and Delmar may be taken from Homer's Odyssey, but the three are lovingly original as they travel through Mississippi during the Depression.Clooney has become one of my favorite actors. He was great in Three Kings and The Peacemaker. He even made a respectable Batman. He's great here, too.",9,0,0,2 September 2001
