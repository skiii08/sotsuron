The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The usual from Summit
","I went in expecting the usual f'ery from Melissa Rosenberg and that is exactly what Summit delivered again. Best lines from the book omitted...inane scenes and dialog added...Bella never ever looks happy, even when she is getting exactly what she wants. I did love her wedding dress, the cottage on Isle Esme, and the ending of the movie. The inclusion of the wedding toasts was completely stupid, who does that? Were they supposed to be drunken rants? OMG, when Jacob broke from Sam's pack was cringe- inducing laughable. Bill Condon should be ashamed, really. If they wanted to put some humor into the drama, why not put in the Rosalie vs. Jacob banter. The dog dish, the blonde jokes...now that was funny.The hair and makeup team must have passive-aggressive tendencies. How else can you explain how such gorgeous actors have been made to look so awful? That is where Catherine Hardwick excelled, she let the sexy shine through and really made this group of actors something that fans wanted to see. I weep for Carlisle's flat red hair in this movie.I had hoped that Stephenie's presence on the set may have kept the story more focused. Giving her face time at the wedding was kinda cute but it immediately took me out of the movie. I am a full fledged Twitard so I will go to BD 2 regardless but my love for the saga remains for the books, not the movies. Summit earns less of my hard earned cash with each crappy adaptation that they offer up.",5,7,14,19 November 2011
