Iron Man 3," IM3 combines the thrills of a big summer romp with the craftsmanship of a prestige studio picture.
","WOW! IM3 combines the thrills of a big summer romp with the craftsmanship of a prestige studio picture. Thank you Shane Black! It's not simple popcorn fun although it certainly works in that capacity but it's as complex as its conflicted protagonist. It's a slickly engineered special-effects extravaganza with a saucy sense of humor that's well-acted and masterful at every turn.Most jaded critics dislike big Hollywood stuff that's hyped so much and will look for any reason to hate on a big film. Any negative Iron Man 3 reviews stem mostly from that fact and Avenger blow-back. No worries, it's a great film. Those jaded critics should stick to their little films about art-house global warming crusaders or Iranian kids and leave the truly great films to real movie fans.",Null,0,3,3 May 2013
Underworld Awakening," bloody video game film
","This was pretty much the bloody video game type of film that I was expecting. Kate is always great in skin tight leather (so disappointed in the no skin thaw out scene, however). I just wish the writers didn't write down or talk down to the audience so much at every turn. Maybe their main clientèle are morons but having the audience sort through a few nuances isn't the worst thing in the world. They spelled EVERYTHING out and it wasn't exactly a complicated plot. The CGI was pretty bad but the action was quite good. Shallow, messy, near nonsensical but fun... just what we all come to expect from the Underworld series! PS-Is it me or are they ripping off Marvel comics with every concept in this film? X-23, Days of Future Past, Werewolf Hulk mixed with Blade... nothing original at all.",Null,3,7,24 January 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Wonderful Escapist Fare
","When I first heard that Captain America was being brought to the screen I cringed. How could they translate the complexity of character and his true coolness but stay away from any cheese? Dress a guy in the flag and remain true to the seriousness of the Depression and World War Two era? Well, they managed to pull it off almost perfectly! The director knew that you had to establish and truly care about the character before he was transformed. He spends valuable screen time establishing his characters and the universe but does so with style and with heart. Making it a period piece really helps give it a flavor unlike any other comic adaptation. The director worked on Raiders of the Lost Ark and it shows. If you could compare Captain America to any film, it would be that one. Everything established early pays dividends, allowing the action to flow but also allowing for better development of the plot. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film that's just flat out exceptional.",Null,68,137,20 July 2011
Captain America: Civil War," Wonderful Escapist Fare and a GREAT Film
","Way back when I first heard that Captain America was being brought to the screen I kind of cringed. How could they translate the complexity of character and his true coolness but stay away from any cheese? Dress a guy in the flag and remain true to the seriousness of the Depression and World War Two era? Well, they managed to pull it off quite well in the first film. The director knew that you had to establish and truly care about the character. Making it a period piece really helps give it a flavor unlike any other comic adaptation. The Raiders of the Lost Ark flavor was there. In the second film, they met the new challenge of depicting Cap in the modern era. Now, everything established in both Captain America films and both Avengers pays BIG dividends in this Civil War movie. The universe has been established wonderfully and this film does the best job to date playing in that universe. Everything and every scene packs some sort of punch and resonates with true style and heart. They really let the action flow but also allow for key development of the overall story and over concept. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. And I'm talking ALL the characters even the ones with smaller roles. This heightens the tension, so often missing from lesser comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. Add more than a dash of thriller aspects and a few new characters that steal every scene that they appear in. I honestly can't think of one way to improve this film. The result is a sequel that's just flat out exceptional and a trilogy that's the best any genre has ever seen.",Null,1,5,20 May 2016
Thor," A Thundering Triumph!
",The first blockbuster of 2011 may be the best. They certainly set the bar very high. It's an exciting and certainly an all-around entertaining comic book adaptation. Nothing in this genre since LOTR has been any better. Everyone involved in the production should be proud to know that their movie can stand toe-to-toe with the likes of anything else that summer can throw at them.They found the perfect combination of spectacle and guts and passion balanced with the human dynamic of the character. It delivers mind-bending visuals but it still very intelligent and thrilling. How many summer films can you say that about that you've seen over the past ten years or so???? The actors REALLY brought the characters to life. It was really amazing to see it develop on the big screen. There's no doubt that Hemsworth is a star in the making and a rather astounding leading man. Thor is a dazzling example of the superhero movie done right. There were some parts in the movie where I was just blown away. This film has a depth that no one could have expected and is very impressive in scale and design.I love how the movie played out and it exceeded all my expectations. This was by far the adventure movie I've seen in years. Not too many movies continue to have character growth from start to finish but still pack in the action and heart.,Null,237,472,20 April 2011
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Unremarkable in every way but not bad
","It may be that I've grown jaded to CGI 'epic' and sweeping tales but I found this movie to be almost completely unremarkable in every way. There's nothing wrong or bad on display it's just that I felt no real connection to any character even after three long drawn out films. I also was never awed by any single action scene with one exception. That exception being Legolis' dispatching of a rather nasty Orc on the crumbling bridge. The effects and computer generated images all played rather false and shallow mostly because of overuse. Everything felt CGI unlike the original trilogy. Overall, I'd label this movie tolerable but severely lacking in entertainment value. The lack of emotional depth given run times is baffling but one exchange at the end of the film does hit a chord 'Why does it (love) hurt so much?' Answer: 'Because it was real.' The movie needed more lines and writing like that and far less CGI monster beheadings.",Null,1,4,19 December 2014
The Wolverine," Hugh Jackman is the PERFECT Wolverine. GREAT film!
","The Wolverine is a movie that manages to carve a smarter, fresher niche in the genre that Fox has had trouble reaching before now. It's a wonderful character study first and a great adventure film second. I applaud this smarter approach.In this film we finally get to see the depth of character that makes Logan one of Marvel's best all-around anti-heroes. I'm not one of those crybabies that hated the Origins movie but I always felt they could have done better with the character. Wolverine deserves better than any '7/10 not bad' movie. Well, Logan FINALLY gets a high caliber pay off with this film.A true movie first, Wolverine is the most entertaining film of the summer season because it plays it just right. It didn't try to jump on the dark film bandwagon just for the sake of playing with grim emotions. The balance and depth it finds makes it a special film and what results was a true joy to watch on its own. Honestly, other releases this summer have disappointed because they couldn't deliver intelligence or heart with their characters. Wolverine should have patrons intrigued and enthused as they savor a movie done right. It's a perfect balance of intensity, pathos and action. It's the story that only Logan in Japan could deliver and it's as close as we've seen to getting the Logan from the books.I don't expect any movie version to become the literary version because you really can't compete with 40 years of character development and you also can't make any movie figure an unstoppable killing machine. Yet, they come very close. As a fan, I did have a problem with the character's power level in the movie franchise. He seemed to get KO'd so easily in the trilogy. Sabretooth KO'd him (for hours?) with one swing from a tree branch. Magneto KO'd him on the train by slamming him in to the back wall. Also, a single regular (non-adamantium) bullet to the forehead sends him down in X2. They make Logan tougher and formidable in this film yet they flip it all and make him vulnerable. This adds texture and ups the stakes. Thus, it makes the film so much more intense and enjoyable. Hugh Jackman is the PERFECT Wolverine and now maybe certain fanboys will be forced to acknowledge just that fact. For those of us that already enjoyed his work, this film is a special treat because it's the best the character has ever looked and been portrayed in live action.",Null,15,30,25 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," TDKR hits FAR down the genre charts and ends the trilogy on a low note
","Sad to say but this movie falls into the abyss of most summer movies - excellent advertising for an at-best mediocre product. Who saw that one coming? Just think, some people thought they could follow TDK without Ledger and that it would be just as good. If that's the case, then they are in for a HUGE let down. TDKR makes Spider-Man 3 look like Casablanca by comparison. Yes, Spider-Man 3 did the same thing that TDKR does here. It reached too far to tie loose ends and jammed too much in to the film. Yet, Spider-Man 3 honestly did it better. That's no joke, TDKR has all the flaws of Spider-Man 3 without its action strengths. TDKR hits FAR down the genre charts and ends the trilogy on a low note for the most part. Such a shame that even a Nolan led production couldn't avoid the curse of the terrible third movie.TDKR offers nothing new in any way, shape or form. It's a convoluted mess that's caught in no man's land. It actually takes itself too seriously yet offers ridiculous action (ridiculous as in dumb, not as in wild or fun) and even more ridiculous characters. It wants to be taken seriously like TDK managed to deliver but functions in bizarre surroundings with a foolish plot. Movies like TDK and most efforts from Marvel work because they develop characters, tell a smart story by grounding the concept and still deliver the action. This movie tries to take a similar approach but it simply can't stand on its own as a film. Will the fondness for the past two films mask the terrible failure that hits the screen here? Will dumb and chaotic appeal to even the youngest crowds or the biggest Nolan fans? Maybe it does but the rest of us want way more in our summer movies.",Null,1,3,21 July 2012
