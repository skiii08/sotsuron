It," Movie by 10 year old's for 10 year old's
","The movie started off good but failed to keep up the momentum. The mystery and horror elements were missing from the movie script. Movie is good enough to scare kids and it also contain teachings for them at the end. The character of the monsters was not revealed enough. I understand the monsters if to be feared with but it should have a little background story at least. And the worst part was the ending, They made the monster almost helpless against those kids. The monster was to be feared with but someone you can scare away with your friends. If you are planning to watch the movie , you can take your kid to it. Its not frightening at all and your kid might learn a few things about friendship and stuff.",6,0,2,6 October 2017
The Mummy," Good Action Adventure
",I remember seeing this movie in the early 2000's on rented DVD. Movie is a complete entertainer in terms of action and adventure. There is non stop action till the very end. The story line and plot are mildly interesting if you are into ancient Egypt and mummy sorts of things. Acting have done their job very pretty well. CGI are at par with that time. You can watch it one fine evening if you are in mood for a India Jones type movie.,8,5,5,13 October 2017
The Usual Suspects," Brilliant Thrill and Mystery
",The movie is one of the best thrillers. The script and direction of the movie were great. Kevin Spacey gave an outstanding performance. The execution of the script was so awesome that it will keep to glued to the screen. All the actors have played their part beautifully. The best part about the movie is the ending. You could have never ever guessed the ending. Overall its a great thriller to watch anytime.,9,0,1,8 October 2017
