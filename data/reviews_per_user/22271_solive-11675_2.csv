Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Villian
","I think that the phantom menace is about how all the characters got in the fourth star wars movie together. For an example how r2d2 got to anakin or how cp3o got built. Though it might not have too much story to tell, it's a pretty decent movie. The only flaws that the movie has in my opinion is the political argument. It says about what is in the law and what isn't. Another flaw is Darth Maul. Darth Maul only fights twice. And I get that he isn't the main character, but still. I would love to see him in the second movie. An example is Dooku he appeared in the second and the third movie. But that's not the end. Jar Jar Binks is so annoying that it nearly killed me literally. Also the cgi is awful but I'll make i exception because of the 1990's . Over all the movie is normal.",5,0,2,30 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A whole essay for wrong things about DISNEY
","First of all how did the emperor come back. It said that he was cloned but still it hardly explains how.
Second of all, the prophecy in 1, 2, 3 star wars movies is ruined. It said that Anakin skywalker was the jedi to restore the balance and destroy the sith. Well in the 6th movie Anakin/Darth vader destroys the emperor and the prophecy is restored. But when the emperor comes back it ruins the prophecy that anakin is the chosen one.
Third of all, the movie is too much of a fast pace. One second you're on one planet and the other you're on another planet.
Fourth of all the movie is too simple. The movie is basically Rey and Kylo Ren try to race to the planet where the emperor is and Rey finds some difficulties along the way with her friends, and then the good side wins.
Fifth of all, Rey is too OP. Even Luke and Anakin lose their battles with proper training, but Rey never loses.
Sixth of all, why didn't Ben skywalker appear as a force ghost. Darth vader was evil but then turned good and appeared as a force ghost. The same thing happened with Kylo Ren and he didn't appear as a force ghost.
Seventh of all, the side characters like CP3o and BB-8 plus chewbacca are rarely mentioned in the movie.",1,16,23,30 April 2020
