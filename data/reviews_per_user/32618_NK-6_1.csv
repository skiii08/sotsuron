The Blair Witch Project," Great movie but doesn't completely deliver
","'The Blair Witch Project' is a true stand-out in a sea of formulaic horror movies.  It scares with subtlety instead of in-your-face gore and special effects. The movie never quite achieves the creepiness that it is capable of, though. The constant bickering of the characters distracts from the building fear. If they had started the film getting along well and then degenerated to being at each others throats, it would have emphasized the rising tension. It was a great idea that didn't quite deliver the goods.",Null,0,2,19 August 1999
