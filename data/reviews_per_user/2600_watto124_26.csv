Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Extremely overblown effort. Very Disappointing.
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS: The good news is that there is at least one interesting character in this movie that actually has personality. The sad news is that he's a gambling slave owner. Yes, you heard me right. Watto is the best character in The Phantom Menace, the first movie in the Star Wars saga. The strange thing is, this is supposed to be thirty years before A New Hope, and the creatures are more life-like, the ships are faster, there's more dramatic battles, and there's whole armies of droids that are much badder than the Stormtroopers. This sounds more like Episode 101, doesn't it? The effects are overblown and there is an extreme over-reliance on CG effects than there is story. The acting is absolutely terrible. It's kinda sad to see all these good actors not even try to make something out of an already crappy script. One more thing: Jar Jar sucks.6/10",6,0,1,26 July 2001
Unbreakable," An unforgettable, Unbreakable, masterpiece
","One absolutely beautiful film! Mind boggling camera work, story- telling, acting, and atmosphere make this film simply angelic. The director, M. Night Shyamalan, is getting good. REAL good! Some elements from his opus 'The Sixth Sense' can be seen throughout the film, only better! I recommend this movie to anyone out there who appreciates good, slow, atmospheric, Kubrickian-style works of art.",10,1,2,28 June 2001
Fight Club," What does everyone see in this movie?
","Don't get me wrong, Fight Club is extremely worth watching and is always entertaining, but I've seen the film 3 times now and I still don't see what all the fuss is about. I mean Edward Norton is awesome, and the first hour of this film is first- rate, but it wouldn't suffice to say this film goes over the top, into the sky, into orbit, and dies in a super nova of endless surrealistic imagery and crazy dialogue. POSSIBLE SPOILERS: I thought the surprise twist/ending was very well executed and very cool. But after we find out the truth the film goes on for another 20 or so minutes! This is definitely not the pinnacle of David Fincher's films. 'The Game' and Se7en' are masterpieces, and 'Alien3' is a great movie. I just don't really like the film or the ending to Fight Club where they just stop everything.            Or maybe I just don't get it. 10/10",7,0,2,28 August 2001
Akira," Awesome, brilliant, and wonderfully crafted.
","I'm not a big anime fan, but I have to say that this movie rocks! I went out and bought the new DVD yesterday because it looked very promising and I always wanted to see it. To put it mildly, it certainly went beyond my expectations. I was thinking this was a Star Wars type of flick and it turned out to be thought-provoking, long, and extremely serious. The violence isn't that bad. I don't know what everyone is thinking. Sure, it has its share of graphic content, but it's really nothing more than you get from a Schwarzenegger movie. My only gripe about this film though is that they tried to put too much into 2 hours of film. We get a little too much stuff going on. But hey, who really cares???        10/10",10,0,1,26 July 2001
Memento," One of the most ingenious films ever devised!
","Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' anything but mediocre. It is the most beautiful, poetic, and strangely told thriller I've ever come across. Some people are probably not going to like 'Memento' because of its overwhelming complexity. But the fact that it is so hard to follow is part of the point. Nolan made an effort to allow an audience to be able to tap into the mind of a person with short-term memory loss and be just as confused as Leonard Shelby, the protagonist with the strange condition. He does this, as everybody knows, by telling the film backwards, though all the clues are laid out for you and characters are introduced to you like you're watching a regular movie. Amazing. And of course, an amazing concept like this calls for equally amazing actors to carry the story. And they more than rise to the occasion. No one could've done a better job than Guy Pearce. He is simply spectacular. As is Joe Pantoliano, who brings a charismatic comic relief to the piece (which is certainly needed). And Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job of changing your perceptions of a character just by adding more facial expressions. This movie is perfect, innovative, and down right awesome! 10/10",10,0,1,26 May 2002
12 Monkeys," What A Wonderful World. What a wonderful film.
","Beautifully made film. Terry Gilliam is a marvel. Bruce Willis is fantastic as well as the rest of the cast. Very memorable scenes are everywhere throughout. An extremely intriguing story that continues to unravel and thicken every minute. Sure it's a little dark, a little hard to follow the first time, and a little off-kilter pace wise, but this great movie is filmmaking at its best. No question. I cannot stress enough how much of a good movie 12 Monkeys really is. Bravo!      10/10",10,0,0,21 September 2001
X-Men," Why could'nt the rest of the movie be like the first 15 min!!!!????
","No character development.........cheesiness............ Stupid story.......yet i still thought it was alright when the midnight showing on July 13, 2000 was over....... Alright. So like Rogue and Wolverine were a pair of awesome characters. That was a major high point. The beginning of the film (the Holocaust scene) up until the first scene with Sabretooth in the snow I thought was mesmerising! The darkness of Wolverine at that fight club, the shyness of Rogue, the powerful Magneto-Holocaust scene. It all came down to a great start. Then we meet the other X-Men. Professor X was a dork, Storm was just ......well a dork! and Cyclops was the biggest 'DICK' of them all. I'm not saying i hated the movie. I'm not saying i loved the movie either. it was just...................ok....",5,0,0,16 July 2000
The Terminator," Great time-travelling fun!.........but not as good and dramatic as T2.....
","A great film, the Terminator packs a wallop as far as casting, acting, writing, and basically everything is concerned, but, however, the film suffers (mildly) from the cheap musical score (except the opening theme). Now, a very dramatic and serious pic such as this one should'nt have such bad synthesized music. But I understand that the film was made on an unbelievably small budget. The special effects are terrific, the story is ingeniuos, and AHNOLD is cooler than ever!",9,0,0,11 August 2000
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A hilarious guilty pleasure..........
","Dr. Strangelove is a comedy classic that should be in everybody's home video library. It's one of those rare films you can watch and watch over and over again. Peter Sellers is monumentally histerical as three major characters, all with their own unique personality and accents. George C. Scott is also hilarious as the General who, dislikes the Commies with a mortal passion. The movie goes over the top (in a good way) and is always funny throughout. I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen at a special screening of the film in June. Let me tell you, this one of the best films ever made! Bravo Kubrick!

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The worthy follow-up to 'Empire'
","The end of the Star Wars series, thankfully, isn't a bad one. Better than Episode 4, but not even close to Episode 5, Marquand's first and last excursion into the Star Wars universe explains much, entertains much, and ends the Star Wars Saga spectacularly and dramatically. The presence of the Ewoks never bothered me. I was fond of them from the start, and even more so when I laid eyes on Jar Jar. McDiarmid gives a wonderful performance as the Emperor, the special effects are better than the first two, and the story is told in a grandeur that is apparent in all the Star Wars films. Williams' score outdoes the originals' by a longshot, the 'Luke and Leia' theme is beautiful. The emotional impact is increased in this one because we need to settle things after the unsettling events of Episode 5. Luke confronts Vader, love blossoms between Leia and Han (now rescued), and Luke becomes a Jedi. The Saga may end with this one, but that sure is a beautiful way to die.  10/10",10,0,1,4 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Dark, dangerous and disturbing! Restores one's faith in the prequels, it does!
","Well, it looks like Ol' George hasn't lost it after all! 'Attack of the Clones' is pure Star Wars from beginning to end. It is lovely, dark, and can sometimes get a bit creepy. Those other critics don't know what the heck they're talking about. Take Roger Ebert, for example, who has panned 'Clones' but gave 'The Phantom Menace' an extremely positive review back in 1999. 'Menace' wasn't horribly atrocious, but it was too kiddy-friendly, had crappy acting, and a story and feel that just didn't feel like our beloved Star Wars. But now fans are rejoicing! Not only is there pretty good acting this time, but the movie is relentlessly dark, has a great story, and contains all the elements and formulas that made the old ones so awesome. It also has more Yoda.  Truly spectacular! Ewan McGregor has a young version of Alec Guiness down to a tee, Hayden Christensen has good facial expressions and seems to be trying hard most of the time. Natalie Portman is also better this time. The acting, though it CAN get a little poky is very satisfying overall. Everything in this one works, from the great settings (some will be all too familiar), to the truly astonishing CG work. There are also many treats for fans and surprising lead-ins for the original trilogy. I cannot stress more how much of an improvement 'Attack of the Clones' is from 'The Phantom Menace'. The Force is back! And certainly everyone should be excited!  10/10",10,0,0,18 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Shockingly triumphant! The BEST film of 2001! No question!
","December 18 was a pretty normal day for me to begin with. I looked in the paper and saw in the film listings that a midnight showing of 'The Fellowship of the Ring' would take place that evening. I quickly called people and asked if they would like to join me and they said, without hesitation, 'yes'. I bought six tickets in all, and the rest of my day was filled with anticipation. After arriving at approximately 11:15pm, I could tell this would be something special just from the quantity of people ready to set their eyes on a masterpiece. After 30 min. of trailers, the film began and there was an aura af astoundment and joy flowing through the dark room. Rare was a person that was fidgeting or going to the bathroom or concession stand or anything like that. The images on the screen startled the mind, and 3 quarters of the way through the film, you'd already gone through every emotion thinkable with it: anger, joy, love, sadness, excitement, amusement, everything. It is by this time, the first time you see the movie, you're overwhelmed by the eye candy, emotional intensity, adrenaline rushes during the action scenes, and best of all, the sweeping narrative and STELLAR acting. The cast could not have been so impeccable as this one. Let me just say that, if I had my way, EVERY cast member would earn an acting Oscar. Peter Jackson has made an engaging film that challenges, entertains, and best of all: tells a story. There is an equal balance of CGI and live effects in the film, so that seeing something spectacular doesn't seem boring. Shore's score is awesome, and the cinematography is positively astounding. In the theatre, when the credits rolled on the screen, everyone in the place was entranced by what they just saw, and everyone in the theatre was p****d they had a wait a year to see more. I could have not asked for a better movie! The best film of the year! SEE IT!! SEE IT AGAIN!! 10/10",1,0,3,19 December 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A juggernaut of a motion picture.
","'T2' is a first-rate film that fundamentally changed the way we looked at films ten years ago. It is a very emotional, very original, very worthy follow-up to the original 'Terminator'. In many ways, it's a better film than the first one, in that there is much more solidity and more elements and ingredients to make thirty movies. I prefer the Theatrical version over the Special Edition because the additions are so overwhelming that you think you have a film of tremendous scale that it is harder to watch and enjoy. The acting is wonderful, the story is insanely involving, the special effects are mind-boggling. James Cameron is a flat-uot filmmaking genius. Bravo! This film is one of few in the '90s that is going to last generations.            10/10",10,1,1,7 October 2001
Spider-Man," The best comic book adaption ever!
","Wonderful, colorful, and extremely well made, Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man' undertaking has proved its worth and some. It is a very satisfying vision of the comic book that stays very true to the source material. The story, characters, and overall feel of an actual comic book have never really been faithfully adapted to a motion picture until now. The acting is pitch-perfect as well, from Tobey Maguire's nearly heartbreaking portrayal of Peter Parker, to Kirsten Dunst giving Mary Jane a very insecure persona. And Willem Dafoe, of course, hams it up appropriately as Norman Osborn, whose hidden agenda is Spider-Man's arch-nemesis, the Green Goblin. The special effects sequences are truly a spectacle. They are thunderous, stunning races through Manhattan's concrete jungles that blur the line between CG images and reality. My only gripe about the movie is that it moves at a cheetah's pace, sometimes at the sacrifice of some of the movie's dramatic punch. But hey, that's excusable due to the fact that the film is based on  comic book, and shouldn't pretend it is based on Shakespeare. Another lame bit is the presence of Macy Gray, which for reasons I can't quite put my finger on, kind of detracts from the movie (though only in a small way). If she's gonna be in films she should stick to the stuff she did in 'Training Day'. But even with these two barely significant quirks, 'Spider-Man' is an exciting, and fantastic movie with awesome acting, characters, music, and special effects. Go se it, even if you just go for J.K. Simmons' hiarious performance as the liberal media tyrant J. Jonah Jameson. The movie is a thrilling experience and we can only hope that Raimi and company reunite for a sequel in the future. 10/10",10,0,0,4 May 2002
Aliens," The best film ever made.
","Aliens......The follow-up on Alien is the best film ever. The acting is magnificent, the story is spectacular, and the action sequences, aliens, musical score, and dialogue are all detailed to perfection. Sigourney Weaver is at her best. She was nominated for an Academy Award (she should have won) for her portrayal as Ripley. James Cameron's genius sequel to the 1979 shocker Alien is.......listen to me....I'm positively speechless! Anyway, the special effects and VERY likeable characters are the high points....... and there are no low points........",10,0,0,12 May 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Astonishing! A dazzling masterpiece!
","'The Two Towers' is every bit as good as 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. Why? Because it is pretty much the same movie. Stylistically, the movie hasn't changed from last year, and that's a good thing. It is just a continuation of the classic story, now with more characters and action, but the heart and purpose the same. People who didn't see last year's film are going to be hopelessly confused. Go rent it! The new characters in the film are truly great. Bernard Hill was wonderful as Theoden. Brad Dourif was simply a marvel to watch, and Miranda Otto was great too. Gollum is going down in cinema history as being the most realistic computer creation ever. The filmmakers could not have done a better job. I was stunned and shocked at how glorious he was. Andy Serkis is a genius. The Ents are also smashing. In the beginning they are the definition of cool, in the end they are the definition of killing machines. Quite something to behold, indeed! Like last year, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian McKellan, and Viggo Mortensen are terrific, as well as the rest of the cast. Shore has a sure score again in this one. There are also many simple and beautiful visual touches that add a lot of cinematographic artistic dimension to the piece. Of course the movie does have flaws. Much is lost from the book, the result being that the movie feels extremely unresolved. There just seems to be too much Peter Jackson is going to have to squeeze in for 'The Return of the King' next year. Also, there are many things that happen in the film that don't happen in the book at all. Some are really cool, and some are completely unnecessary. But still, overall, these are shaping up to be the movies of the century. These films are so good, they are positively going to stand the test of time. Keep up the good work, Peter! I'm breathless. 10/10",10,0,0,19 December 2002
The Game," Fincher's Best! An absolute masterpiece!
","One first-class thriller, 'The Game' manages to catch you and reel you in with surprise and suspense. POSSIBLE SPOILERS: A creative and suspenseful story and script centers around Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, a millionaire/investment banker living it up in San Francisco. He's a jerk. Plain and simple. Really mean. He's had an unhappy child hood (he saw his father kill himself) and is basically falling apart and losing focus. Mr. Douglas pulls this part off gloriously, by the way. Sean Penn is his 'interesting' brother who gives him a birthday present that sends Douglas into a spiral of madness.A 'Game' from a company called Consumer Recreation Services. What it does is makes a person's life more interesting by pulling off complicated tricks and pranks on its clients. After many crazy situations and embarrassments, Van Orton becomes a better person. And as it turns out, that's what 'The Game' is there for. What is interesting about Fincher's film, more than its ingenius story, is its style and feel. It is hard to grasp how amazingly everything boils down. The music consists of a high-pitched piano playing repetitious tunes which is just what Douglas is going through. Ficher's trademark colorizations are apparent throughout, mesmerizing characters and developments are there, too. The acting is great, full of hellacious outbursts and uncontrollable action. The movie pulls also enough dramatic punch for almost 5 average dramas, and the payoff is brilliant. This was easily up there with 'L.A Confidential' and 'Titanic' as one of 1997's best. Much better than 'Fight Club', this is the pinnacle of David Fincher's career with the amazing 'Alien3' and the profound 'Se7en'. What a ride! What a film! What a masterpiece!10/10",10,1,3,10 October 2001
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A great, fun, and addictive film.
","The first time I saw this movie back in 93', I didn't like it that much. Then, a year ago, I viewed it again and my eyes were opened to one of the most charming, catchy, fun, artistically brilliant films I've EVER seen. The animation is absolutely uncanny. It marvelously sets a mood that has no equal. Danny Elfman, one of my favorite composers, really busts his butt to pull the music and lyrics off and he succeeds gloriously. One of the most exquisitely composed movies of all time. I know 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is only an hour and fifteen minutes, but it certainly seem much longer than that. That is because there is not a dull moment in the whole movie. It dares not to take take a breath and slow down. Like the Energizer Bunny, it keeps going, and going, and going. I cannot stress enough how much eye candy the film contains. I wish I could have seen this on the big screen, it would have been quite a visual experience. Tim Burton's style is apparent throughout, and there's not much lame, sentimental, Disney-esque stuff in it. What is there is a small ozone layer of warmth that envelops the whole package and delivers an original, heart-warming, and visually breath-taking masterpice of cinema. It is, and will continue to be a classic of epic proportions. A masterpiece.       10/10",10,4,5,2 October 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," Beautiful, enigmatic entertainment.
","Quite possibly the best sci-fi film ever, 2001 is a lovely, poignant, strange, brilliant, gloriously made film of a great story. I'm sure a lot of people dislike this film because of its almost completely visual story-telling technique that leaves a lot people in a strange, curious stupor. A word of advice: READ THE BOOK if you don't know what the heck is going on. Anyway, the film is thought-provoking, ambitious, and enigmatic throughout. The effects still very much hold up today, Kubrick's choice of music throughout the film is awesome, and the set design and artsy-craftsy camera work still boggles the mind. There are some films that try to explain to much. That just gets on my nerves. 2001 has so much faith in the audience that it doesn't tell you what the heck is going on the screen. It leaves some work for the viewers to do. And I just love that.......................           10/10 (what else?)",10,0,1,29 July 2001
This Is Spinal Tap," Genius. Pure genius.
","If I had to pick a film that contains some serious talent, I'd pick this one without hesitation. Not only is this one of the most brilliant satires ever filmed, these guys actually wrote and performed ALL their own music! This had to be a labor of love. Tony Hendra is great as the manager of the band, and- actually, EVERYONE involved in ths picture is absolutely outstanding right down to the flawless camera work from the cinematographer. Everything is just so right and the film contains some of the most memorable lines ever. This is arguably Rob Reiner's best work. Sorry 'American President', 'Spinal Tap' is MUCH better. But hey, enough from me pop in the DVD of this movie and lets 'BOOGIE'!",10,0,1,9 September 2001
Halloween," It's all about atmosphere.
","You can cut the atmosphere of Halloween with a knife! It's slow moving, suspensful, and genuine. The simple, yet effective theme song is a real high point and so is the other creepy music by John Carpenter. Halloween is an all time classic with its subtleness, importances, beautifully done camera work, scares and it's originality, will be remembered as a milestone in the horror genre.",10,0,0,4 September 2000
Signs," Pure cinematic terror and fun!
","Shyamalan has done it again, this time with 'Signs', and I consider it to be his best effort. This undertaking proves to be much more entertaining than his other two endeavors, 'The Sixth Sense', and 'Unbreakable'. And although I loved these two films, 'Signs' surpasses them immeasurably. The basic plot is that a family living on a farm discover crop circles in their fields, the first of many bizarre occurances. Like a good episode of 'The Twilight Zone', the movie keeps the ambiguity flowing dramatically throughout. Mel Gibson is fantastic. The actor plays a man who seems always together, even when fantastic things are happening all around him. Joaquin Phoenix is good too. He is sort of where most of the comic relief comes from in the movie. That is another thing about the movie: it is very funny. Typically, movies that try to be funny AND scary end up being a big mess. 'Signs' is genuinely hilarious. But then it will turn around and be absolutely horrifying and sometimes disturbing. It succeeds. Many have complained about the film's religious undertones overwhelming the sci-fi premise. This simply is not true. The two themes go hand-in-hand with eachother as one story. Shyamalan has eased a bit off the artsy camera angles, something I kind of miss. The dialogue and characters are more realistic in 'Signs', and therefore makes your feelings for the people much stronger. Howard's music is not very versatile, but he has many variations of the theme and it is very effective and makes the movie even creepier. 'Signs' is probably the most pop-culture-friendly Shyamalan movie, but considering how good this one turned out, maybe the other two needed some of that. I loved this movie. Everything about it was lovely and entertaining. Heck, even the kids were excellent! I can't wait for M. Night's next project to crop up! 10/10",10,0,3,30 August 2002
The Sixth Sense," Insanely masterful
","Congrats to Mr. Shyamalan for constructing a cinematic work of art. Not only is the film entertaining, it is also engrossing and extremely intelligent. You can watch the film in two different dimensions. One, which only happens once, is the first time you see the film. Everything up until the end is basically an engrossing, yet somewhat trite thriller. The SECOND time however, your transported into another world basically as if you're watching a different movie than the first. Everything makes sense. The strange way Willis and Williams interact is masterfully explained. Religiously, the film doesn't have many boundaries, either. Uncanny acting, beautiful artistic camera techniques, smart writing, and an unusual, wonderful pace make 'The Sixth Sense' a must-see for anybody. Definitely a close second next to American Beauty for 1999.   10/10",10,0,0,23 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The most fun, but not the best.
","A New Hope is severely entertaining and is a lot of fun. Contains many dramatic battles and memorable one-liners that'll make you gasping for some relief. It was the first Star Wars film ever created and has withstood two generations of fans since its release back in '77. Though I think highly of it, this is NOT the bulk of the Star Wars universe. 10/10(what else?)",10,0,0,25 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A taste of film and imagination heaven.
","'The Empire Strikes Back', if not the best film ever made, is merely the best Star Wars film ever made. I seriously doubt Lucas will top this. Ever. The way the story is told continues to astound me. The darkness of it all. The adventure, danger, and drama that consists in the film's universe has yet to be paralelled (I don't it will be). In terms of acting, its pretty well orchestrated. In terms of special effects, it's amazing. In terms of music, it has some of Williams' best. In terms of script, it's wonderous (at least after the 'laser-brain' scene). In terms of story, it's the best. In terms of characters? Well, lets just say it's uncanny. The way the characters unfold in their adventures and the true revealing of Vader's mind is fascinating. The film won't please impatient kids all that much. It is a mature movie through and through. Not in terms of content, but in terms of understanding. There's no Jar Jar, Jawas, or Ewoks in this one. The title explains it all and the end result leaves one in a semi-depressed stupor while also giving the viewer a sense of hope. Everything works in this one somehow, whether it's the story, locations, characters (Boba Fett and Yoda, for example), music, or awesomesness of the villains. It all accumulates into one word: fantastic.    10/10!",10,0,0,4 November 2001
Beetlejuice," A true classic. One of Burton's best.
","'Beetlejuice' is a very original film, one that truly showcased Burton's potential as a stylistic director. Michael Keaton kinda steals the show as the one-liner encyclopedia Beetlegeuse. The supporting cast is excellent as well, including Catherine O'Hara as the New Yorker wife who 'must express herself' in a house that, to her, could use a little blowtorch. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are worthy protagonists and are actually quite funny. This movie delivers the goods on an amazing level. Whether it's the humorous and novel story, the hilarious cast's efforts, the wonderful music, true Burton-esque set design, or the fact that there has never been a movie quite like this, you always get a kick out of it!   10/10",10,1,2,20 October 2001
