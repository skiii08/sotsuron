Spartacus," 'They Were Just Slaves ...'
","Along with 'The ten Commandments', 'Ben Hur', 'Quo Vadis', 'El Cid' and perhaps some other one this film stands as one of the best spectacular epics of the genre's golden age back in the 50's and early 60's. In spite of some inaccurate historical events (Spartacus died in battle and was not crucified, for instance) director Stanley Kubrick clearly succeeds in transmitting the spirit of the Tracian gladiator's famous revolt against the powerful Roman republic in search for freedom, that became a myth.Kirk Douglas if not rendering a perfect performance all along the film deliveries his incredible and magnetic screen personality and fits perfectly as Spartacus. Laurence Olivier handles easily his role as the arrogant and ambitious Crassus in love with Rome and himself. Charles Laughton (as populist senator Graccus), Peter Ustinov (as the gladiators training school owner Bathiatus) and pretty Jean Simmons Varinia (Spartacus woman) conform a really impressive and strong cast. Tony Curtis as the poet slave and Charles McGraw as the tough gladiator's trainer are very convincing too. Perhaps the weak link in this aspect is John Gavin's young Julius Caesar, too wooden and definitely lacking the 'phisic du rol' (Ceasar was not a tall man and he was bold already in his youth). Nina Foch, Woody Strode, Harold Stone, John Ireland and mainly Herbert Lom as the treacherous sylesian pirate Tigranes Levanto complete a high quality supporting cast.Good action and battle scenes, lots of extras (no computers back then) perfect settings, well designed gowns and armors and a powerful and accurate musical score by Alex North are also highlights in this great movie.A true classic in its genre!",9,1,3,31 October 2006
Casablanca," A True Classic Without Any Doubt
","There's not much to say about 'Casablanca' that hasn't been said already. However this film made Bogart a myth, Bergman a major star, Rains an everyone's favorite and a song an all time classic.The sequence in Rick's Cafe when Victor Laszlo asks the band to play the 'Marseillese' against the Nazi officer's singing of a German sort of military tune is deeply touching and one of the most remembered scenes ever in a film.'Casablanca' remains as one of the greatest drama-romance-War World II settled films ever made even that time has gone by for more than 60 years. Unmatched yet.",9,3,4,3 October 2006
Se7en," A Cruel Film But a Very Good One
","I can't recall watching a film as cruel, hard and impressive as 'Seven'. But I think that in this case if the movie had been 'softer' it would have lost impact and intensity.Definitely a thriller, 'Seven' is about the chasing of a serial killer who brutally murders his victims in a sort of punishment for each one's different capital sin. The film is very well conducted by director David Fincher and it is 'catching' right from the start. Good sort of pale color that helps the atmosphere, well handled action sequences and terrible crime scenes (though they help here to understand how completely out of his mind the killer is).Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are both good as the policemen in charge of the case, and Gwynneth Paltrow is a good support with a more important role than it seems.If you like suspense films and can stand some real hard scenes and a devastating finale, don't miss this one. Most enjoyable in its genre.",7,0,0,30 September 2006
12 Angry Men," Excellent !
","+++++ POSSIBLE SPOILERS +++++'Twelve Angry Men' is the perfect demonstration that when you have a good script, an intelligent director an a well selected cast a film doesn't have to be expensive or spectacular to be a real good one. This film is all about dialogues and acting and is set 95% in a small room yet its most entertaining and has a lot of tension.When I said it had a well selected cast I didn't mean an all star cast; Henry Fonda was the only major star; Lee Cobb, Ed Begley, Martin Balsam and E.G. Marshall where very talented supporting actors but not stars; Jack Warden and Jack Klugman weren't even known much in films yet. But a simple direction by Sidney Lumet leaving the development to the script and actors performances worked well and the film is tense, intriguing and most entertaining from beginning to end.'Twelve Angry Men' is a 'trail film' but with a very original focusing since by following the jury's debate the whole case is clearly revealed up to the verdict. It's also interesting that the verdict is not based in a not guilty conviction by the jurors but for the benefit of the doubt, which means that perhaps the boy actually killed his father.One of the best movies I've ever seen in its genre.",8,4,5,14 October 2006
The Caine Mutiny," A Very Good Film on men at War and Their Miserys
","When the USS Caine's Captain shows some sort of mental disorder that puts the ship in danger during a typhoon the second in command officer takes over command and faces a court martial for mutiny. Such is in a few words the story based on Herman Wouk's famous novel brought to the screen skillfully by director Edward Dmytryk.'The Caine Mutiny' turned to be a very good film that could be divided in two parts: the first one at sea where Commander Queeg (Humphrey Bogart) develops his emotional instability due to past stressing war actions that made him a sick man and his officers debate on what the correct decision should be; the second one deals with the Court Martial that Lt. Meryk (Van Johnson) has to face for taking over the ship's command. Both put together add to make this most interesting movie complete.A highlight of the film is the very well selected cast. Bogart delivers a fine performance as the troubled Quegg very different from most of his other appearances in the screen. Van Johnson is good as the officer who has to make the big decision knowing what the consequences can be for him. Josè Ferrer shows his undeniable acting class as Johnson's attorney. But what really surprised me was Fred MacMurray's outstanding acting as the selfish and unreliable Lt. Tom Kieffer who encourages the mutiny but lacks the guts to sustain his position in Court; I never thought of MacMurray as much more than a correct actor but somehow he manages to build here a classic performance, probably his best ever. The scene where a drunk Ferrer confronts him for his behaviour and throws his drink at his face is memorable.The romantic affair between Robert Francis (one of the Caine's young officers) and May Wynn doesn't do much for the movie but it doesn't hurt it either.All in all, this is good cinema and a must enjoyable film to see every once in a while.",8,0,0,10 October 2006
The Untouchables," ' Team Work ! '
","Though not a masterpiece in my opinion, this is a good crime film focused on Al Capone's chase by Elliot Ness and his men. Brian de Palma gets a fine entertaining product with a meticulous direction and a well created atmosphere of the 20's and early 30's in Chicago when Capone was at his peak. The film has tension, the action sequences are well handled and the musical score -though somewhat odd- fits enough.Kevin Costner is correct as Elliot Ness but the acting 'coup de force' is between Sean Connery (as Malone) and Robert de Niro (as Capone), both outstanding in their characters; de Niro is perhaps the best in a role that has had excellent performers in pictures such as Rod Steiger, Ben Gazzara and Jason Robards. Good jobs too from Andy Garcìa and Charles Martin Smith as Costner's sidekick lawmen. Billy Drago looks mean enough as Frank Nitti.The famous sequence at the train station (baby and stairs included) is not a highlight to me for I found it definitely too slow and long and the same with the sequence when Ness goes after Nitti at he Court House. Clear overrunning of some particular sequences is a usual characteristic in de Palma's films and no one knows why (Craig Wasson following Deborah Shelton through a mall in 'Body Double' and Angie Dickinson and the man at the art museum in 'Dressed to Kill', both being perfect examples).But all in all 'The Untouchables' is a fine and enjoyable crime and gangsters movie. Worth watching indeed.",6,1,3,8 November 2006
Enemy at the Gates," An Amazing Film on World War II
","'Enemy at the Gates' is based on true facts that occurred during the siege of Stalingrad by the Germans during World War II. It shows the death duel between Russian top sniper Vassili Zaitsev and German top sniper Major Konig a most interesting confrontation indeed through the city in ruins.But what really amazed me in this picture is the incredible atmosphere obtained by the not so prolific director Jean-Jacques Annaud as he did before in 'the Name of the Rose' with that unforgettable sordid and remote medieval monastery somewhere in the Italian mountains. I don't remember a film that shows so perfectly -if this could be possible- the horror, miseries, nonsense and heroism at war than 'Enemy at the Gates' (perhaps 'Saving Private Ryan' action sequences were close).If you like war films you can't miss it and if you don't its worth a watch too.Just for the record: in Argentina 'Enemy at the Gates' was renamed as 'Enemigo al Acecho' (something like 'The Stalking Enemy').",8,0,1,5 December 2006
Psycho," Hitchcok's Masterpiece
","Psycho starts as a common 'black' movie with our heroine Marion (Janet Leigh)stealing us$ 40.000 from his boss for sentimental reasons. Her run ends up at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman (Anthony Perkins) and his sick mother. All of a sudden she is smashed to death in the famous shower scene, no more than 40 minutes after that start. Then we realize we have entered in a completely different kind of movie: a sordid Thriller with a surprising 'finale' much like a horror film. Hitchcock carries the picture perfectly and it makes complete sense at the end. Back in 1960 double personality movies where not common and many appeared after Psycho (Dressed to Kill, as the outstanding example),but none could get even close to the original. Interest is kept all along and the music score is perfect too. As for the cast, it could not be better. Leigh proved for the first time she could really act and did well after Psycho. Vera Miles also grew as an actress after Psycho, and John Gavin was correct (unusual in him). John McIntyre and Martin Balsam make great supporting. As for Perkins there can be no doubt this was his best performance ever; in fact, you could say the film ruined his carrier because whenever you saw him after Psycho you could not help see Norman Bates. But on the other side, the role put him forever in films history. Saying that Psycho is Hitchcok's best picture shows clearly the huge size of this movie coming from a guy that made such classics as Rear Window, Dial M for Murder, North by Northwest and many others. Without a 'shadow of a doubt' Psycho is the best thriller ever made!",10,0,0,27 August 2006
Halloween," That Final Twist ...
","+++++++ THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS +++++++John Carpenter's 'Halloween' is no doubt a very good horror/thriller product. Right from the start little Michael Myers brutal murder of his own sister in Halloween night is quite shocking; and years later as he escapes his psychiatric imprisonment and comes back to town for more savage killings the film sustains its high tension and interest all along.My only complaint on this excellent film comes from the very end when Myers 'body' disappears in a sort of supernatural focus after being shot no less than five times by Donald Pleasence from no more than 10 feet away and falling out from a balcony. What I mean is that when it turns into something supernatural, the story looses credibility and all the fear the film transmits during its running time -and it surely does- sort of looses a bit of impact. I think that either Michael killed or escaped alive would have made a better finale. That aside, 'Halloween' is indeed a very good picture in its genre and the first kick for all those teenagers-chased-by-mysterious-murderers products such as 'Prom Night' and 'I Saw what You Did Last Summer' as a couple of examples, none of which came out better than this one.",7,1,2,11 December 2006
Paths of Glory," About Acting ... Adolph Menjou
","There's not much one can add here to what has been said regarding this excellent and classic War World I film based on actual facts.Perhaps just point out that in a brilliant cast (Kirk Douglas renders one of his best performances ever and George McReady his best), the one who steals the show is Adolph Menjou in my opinion.In his General Broulard character Menjou shows superb acting. He is a cynic and egocentric man who doesn't seem to care much about his men but a lot in his career and position, yet in his calm and at he same time strong manners he shows he will let some things pass but will not tolerate others. His meeting with Douglas while a party is going on downstairs is an acting class; he brilliantly avoids a serious conversation until he is told about MacReady's order to open fire against his own men. Menjou is perfect also when -while having lunch with Mac Ready- and with a sort of total lack of interest informs the man that there will be an inquire to judge for his behavior but you notice his eyes look clearly to see the other man's reaction and enjoy it. But mostly, in such a complex and unlikeable character (he goes along with the three soldiers shooting knowing perfectly it won't serve justice) his General Broulard transmits a sort of dignity and sympathy to the viewers.And incredibly natural performer, Menjou died 5 years after this film at age 73. A great actor indeed.",9,1,1,2 November 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Outstanding Thriller, Great Performances
","'The Silence of the Lambs' is probably the best thriller in the last 20 years and one of the best ever.Clarice Starling (Jody Foster)is in her last year at the FBI training academy. Confident in his conditions Senior agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) assigns her to the case of a young girl's serial killer. What Crawford expects is Starling to contact brilliant psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), imprisoned for life and to have him help in the case as a profound expert in psychopatic behaviors and profiles (he is in jail for being a perfect example of both). From then on and simultaneously with the investigation, the film deals with the bizarre relationship between the intelligent and ambitious Starling and the convicted brutal assassin. Somehow both of them get to respect each other's bright personalities and feel a sick mutual attraction.A very original story, an excellent script, a flawless atmosphere, an adequate musical score and a perfect casting are skillfully handled by director Jonathan Demme to obtain an extraordinary film in its genre. The final sequences keep the rest of the movie's high level unlike so many thrillers that have interesting plots but loose impact in the end.Oscars for Hopkins and Foster where awarded for their performances in this picture and they sure deserve them.Don't waste time with the sequels; once you have been in Paris postcards will not satisfy you.",9,0,0,3 October 2006
Ben-Hur," ' The Race Continues Judah ! '
","'Ben Hur' is one of the classic epic spectaculars so common back in the 50's and early 60's and ranks among the best along with 'Quo Vadis', 'The Ten Commandments', 'Spartacus', 'El Cid' and some other. But which one is 'the' best? They're all very good films so number 1 will depend on each one's personal preference; perhaps 'Spartacus' is the top one for me, but a different choice couldn't be questioned.No doubt William Wyler was a very competent director and he succeeds in delivering a most enjoying, interesting, touching and powerful picture that deals with love, friendship, loyalty, treason, revenge and religious faith.Perhaps the most remembered moment of film is the impressive chariot's race in a time where computers were not around and stunts risked their physical integrity to make things believable for us. Great music too that goes along with the sense of greatness the picture transmits. In my opinion the last part when Judah searches for his mother and sister is perhaps a bit slow, but it doesn't hurt the film.Charlton Heston renders an intense performance as Judah Ben Hur with outstanding moments in the role around which the whole film is built. Jack Hawkins shows the necessary dignity as Quintus Arrius the Roman consul that adopts Heston and gives him his name and status. Hugh Griffith won a most deserved Oscar as Arab sheik Ilderim the man who convinces Judah to face Messala in the race ('... there's no law in the arena'). Stehphen Boyd renders what is perhaps his best performance ever as Messala the childhood friend of Judah that becomes his sworn enemy just for ambition and fights him fiercely (his final sequence after the race is outstanding if not brilliant). The accurate supporting cast includes Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell (as Heston's mother and sister), Sam Jaffe (good old Gunga Din), Finlay Currie and Australian actor Frank Thring a regular villain in costume epics back then ('The Vikings', 'El Cid', 'King of Kings') here in a more sympathetic role as Poncious Pilate.An excellent piece of cinema or even more considering it was made more than 45 years ago. Once again: they don't make films like this one anymore.",8,1,3,31 October 2006
Rear Window," How Did Hitchcock Do It ?
","I've been always amazed by Alfred Hithcock's incredible ability to create real good thrillers without hiding the villain or murderer's identity through the picture; he usually reveals it right from the start. In 'North by Nortwest' we know all along that James Mason is the villain, and the same happens with Joseph Cotten in 'Shadow of a Doubt', John Dall in 'The Rope', Ray Milland in 'Dial M for Murder', Robert Walker in 'Strangers on a Treain' and even Charles Laughton in the old 'Jamaica Inn'. The point is that the director creates tension, intrigue and high impact with perfectly handled situations which is not an easy task and requires a lot of talent.'Rear Window' is another example. Bounded to a wheel-chair photograph L.B. Jeffries passes his time by spying his neighbors apartments through his window helped by the big eye of his camera. He gets interested in one of them (Raymond Burr) who is clearly planning something and not before long we realize the man's intention is murdering his wife which he does. From then on the picture enters in its most tense and interesting parts as Jeffries, helped by his girlfriend Lisa (Grece Kelly) and his housekeeper Stella (Thelma Ritter), searches for evidence to catch the killer.'Rear Window' stands as a perfect thriller where you almost feel in Stewarts skin (all you see outside his apartment is what he sees through his camera). And when the murderer -aware that he's been spotted- comes over you are worried too.All in all, a real impressive film by Hitchock with lots of tension, thrills and perfect performances. Forget remakes and go for this one; you won't regret it.",9,0,1,1 November 2006
300," Depends on Your Focus
","If you take '300' as an historical film about the heroic battle of the Greek (Spartans really) against the Persians at the Thermopylae pass back in 480 BC many items won't fit and it won't work. If you consider the movie as a fantasy in ancient Greece based on real events and people it turns out as a an enjoyable and entertaining product no doubt.The main features here are a splendid photography, light -and somehow intense- colour, action sequences carefully shot, some bizarre characters -such as Ephialtes or Xerxes himself- and a couple of mythological animals, all that clearly shows this is a comic book put into an epic film.On this second focus '300' is surely worth a watch if only to see what 'computarized' special effects can do for action movies in our days.",6,0,0,5 June 2008
The Great Escape," Very Good Entertaining but Not the Best Ever
","This a very good film about the massive escape from a German concentration camp by prisoner allied officers during World War II. No doubt about it. John Surges was indeed and intelligent director whose best products where in the western genre ('Gunfight at the OK Corral', 'The Magnificent Seven')in my opinion. No doubt also that 'The Great Escape' reaches the rank of an epic spectacular film and is enjoyable and entertaining. Efficient actors also and a great musical score.However, and as for me, it is perhaps the fact that the story is based on real happenings that sort of limited the script and Sturges usual daring in doing movies; it seems as if the director sort of self control himself in order to go along with the real facts and show the in the most accurate way. In such terms, the film turns out as sort of standard and lacks real impact in all.Don't get me wrong; this is a very good movie no doubt, interesting, entertaining and tense. But I think the focus on the true story and how things really happened gives it a sort of colourful documentary sense that demerits a bit what you expect from a war film of its undenieble level.",6,2,5,11 February 2007
Braveheart," A Very Good Film in its Genre
","I have to admit that I don't know much about William Wallace the Scottish hero that fought against England's ruling in his country back in the 13th century. So I have to take this film as an epic one based on true facts I don't know much about.On that line, I think Mel Gibson obtains a very good product in the epic spectacular genre that reminds us over 50 of those classics of the 50's and early 60's such as 'Spartacus', 'Ben Hur' or 'El Cid', among others.Gibson gives his character a great sense of heroism and his film an undeniable sense of greatness. The script is well done and sustains interest all along the extended duration of the film. The action sequences and massive battles are perfectly achieved too. The musical score fits accordingly.If not perfect technically speaking Gibson's performance as Wallace is strong and convincing. Patrick McGoohan is perfect as the mean King Eduard I and Sophie Marceau does well also as the future queen of England that gets mixed up with Gibson. No complaints on the rest of the cast either.'Braveheart' is a fine piece of cinema, all spectacle and color, perhaps one of the best made in its genre.",8,1,2,21 February 2007
The Godfather," An Offer You Can't Refuse at All l!!
","The Godfather stands as the ultimate film in the Mafia and gangsters genre. I don't think it could have been improved in any way. A very interesting story, tremendous action scenes, great special effects, outstanding performances, strong direction, not a single sequence in excess, a good soundtrack, perfect timing, details carefully attended to, well defined characters, etc, etc.Marlon Brando's acting is perfect. In a cast with such top actors as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, James Caan and John Cazale -among many others- he clearly stands out. In fact, I had the feeling that their performances got even better -if possible- after Brando passes away and is out of the picture. Few Oscars for Best Actor have been awarded with more justice than the one Brando got in this one. Old timers -even for 1972- Sterling Hayden and Richard Conte both in short roles, are also a major nostalgic ingredient that raises the movie for those of us who saw them often on the screen through the 50's.No much more to say on this extraordinary film except perhaps that the two sequels that followed, great movies too, are one clear step below The Godfather.",10,1,4,5 September 2006
