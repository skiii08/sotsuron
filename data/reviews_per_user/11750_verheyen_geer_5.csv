Minority Report," one of Spielberg's best movies, technical great!
","This is one of the best movies that Spielberg has ever made. A great movie, but the cause is not Tom Cruise, who is acting good but not better than in some of his other movies, but the real heroes who make this film a classic are the cameras. We see great movements from the camera in a great technical film with also an original story. Tom Cruise is an agent in the near future who works by Precrime, a project that can see murders before they are really happened. Everything goes well for 6 years, but then the cop (Cruise) is accused himself of murder. What happens next??? See the movie to know it!! My marks => 9/10",8,0,0,16 June 2005
The Graduate," one of the best comedies ever made
","I love The Gradute, with a very young and ennoying nervous Dustin Hofmann! But why do I love it so much? I haven't seen great technical effects, I haven't heard great sound effects. I do have seen very sudden aggressive camera-movements. Still, the film gets 8/10 from me. That's because I love the story (great adaptation from Charles Webb's novel)and I love the soundtrack sang by the great Simon & Garfunkel (Sounds Of Silence, Mrs. Robinson,...). The plot? A graduated student starts an affair with one of the friends of the family (the woman has the double age). They are having an affair for months and then he falls in love with the daughter. The affair with the mother comes out and the situation escalates... If you haven't't seen The Graduate yet, enjoy it and don't wait with it too long, because it's a great movie!!",7,0,1,18 June 2005
Downfall," great sober film, best Hitlerfilm ever made!
","'Der Untergang' (Downfall) has got a lot of comment when he released because Adolf Hitler would be 'too much human.' I don't support the man's ideas but I'm convinced that also he could love; he loved his dog a lot and he loved his wife just like any other human.In this movie we see a Adolf Hitler with two faces: the Hitler as militair and the Hitler as human. Hitler can be very loving but also very angry and hard. In this movie is Adolf Hitler played by Bruno Ganz and he's the best Hitler in the movieworld! (That's of course only my opinion but believe me, I have already seen many movieHitlers) Bruno Ganz is so good in playing this two faced Hitler: first you see him with a smile on face, giving his wife a hug and the next moment you see him really angry yelling to his generals. Great!Because the movie plays the most of the time in a bunker, it's a very sober movie. Sober movies are not necessarily bad movies (look to 'Million Dollar Baby' or 'Batman Begins') and concerning the subject of this movie it must be a sober movie!I can not believe that this film hasn't won an Oscar last year. He really was the best nominee for the category Foreign Language Film and my opinion is that Bruno Ganz deserved at least a nomination for Best Actor In A Leading Role, but the (conservative) Academy has decided....However, 'Der Untergang' is a great movie who everybody must have seen. It's a movie about war, but also love, sentimentality and to lose your sense of reality...",9,2,4,23 June 2005
Trainspotting," A movie like there aren't two of it, a must-see!!!!!
","'Trainspotting' is based on a novel but the only thing where the two stories are the same is the storyline. The film is great with great characters, great dialogues and great activities.I love the film because in the history of the film, there aren't made two movies like this one. It's a strange movie. Not like when you watch to a film with Jean-Claude Van Damme when you know what you can expect.The film has also a hip soundtrack with great, 'modern' songs! (Iggy Pop, Underworld and even Ice MC) 'Trainspotting' is full of surprises! You can not judge a movie before you've seen it and so everybody must see this movie and when you've seen it shall everybody say: 'This is a great movie!'",9,2,4,23 June 2005
Braveheart," good, but no classic!
","Today I've seen Braveheart, a movie that has won 5 Oscars in 1996, for the first time. My judgment? It's a good movie, but I've seen much better movies! This movie is full of typical moments: a man who's wife is killed and wants revenge. He becomes a great leader with many warriors and keeps great speeches... The only real scene that belongs in a classic is the scene where William becomes tortured! I also think that the movie would be better if he was an hour shorter. On certain moments the film is really boring! The soundtrack is phenomenal. I love the music that James Horner had made for this movie!! Conclusion: a good historical epos, much better than Troy (Troy sucks) but not so good as Gladiator or war movies as The thin red line or Saving Private Ryan!",6,0,1,17 June 2005
