Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Spoiler Warning - Stay Away From This Movie
","I have never walked out of a movie in my life, until I saw Sasha Cohen's 'Borat', a tribute to the primeval slime that humanity came from eons ago. As a human being who is proud of how far our species has come, despite all the uncivilized behavior that goes on in the world, I think there needs to be a minimum level of decency maintained between people. Otherwise, we might as well go back to living in caves and clubbing each other on the head.I am going to definitely spoil the movie for you in this review but the truth is I would only be doing you a favor. There is very little of redeeming quality in this movie. Right from the start, I do have a problem with having Kazak's shown as primitive imbeciles that engage in incest and bestiality. I have nothing against Kazakhstan and its people and I don't find it funny that they're portrayed in such negative ways when they've done nothing wrong to me. But I looked past that because people whose opinions I value told me it was a funny movie.To be fair, the movie has a few moments I could appreciate. For one thing it exposed how unfriendly American culture has become. There's a scene early on in the movie when Cohen, recently arrived in the US for the first time in his life, tries to greet random Americans on the street in what is portrayed as the Kazak way. Although it would have been strange to see Cohen coming towards you to shake your hand and kiss you on the cheek, there was clearly something wrong in the way many of the American people reacted. The men usually reacted with anger and threats of violence. It was actually nice that the movie chose to contrast that reaction with those of men at a gay parade. At the parade, no one found it threatening or offensive that Cohen got too personal with them. I can tell you that if a strange looking man like Cohen were to go up to random people in a third world country, they would look at him as if he was insane, but they would at least either greet him or move away and laugh. Not in America apparently.There's another interesting scene where Cohen is at a rodeo in Georgia, right in the middle of redneck America, where pure ignorance and racism are passed through breast milk. One of the kind gentlemen at the rodeo tells Cohen that he should shave his mustache so that he wouldn't look like the bad guys, you know Muslims. The ones you're not sure whether they have a bomb strapped to their bodies. Because you know how many of them have strapped explosives to themselves and blown up rodeos. I hope that man watches this movie so that he can see how ridiculous, bigoted, evil and stupid he looks talking the way he does about people he's never seen in real life. As for the rest of the scene, let's just say it was a very disappointing look at the blood lust in the hearts of those who claim to be the most devout of Christ's followers.However, that's where all the few interesting moments end. The rest of the movie is focused on insulting people on screen for cheap laughs. I was ready to walk out in a scene where Cohen goes to a bed and breakfast where he discovers that the owners are Jews. However, he didn't end up insulting them, but rather act out a reasonably funny scene that exposed the stupidity of people who would hate others to the point of believing such stupid lies about them Â… such as being able to shape shift.The worst scene in movie history is set at a dinner table where a number of older couples were trying to help Cohen learn etiquette by playing host to him. I will not dwell on the scene too much but I will say this; it involves a piece of feces and a hooker. It was at this point that I left the theater and it's at this point that I truly saw the evil that Cohen has unleashed on a world only too happy to accept it. And one more thing, what the hell is wrong with those people at the dinner. They're so eager to be hospitable and politically correct that they were willing to put up with all the gross acts of a disgusting man when any sane person would have beaten him senseless and thrown him on his ass by the side of the road.What more can I say, this was the worst movie I have ever seen.",1,18,38,6 November 2006
