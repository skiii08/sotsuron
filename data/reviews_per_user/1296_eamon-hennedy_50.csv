Scarface," Pacino, guns and chainsaws. Fantastic.
","One of the most definitive gangster films of the 80's, Scarface is very much a film of its time. The first thing you notice when  you watch this film is that it is screaming at you, 'made in 1983'. The costumes, the music score and soundtrack, the hairstyles, make no mistake about it this is a film all about crime in the 80's and while it should have dated horribly it hasn't. This is still a superb film. While Georgio Moroder's music has dated a fair bit, it still compliments the story of Tony Montana well thanks to the superb screenplay by Oliver Stone and the first class direction of Brian De Palma, one of two films that he has made with Pacino (the other being the fantastic Carlito's Way). All of De Palma's trademarks are here; the strong language, the graphic violence (more on that later), the stylish excesses such as grandiose set pieces and of course the stylish camera work.
Pacino dominates the film and I mean that literally. He is the dominant star of this film. His performance over the top, this is one of those films were Pacino doesn't so much say his lines as he does shouts them, this time with a superb Cuban accent. However, this is Pacino and he does it fantastically. Only he could go this far over the top and still come away from the film with his acting integrity in tact. While some may complain about his shouting of his lines and the sheer excess of it all, this is an excessive film. Take a look at the production design of Tony's house, take a look at the violence in this film. The chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere. The shoot out at the end has bodies going down at a rate that is more akin to Schwarzenegger and Stallone in the Rambo films. Take a look at the amount of coke that is displayed in the film so Pacino's performance I suppose is perfect for the film. He is supported by actors who are more akin to saying their lines in a more controlled way. Steven Bauer, in particularly, as Manny, Tony's  best friend, is the stand out of the supporting cast. His performance is so controlled and quiet in a De Niro sort of way it is a wonder how he ended up doing straight to video soft porn. Michelle Pfeiffer, of course, adds the glamor, Robert Loggia adds gravitas as usual and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio makes a great debut as Tony's sister.Of course this is more than just a film about excess. There is more to it than drugs, violence, chainsaw assaults and a big great shoot out. This is a film about the darker side of the American dream. In many ways it puts it on a thematic par with The Godfather films. Tony finds himself coming to America, getting it all, living the American dream and then losing it all in violent fashion, and by saying he loses it all, I mean he loses it all. He kills his best friend, his sister is killed, his empire crumbles, literally, around him and to top it of he is killed in his own mansion, bullets ripping through him. Without doubt Scarface is one of the key films of the early 80's. Sure, it doesn't  have the subtleties of The Godfather films, but this is still a fine film and one that is worth going to again and again.",8,0,1,3 November 2003
The Incredible Hulk," Really Incredible.
","You see, here's my problem, Ang Lee's Hulk was, to all intents and purposes, a noble film, very noble in fact. The man responsible for bringing one of the definitive Jane Austen adaptations to our screens as well as one of modern cinema's great martial arts epics, not to mention The Ice Storm, took it upon himself to art up, for lack of a better term, I do apologise, I'm sure I could have come up with something better, a property that consists of a man turning into a green monster who says 'Hulk smash' pretty much most of the time. It was noble, of course it was, layering in a foundation that took in split screen editing, that worked, and a complicated relationship with his father and a brooding atmosphere, it was just the film was turning the character and story into something it wasn't, which is why I think bringing in Louis Louterrier and essentially broadening the whole style of the film is a good move, and let's not beat around the bush, The Incredible Hulk, as opposed to Ang Lee's Hulk is a broader movie in every way. The film is not as inherently complex as the previous, the action is more frequent and a hell of lot more fun and more clear to see most of the time and the relationship between Betty and Bruce is a lot more romantic, with a lovely comedic element becoming a lot more engaging. In fact the whole film is engaging in every way that Lee's isn't. Edward Norton, an actor for fairly intense performances, brings that element, but also fun, to his performance and his uncredited work on the screenplay. He plays the more light hearted moments (stretchy pants, anyone, or inability to make love with Betty) beautifully, making his Banner quite a lovely character and you can't help but feel sympathetic to his plight. Liv Tyler is lovely throughout, but that's really all she brings to the table, but let's not get carried away, she does it well, whilst the villains, William Hurt and Tim Roth are fantastic, particularly Roth who literally becomes a worse character than the one he is chasing.There are those who will undoubtedly bemoan that the film is dumbed down compared to Ang Lee's version, but to be honest with you, I think the film works best because of it. It may be wrong to refer to it as being dumbed down, I think calling it a broader film works better. The action is more elaborate and high octane, the CGI is miles better than before, with the Hulk himself looking less like Shrek's angrier twin brother and more like a flesh and blood creation. It's hair blowing in the wind and the vain's pumping through its green skin is a wonderful piece of visual effects work and the believability of it makes the film easier to enjoy, a major flaw of the previous version. If there is a criticism to level at it it has to be with the climax. The fight sequence between the Hulk and the Abomination starts of well, but does go on a bit long and at times, with all the CGI going starts to resemble a video game. It's the only fault with the movie, but not a glaring one, and when it's the only fault I am finding as compared to the many that film number one had, it's not bad going, and of course, as with all comic book adaptations nowadays, the ending only leaves you gagging for more. That is a great final shot.Hulk, you are incredible again.",8,1,1,19 July 2009
Mission: Impossible III," A great addition to the series.
","As a fan of the first two movies of Tom Cruise's Mission:Impossible franchise, I awaited the arrival of number three with some excitement, not only for the fact that it was continuing a movie series that has already set itself as a series with differening styles for each movie making it an enjoyable addition to the spy-fi genre, but for the fact that this installment was being written and directed by the man who had turned that said genre on its head in the last five years with his television series Alias, one Mr JJ Abrams. He is a great choice to handle this movie and it ensures that Mission:Impossible 3 is a terrific movie.Like the television series Alias, M:I 3 features a story that revolves around its leading character living a life as a spy, while trying to juggle a personal life in which he must hide his true job from those he loves, in this case his fianc√©e (played by the quite lovely Michelle Monaghan). Of course, like Alias, as the film continues, said personal life and professional life becoming involved head on and the resulting plot includes kidnappings, weapons of mass destruction (which, like Alias, may have a quasi-spiritual/religious element to it) and the leading character having to go rogue for a spell. It all adds up for two hours of great fun, overheated action sequences and a fun time in the cinema, which is what this franchise has managed to do now three times. Tom Cruise seems to be welcoming playing the character of Ethan Hunt with a few more dimensions with the welcome inclusion of a life outside of IMF even though the relationship is played out in a conventional, slushy Hollywood way what with the misty eyed looks and PG-13/12 rated make out sessions. As well as a good performance from Cruise, Abrams, who is obviously a fan of the series, has decided, like in the series from the 1960's, to center his leading man around a superb ensemble. Ving Rhames makes a welcome return as Luther Stickell, while we have the additions of Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the rest of his team and it should be said that this element works very well, so well that it wouldn't be a bad idea to try and ensure these characters come back for any proposed fourth installment, while any film in the world that features Laurence Fishburne is worth watching in my estimation.Of course what one expects from a film like this are action sequences, and with James Bond veteran Vic Armstrong on duty here, the audience will not be disappointed. The rescue mission of a fellow agent in the opening half four get things of to a nice start, but it is the attack sequence on the bridge that will cement this film a reputation. Brutal, chaotic and quite violent (there is a number of collateral damage in the sequence), it shows that JJ Abrams is, like Joss Whedon, born to be making movies, making his television work almost seem like a try out period.Overall this is a superb film. No doubt like the first two movies, there will a wealth of mixed opinion, but I for one loved it, so much it made me want to watch the first two again (oh, that sounds like a nice idea for a double feature), while simultaneously making one excited for a fourth installment (please, don't make it be another six years). In the meantime, Mission:Impossible 3 ensures that we'll be humming that theme tune for a while to come yet.",9,0,3,9 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Far from being a disaster.
","Let me get it out of the way, I really like The Phantom Menace. While there was a lot of indifference when the film was released, I really enjoyed it. The first prequel to the fantastic original trilogy may not be the strongest film of the Star Wars series, or even one of the best blockbusters to come out of Hollywood, it is nevertheless an entertaining ride with a lot to recommend it. First of Liam Neeson is perfect as Qui-Gon-Jinn (I hope that spelling is right). The nearest that we Northern Irish have to a movie star of our own without doubt the best actor in it. His commanding presence and wonderful delivery of his lines recalls Alec Guinness. That's not to say that Ewan McGregor isn't good as the young Obi Wan as he is superb also. While his accent attempt may be a little too English for some, he is better than would have been expected. In saying that Natalie Portman brings the film down a bit. Her performance is, dare I say, a little wooden at time, which is a surprise considering her fantastic performances in Leon and Beautiful Girls. She is undeniably beautiful as Queen Amidala (she is the mother of Princess Leia, she has to be beautiful), but her performance needed a lot more work. Likewise Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. Some child actors can be great, but Lloyd just sleep walks through the film and considering the importance of the character he is playing, it does damage the film a little.Acting, however, is not what this film is about. It's about lightsabre duels and CGI and there is plenty of both. Lucas does go a little overboard with the CGI but the effects are stunning (especially the Spartacus style battle at the end) and the lightsabre battle between Obi Wan, Qui Gon and Darth Maul is spectacular. While his skills as a writer of dialog may have slid over the twenty odd years between his last directing gig, there is no denying that Lucas can still put on a spectacle.This film is not the second coming, nor is it the disaster that critics and nay sayers painted it out as. I have never been on of those Star Wars obsessives, although I admit I have always enjoyed the films, but The Phantom Menace is a film I found hugely entertaining. The pod race, the knowledge that we know what will happen to Anakin, it all makes for an entertaining film. Sure it's not art, it's entertainment and is a pure example of what cinema is meant to do. The dialog in the original Star Wars film wasn't the strongest either and essentially this is the sun lit world that Lucas is presenting to us before the darkness settles in with the next two installments.As a moderate fan of Star Wars, I believe that The Phantom Menace is a fun film and one that is hugely enjoyable.",Null,1,2,8 December 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," BEST FILM ABOUT PIRATES...EVER!!!
","That's right. This is the best film about pirates and the high seas. Everything here works, this is the most perfect summer slice of blockbuster escapism that has emerged in a long time. High brow critics may bulk, but this is not meant to be a film that is all about characterization and emotion, it's meant to be fun, fun and fun and we get a lot of it.
First of all, Johnny Depp is great. The surprising thing about it is, he seems well suited to being in a blockbuster film, more so that I thought before, and even more surprising is that his role as Jack Sparrow isn't the type that is taking advantage of his movie star good looks. Here is has dirty teeth, rag tag long hair and is playing basically a crook, but a lovable one of course. His performance is perfect, from his mannerisms, the slurred speech and the Keith Richards like accent, he should definitely be a favorite for the Golden Globe for best actor in a musical or comedy. The rest of the cast are well filled out too, with Orlando Bloom magnificent as the straight man Will Turner, Kiera Knightly is very lovely as the damsel in distress and finally Geoffrey Rush is great as the evil villain with a nice sideline in comedy.The script is surprisingly witty here, but coming from the writers of Shrek, this isn't surprising. It's not high art, but the script is a wonderful adventure laced with magnificent humor. Gore Verbinski as director handled the material rather well, which is a surprise. As the director of The Ring and Mousehunt, I wasn't sure if he were the right choice to be doing this film, especially considering that it is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, but alas, I wouldn't be surprised after this effort if Verbinski joins Michael Bay and Tony Scott in the esteemed list of Bruckheimer directors.Of course the special effects are brilliant also. The sequences involving the dastardly crew of the Black Pearl turning into skeletons (the CGI monkey is terrifically well realized) are amongst some of the best special effects of 2003, while the shot of all the pirates of the Black Pearl walking on the ocean floor is spine tingling.Overall this is a fantastic film and ranks as one of the best blockbusters to have emerged from this decade so far.",10,1,3,6 January 2004
Batman Returns," A Great Sequel...
","First thing first. Batman Returns is not as good as Batman, but it is still a fantastic film. The film is more in line with Tim Burton's sensibilities as a film director mainly because unlike the first film which had a lot of studio interference, Burton had a free hand here. Whereas the first Batman film had more of a film noir/urban thriller/horror approach, Batman Returns is more like a dark fairy tale, with Bruce Wayne's mansion more of a castle in this film, snow falling on to the streets of Gotham City and a villain who is definitely a monster. Along with way we have a romantic angle that is played in a more quirky manner than usual, with a humour that is more ironic and touching than the dark and black style in the first film.Of all the sequels to the perfect original, Batman Returns is the best as despite the more fairy tale leanings, it is still a stone throw away from the campness of the horrible Joel Schumacher films and unlike the next two movies, this film is perfectly cast. Keaton once again shows why he was perfect as Bruce Wayne, with a little more humour here than what he showed in the first film, with his chemistry with Michelle Pfeiffer perfect with a touch of bitter sweet about it, especially in the final five minutes in their final confrontation and also with Michael Gough, who plays Alfred. The reference to Vicki Vale being let into the bat cave is an especially nice touch. Speaking of Pfeiffer, she is perfect as Catwoman/Selina Kyle, playing the innocent moments at the start brilliantly, but the psychotic urges in the later parts of the film even better while Danny De Vito was simply born to play the Penguin, being sympathetic yet horrible and disgusting too.While the first film is undoubtedly the best, Batman Returns is more of Tim Burton's statement on the Dark Knight and this universe. His trademarks are in place, while the Penguin is portrayed more as a freak outsider of society than just a villain while the quirky nature of the relationship between Bruce and Selina is also played out in a brilliant sense of twisted humour that only Burton can handle. Plus Danny Elfman's music is perfect with quite possibly the best theme tune in movie history playing throughout.The film is a fairy tale, albeit one without an unhappy ending. Penguin dies horribly, his life in tatters, while Bruce is left to go back to his castle alone, and not live happily ever after with the woman he loves, despite the fact that they are equals. It is a wonderful film and is one worthy of repeat viewing.",8,0,0,10 June 2003
X-Men," Fantastic Adaptation!
","Adapted from the most popular comic book on the planet and starring two Shakespearian actors, a virtually unknown Australian and directed by a man better known for a dark, edgy crime thriller, this really shouldn't be good, but it is. In fact it is fantastic. From beginning to end Bryan Singer makes what has to be one of the best comic book adaptations to hit the screen in years, perhaps the finest since Tim Burton brought Batman to the screen in 1989. What works so well here are the factors that should bring the film crashing down. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is fantastic, showing what a great star he could make. His perfect American accent and the wonderful dark edge, mixed in with humor and sincerity for Rogue make him the most perfect choice for the character.In fact casting here is perfect, which is a miracle for a comic book that is not made up of one primary superhero like Superman, Batman and Spiderman are. X-Men is an ensemble and Singer casts actors perfectly in their parts. Patrick Stewart is undeniably the only actor who could play Professor X, likewise Ian McKellen as Magneto. Anna Paquin shows what a talent she can be in her more older years as Marie/Rogue, while Famke Janssen adds the glamorous as Doctor Jean Grey. The remaining X Men characters of Scott/Cyclops and Monroe/Storm are played well enough by James Marsden and Halle Berry, but don't really get a chance to shine in the same way as the others do, mainly due to the fact that the script has to accommodate so many characters, but that's why this film works so well. Singer and writer David Hayter have saw fit not to bombard the film with action sequences and flashy special effects, they let the characters come to life, have the audience care for them and when they have done that, then they bring out the action in the shape of the Statue of Liberty finale.As the first part of a movie series, X-Men works a wonderful treat. The script is strong, the acting is first class and Bryan Singer's direction of the actors is fantastic as are his visual touches, which are very similar to comic book framing. Actors are film to one side of the frame while the remainder is taken up with the background. Touches like this show what a great director he is visually. Even better the action is brilliantly handled. The Liberty finale features a storming fight sequence between Logan and shape-shifter Mistique, who has taken the form of Logan himself. It is a fun sequence that is also gripping.Scarcely a foot is put wrong in this superb film which ranks as one of my favorite comic book adaptations.",10,0,0,17 November 2003
The Terminator," What the 1980's were all about.
","This is a genuinely great film in every regards. James Cameron has crafted a film that works on so many emotional and story telling levels, it was an early sign of what a great talent he was going to be in future years (even if the budgets were to get out of control). To start of The Termintator works as a great science fiction/time travel story, but transends that and goes of into other fantastic realms as Cameron takes the film and turns it into a great gothic love story, a nightmarish thriller and a story of irony and love. It is a classic film and one that defines the 80's. Where he suceeds most is with his story. Cameron's abilities as a story teller is what makes him one of the best directors working today and the story of Sarah Connor and the battle to either save or end her life is compulsive film and is dealt with with great assurance from Cameron as he takes full control of the screenplay and the direction, squeezing every emotion and inch of suspense for all it is worth.It is no surprise to see that Arnie went on to bigger and better things after this film. His performance in this film is that of sheer menace. The lack of emotion and that cold, icy face makes the character an icon, even if he is such an evil person (thing). While saying half a dozen lines, looking evil and firing lots of guns isn't what you would call a great performance, Arnie turns it into an art form and showed everybody in 1984 that this guy could just be the next best thing.If Arnie (sorry for calling him that, I can't spell his surname) is the evil centre of the story, then Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn are the emotional centre, the love story that develops between them heartbreaking at the end, but one which throughout the film gives us a sense of optimism. Their performances are fantastic, especially Hamilton, and the development of their characters is spot on.It is no surprise that Cameron went on to bigger and better things after this, but the film is still a monumental one and one that is often associated with him, even if it is a low budget thriller. While the sequel would go on to be better (in my opinion), it is the sheer horror and viciousness of this film as well as the performance of Arnie that will always make us remember this one even more.",9,0,1,23 May 2003
Alien," A welcome slice of dark sci-fi.
","For me, Ridley Scott's Alien is one of the most perfect pieces of cinema, not only with regards to its genre, or genre hybridization, in this case sci-fi and horror, but also one of the finest films ever made. Unlike the fairy tale world of Star Wars (which I like I have to say), or the philosophical and mythological world of The Matrix (which I love, it is my favourite movie series I have to say), Alien is something of a rarity, a science fiction movie set in a world that is almost realistic and authentic. Of course the movie hinges of an extra terrestrial, a space ship, a strange planet and all manners of grisly deaths, but what makes the film so good is how the film feels real because director Ridley Scott and screenwriters Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shussett have set their thrill packed horror spectacular in a future world that feel real. Their main characters are not soldiers or quasi-religious figures, they are merely futuristic equivalents of truck drivers, carrying their cargo not from city to city but from planet to planet. It is this kind of creation of character and mise en scene within the film that gives it its charm, in a manner of speaking.The way in which the story develops is also superb. What starts out as a film about a potential rescue mission for the main characters then turns into one about a medical emergency surrounding one of their own, in this case Kane played by John Hurt. The film then takes its twist and development into the film everyone knows and loves via its most famous scene at approximately the half way mark (that's almost sixty minutes in to a two hour movie), another superb piece of development as it allows the audience to get to like these characters before the violence and chaos begins. Of course when the chaos and violence do begins the film becomes one of the most thrilling ever produced, with its increasingly claustrophobic settings and the systematic killing of each one of its crew until only Weaver is the only woman left standing.What I love most about the film is that coming at the end of the seventies (in this case 1979), the film is almost symbolic of everything that the American film industry had gone through throughout that decade artistically. The film has the science fiction leanings and fascination with technology and space travel that Hollywood was going through at that time with Star Wars, Close Encounters and even James Bond with Moonraker, but it also has that dark rawness that Hollywood had scene throughout the first six to seven years of that decade and witnessed in films like The French Connection, The Godfather and that other classic staple of the horror genre, The Exorcist. Like the latter movie, this is a film that, as I have said before, exhibits its plight of the fantastic and the horror inside a world that, while not as realistic as the one presented in Friedkin's film, is not that is possibly plausible.Mention must go to Ridley Scott for his superb direction (his first mainstream Hollywood film) as well as all the actors (special mention must go, as always, to Weaver who truly deserved to become a big star after this movie) who in doing the movie gave us one of the most startling and most interesting movie series in mainstream Hollywood.",10,1,3,2 May 2006
Lost in Translation," Fantastic, I loved it to pieces!
","A wonderful film from beginning to end, this is one of the finest I have seen this year so far. Bill Murray has always been one of my favorite actors and I have been waiting anxiously to see him do a truly great 'serious' role that is worthy of  his talents and this is it. The character of Bob Harris is his signature role as a talented performer and as a result becomes simultaneously his best performance and film since the equally wonderful Groundhog Day in 1993. The jet-lag, isolation and loneliness of Harris is brought wonderfully to life and sees Murray wonderfully convey the poignancy and humor of his character. While there are serious moments to his performance, he still brings that wonderful wry comedic style he is so great at. Just take a look at his encounter with a prostitute ('lip my stocking') or his bewilderment at how long a translation is to something that he said that was very short.At the heart of Lost in Translation is a love story and Murray would be nothing without a great female actress to play against and we have one here in the shape of the lovely Scarlett Johanssen. As Charlotte she is the female equivalent to Bob. An apparently loveless marriage, although one with enough care to last, and alienated in the culture of Japan, the way she plays of Murray as these two lonely souls find comfort in one another's company is nothing short of superb. She truly deserved that BAFTA and she deserves to win the Oscar too.Writer/director Sofia Coppola masterfully tells her story and avoids sentiment and over reaching emotion instead relying on heartfelt intensity to demonstrate the relationship between these two characters. Her screenplay is one hundred per cent perfect. Her dialog wonderfully sharp and her treatment of the romance at the core of the film touching without the obvious touches. Her direction is also flawless. Her wonderful way of presenting images, such as the sun splitting through the leaves on a tree, or the skyline of Tokyo are joys to behold and shows the world that she is truly her father's daughter. While there has been some finger pointing that she has only gotten where she has today due to her father, with a film like this I would say she deserves her status and a film like this marks her out as one of the finest young directors working today. Just take a look at how she avoids sex throughout the whole movie. Sure there's a trip to a strip club, but Bob and Charlotte never have sex. The closest we get to it is when the two share a bed together, but only to fall asleep for the first time since they arrived. The only moment were sex is presented symbolic is when after a night of karaoke singing, where the two gaze at each other romantically, they meet up, alone to have a cigarette. This is simply wonderful cinema.I understand that there are many out there that did not like this film, and there are reasons for that. The film is more slower paced that you would expect and the film is more underplayed than overplayed, but if you can get past this, you will experience a quite simply life affirming film that I believe is masterpiece. I loved it to pieces.",10,1,2,19 February 2004
The Godfather: Part II," THE GREATEST SEQUEL IN THE HISTORY OF FILM.
","Magnificent from beginning to end, The Godfather Part II is a superb film that betters what was already a perfect film to begin with. Much more epic in scope and retaining a lot of symbolism and Shakespeare like tragedy, Coppola and Puzo have created a work of art once again. Flashing forward a couple of years after the end of the first film, we find that Michael has well and truly amassed himself as the head of the family. Struggling to turn the business into a legitimate empire, the film flashbacks to the early days of  his father's building of the family business, in what is the first stroke of genius of this sequel. The flashback sequences make the film a much more epic affair and in doing so we see the differences not only in father and son, which is the main thrust of the story of the second part of this trilogy, but we see how much America has changed and how much the dynasty of the Corleone family has altered from small street business to potential empire. The real joy in the flashbacks here is how different father and son are. Whereas we see the love between them in the first film and how much Vito loved Michael, here we see the vast differences between them. As Michael tries to legitimize the family business, we see how increasingly alien like and withdrawn he becomes from those around him. His wife Kay, his 'brother' Tom, his blood brother Fredo and how it all ends in tragedy and with Michael ordering the death of the brother who betrays him. Coppola successfully integrates the flashbacks of a young Vito into all of this. Enhanced by the wonderful performance of Robert De Niro (very young here), we see how Vito built his own empire and we see how different he was to his own son, how he loved his wife very much, how he treated friends with respect, how he immersed himself into their lives, not only of those of his friends and family, but of the people he tried to help on the streets. It is this comparison that makes The Godfather Part II such a brilliant film.The screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo is a masterclass in the art of storytelling. If Shakespeare were alive today, this is the type of film he would be writing. Betrayal plays a big part of this film, as does tragedy. Both the betrayal and the tragedy fall at the hands of the hapless Fredo, betraying his brother and then dying at the hands of a hit organized by Michael himself. John Cazale is a stand out amongst many in this film and the moment where he prays in the boat just before he is killed is one of the most haunting moments ever put on to film. It is both sad in many ways. It reinforces how much Fredo had destroyed the relationship with a brother that he loved and further isolates Michael into his shell, prompting a flashback to happier times and a piece of news that only Fredo reacted warmly to. All of this makes up for a fantastic film. It is truly the greatest sequel ever made. The story is well told, the acting is pure class and the flashback structure is done very well.This is as perfect as perfection will come.",10,1,2,28 October 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Frustrating, But Ultimately Brilliant.
","*****CONTAINS SPOILERS*****As a devoted fan of The Matrix trilogy I waited for baited breath for the final installment. I had loved both The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded and I was dying to know how the Wachowski's would wrap up what has been a fantastic and entertaining slice of science fiction cinema. What we get is an action packed extravaganza that is undeniably brilliant, but at the same time very frustrating. Allow me to elaborate.You see The Matrix Revolutions promises answers. Joel Silver and the cast promised that this would wrap up the series once and for all and while many core elements of the story do conclude, such as the war between man and machine, the elaboration of what happened to Bane, the link between Smith and Neo, many of the character arcs are left in the air too much. For example, what happens to Neo. Does he die after destroying the multiple Smiths after their fierce battle? Why are the machines taking his body away? If he is dead what do they plan to do with him, likewise for if he is alive? Then there is Persephone? What happened when she kissed Neo is Reloaded? We never found out as she only appears in one scene and says one line. Also frustrating is how little the main characters have to do with the battle itself. Morpheus, Link, Niobe, Ghost, Sparks, Roland and his crew are battling to get back to Zion and are not immediately caught up with the battle, instead being the ones who temporarily save the day. Likewise Neo and Trinity. Instead they are on their way to Machine City. None of the main characters have much to do with the dominant story arcs, save for Neo of course. Morpheus is literally in the back seat while all Trinity gets to do throughout the bulk of the movie is guide Neo and then die.It may sound like I'm one of the band of people who did not like this movie but I assure you I am not. The battle sequence is superb. The sight of hundreds of thousands of sentinels swarming into Zion and engaging in battle against the APU's is superb cinema and a sequence that demands a viewing on the largest screen. The sequences in the Merovingian's S&M club, Club Hell are fantastic also. The henchman running on the ceiling while Trinity, Morpheus and Seraph shoot them down brings to mind the Government Lobby sequence from the first film. Then there is the final fight. Neo versus Smith. Fantastic. The extreme nature of the special effects as buildings are destroyed and Neo and Smith fight against a thunder clouded sky are awesome sights and show that this is truly a classic trilogy. My only gripe is that the Wachowski's have left maybe too much for the audience to decide, the biggest one being regarding Neo's fate. He has been the center of this journey, the story in effect filtering through Neo so it is heartbreaking that we never know what happens to him. That aside, the directorial touches from Larry and Andy are masterful as always, the performances from all are superb (Trinity's death scene is handled fantastically by Carrie Anne Moss and Keanu Reeves and Fishburne and Weaving are stand outs as usual) while Don Davis' music score is quite simply one of the finest committed to film. The mixture of pounding orchestra and chorus choir is fantastic to hear and is a classic piece of movie music.Overall Larry and Andy have given us a sight to behold, a magic piece of cinema that I am sure many will never forget.",10,1,2,10 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A Fantastic Film.
","No Cameron, Arnie being a tad older and the fact it was twelve years since T2, while I was looking forward to Terminator 3, I was also a bit of wary, but I shouldn't have been. Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines is fantastic, a spectacularly entertaining blockbuster ride that continues the story with respect, great action, a knowing sense of humor and with a seriousness that doesn't drag the film down. Mostow may have seemed like an unusual choice to direct (someone more along the lines of John McTiernan or Ridley Scott would have more accommodating I would have thought), but he does justice to the first two, continuing the saga of John Connor in a way that more than respects the fineness of the first two films.Essentially the film is a mixture of the first two installments, more so the second one, in the execution of the action sequences (huge chase scene, cyborgs beating each other to a pulp), but like the first one, Mostow favors a more pessimistic tone to the film, giving the film a sense of approaching darkness, especially in the final minutes that is both shocking, touching and moving, in much the same way as Cameron did in the first Terminator film. Mostow does not just put Connor in danger again, have him stop judgment day again and have him live happily ever after again. No, he layers the film with twists and turns such as the fact that the machines' strike on humans was merely delayed and that Connor is now dead in the future, that it his future wife, Katherine (played by Claire Danes) who has sent the T-800 back to save John. Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong and he is a good replacement, perfectly playing the part with a brooding intensity. Danes is charming and if there is a fourth film I hope she will be in it. Kristanna Loken is great at the T-X. Playing the part with a cold blooded humor that is fantastic to watch and lastly there's Arnie. Let's just say it's like watching someone ride a bike after having not done so for many years. He clearly hasn't forgotten (talk to the hand is right).All in all Terminator 3 is terrific. A surprising joy from start to finish, one hopes that a forth film will be left alone because as it stands this is a perfect little trilogy.",10,1,2,4 January 2004
The Shining," Superb slice of eighties horror.
","NOTE: This is a review of the 115 minute UK version released on R2 DVD.Quite possibly one of the best horror films ever made, this is quite possibly one of Stanley Kubrick's most accessible films in the latter part of the directorial career, a dark slice of isolationist horror that uses every trick it can muster to scare the living hell out of the audience, from Jack Nicholson running around with an axe, gory death scenes, ghosts, a perverse scene of semi-sexual activity, you name it and unsurprisingly the film is good, brilliant in fact. It is so easy to single handedly praise Nicholson's performance on it's own, but is merely one aspect of what makes this film so great to watch. First of all there is the direction from Kubrick himself. I'll be honest, I have a love hate relationship with Kubrick's films. I love Full Metal Jacket, Spartacus, Dr Strangelove and of course this film here, but others like A Clockwork Orange and Lolita have tended to leave this viewer cold, I tend to like my films on a more visceral level and I suppose that is the main reason I love The Shining as this is possibly one of his most aesthetically more enjoyable films. It has more of a roller-coaster thrill ride aspect to it rather than the cold aesthetics of 2001 and Barry Lyndon.Of course the film does takes its time to get going, but this adds to the fun as you can feel the tension growing as the film goes on, you can almost feel the possibly supernatural psychosis growing in Jack Torrence with each passing of every minute, Nicholson becoming more and more frightening as the film goes on. The same goes for the performances from Shelly Duvall and Danny Lloyd. You can almost feel the tension building in everyone before the terrifying last half hour begins and it's a testament to Kubrick's handling of the material that you almost feel their emotions as the film goes on. When Duvall as Wendy starts shouting with terror as Jack goes all Johnny Carson on the audience with an axe, you almost feel like shouting with her, likewise when Danny is running through the maze with an axe wielding Jack after him you almost feel like running with him.The Shining is a superb piece of horror film-making, a tiring and emotionally burning movie and wears its horror genre credentials on its sleeve. Recently Channel 4 in the UK voted it the scariest film ever made. I don't know if I would go that far, I believe that The Exorcist deserves that title, but The Shining is not far behind. As thrilling and entertaining the film is, it is deeply unsettling, this, like The Exorcist, is a pure horror film and does what the horror genre can do so well when treated right, which is to take a mundane and realistic situation and to turn it into a story that makes the palms wet and the nails shorter. Like the best horror movies, The Shining is no mere popcorn entertainment, it is a trip into the darkness of the human condition. The fact that it is entertaining and thrilling to watch, doesn't detract from the fact that it is also a disturbing film.",10,0,1,2 May 2006
American Beauty," Truly, a film that is full of beauty.
","This is without doubt a fantastic film. May as well get the obvious hyperbole out of the way first. The directorial debut of Sam Mendes is assured and confident, exuding touches that one would easily associate with directors like David Lynch (the use of symbolism and scenes of a dream like surreal quality) and Robert Altman (the use of an ensemble cast). For a first timer this is one a fantastic debut, on a par with Reservoir Dogs for sheer brilliance.It would be easy to go on and on about Mendes and his being a first time director but it is what goes on inside his film that really matters. The tale of Lester Burnham and his last year alive is one that you can really sink your teeth into, whether it be the symbolism of the red roses or the way everyone reacts to their life as if it is disastrous when it is not. This is a tale full of irony. Lester (played with  great aplomb, wit and style by Kevin Spacey) decides to give his mundane life meaning. Quitting his job and living a life of pushing weights, listening to Pink Floyd and smoking dope, his life appears to be gaining a sense of enjoyable meaning when everyone else is miserable and falling apart. Or so it would seem. Look closer cries the tag line on the poster and look closer is what you should do. Everyone is not miserable, at least those who think they are. His daughter Jane (the sublime Thora Birch) appears to be the usual bitchy daughter and she appears miserable, but by finding love with next door neighbor Ricky,  her life finds purpose in an otherwise chaotic surrounding. Likewise, Carolyn (Annette Benning), Lester's wife, who finds temporary happiness with Buddy Kane, a rival estate agent. Then there is Jane's best friend, Angela, who appears to live the perfect life, but who it turns out is still a virgin and is more wholesome than she lets out. She is living a life that we see makes her miserable when she tries to stop Jane from running of with Ricky. Likewise Ricky's father Frank, a staunch Nazi supporter who is as confused as everyone else.This, of course, leads to disaster at the end. Lester is killed at the moment where he experiences true happiness for the first time in his life, when he realizes that he loves his family after all, and it is his wife and daughter he really wants, not Angela. To say  this is perfect cinema would be an understatement. Never has a film been released that contains such vicious, vile characters, yet have an oddly uplifting emotional center and a conclusion that should be depressing but is oddly optimistic. At the end everybody is left with unhappiness at the end. Carolyn loses her husband, Jane loses her father, Ricky's mother is left with her husband,  yet despite what happened to him Lester is in peace, evident by a beautiful voice over from Spacey who tells us how much he has come to realize that life was always worth living. Without doubt this is one of the most superb pieces of film making I have ever seen. Backed by a mainstream studio and going on to Oscar success, this is a case of a beautiful and intelligent film being excepted for what it is. Beautiful and intelligent.",10,0,1,1 December 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the finest sequels ever made.
","From beginning to end this is a fantastic film, a sequel that truly betters what was really considered to be a film that couldn't be bettered. James Cameron has really increased everything here. Budget, special effects as well as the stakes in his fictional universe. Whereas Sarah, the mother, was the target,  now it's John himself and the story that takes place is superb showing that Cameron truly is the master of the Hollywood blockbuster, a writer/director who can mix big budget thrills and spills with brilliant character drama, which he does so exceedingly well here and this is not seen better than when we see the character development of the Terminator itself which stands as the best part of the film, apart from the action sequences that is. It may not be saying much, but this is undeniably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best performance and I mean that really. Okay, so he plays a killing machine that cannot experience emotion and who basically talks with the same tone of voice throughout the entire film, but the development of the machine as he learns more about human pattern and behavior is fantastic. Watching the father/son bond develop between John and his protector is superb drama and big Arnie responds well to it. From learning to smile, to learning catchphrases such as 'hasta la vista baby' right down to his realization why human beings cry, Arnie has never been better than he is here, and in those final moments when he tells John he knows now why humans cry before having Sarah terminate him,  Arnie has never been better. Cameron can really get a great performance out of the Oak and it's never been seen better until you see it here. In saying that the rest of the cast is pretty darn good too. Linda Hamilton puts in a career best performance too while Robert Patrick has star quality and quality actor written all over him (the utterance of the phrase 'get out' has never been more creepy, trust me'), while Edward Furlong is a revelation as John, and along with Arnie he nails those final moments with great aplomb.Coupled with all of this, the action sequences twelve years on are still superb, as are the special effects which have not dated too much over the years. The truck chase and the helicopter pursuit are still fantastic staples of the action genre and truly set Cameron out as the best action film director working today. All of the elements of this film make this a truly magical film and goes to show that great special effects and a great story that always make a great film. Take notice George Lucas.",10,1,1,27 October 2003
Spider-Man," Amazing Fun!
","Hugely entertaining from the outset, Spiderman is very much the big screen Marvel equivalent to DC's Superman. Both have  a bright outlook, both films aren't too dark, in the way that Tim Burton and Bryan Singer would do it, while there is a sense of humor along the way that does not border on camp (take note Joel Schumacher). Where Sam Raimi succeeds, in much the same way that Richard Donner, Richard Lester, Tim Burton and Bryan Singer succeeded too, is that while remaining faithful to the source material, he isn't afraid to put a little of his own spin into it, so we get some of the trademarks such as Bruce Campbell and at times some horrifying violence (not to horrifying mind, the film is a 12 certificate), but he retains the charm of the comic book and does a faithful adaptation of the source, especially with regards to the back story of the character, which is where this film works the most. Yes the action sequences are spectacular, but it is the smaller character moments where Raimi really succeeds at, surprising considering he is the film maker behind the Evil Dead films.The portrayal of Peter's love for Mary Jane is superbly done, further enhanced by Tobey Maguire. Sure he may not look the part of Spiderman, but he is Spiderman. This quirky piece of casting works in much the same way that Micheal Keaton did in the first Batman movie. He may not fully look the part, but playing it can be a different matter. Maguire is superb, particularly when playing out the reason that he becomes Spiderman, in a scene that does not flinch away from the most important part of the back story of the comic book. Likewise Willem Dafoe is wonderfully over the top as the Green Goblin. While not immediately a scene stealer in the way Jack Nicholson was in Batman or Ian McKellen in X Men or even Gene Hackman in Superman, Dafoe is an actor's actor and the excellence of the scenes where his split personality comes to the surface are over the top in a wonderful comic book movie way. As for Kirsten Dunst, how could you not fall in love with her. Talented and beautiful, like Maguire this is perfect casting and Raimi has good ingredients to work with here.When Parker does become Spiderman the film dips into traditional comic book fare, he saves damsels in distress while the Green Goblin makes his a choice between saving M-J or some kids to which he does both, but nevertheless the film remains constantly entertaining and Raimi isn't afraid to be that little bit brutal with the final confrontation between good guy and bad guy. Even better is that while the ending is open, it doesn't have the the aura of sequel hunting that X Men had. In fact it is more in line with Batman and Superman. Parker will always be around to fight evil and the film's story is resolved.The film is fantastically entertaining, never bores and is undeniably one of the best comic book adaptations to hit the screen. Raimi has got it perfect and I for one cannot wait for the sequel.",8,0,1,28 October 2003
Die Hard 2," Great sequel!
","To anybody who has been put of watching this terrific film by bad reviews, don't because you are missing a terrific action film and a great sequel that is a worthy follow on from the first film. What is established here is that we are not getting a continuation of the first film's story; McClane finds himself facing a new terrorist threat and this time it truly is a terrorist threat. No hiding a robbery  here, the baddies are sheer evil terrorists willing to do anything to get what they want.  What is so great about this set up is that director Renny Harlin and writer Steven De Souza get to have fun by drawing comparisons to the events of this film and the first installment. It's Christmas Eve, Holly is on a plane flight back to John, but terrorists are threatening to crash planes unless a drug lord being transported  to America is handed over to them and John McClane finds himself in the middle of it all.  Harlin uses this as the main thrust of the film's humor. McClane finds himself having to crawl through air vents again and remarks at his exasperation at how the same thing can happen to the same guy twice, Holly asks John at the end 'why does this keep happening to us', and McClane is told that he  is the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. The humorous angle is dealt with fantastically.The action sequences, coming from the man who would go on to give us Cliffhanger and The Long Kiss Goodnight are spectacular, although there is more of a leaning towards explosions and spectacular death scenes than the building of suspense that we had in the first film, but Harlin had a bigger budget than McTiernan did for Die Hard, so that may be the reason. In light of 9/11 the film does have the sense that it wouldn't even be made today. The controversial moment where William Sadler's villain crashes a commercial jet to teach McClane and Dulles Airport a lesson is shocking, from the use of imagery (we see the passengers screaming for their lives) to the (admittedly very well done) shot of the plane exploding, it does leave one with a churned stomach. Add to this other sadistic moments such as the icicle in the eye, one of the villains going through an airplane engine and a bad guy being flattened by scaffolding and there is a slightly more darker air to the action sequences. McTiernan wanted to make the violence in Die Hard almost goofy and cartoon like, one gets the impression Harlin is out for realism.In saying that is a fine action film. Willis is his usual charismatic self, Bedelia and Atherton make a nice comedic double act, Dennis Franz is a wonderfully vindictive airport police officer and Sadler a chilling villain, if admittedly not as memorable as Alan Rickman. This is fun stuff and is hugely enjoyable. Terrific.",10,0,3,26 January 2004
Independence Day," Brilliantly Entertaining.
","I saw this movie when I was twelve and I remember I couldn't wait to see it. As a twelve year old it was the greatest film ever made. The mixture of aliens, explosions and Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum blowing up the mother ship all made up for my favorite film at a young age. While it may no longer hog the top spot (I have grown up a bit since then) the film is still a favorite of mine, owning it on video and DVD and I still find it great fun to watch. Okay, okay, so the American patriotism is a little overdone at the end, but Jeff Goldblum is great value for money, especially when playing the cocky scientist who is destined to be right and mixing it up with a cockier Will Smith this has the basis to be a fun film which it is.While the special effects are what the film relies on the most, it is the affectionate tribute to the many genres that inspired Emmerich and Devlin that makes this a joy to watch. Clearly in love with alien invasion films and disaster films from the 50's and 70's, they have ever cliche in the book thrown into the film, from the frightening, although fantastically done, alien attack that sees some of the most famous landmarks in America being blown up, through to the self sacrifice of a character through to the death of many a loved one who are merely one dimensional characters who serve no purpose other than to be killed and cause a gamut of emotions, Emmerich and Devlin have done their job well. The film is affectionate to the genre's it is paying tribute to and in doing so they have created one of the most entertaining Hollywood blockbusters in many a year. While the film would seem to have a lot in common more with a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay collaboration (explosions, explosions and some more explosions), they do in a less excessive mode and in doing so do create some funny and moving character moments. Goldblum and Judd Hirsch have some fantastic scenes together, while Bill Pullman's president having to watch his wife die is genuinely sad, never have the word sleeping seem so weepy.It is the action scenes where this film comes to life and boy does Emmerich know how to put on a good show. From the aforementioned attack scene to the the retaliation of human kind, the film is a fast paced fun ride that never lets up and never has a dull moment. It may be corny and it may be a film made for twelve year old boys, but seven years have passed since the film was released and I'm going to admit it. I still love it.",10,4,10,27 October 2003
Batman Begins," Puts the series back on track. A masterpiece!
","After the bitter disappointment (understatement, I know) of Batman and Robin, something special was needed to prove that Batman could still be a viable movie series. This is the film that not only proves it, but puts would be pretenders such as Spiderman and X-Men in the shade with a superb piece of film-making that puts script and characters above action sequences (although there are plenty of those too). What is so satisfying about the movie is that while Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly putting his own statement on the character, he has also reverted more to the style of the first Batman movie of 1989, by making the universe are characters inhabit a plausible and real one, even in the presence of bat-caves, gadgets and over the top villains. The city of Gotham doesn't look like the neon lit cartoon world of the Joel Schumacher years, instead looking like a real world, one that could exist. It is these types of choices that make the film a joy.The casting is pure perfection. While Michael Keaton was a great Bruce Wayne/Batman, his casting was quirky and strange, even though he got over those problems masterfully. Christian Bale on the other hand is quite possibly the perfect embodiment of Bruce Wayne/Batman, he has comic book good looks (black hair, square jaw line) and like Michael Keaton, has a psychotic look in his eye while at the same time having a sense of humor that is a joy to watch and laugh with. Likewise Michael Caine as Alfred. Initially I would have preferred Anthony Hopkins, but Caine ends up as the better choice putting in a performance as touching as it is boisterous and hilarious. Add to this Gary Oldman as Sergeant Gordon (the future Commisoner of Gotham City), Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow and Katie Holmes as the love interest, and not forgetting about Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Batman Begins is a glorious piece of summer film entertainment. I left the cinema in a buzz I haven't felt since the first Matrix film, everything works so well here, the dialog, the script, acting, direction, even the music from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is fantastic, with Zimmer taking the action cues and Howard the more intimate moments.As all good comic book movies should, the end only leaves us with more (espcially a mention of one of Batman's most famous villains, which I won't give away here) and its good to know a sequel will be with us in the next few years. All that I ask of Nolan and Warner Brothers is not to screw it up this time because this could be the beginning of something special indeed.Bravo Christopher Nolan, bravo Christian Bale.",10,2,2,28 June 2005
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Great Dino Fun!
","I have to say, I really, REALLY, enjoy this film. Sure it ain't art, and after Schindler's List, that may be considered a bit of a disappointment for critics and followers of Spielberg, but boy is this film great fun and not only that, the film follows its own sense of fun too. Check out T-Rex destroying San Diego and the homages thrown throughout to the Godzilla movies as well as a cameo from the film's scriptwriter being eaten. I'm sorry, but for me this is representative of what going to the movies is sometimes about. Having a fun time. I'd almost go out on a limb and say it was better than the first film.Okay that may be a bit strong, but I find there so much more to enjoy here. As much as I love the first film, there is a wee bit of sentimentality about it. Having the child hater turn into a father figure played a big part in the first film, but as Spielberg has upped the ante here as well as include more dinosaurs and more elaborate action sequences there isn't as much room for the 'family' margin, even though that gets a look in too. Nope, this is not about Spielberg the filmmaker, this is about Spielberg the entertainer. He's not aiming for Oscars here, instead it's all about creating a thrill packed ride which is what we get. There are many a classic action-horror moment here. The moment where all that separates the character of Sarah (Julianne Moore) from imminent death is a sheet of glass is one of the most nerve wracking moments committed to film, while the Raptor attack in the field is undeniably sheer genius and the ending where San Diego gets flattened by the T-Rex itself is so much fun and contains so much going on that it's worthwhile watching the film again.With an increase in the violent content (how this only got a PG in Britain is beyond me, a 12 or even 15 would have been more appropriate) this is indicative at the same time of Spielberg's darker sensibilities coming out of him. Unlike Jurassic Park there are no scenes set in blazing sun shine, instead we get lots of rain and dark clouds covering each moment, while Kaminski's photography enhances the more darker look of the film. The death scenes are more elaborate here. Why have one T-Rex eat a hapless victim when you can have two and when you have a waterfall why not have blood ooze from it when a victim is eaten. Yep, it's almost like Temple Of Doom all over again.I know the film has its haters, but this is one film that I find hugely entertaining. While the novelty factor of the CGI does not flood the film so much here, the more ruthless action sequences more than makes  up for it. It's a Hollywood blockbuster. It is supposed to be fun.",10,8,16,28 October 2003
X-Men: The Last Stand," Surprisingly x-cellent.
","Having had the director of the first, highly terrific installments replaced by a man whose biggest hits include Jackie Chan/Chris Tucker comedies, it would be easy to get cold feet over whether or not the third installment of the X Men series could hold sway and keep the quality control over one and two in place. I am pleased to report that it does, but it isn't without its faults though. First of all the obvious has to go out of the way, Ratner does a terrific job as director. Although I would have liked to have seen Bryan Singer come back, although to be fair it would have deprived us of a terrific comeback for the Man of Steel, Ratner does do a better job than his 'rent a hack' reputation would have prepared your for. He stages the action sequences terrifically well and the film rattles along at a great pace (from my recollection I think the film runs under two hours, a rarity for a lot of today's blockbusters). If there are two flaws I can point out at with him, it would be that he does lack some of the visual prowess of Singer, who would do some innovative, almost comic book like tricks with the camera and being a director who specializes in somewhat more conventional action pictures, he seems more interested in blowing things up quite spectacularly than mixing in the subtext, something X Men's one and two did so well, although there are hints that Magneto is being compared to the terrorist threat that is present in the real world (a news report of Magneto on a home video reading from a statement seems influenced from similar videos made by Bin Laden).As always the performances from everyone are superb, added gravitas coming from Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart as always and Hugh Jackman, as always, is great fun as Wolverine, mixing tongue in cheek humour, sarcasm, bitterness and a softness that marks him out as a superb talent. Halle Berry gets more to do as Storm, although she is somewhat overtaken on screen by the three leading men whilst Famke Janssen is mesmerizing as the darker, more psychotic Jean Grey. It's this plot line that really impresses, possibly more so than the mutant cure strand of the story that is really the main thrust of the plot. Whilst the latter wields some of the cod-political and ethical dilemmas that are the bread and butter of the series, whilst also furthering the action sequences culminating in a quite spectacular conclusion on Alcatraz, it is the Phoenix story that audiences and fans will find their hearts in more. Originally set to be the main story when Singer was developing the script, it takes a back seat to the cure strand, but it does hold the attention throughout. Janssen is terrific when playing it in a psychotic manner, anyone who has seen Goldeneye or her terrific turn in Nip/Tuck will testify, but mixing it in with a the broken personality of Jean gives the film more pathos than is really hinted at and impacts greatly on one of the most devastating scenes in the film which sees a long standing character killed off.Other characters and performers are not quite so lucky. Rogue, despite a great angle being taken with the mutant cure story line through her character, is effectively written out halfway through the film before resurfacing two minutes before the credits roll. Likewise Mystique and Cyclops, wasting the talents of Marsden, whose never had much to do anyway, and Stamos, who along with Ian McKellan with films one and two, has always ran away with the show. It all builds to a satisfyingly action packed and emotional climax, the film overall is great fun and terrific. It may lack the subtleties and sub-text that Singer brought to it before, but in my estimation it could have been worse and to my surprise it ended up being a lot better than I thought it would be.",8,0,4,3 November 2007
Ghostbusters," My favorite film as a child and still brilliant today!
","I have special affection for this film. When I was a youngster, growing up between the ages of four and ten, this was my favorite film. I loved the whole Ghostbusters thing. I loved the sequel, the cartoon series, I had to have the toys and merchandise every Christmas, you name it. Strangely, as I have gotten older, I find myself appreciating the film more and more. When I was a child I loved it for the special effects, the gadgets and the ghostbusting especially. Nowadays I love it for the same reasons, but now that I'm older I find myself appreciating the dialog which is some of the funniest committed to a film, the oddball humor, like Venkman's line about dogs and cats living together and the in jokes, like Slimer being the ghost of John Belushi and Venkman rubbing his hand at glee at the thought of the money to be made from the merchandising of the ghostbusters brand. Not only that, but some 80's hairstyles aside, the film as aged remarkably well. My cousin who is five years old has developed a love for the whole Ghostbusters thing, showing that this is truly worthy of being branded one of the most successful films ever made.Unlike many of today's blockbusters which are humorless and pompous thinking that they are serious films and forgetting about any sense of fun along with the complicated visual effects, Ghostbusters is funny and a fun paranormal movie. The set pieces are superb as we see the Ghostbusters going up against Slimer, Gozer and, undeniably the classic movie moment of the 80's, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. For a film made in 1984 the climax is very well done and looks exceedingly realistic, without any hint of clues as to the fact that it is a special effect. This is what going to the cinema should be all about. Fun with a capital F. All the actors get into it with great comedic aplomb. Bill Murray, one of the finest comedy actors to grace the screen, is superb as Peter Venkmen who gets the best lines in the film as well as the funniest moments. Just check out the 'there is no Dana, only Zool' moment. Murray's priceless reaction to Dana Barrett's possession is one of the most side splitting moments I have ever seen. In fact, the casting is pretty much spot on. As well as Murray, we have co writers Dan Akyroyd and Harold Ramis sharing the spotlight as the fellow Ghostbusters, Sigourney Weaver making a wonderful damsel in distress, Rick Moranis is almost scene stealing as her nerd of a  neighbor who becomes possessed himself, while Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts both put in wonderfully sardonic supporting roles who get their chances to shine.Add to this one of the best theme tunes and a truly apocalyptic finale, it is no surprising that this was the biggest film of 1984. A summer blockbuster with humor, trills, spills and some of the best special effects money could buy at the time, this is truly a genuine classic and is one of the best Hollywood blockbusters ever made.",Null,168,194,25 February 2004
Meet Joe Black," A gorgeous film.
","A three hour film about death. It doesn't sound like much when you say it like that, but trust me, Meet Joe Black is an outstanding film and is without doubt one of the most underrated little gems I have ever seen. The film is beautiful in every regards; the photography, the sets, the music and the performances, especially the performances. The last time Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt were on screen together it was the equally sublime Legends of the Fall, here it is another sublime film and once again they are putting in some of their best work. The characters that they play, Bill Parrish and Death, bring out a fantastic chemistry between the two performers, especially in the more comedic moments when they two are getting to know each other. However, while death is the main theme of the film, director Martin Brest remembers to filter optimism into his wonderful tale in the shape of a love story between Parrish's daughter (played by the beautiful Claire Forlani) and Death himself. This results in one of the most gorgeous coupling in recent years as well as one of the most erotically intense love scenes I have ever watched.Director Brest presents the film in a more artistically filtered view than most other directors might have done. The love scene is done without nudity with close ups on the actors throughout. The striking presentation of the lighting in the film is also fantastic, with a lovely golden glow pouring of the screen and lastly Thomas Newman's music is quite simply marvelous. Films like The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption and American Beauty which have featured music by this outstanding composer have been enhanced by the haunting, lyrical and moving melodies he has composed and this film is no exception. The mixture of piano and orchestra builds to an uplifting and emotional pull that cements his position as one of the best music composers working in modern film today.The three hour running time would appears to be problematic, but alas it is not. In fact like another sweeping romantic epic, Titanic, you will not feel the time going in. The three hours fly by and not only that, like the Oscar winning epic, this is a film that makes one instantly want to re-watch it again and again. Meet Joe Black is a wonderful mixture of comedy, romance and drama and is done exceedingly well. Brad Pitt puts in one of his finest performances as Death finds himself enchanted by human emotions and then finds himself making a deeply human choice at the end of the film and then there is Hopkins. One of cinema's finest actors no matter what he is in, he shows with his complex range of emotions in his performance there is more to him  than playing Hannibal Lecter. His performance here restrained and quite frankly very well done. It is perhaps one of his best acting performances. His Shakespeare background obviously coming in handy for a film that contains many a Shakespearean like moment.The film, while not a flop, was not the box office hit that was expected, especially considering the main casting, but if you can make up your own mind, do watch Meet Joe Black. This is a wonderful film and is a personal favorite of mine.",10,516,573,17 November 2003
The Dark Knight," Dark indeed.
","I remember going to see this film, at the time of writing that was almost a year ago. The cinema was packed to the last available seat and everyone there seemed to be enjoying the film immensely, myself included. You could hear murmurings when something major happened and everyone shuffling with anticipation when the action sequences started. I have to say it was easy to get blown away by the film, as summer blockbusters go, this one has it all. A comic book character for the hero, a truly spectacular villain, gasp, horror, a great plot and one that is at times quite complex seeing as it takes in aspects of terrorism, organized crime and finance, wonderful supporting characters, great actors and some of the best action sequences in many a year (Hong Kong, the car chase, the boats and the hospital). It was after watching the film that I realized something and that was just how dark the whole film is and I mean it is dark, pitch black. If Batman Begins was a comic book movie through and through, albeit an intelligent one, the optimistic first act bathed in a dark orange glow of fighting today for a better tomorrow, then The Dark Knight is genuinely the darker second, this time in a blue glow carried along by the message that sometimes just fighting for what is right is never enough, that bad things will happen no matter how hard we fight for it because no matter what good you try to do there will always be someone who just wants to watch the world burn, who will kill those who are good and innocent and corrupt the seemingly incorruptible. It amazes me that a film as dark and pessimistic as this has become the second most successful film in history after Titanic (then again that film features a sinking boat with a high death count so maybe mainstream tastes are darker than I ever considered).I don't want to seem I'm knocking it, because I'm not. Truth is, like Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan has created a perfect film once again, a near flawless work of art that roots his re-imagined Batman universe in the real and plausible, it's just here things aren't just as entertaining as they were last time, at least not overtly so. Begins felt like a comic book adaptation, but an intelligent one, a film rooted in the comic book nevertheless with it's love for ninja vigilantes, creepy villains and wonderful action sequences taking in trains and tumblers. Although a lot of those elements are still there, this time they are rendered with a pitch black view. None more black than its villain. It has been said in many places but it must be said again, Heath Ledger is terrific and watching this film you cannot help but feel gutted that we will never see this talent again. His Joker is mesmerizing, a darkly humorous take on the character, like Jack Nicholson, but one rendered not through a comic book frame work, but one more real and relevant, for what is the Joker of Christopher Nolan's imagination but a terrorist, a metaphor for the villains of our world, the ones who truly do blow things up, kill and stab. Is any coincidence that the Joker uses knifes, just as the 9/11 hijackers were said to?All this elevates the film above a summer blockbuster, albeit one that many of us flocked to, again and again (I admit, I seen it twice on the big screen and have watched it many times on DVD).It's nearly a perfect film, it's just that the darkness can be a bit overwhelming, like being hit with a baseball over the head for two and a half hours, but there is a lot to love here, with amazing performances from everyone, including the much criticised Bale, although special word must go out to Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and, for reasons I won't get into, out of respect for the two people on the planet who have yet to see the film, Aaron Eckart, who deserved an Oscar nomination as well. It's wonderful stuff, and for a film as long as it is, it never drags, the pace is unrelentless, especially in the second half as it builds and builds to a truly superb climax, one that leaves you gagging for a third movie in a way that is truly even better, if that is possible, than Batman Begins did when leaving you chumping at the teeth for this one. Let's just hope the real star of the Batman franchise, Chris Nolan returns, but if he does, I would like to see that orange glow make a return with it.",10,0,4,18 July 2009
Once Upon a Time in America," Well Worth The Running Time!
","Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In America is undeniably a masterpiece. A superb film on every level, it feels like the brother of The Godfather Films. While both this film and the Godfather Part II make use of the flashback structure and both feature Robert De Niro, all comparisons end there as this is a vastly different film. Yes they are both gangster films, but this is a different kettle of fish. Whereas the main theme of the Godfather films is that of family, here we deal with the role of friendship in the life of the gangster and how betrayal can lead to bitter recriminations and heartache. However it doesn't just tell the story of gangster betrays friends, oh no, it goes deeper than that. We go into a world where you question the events depicted and the role many characters play. This is a film with no easy answers and with it comes difficult questions. This is essentially the more deeper cousin of The Godfather films. We come to question whether or not the sequences in the 1960's are real. Is it just a dream concocted  by De Niro in the Opium den. It this a possible future, but one that is only possible. What about the brief case. Whereas in Pulp Fiction the case is more of a running joke, here it seems like a plot point that we have missed all of a sudden, while one also has to question why Noodles goes on to rape the woman he supposedly loves in one of the film's most shocking sequences.To be honest I don't think Once Upon A Time In America is as good as The Godfather films, but it is a worthy film to be lined alongside Coppola's legacy. The story by Leone and his direction are first class, De Niro shows us why he is considered by many to be the finest actor working in American cinema today, while James Woods proves that no one can play a psychopath like himself. Then there is Ennio Morricone's music. Sublime and perfect, like The Godfather films, Once Upon a Time In America is complimented with a fine music score that adds gravitas to an already fine film.Every part of this film is superb. The origin of the friendship between Max and Noodles is wonderfully done, the middle time frame sequences were we see the release of Noodles from prison and his reintegration with his friends and how it all leads to the ultimate act of betrayal and the later stages were an older Noodles reflects in the 60's all work well together. This film could have been a long, meandering sprawling bore fest, but instead it is one of the finest films committed to celluloid. However, it is not a film that is easily recommended. Nearly four hours long, very violent, containing a horrifying rape scene and an ending that  only leaves you with more question, I'm not surprised that many have been divided over it, but I love it. It is quite simply a work of art.",10,6,10,3 November 2003
Groundhog Day," Bill Murray at his best.
","This is one of my favorite films of all time. A wonderful little romantic comedy that is full of quirks, fantastic and zany humor, an eventually touching romantic sub-plot and Bill Murray putting in his best performance in a comedy film (only his recent turn in Lost in Translation is on a par with his performance here), this is as close as romantic comedies come to perfection. While the plot has been done on countless science fiction and fantasy television shows, from The Twilight Zone to The X Files, Star Trek to Buffy The Vampire Slayer, the concept works frequently well and does so here, working brilliantly due to the efforts of Harold Ramis behind the camera and script, alongside Danny Rubin on screenplay duties and the magnificent central performance of Bill Murray as Phil Connors, the egotistical and heartless reporter who, in the grand traditions of Hollywood, becomes a better man due to his predicament. While it is clear early on that this is where the story is going, the journey there is one of the most entertaining and downright funny comedies to be filmed. Phil's journey takes in the the emotional ranges of bewilderment, to confidence in using the time warp to his advantage (getting laid, stealing money from a bank van, trying to move in on his producer Rita (a beautiful Andie McDowell)) to depression that leads to many suicide attempts and eventually to acceptance, where he tries to right the wrongs of the day, from being nicer to Rita and his camera man Larry, to saving lives successfully (Buster, the Groundhog keeper) to sadly the not so successful (the old man in the street). Murray has always cornered the markets of either being sarcastic but lovable (Ghostbusters) to just plain nasty (Scrooged), but here he mixes in many personalities in his performance. How he goes from being sarcastic and nasty to a really nice guy is believably done and marks this out as his finest performance. How he genuinely comes to love Rita would have been hokey and sentimental in the hands of any other director or actor, but in the hands of Ramis and Murray it becomes a touching and life affirming comedy that is well worth repeat viewing. Adding to this wonderful mix is a terrific little music score from George Fenton (genuinely romantic and emotional in some cases), a lovely supporting role for Andie McDowell (who wouldn't fall in love with her after watching this film) and some of the finest comedy scenarios committed to film. Check out Phil reciting the answers on Jeopardy before the question is even asked, the repeated suicide attempts and not forgetting the car chase involving Phil allowing the Groundhog to drive. This is as close to perfection as a film can possibly be and is perfect for repeat viewing.",10,1,4,25 February 2004
Titanic," SUPREMELY WONDERFUL!
","James Cameron really knows how to put on a show. T-2, The Abyss, True Lies and Aliens, all of his films have been hugely enjoyable, rich in epic scope and emotional flavor. Whether it be science fiction or in this case an historical disaster film, he really knows how to create rich epic entertainment and with Titanic he has probably made his finest film artistically. Sure, there are  many who don't like the film , historians will go 'tut-tut' which they always do anyway at any film based on historical fact, but Cameron makes his interpretation of the Titanic disaster work so well, mainly because he knows how to tell a story really well and he is a master at creating suspense in his action sequences.The first half of Titanic in undeniably moving. The love story between Jack and Rose may have every cliche in the book (the jealous fiance, the evil mother in law, the tug of love between lover and family) but let me tell you Cameron can make these cliches really work here. The epic scale puts it above sheer soap opera and with fantastic performances from Winslet, Zane and even DiCaprio, Cameron really makes the love story work from a story telling point of view and a visual one. The way he presents the first kiss on the bow, to the drawing of a nude rose through to the love scene, Cameron makes his finest film, and if this were just a period love piece it would be enough, but as this is about the sinking of the Titanic he has more aces up his sleeve and he creates the most moving motion picture in many a decade. Not since the days of David Lean has a love story been presented in such a way, and when that iceberg comes, Cameron mixes love story and historical disaster in the most fantastic way which ensured that audiences responded in their droves.Sure this is not great art, it is a Hollywood blockbuster, one, like Gladiator (it too a fantastic film) that takes the audience back to the good old days when big budgeted blockbusters had a great plot as well as superb special effects, and with Cameron at the helm we are getting the best of both worlds. All of this culminates in some of the most moving scenes in a mainstream Hollywood film I have ever seen. They are not manipulative. They are well written.This is a superb film on every level. Well done James, you have done it again.",10,2,5,27 October 2003
The Godfather: Part III," Weakest of the three, but still brilliant.
","It really says something about a film when, even when it's the weakest of a trilogy, still manages to be a fantastic film too. While The Godfather Part III doesn't manage to scale the heights of the first two films, this still manages to be a powerful film and brings the story of the Corleone dynasty to a gut wrenching conclusion. The continuation of Michael's story, this time as an older man whose life has moved on to new areas since the second film has a lot to recommend it and it is truly not the disaster that many claimed it was when first released. The central performance of Al Pacino is extraordinary. Filmed in 1990, just when every other Pacino performance was all about screaming and shouting dialog, here he manages restraint as a man burdened with the guilty conscious of ordering the execution of his own brother, a piece of character development that leads to a brilliant moment where Pacino confesses his sins. Pacino's performance here is one of his best in his latter day career when every line of dialog he utters in any other film tends to be said with the volume turned up, but here he brings back that wonderful quality he had during the first two films as well as his career in the 70's.The rest of the cast is a highly mixed affair. Andy Garcia joins the cast as Vincent Corleone, the illegitimate son of Sonny and is superb. How his acting career floundered after this film is quite strange, but he settles into his character fantastically here. Good looking in the same way Pacino and De Niro were (sun tanned skin and thick dark hair), he looks the part and plays it fantastically. Being the son of Sonny the character has a fiery temper and Garcia plays it with the relish you would expect. When it comes to the romance with Michael's daughter, Garcia brings more of a Pacino/De Niro sensitivity to part, making it a wonderful hybrid of a performance that is fantastic to watch. Diane Keaton, once again, is superb as Kay and her scenes with Pacino are once again some of the highlights of the film. So, what makes the casting more mixed this time around? Well Sofia Coppola is the biggest weak link here. Looks wise she doesn't look like Pacino or Keaton and her acting ability is adequate at best. Original choice was Winona Ryder and it makes one quick to point out she would have been a better choice. Then there's George Hamilton as Michael's new lawyer, Tom Hagen having died off screen at some point. His performance is not bad, but he looks out of place in a film like this.In saying that, the script from Coppola and Puzo is once again marvelous, Coppola's direction is as assured as one would expect and the conclusion is shocking and downbeat. The fact that Michael dies alone gives the ending to the trilogy a very poignant and sad tone, more or less confirming that he was doomed to failure no matter what he tried to do with his life, his family and his business.This is still a fantastic film and makes this, overall, a superb trilogy.",8,0,2,28 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," THE BEST MOVIE OF 2003 (until Revolutions comes out possibly)
","When I went to see the first Matrix I left the cinema in a daze. I had never seen anything like it before in a movie theatre. Afterwards I became a huge fan of the film, of the characters and the philosophy that the Wachowski brothers were exploring through their highly imaginative universe. Being such a fan I awaited The Matrix Reloaded with baited breath. Would it be as good, were the negative reviewers on to something. Well, I shouldn't have worried. The Matrix Reloaded delivers and then some. This is without doubt the best blockbuster of the year. Forget X-2 and T-3, this film is how Hollywood blockbusters should be made. A great story (if one that will take multiple viewings to take in), characters we come to care about and an intelligence rarely seen, this is film making of the highest order.The film has a lot going against it. The film can have no clear beginning and no clear end (the cliffhanger is fantastic), but what it does is to continue with what we know and to explore the universe that is at the heart of the story and in doing so breaks all the rules and difficulties that second movies in trilogies have. The film begins a new storyline for the series, links it back to the original and leaves us gagging for the next installment. Performance wise the film is magnificent. Keanu Reeves shows us that he was born to play Neo as, like in the first film, he delivers the finest performance of his career. Okay so he may not be Olivier, but he is emotionally wonderful as Neo as the character must make some stark choices towards the end of the film (don't worry, I'm going to remain spoiler free) and must deal with what is troubling him throughout the film. His scenes with Carrie Anne Moss are also brilliant, the chemistry between them believable and the moment they share at the end of the film majestical. Laurence Fishburne brings a brilliant wealth of authoritarial faith and craziness to Morpheus (still my favourite character) in his quest to prove the prophecy regarding Neo. However, the film is stolen by Hugo Weaving. Agent Smith may not have as much to do with the story this time around, but the mixture of humour and evil that the character brings is hillarious yet disturbing. The character's ability to clone himself leads to many a great confrontation as well as the funniest action scene of the year.Along with Neo vs 100 Smith's fight, there is the car chase which, along with the aforementioned fight scene, are contenders for the classic scenes of the year. The car chase inparticular is stunning as it is violent, beautiful yet brutal. The awesome sight of two trucks coming together and cars spinning in the air in bullet time are awesome sights to behold and ensure that no other action film will be as good this year.The film is a classic, pure and simple. I am sorry but I love it. I have never enjoyed a film so much in my life. The negative reviewers can talk and write all they want about how bad the film is but I love it. The film is beautiful, gripping and stunning in every regard, from the action scenes to what has to be the most erotic love scene ever filmed. November cannot come fast enough, but be thankful folks that it is only six months and not another four years.",10,0,0,27 May 2003
Die Hard," Citizen Kane of action movies!
","It can not be underestimated enough, or even said enough, but Die Hard is one of the best Hollywood action thrillers ever made. Not only is it a gripping slice of suspense with many great set pieces and wonderful performances (yes, wonderful performances) by the cast that includes Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson, but it sets in stone many of the hallmarks that sixteen years later we all come to associate with big budget action movies. Action sequences involving machine guns and lots of destruction, check. A classy villain, check. The evil henchman with a hatred of the hero, check. A damsel in distress that has an emotional connection to the hero, in this case the wife, check. Lastly, a wise cracking hero that has a pun or a joke for every situation he gets out off, check. It's all here and would pave the way for two sequels (a third is in development) and action movies with the same motif. Only Die Hard does it so well. You can't accuse this film of being cliched, it created the cliches and they only became cliches when Arnie, Sly and Van Damme jumped on them.Bruce Willis makes an endearing action hero. He isn't the action hero who can sustain anything and survive everything unscathed. The character of John McClane is not muscle bound killing machine. He is just a man wanting to get his marriage back on track and not, instead, be trying to survive being killed by German hostage takers. Willis succeeds in making McClane a likable character, his mild mannered delivery of his dialog and magnificent manner of delivering one liners is spot on and it's no surprise he became a huge movie star after this. Alas the film is stolen by Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber the villain who is clever, vicious (witness the killing of Takagi) and great, great fun. So entertaining is Rickman's performance that somewhere deep inside you kind of want him to win. The cold blooded nature of Hans when he kills Takagi (one of the most graphic murders I have seen in a mainstream film) and Ellis through to the sense of awe when he and his fellow crooks break the fault of the Nakatomi building makes Hans one of the best villains in a film and marks Rickman out as a great actor.Director John McTiernan handles this all very well and has crafted a genuine classic action film which like The Matrix in later years, paved the way for a particular breed of action film. Spectacular, fun and gripping Die Hard is simply magnificent and sixteen years on is still a classic piece of the action genre.Yippe-ky-yay!",10,2,3,26 January 2004
War of the Worlds," Excellent, but surprisingly dark.
","Sitting down to watch War of the Worlds recently on DVD, I was expecting a return to the type of movie Spielberg would happily make throughout the eighties and nineties, before becoming the more experimental and more thoughtful filmmaker he is nowadays. To be honest what I was expecting was basically Jurassic Park with aliens, but what we get is something very, very different. Instead of it being a fun packed thriller with comic relief spread throughout, what one gets is something very dark, very serious and at times downright distressing. This is basically a big budget blockbuster from the man who has brought the world Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, not the man who brought us the Jurassic Park movies and Jaws. This is not to say that the film is bad, because it's not, in fact it is very, very good. Terrific in fact. It has all the usual aspects one should expect from a film like this such as budget busting special effects sequences, thrilling action set pieces and a genuine sense of terror, but what makes the film more than that is the way that instead of focusing on characters that are mere fantasy figures like a fictional president or smarter than thou scientists, what we get is the invasion of earth by extra terrestrials from one family, in this case the Ferrier family as played by Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin. The whole movie is played from their point of view and it makes it a treat. As Spielberg said in a lot of the publicity before the film was released, it is the biggest small film ever made. Like Batman Begins (the best film of summer 2005), more thought is put into the script and characters, so much so that we truly care about them. One truly distressing sequence has Cruise and his family being car jacked, but Fanning's character being left in the car and Cruise struggling to get to her. It is a moment of pure suspense, but one that is very distressing and almost full of despair.Technically the film is also superb, as it should be. The invasion sequences are some of the best put to film and best of all they don't look like special effects, something so rare in the movies of today. The tripods are terrifying, equally so the aliens themselves. Janusz Kaminski's photography is eye catching, as always. Much like his work in Minority Report and Saving Private Ryan, he goes more for a washed out look, with a tendency to shoot at a higher number of frames. It gives the movie a beautiful and ugly look, mostly at the same time.In a summer blockbuster season that has given us some of the best blockbusters in some years (Batman Begins, Sin City and Revenge of the Sith), War of the Worlds is more than equal to stand alongside some of the output of this year. It is in effect an old master doing what he does best. It amounts to one thrill packed ride.",8,0,1,22 November 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Masterful piece of horror and romance.
","There is a moment, around thirty minutes from the end of Francis Ford Coppola's film, when Mina Harker drinks from the blood of Count Dracula, an act that in the space of the same moment mixes brazen sexuality with blood curdling horror for the Count soon turns into a hideous bat like creature before dissolving into a pile of rats. It's a scene that encapsulates the romance, the beauty and the ugliness that is the cornerstone of the movie. The first thing I should really say about this film is how much I love it. To me it is a superb slice of film-making from a man who, at this point in his career and twenty years after the masterpiece that put him on the map, was not regarded as highly as he once was, at least in terms of the films he was currently making at that time. Certainly his previous film, prior to this, was the third installment of his Godfather series and that was a film that divided just about everybody based on whether or not it was a necessary film, to plot developments right through to the casting of the actress playing Al Pacino's daughter.Admittedly, and I will be the first one to say so, there are some issues here to be had. Some of the performances, or more so, the accents of some of the performers leave a lot to be desired, and yes, I'm looking at you Keanu Reeves. There are moments where one does expect an utterance of the line 'it's the Count dude', and while, thankfully, we never get that, it says a lot about said accent that no matter how many times one watches this film, you can't help but expect it. The whole aura of the film also feels over the top at times, the bloodletting, the overt sexuality (Sadie Frost's performance as Lucy comes across as a walking orgasm for most of the film, but this only seems to add to the fun considering the character comes across as nymphomaniac even before she becomes a vampire) and Anthony Hopkins' accent, but it works in the spirit of the film. What does work triumphantly well are the performances of the two leads. Gary Oldman, probably one of the best actors working today in film, and Winona Ryder, forever and always my favourite actress despite her inability, supposedly, to pay for her shopping, sell the love story of Dracula and Mina in a way that is almost heartbreaking beyond belief, with furtive glances, genuinely moving chemistry without resorting to playing it in a 'I want to remove your clothes now' sort of a way, is backed by sensitive direction from Coppola and a terrific music score that never intrudes and tells the audience how to feel, instead complimenting the emotion on screen. Winona's performance is beautiful and understated, as always, selling you her character's feelings and thoughts without overplaying it, whilst Oldman, seemingly, until the Christopher Nolan Batman films came along, forever and always playing villains, actually gives us a villain, although not as black and white as that description would suggest, that you want to root for, a man who has fallen into darkness based on an emotional loss that in turn places all those he comes into contact with into a similar place but who eventually fulfils a redemption in those haunting, final moments.The best performance could be held over for Francis Ford Coppola, here working as a director for hire in a studio film, but making it, as he always has done, through his own personal eyes. Instead of relying on modern technology available at the time, Coppola utilized old fashioned filming techniques and technology that was only available during the birth of cinema to present his vision of the tale. Old fashioned models, in camera trickery with not even a whiff of CGI. It's refreshing and original and brilliant. Of course not everyone will speak of the film in the same breath as the Corelone's or the Kurtz's but to me this is a crowning achievement, despite some bad judgments (again, I look to you Keanu Reeves), from a director who we all have to thank for the cinema that we have. At the time of writing (2009), horror has become a genre that is creatively dying, with torture porn and remakes of films that really shouldn't be remade when they were already good to begin with. Here we have an adaptation of a piece of work that has been made so many times, yet here it feels fresh and original, almost new. How many horror films, or even better yet, romantic films, can say that in this day and age?",10,0,2,16 June 2009
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Cements itself as a fine action series.
","So, you would think as the third film, Bruce getting a little bit older and the supposed ridiculousness of having a third bad day that Die Hard With A Vengeance would be a terrible film, trying aimlessly to do something new with an old hat, that it would struggle. Not at all. Die Hard With A Vengeance is a superb third installment of the franchise and in being so good it cements itself as one of the best film franchises. The story here is excellent, mixing in thrills and spills with the usual plethora of humor that we've come to expect as we watch McClane pit his wits against the brother of Hans Gruber, Simon. A stroke of genius is taking the Die Hard formula and applying it to the buddy cop genre as McClane teams up with Zeus, played fantastically by Samuel L Jackson. The initial hatred that turns to friendship is played out with great humor throughout, from the possible racist hate that they have to their arguing over the tasks Simon sets them (the best being over the women in St Ives and McClanes' curiosity over what they were doing).The plot is more topical that one would expect (the first two becoming more topical as time went on). The bombing plot appears to be ripped from the headlines, but the film is entertainment and as the film goes on we realize that Simon, like his brother, is not a mere terrorist, but an exceptional thief, with the twist being that Simon is after the gold of Fort Knox. McTiernan once again casts an English man in the villain role, with Jeremy Irons playing Alan Rickman's brother. Irons is great, although, like William Sadler in Die Hard 2, Irons is in the shadow of Rickman a tad, but he rises to the challenge enough playing a character of sheer genius and evil.Being made at a time when action movies rely on special/visual effects and explosions, Die Hard With A Vengeance is something unique, somewhat. Yes there are plenty of spectacular action sequences (the train bombing and the Central Park trip being highlights) but McTiernan knows that these films rely on nice character development and humor as well as an entertaining plot to make the film work and that is what we get here. There are some interesting twists to the narrative and the chemistry between Willis and Jackson is great. If the fourth film ever gets made they should bring back Zeus as this could put the franchise into a new gear. The buddy element works fantastically as the bickering and bantering between the two characters makes the film so much fun to watch. I love these films and the third one is terrific. Of course there are many debates over which of the sequels are the best, but I believe that they are both great. The third one ensures that this will remain a classic series and I hope that the fourth one (if it gets made that is) will retain the integrity of this entertaining and fun series.",10,1,1,27 January 2004
The Green Mile," Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful.
","I love this film, I really, really love it. I don't care about the three hour running time, it flies in for me. It's a prison drama from Frank Darabont and stars Tom Hanks, James Cromwell, Doug Hutchison, Michael Clarke Duncun, David Morse and Gary Sinise. I think this is perfect. The film is moving, spiritual and heavy with religious symbolism and metaphor. It is deeply interesting and weaves a captivating tale of murder and death, healing and resurrection. While the film doesn't have the overlying sense of perfectionism that The Shawshank Redemption had (Darabont's major break is too good a film to better), there is no denying that this is a worthy follow up to a what is a modern day masterpiece. The film is based on a novel by Stephen King and brilliantly it develops like one. The first hour is pretty slow. Very little seems to happen and Darabont, like a master novelist, takes time in developing the characters that are centered around the plot before actually kick starting it. We are introduced to Edgcombe (Hanks), evil Percy (Hutchison, stealing the film with a portrayal of sheer brutality) easy going Brutus (Morse), charming Warden Hal Moores and his dying wife, Melinda. We see how all these characters lives are to be impacted by convicted murderer John Coffey, a man convicted of killing two school girls, but who is more of a gentle giant and seems to have the capability of healing people (he takes away Edgcombe's bladder problems and brings a mouse back from the dead). It is the way that these characters develop over the second two hours of the film and how the event impact on their lives that make this a fantastic film.Darabont's handling of the subject matter is superb. This is a deeply moving film, but never, and I mean never, is there a hint of sentimentality about the proceedings. In fact Darabont is prone to making the film a tad more darker and disturbing. An execution gone wrong and the realization as to what really happened to the two girls that Coffey's was accused of murdering give the film a slightly more horrific edge, but then again this is based on a novel by Stephen King so certain aspects are sure to be disturbing in any case. When all is said and done, this is not a horror film. It is an emotional film, one with a raw power to move. With haunting music from Thomas Newman (one of the best composers working today), one of Hanks' best performances and an ending that is equally optimistic but downbeat, this all results in a tremendous film that quite simply wonderful.",10,1,3,1 December 2003
Vanilla Sky," A rarity. A Hollywood movie with a heart and a brain.
","This is one of those movies for me that gives me a buzz on how perfect cinema can be when it wants to be. Films that have fallen into this philosophy are The Matrix, The Shawshank Redemption, Batman Begins and this film, Vanilla Sky. Clever, intellectual and deeply, deeply moving, this is in my opinion the best film that Cameron Crowe has made and features the finest performance of Tom Cruise's career, more so that Magnolia and Jerry Maguire (even though I love those two films too). It's just that this is a film that you can really bite into, read into, enjoy and interpret in your own way. It's a surprise that this film is like that. It is to all intents and purposes a Hollywood thriller almost, but it transcends that and becomes almost as much of a personal experience for the viewer as it obviously was for Crowe. Crowe directs and writes the movie as the master-crafts man he is, almost in a similar way that Spielberg (who makes a cameo appearance near the start of the movie) and Hitchcock have done with their own films. Everything about this film is right, there is not a single thing wrong with it. From the performances of everyone, from Cruise to Cruz, Jason Lee, Tim Spall and Noah Taylor, to Nancy Wilson's terrific score (the acoustic guitar theme that plays throughout is deeply haunting and moving) and the terrific choices of songs for the soundtrack (one that is right up there with Pulp Fiction and Top Gun), the film is perfect in the extreme, so much so that you simply want to shout from the heavens to everyone that will listen how good it is. The tour de force of the film is the emotions it conveys, because this is quite simply the saddest and poignant film that I have ever seen. I admit, I almost cried my eyes out at the end when David has to chose between going back to his dream world or taking a chance on the real world, one without his beloved Sophia and his vanilla sky. In any other movie this final scene would have been destabilized with lesser hands and possibly have dived into a world of schmaltz and sickening sentimentality, but Crowe keeps it real, as real as a twist taking the movie 150 years into the future can be. That final moment between Cruise and Cruz is the most perfect moment in mainstream cinema.Words cannot describe how much I love this movie. It is perfect, it probes the brains, strains the heart and proves that in Hollywood there will always be room for thought provoking and daring cinema.",10,1,3,23 August 2005
Iron Man," The light to show us the way.
","Yes, I know, the title to this review is a quote from Richard Donner's Superman The Movie, but there's a reason for that, and I am going to get to it, so bare with me.In a summer dominated by the darkness of, well, The Dark Knight, it may be hard to remember than a month of or two before it we were all basking in the universe of another comic book character, a multi millionaire, too, and, what a coincidence, a character who uses his quite considerable wealth to turn himself into a superhero. All similarities end there (don't worry comic book fans, this is not a review of compare and contrast proportions). For as The Dark Knight falls into a darker and darker pit of despair, terrorism metaphors and increasingly dark plot twists and even darker cliffhanger ending, Jon Favreau instead creates a world of blue skies, brightly coloured costumes (well, for the hero anyway), witty dialogue and, above all else, a lovely atmosphere of fun. Iron Man is, pure and simple, unadulterated fun, amazing when you consider that a good half hour of the film takes place in war torn Afghanistan, with the lead character in the hands of characters who are essentially terrorists. Of course, if the film was in other hands, this would lead to many a darker moment, probably using the comic book genre and lead character as a means to explore modern day warfare in the war on terror. Not Favreau. God bless Jon Favreau because what he chooses instead to do is have fun, lots of it.I have a confession to make. I didn't get to see this film until recently. At the time of writing I only watched the movie on DVD for the first time the night before. Another thing, I loved The Dark Knight. I levelled some mild criticism at its darkness, but loved the movie nevertheless, but here, we get something that is positively giddy, funny and very, very enjoyable. I can't believe I missed it on the big screen, because this is great, and as a sci-fi adventure/comic book adaptation, it's got everything that I love to see in a Hollywood blockbuster of this nature. Imaginative action, funny dialogue, humour whilst retaining an ability to keep the film serious so it can remain engaging and great acting. The latter is particularly impressive. I know it has been said by many elsewhere, but let it be said again, primarily because I want to say it, Robert Downey Jr is fantastic. If played right this should be a comeback of John Travolta/Pulp Fiction proportions. He was always an actor that I liked (please check out Hearts and Souls if you have a chance) and here he brings that cheeky, comedic quality he always has, but filters it through a wonderfully engaging heroic complex. Quite simply he plays Tony Stark in such a way that you want him to be a hero, you want him to make the right choices and by God you want him to save the day. There are no Christian Bale style brooding moments here. Tony Stark is a lot like the movie itself, it's a hell of a lot of fun.I still haven't mentioned Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges or Terrence Howard, but they all put in good work too, particularly Gwyneth, the will they/won't they chemistry between her and Robert is lovely and played almost in a 1940's screwball comedy way. Did I mention she is gorgeous throughout, not that it's important. She is though.And the final scene is brilliant. I want another one and I want it now.",9,2,3,19 July 2009
Blade Runner," An Interesting Film.
","Whether you think of it as a cult oddity or one of the best examples of the science fiction genre there is no denying that Blade Runner is an interesting experience. I happen to think the film is brilliant, a unique insight into the future and the repercussions of what happens when we has human beings meddle with technology in the future. The film is more understated than what I thought it was going to be. Starring Harrison Ford and directed by Ridley Scott I was expecting an action packed extravaganza, but instead what we get is an old fashion science fiction detective thriller, the familiar tale of the bounty hunter looking for the bad guys. Of course like all great science fiction, what is on the outside is different to what's on the inside. In reality Blade Runner is a twisted fable, a look at what it means to be a human being, and what it means to lose that humanity when technology starts to appreciate it for itself. This leads to some of the most fantastically acted scenes in a science fiction film. He may hate the film but there is no denying that this is Harrison's best performance, the Blade Runner of the title, a man who we are led to believe may have more in common with  his prey than we realize. Further adding kudos to the film is Rutger Hauer, quite possibly the finest performance in science fiction history. Whether or not his character of Roy Batty is the actual of the hero of the film is for fans to argue about (I know I have my feelings on the subject), but I dare you not to be moved by his final words as he excepts his fare after saving Dekkard.Ridley Scott shows us the versatile talent that he really is with this superb film. The direction is complimented by his unique visual style. This is one of the most visually stunning films ever made. The establishing shot is the awe-inspiring of its kind, while his portrayal of a futuristic dystopia is one of the most convincing, not to mention the most frightening, ever put to film. Presented in two versions, the director's cut is the better of the two, the voice over deleted thus not spoon feeding the narrative to the audience. The more ambiguous ending is better too, thus the cop out option of Rachael and Dekkard living happily ever after can be erased (it always put me in the mood for Kubrick's The Shining). Thus the ending leaves us with more questions than answers. That is unsettling, but it is apt for an unsettling film.",10,0,1,28 October 2003
Casino Royale," Glad to have you back Mr Bond.
","After a depressingly long gap of four years which has seen countless rumour and the departure of my personal favourite Bond, Pierce Brosnan, the Eon series returns with what may be one of the finest films yet in the Bond cannon. Of course what makes this such a fantastic film is not just the usual refinements (to quote, although in this case absent, Q) such as action and spectacle, but is the risk that the filmmakers take with this, the twenty first Bond epic. The most popular leading man, at least commercially speaking, that the series has had is gone, as our some of the usual trademarks. The gunbarrell doesn't open the film outright as it does the title sequence, the latter of which does not feature naked ladies for the first time in history from what I recollect, although Daniel Kleinman, the titles designer since Goldeneye, still does a great job with the card motif, there is little in the way of hardware and gadgets and we have a blonde Bond, as many other reviewers are keen to point out.The portrayal of Bond in this film is of the utmost importance and Daniel Craig is superb throughout, mainly because the script is not a collection of action sequences with a basic story of world domination centred around it. What we have here is a three dimensional Bond, a man who hurts, feels pain, falls in love and has his heart destroyed by betrayal and death and must learn that in order to survive in this world that he has been 'promoted' to, he must trust no one. Throughout the arc that Bond goes through in Casino Royale Craig is superb. A decent actor in his own right (see Road to Perdition and Layer Cake for more), it seems that by betting an actor of this calibre, writers Purvis and Wade, along with Paul Haggis, have decided to put some meat to the bone and it works superbly. Yes he looks good in a tux, hell he looks good in an Hawaian shirt in the opening chase scene, but there is just as much substance to his portrayal of Bond and in a day and age where Jack Bauer and Jason Bourne (what is it with spies with the initials JB?) rule the roost in the genre, it's nice to see the character who started it all get something juicy to chew on.Of course a Bond film is nothing without the best action sequences to fall back on too, and Casino Royale will not disappoint anyone craving a little adrenalin whilst watching Bond. The aforementioned chase sequence at the start featuring some of the craziest running stunts in recent years will leave you breathless, an attempted terror attack at Miami airport is superbly staged whilst the the sinking house in Vienna is one of the most stunning, not to mention vicious, action sequences the series has ever done. Speaking of vicious, one should be warned that this is a more harsher film than has been done before, with the violence being more along the lines of Licence to Kill rather than Die Another Day or Goldeneye. The fights are bloody and messy and the torture sequence involving a stripped and naked Bond being beaten by Le Chiffre ranks as one of the most shocking to have been passed with a 12 certificate that I can remember.This is a great film is every aspect. As usual it is well made, with love and care from everyone, has heart as well as muscle and with the highest box office to date for a Bond film, should see the series continue for several years yet. Glad to have you back Mr Bond.",10,0,5,30 April 2007
Speed," Fast paced (see what I did there?).
","Sheer adrenalin from beginning to end, Speed is one hell of an action film, but it is one that is both simple, yet deviously complex. First of all, the plot is well done. It really is. It sound good on paper and writer Graham Yost (with a little help from Joss Whedon) takes full advantage of what might happen when stuck on a bus that has to stay above fifty miles per hour in order to stop from blowing up due to a mad bomber. Every obstacle that Keanu and Sandra could possibly face arises; children crossing the road, a woman with a baby carriage, a traffic jam, a hard right turn and of course, a big huge gap on the road. Logic is not only stretched, but it is thrown out of a very high window, but when a film is this much fun why complain.The script is very well set up, not only in terms of plot but in terms of structure. Each act has it's own set piece. Act one features the elevator sequence. Act two, the biggest act of the film takes place on the bus while the third and final act takes place on the train (a controversial contribution from Whedon and one that Yost was very unhappy with). Of course none of this would work without a great director at the helm and Jan de Bont rises to the challenge. While his career after this has been hit and miss (critics have slated his work but audiences have been forthcoming), here he shows that he has learned from being a director of photography for Paul Verhoeven and John McTiernan with a visual prowess and a handling of action sequences that is superb. In fact a lot of the film recalls Die Hard with the suspense arising from a plot that is quite simple yet deviously more complex in its execution. The biggest surprise at the time was that Keanu Reeves does wonderfully well in the role of the hero, Jack Tavern. He is charming, yet tough and while he doesn't really have to 'act' here, his performance is well done and he should be proud. Likewise Sandra Bullock in what is really her breakthrough role, even though it is her second major film after having been the female lead in Demolition Man. Her performance has all the hallmarks of her lovely girl next door act and her chemistry with Reeves works well. It is especially funny when he keeps calling her 'mam'.However the film is stolen from everyone's favorite psychopath Dennis Hopper. Brilliantly evil as Howard Payne, Hopper clearly enjoys playing a bad guy who enjoy being a terrorist ('the whim of a mad man, I like it'). While the role is not of the disturbing variety that Frank Booth is (this is a mainstream film after all), the role is great one and is instantly memorable, as is his death scene.If you have still to watch this film do. It is brilliant and is one of the best Hollywood action films of the nineties. Just don't watch the abysmal sequel.",9,20,27,27 January 2004
X2: X-Men United," Fantastic sequel that betters the original.
","The first X Men was a perfect comic book adaptation. It was flawless, keeping the action until the final act and instead focusing on plot and character development. It worked a charm and its success meant that a sequel was a foregone conclusion. Some sequels to comic book films are usually better (Superman II) or almost on a par with the first film (Batman Returns). X2 should be added to that list. In fact, it is more of a Superman II. Bryan Singer has bettered the original, and boy has he done a great job. First of all there is an increase in action, resulting in some of the most spectacular scenes outside of the Matrix series for 2003. The attack on the President at the start is spectacular with some superb visual effects, fantastic camera work, superb stunts and superb music. This launches the plot superbly and introduces us to Stryker, played fantastically by one my favorite actors, Bryan Cox. Never over the top and playing it with a realistic, yet disturbing fashion, he is a great villain and plays a magnificent part in the ensemble. Bringing back everyone that survived at the end of the first film, increasing the roles for some of the characters only seen briefly in the first film (like Iceman) and introducing some enthralling new characters like Nightcrawler, what we get is a Hollywood action packed blockbuster with heart and soul. Nearly every character gets their moment (even neglected Cyclops) and Singer shows us that not only can he do an intelligent and cerebral superhero movie, he can also do one with the best action sequences money can buy. The fight scene between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike is superb, not to mention graphically violent for a film rated 12 in the UK, the dream plot that Professor X is caught up in fantastically done and never confusing, while Jean's sacrifice is brilliantly handled and ensures that an emotional element is here that fits the film like a glove.
Performances are once again superb. McKellen and Stewart chew scenery fantastically, Hugh Jackman is fantastic once again, Famke Janssen almost steals the film with a performance that is moving, especially in the final moments, as Jean comes to terms with her increasingly stronger powers. Halle Berry gets more to do this time, mostly sharing scenes with Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler, the two sharing fantastic chemistry. Cumming almost steals the film with a performance that is at one moment funny, the next incredibly moving. X2 goes beyond a comic book movie. It is without doubt one of the best blockbusters of the year. The template that Singer was working too was The Empire Strike Back, and like the best Star Wars film, we have a sequel that is better than the original that was a great film anyway. What we have here is a more confident production. Singer seems more confident at handling the increased input of action as well as the smaller character moments (Scott and Logan's sadness at losing Jean, and the moment of her decision to sacrifice herself to save her friends is almost as memorable as the action sequences). It is very rare that we get a Hollywood blockbuster like this. When was the last time you can say you watched big bangs and fights galore and still found the film moving. This is shaping up into a wonderful series of films. I only hope that X3 is more of the same and less Superman III.",10,0,0,17 November 2003
The Sixth Sense," Creepy, but also deeply moving.
","It's not very often that a tale of the supernatural is also a deeply moving emotional experience. Usually if a tale of clairvoyance, or any narrative delving into the supernatural is going to be dealt with in a way that is emotionally very moving it is going to be done on a television series, like The X Files or Buffy. Here M Night Shyamalan creates a tale that deeply cinematic, at times unnerving and creepy, but which is deeply sad to the extent it will leave you with a tear in your eye. He succeeds admirably.
Having Bruce Willis as a caring type in a film where he tries to protect a child has been done before in the shape of Mercury Rising. That film was not the biggest hit that Willis has had (even though it was quite an enjoyable film). Usually having Willis as a caring, fatherly type is akin to having Arnie or Sly in comedy movies. We just don't really want to see them in a film like that. Willis bucks the trend of doing something different by actually doing it well. Here is superb in a non action role, putting in his best performance since Pulp Fiction. A more restrained role without resorting to using guns or being chased or shouting dialog like 'yippe-ky-yay' is quite hard to believe, but here he pulls it of fantastically. In saying that he is supported by a fantastic supporting cast. Olivia Williams and Toni Collette are fantastic, but everyone is beaten to the acting stakes by Haley Joel Osmont. Never has a child actor put in a role of such maturity or brilliance. Even better, for a child actor, he doesn't try and milk the emotional parts by purposefully playing to the character. His performance is right on the tone of this downbeat and quiet little film. The scenes he shares with Willis are powerfully intense, but in that quiet little way. Likewise his scenes with Toni Collette, who nagged a best supporting actress nod and deservedly so. Anybody who doesn't have the hairs on the back of their neck standing up, but simultaneously moved to tears when Osmont's character Cole tells his mother played by Collete about her mother really should check their own pulse. This, along with the final scene of the film, demonstrate how emotional a horror film can be as when done correctly.Having had the plot twist spoiled for me, I can't say if was a surprise or not, as not having watched the film and not know what was coming cannot lead me to saying. Knowing doesn't detract from this wonderful little film that was quite simply one of the best of 1999. The twist, which should be a horrifying moment, starts of initially as that, but develops into one of the saddest moments I have ever seen in a film. It demonstrates brilliantly what this film stands for. A creepy little thriller with the capacity to move you to tears.",9,0,0,1 December 2003
The Matrix," Star Wars for the MTV generation.
","An awe inspiring mix of philosophical debate and spectacular action sequences (in other words that rare occasion of a Hollywood blockbuster mixing intelligence with the usual dose of thrills and spills) The Matrix is a superb film on every conceivable level, doing for my generation what Star Wars did for my mum and dad. The film is one that contains many surprises (not least a fantastic lead performance from Keanu Reeves). Somewhat unconventional for a summer blockbuster, the film goes on a more complex path to most summer releases, opting for a more difficult narrative in the early stages and then going for a story route that goes from being the stylish (the sequences in the Matrix itself) to the downright filthy (the scenes in the real world). The biggest surprise from the film that I got was that I went to see it based on it theatrical trailer which highlighted the action sequences, only to find when I got there that the film was offering up a more intelligent and thought provoking science fiction story with the action sequences being saved until the last half hour, and it is this course where the film suceeds the most. The Wachowski's develop characters that we come to care about. We come to care greatly for Neo, Morpheus (for the record my favourite character) and Trinity while developing a hatred for Agent Smith (perhaps the most interesting villian in recent years). They sucessfully integrate the audience into their universe and once we're settled in, they let rip with a final act that would make even James Cameron proud. At the time of writing The Matrix Reloaded is on the verge of release and now is the perfect time to re-examine a film that has very well changed the course of cinema, perhaps forever. The sequel, along with concluding chapter Revolutions, will have to go a long way to beat this masterpiece of the Hollywood blockbustser, a genre that many thought was dead.",10,0,1,15 May 2003
Heat," A Fantastic Film.
","Undeniably one of the best films of the 1990's, Heat is a superb crime thriller that is both thrilling and artistic. Michael Mann has made many a great film; Manhunter and The Insider, but here he has created a work of sublime art, a film that is both violent yet oddly beautiful, repressive yet oddly emotional and optimistic and of course, it features Al Pacino and Robert De Niro on screen together for the first time, however it is the story that Michael Mann is telling which is the real star. Pacino and De Niro together may have been the driving force of the publicity of the film but they only share at least ten minutes of this 160 minute film together on screen. Mann just tells his story of what is essentially a film about two men who are both parts of one coin but who undeniably exhibit two sides. It is a testament to Mann's talent as one of the best writer/directors working today that this film works so well. The story of the cop hunting the robber and their story ending with a shoot out has been done to death, but here it feels new and original and best of all it is a story that is well told.Heat is an urban epic first of all. The film is takes place in the jungle of Los Angeles and proceeds to tell the story of two men, either side of the law who, while respecting one another, will kill each other when they get the chance. Over the course of their story Mann successfully introduces us to their lives and an interesting portrayal of both McCauley (De Niro) and Hanna (Pacino) develop. Despite being the crook of the tale, McCauley is the most sympathetic of the two men. Currently in a developing relationship with a book clerk he is experiencing love and we see how much he really cares for the woman he is falling in love with, while Hanna is stuck in a loveless marriage which is so loveless he doesn't give a damn when he learns she is cheating on him, the only thing he cares about is the fact that her lover is watching his television in one of the funniest scenes of the film. The way the film cuts from McCauley to Hanna is masterful as we get a sense of the lives the lead and how different and how similar they really are. Only Pacino and De Niro could make a film like this work.In saying while Heat is about the differences and similarities between cop and robber we also get to see the differences between these two masters of the acting worlds, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Both put in fantastic performances, no doubt, but I believe that De Niro is the better of  the two actors in this film. We see how De Niro is one of a more restrained quality, an actor who says his lines with restraint and custom whereas Pacino goes into what I can only describe as Scarface mode and shouts much of his dialog in the film. Yet when the two share the screen in the now legendary coffee shop meeting we see how brilliant they two of them are. As method actors we see how they bring across their characters and we see how truly great they are, both showing the restraint and master craftsmanship of two of Hollywood's finest. Their descriptions of the recurring dreams they have being one of the finest moments of modern cinema. Never has a scene consisting of page after page of conversation in a film script transfered so brilliant to the big screen.Even the many sub plots that take place around the De Niro/Pacino dynamic (Hanna's step daughter's depression and the disintegration of fellow thief Val Kilmer's marriage to Ashley Judd) doesn't dismantle proceedings. In fact it adds to the story and the character arcs of both cop and robber and works fantastically in a film that is one of the finest I have ever seen.To sum up Heat is a superb film. It is quite simply magnificent.",10,0,0,27 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Not the greatest film in the world, but still magic.
","Let me get the most important point of my review out of the way first. I do not, like many, consider this to be the best film ever made. Further more I don't even consider it the best science fiction film ever made and I do not even consider it to be the best Star Wars film ever made (that distinction, in my opinion, belongs to The Empire Strikes Back). However, there is no denying that this is one of the most enjoyable blockbusters from Hollywood ever made. Setting in stone the foundations that blockbusters need, such as a high number of special effects, action sequences, a bunch of heroes and a good looking female lead, George Lucas has not created a work of art, but he has created one of the most perfect examples of what can be done in Hollywood. A hugely enjoyable adventure that amazes the eyes and senses. There's no point saying that the acting and script are great because they aren't. While Alec Guinness, Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones are fantastic, don't get me wrong, there isn't really anything here that could be considered award worthy, but that's not the point here. This is a film that will leave with a smile on your face for the simple reason that this is a blockbuster that is exciting, emotional and at its heart simple. The story is easy to follow, the characterization never complex and we can like all of it because it's so easy to watch.There is a lot that is right. Darth Vader's entrance almost seems to have been done with the knowledge that he would become one of modern cinemas most famous villains, the Death Star battle is superb by 1977 standards, while Carrie Fisher is undeniably one of the most beautiful females to have graced the screen (less so now, but then she was a stunner), while Harrison Ford has 'star' written all over him, it's not surprising that Indy, Jack Ryan and Blade Runner followed. George Lucas makes his film in the same way that a skilled magician does a trick, with style, ease and in a way that the audience is left awed. It is easy to why the fans have taken with it, even if it is less so why it tops films polls voted for by the public. Then there is John Williams music score which is deserving of its status while C-3PO is without doubt the best 'comical' robot to appear on film.The sense of magic about this film is undeniable. Empire may be the better film, but it is also the darkest, while the Ewoks were entertaining enough, but they still can't beat this, while the prequels, undeniably with better special effects and light sabre fights, concentrate too much on the CGI sets to have us fully engage (even if I must say, they aren't as bad as everyone makes out, if you ask me.)So there it is Star Wars. The greatest film of all time? No. The most cerebrally stimulating? No, it's not that either. Is it the most entertaining and fun film ever made? Yes it is, and for that we should always be thankful.",9,4,8,1 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Not only the best Star Wars films, but one of the best pieces of Science Fiction I have ever seen.
","This is superb. This is truly one of the best sequels I have ever seen, not only as a Star Wars film, but as one of the best sequels in the history of film making. Like the granddaddy of all sequels, The Godfather Part II, The Empire Strikes Back takes the original, develops it and continues with it but is not afraid to go into darker places. We have Hans Solo being frozen alive, Luke being told that Darth Vader is his actual father and to top it all of he has his arm chopped of by him. As kid's films go, this is brilliant and dark. If the first film was like the magician's trick, this is more like a Shakespearean play, a hint of tragedy taking hold of proceedings. The characters are taken on more darker paths throughout the narrative that leads to a frightening downbeat cliffhanger. There is a sense of maturity in the proceedings here. Maybe it comes with a different director using the special effects tools in a more mature manner of different writers, but the more superficial problems that the first film had are gone here. The acting is much, much better, Mark Hamill putting in a brilliant portrayal of a Luke that is finding his life taking a more darker turn than before. The chemistry between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford retains some of the more fun and light hearted aspects, but then this leads to a darker pay off and a scene of sheer emotional intensity it is almost blinding. To think, this was intended as a kid's film.Once again the special effects are fantastic, but the screenplay from Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett as well as the direction of Irvin Kershner make this a stand out too. John Williams' music is superb as always, but here he outdoes even himself, possibly doing his finest music for his Hollywood blockbuster market. The sweeping music during the asteroid chase and the Vader theme are undeniably classic pieces of music.
This being the second part of the trilogy there are none of the constraints of the first part. The film begins almost mid flow, with the rebels on the run (this in itself marking out the downbeat nature of the film, the rebels aren't so much as fighting as running away), there is no nagging re-introductions of characters or dialog that covers what's happened before in part one, which is most welcome. What we get is essentially the second act on a three act film, and here everything clicks into place perfectly. The first one may be the most fondly remembered, but for me, The Empire Strikes Back is the one that is the greatest.",10,0,1,1 December 2003
The Breakfast Club," Clever and engaging Brat pack comedy drama.
","I only ever discovered this movie through an episode of Dawson's Creek I have to admit. It was an episode where the main characters of that show find themselves on Saturday detention and actually make reference to the film. It was only a few years later when I had taped a documentary off BBC One about Star Wars that I actually got around to seeing the movie itself as it was on straight after, prompting me to remember as the film was about to start, 'oh yeah, that Dawson's Creek film'. Suffice to say I enjoyed the movie immensely and it was only after a recent screening on Irish television that I got around to buying it on DVD, the day after said screening. I was surprised to find the film somewhat deeper, a little more intense and surprisingly philosophical when I watched it recently, seeing that there is a lot more going on here than unresolved sexual tension issues and pot smoking going on. This is a film about the fears of young adulthood and the even bigger fears of actually growing old and how disappointing life can be. This may be a film for teenagers, but it surprising how adult it can be, and how much a twenty one year old, or even someone older, can actually get something out of this film. Forget the fun and games of Ferris Bueller, as good as it it is, this is probably John Hughes' best film, offering up something more darker, but something ultimately a little uplifting, about a bunch of characters looking into themselves at a young age and not necessarily liking what they are seeing.The performances from all the cast are first rate, with special mention to Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy. Estevez, Ringwald and Hall are fine also, but these two get the best characters to play with, as do Paul Gleason and John Kapelos as two bitter school employees also realizing how disappointing life can be (a little note, keep a look out for the middle photo during the opening shots at the start of the movie to see how clever this film actually is, not to mention subtle). Add to this one of the best theme songs written for a film, in this case Don't You Forget About Me by Simple Minds, and what we have here is a bona fide 80's teen classic and an example of how teen movies today are nowhere near as good as they were when they had the Brat Pack starring in them. Today's teen movies are full of too much bad taste humour and stars who can't act, they aren't full of the pathos and genuine humour that this, and many other films, at the time had. I don't know about anybody else, but that makes me feel quite sad.",9,0,1,10 May 2006
Gladiator," Rich and Fantastic.
","*****SPOILER ALERT*****I have to say, I love this film. It is without doubt one of my top ten favorite films ever made. This is without doubt one of the most stunning Hollywood blockbuster made in the modern era, ironic considering that it is throwback to the glory days when big budget Hollywood blockbusters were all about great story and and the onslaught of an emotional context. Gladiator does everything right. The script is superb, mixing the personal story of revenge with the political angle of ancient Rome, the performances from all are fantastic and not one actor feels out of place, be it Crowe, Reed, Harris, Phoenix, Jacobi or Nielson, all have their moment and all rise to the occasion. And of course, Ridley Scott. Not giving Ridley Scott the Oscar for Best Direction was the most blatant example of day light robbery at an award session I have ever seen. As a director who has been accused of putting style over substance, here he gets the balance right. He awes us with a fantastic overhead shot of the Coliseum, and then moves us during the final moments when Maximus enters heaven and returns to his wife and child. (Special kudos must also go to Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard for their fantastic music, haunting and beautifully emotional, it is one of the best music scores that has ever accompanied a film).
The real star here is Russell Crowe. He may be a hell raiser and famous for getting into fights, but he shows us what a versatile talent he is here with a performance that is one of modern Hollywood's true greats. How can one not fail to be moved at Maximus' discovery of his dead family. The scene is superb, with Crowe giving the scene his all, while his chemistry with Oliver Reed is second to none. Having these two trouble makers on screen is superb, and Reed, had he not have sadly died during production, would undoubtedly have seen a renaissance after this film, and possibly an Oscar. The delivery of his speeches to his gladiators are without doubt some of the stand out moments of the film.
Overall this is a superb film, one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in a very long time. Undeniably this is a classic in the making.Gladiator, I salute you.",10,1,2,21 October 2003
Jurassic Park," The way all blockbusters should be...
","This is a film that has truly stood the test of time and has remained a modern classic of the Hollywood blockbuster system. Deservedly becoming the biggest film of all time in 1993 and launching the most entertaining film series ever made, Spielberg's film contains all the cliches a blockbuster should have and ensures that it remains good fun. We have the courageous scientist in the shape of Sam Niell, his fiesty girlfriend courtesy of Laura Dern, a doom and gloom expert in the causes of the problem at hand thanks to a brilliant performance from Bob Peck and the quirky scientist type who prophesises doom from the get go in the shape of Jeff Goldblum. This is fun and has remained so for the last ten years.Where the film has remained so good over the past decade is in its use of CGI and at the time state of the art special effects. They still haven't dated and look fluidly real as if the technology had only been made yesterday. Undoubtedly the dinosaurs are the star here (none of the actors have headlined each film with a change of performer for each one, Goldblum in the second installment, Niell returning for number three), but it doesn't matter because the dinosaurs here are truly movie stars in their own right and like characters in an ensemble film they all get their moments. The T-Rex gets to cause spectacular destruction, the Raptors get to be the vicious and conniving villains of the story, the Brachiosaurus ensures it grabs our awe while the Tricerotops gains our sympathy.However, Spielberg ensures that it isn't just the dinosaurs who are the stars here. He creates tension in the way that only he can with prolonged set pieces such as the T-Rex attack and the moment Alan and Tim have to race down a tree with the threat of a car falling on top of them. Sure it ain't art, it's great entertainment and it is great fun and it here where Spielberg ensures the film classic status. He uses the two hour frame to set up events and the story in the first hour and then let the chaos rip in the second with suspenseful action sequence after suspenseful action sequence and it works. While you may not look to performances in a film like this, it does have some fantastic actors. Niell seems surprisingly well suited to being a Spielbergian hero who starts of disliking children only to have his heart melted at the end. He appears to be having great fun playing the guy who saves the day. Jeff Goldblum almost runs away with the entire film as Malcolm, the quirky off beat nature of the character ensuring many a great one liner while Richard Attenborough is heart breaking as the Walt Disney like John Hammond whose dream becomes a violent nightmare.The film is great fun from beginning to end and deserves to be up there with Jaws and King Kong as one of the all time great monster movies.",10,10,13,11 June 2003
The Godfather," A work of art.
","Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's  but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best.  Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.",10,11,21,28 October 2003
