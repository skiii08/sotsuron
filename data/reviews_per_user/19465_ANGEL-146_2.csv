The Blair Witch Project," A must see for movie fans.
",Once a while you see a film that seems to be perfect.  This is one of those films.  Excitingly amazing in it's approach.  I didn't believe the movie was going to be as good as the previews.  Guess What?  It is TEN THOUSAND times better.,8,1,2,9 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I HAD a bad feeling about this one.
","If you have only seen this movie once, you have to see it again.  I personally have seen it six times in the span of four days.  When I watched it for the first time, I'll admit I was very unpleased.  But seeing it showing after showing, it only gets better.  If you've only seen it once and didn't enjoy it as much as you thought you would, go see it again.  Do it for yourself, and remember, 'The force will be with you . . . always.'",10,0,0,23 May 1999
