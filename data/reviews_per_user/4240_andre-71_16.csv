Vertigo," almost perfect thriller
","The thriller is almost perfect. I gave only 9/10, because I saw some dissatisfying cuts in the plot. For instance, the beginning: How did Scotty get up the roof again without help? There could be an easy explanation, but the audience is left without any. And the end left a whole strand open. I coincidentally found what I was missing on a friend's DVD labeled as 'alternative ending'. See it and make up your mind. The original left one main character totally meaningless. Those might be dramaturgic elements, but I did not like them.",9,1,3,12 December 2001
X-Men," it's better to have read the comics in advance
","Mostly, I agree with the others: it's not a bad movie, but it's also not a great one. At least for people like me who had not known about the comics before, because I felt as if I didn't know something throughout the film. The characters were introduced rather fast, and some strands definitely have the purpose of justifying a sequel. Thus, the movie itself seems somehow incomplete to me. It's probably more fun watching it when you know the background stories of the plot.",7,1,2,7 December 2001
The Aviator," Europeans, beware of the good rating!
","I made the mistake to read only American reviews before seeing the movie. I would have avoided the film. European reviews draw a different picture of it. The reason is simple: The movie assumes a lot of knowledge about the subject and American zeitgeist. You need to catch some keywords and names, and you need to recognise their meaning and produce the associated American emotions. If you cannot you will see a long and confusing film. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying the movie is bad. I am just saying non-Americans have a harder time understanding and thus enjoying it. However, if you want to get a glimpse of how the entrepreneurial spirit of our brothers and sisters on the other side of the Atlantic has evolved this film might be for you.",6,1,2,7 February 2005
The Patriot," some nice pictures, but what a slimy story!
","The trouble with this movie is that it has been directed by a non-US director who exaggeratedly tries to chum up with Americans in order to make big money. Hopefully, he will not earn other credit than that. The movie lacks historical precision and puts the English in an almost Nazi-like role. Well, I know how it feels like to watch expensive movies which draw a black-and-white picture, where all your ancestors are on the black side. Still, the first one and a half hours are mostly entertaining and have some fairly enjoyable scenes, which even seem to stick to historical detail. But the end of the movie could have been placed at least half an hour earlier, for every bit of the story was very clear after the first hour of the film. I give some points for the juicy gore effects, but after all only 5/10 in total.",5,0,1,4 August 2000
The Exorcist," the director's cut is not better
","I have seen both cuts of this movie, and as most director's cuts it got longer but not better. DCs just seem to be a little more eccentric and less close to the audiences. Anyway, the movie is decent and scary. I havn't got a clear message, though. Is it really christian propaganda? Well, that didn't reach me.",7,0,2,1 August 2001
Resident Evil," surprisingly good
","The only reason for me to see this movie was the mansion used as the secret entrance to the Hive. The original location happens to be next door to my home. I wasn't really expecting anything good from a video game conversion, but it was surprisingly entertaining and frightening, definitely worth the admittance. Though, the mechanisms used to shock the audience appeared a little off-the-shelf.",7,0,0,3 April 2002
Gone with the Wind," What is so great about this movie?
","I might be too young to adequately understand this movie in its time. So, here is what I have seen: A very loong film without a compelling love story (not even a real kiss), with ill-minded protagonists hard to identify with, with strange ideas of patriotism (soil over reason?), and with sublime racist messages. Now, where was the good part? Yes: no happy ending!",5,7,21,6 January 2002
The Pianist," this film really suits the topic
","I rarely give a 10 on any movie, but this one got it from me. Unlike other recent movies set in the Nazi era this one realistically tells a story through the eyes of just one person. There were few off-explanations, and there were no sentimental hollywoodish scenes. Further, I liked the cast not only of the major but also of the minor roles. The Germans really acted German, same with the Polish Jews and non-Jews - no glossing over anything. And by not straining after effects the movie gives you a chance to actually feel the sublime (and sometimes not so sublime) fear of the protagonist. Really well done!",10,1,3,8 November 2002
The Game," very intense
","This movie is very suspenseful! At some points it reminded me of old French spy thrillers, like 'I... comme Icare (1979)'. I actually liked that I was wondering all along about what was going on! *SMALL SPOILER* But the end resolved it EXTREMELY clumsily! But writers have a poetic license... So, only 8/10.",8,0,1,5 April 2001
Pi," quite disturbing but ok
","This is the kind of a movie some people should not watch directly before they got to bed. The black and white picture and the strange soundtrack let you really experience the headaches of the main character. It sometimes reminded me of 'Eraserhead' from David Lynch, but here you get more information about what is going on. This film is not a must see, but a good option, if you want to see something not of-the-shelf.",7,0,1,27 January 2003
From Dusk Till Dawn," nice idea, but a twist into a dull direction
","*mild spoiler ahead* The thing I really liked was the complete turnaround (better: complete stop) of the story which would let every standard audience go freak out. But then, I felt it became just another Tarantino movie: gore, gore and more gore. After Salma Hayek's very brief (but inspiring) human appearance I had wished for flesh, flesh and more flesh instead.",6,0,0,11 January 2002
Taken," brilliant action movie - but not at all politically correct
","From the action point of view, there isn't much to add to other reviews: it's a brilliant movie displacing James Bond and Bourne and all the other action heroes. It's very well made.So, I will only give a comment on a few things that some of you might want to know before you watch this film: The movie is extremely violent, and the use violence is never really questioned. Instead, violence is accepted even if affecting innocents. Further, the dark picture of Europe (France in particular) is absurdly overdone. OK, it's a dramatic element needed for the plot. But you can really spoil a kid's mind with these completely awkward ideas.For adults, of course, it's a super cool movie. Enjoy!",9,2,4,19 February 2010
Enemy at the Gates," better than the German critics said, but no history lesson
","The only reason why I went to see this movie was my neighbor who had a walk-on as Russian soldier in it. But I thought, the whole movie was better than the German critics said. It was quite perfectly made. I was so entertained that I even missed the scene with my neighbor. But PLEASE, don't try to learn history through a movie like this! It is for ENTERTAINMENT! Jean-Jacques Annaud said himself, that he put the emphasis on the duel - he only exploits selected historic details to set the atmosphere for the antagonists. I see it as a kind of western movie. And have you ever learned many real historical facts from a western?",6,0,0,11 May 2001
Downfall," very involving and seemingly authentic
","First of all, I am not commenting on the morality or immorality of the depicted contents. I am commenting on the film as such. And that film was really catching. Hitler was portrayed in an extremely believable way. His private moments revealed the cracks in his confidence, yet, they stressed his stubbornness. All of the used dÃ©cor seemed original. The military language and acting -even that of the extras- was precisely investigated and seemed believable. At no point, I had the feeling 'oh, this is just dumb dramaturgy'. I could feel the imminent collapse of a once so powerful oppression system. Still, in this apocalypse, the myrmidons lost their countenance only slowly. This film has let me live through all of this. Very well made!",9,6,9,20 September 2004
Scream," obviously overrated
","It's true, this film did set a new standard: a low standard easily to be met by annoying follow-ups. Films which strongly deal with other films or mix several (film-)reality levels ('a film in a film', or worse: a drama about a film) reflect one thing: inability to pick up new ideas from the outside. It's a pity that such a worn out recipe dupes so many people.",4,2,6,6 December 2001
Vanilla Sky," why the remake?
","I thought this remake to be neither better nor worse than the original 'Abre los Ojos'. The original was already pretty much American style. So, why this one? Just for the constantly smiling Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise? I hope it was not just because Americans are that ignorant against foreign movies...",7,0,0,20 January 2003
