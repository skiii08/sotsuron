Casablanca," Picture Perfect
","What can I say that hasn't already been said.  Casablanca is the Perfect movie.  Superb script, packed with memorable dialogue and one-liners. Fantastic characters, Bogart being one of THE great cinematic heroes. Scenes of dramatic tension and heart-stopping romance.  It may be cliched and rely on narrative coincidences (guess who wrote a film studies essay on this film), but when all the elements combine, who cares?  This film is timeless, being as superb today as it will be tomorrow, and the day after that, etc.My Rating: 10/10",10,0,1,4 June 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Super
","South Park is the greatest television programme in history.  Forget The Simpsons, this is the show that dares to tackle the gritty subject matter, and the film is no different, trying to offend as many people as possible in under 90 mins.Some people find this show offensive, but they are missing the point entirely.  We laugh because it highlights the one-sided attitude of society, and how we are ready to mock anyone, but look down on anyone else who does it.There is stupid humour and the songs are just ace, the whole thing melds together into one great cartoon.So good in fact, that I wrote my A-level media studies coursework on it.Anyway, if you can't laugh at other people, what can you laugh at?  South Park is there to show us that a completely censored life would just be dull.My Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,6 June 2003
Finding Nemo," It's OK
","Being a big fan of Pixar, I was slightly disappointed by the quality of Finding Nemo.  It doesn't come near to the knowing humour of the Toy Story movies, opting rather for the more 'seen it all before' Shining jokes and others.  Those sea turtles seemed so funny in the trailer, yet in the film, they get very annoying very easily.Thats not to say there isn't anything good in this film.  The man-ray teacher was definitely my favourite character, there was just something funny about the way he sang.  The Ocean's 11 style escape plan was great, as were the seagulls, who reminded me a lot of the dodo's in Ice Age.The problem Finding Nemo suffers from is that it's just too Disneyfied, a trap A Bug's Life fell into.  So while it is better than the insect take on Pixar, it doesn't match the fun of Monster's Inc or the Toy Story masterpieces.Roll on The Incredibles.My Rating: 6 out of 10",6,1,2,8 February 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Nearly, but not quite
","If you, like me, have a problem with one on one violence, yet are quite happy to watch the wanton dismemberment of an entire squad of assassins, then Kill Bill Volume One is a film best seen as having two halves.The first half features lots of unpleasant solo inflicted violence, mostly by The Bride.  The second half is so blatantly over the top that you can suspend your disbelief and squeamishness, and just enjoy it for the masterfully crafted piece of filmmaking that it is.Uma Thurman is unfortunately not the best actress in the world.  She seems too harsh, too unlikeable to ever really fully deserve empathy.  Admittedly she may be a mindless killer, but she just looks kind of weird at times, thus the necessary special something is lacking.Tarantino is a vastly over-hyped director, but credit where it's due, by completely ignoring the linear storyline and bringing in the surprising cartoon sequence, he shows himself to be a filmmaker of intense vision and bravado.It is the House of Blue Leaves that this entire film revolves around, a wonderful demonstration of the ability to use types of shot, shading and above all, kick-ass fighting.  One of the most impressive shots, completed without an edit, is the roving camera that drifts throughout the club and into the toilets.  Not even an action piece, it shows just how innovative a director Tarantino can be.  Even better that he follows it up with all the black and white, and shadowplay that follows.Unfortunately, without the House of Blue Leaves, Kill Bill Volume One wouldn't really be that special, just another film about killers.  Let's be thankful that it is there and just enjoy it.My Rating: 8 out of 10",8,0,2,29 April 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," What??????????
","So, there was this monolith and a spaceship and a talking computer and some apes and ... er ... actually I have no idea.It would probably be better if I had read the book, but I didn't understand what the hell this film was about, and it bored me senseless.  Sorry Stanley.  Even more sorry Arthur.That said, it did have Leonard Rossiter in it and South Park later did an amusing parody of Hal, so it can't be all that bad. Can it?Well yes.  But then I've probably missed the point entirely.  If there was one.My Rating: 3 out of 10",3,11,22,18 April 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Still Sucks
","I wasn't a fan of the first Matrix film, so it was pretty inevitable I wouldn't like this one, but I do have legitimate reasons.1. None of the cast can act - Keanu is still one of the worst actors in history, Fishburne is still unconvincing as an inspirational hero, Moss is still capable of looking puzzled and Weaving can only grimace lots.2. The Wachowskis cannot write dialogue.  Keanu sitting on a bench confusing the hell out of us, a French bloke in a restaurant confusing the hell out of us, and pretty ropey stuff connecting it all.3. It's too dark.  On does not look cool in a full length black jacket, that is too tight around the neck.  Too many people wear black, and the whole thing looks rather dingy.4. Nobody can properly do a decent CGI human being.  The computer generated Keanu looks more like Bruce Campbell, which would actually be an improvement.Yes there are good special effects, but a series of nice looking scenes alone does not make a good film.My Rating: 4/10",4,0,0,6 June 2003
The Matrix," ZZZZZZZ
","I have never fallen asleep at the cinema, but The Matrix is the closest I've ever come to doing so.  Quite frankly, the first hour of this film is the most boring hour of film ever.Keanu Reeves cannot act, neither can Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss doesn't do much better.  The whole thing is too dark, and let's be honest: If you've seen the trailer, you don't need to see the film, as it shows you all the special effects there anyway.I've been more disappointed by other films, but I fail to see how this uninspiring and badly acted mess is hailed so much by fans.  Any old fool can string together a series of special effects, the trick is to link them with a good story and enjoyable characters.  The Matrix does neither.
I'll admit it picks up a bit in the second half, but I was so completely and utterly appalled by the first hour, no amount of bullet time, however impressive, can save this film.My Rating: 4/10",4,5,11,4 June 2003
