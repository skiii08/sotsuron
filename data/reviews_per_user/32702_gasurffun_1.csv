The Benchwarmers," totally funny
","I thought it was hilarious. If your going for a deep plot- DON'T!!Just go and have a laugh!!! The cast was perfectly put together. It is another great movie done by Dennis Dugan. I would have liked to have seen a cameo by Adam Sandler. I actually spit my drink on my wife one time I laughed so hard. I think the main trio should do some more movies together. There was a chemistry between them that is hard to find(Three Stooges). I'm not saying they could be as good as them but it's hard to find that kind of chemistry between three relatively famous actors. So, in closing if your feeling down and need a good laugh to forget your problems, this movie is perfect for that.",9,9,18,7 April 2006
