The New World," Malick found his Pocahantas
","This is a hauntingly beautiful movie. but not one for those who prefer mindless action or cannot wait for a story to unfold. Malick uses natural and human landscape to tell a story like no one else.He could not have found a better Pocahantas than Miss Kilcher if he had gone back in a time machine and captured the original. She has a natural talent for expressing powerful emotions without a lot of elocution. Her interactions with Farrell and Rolfe are as powerful as they are economical. I don't' think she speaks a thousand words in the entire movie, but she tells her story brilliantly.A one-of-a-kind movie.",10,19,39,14 January 2006
