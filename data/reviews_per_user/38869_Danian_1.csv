Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas has two more films to clean this debacle up...
","This is a mixture between Power Rangers, A Bug's Life, the Little Mermaid and StarShip Troopers.  It just happens to have some Star Wars overtones. If it did not have a Star Wars billing, this thing wouldn't crack the 50mil mark.  Disappointed is an understatement.  Why the necessity for an entire clan of computer generated underwater yahoos and their pathetic sub-plot? Is merchandising that important.  Lucas has two more films to clean this debacle up...God speed.",5,0,1,19 May 1999
