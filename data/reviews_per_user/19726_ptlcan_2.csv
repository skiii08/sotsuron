Requiem for a Dream," Powerful and Depressing.....
",I disagree with some of the commentary calling this a sophisticated version of Reefer Madness. This movie is as much about the anguish of being lonely and lost as it is a 'drug movie.' Let's face it if you make a movie that shows how much fun it is to get heavily involved in drugs then you are blasted for promoting hedonism and it you make one that shows some of the unpleasant aspects of drugs you get accused of being a tool of government/social propagandists. Why didn't Ellen Burstyn win an Oscar for this? Her painful slide into addiction and madness really made me cringe. I like any relatively accessible American movie that doesn't try to wrap it all up in a bow at the end and 'make things right' so to speak. I liked some of the camera techniques and while the topic might put some folks off it is basically a well made mainstream movie as opposed to anything you could call arthouse or experimental. I guess I wouldn't reccommend it to anybody who prefers the sweeter side of the cereal.,Null,0,1,14 March 2004
28 Days Later...," Omega Man meets Dawn of The Dead
","I had to drag my husband to see this pionting out that it just had to be better than any of the other crap currently play and he walked out saying 'Why doesn't somebody just re-make Omega Man?' I am torn on that subject since I hold great reverence for Chuck Heston's 70's stuff, including disaster movies. I am glad a Brit made this instead of an American since it had that hopeless look and fairly ordinary hero types. Brendan Gleeson is a great character actor vastly underused. I like the premise of the 'rage' virus because it isn't too far of a stretch to imagine in American society. It isn't Dawn or Omega man but still a good genre movie that is also curiously apolitical ( except for the swipe at activist types) with enough tension to keep me interested but not so much over the top gore that gets boring. I won't give away the ending but nothing is clearly resolved. It irritates me that it is being pushed as a straight horror movie here in the states and I admire the director for at least trying to say something about the nature of what makes us human.",Null,0,0,28 June 2003
