Blade Runner 2049," Great cinematography
","Nothing exceptional narratively, but visually it's fantastic. It's immersive and it makes a really really good sequel. I liked it.",8,0,11,1 July 2019
10 Cloverfield Lane," the ending was a bad move
","Actually a really good movie - a solid 8-8.5. The movie though ruined it, so the rating I'm giving it for that is actually a 7. The only reason I'm leaving it at eight is for personal reference - I might come back to it and want to remember 90% o the film being better than a 7.",8,0,0,16 November 2019
Psycho," spell-binding.
","I know exactly how to go about this, I daresay. I'm gonna begin by clearing the air as regards one defining aspect of the movie, namely that it is black and white. Now, you can rest assured- the quality is impeccable, as there are lots of movies of lower quality out there; the cast, in addition,is top-notch.And I mean it. AAAnd the black-and- white thing , if anything, is a huge PERK. You heard me! it is an advantage, amounting, all in all, to the uncertain and suspenseful vibe that the movie conveys.Anyhow, I'm gonna be short and sweet as this is not a book review and nobody (at least I know for a thing that I detest them) really goes in for lengthy comments.The bottom line is that this tour-de-force is a must. A M U S T. and it isn't so because your teacher says so , or some haughty maven crows about it. It is because a friend says so- with a mere interest that people should watch art and good movies instead of preposterous time-wasters. This movie is the best psychological thriller I've ever seen( and certainly the great masterpiece people make it out to be). And there are a great deal of them. I'm not gonna ramble on about this, as there are a couple of movies that come close , but after pondering my choice well enough, I can assert that this is the best all-around, a cut above the competitors, and puts some of the nowadays tentative horror-things to shame, as the principles are timeless.Pick it, no second thoughts about it. I'm gonna say just this- this is even better than Fight Club, as it is better proportioned in terms of length-content , and needless to say other praiseworthy works such as American Psycho.",10,0,2,23 September 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," 10 for visuals. 3 for everything else
","The movie looks amazing. You can call it eye candy, but the visuals are freaking great. A shame though that once you strip that away, the story itself isn't much to talk about. It's pedestrian. It's unexceptional. It's actually even worse than that- barring the visuals, it's an out-and-out average film with propagandistic feminist undertones. Too bad - it could've been a great film.",7,1,3,21 August 2019
