It Chapter Two," Average, but far from scary.
","A very average movie! Maybe it's because I'm a big horror movie fan! But it's not scary at all & honestly seemed more like a comedy. Like I really don't know how you'd ever find this any sort of scary, unless your scared by Pan's Labyrinth type creatures! In addition it also seemed kinda corny... they killed Pennywise by dissing him to death. Oh and people giving it a 10/10 keep in mind a 10/10 is a masterpiece not this.",5,2,4,6 September 2019
