Scarface," Tony Montana! The World is Yours!
","Okay, so this movie is a classic and I don't think anyone will argue with me. Scarface, directed by Brian de Palma, is still considered by many to be the best Gangster/Drug film ever made. It is also probably Al Pacino's most famous role, and of course, it has one of the most famous film quotes ever: 'Say Hello to my Little Friend!'I don't know if you need me to explain what this movie is about, but just in case you haven't seen it, it is about a Cuban immigrant who arrives in Miami with big dreams. He starts at the bottom and works him up to be one of the most notorious Drug Dealers in Miami. Then it all goes into a downward spiral as he succumbs to greed which ultimately leads to his downfall.As mentioned above, and probably known by most, Al Pacino plays Tony Montana (Scarface). What can I say about the acting? Al Pacino is brilliant! One of the best (if not THE best) performances in film history. This movie made him what he is today.The movie also stars Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays Tony's Drug Addict wife. I am not a big fan of her, but she is okay, I guess. The rest of the cast is also okay, but your attention is mainly focused on the awesome performance by Mr. Pacino.Furthermore, the movie is also just plain genius. The screenplay is brilliantly written, by Oliver Stone actually and the directing couldn't be better, especially for a film made in the 80s. The music sucks ass, but it actually kinda fits in with the 80s, so at the same time it doesn't suck ass. Ha!In Conclusion: This movie is as violent as it is Awesome, super bloody and the body count almost as high as the number of 'f**ks' in the film, which I think is used at least 200 times. Glad Brian de Palma directed instead of A-hole Oliver Stone. I give at least 9 out of 10! This movie truly is a Cult Classic that will always be one of my favourites.",9,1,3,21 January 2012
L.A. Confidential," One of the Best Crime Films of the 90's. A classic Action Drama!
","I have watched this movie several times before today, and every time I watch it I just realize again how great this film is. This is actually a pretty famous movie, but somehow people don't really take notice of it. It's one of those movies you watched with your father years ago on VHS. You remember it being a good movie, but forgot how great it actually is until you watch it again years later. I really recommend this movie! Especially if you like movies about Organized Crime, Police Corruption & the Good Cop Bad Cop routine.LA Confidential is about three detectives of the corrupt LAPD (Big Surprise). Set in the 50s, they all use their own unique methods to uncover a conspiracy of a massacre that took place in an all night diner. What follows is a story with several twists and turns to expose who is behind this mysterious crime.The Cast also has a cool as hell, with Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe & Kevin Spacey playing the main detectives. Probably the coolest role Russell Crowe has ever played – A tough LA Cop who doesn't f**k around and beats the s**t out of anyone not playing by his rules.Kevin Spacey is awesome as always and even Guy Pearce (Momento, Ravenous) showed his acting skills & talents. He plays the good honest cop that wants justice and will always follow the correct procedures to get this. He and Russell then make the perfect Good Cop-Bad Cop team! The only lame part of this movie is Kim Basinger. I don't like her! She can't act and has an irritating face.But apart from this, it's a Classic Film. May be a tad long for some people (over 2 hours), but if you haven't seen this, it's a great film to watch of you are in the mood for a Crime Classic.I give it a 8.5 of out 10 just because the film's elements mix together so well.",8,2,4,21 January 2012
Shutter Island," Not what you expect from a Scorsese film, but one of his best!
","A Scorsese Film – What more can you say?? I am starting to think that this guy can't make a bad film. Shutter Island is somewhat different of you might expect from Scorsese, which we all know, is famous for his Crime / Gangster related films (also probably Biopics) such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York and The Departed. He is probably Master of this Genre, and then he pops up with the movie Shutter Island, a Psychological Thriller / Mystery Movie.Shutter Island is about a US Marshall and his partner investigating the mysterious disappearance of a patient who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane. When he arrives at the island all sort of strange things begin to happen and he later doubts his sanity while some horrible secrets of the island are revealed.The two US Marshalls are played by Leonardo DiCaprio & Mark Ruffalo, both brilliant actors and living up to the reputation of being in a Scorsese film, not that it is anything new for Leonardo. Other cast joining them is Ben Kinsley (Creepy), Michelle Williams (Ghosty), Emily Mortimer (Mental) and Jackie Earle Haley (Crazy).The visual effects are superb, the cinematography is great, the story is well written, and to be honest there isn't much wrong with this movie. The sound and the music fits in awesomely with the creepy setting and sometimes actually makes you feel uncomfortable as if you were a prisoner / patient there yourself.Shutter Island is freaking awesome! I give it 9 out of 10. Almost everything of this movie is great. I Love Scorsese, I love mostly all his movies, and certainly love Shutter Island.",9,1,3,21 January 2012
Inception," A Nearly Perfect Movie – 10/10
","Okay, first of all, I had really high expectations for this film, I mean really high! And I didn't think that I was going to say this, but Inception actually exceeded my (super high) expectation. Christopher Nolan, now definitely one of my favorite directors, really did make a nearly perfect movie here.Even though I have watched most of Nolan's films (Momento, Insomnia & Batman Begins), I only really started to notice his talent in The Prestige, which is also probably in my Top 10 movies of all time. Then of course, came The Dark Knight, which blew my mind and is my favorite movie of 2008.But anyway, without talking too much s**t, my point is, is that he set the bar pretty high for himself.Enter Inception A film about dreams! It is set in the near future where technology allows for people to invade another human's mind through his dreams. Now, Enter Leonardo DiCaprio, the best mind invader there is, has to get a team together to do his toughest job ever, inception, in other words, plant an idea inside a person's mind through his dreams. Blah blah blah, go watch the movie.Even though the complexity of the story and the nearly two and a half hours of runtime, you don't need to worry about ever being bored or too confused. It keeps you intrigued the whole time, and although there might be some confusing parts, you never get to the point where you are completely lost in the complex storyline.Apart from the highly intelligent story, there isn't much that is wrong with this movie. The cinematography, special effects and CGI is out of this world (literally) and it is like nothing you have ever seen before. The sound effects & musical score also fits in perfectly.Inception also has a great cast. Leonardo is the s**t, Ellen Page (Juno, Hard Candy, Xmen 3) & Marion Cotillard (Big Fish, and bunch of French movies) are pretty hot and I am even starting to like Joseph Gordon- Levitt (Brick, 500 days of Summer and the awful 10 Things I hate about you). Also making an appearance is Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy, who both also star in other of Nolan's films.So, as you can see, I really really loved this film. Definitely my favorite movie of 2010 so far, probably the decade with Inglourious Basterds, being the competition.This really is nearly PERFECT Movie! I give it 10 out of 10 because somehow 9 out of 10 doesn't seem high enough.",10,0,5,21 January 2012
