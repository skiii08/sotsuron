The Blair Witch Project," What they don't show you is more terrifying than what they do.
","This movie was intensely terriying, not because of what you saw, but because of what you didn't see, and were left to create in your mind.  It took a little while to get used to the 16mm camera, and documentary style, but it added to the terror with its natural sound and reality.  Such a simple idea as this must leave big-horror-movie buffs and agencies kicking themselves, because it shows that audiences are truly terrified not by serial killers wielding chainsaws coming through the wall, but by symbols and slight crackling noises that leave chills for days and weeks to come.  Anyone up for a camping trip now???",9,1,1,2 August 1999
