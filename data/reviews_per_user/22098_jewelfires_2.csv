It," Stephen King is mentally ill
","It is so clear that Stephen King is mentally disturbed. All you have to do is read any of his books or watch his movies to know this. Actually, you can just about tell by looking at him. His story lines are twisted, warped and basically just evil. It is a shame he has become so rich from the garbage he spews.",1,1,5,30 October 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Two hours of garbage.
","SPOILER: Thought this film might be worth watching, because Keaton was in it and I liked him in a couple of his old movies. I was wrong. What a waste of time. And, no the satirical nature of the film was not lost on me. It just sucked. It was way too dark and heavy (much like him as Batman.) Keaton just came off as a psychotic, schizophrenic, suicidal actor. It was painful to watch, since it was obvious before the end he planned on killing or hurting himself. All it did was make New York theater seem filled with cold, empty, power hungry and confused people. It sucked ~ don't waste your time!!",1,0,2,1 March 2018
