Vertigo," Somewhat disappointing
","Contains spoilers:Having recently seen and enjoyed Psycho for the first time, I had high hopes for this one.  While beautifully shot and generally entertaining, there were a number of plot points that were simply too far-fetched.  First, the ridiculous scheme to cover up the wife's murder.  Surely there was a much more convenient way to discreetly knock her off (cut brake line?) than a weaving a silly ghost story.  Next, Scottie falls in love and starts putting the moves on his friend's wife within a couple days of meeting her.  That hardly seems very Jimmy Stewart-esque.  Finally, the incomprehensible ending.  Why does Judy jump?  There is no evidence given that she's suicidal, although she can't be happy with the turn her relationship has just taken.  The sight of a nun approaching can hardly be spooky enough for her to desire to plunge to her death.  And Scottie doesn't even seem terribly shaken up about the whole business this time around.  Overall good, but strangely unsatisfying.7/10, because it is Hitchcock after all and Stewart is always great.",7,3,7,10 March 2002
