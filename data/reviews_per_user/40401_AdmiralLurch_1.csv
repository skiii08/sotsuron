Casablanca," Foundation of CInema
","I normally do not enjoy romances, however, there are a few exceptions, and Casablanca is a major one. This film has to be the best romance that I have ever seen, and even when not looking at the romantic elements it still is a fantastically written and performed film. Humphrey Bogart is still one of the best actors to ever grace American film, and from my experience rarely had a performance that was less than stellar. The dialogue is expertly written, and the camera work and lighting make the viewer feel like that they are almost there with the actors, feeling what they feel. This movie is essential to see for anyone claiming to enjoy movies, and is the quintessential romance and drama.",9,1,2,14 March 2013
