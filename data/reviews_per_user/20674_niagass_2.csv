Black Swan," A Masterpiece
","The obvious themes that Aronofsky's Oscar nominated 'The Wrestler' has in common with 'Black Swan' are self-destructive, narcissistic athletes as its lead characters. This is reflected through multiple hand-held, unfiltered camera shots; but the similarities don't end there. The two stories paralleled themes flow through this story effortlessly. The only difference I noted is whereas 'The Wrestler' has a genuine smaller indie flick feel, 'Black Swan' presents in the manner of magnificent old style movie thriller. From the very first scene there is a distinct sense of menace circling the story from the very start that grabs and pulls you in. As you are experiencing the innocence pouring out of Nina (Natalie Portman), dressed in pristine white shrugs and scarves and baby pink coat, you feel there's something else in store. You are afraid of seeing something extremely disturbing.The film explores multiple themes. One theme shows that perfection is an impossible and in some cases a destructive state of being, where we can be our own worst enemy. The opposite sides of black and white in terms of Nina being very controlled and impulsive verses the character she is charged to embodies her role as the Swan Queen.This is the story of the Swan Queen from Swan Lake come to life in film.Natalie Portman plays the narcissistic ballerina to perfection. It's a very demanding role where she appears in every single scene! She was more than believable as a dancer. There is a point with a character such as this where you know it will all come together and this point was when she became the 'Black Queen'. She nailed it and I know because 'Swan Lake' is my favorite ballet. I have seen this ballet too many times to count. I knew what to look for and I found itÂ… Although Natalie is not a professional dancer, her portrayal of one was quite impressive",10,9,19,19 October 2010

","I found the movie to be very entertaining and left wanting more. The adaptation from book to film was spot on. Of course there were parts in the book I would have loved to have seen make the film version,but in reality my minds eye version would have been something unwatchable. Dakota and Jamie's performances were brave and I never saw them acting not once. The theater was filled with people all ages ranges and diverse ethnic backgrounds couples groups singles. I was not surprised. The books did not sell so many copies for no reason. People loved this story. The scenes were tasteful and overall I felt the actors embodied the roles of Ana and Christian. I read all three books and know the story well.",10,12,28,17 February 2015
