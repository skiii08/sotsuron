The Blair Witch Project," Worst movie I've seen in a long time!
","'Is that it?' That was my reaction when this movie was over. I couldn't believe it had been hyped so much and offered so little.One good measure of how good a movie is is how well it pulls you into it. If you lose track of your surroundings and feel like you're a part of the movie, it's probably a pretty good flick. Based on that criterion, this one sucked.The gimicky hand-held camera shots were nauseating and distracting. Had there been a decent plot and dialog I would have overlooked the seasickness this movie almost induced.But nothing about it was good. Almost every horror movie I've seen does a better job of bringing you into the movie than this one does. It was really bad. The whole movie I kept waiting for the build-up to end and for the real action to begin. I really wanted to be 'in' this movie. But it never succeeded.I suspect viewers under 21 probably enjoy this movie a lot more than older viewers. Unless you really related to the characters...which I didn't...I think it would be hard to feel like you're out in the woods with these actors. On several occasions I checked my watch to see when the movie would be over. That's a REAL bad sign.Did I say that I didn't like this movie?I'm particularly annoyed because I WANTED to like it. I'm also annoyed because I could have seen Sixth Sense or any number of other movies, but we chose this one. We don't go to the theater all that often; mostly rent videos. To think we paid $14 to see this when we could have seen something decent gets my goat. Movies should offer a money-back guarantee. Oh well. I got sucked in by the hype. That's show biz.P.S. Save your money. It's not a good movie!",1,1,3,14 August 1999
