First Man," We've all seen it before
","If this was the very first biopic of an astronaut maybe the eccentricities this displays might be exciting or unusual, but there have been so many before that this story line leaves little to get excited about.The plot drags badly, the character of the small community of astronaut and their families are all so cliche, I'm not claiming it is untrue, just cliche. They desperately need some new angle, some reason to watch this story line.Add to it all I lived through that entire period of time, I was excited when it actually happened but I have no more excitement saved up to go through it all over again.Nothing remarkable or bad about the acting or the production values but I want to see something special and this just was not it. I gave it a 5 out of charity for loyalty to the American space program in which I worked as s technician.",5,1,1,18 August 2019
Bridge of Spies," Look for Oscars
","I feel sandbagged after watching this movie I went and looked up the main character since it was based upon a true story. We first meet Jim Dononvan working an insurance case, but I would have to ask why in the world is this man arguing an insurance case? Certainly I would also question why this man was chosen for the main action of the plot. There is where an opening up of his background would explain it all simply but we don't get it except a single throw away line.Donovan worked on the Nuremberg trials as a prosecutor, he also was general counsel to the OSS, the predecessor to the CIA. He had extensive experience with handling secrets and dealing with spies and likely knew more than a smattering of German. Not the plain Jane insurance lawyer the movie offers for him. Choosing him for the action in this plot now seems perfectly natural.However not knowing all of that information means we see the action in quite a different light. So which individual do we cheer for? The plain Jane insurance lawyer or the high powered spy master and Nuremberg prosecutor? Should I blame myself for not knowing ahead of time? Anyone who reads this prior to watching the movie will not see the same movie I saw since I didn't have this information ahead of time. Given the people associated with this movie how can it possibly not be nominated for multiple Oscars. It is a good quality movie though and in this year of so-so movies it could easily make the grade for an Oscar.",8,1,5,17 October 2015
Apocalypse Now," Is this a war or politics
","As we learn going along that the anti-hero Kurtz knew what the Vietnamese war was really about and chose to position himself where he could force change. By the time Kurtz is given his new command he knew all about the lies and political compromise of the American generals and especially the politicians who 'ran' the war.Time after time Kurtz's successful actions embarrassed the powers that be, so eventually he just went off into his own little world and made war the best he could and he was just a little too good.So along comes Capt Willard, ready and eager to get back into the fray. But upon reading Kurtz file, he comes to admire him, to understand him. Still his own mission must be fulfilled, what to do? Notice at the end Willard taking Kurtz's notes and other papers with him as leaves. He knows just how important they are.Unlike many here who claim this movie is NOT about war, well I disagree. It is about the hypocrisy of war, and most specifically how the American politicians and generals fought that war in the public square unable or unwilling to prosecute the war as 'just war.' Sadly the US has yet to learn that lesson.",9,0,2,21 September 2015
Amadeus," The politics of Music circa 1760
","Everyone else quite rightly focuses on the music and there is no doubt it is great. Neville Mariner and his orchestra are the epitome of Mozart experts.But I would open the discussion up and ask viewers to see something else here. The politics of Music. Salieri passes through his active phase as composer and has moved into the realm of politics. There is no doubt Salieri is an expert in that field, sensitive to the political motives of his financial supporter, and able to conflate the issues of German or Italian language for the first Mozart opera in Vienna. Able to manipulate the levers of power within the court to get whatever he wants. A simple word from him can cut the run of Mozart's opera down to the bare essentials.But politics never satisfies Salieri, he has made his choice and cannot live with it any more. By the time Mozart shows up his skill as musician has faded and all he is left with are clunky, and mediocre products. But this movie simply leaves most of the music Salieri has already done in the past never to be brought up again, there must have been some significant quality that brought him up to the level of Maestro, to the respect of the power elite. You simply do not become court composer with mediocrity.The character of Mozart that Salieri hates most is his naivetÃ©, a sort of innocence. As a wielder of power there in Vienna, Salieri chooses to use it to kill off this wild child, to destroy the innocent since he is stuck living the life of cynicism and political correctness. His desire is to take credit for the final mass so as to revive his career as musician, since it will be written in his own hand writing and not Mozart's.",Null,0,1,7 August 2015
Coco," Is this a Christmas movie or what?
","Oh I forgot, the Olaf mini movie was the Christmas movie this one was completely at the wrong time of year.So I will review it as though it was at the right time of the year and just get on with it.The visuals were outstanding, easily Oscar level. (But then again that is why we are seeing it in December.) The plot was a tear jerker and very successful at it too. Follow your heart is always a good reason for tear jerking.Having grown up in the Southwest I have been familiar with the Dia del la Muertas for ages, the visuals on the masks was well known and expected. I do have an issue with this as a holiday worth celebrating, it is a pagan feast day.So I was torn between taking the movie at face value and giving it a 10 or making complaints about it being anti Christian. I took the easy path and gave it the 10. Whatever it was about it was good at.",10,4,9,5 December 2017
Contact," Revengeful engineer manipulates naive scientist
","Unlike some others here I see an incredibly rich and powerful engineer who has designed huge government projects in the past wants one last bit to screw with the entire earth rather than merely the USA.He selects his patsy early in her life and works his will to so totally to do his will without her even recognizing he is pulling all the strings. His plot is briefly ended when the government funding is removed and takes awhile before he can manage to get her back on track. But Hadden uses his powerful organization to manipulate Dr Arroway into finding his signal supposedly from the star Vega this signal just happens to be almost exactly what would be expected from some off world intelligence.When the code he makes up becomes bogged down in translation he provides the clue for its decoding and the government is off to the races. Seems it is the plans for some mysterious machine that ends up costing 1/2 Trillion dollars. But its not just that, seems that most of the money spent goes to subcontractors or wholly owned subsidiaries of Hadden enterprises. Mind you he is dying of some cancer and this is his way to get back at all human society.There is never going to be anyone but Arroway in the machine (his patsy) and when someone else is selected Hadden manages to get the first machine destroyed and Dr. Arroway goes to the systems test site in Japan with one more Hadden industry subcontractor which has another complete machine ready to go. Hadden doesn't want anyone to realize this machine is bogus yet.This movie is really about Hadden and not Dr. Arroway and written well enough that it is hard to figure it out. Some people might even reject this theory but it is plain as day if you watch carefully.",9,1,2,10 June 2016
Contact," Faith in what?
","To begin with we must acknowledge that both the writer (Carl Sagan) and the star (Jody Foster) are well known atheists. Secondly, I believe their agenda is to attempt to explore the idea of faith. Thirdly this plot and the questions it asks uses cliche image and plot points used in many other places.Palmer Joss and Dr Arraway's discussion in Washington DC is one critical plot point worth mentioning. When Arraway and Joss discuss the existence of God.
Arraway suggests that God cannot be proven and Joss comes back and demands she prove she loves her father, but never gets the chance to do it due to being taken away with some new issue. Leaving any argument she might offer unsaid.And in the end when confronting the senate investigating committee, Arraway is essentially forced to admit she only has her own private experience and nothing else as proof of her 18 hour long experience.The word 'faith' never appears in the dialogue, but it is in fact a central theme of this movie. Joss's Christian faith and Arraway's faith in science which is severely shaken by the final scene. The audience left to decide for themselves just what we should place our faith in.I highly recommend this film even for reviewing again and again it holds up under multiple viewings.",9,0,1,17 November 2018
The Martian," Is this just another argument for having humans in space?
","Yes of course it is. Frankly I do support that goal. So who is it that fights against that? The bureaucrats of course. This was filled with evil bureaucrats making obviously wrong headed decisions just so the 'space cowboys' could defy them.This movie is filled with hackneyed and cliché characters, and anyone who was not blind could see the ending long ahead of time. No, I did not even read the book.By any standard the cinematography was good, and the Martian set pieces looked too, not especially great mind you but at least good enough. Watching this film in 3D did absolutely nothing for me at all, I recommend saving the extra $3 and seeing it without the special glasses.My suggestion is to wait until this reaches the discount theaters and see it there.",4,14,46,4 October 2015
