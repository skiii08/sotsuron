The Avengers," Eye candy, and eye candy only
","The Avengers has been the trend for the past few days. Everybody had only good things to say about the movie, and so I decided to watch it. Well, it was not that good, not for me at least.The film is a visual extravaganza, competing on the number of villains and visual graphics scene by scene. If that is what you want from a movie, then don't read the rest, just go and watch the movie, you won't be disappointed.But what the movie really lacks is a good solid storyline. It is as if the director wanted the movie to feature this much of characters and they should all get the same amount of screen time, let it be at the expense of the story! That is the main issue with the movie.Upto the interval, the movie just drags on, the usual stuff with the villain trying to steal an energy source and the superhero team assembling to get it back. There is another interesting thing here. The villain actually tries to manipulate the team and let them fight each other, and this goes on and on and on in the first half. Really, absolutely boring with clich√©s all over. No creativity of any sort.In a superhero movie, one thing we expect is the introduction of the superheroes. Well, introduction???? There was no such thing, they just walked on to the scene saying, 'Hi, there'. No thrill, no excitement , no sheer blood rushing through the veins scene.And some people were there for no reason at all. I do not know what Black Widow and Captain America did. They just felt like minnows compared to the Hulk and Thor and co.The cast was good anyway. Well they are not doing their roles for the first time, are they? so no credit there to the Avengers Team. Jeremie Renner, Scarlet Johansson and Robert Downey Jr were superb.After the interval, the movie gains some pace and it is all action. This is where the movie becomes watchable. Actually I liked the second half of the movie. Action does not need story or dialogues, does it? May be that is why. And last but not the least, is that guy Loki really a villain or a joker?? Is that what a villain is? never terrifying, not even for a 2-year-old. and in the end '''Spoiler alert'''''' Hulk thrashes him and says 'puny god'. some villain, ha???!!!I am a big fan of superhero movies. In my opinion the best superhero movie released recently was X-Men First Class. Compared to that this is absolute crap, I would say. These guys made a movie which is to be their masterpiece, to which they put their money and effort limitlessly and it came out disfigured like this?, wow!!!!!",6,4,17,30 April 2012
The Notebook," Heart Warming
","I am not particularly a fan of romantic movies because most most of them give exaggerated importance to superficial pretensions. But this one, oh God, I do not know whether this should be put under romance genre. I think this should be tagged under the genre of love.I do not want to talk to you about the plot because it is nothing, it is just an age old story. But we all have lived the same boring days again and again and then suddenly there may come a day which is, what can it be called, beautiful?. That is what The Notebook is. Really, really beautiful.The script is simple but piercing. It might be more difficult to make a simple movie and The Notebook may come as an example. If you love good, heart warming stories, then this one is for you. Go,watch, cry, laugh, live!",10,1,2,19 November 2010
The Insider," A very good thriller
","The Insider is a 1999 movie directed by Micheal Mann based on a segment of CBS TV Show '60 Minutes'. The movie depicts the true events that happened in the background. It is a about an interview of a tobacco company whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand portrayed by Russell Crowe. Al Pacino stars as Lowell Bergman, the producer of the show. There is nothing flambuoyant, nothing extravagant, just true events although dramatized for the sake of a movie.The movie is a fantastic, pure thriller. It will grip you to the seats till the end. The screenplay is really brilliant but the standout factor is the acting of the two titans, Russell Crowe and Al Pacino. I was amazed by their performances.I am not going to elaborate on the storyline here. You just watch and enjoy.",9,8,9,5 February 2012
3 Idiots," A good entertainer but over-hyped as usual
","Now a days people have the tendency to overreact to some good movies. Like in the case of Dark Knight, which was a good movie but not the immortal classic. Same thing goes here, this one is a good movie, sometimes u see movies to relax yourself. This is a good entertainer.But for a movie to become a classic or the top 250 of all time as some people say, u got to have something which you won't forget for the rest of your life. But 3 idiots lacked such substance. The movie's theme is good. The educational system of India is rotten. I perfectly agree to it. Even more the perspective of the common man to their children's education is pathetic, in my eyes. The movie really conveyed that idea. But let me ask you a question. Didn't Aamir Khan act in a movie called Taare Zameen Par, which sort of conveyed the same idea. That movie was good. It had heart. 3 Idiots is old wine in new bottle. The wine still tastes good.You can buy it, no problem. But don't b fooled. Don't think its new imported wine. Its still the old one.If only the director was a little bit more realistic, I think I would have liked the movie much better. He might say that lot of people liked the movie, but its going to be short lived. He could have made the movie a classic. All was there, script and direction was good, but not up to the mark",7,5,11,27 January 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," A Fantastic film. But definitely not #1
","Shawshank Redemption is a fantastic film from the beginning right till the end. It is really beautiful. The direction and script are really superb. The acting of Morgan Freeman is exceptional. If Forrest Gump was made on another year, he would certainly have got an Oscar. If you want me to describe the movie in one word,I would say, ' Beautiful.' The story was very good, the storytelling was better. The scriptwriter deserves an applause. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It certainly deserves a spot in the top 250. But having said that, I don't think this movie should be #1. It will be like a disgrace to the movies like Schindler's list and Forrest Gump because those movies really touched my heart. I think Schindler's List and Forrest Gump should come above Shawshank Redemption.1 thing I forgot to tell you. I liked the dialogue of Morgan Freeman with the parole evaluator. It was absolutely heart touching. This movie has a hidden propaganda. Well, not particularly hidden, anyway. It is about the question of imprisoning people. Should it be done??Do we have the right to do that?? Wouldn't it be better if we try to talk some sense into them?? Or, wouldn't it even be better if we kill them rather than to give them life sentences?? I think I have an answer but that shouldn't be discussed because I think this question will continue to be a moral dilemma of the human communityI really liked that dialogue. Rehabilitated?? Let me tell you something sonny, that word is for politicians so that you can wear a suit and a tie and can have a job. Brilliant. Heart touching.This movie is an emotional dilemma folded together into an easily understandable story. There is one more thing I need to put here. Most o f the people who have rated this movie # 1 haven't got a clue about this hidden message. They have rated this because of the surprise ending. This is an open criticism.",9,1,3,5 February 2010
