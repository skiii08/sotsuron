Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049
","When I saw Blade Runner 2049, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would, i think this is because I found the general story and meaning of the film quite hard to understand and follow. The visuals and semiotics is what i enjoyed the most, I thought the cinematography used was incredible and very clever as it did help to tell the story of the film. Even though I didn't enjoy Blade Runner 2049, I did enjoy it a lot more than the original Blade Runner and can understand how it has been a larger success than the original film.",6,1,3,15 December 2017
