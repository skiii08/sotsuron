Moneyball," Moneyball, A Baseball Story That Doesn't Totally Fill the Big Screen
","It's a movie that begins and grooves (for a while) with a promising premise – that is based on a true story of a then-novel way to determine the true value of major league baseball players and how the Oakland Athletics' used that approach to fill three critical departures.Starring Brad Pitt as real-life general manager Billy Beane, the movie gets off to a intriguing start with a compelling conflict during a meeting between the team's general manager, Billy Beane – played by Brad Pitt – and a group of seasoned scouts and player development officials. The off-season focus of the pow-wow is to determine how to fill the void created by the free-agency departure of three star players – Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi and Jason Isringhausen.The solution – much to the incredulity of the old guards – begins with the stealing of a young Cleveland Indians official, a recent graduate from Yale with a degree in economics, who is a devotee of the Bill James statistical school of thought that revolutionized the value we attach to ballplayers. Portrayed with nerd-perfection by Jonah Hill, it doesn't take him long to get Beane to wed himself with a religious fervor to this novel approach.Leading to the acquisition of three castaway players who nonetheless statistically equate to comparable replacements in place of the departed top-dollar players, the approach is initially stymied by the team's manager Art Howe (played by Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hofffman) who doesn't buy into it and is determined to manage the team – such as it is – as he sees fit.While he is clearly one of the greatest actors to walk the earth, Hoffman is cast in an understated role. If before seeing this movie you make the mistake of watching a DVD of him in previous raging roles such as his turn as a beleaguered priest in Doubt, you will truly be frustrated by the emotional leash he wears throughout the film. Although the conflict between the manager and Beane leads one to believe that one of Hoffman's patented furious and always entertaining explosion performances is in the offing, it disappointingly never happens.For knowledgeable baseball fan, it doesn't take that good of a memory of this not-so-distant sports history to recall that the A's have not been in a World Series since 1990, and that makes for an inherent spoiler from the start. The otherwise success that takes place during that 2002 season offsets that somewhat, but the last 40 minutes of the movie is anti-climatic to that which came before (and really never reached a climatic point).Far from being spoken in the same breath as the greatest baseball movies of all-time, its main value is in telling the somewhat true story of the innovations pushed by Billy Beane, who is still seeking a real-life World Series appearance and championship. Brad Pitts does the best he can with the role and script he has been given, as do the rest of the actor. However, at the end of the movie, it is an interesting question that begs – without the overhead cost of the stars and production values, would the filmmakers have made a more compelling and profitable movie if they had done it as a documentary? Such a question leads to the conclusion that the talents of Pitt and especially Hoffman were largely wasted in Moneyball.While a documentary could have expanded further on some of the more illuminating revelation of the latest in statistical number crunching and thereby possibly make a thought-provoking film, pouring the 2002 Beane/A's story into plot glass leaves it less than half empty.",Null,1,2,25 September 2011
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Wolf of WS's Biggest Excess is the Film Length
","The excesses in the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, the true story of the wealthy stockbroker told in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, is an essential element of this movie. However, the biggest sin of the filmmaker is that he stretches out of the debauchery, greed and decadence over a three-hour film that is ineffectively countered with only an infinitesimal amount of moral and rational content.The acting of Leonardo DiCaprio is not in question here; nor, for that matter, are the performances of his supporting cast, most notably Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, who play his business partner and second wife, respectively. Strong performances abound by those three actors and others as well in this cinematic effort. In the case of DiCaprio, one could argue that this could be one of the top movie portrayals of his career.However, save for the very brief moralistic beginning of the Belfort character, the other 98 percent of the movie leaves you with a protagonist that offers nothing for viewers to root for, unless you are a fervent worshiper at the altars of Gordon Gekko (see Oliver's Stones' 1987 Wall Street), Hustler's Larry Flynt and the Allied Brotherhood of Drug Dealers Incorporated.Yet, this is apparently the true-life story of Belfort. Thus with respect to his rise to making millions of dollars, all the drugs, sex and abject degenerate behavior that went with it, along with his eventual fall from the illicit pinnacle he built up for himself and his company, it is what it is.However, when the audience is required to endure the long drawn out corruption and comeuppance without giving it any reason to care about the outcome of the arrogant central character, it makes for an unsatisfying cinema experience. Just a little bit of redeeming character (even if invented), such as that afforded to cocaine magnate Tony Montana (Al Pacino) in the 1983 Scarface, along with about 30-60 minutes of editing cuts would have made The Wolf of Wall Street a more enjoyable movie experience.",6,3,7,2 January 2014
Her," Her -- A Meditation on Intimacy and Its Challenges
","'Her' is without a doubt the most unique love story to come out in years. Written and directed by Spike Jonze – who can never be accused of creating conventional movies – he has come up with a compelling meditation on intimacy and alternatives to loneliness against the background of a futuristic time period.The male protagonist of this different-kind-of love story is Theodore, a nerdy guy played admirably well by Joaquin Phoenix. Unsurprisingly he is challenged when it comes to relationships, especially because his previous (and apparently only) soul mate in life found the thrill was gone at some point and kicked his love to the curb.As he is on the rebound, he purchases a conversationally interactive computer operating system that can not only help the owner shore up some of his or her life shortcoming, but can do so with nuanced (and in this case girl-next-door sexy) dialogue. Scarlett Johansson provides the voice that speaks for 'Samantha,' which inhabits Theodore's newly purchased operating system. The omnipresent Wi-Fi in the futuristic city allows for 24/7 quality time possibilities between Theodore and his 'OS girlfriend.' Amy Adams, who plays Theodore's neighbor and friend with her own relationship issues, adds her actress strengths to the film. The resulting story is one that engages your concern for the characters (no real bad guys in this one) and stimulates your intellect on the question of the staying power of romantic love and the ability of couples to remain into each other.But there is a warning: if you are one of those folks who are relationship challenged – as in having an arduous time in finding a love or even like-interest; or you are in a relationship/marriage where intimacy is deficient – as much as you may enjoy and appreciate this movie, you may find yourself somewhat melancholy upon your departure. This is definitely a movie that can make you contemplate your love situation.On the other hand, if you attend the film with a mate with whom you are in the midst of an intimacy-challenged relationship, Spike Jonze's movie may make you both take an honest look at each other and prompt you to make some changes for the better. Hopefully it won't prompt such couples to engage in the blame game.",Null,2,5,11 January 2014
