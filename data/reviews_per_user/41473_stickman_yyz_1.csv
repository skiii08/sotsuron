3:10 to Yuma," Holes in the plot that can be seen from space.
","I'm very surprised that the usually perceptive and insightful crowd that take the time to critique movies on IMDb seem to be giving this train wreck of a movie so much love. Praising the performances of Bale and Crowe, as well as the fine cinematography and well orchestrated action sequences, is akin to lauding the fine play of the quartet on the deck of the Titanic.Hey, if you're willing to ignore the countless other inconsistencies in the plot, then how about this one; Why didn't Crowe's character, the big boss whom they were all so loyal too, just yell,'HEY, STOP SHOOTING FELLAS! I'M GETTING ON THE TRAIN! NO, SERIOUSLY, I WANT TO GET ON THE TRAIN AND GO TO JAIL! WHY? I....I'M NOT SURE. THIS GUY I WAS JUST KILLING TOLD ME A SAD STORY ABOUT HIS KID. I GUESS THAT'S WHY...ANYWAY, NO MORE SHOOTING AT US, OK?' Let's be honest, anyone willing to overlook the completely ridiculous plot of this movie, because of the elements that were in fact done fairly well, is giving a big thumbs up to the 'powers that be' in Hollywood who consider the movie going public to be a bunch of idiots.",1,11,20,11 January 2008
