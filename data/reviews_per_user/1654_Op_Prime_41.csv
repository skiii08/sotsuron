Alien 3," Oh it was disappointing and bad
","AlienÂ³ takes everything from the first two films and obliterates it. They tried way to hard to scare people by putting in all sorts of gore and showing the Alien everywhere. As I have said in my reviews of Halloween, gore does not equal scary and sadly the makers of this movie could not realize this. The story is good but is dragged down plot holes that occur all throughout the film. While there is some good acting, there are no interesting characters except for Riply (the writers saw to that didn't they). This film seriously lacked the horror of the first film and the action of the second. Where was James Cameron when we needed him?",Null,487,526,4 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Beyond Empire and Jedi
","When I first saw Episode I, I expected it to be below average compared to the other three. After seeing it, I see I was wrong. Episode I is by far better than Empire and Jedi, but not Star Wars. The acting is great, especially Natalie Portman. The special effects are better than every other movie I've ever seen, and the story is superb.",Null,0,1,5 July 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," If you thought Star Wars something...
","This is one of the better films of the eighties and certainly one of Harrison Ford's best movies of all time. Every scene is filled with either action, humor, romance or adventure. Or all of those things combined. This film assured Harrison Ford a successful film career outside Star Wars. Speaking of Star Wars, I find 'Raiders' to be the better film. As for the sequels, 'Raiders' and 'Last Crusade' are very close and it can be hard to choose between them, but 'Raiders' is most certainly better than 'Temple of Doom.'",Null,0,1,2 January 2000
Batman Returns," Rarely seen in sequels
","Sequels rarely come close to the greatness of it's predecessor. While Batman Returns isn't better than the first Batman, it is a great film. Michael Keaton is back and plays Bruce Wayne/Batman just as well as the previous film. Danny DeVito delivers a great performance as the Penguin, as does Pfieffer as Catwoman. The story is again dark and just the way Batman should be. Keaton proves he is the best Batman again, and puts successors Kilmar and Clooney in their place as replacements and not the true Batman.",Null,0,0,14 January 2000
Home Alone," Full of fun
","Home Alone has a rather thin plot but makes up for it with all that cartoon-like violence. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern give wonderful performances and are the best thing in this movie. Macaulay Culkin is an okay actor, nothing special, but okay. Home Alone is best watched during the holidays. That is when it can be most enjoyed.",Null,27,46,16 April 2000
X-Men," Best comic adaptation to date
","Right up there with Superman and Batman, X-Men is a winner. The movie is extremely loyal to the comics, making minor changes but leaving big details (example: origins) intact. The cast is excellent, especially Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin were also good. Of course, like most big budget films, this film has very impressive special effects. I also liked the in jokes (What would you prefer Yellow Spandex?). People who have never read the comics are not going to understand the movie's plot like a fan would. Even fans who did not like the film at least understand it. By the way, there is reason X-Men is on the top 250 list at the time of this writing... it's that good. X-Men will surely bring on sequels (thank you) and inspire other projects (Superman 5) to get made. Hopefully, the sequels will continue to be as good as this film.",7,0,0,7 August 2000
The Terminator," Futuristic action
","Terminator offers a lot of action and adventure with a sci-fi twist. In my opinion, Arnold Schwarzenegger gives one of the best performances of his career. James Cammeron is a genius when it comes to movies like these, as opposed to the pathetic and laughable Titanic. Anyway, Terminator is an excellent movie and it's sequel is just as good.",Null,0,0,18 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Weak compared to Episode IV, awesome compared to Episode V
","Return of the Jedi is superior to The Empire Strikes Back, but is no where near as good as A New Hope. Jedi was a lot less dark than Empire and that was appealing. The final space battle was truly excellent and far better than those of the rest of the original trilogy. And the lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader was even better than the one in Empire. Even the Ewoks could not ruin this for me. Like Empire, Jedi was unable to be as dramatic and amazing as A New Hope. Return of the Jedi does not even come close to A New Hope but it is still a good film. Don't miss it.",Null,3,8,14 April 2000
Alien," The scariest
","While Aliens is my favorite of the series, Alien is way scarier. Sigourney Weaver delivers a great performance. The music and effects are terrific. What makes this movie scarier than the others is because you never know when the Alien is going to appear and who's next to get it. Unlike the sequels, Alien was more about scares then action. Overall, my second favorite of the movie series.",Null,1,3,4 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Force IS Back!
","I've been waiting impatiently for three years for Episode II and the wait was most definitely worth it. Episode II blows away all previous Star Wars movies, with the exception of the original. Actually, the film recaptures much of the spirit and magic of the original.The story is excellent and pure science fiction. It effectively mixes action, adventure, mystery and even love. Now I'm hardly a fan of love stories, but I thought Episode II pulled off the love scenes very well. But, of course, the best parts of any Star Wars movie are the fight scenes. The massive battle with the clone army was fantastic and the fight scene with Count Dooku was excellent, making use of the fantastic special effects.The acting was, of course, great. Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman deliver excellent performances once again. Hayden was actually pretty good as Anakin Skywalker, despite what some say. The other actors were also very good.The only bad thing about this movie was the subtitle, 'Attack of the Clones'. Otherwise, thumbs up! After seeing Episode II, I can't wait for Episode III.",Null,0,3,12 August 2002
Predator," Excellent Sci-Fi/Action movie
","This is a very impressive sci-fi/action flick. Arnold gives a great performance in the kind of the movie I think he's best at: an action movie. Like Terminator and True Lies, Arnold is really great as the serious, action type. There are amazing fight sequences with the Predator, and that is the way it should be. Sure there is gore in this movie, but this movie does not rely on that or special effects. This has story and great actors to perform it. Thumbs way up!",Null,1,2,15 April 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Twice the fun
","Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the Terminator from the future, but this time he has come back to protect it from the T1-1000. This film provided a better look into that grim future the previous movie provided a look at. This movie had better action sequences and effects (that's to be expected when the budget is like $100 million and last film's was like $6.4 million). This movie came out long after Arnold became a big star, which was because of Conan the Barbarian and not because of the first Terminator or Predator, and he still gives great performances. James Cammeron once again delivers an amazing story that makes you sit in suspense and wonder what will happen next. Two thumbs way up!",Null,1,1,18 April 2000
Aliens," This time it's war
","In my opinion, this is the best of the Alien movies. It has great acting, great special effects, and a amazing story. The scene with Riply battling the Alien Queen was superb.",10,1,2,7 June 1999
Die Hard 2," Yippee-ki-yay 2
","While it does not compare to the original Die Hard, Die Hard 2 is a pretty good movie. The stunts and special effects are excellent. My only real complaint is how McClane's gun never seems to run out of bullets. But that's it. The dialogue to this movie is great too. Many memorable lines. Thumbs way up for Die Hard 2.",Null,1,2,30 May 2000
Independence Day," Thumbs way up!
","Independence Day is excellent movie, with spectacular special effects and very good actors. The plot is not perfect and could have used some work, but it left me without any major complaints. The rate at which they found a solution to fight the aliens could be considered unbelievable, but considering the plot of the movie, who really cares? Will they make a sequel to this amazing movie that happened to make over $300 million in the US alone? Duh.",Null,1,2,16 April 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Pales in comparison to the original
","I could see a lot of potential for the sequel of Jurassic Park and this movie tried really hard to live up to it, but in the end it failed miserably. The story was lacking in many places and had some plot holes that could have been avoided. Jeff Goldblum and the special effects are the only high points this movie has. It's worth an occasional viewing now and then, but not worth viewing over and over like the first one.",Null,0,0,15 April 2000
Ghostbusters," The best movie of 1984
",Ghostbusters is without a doubt the best movie of 1984. It introduced something fresh and gave us characters that I doubt no one in this country hasn't heard of. I've seen this movie over 200 hundred times in the past 9 years and I never tire of it.,Null,0,0,7 July 1999
Event Horizon," Horrifying
","Event Horizon is one scary piece of work. The premise of having the ship traveling to a strange, chaos dimension and bringing something 'evil' back with it, is intriguing. While I liked this movie, I felt they went into the gore too much and did not really go far enough to explain where the ship went. In the movie, it is described to be pretty much like Hell, but like Dr. Weir said, 'Hell is just a word. The reality is much, much worse.' That is very chilling. There are some amazing visual effects. I thought Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill gave excellent performances. Like I said, I liked Event Horizon and it was very scary, but it was not without it's flaws. I'd say this film is above average.",Null,0,1,29 April 2000
Toy Story," To Infinity and Beyond!
","The first fully computer animated feature length movie in history is an excellent film. The story is very entertaining and Toy Story has a great voice cast. I could explain the story, but so many others have, so what's the point? Like so many animated movies produced by Disney, this was aimed at children, but who says only they can enjoy it? Thumbs up!",Null,2,3,2 November 2000
Men in Black," Overrated? I don't think so.
","How can anyone call this film overrated? That's a title you would have to give to Titanic, but certainly not MIB. The story line is something similar to the X-Files, but with a more comedic twist. There are also very impressive special effects. The actors have great chemistry together, especially Smith and Jones. MIB is one of the best films ever.",Null,0,0,16 April 2000
Toy Story 2," The Toys are Back in Town
","Better than the original, Toy Story 2 is a very entertaining movie. The animation is much better than the original, looking more realistic. The story is clever and unique. Sequels are almost never considered even half as good as the original. Toy Story 2 is one of those rare cases. Rent this movie.Toy Story 3? Sounds good to me.",Null,0,1,2 November 2000
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Same plot. Same actors. New traps. No problem.
","Home Alone 2 has pretty much the same plot as the first movie, but Home Alone 2 is a very good sequel. The new traps for the Wet, er... Sticky Bandits are great. Once again Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern give wonderful performances. Having Tim Curry in this was also a treat. There is a lot of enjoyment in this movie.",Null,73,96,16 April 2000
The Fly," A great movie!
","The Fly is without a doubt one of the best movies to come out of the 1980s. Jeff Goldblum gives a fantastic performance in the leading role. The movie is a perfect blend of science fiction and horror. There is also some humor to lighten things up, but beware, this movie is not for those with weak stomaches. There are quite a few things in The Fly that would gross some out. In the end, however, it really adds to the power and drama of this movie. Hands down, an excellent movie. Thumbs up.",Null,0,1,17 October 2001
Titanic," Star Trek 5 is more enjoyable
","Yeah, you heard me. The worst Star Trek movie ever made is more fun to watch than this over rated piece of garbage. It is a disaster flick. Nothing more. Acting is horrible, with exception of Billy Zane who is able to do a decent job. The special effects are the only thing going for this film. I normally enjoy movies from James Cameron (Aliens, Terminator) but I found this to be horrible. And by the way, DiCaprio can't act and that's why he didn't get an Oscar for this slop. Avoid this movie at all costs and go see with entertainment value.",1,3,10,15 January 2000
Die Hard," Yippee-ki-yay
","Bruce Willis gives a amazing performance in perhaps one of the best movies of the 1980s. This is an action/adventure movie for the ages. There are a lot of great scenes, including the scene where Bruce Willis leaps off the rooftop and crashes trough the window. I never thought it would be so good when I first saw it, but I was wrong. Don't miss one of Willis' best films of all time.",Null,106,192,15 April 2000
Army of Darkness," Comedy and horror rolled into one
","Okay, maybe it's more comedy than horror, but who cares? Army of Darkness is an awesome movie. Bruce Campbell does an excellent job as Ash, the arrogant and hilarious hero armed with his trusty chainsaw and 'boom stick'. The plot was great and fresh, showing that the people behind the scenes were not trying to do the same thing that made Evil Dead I & II popular. The movie is filled with sword swinging skeletons, kick boxing witches and slap stick. Bruce Campbell has some excellent one liners. To sum it up, Army of Darkness is groovy.But you can let it end here. Give us another sequel please.",Null,89,107,2 June 2000
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Yippee-ki-yay: With a Vengeance
","I felt the third film of the series is better than Die Hard 2, but not the original. This one acted funnier than the others, but that's not a bad thing. Also, it was set in one main building like the first two. This movie was out there, running all over the place. Bruce Willis, Jeremy Irons and Samuel L. Jackson are great in this movie. Vengeance also has great action sequences and a very good plot. To sum it up in one word: fantastic.",Null,1,2,2 June 2000
Jaws," The first and the best
","Jaws is a fantastic, non stop thriller. The effects are not that great, but what can you expect? This movie was made nearly 25 years ago. The movie has something that makes it so fun. It might be scary but for some, that makes it worth watching. The suspense is a key element to the film's greatness. Never knowing when the shark is going to show up makes this movie very exciting. I could watch this movie a million times and never get be bored.",Null,0,1,4 October 1999
Scream," Slasher genre reborn
","Before I review this wonderful movie, I'd like to give you all a brief history of slasher flicks. Halloween created this genre. Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street revolutionized it. And Child's Play nearly destroyed it. Scream of course saved this dying genre which by the 1990s barely turned out a good horror film (excluding New Nightmare and Halloween 6 & 7 of course).Scream is a classic and Wes Craven is a genius. He realized what John Carpenter realized with the first Halloween, gore doesn't equal scary. Sure, you see a lot of blood here, but the movie doesn't rely on it. Scream has a story and great scares.During the film, it is impossible to not wonder who it is and why. You can't just sit there and not think, 'maybe it's the deputy or then again maybe it's the guy who keeps talking about the rules of a good scary movie.' Scream is wonderful slasher film that is a non stop ride of action, suspense, thrills and even a little comedy. A must see.",Null,0,0,26 December 1999
Halloween," John Carpenter is the master of terror
","The movie that started the slasher craze is probably the best of them all. Halloween is what every kind of slasher film should be; suspense, character development, story, etc. I have seen other slasher films (like New Nightmare) but none of them have surpassed this movie in any way. The plot is so realistic. A little boy commits murder and seems so innocent, so no one considers him to be very dangerous, except for Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) who goes after Micheal Myers when he escapes from a sanitarium and goes home. One of the best qualities of this film is how Micheal is always hiding in the shadows, until he goes after someone of course. Also, how there is no gore. When a movie has a lot of gore, you can tell there is no story and the gore is just a distraction. The best horror film ever!",Null,0,2,24 October 1999
Back to the Future Part II," Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads!
","Now Part II, as well as III, do not live up to the original film, but this is still an entertaining film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are back again, giving great performances again. The film offers a look into the future and even disrupts the present, adding a touch of originality. The sequel had great special effects, like the hovering Delorean and skateboard. See it today.",Null,0,1,4 May 2000
Space Jam," It's got game
","Space Jam is a very enjoyable movie featuring probably the most popular cartoon characters ever. The plot may seem rather weak to you and me, but let's not forget that this movie was made for children. Space Jam has all the humor of the classic shorts that made us love Bugs, Daffy and all the rest. Michael Jordan actually wasn't that bad in this movie, considering he is not a professional actor. Bill Murray was very hilarious. Thumbs up on this one.'That's all folks!'",Null,52,69,25 September 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The Ultimate Nightmare
","Nightmare on Elm Street is perhaps one of the most original and scary horror movies of all time. Wes Craven wrote and directed a very unique film (proving my theory yet again). The film is gory, but it's also scary. Gore is simply gross without any kind of scare. The acting is terrific, especially Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund. The interesting aspect to this film is that you don't even know who the killer is until way into the film. Freddy is also at his best here. He rarely talks at all, giving no cheesy one liners. By far the best Nightmare of all.",Null,0,0,24 October 2000
The Matrix," Believe the Unbelievable
","The Matrix is an awesome sci-fi movie. The special effects and fight scenes are spectacular. The story is very unique and a rather original concept for any kind of movie, not just science fiction. The cast is great, even Keanu, who appears to have come a long way since the hilarious Bill and Ted.I am looking forward to the sequels.",Null,1,2,2 October 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," An adventure for all times
","Star Wars is a timeless story that can be enjoyed by anyone. Though I consider myself a Star Trek fan, I still enjoy watching any of the Star Wars films. This movie was unpredictable and that contributed to its greatness.",10,0,0,27 June 1999
Cube," Fantastic cinema
","Cube is an intense film that excites and fills you with suspense. The cast is fantastic in this low budget, but awesome film. Even for a small budget, the effects are great. The whole movie is mysterious and filled with deadly traps. But there were a few questions that remained unanswered. How did they get there? What is the purpose of the Cube? I also thought the ending was kind of a let down, but somewhat real. Nothing is really as it seems in this movie. It makes you think. Thumbs way up.",Null,5,12,19 May 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Secrets and suspense
","Filled with secrets and suspense, The Empire Strikes Back is worthy sequel to the 1977 classic. Good special effects, great music and story and a excellent lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader.",Null,0,0,19 July 1999
Aladdin," Imagine if you had three wishes, three hopes, three dreams and they all could come true.
","Aladdin is without a doubt one of Disney's better movies. The animation is excellent. The characters are very realistic, surprising and rare for an animated movie. The songs are very good and memorable (favorite has to 'Friend Like Me'). Many pop culture references are here and even if you do not notice them, they are made very hilarious by Robin Williams. Williams provides the comic relief which is vital to the movie's success. This is one of the best Disney movies in the last decade, if not ever.",Null,5,7,27 September 2000
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The best
","This by far is better than Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Temple of Doom. This was well written, and had both action and humour. Sean Connery is great as Indiana Jones' father and it was great to see John Rhys-Davies' character in the film. One of Harrison Ford's best movies.",9,0,1,28 June 1999
Back to the Future," Classic films for all ages
","Back to the Future is one of the most original and unique movie of the 1980s. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd have great chemistry together, which the film benefits from. Tom Wilson is also great as Biff. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale came up with a great script. Also great special effects. Thumbs up.",Null,3,5,4 May 2000
Jurassic Park," A timeless adventure
","Jurassic Park was an amazing film. The computer graphics were spectacular and an amazing site for all to see. The plot is incredibly original. Many scenes were very suspenseful, including the scenes with the raptors and the T-Rex. The actors are very good, especially Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum. There were some neat character developing scenes, but I liked the scenes with the dinos more. A lot more fun there. Thumbs way up!",Null,3,4,15 April 2000
