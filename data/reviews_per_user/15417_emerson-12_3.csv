Casablanca," It had everything...
","I'll be brief.  Casablanca is probably one of my favorite movies.  It has romance, intrigue, a cast of interesting characters, good guys, bad guys, moral choices, and classic quotes.  In other words, it had everything. While many movies (especially more recent films) have all this and more, Casablanca holds a special place in my heart.  So, as you watch, think of the film more as a symbol rather than trying to compare it to other great films. Casablanca stands alone.",10,1,1,28 November 1999
Kelly's Heroes," War & Comedy
","If anyone needs to see a film with classic star power, excellent comedy, great music, and exciting action sequences, see Kelly's Heroes. Personally I enjoyed the plot, an odd twist to most war films, and the humor of Rickles and Sutherland. 'Rof-Rof-Rof.  That's my other dog impersonation...'",9,1,2,6 September 1999
True Romance," Great cast
","Tarantino did well in writing this film.  I have mixed feelings about his acting, writing, and directing talents - in other words, I hate Natural Born Killers and From Dusk Till Dawn, and love Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. True Romance is added to the love list.  The great cast and respectable plot, combined with Tarantino's wit, make True Romance a quality film.  I give it an 8 out of 10. The best scene is with Dennis Hopper being interrogated by Christopher Walken and his thugs.",8,0,1,28 November 1999
