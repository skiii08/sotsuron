Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," One of the worst films ever made
","I really can't see what people saw in this. I was told that it was better than the last one, but all I saw was a confused mess that made no sense whatsoever. Apart from Jared Harris the acting was universally atrocious. Even the normally reliable Robert Downey Jr was bad. For once I agree with the newspaper reviews. This was definitely NOT Sherlock Holmes. The relationship between Holmes and Watson was played mainly for laughs and was strained to breaking point. If you're going to make a film a Holmes you should make sure the characters are true to the original source. Conan Doyle's Holmes and Watson were three-dimensional characters, so much so that some Americans think they were actually real people - the characters in this film were one-dimensional at best. The set pieces were overlong and boring. I was so bored I actually fell asleep for a few minutes (the only other film I fell asleep in was Attack of the Clones). If you want to watch a much more thoughtful and superior version try watching the second series of the BBCs Sherlock (which covers some of the same ground). All in all a big steaming dog turd of a film.",1,23,46,3 May 2012
