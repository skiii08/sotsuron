Alien 3," Not as abominable as mentioned, it's watchable but fairly mediocre
","If this would really be an awful film I would not have chosen to watch it again. If you want to see awful go see the Alien vs Predator flicks. Those deserve 1/10 ratings and are simply B-movies, made without talent.But this film has interesting characters in a setting we haven't seen in the Alien films before, with more depth than any of the other films. While it's true that it doesn't help to have a leading character that is going to die for sure combined with lowlife thugs, you may not care about them. I did care about the Charles S Dutton guy and the doctor who died way too soon. They made a mistake there. Finally Ripley is a bit sexier and has a relationship with an interesting man but he's one of the first to go. And yes there are more mistakes. It does not make sense that Ripley stays alive for so long before the chest burster comes out and that she didn't drown long before that. Beyond that others have pointed out plenty of other plot holes. One thing I don't get and remains unexplained is how exactly this alien is different...yes it's smaller and has a different color...but why??? The movie lacks much of the suspense and shock moments that the first Alien had. Also, graphically, it's rather monotonous in color. David Fincher has made better films and this one is no where near as gripping as Seven.But of all the films it probably has the best acting. Weaver is brilliant in each film which is why they kept asking her, as the popular heroine Ripley she's guaranteed to generate plenty of cash for the box office and she sets an example how to portray a real strong and heroic, but still fragile and feminine character of flesh and blood (not a single actress has come even close to her performances i.m.o.). Dutton and Charles Dance are very good too.That and addiction to the Alien series with Weaver makes the film worth watching. I consider the 4th installment to be the worst, because it had too much caricatures, in this film, the people are more real and you really get the sense there is a community they live in, no matter how humble and grim.",7,3,54,5 July 2008
Requiem for a Dream," Uncomfortably hypnotic
","Wow there's a lot of comments on this film. It seems like everyone was somehow impressed and needed to write down what the movie meant for them. This movie is not a masterpiece but it's still great, and very emotionally draining, unlike most movies.Although all the characters are addicts (Burstyn becoming an addict of diet pills...are these legal??) they are all sympathetic and they make you care about them and their dreams. The movie starts out depicting the relationship between the characters. As the movie progresses all the characters tumble more and more into a maelstrom of misery, ending in a very uncompromising and strong ending that will shock the viewer.That ending is a bit exaggerated (getting thrown in jail just for having heroin injection wounds, electroshock therapy without sedation or consulting first, even amputation!) but it will blow you away, leaving you with a feeling like you just got hit with a sledge hammer. The exaggeration is a typical American aspect for films and I can't really say it's always bad but as a European I have more respect for subtlety and I liked the way the topic was handled more lightly in Trainspotting.IMHO, the message delivered here is, however, not simply 'don't do drugs'. It's not even a movie that focuses on drugs as a problem (like Traffic, another good movie), it focuses on more universal problems: abuse, lack of attention to old people, lack of love and care. This is done in a convincing way and the acting is superb. Besides the exaggeration my negatives are it's repetitivity (the same music and the same montage with the close-up on the eyes with every fix are repeated over and over again to try to hypnotize the viewer, however, to me it came across as semi-hip. The great Trainspotting is a lot funnier and more hip. But Requiem for a dream is still a seriously great film for it's acting, sensitivity and effective camera-work.8 out of 10",Null,0,1,25 June 2003
Star Trek," Never a dull moment.
","Awesome film. For both Trekkies and non Trekkies there's lots to like:-Fanservice. There are some references to the old Trek and some answers to details that were left vague there.-Casting. Simply splendid. Chris Pine should be considered a new star on the rise. Zachary Quinto was a very good pick for Spock and Karl Urban was instantly recognizable as McCoy, the other members did great as well with Simon Pegg as Scotty being the coolest.-Special Effects. Not in itself reason enough to go see something but this film is a pure visual feast, both what you see in and outside of the Enterprise is pure Eyecandy.-Story. Not as rock solid as the rest (see my spoiler post in the message board) but it was involving and the characters were given enough space and character to get to know them. Very well dosed with humor action and emotion, a terrific mix. Well done.-Music. When you watch the trailer: awesome music score, somehow that tune was not featured in the film that much. Beastie Boys in the beginning seemed a little out of place but overall the soundtrack does not detract from the experience and enhances it when it should.Simply two thumbs up who would have thought that? I was very skeptical when reading they would rehash Trek...but the way they did it was admirable. Go see this!",8,2,10,13 May 2009
Fight Club," Great movie, ridiculous ending
","Contains spoiler in the last paragraphThe ending of this movie is famous as one of the all-time plot twists, for me however it almost completely spoiled what was an intelligent, thought-provoking movie with a lot of style and cult appeal to youngsters, by the very capable director of Seven who admits to just making 'MTV-films' in his modesty.The film has many quotable oneliners, and Tyler Durden says a lot of things to think about ('We don't have a great war, we don't have a great depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives.' or 'You're not the clothes you wear. You're not you're job...' etc. etc.). Wonderful dialogues (or should I say monologues) and I love Brad Pitt's performance, I already knew he wasn't just a pretty boy because I saw him in Twelve Monkeys, he's got a great voice and a certain rebellious coolness.Besides critizicing the consumption society I think the movie has a lot more to say. One of the most important topics is rediscovering malehood (this is no joke, there are actually guru's who give seminars on this). Women will deny it but society has become very feminine with it's increased communication, meetings, talkshows, the endless shopping, the huge influence of fashion and the typically feminist illusion that work is all-glorifying. We don't get to see a Meat Loaf with breasts for nothing, I thought that was clearly a message. Men turn to violence more and more because of lack of control and power, a sign of weakness. Having bigger muscles no longer helps in this society, having a good lawyer and a good career does. In this movie men try to rebel against this society by returning to a primitive but very essential state of malehood. Just as men fought for their lives in ancient history, these men fight to feel alive. And this movie shows this in a promising way..only to end with a ridiculous plot twist...Tyler Durden is an alter ego?? Norton was just punching himself in the face?? And he survives a gunshot in the throat?? Yes, you've read that correctly, in the throat. According to my limited medical knowledge this sort of results in a certain lack of much needed oxygen?? Sure, I guess it was luck and the shot just missed the lungs, but how believable is this?? Chance of one in a million. So, I really hated the ending and it ruined a great movie. Too bad, really too bad. It still has it's moments, therefore:7,5 ouf of 10",Null,1,3,27 June 2003
Shakespeare in Love," The most overrated movie of all times
","This movie is extremely mediocre. As a comedy, it's a complete failure because there's not one joke worth laughing, with it's humor being so incredibly lame and old. As a costume piece, it's very forgettable because the performances are so exaggerated you never really care about any of the characters.And the worst thing about the movie is probably Gwyneth Paltrow, who people think can act well because she can talk in a posh English accent. I've never seen someone so cold and heartless in a romantic film.Like most people have notices the 7 Oscars were ridiculous, it may be an ok movie for a sunday afternoon if you absolutely have nothing better to do, but the film is best avoided, a terrible bore. Mind you, I like period pieces and most of the time I don't even mind if it's a romantic drama or comedy. But this pile of crap is just not worth to be mentioned.People probably liked the title, and their mindless adoration of Shakespeare, who most people don't even read, turned it into an out-of-the-blue Oscar rain. There were tons of better films made in 1998, such as Elizabeth, The Truman Show, American History X, The Big Lebowski, and A Simple Plan!I gave it 1 out of 10 just to try to balance up things.",1,17,34,17 January 2004
Alien: Resurrection," Disappointing despite creative effort
","The action scenes are well thought out and there's plenty of gore. But it lacks character and suspense, it gets kind of formulaic.Joss Whedon has written plenty of good scripts for both movies, TV shows as well as comics and this is definitely not his worst. It's a bit more creative than it's predecessor Alien 3, but the characters have less depth. The film is also more uneven, switching from action flick to surreal and gross splatter film, the wisecracks getting in the way of real suspense.Winona Ryder does her part but it's not as memorable as Lance Henriksen's. Her character as well as some others were more grotesque than engaging. Also I don't find this Sigourney Weaver's best performance, while it was refreshing for herself, playing an alien-human clone, she wasn't as likable because she seemed to care less about the fate of humankind. Like in Alien3, the problem was again that you can't really care much about any of the characters. And too many of them make it out alive this time.It was missing the human element as well and that was one thing Alien3 did better as well as the classic ones, Alien and Aliens.Still, plenty of entertainment and not boring for a moment. An OK 7 out of 10.",7,1,1,5 July 2008
Juno," Highly praised and best avoided
","This is one of those comedies that will make the viewer check the IMDb or the label of the rental DVD again, asking: 'this is a comedy?'.While it is clear the film is trying to be funny, through constructed teen dialogues with intended 'cleverness' and cheap sarcasm, it never really raises a good laugh. Definitely not the actors fault, it was just lacking a sincerely funny script.If you really want to watch a valuable and funny film featuring a sarcastic teenage girl, watch Ghost World.There is very little conflict and tempo in this film. It's entire plot line: 'OMG I'm pregnant, what now?' Personally I have a policy that if a film still bores me after half an hour, i stop viewing it. I did in this case and was glad to read that it would have been a waste of time sitting it through because nothing would have happened in it anyway.Still a 5 out of 10 because it partially seems a matter of taste and I suspect some (I guess girls) will like the film. The only reason it got an Oscar was that it had an only slightly fresh style in the first 5 minutes with some animations which hardly defined the movie. I would not be surprised if Oscar committee members never watch more than the first 5 minutes. It would explain most of the Oscar handouts a lot better than detailed analyses of why Oscar winning movies suck so much for watchers who actually sit them through.We'll probably see more of Ellen Page but this was hardly a challenging film for her to do, you're better off watching Hard Candy.",5,3,12,15 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Very underrated!! A satisfying ending to a wonderful trilogy.
","A lot of people complain about (Return of the) Jedi. Especially the Ewoks get much criticism. 'Only for children'. Also the countless aliens ('muppets in space'). And then there's the second Death Star and a return to Tatooine ('more of the same')I seriously think Jedi only has 1 minor flaw. The scene where the biker scout gets tapped on the back as a distraction was really stupid. But that doesn't ruin the great experience this film is. This movie has as much action as the previous Star Wars films combined. It has everything: a space armada battle (lacking in Empire), a spectacular lightsaber duel, blaster battles, out-of-this-world creatures, humour and pace. There is also no lack of drama with the developed friendship between the main characters and Luke finally discovering his destiny. The ending could not have been better and was very satisfying.A lot of people tend to forget what sets Star Wars so much apart from  every other movie: design. There's so much design, of spaceships, vehicles, backdrops, numerous aliens, characters and outfits..and it's all brilliant, it's art! It's what makes the Star Wars universe so unique and such a wonderful place for people to spend some time in. But people, including the 'intellectual' film critics, are blind to this and all they can do is complain. How onedimensional. 10 out of 10",10,0,0,28 June 2003
Pan's Labyrinth," Very tragic, grabs you by the throat
","This is a very sad, dark fantasy film with quite some realism. From the beginning on, you will somehow suspect that things will not go uphill and bad things will happen. But when they do, they won't leave you untouched. The tragedy unfolds more and more, with slight glimpses of hope here and there, until the climax will leave you in tears. I can't remember the last time a film moved me like that.Even though I am more fond of emotionally uplifting films this is such a brilliant, elegant and efficiently told film (at the cost of having caricatures) that it must be seen. Like most great fantasy films (Neverending story, Labyrinth)there is the idea that imagination should be cherished, rather than ridiculed (which the adults of course do in this film). And like in those classics, but in a much bleaker way, there is also a harsh reality that has to be faced.While depressing, the film ends on a positive note. Even though the killings that occur are meaningless, the lives that were taken were not. The idea that everyone is special (the main character is told she's a princess) and the value of self sacrifice are the ones to stick to despite all the misery.",8,2,5,12 June 2007
Lost in Translation," Music camouflages it's weak humour and poor script.
","This movie had a very, very small script that I think could have been written within approximately 3 days. How it could have ever won an Oscar is beyond me, but for me it is clear that Francis Ford Coppola's darling daughter needs much work on her writing skills. The most clear sign of weakness was the overuse of music. The movie is chockfull with 'alternative' rock music, which was mostly nice, but I could not help but think this was an all too easy way to fill up the movie and camouflage the lack of story and pace. And all the music was just existing pop and rock, not specifically made for the film. I think it is weak to just grab you collection of favorite CD's and put the best parts of those in your movie and try to make it better that way. If music is going to play a major role in a film I would like it to be either originally written for the movie or something I haven't heard before. I despise the lack of true creativity here, I had the same problem with the Kill Bill films.Now, of course, there are plenty of motion pictures that use a lot of existing music to add to the atmosphere, like American Graffiti, and I understand that in this picture the intention was the same. However I felt that this movie could have been so much more had it been written less poorly, if it had more and stronger dialogue, and some tragicomical humour which I mostly missed.The humour in this comedy is not ha-ha-comedy, but it does not appeal in any other way either and is therefore failed as well. I know the Japanese can be very odd but this is not something new, nor is it shown in an amusing way. The movie hits rock bottom when Murray and Johansson go out in Tokyo with all kinds of Japanese rent-a-friends and start dancing and singing to various awful music. The scene was tormentingly long as well.On a more positive note, the performances were all right and Murray and Johansson admittedly make the film a lot better than it could have been (i.e. a turd). The imagery of Tokyo is also pleasant though sometimes shortlived.And it won at least one Oscar. So there's your recipe for an Oscar film:-let an actor or actress play a role against typecasting that he/she has not done before (Bill Murray in a serious role, Charlize Theron as an overweight serial killer, Nicole Kidman with a nose job, Dustin Hoffman as an autist and the list goes on and on).-write a weak romantic story with a twist and cover up it's weakness with lots of music to add feeling;(-make sure the Oscar committee will vote in favour of Daddy's little girl because she's the daughter of Francis Ford 'The Godfather' Coppola.)As for romantic stories with a twist watch the infinitely superior Groundhog Day with Bill Murray. Now that movie actually WAS Oscarworthy.5 out of 10",Null,1,2,20 April 2004
Watchmen," Unbalanced but interesting
","This one's definitely worth more than one watch. Not only does it show superheroes far more flawed, in a darker way than Hellboy does, it also shows a meticulously constructed alternative history with Nixon and Kissinger still in the 80s government.Overall the film is done very well graphically. The action scenes are spares but good while animations and backdrops are gorgeous. Costumes and atmosphere were great. A lot of classic 60s-80s songs used but it was done well. Definitely one to go see in High Definition with the best possible sound.The Watchmen are each interesting characters. The casting of each of them was pretty good overall and my favorite is Matthew Goode as Adrian Veidt, the enigmatic Ozymandias.Rorschach was too much of a walking cliché, the type of hard nosed vigilante that seems to smoke too much cigarettes to be able to talk normally. While he looks short and thin, he is way too fast and strong to be believable in this film. Earley's performance without his mask is impressive nonetheless.Like the Silk Spectre II, these characters do not really have superpowers yet they somehow beat the living hell out of any opponent with just their fists and feet. This is where the realism was lost too much at times. At times it would also get overly violent, particularly in the prison scenes related to Rorschach.Ozymandias has no real superpower other than being exceptionally bright and fast in combat while also being outrageously rich and successful.Dr Manhattan is the coolest of the Watchmen, actually being the only one to have superpowers like light speed travel, increasing/multiplying himself, manipulating matter at atomic level and what not. He also walks around naked most of the time which I thought was amusing, but does make sense from his perspective: why should he care? The combination of sadness and decreasing care for ordinary humans in his face is done well.The Comedian is killed early but with all the flash forwards and flash backs he gets plenty of screen time. Good actor too. The most insane and evil of the bunch, he is actually the only one sane enough to use fire arms. It was weird to see so few relying on them.The Director's Cut is great and pays a bit more attention to the sympathetic first Nite Owl.Say what you want but I found this film much more interesting than the overrated Dark Knight, it shows more morally grey areas while there's no clear distinction between heroes and villains.",9,2,4,25 March 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not as bas as I expected, but it could have been much better
","This movie has pretty much everything you expect from a Terminator film. Plenty of action and great fx. There were some important things missing though.First of all, I think the casting could have been better. In the making of Arnold said that they went through 10.000s of auditions and that Kristanna Loken was by far the best. I find that a little hard to believe. She's not really bad but far from flawless in portraying a robot. She shows human emotions all the time, either aggression or an evil grin. T-X is not half as frightening as T-1000, and I think here lies the main problem of the film. She's pretty much your average blonde bimbo except that she is programmed to kill people. T-X does not even come close to Robert Patricks great performance. Kristanna Loken wasn't much more than a supermodel shooting rockets out of her arm. And I don't think that Nick Stahl was believable either, as a supposedly charismatic would-be rebel leader. The only good casting choices were Claire Danes and (obviously)Arnie.
Besides the casting this Terminator film clearly suffers from not being a James Cameron film. Even though it's better than I expected, it simply lacked the suspense and atmosphere that especially the first Terminator film had. The action scenes were pretty much cloned from T2 (car chases with trucks...hmmm where did we see that before?). Don't get me wrong, Terminator 3 is a very entertaining action film. It's just that the emphasis lies too much on action. The sci-fi elements and suspense/horror elements are pretty much neglected. T-X is not scary for a moment, nor is Skynet's artificial intelligence taking over the world. It would take a better filmmaker (hint: Cameron) to add a darker atmosphere, as well as a good music score (i.e. the original music score, which was abandoned here). What's left is good, enjoyable popcorn entertainment with a couple of new gadgets, nothing more.As a final note, I think it would be far more interesting to actually see the postapocalyptic war between the machines and humans, of which we've seen interesting glimpses in the Terminator movies. Bring on T4!7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,23 July 2003
Drive," Passable
","This film was OK. Often slow and understated, it looked good and had some mystery to it because of the main character. Unfortunately he gets less and less believable. He's not just a great driver but also an excellent stuntman. Oh and he's also a natural born mechanic. Oh and he can take out any random mafioso muscle with his bare hands and knows how to quickly grab any handgun or rifle they're carrying, as well as easily grab their knives out of their hands, even when just stabbed and heavily bleeding....Refn's films had a reputation for dreaminess, don't look for realism in this picture. But I did emotionally connect with the neighbours of the protagonist like he did himself. Plus there's a nice atmosphere, nice synth soundtrack but it doesn't fit too well with the brutally violent crime story narrative.After having watched part of Neon Demon I felt this film would hold my attention for longer and it did with some shock moments but it was rather those of the cheap kind and certainly not cinematic splendor.But mostly the film does what it was probably intended to do, to keep you on the edge of your seat at least a little bit like a decent crime thriller, rather than all sorts of raving about the next cinematic masterpiece. If only it had more suspense, a lot of things just went way too easy for the protagonist as if he had been killing bad guys all his life.",6,0,0,18 January 2017
The Mist," Stephen King all the way, not too original though
","I really like Stephen King films, even if they're just in his storyteller's style without the story actually been his (movies like Creepy Crawlers). Townsfolk, real communities, people you can care about are usually given some room for characterizations before bad things start to happen and this one is no different.This is not the most original horror movie ever (Dawn of the Dead and The Fog come to mind among a slew of monster movies) and it's certainly not the best as some claim. The only monster we have never seen before is in the ending and it doesn't get much action. Yup, it's about monsters. And the real monsters are the humans when they're desperate and scared.It's a good, enjoyable film though with good acting. Never a dull moment and you really keep wondering...what's next. The hysteric ranting about the apocalypse does fit in well because at first it seems like they're struck with one biblical plague after another.An OK film that's worth a view if you like Stephen King films. Some mentioned Ctulhu and the story definitely seems inspired by H.P. Lovecraft at some point (won't spoil it). I would definitely love to see film adaptations of that writer. It seems King has had his share now, time to move on to a long-overlooked author.",7,0,2,13 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Nothing special: don't believe the hype!
","TDK was a passable film, worth a single watch, nothing more. If you'd start to ask the Nolan fanboys what they really, really liked, you get answers like:-Well, it was dark! -Heath Ledger was brilliant! -It was realistic! -It's a Christopher Nolan film!In reality, in all of these aspects, the movie is a joke. It's an OK film in plenty of aspects, but in the departments it receives it's high praise it's completely undeserved.TDK never gets truly dark. Batman never kills, he's never morally grey. Yes, The Joker is a real psycho. Woopty-doo.Heath Ledger had a nice sound effect on his voice, created in the studio, makeup did the rest. It was not THAT special.Many plot holes have already been pointed out, it's not a realistic film. But what's awful is that it pretends to be. Realism cannot be the primary goal for films about the fantastic, or it may get too boring.Nolan has made far more interesting films and while he's a fan of the Bat, he's not cut out to make superhero films at all. His Gotham City looks bland, boring and devoid of personality. He's not much of a visual story teller, his talent lies in playing around with inventive concepts and plot twists. He always casts the same people too, which is really boring and cowardly. Would be nice to see more new faces there's plenty of talent out there. Tim Burton makes the same mistake but at least he made a more colourful Gotham City.",6,3,5,19 February 2017
Into the Wild," True freedom
","Give this film a chance and be patient...When I first zapped through this film a bit to see what it was like, I had the feeling I would not like it, could not identify with it's characters and it was portraying the main character, the adventurous, reckless Chris, as 'good' (basically telling me, who is just watching a film sitting on my chair, is 'bad' because I am so unlike him).Fortunately, the film does not judge, which is why it's so powerful. There are a lot of emotions from people and a lot of questions asked, but there is no winner or loser, no one is right or wrong, no definitive answer. Of course people do not need movies to think but this one poses questions that few would ask themselves ever. We take a lot of things for granted when it comes down to choosing a path in life. Study, career, family, they seem rather unavoidable.Chris chooses to get away from all this and finds true freedom, with a price. He is no hero, but by god, does he have the courage to let go of the life as it was mapped out for him! A lot of us don't.I don't think the film is beautiful because of the scenery, it's the acting, the emotional richness and the very relevant philosophical questions it poses. I am not going to change my whole life because of it, but am more aware of the traps it can have if I stick too much to the familiar path.",8,0,1,20 December 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Overrated Kubrick film
","This movie suffers the same fault as all other Kubrick films, being ponderously slow. As soon as the space adventure starts, this does add to the realism however, giving a good idea what it's like being in space.The beginning of the movie (the monkey business) is, on the other hand, a torture to watch and listen to. It's not thought-provoking, necessary or entertaining in any way! What was Kubrick thinking when making that intro? It spoils a large part of the movie, in fact the first hour is best skipped for it's tediousness. The second part gets much better with the homicidal Hal computer which strives for it's own survival by any means necessary and the mysterious (alien?) Monolith. I must say, no matter how fascinating others might think it is, this did seem a story that even the writers themselves didn't understand. What you get is a vague and pretentious plot line with more questions than answers. This would not be a bad thing if it weren't for the fact that the questions evolve around trying to understand the plot rather than genuinely interesting issues. All in all that makes this a grossly overrated film, which intellectuals around the world will adore nonetheless because the less people that understand it, the more the smarties will like it, after all it's so much fun feeling smarter than others, is it not? 6,5 out of 10",Null,1,3,24 May 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," More about action, less about characters and plot
","The Matrix Reloaded was a hugely hyped film that was meant to do the impossible: to be better than the brilliant original. The novelty has already gone while the main strength of the original, despite groundbreaking fx, was it's great story. That story has now already been told. Mr Anderson turning into Neo, The One, becoming his true self and finding out the stunning truth.So, what is left after this? More action. Lots more. Surely, more spectacular and over-the-top, but more is not always more. The movie fails in introducing interesting new characters and the dialogue is extremely dull, lacking the humour and spunk of the first movie. We're supposed to believe Neo and Trinity (and I still don't get why she is called that) truly love each other with a sex scene? I'll prefer the Han Solo-Princess Leia romance anytime. And where are the little comic reliefs like the Mouse character in the first movie? Furthermore, where is the suspense? Do we really fear for Neo's life now that he has found out about his superpower, taking on 100's of Agent Smith clones and flying around like superman? I'll prefer an unprepared Luke Skywalker challenging Vader in 'Empire' anytime. It was like the Wachovsky Brothers took out everything likeable about Anime (character develeopment, little distincion between good and evil, insecureties and weaknesses of the hero) and substituted it for bland American comicbook Superheroism.The plot can be summarized as the following: sentinels heading towards Zion plus Neo having to find Keymaker that is needed for access to the Matrix Mainframe. This, between the boring dialogue (except perhaps for the dialogue in the ending with the maker and the chitchat with that French dude), is filled up with an extended version of the trailer. Yup, that's it. The trailer already showed small parts of all the action scenes, leaving no surprising action scenes. All in all, a disappointment. What went wrong in a production that was so obviously dedicated (making us wait 4 years) in creating a superior sequel. The only comfort I can take in it is that they probably wanted to save the best for last.So, all we have is action? Are they any good? Certainly. The Attack of the Smith Clones should become legendary and is unseen in film history. The car chase is extremely complex and long. Furthermore, more kungfu than guns which is a good thing. My only problem was that Laurence Fishburnes moves looked a bit slow.One more thing: that whole techno/tribal dance thing in Zion, after Morpheus speech, it was rather ridiculous. Don't get me wrong I like techno, but it just seemed out of place.So, sequels still suck, most of the time....bummer! 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,6 June 2003
The Good Shepherd," Too slow, unrewarding, fragmented, pretentious, chaotic and pointless
","This film is extremely inefficient, pointless, emotionless and suspenseless (save a few moments in the last hour). After two hours of watching I still found myself unrewarded for my patience. I didn't care anymore, it was going nowhere slow. A great movie is supposed to fascinate you from beginning to end, not to let you wait 2 hours for that to happen.There are countless characters and scenes which are completely unnecessary and get in the way of what could otherwise have been an interesting film. The way the plot swings back and forth to several periods (WW II era, fifties, sixties) is also very chaotic, under the pretense of being ingenious which only makes it worse.Because there's so much bits and pieces floating around it never can get deep. This film is too eager to move on to each next fragment of a story that has no clear direction. A poorly structured scenario is to blame in which a lot less important or even meaningless fragments could have been left out.No great cast could have saved this disaster. Imagine this film not being made by de Niro and not be played by the allstar cast it had. What value would it have? 1 out of 10 to compensate for the blind admiration of Great Names, this film is clearly overrated. I advise to go read the next chapter of your book instead of watching this yawn.",1,52,89,20 June 2007
Iron Man," Satisfying from start to finish!
","One of the best superhero films, if not the best. After a second watch, I realized how good it was and how much better than so many others.Good and quirky dialog, never a dull moment, well dosed action scenes with enough suspense and sense of danger. Great fun. The characters' motivations are always clear and believability never went below the expected minimum. Action scenes are very well filmed, efficient and never with the usual cheap fast cuts. The villain simply works because it's someone seemingly much more powerful, plus a treacherous man you just love to hate. And our protagonist has much-needed weaknesses: he's only human, and a bomb shrapnel close to his heart.The film looks and sounds great overall. Every character, including Jarvis, adds value and has an important function for the story and the entire casting is just sublime, with Downey's star shining the brightest. He even manages to make you care about a selfish billionaire playboy before he transcends himself.I can't put this film down. It still serves as a benchmark for all other Marvel productions that have come out since and none have achieved it's level, though some have come very close (Winter Soldier). But I guess there's truly nothing like a good origins story! After 8 years, this film is still as awesome as ever.",8,1,2,19 February 2017
Blade Runner," One to re-watch over and over...
","How this film has been underrated when it came out (mediocre, dull etc)!This is one of the very few films I like to re-watch from time to time. Ultimately this is not something I do for the story. Although I sometimes find new content here and there, things I missed the first time, the major reason to re-watch films like this is: -the astounding visuals (watch it in High Definition and be amazed, factor 10); -the music, I love Vangelis' unique soundtrack because he managed to make jazzy/bluesy synth music;-the atmosphere. Sure, it's all been done before, the film noir routine, but here it engages without being too formulaic. The philosophical themes are interesting too providing plenty of questions if you are interested. Mostly: what does it mean to be human? For instance, watch Rachel cry when she finds out she's not human after all. It evokes a form of pity, because, is she really that different from us? Isn't she worthy of a normal life? Aren't we all machines in a way, following the written routines in our own DNA code? Lack of empathy makes the replicants different from humans, but only for older models. And they get more human by the day. When they get too human they expire...the 4 year lifespan. But like any life form, they want survival. More even, to get the maximum out of the whole experience called life. Human after all?If you're not interested in such questions, this is still a beautiful film for the unequaled visuals, music, atmosphere and acting.I like the simple, original romantic ending, it's less ambiguous than the director's cut and I didn't mind the voice over at all. The director s cut has a completely different climax which is maybe less satisfying but stimulates much more thinking. Both versions endings are good and deserve recognition (particularly the original version has been bashed too much).The film is also better than the book though some would disagree. The book fails in truly capturing the atmosphere of a future where most living things are mechanical because it's one of Dick's less efficient books with a very forgettable ending. As much as I like his tales, his ideas usually outshine his writing. The film has much more atmosphere and tension.",9,7,11,3 November 2008
RED," Average and easy to forget
","This is just your average run-of-the mill action film: nothing new or too exciting. For a film about spies there is actually very little espionage and intelligence going on. For a movie that doesn't take itself seriously it is also disappointing not having one really good laugh. Your average episode of Chuck has 10 times as much humor as this whole movie.To make things worse, Mary-Louise Parker is extremely annoying. Willis and Freeman display nothing but routine. Malkovich is as painfully unfunny as the entire film.Still, I liked some action parts as well as seeing Helen Mirren with various automatic rifles. And the film is slightly better than the extremely poor The Expendables. It would be very OK to skip this one.",6,0,2,6 November 2010
Princess Mononoke," Not THE all-time best Anime
","I have seen plenty of Anime films and have mixed feelings about all of them. This one is no exception. Most Anime suffer from vague or erratic plots. Altho this film was actually relieving in that part, it still could have had a more tight plot because it was sometimes confusing, there were so many enemies the humans in the forest were fighting against. The animals, the forest spirit, the wolf girl, the demons, the other human tribe...a little bit more focus would have been nice. The movie is over 2 hours long, which is pretty exceptional for animated films, and in this case too long.Good about this anime was the a-typical hero who kept hoping for peace. Also, typically anime, no distinction between good or bad, just opposing forces who get in each others way. It's a good tale about the destructive force of hatred, in the form of leech-like demons. The animation is top-notch. Altho I'm not the biggest fan of the particular drawing style, it is original. No huge eyes or cheap, lazy animations here!I give it a 7,5/10",Null,1,2,2 May 2003
