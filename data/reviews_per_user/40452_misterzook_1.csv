Hereditary," Been a long time since I posted a review..
","This is a movie that I would not watch again. That does not mean that it is a bad movie. It is simply too painful to watch again. This movie is more of Psycholgical Suspense/Drama than horror. True it is somewhat horrific to watch. Be prepared, no spoilers needed. All of the cast are truly amazing.Toni Colette should have won an award for this movie.",9,1,2,2 July 2020
