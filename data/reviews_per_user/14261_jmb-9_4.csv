The Blair Witch Project," Possibly the best horror movie ever made; certainly the most intelligent.
","Movies can become integral to one's personal mythology. For example, looking at the curtain or door before closing your eyes in the shower (Psycho) or checking for sharks before swimming (Jaws), or, now, thinking twice before a peaceful stroll in the woods, at night. Anyone who sees Blair Witch will, I think, incorporate it into his/her understanding of dark, or isolation, or of fearful things. Movies like this stay with us (whether we want them to or not) forever.",10,3,6,3 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," The Poor Blair Witch
","The early IMDb ratings for Blair Witch and the user comments were all enthusiastic and genuine. Then the media came along. Artisan claimed credit for everything (the website was better when Ed did it. At least the pictures loaded and the hyperlinks worked, which is more than I can say now...) the actors jumped in, and Dan and Ed began to look like mindless opportunists. Comments from viewers now are surprisingly negative..Well, God never intended everyone to see a movie like Blair Witch, just as not everyone should see Clerks, or Z (lo, these many years ago) or Dark City. We all enjoy different things, and some people really would prefer to see Runaway Bride, or The Thomas Crown Affair, or The Haunting, or Inspector Gadget.So, if some people are disappointed after seeing Blair, perhaps the hype and buzz did overcome the really brilliant little indie film and in doing so made it seem more universal than it is. That is unfortunate. However, I recently read that Hollywood insiders feel that hype on the Internet made Blair a hit, and that is unjust and false.Blair Witch is archetypal. It is what frightens you when you are babysitting at a strange house, in the woods. It is why you understand expressions like 'things that go bump in the night.' The Blair Witch Project is brilliant. Say all you want about Artisan, or the Internet, or buzz and hype. Artisan didn't make Blair. Heather and Mike and Josh didn't either.Dan and Ed did. Congratulations on a job well done.",10,1,2,10 August 1999
Fight Club," A film that, by the end of the film, had me at the edge of my seat!
","I'm merely 16 years old.  That is manly why,according to the critics,this movie is highly rated by me. This movie is a kick-you-in-the-balls kind of movie that has a fast pace to it that I've never seen before.  Its integration of digital effects is noticeable but hard to point out which adds to the movie.  The dialogue is humorous and smooth, combined with really good 'fight' scenes,no pun intended,which make this movie a teen or young adult 'got to see' film.  My dad tagged along for the movie, and claimed that it sucked, but that was merely because he went to the bathroom at the most crucial point. So in closing....GO SEE THIS MOVIE, 'It will stand out in your head for at least week, as you try and wrap your head around what you saw.'",10,0,1,16 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," Great acting, startling ending to a really good ghost story.
","Without spoilers, I am not sure that you can guess the ending of this movie. Like The Usual Suspects, the final revelation is logical on a certain level, but still not predictable or expected. And, like The Usual Suspects, the ending forces a review of what new meanings and levels of meaning result from this unexpected twist. The relationships change, who is the savior/saved changes, and all of this results in a more complex and enjoyable movie experience. The acting is subtle and utterly believable. The movie belongs to Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, both of whom are riveting. I especially liked the final resolution and the acceptance on the part of the boy's character. You might have expected the nightmares to be vanquished, rather than understood.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
