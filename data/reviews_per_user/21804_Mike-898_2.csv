Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Good Movie
","The thing you must remember when watching this movie is that it is a family movie. Too many people I know went along expecting to see a big long script full of important speeches about life and so on. This a FAMILY movie. Too many people judge it on the script (or lack of), or the characterisation. It is mainly for the kids. So what if Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character ever, or Ewan McGregor does the sh*ttiest english accent, it doesn't matter. Kids like Jar Jar Binks, and don't care about Ewan McGregor's accent. When I first watched this movie, there were some younger kids in front of me and they were moaning about how boring it was. But as soon as Darth Maul came on and lit up his double sided lightsaber, they were so interested that by the end of the movie, they were on the edge of their seats. So don't judge it on the script or the acting, I mean, it does have some good things like Darth Maul and the fight scene. It ROCKS!!! Darth Maul really is a creepy dude. His facial expressions in the fight were hilarious. (They weren't bad, they just looked realistic. Like a rugby game in slow motion) Just remember, when you do see this movie, that it is a FAMILY movie.",Null,0,0,24 August 1999
Casino," Damn cool movie
","Once again Martin Scorsese, Nicholas Pileggi, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci unite for another epic mob movie, based on a true story. Casino tells the story of Sam Rothstein, who is put in charge of a mob controlled casino. Joe Pesci plays his friend, Nicky Santoro, from back home years ago who comes out to A) Protect Sam and the casino and B) make some cash for himself. He does just that. Along the way, Sam begins a relationship with Ginger, a hustler at the casino played by Sharon Stone. It tells the story of how the mob controlled casinos, and how people like these helped mess it up. From the opening scenes, one can see that Scorsese is following the Goodfellas format of flashback/voiceover work, but this benefits the movie. DeNiro and Pesci are on top form again, as is Sharon Stone surprisingly. Over all, a very well written, acted and directed film, the only drawback being it's length. Word of warning, this film is very violent at times. You would have heard of the vice scene by now as it helped garner this film some notorority, but it isn't the only one. If you can handle the violence and language, then this is a very rewarding film experience.Best scene: DeNiro busts some yokels trying to cheat at the casino, and proves that a hammer and a kind word work better than just a kind word.",10,1,1,14 July 2002
