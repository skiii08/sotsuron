The Longest Yard," The Longest Yard
","by Blake Nettles.The Longest Yard was a funny movie. It was also suspenseful. This movie was about an ex-quarterback going to jail for shaving points off of a football game. The prisoners try to get back at the guards by playing them in a football game. The suspenseful part was during the game. At half time the warden wanted Paul Crewe to lose the game for shorter time in prison.This was a great movie and it was also funny. The funniest part was when Paul Crewe got pulled over. He made jokes about the cops, ran from the cops, and while he was driving he stopped and wrecked the car.I think that the actors did a great job, that's why it was a great movie. It was one of the best movies I've seen lately.",10,1,4,22 October 2005
Lords of Dogtown," Lords of Dogtown
","by Chris Weseman.The story is about three boys making their way from poor to rich. The story is a true story (with a little Hollywood put in it) and has action, drama, romance, and some comedy. Both parents and kids would enjoy this movie. For the kids there was the action and skateboarding and for the parents and adults there's the soundtrack and the 70's vibe that they can relate to.Most of the action is the skateboarding, surfing, and fights that happened. The skateboard contests and the training have the most action. An example of the action is when they drain peoples' pools so they can skateboard and they have to run from the police.There is a lot of drama in the movie. Most of it is just about their lives, going from poor dogs to the 'Z-Boys'. The main drama is when they all go their separate ways (Tony and Stacy join different skate teams and Jay joins a street gang). I won't give away the ending but I will just say they find out what the boys really want.There is only a little bit of romance and comedy. The romance would have to be the couples and break ups. Stacy starts to date Tony's little sister, but he doesn't feel comfortable doing stuff with her in front of her brother and things start breaking apart for them. Then someone else comes in and he and Tony's sister start cheating on Stacy.The one bit of comedy I can think of is was when Tony got 'patty-slapped' by Skip at the fast food restaurant.It was a really good movie and I liked it a lot. I think most people would like it.",9,0,12,23 October 2005
Beauty and the Beast," Beauty and the Beast
","by Ashley Chewning.The movie The Beauty and The Beast is a heart-warming production by the Disney family. The movie was about Belle (Paige 0' Hara) who was trying to make a beast (Robby Benson) very lovable for him to change back with his friends: Lumiere (Jerry Orbach), Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansburg), Chip (Bradely Pierce), Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers, who is also the narrator for the movie), Wardrobe (Jo Anne Worley), Bergman or Babette (Mary Kay), and the stove (Brian Cummings). If the beast and his friends don't change back before the last rose petal falls, then they would stay like that forever.I thought that The Beauty and The Beast was a very good movie. I thought it was dramatic because there was a lot of fire that threatened the Beast and other people. There were many scenes that made the movie action-packed. For an example, at the end of the movie Gaston (Richard White) and the beast fought with each other at the top of the castle. I thought that was a cool thing to watch.The romantic part was the best part out of the whole movie. It all started at the dance in the middle of the ballroom floor. The song came on and they were dancing and having fun. Then it went to near the end of the movie when the Beast and his friends turn back to normal, and Belle and the Beast live happily ever after.I think that this movie would be good to watch with a family member or with your best friends.",10,5,5,18 October 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Million Dollar Baby
","by Morgan Young.In this movie that features award winners, Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman, you are taught a lesson: never let anyone stop you from fulfilling your dream. Scrap (Morgan Freeman) was a retired fighter. He cleaned Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood) gym, and he always saw the good in everyone. Scrap was the one who saw something in Maggie (Hilary Swank) way before Frankie did.Maggie was a small town girl from southwestern Missouri. She grew up knowing that she would never amount to anything more than trash. All she wanted was someone to believe in her. Even without the approval of her family and others around her Maggie never let go of her dream of being a big time boxer. She always kept her unshakable focus.Frankie hated taking risks and never allowed himself to get close to anybody. That all changed, however, when he met Maggie. He took a chance and agreed to train her, not knowing that she would win him over. They would both face 'a battle that would demand their hearts and courage' stated by Scrap. They grew to have a strong friendship and found a sense of family in each other that both had lost a long time ago.As you follow the journey of Maggie and Frankie you will not only grow to cherish their friendship, you will see that the real magic in boxing is 'fighting battles beyond endurance and risking everything for a dream that no one sees but you'! No matter what, always remember the one key rule: 'Always protect yourself.' You will learn what happens if you don't, but only if you go see Million Dollar Baby!",10,1,2,22 October 2005
Aladdin," Aladdin
","by Alise BeverlyThe movie that I am reviewing is Aladdin. Aladdin is a Walt Disney production. It in general is usually classified as a movie for children. In this movie there are a lot of main characters. Aladdin, Jasmine, and their friends. The story line goes something like this: There was once a poor man who lived off of stealing bread and finding a place to sleep each night. He dreams of living in a palace and having the things that he doesn't have. This character is Aladdin. On the other hand there is a princess who wishes she was normal and could leave the palace walls to be treated like an everyday person. So she does. She sneaks out of the palace one day and bumps into Aladdin on the streets. Neither one of them know each other's identity, but they finally find out. Through a lot of hard times throughout the movie they finally meet again and fall in love.And who is to blame for them meeting up again? The Genie, of course! Aladdin finds a genie in a bottle that can grant him his every wish. One of which is to cast the evil Jaffar out of the palace and into a genie bottle so he cannot take over and marry Jasmine. She is not in love with him; she is in love with Aladdin. And so the story goes. To find out all of the adventurous details in this movie, go rent it, or buy it. Trust me it will not be a waste of your money!! :)My opinion of this movie is that it is a GREAT movie for any age! It is exciting and fun to watch. This movie will keep you going and on your toes to see what will happen next. It also has a small love story plot to it, too. Now, of course, fairy tales aren't true. But if they were this is the just the sweetest thing ever! A magic carpet ride, being a princess and meeting that special someone just by coincidence. This is a great movie that I have enjoyed my entire life and I know you will enjoy it just as much as I have.",10,1,1,22 October 2005
