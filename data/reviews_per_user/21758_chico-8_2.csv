Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not disappointed
","Like many others i was at a midnight showing of the phantom menace. I have to say that while this is not the greatest epic of all time, it was still well worth the wait and the hype. Some of the movie was childish, but then star wars isn't much more than a mature fairy tale. The truly hard core fans may not like the movie and may call it a poor attempt at capturing the magic of the 4th, 5th, and 6th films, but try taking off the nostalgia colored glasses. It's not gone with the wind, but it does a great job of setting up episodes 2 and 3. And if you're reading this Mr. Lucas, kill jar-jar in episode 2, I'll pay just to see that.",8,0,0,25 May 1999
Titanic," Better than expected, but..
","I'll admit, It was hard to have no expectations for titanic. 11 Oscars, and of course the hype would lead you to believe that this is the greatest movie of all time. While the movie was very good, it is far from the greatest of all time. The visual effects are outstanding, but the dialouge and several errors detract from the overall story. (The movie ignores the ship 'Californian', which was less than 20 miles away) The love story , while touching, could have been lifted striaght out of 'Alladin.' More than worth your time for the effects alone, but suffers somewhat due James Cameron's script and editing choices.",Null,1,2,17 April 1999
