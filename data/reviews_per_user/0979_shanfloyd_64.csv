Mission: Impossible III," Better than M:I-2
","I don't know if this film can mark the revival of the series but this is definitely a positive turn from much-hyped trash by John Woo. While Woo focused unnecessarily on visually stylized boring action sequences without any pace in the story (well, if that's a story at all), M:I-3 rightfully portrays a simpler yet entertaining basic storyline, carefully added subplots, optimum and balanced visual effects for the action scenes all of which are quite helped by decent casting choices like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Maggie Q and to some extent Michelle Monaghan. Keri Russell is surprisingly very under-used.Well, agent Ethan Hunt has fallen in love with a doctor and got married. Now he got an assignment to rescue a fellow agent (who's also his protégé) from a mission. Then he got much intertwined in the process which ended up with the bad guys kidnapping his wife as a hostage. And that's the maximum I can reveal under a 'no spoiler' banner. There's two major plot twists after that which made the story decent enough.I reached to a point in watching action films where nothing except very intelligent ones excite me enough to be marked as a great film. So M:I-3 is not a great film. But it's good enough for the original M:I fans. My expectations were, frankly, quite minimal. But I ended up entertained enough. Some of the scenes truly deserve praise.",6,1,1,18 May 2006
Catch Me If You Can," Brilliant acts in a somewhat jaded perspective of Spielberg.
","In these days of breath-taking special effects, dazzling sounds and tension-filled interpretation of violent thrill, it's quite hard for a director like Spielberg to check the interest to make uses of them in his movie while he has a number of award-winning films filled with all of them under his belt. But it evidently appeared, after watching the film, that he really wanted to do something new. Something that deliberately will not be considered as a typical Spielberg film.But he has not quite succeeded to fulfill those wishes. Though he has not used anything special of modern technology, apart from excellent camera work, another typical Spielberg perspective is now exposed which he could not remove from this film too. Well, upto this time that was playfully hidden by the tension his movie used to have. But now, the 'cat and mouse' theory, in which the mouse is always the public winner (look at the examples, Jon Anderton, Ian Malcolm et al, the arachnophobics, the family in Poultergeist etc) is at its over-used bluntness while now, the 'cat' has come into the standard of FBI agents. But above all these, it must be said that Spielberg is quite lucky to have so much brilliant actors at their best in this film. Be it DiCaprio, who is all convincing as young and handsome Frank Abagnale Jr. or Tom Hanks as the FBI agent. Both, especially Hanks, got it all right in every places in the movie. And we must not forget Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. His performance is also quite realistic and fluent. So it turns out to be the acting which prompts us to see the movie over and over again, this time not by Spielberg, though smelling something new in the future air.",9,1,2,7 March 2003
The Ring," A finely shot serious storyline
","If we divide the history of horror films chronologically into three eras, we'll find that each of them has their own style of stories. Don't include low-budget B-movies here; they're all the same over the years. Now, films prior to the 70's were, in most cases, derived from old classics. Or, the stories were set in old times in old haunted castles. Films within 70's and 80's are mostly made up of gory violence, bloody horrifying spirits roaming around a quiet town or some deserted place at night and attacking young girls in candid conditions. Films after the 90's generally has a queer storyline and lots of visual and sound effects do the rest job, plus or minus violence. This is the general rule.... but of course, with lot of exceptions.'The Ring', a remake of the Japanese film 'Ringu', falls in the last category and it, I must say, satisfied the conditions loosely. Well it has a queer storyline, good sound and visual effects, some instant chillers but the most important thing is, it has a fine seriousness over the story that is somehow scarce among the other modern horror films. The film never let the story get loose in any place. Though the plot is basically bogus, but the presentation of this plot is so fantastic and so realistic that when you are watching the film you are bound to take it seriously. That's where the success of this film lies.The content of the tape on which the story stands is brilliantly shot and presented... I must say. It is not really horrifying but artistic if you don't consider the fate of the viewers. Naomi Watts in her first leading role seemed very well. Dorfman as her son rather acted well but it seemed to me that his character is quite influenced by Haley Joel Osment in 'The 6th sense' which was not a feature of 'Ringu'. However, locations of shooting were very well chosen.This film probably is one of the best in its genre and era. But the ending is too much overrated. There lies a little mess. Otherwise it is highly recommended. 4/5.",8,0,0,13 February 2003
Finding Neverland," The beauty in it all.
","So when the screen went white with a small black 'The End' written subtly in the middle, I felt the tear which tried four times in the past one-and half hours to roll on my cheek, finally did so. But I didn't feel what it was for: grief, joy or nostalgia. Whatever it is, 'Finding Neverland' touched me like no other movie I saw this year did. And I don't think I know why. One cannot attribute this responsibility to any single aspect of a film like excellent acting by the whole cast, wonderfully written screenplay, magnificent set designs or brilliant cinematography to make Barrie's visions come alive. A movie such as this simply has to excel in everything to build such a strong emotional framework in the audience's mind. If any one is to give credit, the closest person is then director Marc Forster.Today, when showing young-age imagination on movie screen inevitably means large bouts of special computerized visual and sound effects, it is a relief to see Forster depended primarily on detailed set designs and camera-work to achieve that. I don't know, but that seems paying actual homage to James Barrie himself. And what a treat that was. Every time the sets abruptly changed to make us see through Barrie's vision, when he played with the children or when he pictures Neverland to himself or to Sylvia, what I admired is Forster's vision. Just see this: when Barrie was playing the pirate scene with the kids in his cottage garden, it's all the ship, the rain, the artificially-made water etc on his (as well as ours) eyes, but every time Peter utters an out-of-place word, the scenes changed back to the cottage garden. Oh, how I liked that part. And when Barrie sees the children fly out through the window when they were jumping on their bed, that was perhaps the most beautiful scene in the movie.If the credits for the visions of Mr. Barrie goes to Forster, that for the attitude certainly goes to Johnny Depp. Depp once again proves he is one of the few finest actors in Hollywood today. It's just unfortunate for him that he faces tough challenge every time he gets nominated for the Academy Award. Depp's J.M. Barrie comes with a calm, reserved yet strikingly warm and caring personality. And Depp managed that Scottish accent extremely well. And how nicely he fits into every character Barrie himself plays in his sessions with the kids. And he belts out some memorable quotes like no one else could have done... 'Just a dog?' or 'See? The boy is gone.' for example and if you've seen the movie you'll know what I'm talking about. It is by far the best performance he has ever done, keeping in mind 'Pirates of the Caribbean' or 'Donnie Brasco'.And definitely, it is the best Kate Winslet I've ever seen too. I haven't seen 'Eternal Sunshine...' but Kate as Sylvia is much more masterful than even Kate as Iris Murdoch. She is one of the rare actresses with a physical beauty that really makes such roles possible now-a-days. And how glorious she looks in a simple early twentieth century outfit. Her portrayal of Sylvia is flawless in every aspect of the character: joy, grief, contempt or sufferance as a patient. Watch her when she asks 'What's it like?' despite of her grief for her dead husband and her chest pain when Barrie tells her about Neverland.But it'd all be wrong if there were not Dustin Hoffman, Julie Christie and Radha Mitchell for the supporting roles. Hoffman plays Barrie's producer with immense personality. He is intimidating, but never harsh. He is a realist, yet he believes in talent. And he is never egotistic. These traits suited Hoffman nicely. For Mitchell, hers was not the best, but she manages to do what she was supposed to do. But Julie Christie's performance is a real surprise for the film. I'd like to see more of her in such character roles.All the kids did a great job. It's not feasible to point out little mistakes in their acting but I think it would be a little better if the eldest boy, George could be played with a bit more emotion. But let's forget that. As long as we got this level of mastery in acting, directing and script-writing ('He is the real Peter Pan') I think I'd leave this review utterly without any kind of negative remark. Once again, it is a movie to watch in every kind of mental condition and definitely needs a second viewing. As someone else pointed out, if I see one movie this year let it be that.",10,6,7,19 April 2005
Monster," Brilliant acting... yet a disturbing movie.
","Aileen Wuornos was an obnoxious character. A highway prostitute by profession, she was ugly and foul-mouthed. She is considered to be the first female serial killer in the US. In this movie one of the most beautiful women in the world, Charlize Theron played this character and how. Hers is perhaps the most powerful acting performance by an actress I have ever seen (Hilary Swank in 'Boys don't cry' comes close). The make-up effect was extra-ordinary. How can one not mention those eyebrow-less large eyes and that flabby pimpled face, totally different from Charlize's own? And she just defined the character. She put on weight, brought out that small-town accent, that careless gait. Her Oscar win was totally obvious, now I see. And the other female character, Aileen's teenage lesbian friend Selby, was also totally awesome. This is Christina Ricci's best too. She perhaps deserved a nomination.Apart from acting, the movie is disturbing. I beg to differ from the common opinion. I think the movie is not brilliantly made. I've seen enough movies with disturbing and controversial basic theme but many of them are so superbly made that watching them never becomes tiresome. Here I got bored in the middle. Had it been not Charlize Theron, I would have probably change the channel. All the tortures on Aileen or all the murder scenes somehow lack art. This is not a movie I would watch a second time. Only because of acting and its superior screenplay I'd give it 4/5.",7,1,2,1 March 2005
Alien: Resurrection," Definitely lacks the brilliance of the first two films... but still entertaining.
","The fourth installment of the coveted Alien series more resembles Cameron's 'Aliens' in its basic structure to be primarily an action movie, lacking the suspense horror atmosphere of Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. The producers and screenwriters found a believable way to bring back Ellen Ripley once again to kick the alien butts. And they've got a good supporting cast of Ron Perlman, Winona Ryder (in a somewhat unusual role), Dan Hedaya and others.Although the film follows a storyline that somehow resembles 'Alien', which is good since Alien 3's complex story was a reason of its failure, 'Resurrection' remained a mediocre film mostly due to lack of twists in the plot and cheesy dialogues. The story is too much linear and the only plot twist involving the character Call was not directly related to the story. Yet the whole alien/human hybrid concept was entertaining enough and the bits of action were made well enough to watch. I feel the film did not aspire to be a cinematic classic like Alien or Aliens, but it did well enough to keep the saga alive after the disappointing Alien 3. It should be well enjoyed by the series fans.",7,2,3,9 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Preserves the mood and even excels at some points.
","This time I did expect a lot from a sequel and for the first time in my recent memory I am totally satisfied and adequately entertained. Come on, 'Dead Man's Chest' starts off with the same mood and pace the first film left us with. But this film is far more complex in order to deliver something new.First of all, it is just insanely hilarious. Really I didn't expect so much bout of comedy. Yes, a few of the funny scenes are rather forced but the rest are just brilliant... and this comedy mood stayed throughout the film even when suspense and action were full on. Second, the new characters... be it the crew of Jack Sparrow or Davy Jones and his men... are extremely well-designed and well-written. For the actors, Depp's acting this time looked rather forced sometimes as he was trying hard to achieve his Oscar-nominated standard of the character. But face it, in the first film Jack was something unique, here we already know his character and his antics, manner of speech etc. So I think ultimately Depp did a nice job. Keira Knightley has got a more wide and complex role this time but she does little besides delivering her beautiful bullet-like English accent. She falters often with careful emotional sequences. Bloom also hasn't much improved from his previous portrayal of Will Turner.Bill Nighy portrays the infamous Davy Jones with much style. And the make-up and visual effects regarding him and his crew are really worth every praise. The overall special visual and sound effects are top-notch, as expected. Verbinski took special care building the sets and location, as evident by the excellent outdoor scenery and entirely believable and captivating indoor atmospheres like the bars, the dungeons and the tribal area in the river at night.The film has enough amount of action, perhaps too much at some places with the underwater monster. It ends in a rather interesting manner, making you crave for the part 3 to come out. I really enjoyed the ending and its various implications or predictions. To summarize, 'Dead Man's Chest' is definitely one of the best summer blockbusters in a long time.",8,17,28,25 July 2006
The English Patient," A thought-provoking story... rich in performances.
","The director Anthony Minghella must have had some immense passion for the original story, otherwise I believe he could not let this film grow such slowly emphasizing on every relevant detail. To wrap up the premise, it is definitely a love story, but it is much much more. The film features two stories of love... one is Count Almasy's passionate affair with his colleague's wife Katharine, shown in flashback; and the other, set in the story's present, is between Kip the Sikh bomb disposal expert and Hana the French-Canadian nurse who took care of Almasy after a deadly injury in WWII. While the central story revolves around Almasy's painful memories, it also contrasts his and Hana's experiences with love with a haunting style.The character of Almasy gives a golden chance to any actor. His plane got shot down in the Sahara and he was taken to Italy severely burnt, injured, and crippled, with an acute memory loss. He was put to an abandoned house with Hana to take care of him. As Hana read some part from the book he possessed, his memories kept coming back to him... memories of a passionate yet futile relationship. And yet he was surely going to die, his only motivation to live was to get the memory of the that love's fate back. Ralph Fiennes gives perhaps his career-best performance as Almasy. He portrays Almasy as a glum yet romantic man who himself never thought his capability to love someone could be so deep. His take on the burnt-faced, crippled Almasy is equally fascinating. He certainly deserved his Academy nomination.Hana is an extremely good natured woman, yet her own experiences with love had been also painful until she meets the Army bomb expert Kip Singh (played excellently by Naveen Andrews). She gets fascinated by his original romanticism and subsequently worries if he will also face the same fate as her previous lovers. Her relationship to Almasy is nothing extraordinary as such, but there remained a bond between them, formed by their choices and nature of love. Juliette Binoché won Oscar for this role and that sums up how she acted. She portrays Hana as one who's optimistic in the outside but bears a strange frustration and pain about love deep inside. Two contrasting scenes: one, when she plays at the yard in the evening and two, when she rides the bicycle up to the bridge to see if Kip's alright.All the other actors were also great. Willem Dafoe gives a very realistic performance as the Canadian war victim with a hidden agenda. Kristin Scott Thomas perhaps, in my opinion, was not the best choice for the role of Katharine but what she did was magical. Colin Firth was also nice to watch as her husband.As a director Minghella is definitely breathtaking. Instead of discussing his style, I would only mention some scenes from the movie which remained unforgettable. One, the sandstorm; two, the scene where Almasy first courts Katharine; three, the first verbal exchange between Almasy and Caravaggio; four, where Kip shows Hana the paintings at the church... I see I can go on and on. Minghella also brings out a magnificent screenplay with some memorable quotes.The English Patient is a movie rich with every ingredient a serious film should have -- cinematography, original music, make-up, good script and of course, acting. Although it may seem a bit slow it is not boring, rather this slowness is one of its gifts.",9,5,8,6 September 2005
The Girl Next Door," One of the most enjoying teen comedies...
","Saying that, the film should not exactly be confined into the name of 'teen flick'. Thanks to Greenfield's excellent handling with the characters and the innovative smart script, the film explores a lot into character development. The characters are not at all stereotypical as expected in such films. Gradual changes that came into them were finely portrayed by the actors too, especially Emile Hirsch. Another accomplishment for the film is that it was able to produce some 'sweet grace' in its romantic atmosphere. Simply, I considered the film multi-dimensional. Clearly the film wasn't intended to be marketed that way.Considering the plot and the storyline, I admit there had to be some clichés. It was never Greenfield's intention to make an art film with this plot after all. But he handles sex and nudity in brilliant mastery to make it suitable for teenagers. The basic story may be inspired by 'Risky Business' but there were touches of Greenfield's innovative thinking and smart plot twists everywhere.And Elisha Cuthbert has everything the viewers' masculine urges can possibly wish for. Besides giving us the best visual treat possible under a no-nudity contract, she also gives a nice performance. Keeping in mind her talent, the screenwriters could explore her character a bit more in my opinion, like her background. Yet she makes it sure that people who like this film would follow her career quite earnestly afterwards.",8,4,5,17 October 2005
Constantine," Mindless crap of action and gore.
","With due respect, watching this film in theatre for nearly two hours is kinda torture to the mind and eyes. I'm not a fan of the comic book, in fact I never read them; I only saw the movie for Keanu Reeves since he is one my favorite actors. And to tell the truth, it is the most intolerable Keanu film after 'Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey'. It's not that he acted badly here, he tried his best to play a character who is nothing like him (a patient of chronic pulmonary emphysema all well-built and handsome?), it's just that the film is so baseless and crazy and monotonous and filled with unnecessary gore and unrelated action sequences, the overall effect is unsatisfactory. And the ending? so cheap and mindless. It's a relief after all that there's no romantic interest between Constantine and Angela.I know I'm not supposed to criticize the original comic book which the movie is based upon, but it can't be avoided. Why is Keanu wasting himself being in such B-grade movies? This role loosely resembles his role in the Matrix trilogy-- savior of mankind, that white shirt and black suit, the haircut, the accent... all the same. And for Rachel Weisz, she is brilliant in this film. But that's not the point. It's not good to see these two fairly good actors of our time in these kind of mindless action/horror junk. We like to see them in quality films, not always drama, romance etc but in all genres.Points to see this movie:- Good special effects, fairly good acting throughout, nice background music etc. Let's not discuss the points that are not in favor of it. They are plenty!",5,4,8,26 March 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," A visual treat... nothing else.
","Movies like 'The Day After Tomorrow' always have certain goals to fulfill. There are few films that set goals in every strata of cinema and fulfill them. Films like 'Day after Tomorrow' do not set goals in all strata, the primary objective of them is to provide the cinema-goers the maximum visual treat. All others are just to hold up a story to make it into a film. So this film is filled with unscientific plot, childish story lines, cheap clichés and laughable script. I wouldn't be surprised if it had worse acting performances. They were lucky to get decent actors like Quaid, Gylenhaal or Rossum.What I mean to say is, watching this film in a big screen theatre with good sound is indeed a treat. There are a number of scenes where the audience applauded heartily. Once again, one can't help praising the marvel of modern computerized special effects after this film. That was the film's primary objective and it passed that exam with distinction.",6,1,2,15 October 2005
Spider-Man 3," Good enough... but tangled up too much.
","Oh how we love those summer blockbusters... it's true we expect too much from them, especially when they're sequels to really quality films. And it's also true we pounce to criticize them with harsh cruelty when they fail to meet our expectations. 'Spiderman 3' is a perfect summer blockbuster at its own credit. But it has got two wonderful movies as its prequels... so, it faces a tough challenge.Three villains... one of them my favorite - Venom. Where the movie really fails is its attempts to show the backgrounds of all three of them. OK, the goblin needs no background. But Venom gets the least screen time and I'm not satisfied. A good villain needs time to grow... See, all of the major Spidey villains have their brighter pasts from where they slowly transform to villains. In this film this transformation is hurried and shown abruptly, which quite kills the movie's mood. I believe the film wastes more time on Sandman than it needed.Another major aspect of the film is Peter Parker's alter ego as the black spiderman after he's infected by the symbiote. I loved the sequence in the jazz club for sure, but I also think the character is shown overtly egomaniacal and unnecessarily irritating. Maguire tries hard to create the contrast between the real Peter and the infected Peter and thus in both cases, he over-acted. Along with his acting, several scenes are also written with excessive emotions and often they are laughable.But, there are also numerous bright points in the film of course. I just loved the use of humor in this film... especially in scenes involving JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell. And the special visual and sound effects are awesome, you know, as they should be. The fighting sequences, though not very innovative, but always fun to watch. The overall acting is not bad... with James Franco and Topher Grace both stealing the show.So, to wrap it up, one would definitely enjoy the film. But every time I think about Spidey2, I compare them... and this one somehow loses.",7,9,18,5 May 2007
The Prestige," Really dark and twisted...
","Christopher Nolan's latest offering from his brother's story is not only a dark and thrilling adventure filled with mysterious plot twists but also a brilliant character study. The two leading characters are written wonderfully and their style of never-ending rivalry was really a pleasure to watch. Their contrasting style as magicians, their markedly different points of view were really designed well. It was an interesting take on how success changed their lives in two different manners.Like the characters they play, the two leading actors also constantly kept on trying to outshine each other. Jackman pulls off a very convincing and controlled performance as Angier, the perfect entertainer. But I must say it's Christian Bale who steals the show as the mysterious Alfred who never lets out a secret until it's time. His character has so many dimensions and his performance is just utterly flawless. You can see mystery in his eyes and smell it in his words.Among the other actors, Michael Caine again delivers a purely professional supporting role. Scarlett Johansson as Olivia is somewhat one-dimensional and she did not receive the best dialogues too. It was fun to watch David Bowie as Nicola Tesla. I think he does a fair job to this sort of off-beat character.Nolan's direction is the major thing which makes this film tick. He spreads the story into several non-linear segments and although it might seem confusing to the audience to follow the plot in this different time-period segments, it successfully enhances the atmosphere of mystery. The plot twists are never rushed and each takes its own time to grow. Although I didn't like the absurd basic idea behind the true explanation of 'transported man'... still the ending is excellently executed.May the Nolans keep this quality up.",8,3,5,6 April 2007
The Terminator," Seeing the film in today's point of view...
","Commenting on this film after watching Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was not easy. I've seen it for seven or eight times before this. So when I sat before my TV to watch it again, just a day after I saw T3 in theatre, it gave me a new idea. That the Terminator (1984) never meant to be a sci-fi eye candy based on raw action, which T2 and more precisely T3 have become. It should be classified into some sci-fi horror to be more perfect. That creepy Terminator model, that gory look of Schwarzenegger, the night based story and especially that background music--- all meant to create a feeling of horror or dark thriller, never a die-hard action flick. I don't know if seeing this film in the perspective of that era, early 80's, could tell a different thing. But to be an action movie in today's eyes, Terminator is not sufficient.Years before The Matrix presented us the very idea that in near future machines or self-aware computer programs will enslave the human race, there came this thing... SkyNet. Perhaps to deal with this concept was not Cameron's primary goal in this rather low budget superhit. His intention was to make another cult film. Success was much higher than expected, it's true. But that is not my point. I just mean if Terminator was made in late 90's, not back in '84, it would have been a much more different movie. Inevitably the major focus had to be on the basic concept, not Arnold building his muscles in the rooftop. I realise in sudden horror that it might not cast Arnold as well... since a killing machine doesn't have to be a Mr. Universe in figure. And in today's eyes, it would surely be an absurd idea too to an indie filmmaker.Whether Terminator would succeed if made now as much as it did back then is a different story. All that is important is its effect on filmmakers thereafter. It was a flawed film, true. But it created a genre of its own. It was highly extraordinary, even in the eyes of present-day post-Matrix viewers. That skin-on-one-side look of Arnie's face became a trademark; his 'I'll be back' became a legend. This film generated several inspired works but few equals. I know exactly why T2 is a different movie at all. Terminator is a classic of its own kind.",8,0,1,2 August 2003
Hotel Rwanda," I cannot write a review.
","When the subject matter of a film moves you so much, gets to your veins and haunts your thoughts even after a day of watching it, you cannot possibly discuss its quality of acting, directing, screenplay, cinematography, editing or like that. You cannot write a critical review of this film, in plain words.When I went into the theatre I partially regretted the fact that I hadn't done necessary research on the political issue of Rwanda the film is based on. I don't see the importance any more. Now I don't care about Hutus or Tutsis or what really happened in 1994, I only know that this is all about the blind hatred between two racially/religiously/culturally different groups of people. I live in a country which is not exactly alien to such conditions. In fact while watching the film I couldn't help remembering the Gujarat massacre and riots that happened in 2002. I am not comparing the two incidents, it is just my way to personally relate to this film.I left the theatre with another thought. Whom do we call a hero? I thank Terry George, Don Cheadle and others for making a film on a true real-life hero, a breed which humanity is always struggling to produce. Paul Rusesabagina is a hero, perhaps more than Oscar Schindler who had always another choice and more favorable position that Paul. He is a hero that even you and I could turn out to be in necessary circumstances. Don Cheadle is magical, but perhaps that's my half-dead movie-reviewer self talking.Perhaps someday I'll delete this comment and write something more informative and complete. Before that I have to get over the experience that I actually saw this film, saw its subtle yet shocking depictions of horrible reality. It's not an experience to remember. Its an experience of learning how to produce and face reality.",10,1,3,29 April 2006
Ocean's Twelve," Messed up in storyline.
","Like everyone else, I rented 'Ocean's Twelve' with high anticipation after watching 'eleven'. It would be rude to say that my hope is totally crushed or I thought this film is total crap, but certainly in terms of story and screenplay, it comes nowhere near its prequel. The story is too much complex from beginning to end as if the writer had too many things in his mind but never quite used them properly. I asked myself 'What's going on?' a number of times during the film but didn't get a satisfactory answer in the end.Still, the film has the original's stylish film-making, with innovative and interesting camera angles. It has got more star-studded cast including an enjoyable cameo by Bruce Willis as himself. The new starring role by Catherine Zeta-Jones is definitely one of the reasons one should however watch the film. Her looks, attitude and very comfortable performance are this film's valuable assets. But to tell the truth, when you've got a completely messed up story such as this, stars cannot save you.",6,0,0,18 December 2005
Taxi Driver," Classic.
","It's hard to judge a movie properly when you know from the beginning that this is one of Hollywood's greatest films ever made. You start to watch it with sky-high expectations and supreme confidence that you didn't waste your money on buying this DVD. 'Taxi Driver' actually is that kind of movie which lives up-to such expectations. It's based on a wonderful story of a lonely cab driver who is virtually alienated from society, but with psychotic aspirations to be somebody. But his motivations for life were not in full bloom until he met a child prostitute and got determined to rescue her. Robert DeNiro is at his very best as the title character, Travis. His mental transformations throughout the film is brilliantly portrayed by DeNiro. Young Jodie Foster is also excellent as the 14-year-old Iris. In a short screen time she nicely managed to show her talent. The rest of the supporting cast are quite good, too, especially Harvey Keitel.But only good casting does not make a good film. This film is a classic because it's every part is classic. Take screenplay, and it is one of the smartest ever written, with some legendary quotes like: 'You talking' to me?' or 'I know, you're a narc.' Take cinematography, and hell, how can you forget the violent scene after the final showdown, or the scene that reveals Travis' Mohican haircut? Take background music or the score, played primarily on Saxophone, it vividly expresses a feeling of utter loneliness throughout the film. And for Scorsese, I just don't know what to say. I have to search for the guy who got the best director Oscar that year. It's a shame.",10,0,0,25 April 2005
Lost in Translation," A beautiful and subtle film about alienation.
","I, along with those who didn't like the film, found the movie boring. I also found it beautiful. That's because the theme of this movie is boredom. And that's clearly evident within the first fifteen minutes when the camera, the background music and the script depict the two lead characters' boredom with such a detailed illustration, such a deep passion. The beautiful solitary shots (like the one with Bob playing golf in his room) that presents the characters' sense of alienation in a foreign society are the assets of the film. The little things they did together, or the little talks they had are ultimately nothing in the busy everyday life one normally leads; but in their times of loneliness they were like heaven. And if you, the viewer, connect yourself to their boredom, you'll feel that too.This movie is also an example of how an excellent script can take the best out of the actors. See for Bill Murray, he's definitely not one of the best actors in this planet however good he is. But here he delivers a performance that would make any one those best actors quite proud. His subtle withdrawed nature with a sense of fine humor is excellent. Two particular moments: One is when he does the Roger Moore thing and the other is when he speaks to Charlotte about having kids. So contrasting moments, yet so fit together. For Scarlett Johansson, I've seen five of her films and after seeing this one I must admit this performance is of another level. Her character is intelligent and fun-loving, and she discovers something new in this world but she doesn't know how to deal with it. Johansson is flawless in that mood. Their chemistry is the film's another asset. They both come to realize that their relationship has no future, yet they want to utilize their unique bond every minute they stay together. The screenplay gives their deserved treatment (for example, when Bob confesses he doesn't want to go, Charlotte replies, 'So don't. Stay here with me and we'll form a jazz band.').Another interesting aspect of the film is how it describes Japan and the people. The flood of color and sound that represents the technologically advanced city of Tokyo and its fun-loving people are sometimes fruitfully contrasted with the solemn and peaceful atmosphere of the monastery that Charlotte visited. But Bob and Charlotte couldn't blend into any of them and it's nobody's fault. And sometimes their misadventures are quite hilarious, like the scene with Bob, the first ad director and the interpreter Ms. Kawasaki. All the Japanese actors in the film do not have much prior acting experience I believe, but they fit in excellently.Now I must finish my comment mentioning Sofia Coppola's name, because she is the true person behind this movie. As you see all the praises I've done regarding this film, all are her own brilliant work.",9,18,35,22 August 2005
The Bourne Ultimatum," High adrenaline action trip
","Being an ardent fan of the Bourne movies, my suspense was all built up before I sat down to watch this third installment. This is the film where all questions regarding Bourne's past are supposed to be answered. The screenwriters crafted a story compelling enough to keep the viewer occupied before coming down to where Bourne started. Director Paul Greengrass, like 'Supremacy', again shows that he knows his job of directing an out-and-out action film very well. Although I'd comment that his trademark shaky hand-held camera technique is quite over-used here.I don't think all action sequences required that.Matt Damon is once again his composed and physically super-fit Jason Bourne persona. Among the other actors David Strathairn steals the show as the CIA project chief Vosen. The role of Nicky Parsons is extended in this film and Julia Stiles does a good job at it.The action sequences are phenomenal. What makes Bourne films tick is that they attempt to use more modern and different action styles other than simply car explosions, gunfights or chase sequences. The scene where Bourne runs through successive buildings and rooftops in Tangiers is just breathtaking. The use of Keysi fighting methods in the close combat sequences are impressive. Team these up with Greengrass' hand-held camera and sharp film editing and you get Bourne's adrenaline rush.Read here in IMDb that they're making a fourth Bourne film. Now that Bourne knows his identity it would be difficult to find a suitable storyline as compelling as these were. But lets hope...",8,0,1,1 December 2008
The Aviator," Exceptionally acted... but not Scorsese's best.
","'The Aviator' is an unusual film in the sense that it features the life of an unusual man. Howard Hughes, a pioneer in the history of aviation and cinema, two completely different fields. It is good that the movie showed enough of his contribution in the history of the former, as the name suggested. A movie meant as a biopic becomes an eye-candy the credit for which should not only go to the filmmakers but also the character Howard Hughes himself. Smart-looking planes, beautiful actresses of that time and also that plane crash in Beverly Hills sequence... all because of him. And it becomes perfect for a moviegoer when such a good plot comes with good acting.It is indeed quite a treat to see all the good actors performing so well altogether. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply awesome. At first it appeared to me he is somehow miscast as Howard Hughes, perhaps because he doesn't just look like him. But his acting was so wonderful that I can't think of anyone right now that could replace him. He definitely deserves his Oscar this time. The changes of Hughes' character with time is brilliantly portrayed, with some scenes where Leonardo proves his mastery like the days inside the hotel room or the last shot of Senate hearing or 'Show me all the blueprints'. Apart from him, 'The Aviator' is also Cate Blanchett's best work. Her appearance was perfect for Katharine Hepburn and she got the accent big time. She just defeated her works in 'Veronica Guerine' or 'Elizabeth'. John Reilly is good as always, so was Kate Beckinsale. I actually would love to see Scarlett Johansson as Ava Gardner but Kate is okay. Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda, however, are not upto that level. And oh yes, as long as we're speaking about acting, let's not forget the brilliant cameo by Jude Law as Eroll Flynn.The point is, all these decent performances by the actors could not make it the best film of the year. 'Aviator' has got a number of problems. The movie is nearly three hours long and it loses track in the middle. The first hour of the movie is very good and interconnected. But after that it just became a collection of separate events glued together. 'Aviator' was never meant to be a documentary film with actors. But that's what it became in the end. Personally I think the film aspect of Hughes' life should have been shown more, along with the aviation aspect of course. Sometimes it appeared filled with too much detailing and unnecessary shots like the opening scene or that scene of urinating in the bottles etc. As a director, Scorsese could not surpass his earlier works like 'Raging Bull' or 'Taxi Driver' or even 'Gangs of New York' with this one. Interesting and unexpected plot twists or showing violence in a simple careless manner, what were his trademark, are absent here. As he didn't get his Oscar from the said three films, I highly doubt he will make it this time. On the other hand, Eastwood has done a hell of a work with 'Million Dollar Baby'.My rating: 8/10",8,6,10,30 January 2005
The Killing Fields," Joffe's best work to date
","Based on the Khmer Rouge revolution in Cambodia, this is an excellent tale of hardship and friendship. Basically director Roland Joffe` did an wonderful job in exposing the detailed facts so simply in the film that you believe that you are in that time in person. The two actors, Sam Waterson and Haing Ngor both displayed godlike pieces of acting. It's unfortunate Waterson couldn't join Ngor in Academy Awards. In addition, the director's credit is to highlight both the characters' points of view. That's why the movie became so interesting to watch. John Malkovich brought out a fine performance as a photographer. In the course of the story of adventures of the two men, the film also has vivid descriptions of the public life during the war. Several detailed scenes of war violence are presented here so indifferently that you are bound to be convinced about its historical accuracy. Here we find the magical cinematography of Chris Menges. Again, during the time of Dith Pran's suffering, it never seemed that the director is showing too much.One of the most important, and my favorite, aspects of the film is its ending. You cannot imagine of a better alternative of this happiest ending possible in a war drama. And with the fantastic use of Lennon's 'imagine', it has got to an enormous height of perfection. 5/5.",10,58,66,22 January 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Mindless... and surprisingly blank as an ending.
","The most disturbing feature of this last installment is that it is very 'disturbing'... to our eyes, to our minds and most important, to our expectations. It was quite evident in 'Reloaded' that the end will not be as fun as the start. But I thought at least there'd be something to watch, as in Reloaded. Well, 'Revolutions' have got some stunning visuals (for those who don't know!) but they are no longer soothing to the eyes. Why waste bucks on special effects and stuff when people can't watch it? Cluster of machines swarming over underground city, in the same fashion and shown from same angles, it got so freakishly boring. And the last Neo-Smith fight? it looks good in trailers, not in the movie that shows it for ten minutes or so.The story, perhaps was not so bad altogether. There are few surprises hopefully to save my investment behind the matrix saga. The ending is done well, though basically rubbish as an idea. The one positive point of this movie that it at least sticks to a basic path, not wandering wild as in Reloaded. It should have been so, because there were so many questions to answer.It's easy to say 'It could be better.' but the fact is it couldn't. I believe the modern cinema technology is still not enough to create a satisfactory ending of the Matrix, even with good ideas. And also, probably, the goals of the producers got changed after the success of the first. It's promises for intelligent food for thought must have been compromised for financial success. But it turns out as an overdose of this decision.",6,0,1,18 January 2005
The Village," Different from Shyamalan's other films... one needs to know that to appreciate it.
","Although being a fairly good admirer of M. Night Shyamalan's previous three films I did not go to see 'The Village' in theatres when it came out, partly because I was very busy with my work then and partly because I received negative comments from friends who saw it. I finally saw it on TV and am now regretting the fact that I missed its theatre screening.To speak things clearly, 'The Village' is not primarily 'a suspense-horror film with a sharp ending twist' as the popular description of his films goes. It is essentially a beautiful and faithful love story in the backdrop of an unusual situation. This backdrop has those elements of suspense and horror only to enrich the story, not to contaminate it. The film's social and political undertone shows how Shyamalan is growing more mature in writing cinematic materials, with several conflicting points of view interwoven with one another. And his visionary about the village and the woods is simply amazing. That makes it a visually stylish film too. And about the so-called 'plot twist', I think it was intentionally given away much too early, otherwise the original love story would have been largely affected. One must appreciate the film's ending, even if it does not contain any 'twist' as one might expect.Bryce Dallas Howard completely steals the show with her dedicated portrayal of Ivy; I'd definitely look for her future works. Joaquin Phoenix as an actor is also nice to watch. Adrien Brody remains a little under-utilized in my opinion. And one must not forget William Hurt's excellent acting as Ivy's father.The bottomline: To watch this film and appreciate it, it must not be compared with his previous films. It does not have their elements, but it has something new to offer. Keep and open mind for that.",8,2,2,17 March 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," With a good story...
","I was wondering at first if this third installment would live up to the class of the original saga without James Cameron. No, an aged Arnold Schwarzenegger was not my subject of concern. It was director Jonathan Mostow. He was good in U-571 but it was to see how he makes up with all the hypes. I was wondering about the story as well. The Terminator saga differs in this point from the other contemporary movie serieses. That it never had a specific storyline. When the Terminator (1984) was made, nobody knew nothing about a sequel. Terminator 3's exact story was not planned while making Terminator 2 (1992). This is probably the reason behind such long gaps between the movies. But I am quite satisfied with both. Mostow did a nice job. Of course he is no Cameron, but I liked his simple style. This movie had to contain some first-person storytelling by John Connor himself. There was no other way to describe the situation. I felt relieved to see Mostow did exactly that. There were some rather 'comic' sequences and dialogs. I take it as Mostow's credit as well. The casting was quite interesting. Schwarzenegger... well, it's irrelevant if he was good or not at this point. Claire Danes, probably one of the most underrated actresses of recent years, performed very well. Hers was a strong role. And it was perfect casting. Nick Stahl may look geekish in the movie but I found him not that bad as critics are saying. The surprise was Kristanna Loken. The idea of a female terminator was very unique, though not too unexpected. Whether she is decent as an actress the future can tell, but all I can say she fitted into the role very finely. She turned out to be one of the major attractions.And the story! I feel very happy to write that I enjoyed the story pretty much. It has probably the best story out of the three. Why? simply because it connects the past and the future. In the other three movies you just saw the possibility that Connor's going to lead the war against SkyNet in some future. But this movie showed exactly how it all began. In the shell it may look just like a replay of T2, with a robot from future to kill him and a robot to save him. But T3 is not all about that. It was a bold and revolutionary idea to show the start of the war at last. I don't know any plans about T4 this time, but as far as the things are going it may not feature Arnold at all. Quite enjoyable; 8/10.",8,0,0,28 July 2003
Van Helsing," Disappointing.
","I sat down to watch this film partly because IMDb users thought it's not as bad as the professional critics say. I generally find myself disagreeing with the professional critics but in this case I couldn't agree more. In the middle of the film it seemed like a torture to continue watching. There was no solid plot, the screenplay is as crampy as possible, the CGI effects were laughable and I don't know, this movie has the most annoying Count Dracula ever portrayed in film. Hugh Jackman portrays the lead character with some kind of 'Helsing... Van Helsing' style with Bond-like gadgets (wow, he also has a Q). Kate Beckinsale fitted much better into a vampire role (Selena) than this vampire-killer stuff. In all, it was a very very disappointing film.",4,1,3,26 October 2005
Save the Last Dance," A serious film... with that hip-hop!
","First of all I like to confess that I'm not a fan of hip-hop myself, I never was. When I sat to watch this movie in a TV channel I knew nothing of its premises, whether it had hiphop, or it is produced by Mtv etc. The local TV listing pointed it out as a 'drama' and that's all. But in the end, somehow the movie got me like itself. Not only for its mild simplicity in story, direction, acting and screenplay, but also for its use of hip-hop. The main theme of the story is a clichÃ©, indeed. But the presentation is unique. Anti-racism is the movie's main theme, so is fusion in classical and popular music as well. This movie has romance, tension, sad moments, serious sequences... and amusingly to offer a surprise relief in all these seriousness, there comes hip-hop.Julia Stiles acted quite well, though I don't know if she used a stunt double during the shots of ballet dancing, because they were not good. Other than that, even during hip-hop dance scenes, she was good to watch. Sean Patrick Thomas, whose career I did not follow was very interesting. I got surprised to find out later that he was 31 when this movie is shot. He looked so original indeed. Rest of the cast offered a decent performance as well.In the end, I liked the show. It is better for Mtv to produce such movies more, since we tend to hail pop culture very easily. To blend that with such serious theme is still quite unique. 7/10",Null,0,2,29 July 2003
Collateral," Tom Cruise is excellent... so is Jamie Foxx.
","The reason for watching this film should only be Tom Cruise. He is just extraordinary at this against-his-type role. That bronze hair and that steely accent just redefined him as a perfect villain here. You can't get a single bit of that handsome good guy with pretty smile. In 'The Last Samurai' he was quite good, but here he is magnificent. And let's not forget Jamie Foxx also. He got an Academy nomination for this and why shouldn't he? Foxx perfectly portrays the simple-minded average-character taxi driver. Tough for him that 'Million Dollar Baby' released this year, otherwise he got a fair chance for Supporting Actor too; although I'll argue that Foxx's character wasn't confined to a mere 'supporting' category.And Michael Mann is a top quality filmmaker. And I think this is better that 'Ali' or 'Heat'. There are several shots of the city L.A. which somehow adds to a totality in the film. I like this style... this calm description of a suspense story. And the music used throughout the film are excellent. Definitely one of the best movies of 2004.",8,3,4,5 March 2005
Ocean's Eleven," Slick.
","Ocean's Eleven is one of the slickest films I've ever seen... to tell the simple truth. Soderbergh, a very talented director as he is, creates the perfect atmosphere of complex story, suspense, comedy and style. And he's got a bunch of stars to adorn this project of his, also helped out by taut and smart script. I haven't seen the Sinatra-starred film on which this is based upon, yet I don't think that one can never come close to this in terms of both story and standard.Speaking about the cast, I must say finally George Clooney is a relief to watch this time, after all the intolerable films he has done in recent past. Matt Damon, highly unutilised in this film, glitters in his short opportunities. Julia Roberts is as sophisticated as usual, bringing a classic touch to the atmosphere. Don Cheadle tries a fake accent which could have been a disaster if he would get a bigger role. However, the two actors who really stole the show are Brad Pitt and Andy Garcia. Pitt gives a perfect and passionate performance as Rusty. He's got the looks, got the attitude and here he does the job. Garcia's take on Benedict nicely shows the role's multifaceted character.I wouldn't spoil too much by discussing the story. I can only say, the major plot twist is just brilliant. I have seen such type of films quite a lot and I never predict even a particle of their original plan. The ending, some may not like it, I thought very necessary. In the end, 'Ocean's Eleven' may not be a classic film, but certainly one of the best films of its genre.",8,0,0,18 December 2005
Resident Evil," Only Milla Jovovich saved it.
","When Capcom's game of the same name first hit the market, it got many critic's praise due to its unique gaming style and for its excellent atmosphere of horror and suspense. Six years later, this movie version has neither followed the story or characters (this movie is rather a prequel of the game) nor presented that unique atmosphere of survival horror. In the end it turned out to be a cheap action movie with blazing guns, bloody gore, raw language and other accessories. The plot was a bit planned at the beginning but messed up in the end. Apart from all these, the movie simply rides the top with the help of a new fresh Milla Jovovich.Well, when you place Ms. former Joan of Arc in a skimpy red party dress with an assault rifle in hand you win half of the battle. But besides Milla is lucky to have a fine character on which the director offered much more attention than the story itself. And indeed she is good in such roles. And she was well assisted by good background soundtrack and camera angles. And a provocative ending too, allowing the viewers to dream whatever they can for Resident Evil 2.In all, the movie is actually nothing. You go just to watch Milla. and considering that I'm giving it no more than ***.",6,12,23,14 January 2003
The Butterfly Effect," An intriguing presentation of an interesting plot.
","Perhaps the theory of multiple universes or whatever one calls them has been in movie makers' eyes from the day it had been published. Indeed it makes a really entertaining storyline if used properly and intelligently... a good example is Tom Tykwer's classic 'Run Lola Run' where he uses a perfect blend of multiverse and chaos theories. 'The Butterfly Effect' may lack Tykwer's superb cinematic style but still it has a very unique plot, good screenplay and most of all, decent actors whose performances make this film a really serious experience in the end.Speaking of plot, I'm quite fascinated by the fact that the film did not hesitate to show anything that might be necessary to make it tight enough, however shocking and offensive they may be. It deals with quite a number of childhood and teenage misadventures, the presentation of which are indeed smart. Hats off to directors Gruber and Bress for that. Regarding acting, I have to say Ashton Kutcher really did a nice job in this different kind of role.To summarize, 'The Butterfly Effect' is a very intelligent and yet, entertaining film. Every scenario has their own unique and unpredictable dramatic moments... and that fun is rightly treated with a best possible ending.",8,0,1,20 November 2005
Batman Begins," The best superhero film ever made... a modern-day classic.
","To put it rather simply, 'Batman Begins' is not just the best Batman film, it is the best comic book adaptation film ever made... yes, keeping in mind 'Sin City' or 'Spider-Man 2'. Never before the screenplay was such mature, never before a storyline was such intriguing and never before a superhero film is backed by such a strong cast. But, giving proper respect to all the other departments like screenplay, acting, sound and visual effects, I must say this is Christopher Nolan's film. Hats off to you Mr. Nolan, you had taken a risk by attempting a film on how Bruce Wayne became Batman. It was a daunting task even Tim Burton couldn't try. But you reached a height beyond our expectations. I think even the harshest Wayne fan should be more than happy.Oh, where can I begin? The movie starts off with such a scene nobody can expect. The flashbacks are shown in masterful details. The story unfolds in such a manner one can just sit back in awe and watch in silence. The shock elements are plenty and action scenes never seemed overtly exaggerated. For the visuals, I must say it's a real feast for the eyes (Well, notice how the color theme of Batman changed from bluish-black to dark brownish-black in this film). The sound effects are awesome. One example must be given and that's when Batman suffers from hallucinations. There are quite a few catchy yet stylish monologues like, 'To condone fear, you must become fear.' or 'I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you.' The bat-mobile may look less visionary than the older versions, but this one is given far better treat in the film than the predecessors.Now just look at the cast: Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman... OK, you don't have to think about the character roles. They are in best hands. For the leading lady, Katie Holmes does a decent job by uttering 'Bruce...' sensually enough. But before going to Bale, I must mention one name and that's Cillian Murphy. His super-stylish portrayal of Scarecrow really freaked me out. True enough, he is one of the things one should see this film for. And for our Christian Bale, it's quite decided that except Val Kilmer to a bit, Clooney and Keaton are just no match. The role of the Dark Knight seems like wasted until now. Bale puts in his enormous passion for the role, he uses two different voices for Wayne and Batman. He in the bat-suit is just elegant while he as Wayne is so reserved and aristocratic.Oh, and the new Batman logo rocks!",10,4,6,20 June 2005
Blue Crush," Nice light mood entertainment.
","This is one of those films that you tend to like without any apparent reason. 'Blue Crush' is a quite flawed film, in fact. The story is too simplified. I wish there could be a little tension between the three girls in some places. The occasional bits of humor are not that clever. The ending could be more dramatic.What I liked about the film is its smart no-nonsense screenplay and the characters. Anne Marie is a brilliantly written character with so many aspects of quality and natural shortcomings... and Kate Bosworth captured her image quite effectively. All the girls are nicely shown in a cool, stylish yet somehow very non-sexual simple manner... and they were portrayed by very capable actresses.And of course the surf scenes are extremely well shot. The film didn't open in theatres in my country and now I regret that fact. All those huge waves, and those sunny beaches, and the surfers and the music... I wished I could be a part of that scenario. That's one of the reasons why the film left a lasting impression in my mind.",6,0,0,25 June 2006
28 Days Later...," What makes it different...
","This film is about a virus, 'Rage' virus that makes the infected person mad with extreme rage and hungry for blood. Within 28 days one outbreak in London caused entire Britain dead or evacuated leaving behind a blood-thirsty infected population and a handful of solitary normal persons. Civilization came to a halt, society got destroyed while those limited survivors fight for existence among frequent attack by the vicious victims.Sounds familiar? Then what makes '28 Days Later...' a classic among a horde of zombie/biohazard movies? Simply a touch of art that Danny Boyle is able to bring what others could not. The others focus too much on extensive, special-effects-controlled, gory action sequences between infected and normals, with heavy background music. But here there's always a tinge of sadness, emptyness, helplessness. Consider that empty London scene with that background music. We found out there's much else to show than just electrifying action or gore to describe the picture of life in this condition that these movies talk about.There are mistakes and loopholes in this movie. But that couldn't weaken the otherwise tight-gripping storyline. The greatest achievement of this movie is to make one viewer stay neutral throughout the film, without taking any side in the first place. Because the virus we talk about is simply used as a metaphor. 'Rage' is shown as a social disease. That makes it a 'serious' film, not a flick. Every person, even the harshest critic of zombie horror movies should watch this. 5 out of 5 stars.Oh, did I mention Cillian Murphy was awesome?",8,356,456,30 December 2004
X-Men: The Last Stand," Smart, politically inspired script, awesome action... definitely a huge summer blockbuster.
","In Ratner's hands, X3 becomes more story-centered, with diverse ideas and sub-plots. Character development was given least importance. The basic plot leaves the straight Magneto vs Xavier or Human vs Mutant simplicity. It becomes a complex tale of rationality and existence. Some major characters are dealt with surprising change and some new characters are introduced. The story gives rise to enough questions and though-provoking insights. In short, 'X-Men: The Last Stand' is not just another comic-book movie, it's an original film with interesting philosophy, where only the premise is a comic book.Ratner took some revolutionary decisions when it comes to dealing with characters like Jean Grey, Xavier, Mystique, Cyclops and Magneto. Among the newly introduced characters, Ellen Page's Kitty Pryde was given the best handling, especially in the last action sequence. For the other characters, Anna Paquin's Rogue was definitely under-used. Rebecca Romijn's (Mystique) only memorable part was lying naked on the floor. Regulars like Logan, Storm, Iceman etc are in usual bloom and carry the story. Yet, for the first time the story perhaps avoids focusing on one character. One may argue that this film is mostly about Jean (or her alter-ego Phoenix, rather) but no, that's a misconception. This film is solely about the Cure and its effects.The action sequences are quite enjoyable, often with smart comic moments. The use of visual effects is also perfect. One major flaw in this film is perhaps the absurd extent of Phoenix's capabilities as shown. Somehow they felt suddenly just too much. And it was a major part of the film's plot. But let's not be bothered about that, because X Men 3 has got all the elements of a successful summer blockbuster.",8,1,2,29 May 2006
School of Rock," Comedy's back in Black.
","So, this modern fairy-tale is one hell of a ride through the best of rock music mixed with a type of humor it had never experienced before. Well, the basic plot is as adorable as it can be. A down-and-out rocker takes a job of a substitute teacher at a private school and forms his own rock band with his fifth grade students by influencing them from classical music to rock. This excellent story is backed by smart and really funny screenplay (there are some brilliant bits e.g. 'Pig Rectum?') and passionate direction by Linklater. But what makes it really great is no-one but Jack Black and also, the supporting cast.Jack Black is a good comedy actor. We all knew about that. But he's also a guy who has real passion for rock and himself a good musician too. So in this film his performance is not only exceptional, it's perhaps inspirational to all the child actors present. Besides his trademark facial expressions and accent, his stage persona that we see in this film is also something that makes this film really entertaining. Joan Cusack delivers also another brilliant performance as the school's tough principal yet a secret Fleetwood Mac fan. All the kids in this film gave their best efforts when it comes to acting and really, as musicians some of them are indeed jaw-dropping, especially Joey Gaydos as the lead guitarist and Kevin Clark as the drummer with a 'bad boy' image. You might want to follow their music career as well.As I mentioned earlier that this film is like a fairy-tale, one should not give too much thoughts about reality. Indeed some things may appear impossible, like Freddie learning drums in, well, the speed of light. The primary objective of the film is top quality entertainment. And it never fails in that, with great performances, truly funny dialogues, smart characters and yes, excellent soundtrack. Indeed, it provides the most fun I've had watching movies in a while.",8,1,2,20 October 2005
No Man's Land," Tanovic's unique view of war
","In these days, most of the successful war films are mainly comprised of spectacular action sequences, bloody and most realistic scenes of war violence, disturbing picture and continuous thunderous sound effects. No Man's Land, a low-budget film from Bosnia, has practically none of these. Yet it should be considered one of the most spectacular war dramas ever made. Full credit to Tanovic for presenting us a magnificient story, superb direction and most important, the message the film carries.What war actually is, we the common people who stay away, cannot understand. We take war as a hot topic to discuss, a set of stories to sell, a subject to argue about in the parliaments, a headline to adorn the first page of newspapers. We can never get the true spirit of war. Only soldiers, who suffered, who bore hardship, who lost everything, can only feel it. Others practically enjoy war as if it's a movie. So through Tanovic's lens, everyone is guilty, everyone..... politicians, media persons, journalists, peacekeepers from UN...... everyone who is related, but not directly involved. Why? because they don't think of the future of the soldiers, they only think about the future of the war.This basic message is the heart and soul of the movie. And the superb, provocative ending.... it's just a satire meant for other commercial filmmakers. Tanovic really did a revolutionary job in this film. He was well assisted by the two main actors. Branko Djuric is excellent as Chiki and Rene Bitorajac has also performed quite well. I don't understand the language, but I saw it with English subtitles. So, for a movie which starts off with a four-letter-word, No Man's Land is certainly far beyond your expectations.",Null,1,3,26 January 2003
Wimbledon," Likable, yet flawed presentation of a dream.
","A British ultimately winning the Wimbledon -- the much-adored dream of a nation finally comes alive... doesn't matter even if in a movie... and how! Beating the no.1 foul-tempered American kid, winning the heart of young rising tennis glamour queen... this is how dreams should be. Leave no boundaries, no attachment to reality when you have a dream. And yes, these dreams are indeed for people like Peter Colt-- non-aggressive, soft-spoken and willing to leave a mark before life is practically over.Just wondering, there should have been less factual errors... or flaws, whatever you call them. A British guy playing the Wimbledon semifinal in some side court whereas Henman, Rusedski play their every match in Centre Court? Also there should have been at least one shot of Colt with the trophy... instead the sequence ends with Colt and Lizzy kissing. I also think the role of paparazzi in the Colt-Lizzy affair is hugely underestimated, in reality there would be much more fuss over this. Imagine Sharapova falling in love with some male tennis player during a Grand Slam.But yes, Paul Bettany is a real treat to watch in this film.",6,0,1,19 November 2005
Million Dollar Baby," A bit overrated, still the genius of the actors made it good enough to call it great.
","I've now seen two recent boxing films in two days. And I'm astonished (and glad too) to find out how much 'Million Dollar Baby' differs from 'Cinderella Man'. The latter one is a highly passionate presentation of a heroic, though predictable, true story. Million Dollar Baby is not stylish or passionate, its simplicity in direction or cinematography is a necessary marker of the harsh reality it depicts, unlike the fairy-tale truth of Cinderella Man. One can easily divide the film in two parts, and the first one is truly about boxing.Cinderella Man is primarily a story of a man's struggle through life, only his profession is boxing. But the first part of MDB is about boxing and its technical details. In this case, according to the opinions of the viewers who know about boxing, Eastwood made some serious mistakes (some of them are listed in the 'Goofs' section). But the last half of the film shows us that boxing and technical details are not the point of this film too. How Eastwood and the screenwriters bring about the shocking plot twist and the brilliant ending is truly the best part of the film.Now speaking of the actors, what can I say, it is one of the few films where all of the main cast members are at their best. I'm sure soon Hilary Swank will be type-casted in such roles, she's so good at them. Morgan Freeman is always a pleasure to watch. Here his character's cold chemistry with Frankie Dunn is quite enjoyable. For Eastwood, I don't know what to say, but I'm sure there are few performances that supply constant inspiration to all the people involved with cinema industry, it's one of them.But as a director, Eastwood falters from his last year classic standard of 'Mystic River'. Maybe because as I've said earlier that this film is about harsh reality, not passion or style, Eastwood's direction is surprisingly bland, without any moment to praise whole-heartedly. Especially the boxing matches are utterly below average display. It's funny he got the Academy Award for direction, not acting.",8,0,1,11 October 2005
Garden State," A wonderful film that speaks of a generation.
","'Garden State' is simply a beautiful movie, an example of the versatile genius as a writer and director of Mr. Zach Braff. The originality of its story, its dialogues and its characters are unique. And as a twenty-something sitting in this 2006, I surely felt this personal connection to this film. It speaks of my generation, in a way few other films could.Mr. Braff must have written the characters Andrew, Sam and Mark out of personal experience... otherwise the standard of their originality is really hard to achieve. Sam, as free-spirited as she could be, captures the audience from her very first appearance with the brilliant line: 'Are you really retarded?'. And Mark with his 'I-don't-give-a-shit-to-this-life' attitude is also a character to relate to. But surely Andrew Largeman is the strangest character. Many of his traits are quite obvious, predictable, natural... still there are some depths we cannot measure and that makes him so unique, so like all of us yet so different.As an actor, Zach Braff does a fair job, but couldn't get entirely out of his 'Scrubs' persona. Peter SarsgaÃ¥rd also brings a nice touch to the character of Mark. But it's Natalie Portman who steals the show as Sam. She brings out Sam's eccentricity as the most natural thing on earth, her sudden changes of emotion flow in her so easily. I must say this is one of her finest performances to date.One last thing I must talk about as few other reviewers did and that's the soundtrack. It is wonderfully compiled according to the film's mood, featuring all of my favorite musicians and all the songs are used in totally right moments... what can I say? From Coldplay's 'Don't Panic' in the very beginning to Paul Simon's 'The only living boy in New York' to Frou Frou's 'Let Go' in the end, the film is a magical journey of real good music.'Garden State' is one of the best movies that came out in 2004... but to those who can personally relate to this film, it's much more.",9,0,1,12 August 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Baseless... but worth renting.
","I read many times in several reviews that fans of the game series would love this film. I can't see why. One cannot create that 'survival horror' environment into such films (don't bring '28 days later' in comparison) and thus one, a fan of the games or not, should watch this film keeping no presumptions in mind. I was disappointed in doing that.The prequel had a provocative ending, giving rise to several interesting possible ideas in my mind, thanks to the fact that I'm an avid fan of the games myself. But little could I predict about this noisy, baseless, cheap action extravaganza. There are only characters taken from the game, nothing else. The premise was good, but the results aren't. Introduction of Nemesis could have been avoided, because he is simply wasted here. Most of the action sequences come suddenly, without any link to the story. And to tell the truth, there is no 'story' involved, just an excuse.Milla Jovovich is not as spicy as she was in the first movie. Sienna Guillory as Jill is good. Perhaps she is one thing that perfectly matches with the game. The other characters are not worth mentioning. There are some good moments in the film, like the ending, or the incident in the school, but all over I think the first one was better. The movie leaves a chance for a third part, I am not sure if that's a good thing for us.The bottomline: watching it in a theatre is inadvisable. The DVD should come out soon. Rent and watch. We've got better things to buy.",5,2,6,26 December 2004
Blood Diamond," Brutal... both in violence and honesty.
","'Blood Diamond' is another typical example of a class of Hollywood movies that makes you sick but you cannot leave the theatre until they end. The film gruesomely portrays the social aspects of civil war in so-called third-world countries... child soldiers, slavery, prostitution, political corruption at their best. The opportunistic standpoint of the Western developed nations in such matters is also delicately pointed out. And all these are brilliantly done with the help of three totally different characters: a poor fisherman in Sierra Leone who accidentally finds a large diamond in the conflict mines, a tough 'white trash' smuggler of conflict diamonds and a no-nonsense American journalist whose primary goal is to sell a good story.The film is extremely well-acted. Leonardo DiCaprio again effectively sheds off his boyish charm in this tough criminal role of smuggler Archer and his Academy Award nomination is hundred percent justified. Jennifer Connelly did not receive the best dialogues, I must say, but she does a pretty believable job in this rather tomboyish role. But it's Djimon Hounsou who steals the show with his extremely passionate portrayal of the fisherman Solomon Vandy. Solomon is a rather complex character and it's wonderful to watch Hounsou's take on him, especially at that scene when he finally bursts out in the end when violence was constantly imposed upon him. May he receive more complex roles in future projects.The screenplay, though wonderful to express the true situation of African civil war, appears exaggerated at times (e.g. the child soldier points his AK47 to Archer in the car and shouts 'Who is this motherf---er?'). Some dialogues appear a tad too dramatic. The story suddenly seemed to rush right after the diamond was found in the end. Edward Zwick is an excellent director and we all love his works but here he fails to develop a new style of storytelling. All the scenes of violence and torture are just usually graphic and without any originality.Still, this is one of the best films to come out in 2006... because somehow it's very honest. It doesn't exaggerate any of the characters. It does not take a stand to glorify one particular nation. 'Blood Diamond' must be an eye-opener to many filmmakers who often shout out morals in their films.",8,0,1,10 April 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Intriguing visionary by Kaufman... with a thought-provoking message.
","I wish I could write and write whatever comes in my mind about this magnificent piece of art called film-making. But all those would ultimately come to one bottomline: I don't give the credit to the director, as it is Kaufman's masterpiece screen writing that brings such magic to this film to make it one of the best examples of modern fimmaking.The idea of revisiting the memories is so overused and equally ill-treated in films that I'm sure every other screenwriter would mess it up in the end. But Kaufman pulled it off flawlessly. In a non-linear film such as this, I'm also surprised by the directing style. And it also helped to have such a fantastic cast. Carrey, playing a normal commonplace guy this time without any of his trademark characteristics and antics, reminds us that he is primarily a genius actor regardless of the type of film. Winslet, having a magnificent consistency of skill in each film is always a treat to watch. Her portrayal of Clementine is perhaps one of her bests... along with Finding Neverland and Jude. And there are also good supporting roles played by Wilkinson and the ever-interesting Mark Ruffalo.The film does carry an interesting message about love and relationship and sacrifice and adjustment. Those who can relate to them will definitely like the film more and more. When I saw the film a year ago, I didn't have any such experience which could make me take the film more personally. But I do have one now, which I can somehow relate to the film's message. That made me discover its wonders again.",9,0,2,3 February 2006
National Treasure," Relaxing.
","I didn't expect much from a movie that finds loads of treasure hidden in the heart of NYC. I knew it would be foolish to try to find witty script with believable and logical storyline. The film is for pure family entertainment, a target which it reached quite fruitfully. This is a film to watch in a relaxed mood, not to be bothered by the lack of silly detailing and realism.The theme, a secret code running in a family/cult to protect a treasure, is now a very popular one. The story finds its way through the formula of 'clue leading to another clue'. And for the mixture of these two elements, the viewer never loses his interest. The clues are not too complicated, well-carried out and most of all, fun. I was beginning to suspect there's actually no treasure, but that was only my complicated paranoia.Nicolas Cage is always fun to watch. And this role of a treasure-hunter suits fine to him. Diane Kruger looks nice as Abigail Chase. Justin Bartha is quite good as Cage's sidekick. The film also has Jon Voight and Sean Bean.To tell the truth, it is one of the few decent treasure movies I've seen lately... more realistic than 'Tomb Raider' and with a touch of Indiana Jones, all in New York. I liked that.",7,0,1,5 May 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Faithful adaptation, excellent casting... and Howard didn't disappoint us.
","Let me begin with what I think about the book. I think though it is poorly written, it is extremely clever in creating sensation. The characters are one-dimensional, the story too cheesy, but the plot and the theme are extremely interesting, revolutionary and its controversy well-marketed. And yes, the codes were entertaining.Now for the film, which obviously created more sensation than the book, delivers enough satisfaction to both... those who read the book and those who hadn't. My companion haven't read it yet but she enjoyed the film as much as I did. Howard created a very faithful adaptation of Brown's novel. He only omitted a few rather unnecessary portions of the story for the sake of time and left out one or two steps in the story's code-breaking sequence, which was perhaps good for a moviegoer who haven't read the book. For example, the film deals with only one cryptex. The film also introduces one or two added scenes that only added to the entertainment... like Sophie's joking attempt to walk on the water in the end.A strong feature of the film is its casting. Each main character is casted according to his/her nationality. Tom Hanks gives us another perfect professional performance as Robert Langdon. He's indeed not the way I imagined while reading the book but Hanks's expertise got over that feeling. On the other hand, Audrey Tautou's Sophie Neveu is absolutely what I imagined during the reading -- strong-willed, intelligent yet soft in demeanor. Tautou, an enormously talented actress as she is, makes Sophie one of the film's strongest points. There's much critical praise for Ian McKellen as Leigh Teabing and I agree with the critics here. And finally for the two Opus Dei people, though Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa is under-utilised, Paul Bettany steals every scene he's in as Silas. His self-torture scene at the beginning is priceless.Then what are the film's flaws? One is certainly its wooden dialogues. Well, the basic plot may give rise to laughter when you present them with such flat words. And some of the viewers in the theatre indeed giggled when Langdon let out Sophie's secret in the end. I believe its for the film's attempted simplicity for the 'virgin' audiences. Still, there should have been more smart lines. The next thing is the rush the film runs with. Yes, one has to adapt a 500 page novel in a two-hour film. Still, some key secrets demand slow detailing... otherwise much thrill is lost. That's exactly what happened. At least the final secret about the Merovingian bloodline needed more time to grow. I think three hours should have been the film's ideal duration.Lastly, an appeal to the viewers: please don't rate or judge the film from your religious standpoint. Films/books are pieces of art and entertainment. I'm frankly surprised by this film's IMDb rating. It certainly is worth more. It's not a masterpiece, but it's definitely the year's one of the most entertaining films.",7,3,6,29 May 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," The last word of entertainment.
","The hype did survive. After watching the 2-hour long visual wonder from the Wachowskis one must admit that. Yes, the story was too wandering, loosely binding some solitary self-sufficient action sequences; the lead actors did not seem quite well; the screenplay is not as well as the first one -- everything is true. But what about the ultimate visual experience that the Brothers offered? What about the enormous set decoration? What about the dazzling background music and soundtrack? And lastly, what about the never-seen-before adrenaline-soaked non-stop action? Tell me, how can you deny them?The film opens abruptly, ends abruptly, clearly pointing out that it's just a second movie of a trilogy. The much-hyped Zion makes its screen debut here finally and extremely well designed... the cave especially, where a drop-dead dance scene is shot with some fine piece of world music. The sex scene between Neo and Trinity was interesting to watch. There he, soft and fragile like a girl, and she, hard and strong like a guy, did make an unusual couple. I wish there was no romantic interest between them, because it looked so odd. The fight scene between Neo and numerous Agent Smiths was magnificient. Hugo Weaving reprised his much famous role, though without consequence, but brilliantly. The sequence was so well shot and Keanu Reeves was looking so beautiful with that long suit that sometimes it seemed Neo is directing some orchestra, the Smiths being the players. It's naturally one of the top three attractions of the movie. As the second comes the motorcycle run by Trinity with the keymaker. I stared holding my breathe, open-mouthed, when she started in the opposite direction.As I said earlier, performance of the lead actors could not impress me. This time Keanu Reeves looked too mechanical, like a robot with a sunglass. But maybe it's not his fault. The role was that... playing god, virtually. Carrie Anne-Moss... probably the most unattractive heroine treated so lovingly by an attractive hero, was quite plain. Fishburne looked good during the speech, but otherwise unimpressive. The new casts were rather good. Along with Niobe, the Twins, the Councillor, it's totally thumbs up for Persephone. According to my thinking, Monica Bellucci, though in her short role, is the third most attractive feature of the film. Her appearence, as well as delivery of speech, is truly wonderful. I hope she will get a bigger role in Revolutions.The story is rather complex, or in fact, there could be no story at all. The very concept of the keymaker is just to introduce two super action sequences I believe. In that sense Reloaded is just a trailer for the Revolutions. But it's sheer entertainment, there's no question about that. 8/10",9,0,0,7 July 2003
Mystic River," Eastwood's ultimate masterpiece.
","I don't know how Mr. Eastwood makes it possible to upgrade such a simple basic plot to this shocking yet heartbreaking ending or how he puts such intensity to every single word the characters speak or how he shows scenes of a usual downtown neighborhood that feels so much personal yet alien to the actions in the film. I don't know how he takes out the career-best performances from each and every actor in this film, even Kevin 'Tremors' Bacon and Lawrence Fishburne. With enough respect to Peter Jackson, I don't know how the Academy denied his Oscar that year.I don't know how Sean Penn puts so much passion in a character that's so against his type. His performance as Jimmy is not only one of the most honest performances I've ever seen, it's perhaps one of the most versatile, most contrasting one till date. His other masterful works like in Dead Man Walking or The Asassination of Richard Nixon are simply no comparison. This acting one does once in a lifetime.And, I don't know how Tim Robbins could regain such acting ability after all these years. I don't know why his role was nominated in the supporting actor category. I'd very much like to see them competing for one award. Surely that'd make some hairs gray.",9,1,1,12 March 2006
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Film
","It's not that common people knew John Forbes Nash jr., a Princeton mathematician after he recieved Nobel Prize for his 'Game Theory'. It's not that people started to know him after Sylvia Nasar wrote his biography. What made John Nash a household name is Ron Howard's brilliant direction and Russell Crowe's excellent performance as the scizophrenic genious.Russell Crowe exceeds all of his past performances in this film. He did not act as Nash, he became Nash. His facial expression while solving a problem, his innocent and shy smile during romantic sequences and his vacant look during the time of scizophrenia are in a word magnificient, and shockingly original. Jennifer Connelly also put a beautiful performance as his devoted wife Alicia. The actings of these two are the core of success of this film. I am still in a dark why Crowe is denied his Oscar for the best actor.
Ron Howard changed the original story in some places a bit, but only to make it more enjoyable. His main goal was to feature Nash's point of view to his world and he has succeeded totally. The shot in the cafe` where Nash first understands the significance of the application of his theory is brilliantly taken and is the best example of Howard's genious as a filmmaker. The make-up throughout the film is drop-dead gorgeous as they showed Nash and Alicia aging in the course of the film. Thus the Russell Crowe in the beginning and the Russell Crowe in the end become two different entities due to the superb art of the make-up artists.A Beautiful Mind will be considered one of the best biopics ever. It is dramatic, descriptive, detailed, reflective, enthusiastic, heroic and in all, a beautiful film. 10/10.",10,108,153,18 January 2003
The Departed," Entertaining and well-acted... but definitely over-rated.
","First of all, best Scorsese film? Please, forget 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull' or 'Goodfellas'... even 'Gangs of New York' had more passion, class and originality. Scorsese just used all of his old violence shots and visual tricks once again and somehow the Academy suddenly rubbed their eyes and said 'Oh we've overlooked the guy for so long. Come child, here's candy!'I'm not actually dissing the movie though. It's got a smart plot, although that's influenced by the classic Hong Kong film. It's got thrilling action sequences, moments of sheer suspense and a very entertaining ending with well-crafted plot twists. The original score is just plain awesome. The allover acting is top-notch... Leo DiCaprio does a very convincing job while Matt Damon's performance is somehow a bit flat. Jack Nicholson is damn charismatic as usual. Among the supporting roles by Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg, it's Mark who steals the show with his impulsive and ever-sarcastic persona.Then why is the film so far from being perfect? The storycrafting and the screenplay of course. The characters are, well, pretty one-dimensional, shown in black or white... especially Colin Sullivan. Even Dicaprio's character just whines about his job, but that's all. The supporting characters, except Dignam in the end, fail to add enough substantiality to the story. The story itself moves unrealistically fast... thereby leaving the audience completely fooled by its occasional flashes of action sequences. The dialogues, oh god, what can I say? Using the word 'fuck' in every line more than once neither makes the screenplay a classic, nor makes it realistic.To summarise, 'The Departed' is violent, smart, well-acted and also a well-directed thriller. But it's definitely not more Oscar-worthy than Scorsese's other classic works for one simple reason - it's not quite original. It offers nothing new.And that's that.",7,1,3,26 May 2007
War of the Worlds," It's all praise for Spielberg's perspective.
","Steven Spielberg. Tom Cruise. An H. G. Wells classic. Do we need more names? Do we need more hype? But that's where the problem is. We tend to expect too much. We expected it would be another masterpiece by the director. No, 'War of the Worlds' is not Spielberg's masterpiece. His 'Minority Report' with Cruise was even better. But what I dislike is how we thrash everything that doesn't meet our rising demands. Some critics described it as 'major disappointment of the year' or 'worst Spielberg film'! Excuse me?! What more can you possibly want of this story that you've read a hundred times since childhood? I'm glad that Spielberg didn't change any basic structure or ideas of the story and ruin it. What he added are touches of his genius.Forget about special visual or sound effects. When Spielberg makes a blockbuster sci-fi, they are always top-notch. What I want to discuss is his perspective in storytelling. I confess, it's really hard to make a film about hostile alien invasion in serious mood after all these years (especially after Mr. Burton's 'Mars Attacks'). Technologically advanced fierce-looking aliens destroying cities and killing humans without any apparent reason -- this is now comedy element. Serious movie aliens are now either friendly as in Spielberg's own 'E.T.' or if they are hostile, they're sinister and mysterious enough. And they find no reason to declare war on Earth in a mass scale. So I think Spielberg took a major risk on making this film, because it doesn't fit in the modern alien trend (I know how I disliked 'Independence Day').So what can he do to fit this thing in the trend? Tell the story not from a well-educated telescope-wise guys point of view as Wells did, but from a common middle-class worker with social problems. Enter Tom Cruise as Ray: dock worker, divorced, with two children. He's got enough problems before he thinks of alien invasion. What we see in this film is what he sees. He's the representative of a part of mankind and the movie deals with how that part is affected. It's a wise decision by Spielberg not to include everybody in action. So he didn't show how the politicians react, how the scientists react or how religious leaders react. The greatest thing about this film is this is first-person and that person is not a hero to mankind by fighting the aliens. All he does is to save himself and his kids. And how Spielberg built his experiences! His magical visions and excellent cinematography aided him to make some classic shots like, the radiation massacre on the running crowd by the aliens or the 'hide-and-seek' in Ogilvy's cellar.But is there nothing really in this film that deserves criticism? Take the characters: Robbie, the son, is an extremely two-dimensional character and the guy who played him is equally pathetic. There was no need to bring this character. Rachel's character also appeared a little bit conflicting. The grenade trick that Ray did is just very cheap and entirely unexpected from Spielberg or Koepp. And for the ending, I wish it was more dramatic. It entirely lacked the surprise element.Tom Cruise may be nuts off-screen, but once again he shows why he is the highest paid actor and the most wanted movie star now. He develops the character of Ray nicely, any other actor would overact and ruin it. Dakota Fanning is just awesome. She successfully brings out the inner mentality of a girl of her age and thus gives the character a serious importance. And Tim Robbins delivers yet another impressive character performance as Ogilvy.There are plenty of moments in this film that reflects Spielberg's originality. Most of them one would appreciate (I won't spoil it by mentioning them) and some one would disapprove. It's really stupid to say things like 'It's the best invasion movie ever' or 'best take on Wells classic' about this film. Because that depends on time. The more the cinema technology would develop, the better these films would be. But Mr. Spielberg once again showed there are other things to praise besides CGI in a sci-fi film. Yes, he could do better, but it is the best we could get.",9,4,8,3 July 2005
Man on Fire," Well acted and written, but overtly stylish in cinematography.
","Depending upon the story, screenplay and most of all, acting, I could easily give this film 9 out of 10. Released more or less at the same time with a horde of good 'revenge' movies, 'Man on Fire' shines bright with its linear but bold basic plot, turned into a smart screenplay with measured amounts of action and emotion and with some catchy dialogues as well. Denzel Washington again delivers a powerful performance right from the beginning. Dakota Fanning is indeed a promising starlet, and she developed a unexpectedly nice chemistry with Washington. The supporting cast are also worth mentioning, especially Radha Mitchell whose character changed with a sharp contrast during the course of the film. I personally think the talent of Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke are basically wasted in this film.But the film's technically superior visual style is quite annoyingly overdone, one must say that. I don't mind the use of color filters and high contrast (I even think they're used better than in 'Traffic' too) but what annoyed me is the random use of shaky visionaries and montage-influenced editing which got tiresome after a while. I think Tony Scott is eager to develop his own trademark by using that style but here he could easily avoid its overuse.",7,0,1,26 March 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Whitaker's Amin had 'Oscar' written over his face...
","'The Last King of Scotland' is definitely one of the best movies based on real events ever. Though the film is not entirely fact-based... it's told from a fictional character's point of view, but the audience, particularly those who were around in the time of Idi Amin's regime can breathe realism in its every minute.The introduction of the storyteller, a young Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, was important to create subjective angles. Yet the character is not at all as inert as one would seem. He is perhaps the leading character in the film, not Idi Amin. And Garrigan's character is wonderfully designed... with his initial careless nature, his sexual (mis)adventures, his later concerns and helplessness etc. James McAvoy does a fantastic job playing this role. The essence of the character is beautifully captured by him.But everybody knows if there's one reason to see this film that'd be Forest Whitaker's performance as the infamous dictator. Whitaker captures the character's brutality, insanity and his weaknesses in their most minute details. Whitaker seems to know what it takes to be a dictator. His work had 'Oscar' written over it.",9,1,2,15 May 2007
American Gangster," Scott shines again... along with two of the best actors of our time.
","Ridley Scott loves his villains. He has always attempted to show the characters with questionable morality in a new light. His characters are never black or white... they just roam in different shades of grey.Frank Lucas, the character on the other side of law, a drug lord in 70s New Jersey, is Scott's principal character in this film. But Scott would never paint him out-and-out dark with villainy. He needs someone who would play it just according to the right shade of grey. And here we got Denzel Washington. In the scene where Frank shows his newly-bought mansion to his mother and says - 'Momma this is your house' ... and in the scene where he puts a bullet through someone's head in the middle of a crowded street - Washington is equally convincing, a delightful screen presence.These stories particularly need a 'good cop'. High morals, troubled personal life, on the verge of career end, standing alone among his corrupted colleagues - you know the stereotype. This is Ritchie Roberts played by none other than Russell Crowe. Crowe is proved champion in playing such diligent, meticulous characters. Here his accent, attention and mannerisms are perfect. Josh Brolin is again awesome in his supporting role.Based on a true story, the screenplay does a good job in curbing the need of first-person narrations in such a story. It is surprisingly low-key, but is able to deliver the required amount of tension and style. The action sequences are extremely well-balanced, ruthless but never seemed tiring. 'American Gangster' is definitely one of the best movies of 2007... but it falls short of absolute greatness, for a reason somehow unknown.",8,0,2,17 March 2008
The Green Mile," Excellent cast makes it an awesome film.
","There are plenty of films based on novels by Stephen King. Some are truly classic... like Pet Sematary, Cujo, Shawshank Redemption or Apt Pupil; and some are crap like Maximum Overdrive, Carrie, The Dark Half or Dreamcatcher. There are good movies based on not-so-good novels, and there are unsatisfactory screen adaptations of excellent King thrillers. 'The Green Mile' is one of the good movies based on a not-so-good novel by Mr King. Perhaps the principal reason for this is its very good casting. Now-a-days you can always expect an above-average performance from Tom Hanks, and here he is once again at his best. Michael Clark Duncan looks extremely realistic as the convict John Coffey. And the rest of the supporting cast are also excellent, especially Sam Rockwell and Mike Jeter. Gary Sinise again mesmerizes us with a brilliant cameo. Even if one has read the book many times, the allover acting throughout the movie should make him glued to the seat.",8,0,1,6 April 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," It's the Dark Side that rules.
","Thank you Mr. Lucas for letting us finally believe that you still have that magic. The magic that divides the entire history of cinema into two parts -- pre- and post- Star Wars era i.e. before and after 1977. The magic that draws the greatest number of net surfers to visit a movie site. And now in 2005, you delivered the true nature of that Force in a final movie about which everybody knows everything before seeing it, about which 'spoiler' is an invalid term, which doesn't make one happy face in the crowd that leaves the theatre.So what makes 'Revenge of the Sith' the best of the three Star Wars movies of our generation? Apparently most of the things didn't improve from Ep-II. The screenplay still remains wooden, some lightsaber battles are still boringly long, the actors are still delivering disappointing performances (except Ian McDiarmid and Ewan McGregor of course) and the comic reliefs inserted here and there are still annoying. Then what? It's the Dark Side of the Force. Along with Anakin, we also gradually learned and experienced it's enormous power, to get us glued to the seat and watch in awe how cinematic it is. How Lucas inserted a feeling of Darkness in every scene of the movie, in its every action, every dialogue. So we sat thunderstruck when the young-lings were killed, got restless when the Jedi community was destroyed, and applauded (yes, we did) in unison when our favorite Darth Vader in his trademark mask, helmet and costume appeared on the screen. The Dark Side got us all. Mr. Lucas, you showed us it's far more photogenic, cinematic and attractive for mass appeal. Wow!But still, still... the pain that there'll be no more Star Wars movie will torture us forever.",10,2,7,24 May 2005
Blade Runner," A pioneer in the genre of sci-fi.
","This is one of the five timeless classics that literally shaped the genre of science fiction in modern cinema. 'Blade Runner' is shockingly original in its concept, with considerable depth in its theme and vision. Much has been written in the other user comments about the story and its philosophical implications, the acting, the screenplay etc. I just want to focus on two major aspects of the film.The film brilliantly captures PKD's vision about the future. PKD has always outlined a rather dystopic society, with paranoia screaming out of its every corner. The film's use of dark sets, smoke, faded light, night-time rain, broken buildings, exotic people has effectively set the right mood for what PKD had dreamt of - a society on the verge of breakdown, living on the edge with crime, corruption and misused technology. All credits must go to the art/set directors, the cinematographers and of course to Mr. Scott himself.The original music is just breathtaking. Vangelis created the right sound for every mood, mostly dominated by paranoia and fear of the unknown. The use of foreign music in many scenes only add to the vision of cultural complexity.The director's cut is vastly superior than the original release not only because it excludes the voice-over, but because of the brilliant extra footage and altered ending. It designs a more perfect way to throw out the question whether Deckerd himself was a replicant or not.",9,1,3,24 August 2007
Casino Royale," Craig rules... any question?
","James Bond movies... since 1960s they have been faithfully delivering every aspects of popular entertainment in proper measures. Some of them are above average, some fell short. Still, in the end, you can predict the ingredients of a typical Bond movie - foolish political outback, advanced gadgets, Bond girls and sex scenes, gambling, some gunfighting, some physical actions, one 'Bond, James Bond' comment, one 'martini, shaken not stirred' comment etc etc. Then why so much interest about Casino Royale?One is definitely Daniel Craig. The man's serious alright. This guy excludes all those air of funny sarcasm out of Bond's persona. And that overplayed sophestication of Pearce Brosnan too. Craig's Bond is thuggishly powerful, passionate, sometimes naive with a definite tinge of working-class diligence. He is more human. Now you not only appreciate James Bond... you 'feel' for him when he's beaten or betrayed, like I bet you've never done before.The other is the director and screenwriter's calculated use of clichés and adding few changes... which perfectly fits the story and the mood. So at one place Bond says he doesn't even care about his martini shaken or stirred. Even the signature Bond tune is absent throughout the film except for the end credits. And I wouldn't spoil you the other changes but they bring definitely a fresh air to the franchise.I love Eva Green. Here she's again with her mysterious appearance and magical presence. I must say that she's an excellent casting choice for this role.Oh... I was about to end but one more thing: Chris Cornell rocks with his 'You know my name'... one of the best Bond songs ever.",7,0,2,12 December 2006
Rear Window," Multi-dimensional.
","'Rear Window', perhaps one the most eccentric films Hitchcock ever made, is about a war photographer (played with enough passion by James Stewart) who watches the private lives of his neighbors through his rear window all the day as he gets confined to his wheelchair after a leg injury. Now, he gets convinced that one of the neighbors is a murderer. He tries to dig deeper into the matter with a bit help from his socialite girlfriend and his nurse. The story, always told from a single perspective, is quite full of suspense though Hitchcock brilliantly avoids weird plot twists in the end. The ending may seem predictable, but the film manages to keep the suspense on. And there lies the beauty of it.It is not just another spy movie. The film also gives interesting insights of the fifties society. All the neighboring characters represented some portion of the community. The talented musician, the sculptor, the childless couple, the happily married new couple or the sexy ballet dancer -- everybody's lives reflected some part of the photographer's own life and feelings. The film restricts itself in only one set, but that never gets it boring. That's where the brilliance of Hitchcock lies, perhaps.",9,1,4,24 July 2005
Munich," Simply another masterpiece.
","It is quite safe to say that 'Münich' is among the five best movies that Mr. Spielberg made till date. With a topic shockingly relevant even after thirty-three years, Spielberg reaches out to both emotion and judgement of the audience. The main four reasons behind his achievement? The film's screenplay, cinematography, acting and of course his own trademark serious yet visually appealing style of direction.Israel security officer Avner is assigned to conduct a secret government operation to kill eleven Palestinian high officials after eleven Israeli athletes were murdered in 1972 Olympic Games. He gets aided by four teammates with four entirely different characters. They travel to several European and Mediterranean countries in order to do so. The film effectively portrays the basis of so-called modern terrorism and speaks against those who justify it. The biggest achievement of the film is that it doesn't take any side. There is no hero in this film. Avner questions the utility of terrorism and counter-terrorism in the end but only after he carries out his mission.Janusz Kaminski's ever-brilliant cinematography and Spielberg's ideas effectively blend in to generate some unforgettable shots in the history of cinema. Who can forget the dramatic midnight encounter and exchange of words between Avner's team and some Palestinian agents in that old room in Athens? Or when extreme paranoia strikes Avner at a time near the end of the mission? or when he's still haunted by the Munich murders even while having sex with his wife? The use of violence in this film is graphic and shockingly realistic and none of the scenes are actually uncalled for. The film majorly becomes a character study of every different mind related to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Yet the film remains absolutely neutral... almost passive. It doesn't even shout a message like 'Terrorism is bad' or something. One can imply anything from it.Eric Bana plays the role of Avner with great perfection and style. He effectively catches that vital bit of determination of the character behind his gentle and calm demeanor. Geoffrey Rush also deserves much praise as Avner's superior officer in the Government. Daniel Craig and the actress who played Avner's beautiful wife also did well.While Ang Lee's work in Brokeback Mountain is passionate and personal, Spielberg's in 'Münich' is almost hard realism. Spielberg doesn't voluntarily evoke the audience's emotion by exaggerating a particular scene. But who cares? he will surely win more Oscars in upcoming years.",10,4,6,22 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," For a Separate Place in the History of Cinema
","Star Wars.... so simple a name, yet so appropriate, so meaningful, so attractive. This ultimate venture in imagination can not be, and should not be compared with any of other popular sci-fi movies. I don't believe there were any other movies before this where events took place totally outside earth or without its inhabitants. In that sense Lucas created an entirely new world of his own. Got a fine story, containing detailed descriptions of lifestyle, politics (these two things ordinary sci-fi ones lack) and of course, action. Creation of characters are excellent, as they never seemed impossible. As a director and writer, Lucas excels in many ways, such as in cinematography, plot-twist etc. But probably the best thing about this movie is its special effects. so perfect, they hardly seem possible in 1977! To tell the truth, this movie is probably the best in the whole saga, followed closely by 'Attack of the Clones'.",9,0,0,12 January 2003
Gangs of New York," A Complete Movie by Scorsese.
","Analysis of Martin Scorsese's films reveals that like Ridley Scott, Scorsese also is a master of picturesque, artistic violence. 'Gangs of New York' is a movie set in a time when there were enough such materials. In this film violence rules indifferently, as if this is an usual content of an usual movie. Scorsese masterfully used this post-Lincoln era, when cruelism was the badge of the nation.This is also one movie that's historically so perfect.... which is quite evident from superb set and costume designing. Under Scorsese's brilliant direction, cinematography was also magnificient. But what prompts you to watch this movie again and again is the performance of the two lead actors. Both Daniel Day-Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio acted superbly. Day-Lewis delivered undoubtedly his best performance since 'My Left Foot'. His action, his style to hold the daggers, his way to deliver a speech were so original as Bill the Butcher that it's hard to imagine Day-Lewis without those mushtaches. DiCaprio, though not upto his standard, also gave a fairly good performance. But I somehow have a feeling that DiCaprio didn't quite suit into the role. It's not his acting but his looks what perhaps made me feel this way; Not quite hardened, I suppose. Anyway, what he did was fine. Cameron Diaz was not unimpressive too as the pickpocket.The original song 'Hands That Built America' by U2 is a fantastic one. It accurately catches the subtle sad note underneath all the violence in the film. John Williams' score, as usual, probably going to be the best. So, historic storyline, superb acting, brilliant direction, artistic violence, good score and at last, a thoughtful abstract ending sequence. What more can you want? 5/5.",Null,2,4,25 February 2003
Windtalkers," Quite original... not a typical war film.
","There's no point in comparing this movie with any of the great war movies that come in mind easily. This is never like 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Black Hawk Down' that focus mainly on action. This is not also quite like 'We were soldiers' that displays the soldiers' minds and lives as the only theme. And it is again not like 'No man's land' or 'Apocalypse Now' that speak against violence of war and question national leaders etc. Although John Woo has put all these ingredients in little amounts into 'Windtalkers', still perhaps this movie has a theme of its own. And what's that? Racial harmony and blah blah? One can't be sure of that too easily.Now-a-days war movies are based on very interesting story lines that appears small and petty at first but that's where the director's mastery lies. This whole Navajo-Indians-protecting-the-code is such an original idea. I think this is the most gifted feature of the film, its basic idea. It opens the door for showing so many old things in new ways -- racial debate, cultural fusion, brotherhood among soldiers and sacrifice... all of them. A few very good scenes could adorn the movie for that reason (like that harmonica/flute collaboration?)Yet 'Windtalkers' is never a classic. It's hard to believe why. The acting was very good. Adam Beach and Christian Slater are at their bests with a usual Nicholas Cage. The cinematography and effects were also top-class. Still it is not one of the all-time-great war films. Probably the reason behind it is that the sequences are a little bit incoherent. It does not have the pace to make the viewer glued to the seat. Cage is given unnecessary long screen time while the primary character should have been Beach. The story also got very predictable in the end. But these are not necessary criticisms. It is still Woo's one of the best works. Lovers of war movies... typical or atypical... should not miss it. 8/10",8,3,6,23 January 2005
Goodfellas," A classic mobster film.
","This is one hell of a film about the mobsters, based on a true story and coming from one of the great directors of all time. This is about Henry Hill, the narrator of the story, an Irish simple person who gets involved with the Mafia at a very young age and continues his life through it. There is no major plot in this film, just isolated incidents one of which was the turning point of Hill's life. Scorsese, as brilliant as he ever was, shows violence, sex and drugs etc in his own trademark style. And his actors helps him to make this film one of the classics.Robert DeNiro is not present in much of the film, nor his acting leaves too much impression. The three actors who really did their best job here are Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco. I hate to say that most youngsters today don't know too much about Liotta or how talented he was. I asked my younger brother about him and he said, 'The man who did the voice on GTA: Vice City?'. This is partly because Liotta did not get too many big roles after that, especially in recent years. But here he is just brilliant as Hill. It's Pesci's one of the best too. Playing a mad mobster with dark sense of humor wasn't his usual type. And Lorraine Bracco becomes the perfect lead female in such type of films.The film's got smart screenplay and excellent cinematography. And I don't know how many times Scorsese will be denied his Academy recognition. I hate to see a lifetime achievement award as his first Oscar. But things are going like that.",8,123,224,29 March 2005
Cinderella Man," The haunting presentation of a much-told plot.
","A middle-aged man with three kids at home and a wife he forever loved, struggling through tough financial conditions in a society that has played hard on him, becomes a mass hero after his miraculous rise to fame.Yes, I've heard and seen such stories numerous times before. I know how this hero keeps idealism even under extreme poverty, I know what words he speaks when he tells his wife it'll be okay, I've seen how he remembers what he's fighting for every time he's down, I've seen how his faithful and loving wife always provides him support, and I know how common people always casts him as their idol in the struggle through life.Yet, when I see 'Cinderella Man', I shed a couple of tears at two places, I sit tight holding my breath each time Braddock receives a punch, and I clap after the last fight. The passionate work by Ron Howard and the haunting performance by Russell Crowe makes me almost one of the thousand 'ugly Jersey friends' that supported Braddock that night. You know what makes a film great? When you feel like you're a part of it.",10,4,6,10 October 2005
The Island," Better than expected.
","Just another typical special-effects-driven high-adrenaline action thriller from Michael Bay, quite alike the ones he did before. If you like his other films, you'll like this one too; and if you don't, sorry to disappoint you again. There are plenty of loopholes in the story, yet they managed to sustain the viewers' attention even when the film became a cat-and-mouse chase story after only forty minutes. Bay actually does a fine job to change the scenario from time to time to prevent this thing from becoming obviously boring. Still, he had to include some sequences that are indeed silly as the harsh critics keep telling.Well, I'm not going to point out the plot holes or what could have been done because that will ruin the very purpose of this film. This is a film to watch in good theaters, to look at the screen wide-eyed, to mutter a few praises for the marvel of modern CGI and to have a good take on popcorn. This is not a film to think about too much. Bay ensured that. He mixed calculated amounts of everything -- sci-fi, action, comedy, sex, morals. The comedy portions need to be mentioned as they are smartly written and performed well by Steve Buscemi. The dialogues are not as cheesy as I feared. For the acting, Ewan McGregor does a nice job, especially as the creepy Tom Lincoln. Scarlett Johansson gets an easy take here after the films she's done recently.That sums up everything. As a whole this movie fails to stand up as something exceptional. But a lover of Bay's style would definitely love it. I still think of 'The Rock' as Bay's best, but this comes close. It is not a movie to throw all the bad criticism for not being something it's not supposed to be.",7,0,0,30 July 2005
