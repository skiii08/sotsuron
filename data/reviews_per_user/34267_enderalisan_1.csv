Conquest 1453," Yes there are some mistakes but as a result; the movie was awesome
","This movie is the first of its kind. Because of this fact; saying the movie sucks is probably unfair. As a Turkish citizen i'm proud of it. there are some mistakes but as a result; the movie was awesome. And also Conquest 1453 is the best Turkish Movie I ever watched.Special effects are good for the first of its kind. Clothes and place designs are also well. There are some disconnections in the story but it can be ignored i think.And i'd also like to thank Faith Aksoy for creating this project.I liked it, and i recommend it to everyone.This movie can be first brick for the growing Turkish movie industry.",8,14,45,23 February 2012
