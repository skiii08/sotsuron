Gremlins," Good til Violence-as-Comedy ruins it
","Since I was past puberty the first time I saw this & am a LOT older now, maybe I just needed to be 10 yrs old to like this. I LOVE comedy. WACKY comedy. Verbal comedy. Physical comedy. This? Violence-as-Comedy??? I don't get it. It is just stupid & annoying. 4* for the Positives = up until the gremlins take over, it is quite cutesy nostalgic & the gremlins & mogwai are well done. But, the Violence-as-Comedy story??? Keep it. Seriously, it is NOT 'horror'. It is NOT 'comedy'. It is just Violence-as-Comedy. I didn't even finish watching it this 2nd time.",4,1,9,22 August 2017
It," the only horror is how horrific much of the dialogue is
","This Richie, who is the kid from Stranger Things I guess, is supposed to be funny? Not in the least. Who needs bullies? A kid like that would get beat up by his 'friends', if he had any.
What is with all this bullying BS. I went to high-school in the late '70s in a New England town not much bigger than this Derry seems to be. I moved there sophomore year. I was valedictorian. So, I was both 'the new kid' & sort of a nerd. I witnessed & experienced roughly zero 'bullying' in high-school & absolutely nothing like in IT. Being the valedictorian, I also knew well the nerdiest kids in my class. We were well-adjusted, non-bullied people. WTF planet is S King from?
Another problem: there really is no plot here. It is as if someone took The Goonies and forced them to go into the Haunted House at the amusement park. That is it. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!!
Another problem: as in Stranger Things, which I gave up on early in Season 2, it is as if the parents don't exist & the kids have (as the french say) un IQ d'huitre.
Speaking of un IQ d'huitre, shame on me for redboxxing this. 'Horror' films, at least modern 'horror' films, are generally meant for people with un IQ d'huitre. I saw rave reviews & decided to give this a shot. FOOLED AGAIN! Another 'horror' film meant for people with un IQ d'huitre.",3,1,6,20 February 2018
Green Room," As Boring As They Come
","All those words fans use to describe this (excilerating, tense, etc etc) lasted about 15 minutes after the real violence started. After that, it became excruciating, terrible, etc etc ... plain old monotonous. It is also almost as s...l...o...w as Blue Ruin, though Blue Ruin is a far better movie. A bit of the dialogue between Yelchin & Potts was the main redeeming feature here. One last thing, wasn't it hilarious that Yelchin, who discussed being lousy at paintball, became a true marksman when he got a pistol in his hand? Doh!!! He has a mangled arm. He hasn't slept in 20 - 24 hours. He admits to not being good with a gun. But, DANG, he never misses with that pistol ... clean head-shots at 20 yards. None of the people who carry guns all the time were half as accurate as Yelchin was. Hilarious writing.",3,7,17,30 June 2017
Cloverfield," Enjoyable but with 3 caveats
","3. The opening strongly implies that most or all of the main characters will die before the film ends. That kills a lot of the suspense. I know some people feel more strongly about it, because those people think they need to 'care about' the characters to enjoy a film. I don't need that. As long as the characters aren't vicious or completely stupid or annoying, I can still enjoy the film. 2. Speaking of ANNOYING characters, the guy who ended up 'narrating' much of the film, Hud, is one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen. Hud may be the MOST ANNOYING character ever, who was above the age of 14 & not constantly screaming. 1. The level of idiocy of the guy going up to ?Central Park South? to rescue his 'girlfriend' is hard to comprehend. His odds? Zilch. His payoff. Nada. Listen, by the time he made that decision, it was obvious NYC was history. Go to Tokyo. Find yourself a nice Japanese girl. Seriously. Get the heck out of there. You know that chick is going to be super-high maintenance & she has already shown that she is happy to shove $&!# down your throat.",5,0,2,14 October 2017
Sleepy Hollow," Visuals great. All else, yawn at best
",I'll give 4* for the visuals & Depp's typical affectations ... um ... acting. Everything else is a yawn at best. The dialogue is dumb. The back-story is BS. The thing moves as slow as molasses. The tone shifts between horror & comedy do not work. At all. The 'Oh Look! More RED Blood!' is so over-used that it makes an intelligent person just shake his/her head. And how the heck did Sleepy Hollow NY turn into fog-bank central? That is just another layer of DUMB layered on this. But Burton fanboys go weak in the knees ... and the head.,4,0,5,1 September 2017
The Hateful Eight," Not bad but utterly pointless
","Tarantino gave us a western-who-is-gonna-do-it version of 'Clue' or 'And Then There Were None' or something in that genre with spaghetti-western proclivities thrown in. Somehow, the Tarantino sycophants & fanboys think that is a good thing. Actually, they appear to think it is a great thing. I never ranked Tarantino sycophants up in the same ozone as Nolan sycophants, but anyone who rates this above a '7' is in that category.
Or, maybe, I don't get it because I never flunked out of film-school.
ps: did she really get a Best Supporting Actress nomination? Ridiculous. Her overacting was about as annoying as anything Jack Nicholson ever slopped out.",4,4,10,6 December 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," good movie PLUS you can watch with your kids. Thumbs up BUT
","I have to say the screenplay/plot was a mish-mash. Did they just throw a bunch of Tintin stuff together? The character 'motivations' & the plot contrivances were also weak. In the end, they find what they find basically by accident. Uh huh. The bad guy lived in the house for who knows how long and he never found the 'secret room'. But Tintin & Snowy spend 20 minutes in the house & 'VOILA!' The actions of the butler & who exactly he IS were also just 'VOILA!' And if you're feeling hungry, wait til the Crane Scene & then take a few minutes. You wont miss anything.oh yeah, what was with the tank in the hotel? again 'VOILA!'",8,1,3,12 May 2012
Spider-Man: Homecoming," good enough that I'll watch the next one BUT
","This is WAY BELOW the first couple of Sam Raimi and Tobey Mcguire films. The writing is far worse. The villain is almost a joke. I guess he is supposed to be an evil, amateurish version of T Stark & I'll guess that we will see him & his daughter in another film someday. If not, WOW, they did NOTHING with that character. And, they seemed to make the fight scenes as slapdash as possible since this spideyboy doesn't even know how to fight.Other problem: this spidey is kind of a goofy teen but when he tells Stark about some guy selling weapons with alien technology to criminals, you would hope that Stark would do something more than 'tell the FBI'. But NOPE. that is all Stark did. Well, I guess in this spidey world, the FBI may be better than the real clowns who became Obama's political operatives and lost all credibility & competence.btw, most of the 7 pts is for giving RD Jr screen time & using 3 great late-70s/eraly-80s songs.",7,1,3,19 October 2019
Doctor Strange," Kaecilius vs Voldemort? Steel cage. Winner?
","Not bad. Some funny stuff but many groaners. Much FX stolen from Inception's cutting-room floor. I have to laugh how they made a film filled with pseudo-pan-Asian mysticism & taking place partly in Katmandu but had only 1 Asian (born in England actually) in anything like a lead role. And if you start singing Seger's Katmandu to yourself, just wait for the payoff. Confession; for years, I thought the lyrics were 'Howard the duck & Dr. Strange both stayed' So, this one is for you Chrissie: 'Howard the duck & Dr. Strange both stayed. Trapped in a world that they never made. But not me baby. I'm too precious.' And you know the rest.",5,1,3,23 August 2017
Empire of the Sun," Fighter jets as Sex Toy
","Did you know a 13 yr old Christian Bale had his first orgasm by watching fighter jets? He plays a dufus british kid who worships Japanese zeros, kamikaze pilots, and, most strangely of all, a wimpy grifter played by Malkovich. Joe Pantolino adds flavor & Ben Stiller adds head-shaking 'Huh?'. Oh, & a used-to-be-cute middle-aged, married british woman gets wet whenever she sees the 13 yr old Bale. Those were the days. Spielberg wraps it all up with lots of big pieces of oppressed Chinese running around in the beginning & lots small pieces of oppressed british milling around in the middle & lots of rising suns & setting suns & Bale idol-worshipping random nonsensical things throughout.
If you ignore the script & the details of the story, it is a well-made film. Otherwise, 'Huh?'
And don't forget: Eat Your Weevils. If you don't eat your weevils, how can you have any pudding?",5,4,12,7 April 2019
Gone Baby Gone," Almost. Worst. Ending. Ever.
","The 'mom' was not fit take care of anything but a raging trouser-snake. C Affleck is always tedious & in this he was a moron & a joke. That loser would have never had a decent girlfriend. Instead, he would have been chopped to bits by some gangbanger years before. I'll give Lehane a pass for the over-the-top plot. That is what authors of sensationalist fiction do. Most of the main cast was great. Direction OK.",4,0,6,3 September 2017
Baby Driver," High-body-count, gangster romance. Confused film.
","The action / chases are good and it is entertaining. On the other hand, the idea of Spacey as some scary boss has never made much sense, the romance is awkward, and the whole 'soundtrack to life' schtick gets annoying, esp since most of the songs are played for too short a time or just too hard to hear over the front-ground noise.",5,2,4,20 February 2020
Dunkirk," almost as over-rated as The Dark Knight Rises
","Where do I begin? I highly anticipated watching this. I guess part of that was that I forgot that it was Nolanized. Had I remembered that, I may have expected such a loud, incoherent montage of ... well ... very little. They should have called it 'What I did during Dunkirk, dearie', because that is nearly all it is. It is 'Dunkirk' from the view of a few people, who eventually interact with each other. The problem? Other than (maybe) the old guy with his boat, these people are entirely forgettable. Thus is the fate of this film.The best thing I can say that it is better than The Dark Knight Rises, which was a loud, incoherent montage of moronic merdre.",3,0,4,19 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," Make a crappy movie about a crappy movie
","This is what Hackneyedwood has come to.
Make a crappy movie about the making of a crappy movie.
No wait. It gets worse.
Make a crappy movie about the making of a crappy movie & have people slobbering over how great it is.
This is what the world has come to.",2,9,22,12 March 2018
The Lion King," I had a heart attack 15 minutes into watching this
","I ODed on the syrupy Circle of Life. After leaving the hospital & watching more I realized TLK is really Mission: Impossible - Lion Style in disguise.
Simba replaces Tom Cruise.
Zazu the bird replaces Simon Pegg.
Nala replaces Julia Stiles or another M:I actress
Scar, the nasty uncle, replaces the Head of The Syndicate.
Hyenas replace all The Syndicate henchmen.
and so on & so on.",4,2,9,22 December 2019
Lord of War," High on style. Low on intelligence or depth.
","From the opening sequence showing a bullet approach the head of an 'innocent'* African child to the entire slap-dash, never mind the details, narrative given by Nick Cage, there is roughly zero honesty here. It is typical Hackneyedwood 'narrative'.*How an 'innocent' 'child' comes to be the only person standing in the middle of a gun battle is best left to low-IQ imaginations of people who believe in films like this.ps: said 'innocent' 'child' was shown from the neck up. Panning back would have shown the rocket launcher he was holding. DUH!!!",3,2,7,13 August 2017
The Sixth Sense," 'They don't know they're dead.'
","I'm a fan of the film, but the famous line should be 'They don't know they're dead.' not 'I see dead people.' How can they not know they're dead? Nobody will talk to them. The few people who can see them scream & run away. How can they not know they're dead? Why is that important? well, the entire 'twist' relies on tricks like having Willis & the mom sitting in a room together, a few feet away from each other. Well, the mom obviously did not invite him there & obviously did not let him in & obviously did not interact with him while he was there. So, HOW CAN HE NOT KNOW HE IS DEAD????????? Still, well done. Just not cohesive.",9,0,2,14 October 2017
What We Do in the Shadows," Hilarious. See it. Full Stop.
","They're all great. Viago is the best. I'm not sure when was the last time I saw a better comedic performance in a Hackneywood film ... a LONG time ago. Speaking of Hackneywood, this film further corroborates that Hackneywood & France now make the worst films in the world. Hackneywood's formula of preachy PC BS has become so rigor(mortis)ous that most of its films stink & even its best films have a bit of a stench to them. Indian, Russian, Kiwi, etc films with low-budgets make you say 'Oh, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!'Screw Hackneywood.",9,2,6,25 June 2017
Spectre," Starts well but turns into farce almost
","Still, it is Bond (Bond-paint-by-numbers)& Craig and Fiennes (is that his name) are both good, so a '6'. Opening is above avg Bond opening and car chase is great. The problem is that pretty much everything about Blofeld is silly. The story, the acting, the stupid banter/insults while torturing, the surviving a huge explosion looking like he was in a sword-fight ... all silly. I loved Waltz in a couple of films, but he plays Blofeld like he plays every other character & almost ruins the last half of the film.",6,0,7,24 June 2017
