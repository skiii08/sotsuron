The Blair Witch Project," Scary
","It is hard to believe that a low budget horror film like this can actually deliver the goods: to scare viewers. In a time when special effects seem to be the most important aspect of movies, Blair Witch Project offers something different. It is one of those rare movies which can make people inside a theater be quiet. When I saw it, everyone inside the theater was quiet during the scary scenes. When was the last time that happened?Blair Witch can be compared to an Italian movie named Cannibal Holocaust; they both have something in common: they are about people who disappear, and then their footage is found. Yet Cannibal Holocaust wasn't scary at all. Blair Witch is a good horror movie.Of course, there are many people who won't like it. If you are expecting special effects or a typical horror movie, then you are probably one of the many people who will hate this one. Those who want to be scared, well, that's a different story.",Null,1,1,27 August 1999
The Mummy," An okay adventure movie
","This isn't exactly a great movie. But if you like adventure films, it might be worth the money you paid for it. However, I don't think this is a horror film at all. Nothing here is scary.I never got bored while watching this film. A few parts of the plot and a few scenes were totally ridiculous. The movie does manage to entertain you with action sequences and special effects.Just expect a good adventure movie; not a great horror film.",Null,0,0,15 October 1999
Lost in Translation," Definitely not empty. Definitely boring
","Lost in Translation starts really well. A movie about an actor that once enjoyed a lot of popularity, but now he is aging and must settle for a job in Japan advertising a new wine brand. A movie about a woman whose marriage is shallow. Her husband doesn't really care about her. Then during the movie she meets the aging actor and their lives suddenly become exciting.
Lost in Translation is about how people are the same no matter what language or culture they have. It is a movie about two people whose lives are empty, but they find in each other what they need despite their differences.
This film, although it may seem great, could have been put in a short story. The plot can be summed up in less than fifty lines. You could study any tourist that goes to any country and make a movie about the experiences of that person, and it would be as good as this. After the first twenty minutes, Lost in Translation becomes a boring episode of anyone's life during a trip to any country. Even the funny moments aren't special at all. The things we see in Lost in Translation can happen to anyone during a week.One thing this movie has that makes other people like it is the fact that they identify themselves with the characters having fun. However if your idea of having fun is not, and I repeat myself 'is not', going to bars, playing video games, singing karaoke songs and having an affair, Lost in Translation is as entertaining as fixing a broken chair.",Null,1,2,21 February 2004
The Bourne Identity," One of the best films of 2002
","Bourne Identity is definitely Robert Ludlum's best novel. But can it translate well into a good film? After watching films like Sphere (based on the Michael Crighton novel by the same name) and Queen of the Damned (based on the Anne Rice novel) and after enduring all the films loosely based on Dean R. Koontz's great novels, I can say I wasn't expecting much out of Bourne Identity. Fortunately Bourne Identity proves that not all films taken out of grandiose novels turn out to be mediocre entertainment.  In the novel, the terrorist Carlos is the enemy.  Needless to say that had to be changed-Carlos is in jail now.  If you read the book, you will realize that a lot of chapters were simply skipped.  There was no option.  If the movie had had every chapter from the novel put into the film, it would have lasted more than four hours-just like the miniseries by the same name that came out in 1988. Despite all the changes made to the movie, despite all the deviations from the original story (some of them rather risky), Bourne Identity is a great film.Matt Damon is definitely a great actor.  And his good acting doesn't fail to disappoint here.  And Franka Potente makes a great sidekick. She is far from being the typical Hollywood good actress.  And this role was definitely for her.  In one movie scene, you will see Matt Damon cutting her hair.  Then she dyes it.  This woman colored her hair blond once.  Then she shaved it all.  Now she is letting a man with amnesia give her a haircut.  She just can't stop doing things to her hair. Not that it bothers me. Nothing about this actress is annoying. She was impressing in Run Lola Run, and she continues to be. Same thing can be said about Matt Damon. He was great in The Talented Mr. Ripley, and he was perfect for the role of Jason Bourne, an agent suffering from amnesia who must find out who and what he is, and the more he learns about himself, the more in danger he gets.Bourne Identity is far from being the typical spy film. Here there are no amazing, hard to believe gadgets that seem to come out of James Bond films. Here there are no amazing explosions that seem more like advertisement for good pyrotechnic companies than parts of any film. It is just a good suspense story equipped with believable action.This is a movie every fan of the genre should see.",Null,1,2,30 January 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Perhaps it is misunderstood
","I have already criticized this film, and I am afraid that I was probably too harsh with it.My comments may be saturated with spoilers, so read at your own risk.There are several reasons why this film may work, but most of them are so hidden you have to think about them very carefully. First of all, we have the end of the film. At the end of the film, we see a new dawn, and we see the Oracle and the Architect talking. This new dawn symbolizes the beginning of a new Matrix, where humans and androids can co-exist and anyone is free to leave. The fact that Neo stays in the machine world means he will now control it or help to control it. He and Agent Smith were total opposites, good and evil. And Neo won the battle. The fact that Neo loses his eyes allowed him to see the machines in a new way, a beautiful way, which tells us that they weren't that bad to begin with. The conversation Neo has with two programs before that train arrives tells us that these machines feel emotions as well, and they are alive. The problem with the Matrix Revolutions begins with the fact that the war to save Zion lasted way too long and had too many bullets flying and too many characters fighting, and none of these characters were well developed, so we don't care if they live or die. Neo and Trinity disappear from the film almost completely during this war. To make things worse, Trinity dies. She should have stayed in Zion and stay alive. Another problem is Agent Smith. How was he defeated? Did the Oracle help? Did the machines help Neo destroy him? And where were all the answers we sought from the previous two films? Were they trapped in a second matrix? Was all this a game that Neo figured out how to end? I guess we should find the answers ourselves. The problem is that there are too many possible answer.",6,0,0,6 November 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," What was this?
","Before you read, let me warn you that my comments will be full of spoilers.
The Matrix Revolutions appears to be a good installment in this trilogy called The Matrix. The special effects are there, the Martial Arts are there, and of course, those conversations riddled with philosophical messages are there.But the Matrix soon starts to decompose into just another piece of celluloid. By the time the war between men and machine begins, this movie is almost impossible to follow. We see nothing but special effects assaulting our eyes as the Sentinels enter the city of Zion. Bullets fly,  the city is being destroyed, and for more than just a few minutes, Neo (the main character) is nowhere to be seen.And here come the spoilers:Neo decides to negotiate a truce between man  and machine just when the machines seem to be winning. How? By promising the machines he will defeat Agent Smith. At this point, more than a few characters we care for have lost their lives, and I am sure people want to see a happy ending, and there can be no happy ending when some of the characters we care for are dead.
The movie ends in a way that makes absolutely no sense. Because men and machine cannot co-exist. I won't elaborate. But it is obvious to me that this is not a true ending.",6,0,0,5 November 2003
Van Helsing," Shallow adventure movie
","Van Helsing seems to have been written by the same screenwriter who wrote The League of Extraordinary Men. That movie had a lot of characters we are all familiar with (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, etc) as the good guys. Van Helsing, on the other hand, has werewolves and vampires as the bad guys. This film may be better than League of Extraordinary Men. But its flaws don't allow it to be a good movie either.Caution: the following may contain spoilers.The first problem comes from the fact that most of the battles between Van Helsing and the evil vampires are simply repetitive. The female vampires battle against Van Helsing and his friends, and they are defeated. After a few minutes, the vampires come back for more. They are defeated. People start to get bored because they are overwhelmed with a sense of deja-vu. Dracula brings his offspring back to life. Then they die. Later in the movie, he brings more offspring back to life again. We are just getting more of the same stuff. Another problem is cheesy dialogue. Most of it comes from the female vampires. All these problems are  nothing compared to the disappointing ending you are going to see.  The visual effects are great in this movie. It seems that every time a movie is short on plot, Hollywood glosses over this shortcoming by saturating it with the most beautiful special effects money can buy. But not even that can stop you from getting bored before the movie reaches its climax.",5,0,1,6 May 2004
Dark City," Excellent film
","This movie is very unusual. It is a mixture of a classical film noir with a science fiction film. Great special effects, great acting. Despite having a rather complicated plot, it is never difficult to follow.
There are some similarities to the Matrix. Both Neo and John Murdoch save the people of the world they live in. They both have superpowers. And they are both in a world that is controlled by non-human entities. But that's pretty much where the similarities end. Despite lacking the martial-art sequences of the Matrix, I believe Dark City is a better film all the way.
This one will leave you with pleasant memories, and they will be yours to keep. Not injected into you by Kiefer Sutherland.",10,0,2,3 July 2000
Independence Day," Science Fiction or Stupid Fiction?
","My comments are full of spoilers:But by now, everyone has probably seen this.ID4 begins with a mistake and ends with a mistake. First of all, there's no air on the moon. Thus when the ship is flying over the Moon, it shouldn't lift dust or even make a noise. Yet it did. Watch the opening of this film.Why did S.E.T.I (Search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence) detect a signal? What kind of signal were the aliens sending? Did they notify the Earth that they were coming?Why were they using the Earth's satellites to communicate? Weren't they positioned around the globe already? They didn't need the Earth's satellites.If the satellites were unreliable, how come the USA communicated with squadrons around the world? What did Jeff Goldblum mean when he said 'Checkmate' to his work partner? Did he mean that the aliens were planning to take away the Earth's King? Hmm.Wil Smith knocks out an alien with a punch. Then that same alien kills five people in a lab. How come nobody thought about punching it again?
The aliens had no vocal cords, but they made sounds when they were shot at.
What was the degree of the doctor in Area 51? He performed autopsies, fixed alien ships... I guess he's one of those multiple degrees people that are so rare to find. Etc, etc, etc. My favorite mistake here is the virus thing. How did David (Jeff Golblum) bring down the shields with a virus? Did the aliens use Mac computers too? Or did David know the computer language of the aliens? And computer viruses won't work unless the aliens run them. Did any alien run the virus David sent? And even if the ship got infected with a virus, how come even the small ships on the Earth got infected? Ridiculous. The writers of this movie had created an enemy (The Aliens) that couldn't be defeated. Plain and simple. Thus what they did was wrapping the movie up with something that is technically impossible. And when Wil Smith and Jeff Goldblum are inside the small ship, the blinders opened. Wil Smith says, 'What the hell are you doing?' Jeff replies, 'It is not me; they are overriding the system.' If the aliens were able to override the system of a small ship, how come they weren't able to get rid of the virus or override the virus and raise all the shields again?And the movie ends with the huge ship falling out of the sky. Remember when the aliens arrived the Secretary of Defense suggested targeting the ship and blowing it out of the sky? What did the general say? Here it is:You risk turning one big falling object into many.Well, that's what they did at the end of the movie: they turned one big falling object into many. That's more than enough to destroy humanity right there. That explosion and the aftermath were enough to create nuclear winter. Those are the science mistakes. Now let's see the movie genre mistakes: it was supposed to be a science fiction film. After the alien attacks, it turns into a drama film. For a few minutes, I fell I was watching 'The Day After'.The characters were stupid. The President spent the whole movie with a smile on his face. They seemed to be detached from the fact that they were being exterminated. Most of the characters here were completely unbelievable.This film didn't need the whole patriotism thing. The main message of this movie seems to be this: don't mess with the USA. Plain and simple.",Null,0,0,15 August 2000
Event Horizon," 2010 meets Hellraiser, and the outcome is bad!
","Event Horizons begins as a great movie. Great special effects.The entire environment in which the movie is set is great.At first, Event Horizon appears to be a 2010 clone. A bunch of astronauts are going to rescue a ship that disappeared many years ago.
Caution: spoilers ahead.But the movie evolves into a B-horror film. The crew finds out that the Event Horizon ship is possessed. And while this happens, Dr. Weir, the scientist of the crew, tries to explain everything rationally.And how comes the ship got possessed? Because it traveled into a black hole created by scientists. The movie makes you understand that science created the horror the crew is enduring. And as bad as this is, it is the scientist of the crew who, for some unexplained, reason turns into the bad guy. The only conclusion I can draw is that this film is anti-science. And the scientist turning bad is simply a symbol of that.This movie doesn't know what to be. It starts like a science fiction movie. Turns into a horror movie. First, it makes you believe that the ship is reacting to them and wants them to leave. Then, when they want to leave, the ship doesn't want them to leave.Bottom line: it doesn't make any sense.",Null,0,1,28 June 2000
Army of Darkness," One of the Coolest Horror Movies Out There
","This is one of those movies that didn't do well at the Box-office. But most of the people who have seen this movie have loved it. Dialogues, although cheesy sometimes, are funny. Most of the movie is very funny. It is like a horror cartoon.Even if the plots are different, I compare this movie to 'Killer Klowns from Another Space'. They are similar; they don't take themselves seriously. And they are very cool.",Null,1,1,15 October 1999
Signs," An overrated insult to the intelligence
","There are many movies out there that are extremely overrated. Sixth Sense, a masterpiece by writer-director M. Night Shyamalan, was overrated; it was good but not that good; it had many holes in the plot. However, when it comes to being overrated, Signs is in a category all by itself.Take away Mel Gibson and replace him with an unknown actor, and this is a B-movie. Take away the popularity of the man who directed it, and this film would have been as easily forgotten as Xtro and Not Like Us. The popularity that Sixth Sense enjoyed gave Signs one hell of a boost. The fact that Signs has a few scary scenes has swindled people into thinking this is a masterpiece when it comes to horror flicks.The movie is about a group of aliens making crop circles around a farmer's cornfield. Later in the film, we find out that these aliens, who so far are behaving like pranksters from outer space, are planning to invade Earth. Apparently making crop circles is their idea of warning people that an attack is coming. Imagine American troops tracing crop circles around Iraqi farms, and you get the picture.One of Signs' scariest moments takes place when a group of kids at a birthday party see an alien walking down the street. The shocking footage is filmed by someone at the birthday party. Horrifying indeed. But if you use a little logic, you immediately realize that the alien is walking around naked and without weapons. So they are planning to invade Earth naked and weaponless? Suddenly bigfoot seems a little scarier, and the aliens in Independence Day, who were dumb enough to not know about antivirus software, seem a lot smarter.Spoilers ahead, and I mean real spoilers:Eventually the invasion begins. This is the point where an alien breaks into Mel Gibson's farm. Yes, attacking farms is an alien's idea of a planetary war; it seems the aliens are in desperate need of corn. But Mel Gibson and his family are going to fight back. They get in the cellar and lock the door. Apparently these aliens can travel faster than light, but they don't have firearms, and they are afraid of locked, wooden doors.Then, early in the morning, the alien seems to be gone. It seems the alien is afraid of sunlight. When the family, who has been through one hell of an ordeal, turns on the television, they realize that not just one but all of the aliens are gone. Why? Because humans discovered that water can harm them. Yes, water can harm them. Yet they were stupid enough to walk around naked. Imagine a group of nudists hanging around a lava-marinated volcanic eruption, and you get the logic of this.The scariest thing about Signs is the fact that not even movie critics saw all the holes it has.",2,1,1,29 December 2003
X2: X-Men United," Great superhero movie
","Many people disagree with me, but I believe the first X-Men had many shallow characters. This movie, however, introduced characters like Nightcrawler, Ice-Man, that, even if they were mutants, you could see as people and not just actors getting paid for being part of a film. X2 was full of new ideas and great action sequences, like the two warplanes being chased by tornadoes. The action is great in this film, but it gives you time to breath (if you don't understand watch the Peacemaker, and you will see action that never stops to the point where you just get bored). The bottom line, X2 is a great film.",Null,0,0,13 May 2003
