Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," so bad that it lowers the score on the first 3
","I will keep this short and sweet.  This movie is terrible.  It completely alienates about all the fans from the original trilogy, and simply aims at selling new toys/video games to children.  The only people I found who weren't completely appalled with Jar Jar Binks were kids under the age of 12(young kids love him for some reason).  Hey Lucas, thanks for explaining what the force is!!!!  Way to make good actors look like hacks!!!!  And this thing took 16 years to come up with???  I don't think there is one redeeming quality about this movie.A solid 1 out of 10.",1,0,1,30 June 2001
