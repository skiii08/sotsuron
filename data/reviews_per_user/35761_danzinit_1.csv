The Benchwarmers," Really funny movie, the whole theater was cracking up
","This movie had a lot of the typical humor you'd expect from the three leads. May be typecasting John Heder a bit too much but he's good at the part he plays. Actually has a sweet story line. I went with my boyfriend and another couple and both the guys and the girls really enjoyed the movie and neither side was really offended by the humor. Be warned however, there are three different places in the movie where vomiting is involved(just for the funny effect it has on a situation). For anyone with a weak stomach, look away! I actually was pleasantly surprised with the minimal swearing in this movie when you consider who the cast is and who produced it (Happy Madison). Anyway, I thought it was a really good movie and would definitely recommend it.",9,68,113,10 April 2006
