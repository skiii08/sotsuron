Marie Antoinette," Is this the latest fad
","I have bought Marie Antoinette and I wonder if there is something wrong with my DVD. All heads seem to be cut, and you are lucky if you get to see the lower chin to identify people. Even if I try to change the format of the film, heads are cut anyway. Is it supposed to be that way? I would have complained immediately to the seller if I were not a publisher and have been told that from 2003 cutting heads in pictures was the ultimate fashion. When our designer made our book on a well known ballet dancer, she cut hands and the top of heads. I corrected this practice since hand movements are very important in ballet. There are some fashions I will not succumb to, for example cutting my husband's penis with the ultimate designer's scissors or crushing his balls with the last designer triumph of a hammer. Either there is something wrong with my DVD or Sophia Coppola is very chic and modern. Please tell me which explanation to act on: Should I ask for another DVD without flaws, or shall I watch the film closely once more because I am too old-fashioned to understand true art?",3,1,2,5 January 2008
