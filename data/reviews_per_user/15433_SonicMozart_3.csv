Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A must see
","I own the DVD, and just now I watched it for the second time. And I find it even better than the first time I watched it (if that's even possible). Now I got to notice a lot of little details that I didn't saw the first time. And all scenes, both action and dramatical ones, are just perfect. I really liked the first movie, and this volumen 2 is just as perfect as vol. 1, but on its own right. It's very different from the first movie, and there, I think, lies its value and the genius of it all. It is not a xerox copy of the first movie. Both movies are perfect on their own manner. I've noticed most people who don't like vol. 2, is because of it lack of action scenes. Well, that's a plus for me. Tarantino, the genius that he is, didn't try to repeat the same formula, creating just a clone.., he took the plot to a whole new level, where we can see the characters' development and depth. And the few actions scenes.... well... they are incredible. I'm just sad the story ended....",10,0,1,12 September 2004
The Nightmare Before Christmas," BEAUTIFUL MUSIC!
","I keep reading wonderful reviews about this movie, but most of them say that the music is not as good.Well, I have to disagree. For you, music lovers, that truly appreciate good music, you HAVE to see this movie, the music is fantastic! Danny Elfman did a wonderful work here. Maybe (and obviously) it is not the typical catchy Hollywood soundtrack and songs.Here, you will find very elaborated scores and arrangements, with fantastic details, and the songs are very well performed. do your self a favor, watch this movie! Or at least, get the soundtrack CD.",Null,0,1,24 October 2002
The Fountain," Overly complicated movie
","Well, I just saw this movie, and I didn't like it.I don't understand the idea of someone being stupid just because he didn't like this movie, that you need 'great' skills and mind to understand it. Anyway, MY reasons for not liking this movie are: 1. Extremely complicated for no reason. And I don't mean complicated as in you need to think a lot to understand the plot. I mean in the sense the story had too many distractive elements that didn't add up nothing to the plot, only confused me. It was very pretty to watch, all the colors and FXs, but at some points I didn't know what in the friggin hell was going on. Just like in 'requiem for a dream', which I didn't like either (for different reasons though). I DID understand the plot at the end (my vision, at least), and that only reassured my thought that this is one big MTV's music video: great visuals, but with a very simple story that run too long for almost 2 hours. 2. The music. Don't get me wrong, the music was beautiful. But it played almost ALL the time. Again, it seems this director wanted to make a 2 hours music video. It felt as if he couldn't make scenes strong enough, as if images couldn't speak for themselves without background music all the time. That's a flaw, in my opinion. All in all.. if you enjoyed 'requiem for a dream', I'm SURE you'll enjoy this movie.",5,0,3,17 June 2007
