Requiem for a Dream," The first film I have given 10/10 on IMDb.
","This is hands down one of the best films I have seen, after recently watching it for the 3rd time, I felt compelled to write a review for this movie. This is a brutal, honest, and terrifying depiction of the effects of drug abuse, centered around 4 characters.The cinematography in this film is AMAZING. The four lead roles all give excellent performances, I was surprised with Marlon Wayans acting skills in this movie, he was terrific.This movie possible shows what most drug users go through on a day to day basis, I'm one who has never taken drugs, and possible never will, but after watching this movie I will can say I will NEVER EVER take drugs. This film is required viewing for 11 yr old school children (apart there are some scenes of nudity/swearing).And the soundtrack is one of the best I have heard.A MUST SEE!!! 10/10",10,1,2,22 December 2005
Face_Off," GOOD ACTION FLICK
","After a few disappointing films (Blackjack, Broken Arrow, and Hard Target) John Woo has finally warmed up to a spectacular film, on par with the likes of the brilliant Hard Boiled and excellent The Killer.The story may be a little over the top with an FBI agent swapping faces with a seemingly dead terrorist to find a location of a bomb, but the action comes in bucketloads and it's not a case of quality over quantity as John Woo uses his excellent directorial skills to make one of the best action movies ever.",8,0,0,29 April 2001
Final Destination," VERY GOOD
","This has to be one of the best horror/thrillers I have seen. The story is quite original and the film is absolutely full of suspense.
Films like The Sixth Sense, What Lies Beneath, etc didn't make me jump at all, but Final Destination kept my heart pounding right to the end.",7,0,2,29 April 2001
Gladiator," EXCELLENT
","This film is absolutely incredible, it is 3 hours of some of the best direction and choerography I have seen.The fight scenes are amazing and I would strongly recommend that you watch this on the feature-packed DVD.",9,0,0,29 April 2001
