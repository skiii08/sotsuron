Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas has definitely done it again!
","Lucas has done it again. It's been 16 years since we've been to that galaxy far, far away. The wait was well worth it. It takes place a generation before the first Star Wars movie. Things that I loved about this movie were: The mind boggling special effects; the spectacular action scenes; Jar Jar Binks' witty dialogue; excellent acting by Neeson, McGregor, Portman and Lloyd; the return of Yoda, C-3PO, R2-D2, Palpatine, and Jabba; the return to Tatooine, the stunning views of Naboo and Coruscant; the pod racing scene; the scene where Anakin stands before the Jedi Council; the space and the Gungan battle; the fight scene with Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul; the emotional mixture you get at the end of the film. I think the reason critics didn't like this movie is that they don't sit through and just watch, they look for the flaws. I didn't see any that I thought could be held against the movie. This movie was definitely worthy of the title Star Wars. It was truly the movie of the year, or perhaps the decade, or century. Oh well you get the idea. Vote for this movie and please get it within the top 100 or at least let it surpass the South park movie. 11/10",10,0,0,21 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A visual and emotional masterpiece!
","I would consider this movie the greatest movie of the decade and after the original trilogy the greatest film of all time. This film brought back the special galaxy that we haven't visited in 16 years and gives us a whole new look at it. There was no Luke Skywalker, no Princess Leia, no Han Solo, but in their place we were given new unforgettable characters such as Anakin Skywalker, Queen Amidala, and Qui-Gon Jinn. And I don't think I could make a good review without mentioning Jar Jar Binks. Come on, he was a cool character. I mean for all of you out there who keep saying you hate him, don't you have anything better to do than make fun of an imaginary character.Moving on, the key thing that held this movie together was the story. Good v.s. Evil is the main theme here. That's was Star Wars always was.Another thing that made this movie work were it's astounding visual and sound effects and how could I forget John Williams' fantastic score. I'm shocked that this did not get an Oscar nomination. The final battle will get your emotions up to full strength until the end of the movie and the music helps do it. Another thing that stood out in this movie was Natalie Portman. Aside from being extremely beautiful she was also very talented in her role as the Queen of Naboo. I really loved her work.All in all, this movie was the greatest since Return of the Jedi, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching a great movie. Way to go, George!",10,0,1,27 February 2000
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Another classic Lucas movie.
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is no doubt a classic. George Lucas is a genius. First he made the Star Wars movies(the greatest movies ever made.) and then he created Indiana Jones. And to make matters better he had the directorial power of Steven Spielberg behind him. The two of them make the greatest team.The world is in the midst of World War II. Indiana Jones(Harrison Ford)is a famous archeologist who has been hired by the government to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do.Things that made this movie great were the acting. Harrison Ford has another legendary character to add alongside Han Solo. Another great thing were the unforgettable moments: the opening scene is now a classic, the bar scene, the scene where Indy shoots the swordsman, and who could forget the awesome conclusion.My hats off to Lucas and Spielberg. 10/10",Null,0,0,20 July 2000
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," My favorite movie...when I was a kid.
","Of course, I had a few favorite movies as a kid, such as The Karate Kid and Batman. But know that I'm older and have more of a keen eye when it comes to viewing movies, I'd say that E.T. was probably the best of them.It had a very charming story of a boy and a lost alien. They develop a friendship with each other and try to get him back to his planet before the government gets him.Now that I think about it, I think the film's greatest asset was John William's moving score. I remember playing this in my high school band and realized how cool it sounded. I also realized from this movie that Steven Spielberg was one of the best directors ever. He created other great films such as Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark. He's done many other great films but E.T., Jaws and Raiders were the best in my opinion.This movie was chock full of memorable scenes such as the flying bike sequence and I would always laugh at the drunken E.T. That was a great scene.Even though this isn't my favorite movie anymore(The Empire Strikes Back takes that trophy. I watched this movie before I saw the Star Wars trilogy.), it will always be known as a classic in my book. Perhaps I should watch it again soon.",Null,0,0,7 June 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen!!!
","And I'm not kiddin'! I can't believe I blew five bucks on it, when I could've seen Star Wars: The Phantom Menace again. This movie was pretty dumb. Once the kids say the F word once, it gets tired and the whole movie goes down the drain. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. If you want to see good workings of Matt Stone and Trey Parker, watch BASEketball and Orgazmo, they are much funnier. Absolutely stupid! 0/10",Null,0,1,17 October 1999
The Fifth Element," Star Wars for Generation X.
","Let me start off by saying that The Fifth Element had to be one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made. In fact, I think that after the four Star Wars movies this was the greatest movie ever. But that's just my opinion.This movie takes place in the distant future where an evil corporation run by a man(at least I think it was a man) named Zorg plots to find four stones that contain the four elements, earth, air, fire, and water and a mysterious fifth element that is in the form of a young woman. When they are brought together it can create an unimaginable power. Then, the young woman falls in the hands of a New York City cab driver. With the help of a priest and a wierd disc jockey(which I think is like a Dennis Rodman of the future) they try to save the world.This movie was great on many accounts including, good performances, great digital design, and an interesting interpretation of the future. Willis was cool and so was Oldman. If you want to see a good sci-fi flick or just a good movie check this one out. 10/10",10,0,1,12 December 1999
The Terminator," A definite action classic!
","This movie, in my opinion, was the first and best action classic (Die Hard, RoboCop and Lethal Weapon are also up there with it). It had interesting characters, dynamite action, one of Hollywood's creepiest villians, and a dark atmosphere you couldn't cut with a machete.It's the story of a future that is controlled by machines as most of civilization was destroyed and only a handful of humans are left to fight them. One of those machines is sent back to 1984 to kill the mother of the leader of the future human resistance. But then a future soldier is sent back with it to protect her.The high points of this movie were:1. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the coolest actor ever, he played the role so believably it was scary.2. The moody atmosphere. When you see it you'll know what I mean.3. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. Two great actors who did a great job in this movie.4. It has one of the greatest movie quotes in history:'I'll be back.'The low points are:1. When you see the movie after a few times the plot starts to seem way too simple. That's why I liked the sequel better.2. It could've used a little comic relief. I couldn't really find any. Except maybe for the scene where Arnold shouted a dirty line at a janitor. Another reason I liked the sequel better.3. Arnold could've used some more dialogue. These low points didn't drag down the movie any though. This movie is classic, no doubt about it. Check it out if you haven't seen it. You won't regret it. 10/10",Null,0,0,11 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Very emotional!
",I was again very impressed by the name Star Wars. And who wouldn't be? This movie had superb effects the third time around and an even more emotional story.I could actually feel the excitement when Luke battled Jabba the Hutt and during the space battles. I also felt great sadness during Yoda's final moments. I also felt an extreme emotional mixture during the ending(Especially in the Special Edition).It continues the destiny of Luke Skywalker as he gradually becomes a Jedi while the Rebel Alliance tends to break the Galactic Empire once and for all. I couldn't think of any story that would go along better with Star Wars.I know some of you didn't like this movie because it seemed too 'cutesy'. So what? It was all in good fun. Isn't that what Star Wars is all about? 11/10,10,1,3,28 October 1999
Scary Movie 2," I thought it was funny.
","I noticed the irony that in the Scream movies they stated that no sequel could surpass the original film. Well, in this case they did.In this movie, Cindy, Ray, Shorty and Brenda from the first film along with some new characters get involved to research an old house that they believe to be haunted. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that it is. Everything that follows is goofy(obviously).I found this movie to be simply delightful. Sure the cat fight and the cursing parrot were annoying and retarded as hell, but lots of other funny stuff and a funny cast make up for it's flaws. I particularly found the Charlie's Angels spoof to be funny, unlike the Matrix spoof in the original. The Wayans brothers, as usual, were funny. I also liked David Cross' character. Funny and enjoyable. 8/10",Null,0,1,6 July 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not a movie for everyone, but definitely a movie for me!!!
","(Some possible spoilers)Ah, Star Wars. Where to start? I'll start off by saying that this movie made it impossible for me to rank the Star Wars movies in order of my favorites, because I love these movies so much.Anakin Skywalker is now a young man who has become the apprentice of Obi-Wan Kenobi. After an assassination attempt on Senator Padme Amidala's life, Anakin is sent to protect her while Obi-Wan tries to solve the mystery of a clone army that was created for the Republic. Anakin starts to fall in love with Padme and the mysterious Count Dooku has started a war with the Republic.Things I loved about this movie? Well, pretty much everything. The effects were great and the battle scenes were great. I also really liked the love story and the clone mystery. I was also very pleased with the performances. Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman(I love you!) are excellent. I love their work in pretty much everything they've done. Hayden Christensen was great too, particularly in the scene with his mother. That was very emotional. Words can't express how cool Sam Jackson was in this. Count Dooku, Jango Fett and Yoda. So many cool characters in this.A few flaws? Nothing too extreme but yes. I personally would've added a few more scenes with the love story, then it would have seemed a little less rushed. That droid factory scene was cool but it wasn't that special. C-3PO's role got a little strange. I liked the lightsaber battle in Episode I better than this. And I would've gave Bail Organa and Jar Jar Binks(yeah, so sue me.)a little more to do.This movie is absolutely excellent. I thought Ep. 1 was a little more fun, but this one wasn't as silly. I love Ep. 1, but I would be lying if I didn't say it did get a little silly. Oh, man. Three more years to wait! 11/10. Long live Star Wars.",10,0,0,25 May 2002
American Pie," mmm...pie!
","This movie had to be one of the funniest movies ever made. This should become a classic. It was last summer's funniest movie. I loved it.
What made it great was the hilarious characters(particularly Stifler and Jim's Dad); the fact that they relied a lot on toilet humor(where would comedy be without it); I also liked the fact that the actors could switch from funny to serious and back again. It had a good story and likeable characters. My favorite scene was when (Warning: possible spoiler) Stifler found Finch and his mom together.If you're willing to choose a raunchy, hilarious movie to watch, this is the one to go for. 10/10",Null,0,0,8 January 2000
Armageddon," 'This is so much fun, it's freaky!'
","Armageddon is one great movie. It has almost everything that makes a good sci-fi movie. And as a die hard(heh heh) sci-fi fan, I found this movie to be very entertaining.Harry Stamper(Willis)and his oil drilling crew have been hired by NASA to drill into an asteroid the size of Texas and destroy it before it strikes Earth and destroys it.Simple? Of course. But this isn't a real thinking movie. The acting isn't as bad as it is said to be. The special effects and action sequences were spectacular. They may have been overused at times but why complain?This movie isn't spectacular sci-fi like Star Wars or The Fifth Element but it's a million times better than horrible sci-fi like Independence Day, Star Trek or this movie's rival Deep Impact, but this isn't a movie to be missed if you like good sci-fi, or just good movies. 9/10",Null,1,1,28 April 2001
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Oh boy, another Terminator!
","Just like everyone else, I had my doubts about this movie. Basically, for the same reasons as everyone else. But damn, this was good.I love the Terminator flicks. I've been a big fan since I was ten. Yeah, my parents weren't too restrictive when it came to the movies I watch. I love action films and I love Arnold. This guy will always be cool to me. I even forgave him for Batman and Robin.This movie was really great. It has a great story, outstanding action and good performances. Hence, it's a Terminator movie. In fact, I don't think I've ever been so impressed by action scenes in some of the more recent movies. Watching that bathroom fight, I started thinking to myself,'You know, I don't care if you are a machine. That had to hurt!' As for the performances, I can't say enough about Arnold. The new character I liked the most was Claire Danes' Kate Brewster. I really felt for her character. Her fear, her grief and her confusion. She really gave a great performance. Nick Stahl was good, even though he looked nothing like the John Connor in the previous film. Kristanna Loken is awesome as the T-X. I didn't think her character would be as ominous as the previous Terminators. I was wrong.If I have any gripes, it's the pacing. This movie just jumped too quickly into the plot and it leaves some questions unanswered. I want to know how Arnold got his shotgun and how he found John and Kate at the beginning. But the ending more than made up for it. It really made me think. In fact, I better turn off my computer now before it's too late! I'll just leave by saying this: They can make as many action movies as they want, but none will ever top the excitement and entertainment of the Terminator series. Bring on T4! 10/10",10,1,2,13 July 2003
BASEketball," One of the funniest movies ever made!
","This movie is probably the best of Trey Parker and Matt Stone.(Orgazmo comes in a close second, and the South Park movie sucked). I recommend this to anyone who loves movies with raunchy humor and lots of sight gags.This movie is about two losers from Milwaukee who invent a driveway game called baseketball and it becomes so popular that it becomes a professional sport. But when the founder of baseketball dies, the two guys end up owning the league and an evil corporate guy tries to take over the team.
Jenny McCarthy and Yasmine Bleeth appear as the babes of the film and there's some cameo appearances by sports greats such as Dale Earnhardt and Reggie Jackson.Check this movie out. You'll laugh your @$$ off!",Null,0,2,29 June 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The greatest action movie ever made!
","This was truly the greatest action movie ever made. This movie is to action what Star Wars is to sci-fi. This is the best work from the Cameron/ Schwarzenegger team.The story goes like this. Over a decade since the destruction of the first Terminator and the birth of John Connor(the future leader of the human resistance), Sarah Connor is put in a mental asylum for attempting to destroy Cyberdyne Systems, the corporation who will create Skynet, the super computer who is responsible for a nuclear war. Shortly afterward two terminators are sent from the future. One reprogrammed to protect young John Connor from the second, the deadly liquid metal T-1000. In the process they must destroy Cyberdyne and prevent the future war.Arnold does a great job as the title character and sometimes does seem more man than machine('I need a vacation.') Linda Hamilton also did an outstanding job in her recurring role as Sarah. Eddie Furlong does a great job for his film debut and Robert Patrick as about as cold and evil as Arnold was in the first movie.Hasta La Vista, Baby! 10/10",10,1,1,22 June 2000
Face_Off," AWESOME!!!
","Face/Off is an action-packed movie with great acting and a very intriguing plot.Six years after the murder of his son by brutal madman, Castor Troy(Cage), FBI Agent Sean Archer(Travolta) has hunted down Troy and put him in a coma. But before he did, Troy and his gang masterminded a plot to destroy a good portion of Los Angeles using a hidden bomb. Unable to get Troy's gang to speak, Archer undergoes a secret mission using Castor Troy's face and voice and goes to prison to try and get Troy's brother to tell him where the bomb is hidden. But then Castor Troy comes out of his coma and all hell breaks loose as he takes Archer's identity.
The best part of the movie is the story(but believe me, don't try to explain it to your friends before they see it, because it won't make any sense)which leads to an explosive finale between Travolta and Cage. They are brilliant in their roles.I give this movie a 10/10",10,3,4,10 July 2000
Die Hard 2," 'Another basement, another elevator! How can the same s*** happen to the same guy twice?'
","I don't know how it could but it did and I enjoyed it a lot. This was one great flick and it's one of those movies that seem longer than it actually is.John McClane(Willis)is back. Only this time he's at Dulles Airport in Washington D.C. waiting for his wife's plane to arrive. But when McClane stumbles upon a couple of terrorists he tries to warn everyone in the control tower about it. But before they could do anything, the terrorists shut down all of the plane's landing systems. The terrorist leader led by Col. Stuart(played greatly by William Sadler)is demanding that major foreign drug dealer, General Esperanza is freed. But since the tower is powerless, McClane wages another one man war against the terrorists and must hurry before his wife's plane crashes.Willis and Sadler do great jobs in their roles. Dennis Franz also does a funny job as the airport police chief. It has a great return of some old characters such as Bonnie Bedelia, William Atherton, and Reginald VelJohnson.This gets my vote as the most entertaining of the three Die Hard movies. 10/10",Null,2,3,18 July 2000
Ghostbusters," Good effects + funny dialogue= Great movie.
","Ghostbusters is a fun movie with great special effects. This used to be my favorite movie as a kid and I just recently saw the DVD version and I could see why I liked it so much.It's the story of three New York paranormal investigators who were just fired from their university and consider this an omen that they should go into business for themselves. The three(and later four) of them find themselves to be most successful and popular paranormal eliminators. But once one of them gets involved with a woman who lives in a demonic spirit like building things turn ugly for them, with sometimes hilarious results.Anyone who doesn't like this movie either hasn't seen it or doesn't have a sense of humor. I don't know who wouldn't laugh at Bill Murray's hilarious one-liners or the classic Stay Puft Marshmallow Man scene.A great movie. 9/10",Null,0,0,6 August 2000
Detroit Rock City," Detroit Rock City rocks!
","My summary says it all. This movie did rock! It had funny characters, a funny story and an awesome soundtrack, especially Van Halen's Runnin' with the Devil.The story is set in Cleveland, 1978. Four boys, Hawk, Jam, Lex and Trip who are part of a rock band named Mystery which is modeled after their favorite band, KISS. They bought tickets to see them and go on a road trip to Detroit and get into many misadventures dealing with an angry mother, some tough jocks, some disco freaks, a stolen car and an attempt to win money.This movie was Eddie Furlong's second best(T2 was the first) and it was a takeoff for the other guys. The only thing I would've changed was the mood, it seemed just a little dark for my taste but it was still an awesome movie. 9/10",9,23,28,19 July 2000
Die Hard," Yippee-ki-yay!
","This has to be one of the greatest action films of the 80's. It goes up with the best alongside The Terminator, RoboCop, and Lethal Weapon. This movie should be considered an action classic.It's the story of New York Cop John McClane who has come out to L.A. to visit his family for Christmas. He goes to his wife's new job which is located in an L.A. highrise for a party. Except who knew that a group of German terrorists would come along and crash the party.Bruce Willis is cast perfectly as the cop who's in the wrong place at the wrong time. Alan Rickman was superb as Hans Gruber and Bonnie Bedelia did a good job as McClane's wife. There are also some good supporting characters such as Reginald VelJohnson, Alexander Gudonov, Paul Gleason, and William Atherton.Besides having some of the best action sequences ever filmed it also has the best one-liners ever quoted in a movie('Happy trails, Hans!').
For a slick and action-packed movie, Die Hard is the one to see!Yippee-Ki-Yay, motherf@#%er!",Null,0,0,31 May 2000
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Third time's a charm.
","Die Hard with a Vengeance was a great movie and in my opinion was the best of the Die Hard trilogy. Even though the first two were a little more entertaining, this one is the smartest of the three.Bruce Willis is again Lt. John McClane. A few years after he saved Nakatomi Plaza and Dulles Airport, he is back in New York after his marriage crumbled and is suspended from the force. And to make things worse he is about to have one very bad day as a mad bomber named Simon(played brilliantly by Irons)is out for personal revenge on McClane and in the process earn a very large amount of money. This time McClane has back up, an angry fast-talking guy named Zeus(played by Jackson)whose alongside McClane in the wrong place at the wrong time.The key strength in this movie has to be the acting, especially the verbal racial bouts between Willis and Jackson. These are two great actors. Irons brilliantly plays the vengeful villain.Simon says to watch this movie! 10/10",10,0,0,9 July 2000
Kingpin," Another dumb comedy. All right!!!
","I loved Kingpin, simply because it was a dumb comedy. I like dumb comedies like Half-Baked or Bio-Dome, because they're just plain fun to watch.Roy Munson is a former champion bowler who has become an alcoholic after losing his hand. One day he meets an Amish bowler named Ishmael and offers to teach him to bowl and they head for Reno for the National Bowling Championship.Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid and Bill Murray are as always hilarious.

Scream," Started another horror trend.
","This movie started the third major horror movie trend. Psycho started the first, after a while people started to lose interest in the genre. It was brought back to life with Halloween which started another trend that was mainly made up of masked murders and gallons of gory makeup. Again that died down after a decade or so and then another trend was started by the movie Scream.In the small town of Woodsboro, California, two gruesome murders were committed. A small group of teenagers all become suspects until their deaths. Sidney Prescott is the main target of this killer whose mother was butchered one year earlier.I found this to be a really good movie. I think of it as a spoof of horror films. Then came Scary Movie which (Dennis Miller says) basically parodied the parody of horror films. This movie also suffered the same effects that Halloween did. Halloween spawned the Friday the 13th movies and a bunch of other clones. This movie spawned I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legends, Disturbing Behavior and The Faculty and I thought they all sucked. Even Scream's sequels I didn't think were that great. So basically I thought Scream was good but anything(except H20)that came after went downhill.This movie also contained a good cast. The extremely beautiful Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox give great performances. David Arquette, Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy provided the movies great sense of humor, which was one of it's stronger points. Skeet Ulrich gave kind of a creepy feeling to the movie I thought. Also the plot twists at the end were nice.Another thing that made this movie great was it's good direction. One scene inparticular that I thought worked really well was the scene where Dewey was searching the house toward the end and heard screaming and it was none other than Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween on TV. I've never been a big Wes Craven fan but I give him credit for this movie's good direction.If you don't hate horror movies, check this out. 8/10",Null,0,0,7 October 2000
Halloween," A true horror masterpiece
","I first saw this movie three years ago. It was back when I couldn't stand horror movies. I saw a few of the Friday the 13th movies and after that I thought all horror movies blew. I then saw bits and pieces of Halloween 2 and thought 'this wasn't bad.' Later one night I saw the first Halloween on Fox. It wasn't anything like the Friday movies. It was awesome. I was fortunate enough to see the added TV scenes, but unfortunately it was edited for TV. I rented the movie and had never been so jittery after a movie. I saw all the sequels and thought they were all good in their own ways but none were as good as the original. If you want a good shock, don't waste your money on those stupid Friday the 13th movies.

Trainspotting," Choose life, choose a future, choose this movie.
","Trainspotting is a very cool movie. I like movies that can be both funny and dramatic at the same time. Danny Boyle did a great job on this movie just as he did with Shallow Grave and A Life Less Ordinary.Mark Renton is trying to kick his drug habit and fix his life. But his flatmates Sick Boy, Spud and Begbie aren't making it any easier for him.
This had to be Ewan McGregor's best performance of his career so far. Can't wait to see his work in the next Star Wars. But I also found a major performance standout in Robert Carlyle as Begbie. He was one creepy guy. Forget slasher villians, nothings scarier than a psychopath with a short fuse.

The Matrix," One of the five worst of 1999.
","This is the only review I've written so far that was based on a movie that I didn't finish watching. I found the first half to be pretty dull so I turned it off. In it's defense it had good visual effects but nothing much more. Keanu Reeves is still not a good actor. In fact I only liked him in Speed and Bill and Ted. I didn't feel it deserved those Oscars though, because I thought The Phantom Menace had better effects, not to mention being a much, much better movie. I think this was just a weak attempt to beat Star Wars at the box office. And why are they making two sequels? To make a good sequel you have to have a good movie to base it on. Next to South Park, Austin Powers 2, Blair Witch and Wild, Wild West this was the worst movie of last year. If you want to see some of last year's best, see The Phantom Menace, American Pie, Detroit Rock City or Bowfinger. But avoid the Matrix unless you just want a good visual effects movie. 1/10",Null,0,0,23 September 2000

I loved the simple story, the likeable characters, and the outstanding special effects. When the Special Editions were released I saw it a number of times. No movie will ever capture my imagination like this one did.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," My favorite film of all time.
","I know what you're thinking. 'There are millions of movies out there, what makes this your all time favorite?' Well the truth is this. I've seen hundreds of movies in my life. When it comes to me and film, there's no genre I don't like and a movie has to have a lot of annoying qualities for me to dislike it. So I'm quite easy to please when it comes to the cinema. I know I haven't answered your question yet but bear with me.There was a time before I saw Star Wars and at that point I never really saw a movie that I didn't like. But once I first witnessed the adventures in that galaxy far, far away, my imagination (for the very first time) was actually pulled from reality and into this 'space opera'. I've never really been one for fantasy. In fact to this day, I can't quite understand the hoopla surrounding Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings. But for some reason I can't really explain, these movies did it for me.You see, the (original) Star Wars trilogy for me is what really made me look at movies as more than just something to keep you entertained on a rainy day. At this point on, it was the basis of comparison to all the films I've seen in my life. I have yet to see a movie that I like better and I doubt I ever will because when it comes to MY taste in movies, this trilogy is as perfect as it gets.Now that I've totally gotten over my little Star Wars love fest there, let me go on to explain why The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite.I didn't see Star Wars until I was 15 so I wasn't one of those kids who grew up with it. Although if I knew then what I knew now, I'm sure it would be different. Anyway, I started seeing all this commotion about it's Special Edition re-release in 1997. It was obvious that there was something special about these movies that stood the test of time. So I went into the basement and found my dad's old Beta copies of the trilogy and decided to check them out. (I'm glad I kept my old Beta VCR, heheh) I popped in the original film and suddenly a whole new world of film was opened up to me. (But that's a whole other story.) I was so captivated by the magic of the original film, that I was kind of afraid to watch the sequels as I was afraid they would be inferior. How do you live up to that kind of masterpiece? I've never second guessed a movie since that day.So the time came to watch The Empire Strikes Back. I wanted to see the continuing adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia and see if they could really bring down the evil Darth Vader. They blew up the Death Star already I thought they won! Until this point, I thought Star Wars was just this happy tale of good triumphing over evil. Well...I was blown away to see Luke attacked by the Wampa Ice Creature when the movie started, the AT-AT Walkers demolishing the rebel base on Hoth, Han Solo frozen in carbonite before the eyes of those who loved him and Darth Vader revealing Luke Skywalker's true parentage. (Of course, I already knew that, but everyone knew even if they didn't see the movies.) At the end, the bad guys won. You don't really see that in a lot of movies, because it wouldn't work. Unless you're creating a trilogy, that just doesn't sit well with audiences. If I saw RoboCop and at the end he was blown to pieces, I would be disappointed. But here it works, because you knew there was another movie coming and there was time to make everything all right.This movie has everything a film buff could love. It has action, humor, romance and characters that I haven't been so in love with until I saw Trainspotting. However, that's a completely different type of film.By the time it was all over, I realized that this film had more of an impact on me emotionally than the original film did. At the end of the first film I found myself cheering for the characters. At the end of this one I found myself worrying about them and hoping that it would all be all right.The Star Wars saga is, and will always be my favorite saga of all time. Because even if I'm having a bad day at work or one of my friends gets mad at me for saying something stupid or a girl decides she's finally had enough of me, the Star Wars saga will always be there to bring back my sanity. Heheh.And that's why this is my favorite movie of all time. 10/10",10,0,0,28 October 1999
The Breakfast Club," An 80's classic.
","While the 80's had a truckload of great movies, this was one of the best. It was the most true to life of all of them even though the scenario seems a little unlikely to really happen.The story is simple. Five kids from different lives are all brought together in Saturday detention. We have Andrew the jock, Brian who is the nerdy one, Claire the prom queen, Bender the troublemaker, and Allison the outcast. They all started out basically disliking each other but as the day grew on they learned trust in each other and turned detention into a fun day.What I liked best about this movie was the acting. These are all of these actors at their best. What I meant about the unlikely scenario was that I doubt that one of each of these kind of people would be in detention at the same time, but I guess that was part of the uniqueness of the story. Once you see it you'll overlook it.Highly recommended. 10/10",Null,0,1,26 July 2000
Back to the Future," One of the best movies to come out of the 80's.
",I have to say that a million great movies came out of the 80's. But Back to the Future has to be within the top ten and at least in the top 20 of the most fun movies.Doc Brown has invented a time machine(out of a DeLorean)and Marty McFly has accidentally been transported to 1955. He also screws up his parents first meeting. So he has to figure out a way to get his parents back together and get back to the future.This movie has a load of memorable scenes such as the skateboard chase through Hill Valley and an awesome scene is when Marty plays Johnny B. Goode on stage at his parent's dance. I also liked the scene when Marty's dad knocks out his nemesis Biff. The scene with the lightning bolt and the clock tower was suspenseful when I first saw it.A very cool movie. 10/10,Null,0,1,13 January 2001
