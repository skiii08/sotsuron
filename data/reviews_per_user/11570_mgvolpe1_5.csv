3:10 to Yuma," Too bad the director didn't watch the first movie or read the story line.
","I've watched the original several times. That whole movie made a whole lot of sense and even the ending made sense, plus they made you aware of why Wade did what he did. This miserable adaptation made absolutely no sense whatsoever! You've read the ending in other reviews so I won't belabor the point. But, I was stunned at what I watched and came out of the theater feeling duped and cheated. No rhyme reason or song as to why Wade would 'off' his own men who had just gone to extreme measures to rescue him. Did the director think I was stupid? Did the writers think we were all so dense we wouldn't question the motive? Did Russell Crowe ever ask the director, 'What's my motivation for murdering my entire loyal crew'? And after that fiasco, we don't get closure as to whether Wade's son gets the money and saves the family ranch from the evil land grabbers. I was so depressed when exiting the theater I wished I could get my money back and the 1 hour and 57 minutes of wasted time.",1,18,32,15 October 2007
Monster," Dark, Disgusting and that's the way it should be, But!
","This movie had nothing to do with entertainment! So I guess you would call it Doc-U-Drama. Ms Theron did a fantastic job of portraying this pitiful creature. I guess we're supposed to understand how she became this avenging murderer of men. because of the mistreatment she was subjected to when growing up. But wait a minute, didn't Oprah Winfry have a tragic upbringing?? Hhmmmm? The biggest gripe and criticism I have about the movie is I wasn't able to hear the dialogue through much of the movie. Somewhere along the movie making process the directors or editors have decided to make the sound track louder than the dialogue. For us older senior citizens that reduces us to watching subtitles to understand what the he__ is going on. But to my dismay the DVD I rented only came with Spanish subtitles. Now that is a stroke of genius. I can't hear what the cast is saying, I don't read Spanish, so I got very little from watching this movie.",5,0,1,27 January 2006
Collateral," Flowing smooth direction throughout the entire movie.
","This movie is easy to watch and get involved in. Cruise isengaging and you almost get to like him if it wasn't for his chosenprofession. Jamie Foxx gives the most believable performance ofhis career. Usually I can't stand his flippant meager attempts atslapstick humor. But he excels in this effort. The camera anglesand scene works with reflections from the glass and out of focusframes was very entertaining. A lot of planning and originality wentinto this very enjoyable, dark, movie. Although the ending was notto my liking. I am a romantic and like happy endings. A brief scenewith Foxx and Jada riding off in their limousine would have beenthe way I would have ended it. Oh well Mr. Mann didn't ask for myopinion. So I take no responsibility for his ending.",8,0,0,16 August 2004
The Transporter," Action Packed
","I  started watching this movie with a wary eye, But much to mysurprise it was a treat to watch. The opening had someunbelievable fare that made you wonder if this was a comedy orwhat? Well you get to like Statham and admire his expertise at his'craft'. The movie moves along at a good pace, some stretching ofthe possibilities with driving and parachuting. But all in all I liked it.Worth the watch.",8,0,1,16 January 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," Absolutely better than the 'Bourne Identity'.
",Matt Damon has found his nitch. I think this could become a series every bit as good as the 'Bond'  genre. The movie starts out fast moving and never slowsdown. The cast was very good and all the acting is top notch. The story wascoherent and the total package just a joy to experience. Plus I don't think I remember hearing the 'F' word once during the movie. I could watch this onewith my grandchildren and never feel uncomfortable. I will definitely get this one for my DVD movie collection.,10,3,4,1 August 2004
