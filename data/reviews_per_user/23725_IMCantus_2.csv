Million Dollar Arm," So cheesy
",Should've known. Disney title. But hoped for better. Respected names. Potentially unusually awesome story. But oh my god why so cheesy? Why?! 13 in a dozen. Pretty lame. No point in watching. You know everything that's gonna happen. The only twist is in the story comes courtesy of a stomach ache after Indian food. My ass speaks Hindi!Should've known. Disney title. But hoped for better.

Love & Mercy," Beached like a whale - No fan? No good.
","This was so bad. 25 minutes of my life I'll never get back. I could have been having a lap dance from a incontinent baby rhino. But no. Although, watching Paul Dano's wide range of a singular emotion (pathetic) at full display must feel similar. There's this critic review. Slant Magazine. 38. He's right. Don't watch it unless you're a fan and you don't care about this flat, emotionally manipulative, headachingly predictable story. Fans don't care. They'll love it anyway. That's why they're fans and that's cool. I have the same. Different criteria for quality then.",5,0,0,17 May 2020
