Black Swan," Black swan is an intense psycho sexual thriller!
","Black swan is an intense psycho sexual thriller! One of the most beautiful movies ever made. Yes its about ballet but you don't have to like ballet to think this movie is awesome. The main plot is about a girl who is competing to become the best dancer so she can be swan queen in the upcoming production; that alone sounds extremely boring. What makes this movie intense and capturing is the subplot! It will Blow your mind! The viewer is never told much about the main character or her mental state but i feel that is one of the beauties of this movie. Director Darren Aronofsky always finds a way of implying the story with what happens in the film itself instead of explaining it in the film with words. This is great and shows extreme skill in the art of directing.The music... classical, vibrant, linked to the visuals perfectly in every instance. Without it the emotion and glory of the insanity that the orchestra was unfolding, the movie would be lost. Composer Clint Mansell outdid himself because without his mastery black swan would not be the brilliant success that it has become.The movies theme was about perfection and becoming imperfect to achieve this perfection. Complex yes, but totally understood at the end. There is extreme sexual tension between all the characters! This grabs the audience instantly because everyone anywhere can relate to it.Light, Darkness, Good and Evil combine and become important to the films outlook. Every time a character was doing something impure everything became more attractive but more evil, filling the screen with different ranges of dark composition. Truly beautiful! If you think Ballet is boring now you won't after seeing this. Watch this movie! It will make you think! If you like art this movie is full of it; between all the movements of the dance physically between the lights and darks of the other characters. This movie is a masterpiece!",Null,0,2,20 January 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Brutal masterpiece!
",Tarantino really out did if self with Inglourious Basterds. It is everything you would expect from a Tarantino film. Its an awesome brutal masterpiece! The characters so well defined and thought out. There personality's so vivid its as if I've known them. Although the story strays away from the actually historical events it works. works better than anyone would have thought. If you know Tarantino films u know none are without an amazing sound track. The music goes with the movie very well just as kill bill's music did. Its not all Brutality though it has its fare share of hilarious parts and Depressing parts. I feel this movie is Very well rounded. Every aspect is done to perfection. Its a must see.The best thing about it... the audience doesn't feel bad or disgusted with the brutality as they would be in other brutal movies. That's because Its Nazis hahaha.,Null,0,4,11 January 2010
Shutter Island," =) reed my review, it tells the truth.
","I wasn't expecting much from this film after seeing the trailers but after actually seeing it.... I must say I'm surprised. I did not reed the novel so my opinion is that of the movie purely.The story was so excellent that after seeing it , it left me thinking; discovering new things even after the film was over. I had a 30 min debate because my friend saw the end in a different way than me. Any movie that can mean different things to different people is worth looking into. Poems do that, not movies.Unfortunately there was a couple parts that didn't make sense but they in no way took away from the overall meaning or awe of the film.I advise you to see it. I would say its one of the best of the year.",Null,0,3,15 March 2010
Avatar," Avatar has its ups and downs
","Avatar is an excellent film. From its awesome original premise and well developed characters to its environment and lighting, Avatar is a well thought out movie. Also, Its rising action to falling action ratio was well formulated unlike most movies. The new 3D Technology really ads a punch in the face. Its like every possible depth is 3 dimensional. All the shots with depth of field turned out even more awesome. This movie has its share of small problems though. There's a tribal ritual were they wave there arms back and forth was by my opinion a really stupid idea.They just look funny for such a serious seen. The idea of the hair worms that help them talk to there ancestors and connect with other animals was an awesome idea but not explained whatsoever. Did evolution just decide give them an unneeded body part so that they can control animals and talk to there ancestors. I'm not saying it wasn't cool it just needed to be explained. One more thing. what were those white floaty things? sprites? the ancestors spirits? If so why did they talk to the trees when they should have been talking to them and why did they reincarnate into these things? Or were they bugs that were worshiped? Either way it's weird and unneeded. Those are just small problems. The movie was really awesome, i gave it a 9. Seriously one of the best movies of the year.",Null,2,6,5 January 2010
