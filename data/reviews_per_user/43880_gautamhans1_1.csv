The Expendables 2," Utterly boring ! Mindless action !
","What I thought after reading the reviews was -- 'OMG ! I got to watch this positive-feedback-given movie A.S.A.P.' But all my excitement was wistful. This movie was a total crap. Let me ask you a question. Do you like a movie which moves very fast and is predictable at any point and where even the jokes are bad? I assure of a big NO ! I mean, with this huge cast of Stallone, Statham, Li, Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude, the director showed us that even such great stars can be used to produce such fail movie. This sequel to 'The Expendables' is crap and all the good reviews about this movie also.Bottom line: Don't watch.",2,3,6,21 April 2013
