Requiem for a Dream," brutal, brilliant
","DO NOT make this a 'date movie'. Instead, watch it with a close friend, 'cause when it's over you'll want to talk deeply about it with someone. This film is by no means entertaining, it's more like torture. But it is what it is - a brutal journey that reminds us of what drugs can do. I really cared for the characters, I didn't think they were just some junkies biting the dust. The director, screenwriter and actors make us symphasise with them. All four leads are amazing, and their slow journey into hell is so realistic. The music and imagery is very bleak, and even though a happy ending looks doubtful from the get-go, the climax of the film is still really shocking. They should show this film in every high school, instead of those lame 'say nope to dope' B-grade education shows.",Null,0,0,20 February 2003
The Ring," excellent!!
","This film is so creepy and well-crafted. I was really surprised at how scary this movie actually was. The scene at the end had me and my friends (I might note, one of them franticly left during this scene, saying they had to 'go to the toilet'. Yeah, right) jumping out of our seats. It was that spooky and the jump tactic worked really well on me, my friends and the whole audience. Naomi Watts does really well, expressing all sorts of emotions such as dread, strength, vulnerability and so on. The music was really eerie, contrasting perfectly with the film's bleak, often surreal imagery. Overall, 'The Ring' is the most effective horror film for quite some time, and that little girl is truly the most freakiest devil-disguised-as-a-child since Regan in 'The Exorcist' Two thumbs up!!",Null,1,1,20 February 2003
Moulin Rouge!," stooopid
","In my opinion, I thought this movie was cruddy. I know many people really like this film, but I just thought it was one of the most over-rated movies I have ever seen. Overall it is just style over substance, and it was really hard for me to sit through two hours of watching people plastered with make-up run around and act like total idiots. I know many of you loved it, but it was just not for me at all.",Null,2,4,4 March 2003
Scream," the best horror film
","This film rocks,mainly because of its original storyline, great cast, and genuine scares. The opening scene is the best part of the whole film, and Drew Barrymore does such a great job as the tortured victim. Neve Campbell is also really good, proving she's one of the most talented actresses in Hollywood. Kevin Williamson wrote such a cool and edgy script, and he really knows how to mix horror with comedy elements. I remember when this first came out, and everyone was like, 'have you seen Scream yet?' It was that popular, and it still is today. It has become a major pop culture icon for the teen films of today. I only wish they make a fourth.",Null,0,0,10 November 2002
Final Destination," freaky movie!
","This movie really freaked me out when I first saw it. The whole premise of death coming to get you when your ticket was up was really dark and imaginative. The shock tactics used in the film actually work, and many of them will result in the viewer watching through the cracks of their fingers or jumping right out of their seat. The acting is pretty good for a teen horror movie, I think Ali Larter stood out as the smart loner Clear Rivers. Anyway this movie rises above the normal standard of teen slashers because of its dark and ghastly tone, extremely effective shock tactics and a freaky plot that makes you shudder and think at the same time. Can't wait for the sequal!",Null,0,1,27 February 2003
