50 First Dates," Just saw it
","Just saw it..and I have to say that I was really surprised at how much i like it.  I do really like adam sandler a lot, but after watching the trailer to this movie, I thought it looked a lot like the same old comedy.  But it was different just enough and was highly enjoyable.  Drew Barrymore didn't even annoy me as much as she usually does. It was good enough to even be considered one of sandler's best.",8,0,0,13 February 2004
As Good as It Gets," Nicholson at his best
","I have to say that I'm not a big fan of Jack Nicholson, I just don't see what's so great about him. But As Good As It Gets is truly a great movie. I was surprised at how much I liked it actually. Helen Hunt does a fantastic job and in my mind there was no doubt that she deserved the Oscar. I think the best performance comes from Cuba Gooding Jr. in this movie. He is an actor that really knows how to pick his parts. This movie actually makes me like Jack Nicholson! I give it a 10/10",10,1,1,25 October 2002
American Pie," Definitely a must-see
","This movie is definitely something that people should see. The humor is a particular taste, but it brings to light something good about sex. Admittedly some of the things done in this movie are out-there, but they are just so funny to see. I think the Adam Herz has definitely experienced some of this. Whoever casted this film did a great job. Jason Biggs and Seann-William Scott are absolutely hilarious. I think Mena Suvari stands out as doing the best job. Eugene Levy is hilarious as well. The only thing I didn't like was Eddie Kaye Thomas, not that he did a bad job I just thought he could have done better. I think that everyone should see this, to know what teenage sexuality is like.",7,2,5,23 October 2002
Armageddon," The most underrated film in history
","Now I know a lot of people don't like this film, but their are people out there that do, and I happen to be one of them. I normally don't like movies that have poor editing and are as far-fetched as this. You have to look at this movie as just an entertaining and fun time. It has a great cast that seemed to just be having fun making it. It was enjoyable to watch and I ignored all of the mistakes(and I realize there were a lot). It did not bother me at all and I absolutely love this film. I give it a 10, because it is so enjoyable and fun to watch. If you can't laugh at this movie, chances are you didn't have many friends in high school(Roger Ebert). Don't listen to what everyone says when they tell you this movie sucks. Give it a chance and see it for yourself.",8,2,3,23 October 2002
American Beauty," I don't think so!
","Everyone seems to love this movie! I thought it was OK, but it wasn't anything special or even close to it. Don't get me wrong, I didn't think the movie sucked, but I don't understand why people liked it so much. Everything in it has been done a thousand times, the acting wasn't that great just average. How did this win Best Picture? The movie was actually boring at times, and just plain dumb at others. It seemed like the writers just wanted to put one shocking scene after another, but failed repeatedly. Mena Suvari and Thora Birch are two of the few strong points in this movie. Both have great performances, but other than that it was just dumb, partly because of how much people liked it. I give it a 4/10",8,0,1,29 October 2002
Aliens," Good I Guess!
","I enjoyed watching this movie, although I don't think it's as good as some people seem to think it is. The special effects are good, and the editing is also pretty good, but other than that there isn't a lot that I care about in this movie. I give it a 3 1/2 out of 5!",8,1,2,2 November 2002
Any Given Sunday," Did not like this!
","I thought that this was a rather dumb movie! It wasn't about football at all. It had football, but wasn't about it. Al Pacino is at his worst in this movie. Cameron Diaz doesn't do her best job. James Woods is the only one who seems to know what he is doing. I don't ever want to watch this movie again. Oh yeah and this movie way was long!",5,1,1,2 November 2002
