Kill Bill: Vol. 2," too slow too bad
","Kill Bill 2 is a long agonizing view of a director's self loving extravaganza. There are a few really cool moments most of them are in the second trailer. The plot again was off balance but there was no fun, no wittiness and no real action. It's all a big build up to a stupid 'Lord of the rings' long ending without the caring or the plot to keep the viewer interested. Uma Thurman is pretty but no one can just stare at her for 135 minutes without getting bored. The rest of the cast played with a  cartoon charecter's depth is annoying at best. Budd is a clasical shouthern idiot which doesn't explain how he is a brother to Bill and the rest of the cast including the charecter of the martial arts teacher are shallow and do little to entertain while spiting their lines with overacting seen usually in college productions. I will see the next Tarantino movie but I will wait for it to reach the little screen.",3,3,6,5 May 2004
Black Hawk Down," A tipical ridley Scot movie
","After seeing several of this director films, I was shocked that the audience accepted a unit of elite soldiers who act in a stupid unprofessional way with one antagonism outsider to lead them to the light. This is a bad depiction of war and what makes or breaks us as a fighting unit. If you want to see a good war movie, watch 'When trumpets fade.'",Null,0,1,25 January 2002
