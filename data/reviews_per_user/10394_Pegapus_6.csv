The Blair Witch Project," If you only see one movie this year, DON'T make it this one!
","The more I think about this movie, the more ripped off I feel.  I saw the movie when it was first released.  When the ending finally came, I laughed my head off, I was so shocked that there wasn't more to it.I was queasy throughout from the horrible camera work (even if it was planned that way, it was disgusting!) and almost left from disgust several times through the movie.  Don't bother seeing this film!  If ten of you pay 20¢ toward a $2.00 rental and plan to get drunk while watching it, you're STILL overpaying for it!See 'The Sixth Sense' instead, or 'Stir of Echoes.'  Both of them are worth a thousand Blair Witch Projects.",1,2,5,1 March 2000
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Overly melodramatic at times, a roller coaster ride with highs, and lows, but very little middle ground.
","I confess. I read the book about a dozen times in the past few years. It's not like I don't do anything else, but I do. In a year, I probably get through about 25-30 books. So reading HP and the DH was just something I was enjoying. There are clues in various places in the books, and you just have to marvel at how Jo Rowling tied up all the ends so nicely in the last one.The one thing, though, that I felt was off in 7 was how she portrayed Hagrid. In a few cases, it seemed like she was treating him like a buffoon, but that's a personal opinion, not something that critically could be considered wrong with the book.But the last book kept elements close together. It brought in all the old characters, added a few new ones, but basically held together things with bonds of steel. The relationships were both old and new, with a true feeling of family and friendships. And we all celebrated the good times in the book and lamented the bad times.So when Mad-Eye Moody gets killed so early in the book, a feeling of loss goes with him. When Fleur is so happy to be marrying Bill, we're all happy for them both. When we see Kreacher turn from a foul house-elf to a fine house-servant, we're happy for him. When Tonks tells us she is pregnant, we celebrate! But almost none of that is in the movie. We know instinctively that those things happened in the book, but if you haven't read them, you're going to go WTF? an awful lot.Mad-Eye is killed in the chase, but there isn't a toast to this memory. When Fleur is so intense about the wedding, we see no real emotion, but for one brief moment. When the trio leaves Kreacher for their exploits at the ministry, we have no idea how much he has changed. And when Tonks and Lupin go off, there is nothing to suggest the very sad and aching love they have for each other, and about Remus's hesitation about his upcoming fatherhood.There is no investment in these characters in the film. It's like 'strip the souls from everyone but Ron, Harry and Hermione, make the others more melodramatic with no attachment to the real story, and voilà! you have Deathly Hallows Part One.' I confess: I don't like David Yates' direction. There has been something off about it since OOTP, though I might be one of the few who think that. I think his often amateurish direction is quite obvious in this film. The film is often like a roller coaster, with giddy high points, either in the action or the tone, but there are also many very low points, and there is nothing in the middle. We don't LEARN anything from the characters--we follow them on their journey, yes, but we have to inject too much of the overall plot from the book to see what has been left out, and what is still present. There are times when a collage filming of the many places the trio (and in the middle, the duo) went could get that section speeded up without weighing it down (a friend with me found the middle WAY too slow), and at times, a more polished director could have found ways to make the scenes pack a lot more information into them. It certainly didn't look like the kids weren't eating a whole lot, or how much Hermione actually fit into her small pocketbook. The scene that could have managed that would have been the scene in the book where Hermione packs the full sized painting of Sirius Black's relative, Phinea Black, former headmaster of Hogwarts, into her bag. But it was not to be.I think if there had been a consistent tone during the film, it would have helped bring a more cohesive tone to the film, interlocking all the elements into one. But there wasn't that kind of a feeling in it, and I am disappointed that it didn't happen.I might be one of the very few fans who feels the film wasn't a very good one. Yes, it's only half of a whole, and the second half might be a totally different one, emotionally, and dramatically. But I just need to say to fans, go with the warning that there are a lot of faults with this installment, and accept it just as a nice visual film, with very, very little to do with the entire HP legacy. It probably won't help, and you will be filling in the blanks from the books, but it's certainly better than nothing.",7,41,56,19 November 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Quite excellent with a great visual sense
","Alfonso Cuaron has done well in his first effort at Harry Potter. The third book is relatively well covered in terms of content of the film, and while it looks occasionally that it goes off topic, those points are finally meshed in a series of climactic scenes that tie up the final ending well.There are a couple of points I want to make about the film, and different areas that interested me as to how they would be handled.1. Richard Harris's death and the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. As Richard Harris's death was well publicized, and his replacement was picked early and people got a chance to see Gambon's Dumbledore through trailers, specials and news info, fans of HP could get used to him, and knew (or at the very least hoped) that he had the physical presence to handle the character. While I missed the wee bit of Irish brogue we knew from Harris, I felt very comfortable with Gambon's performance. His Dumbledore has a bit of an impish quality, I feel, and merry twinkles filled his eyes. I found myself smiling, as both his spirit and his qualities of leadership and intellect were intact.2. The kids. There have been rumors that the kids are getting too old to play the parts of the kids in the novel. Well, I hate to say this, but the kids 'in the novel' ARE the kids in RL. The two are joined at the hip, and the characters in the novels ARE growing up. They're not cute little 11 year olds anymore--they are now 13-14, and they are entering their teenage years. As are the actors who are playing them. I heard JK Rowling herself say that Daniel, Emma and Rupert are the embodiments of Harry, Hermione and Ron, and I can see that way too. I think it would take away from the aging and the maturing of both the actors and the characters if they thought about replacing them with younger actors. We're seeing an incredible effort here in trying to maintain a sense of continuity. I don't think they should meddle with that.3. The director. Alfonso Cuaron hasn't done that many films, but I am a huge fan of his 'A Little Princess' from 1995. If you haven't seen that film, you've missed a true and beautiful gem. 'Princess' is a remake of France Hodgson Burnett's book, and an earlier Shirley Temple film. It is a wondrous and excellent film, and it makes me appreciate the man's wonderful ability to work with many children, and utilize the adults to work with the children with complete fluidity. In HP3, he brings out a wonderful mixture of emotions in all the characters and the actors who play them. He knows how to handle animals (including completely CGI ones!) as well, and makes us believe that the animals are more than just 'actors' like the rest of the cast. Chris Columbus has grown up quite a bit since his early days as a director (think Gremlins), but Cuaron has a natural talent which is overwhelmingly rich and strong. I haven't seen other of his films, but I can't wait now to at least try to see them.4. The cinematography. In the first two movies, much of the film concentrated on the interior of the castle at Hogwarts, on the deepest darkest secrets of it, and in general were tools to help make Hogwarts into something with which its characters and the audience could be well familiar. The first movie, of course, concentrated on Harry's and the others' first glimpse and view of the School of Magic, and the second film concentrated on the legacy of Slytherin and Voldemort. In Prison of Azkaban, we are given an unfamiliar landscape, literally. Viewed in broad daylight, the Whomping Willow doesn't seem as scary as it did at night, but the forest beyond still holds a sense of mystery and wonder, both dark and benign at the same time. The cinematography shows expanses of beauty that stretch far beyond what the eye can see. The Scottish Highlands are so beautiful, and they are used to the best advantage in this film. When Harry takes the first ride on Buck Beak (a hippogriff, who is part horse and part eagle), the sense of freedom at flight is captured with great effect. And another flying scene, in the miserably handled Quidditch game also shows great emotion: Harry's run-in with the dementors is well handled with a visual sense of claustrophobia and despair. 5. The casting. I must admit the one film I knew David Thewlis from (Dragonheart) made me think he was a bit sniveling and nasty as the character he played in that other film. A fresh look at him through Remus Lupin made me very happy to see his excellent range and grasp of the particular character he plays in HP3. Lupin, the new Professor of the Dark Arts, is an old friend of Harry's dad. He is also a friend to Sirius Black, and another character who features in this installment. He is able to show a keen sense of empathy to Harry, as well as help Harry in learning defenses against the Dementors, and becomes a true friend to Harry. Emma Thompson comes on board as Professor Trelawney. If you have read the books, you know Trelawney will feature quite prominently in #5, The Order of the Phoenix. The introduction to the character shows her as rather eccentric, with a flair for the dramatic and whatever will garner her the strongest reactions. Keep watching her--she will be a force to reckon with at a point down the line. As far as Sirius Black, Gary Oldman is a perfect actor to play a man who has spent 12 years in a horrific dungeon prison, who's mind borders on the brink of insanity, but who is also very passionate. I'd tell you more, but then I'd have to kill you, right? There wasn't as much new casting other than these major characters, who will now be with the show in the 4th and 5th installments, and likely further down the line.For those who enjoy fantasy, this is an excellent film and a great installment in the Harry Potter universe. If you're an adult, you will find your sense of wonder returning faster than ever.",9,0,0,6 June 2004
The Man Who Would Be King," Among my top 5 choices for best film!
","I beg to differ with one of the comments about this being a man's film!  I would place this film among my top 5 favorite movies of all time, and I am definitely NOT a man!This film is the epitome of everything that is good in a film.  Great locations, great direction, great art direction, great story, great plotting and most especially, great acting.Michael Caine and Sean Connery have done 'bigger' works, but together, they have made the 'biggest' work they could ever do.  The spirit and life in their characters--the sheer optimism that they show, even in the final scenes of the film are heart wrenching and beautiful.  They 'make' Daniel Dravot, Esquire and Peachy Carnehan come to beautiful life, embodying all that is innocent in two men who have been to war, conquered their demons, and now desire to fulfill the rest of their dreams.The underlying subplot of freemasonry is an interesting one as well.  For it would not have been out of character for men such as Danny and Peachy to have been masons, nor for Kipling to be one as well. (Did anyone ever note that this was Christopher Plummer's first of two roles that dealt quite a lot with freemasonry? Murder by Decree, four years later, is the other)I just love this movie for itself.  I've been a fan of H. Rider Haggard, and it's the same kind of thrill you get in reading his work.  I just HATED it when they started remaking the Haggard movies and putting women like Sharon Stone in them, when it's supposed to be a 'male' adventure.  You would certainly never find a woman like that in The Man Who Would Be King--it is the TRUE essence of a film about MEN in a MAN'S era.Michael Caine and Sean Connery are, for lack of a better word, geniuses in the art of filmmaking.  They have become true ACTORS, because they love their craft so much, and know the difference between acting and faking it. They are not out to prove themselves 'stars' because they don't need that--they know how to ACT and that is far more important.If any filmmaker now were to tackle a project such as The Man Who Would Be King, they would likely try to cast some big name 'star' such as Tom Cruise, and ruin the story.  Let's hope this film is NOT remade--it would certainly taint what is perhaps one of the few masterpieces of modern day story telling.",10,11,18,9 July 1999
From Hell," Okay Drama from What I Saw of it
","Perhaps it's because I didn't catch the whole film, but there didn't seem to be a whole heckuva lot new in this film that hasn't been said in other movies, and in better ways.  I like Depp, Holm, Coltrane and the other major performers for the most part, but I found Heather Graham too pretty to be playing a prostitute in Victorian England.  The thought that they were beautiful, relatively naive women is rather misleading.The film I found that handled many of the same theories, and in a lot better fashion, was Murder By Decree with Christopher Plummer and James Mason.  The whole angle of the Freemasons was pursued there, as well as the theory that the Royal Physician was the real Ripper.  The comments about the 'Juwes' was also given, connecting them directly to the Masons.  The thing is, Freemasonry was not (and still isn't) as well known as it appears to be in From Hell--it's preposterous that in that day, without the amount of knowledge and information as available as it is now, that every cop on the beat would know about it. Also, the film seems to have also read most of the same source material as Murder By Decree with Annie Crook and the illegitimate child fathered by the Royal family member. 
The ending was confusing, though perhaps as I said it was because I didn't see the beginning.Overall, I suppose I need to see the film from the start, but if there wasn't any significant revelations in the 2/3 of the film that I saw, I would say that seeing Murder By Decree again would be preferable.",Null,1,2,9 June 2004
The Da Vinci Code," A nice thriller from start to finish
","I went into the film cold, without having read the book, and I enjoyed it. It stands on its own, apart from the book, which I will likely read now to compare the two.The performances for the most part are understated, though at times the dialogue is too expository, and doesn't lead to any new actions, however much it gives background. I think that perhaps a rolling 'credits' scene in the beginning might have helped make some points clearer, though I can understand the need for the characters to learn new elements as the story moves forward.In comparison to other films in the 'treasure hunt' type of action films, it is a lot more cerebral, but whether that helps or not depends on your point of view! There is very little in the way of graphic violence, though there are some scenes which might frighten smaller children. There was also very little profanity. I could compare it with 'National Treasure' in some ways, but a 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' it isn't.The film (and obviously the book) pour down heavy criticism on certain historically religious groups, and I suppose this is one of the reasons why some are boycotting the film--however, since the whole thing has been designated fiction, I can't understand why people just don't accept it for just that--a 'fictional' story.The mood is dark, and there is some humor, too, though it's almost whispered at times. Perhaps this tone of 'reverence' is in the novel, too, I don't know; Ian McKellan's character is the only one audacious enough to laugh out loud.I recommend the film, but if people aren't prepared to check their own beliefs at the door, they might be disappointed in the film's outcome.",8,1,3,20 May 2006
