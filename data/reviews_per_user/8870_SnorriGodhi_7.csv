Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Travels into the Heart of America
","This movie includes both straight comedy and a kind of candid camera (the kind where the camera is visible, but the victim is unsuspecting). The comedy is merged with the candid-camera segments so well, that if you do not pay close attention you might forget that some of the people are not acting. Before going on, a few words about my background: most of my interactions with American people have been academic - meaning, I mostly interacted with American students and academics. As a consequence, I have come to see America as the land of political correctness and moral relativism. No doubt, mine is a biased point of view, but it's the point of view from which I saw this movie, and it must be mentioned.So this why this movie is interesting to me: there is this Borat character who pretends to be from a country that few of us know much about; he talks to a number of Americans from different backgrounds, in different contexts, and everything he says and does is very un-PC, if not plain offensive. How are Americans going to react? are they going to be PC and tolerate Borat because of his background? or are they going to reject him because he is not PC? or are they going to reveal their own un-PC prejudices when it is safe to do so?The answer is a bit of all three, of course; but, on the whole, the people meeting Borat make the best of a difficult situation. Usually they explain, politely but firmly, that certain things are not done in the USA. This is what the self-defined 'veteran feminists' do, for instance. Of course, it helps that they are 'veterans': modern Taliban-supporting American feminists would not dare to contradict a non-westerner, even if he says that women have small brains.In a way, it is disappointing that Americans behave in such a civilized way: Borat himself is always funny, but his victims are a bit too predictable. However, sometimes we see reactions ranging from the funny to the outrageous. For example, the scene in the gun shop is a hilarious double-act, with Borat as the comic and the shopkeeper a brilliant straight-man. Better than any single scene in 'Bowling for Columbine'.On the other hand, I found most offensive the attitudes of the college students who gave a ride to Borat. That's a relief: there are no more outrageous people in America than I met on campus! (update 2006.11.11: apparently the students sued the film studio.)There is much more in this movie, but I'll just give a warning: pay attention to how New Yorkers are much more wary of physical contact than people in other parts of the country.In conclusion, Borat put the American people to a harsh test, and they came out reasonably well, but not too boring. How would Europeans come out? I am not sure that I want to know. I take one star off the rating because the movie could have been even better with more candid-camera and less straight comedy.",7,5,14,12 October 2006
The Man Who Would Be King," An awesome combination of adventure, comedy, and Shakespearean tragedy
","This movie is loosely based on the Kipling short story by the same title, but for once the adaptation is a big improvement. In the short story, there is much less character development, and the Daniel character is allowed to dominate; in the movie, the two main characters get a fairly balanced exposure.The result is one of the great adventure stories, and at the same time a great Shakespearean tragedy. In this respect, it can be compared to that other Huston masterpiece: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.Yet, even this high praise does not do full justice to the movie, because I have not yet mentioned the scenery, the music, and, most important, the two unforgettable main characters. Daniel and Peachy are crooks and megalomaniacs, but, on the whole, it is hard not to sympathize with them: because it's only a movie, of course, but also because of their quiet self-confidence and dry sense of humor; because they do not lose dignity in failure; and because, for all their flaws, one can sense that they have lived interesting lives, and wishes to hear them tell their stories.Sometimes Daniel and Peachy treat the natives pretty shabbily, but only on one occasion I thought that they would behave differently to a white man. This occasion, unfortunately, is at the very beginning of the movie, in the train scene. You should not let this scene alienate you from the Peachy character, because you won't see him behave like that again.There are a few remarks that might offend the overly sensitive, such as: '(we are) not gods, but Englishmen, which is the next best thing!'. (Incidentally, this might have been inspired by Cecil Rhodes.) But this remark should be seen in its context. It is pretty clear that Daniel and Peachy believe themselves to be close to gods, not because they are British, but because they are Daniel and Peachy. They are quite happy to make fun of their fellow Britons and of the entire colonial enterprise: witness lines such as 'It was detriment like us that built this bloody Empire!' or 'We are going to teach you (...) to slaughter your enemies like civilized men.'From their talk to Kipling and to the District Commissioner, one gets pretty soon the picture of the individualistic, libertarian philosophy of Daniel and Peachy. Perhaps this is best encapsulated in their conversation when they are trapped at high altitude and expect to die from exposure. They consider whether their lives have been wasted, and decide that they would not go back even on the point of dying, if that means giving up on their memories. Without giving anything away, I can say that their best memories were yet to come.",10,1,3,30 May 2006
A Clockwork Orange," That Chaplain sticks in my throat
","One problem with this movie is that senseless violence is depicted as glamorous. (This is obviously less of a problem after Pulp Fiction and Sin City.) Speaking for myself, I find this to be only a minor problem.My main problem is different: the movie raises an important issue, but deals with it in a confused and illogical manner. The issue is whether something like the Ludovico treatment, if feasible, would be ethical. For those who have not yet seen the movie, the Ludovico treatment is a (fictional) conditioning process, by which a violent criminal comes to associate the sight of violence with strong nausea. The purpose is to make the criminal practically unable to use violence ever again.Presumably, the Prison Chaplain speaks for Burgess and Kubrick when he complains that the Ludovico treatment is unethical because it robs the patient of his free will: the patient avoids violence because he fears nausea, not because he has changed his ethical outlook.What the Chaplain says is well phrased, as can be seen in the 'memorable quotes' section. It is also very silly. It is silly because it assumes that people who try to avoid nausea have lost their free will.Imagine a criminal who has been to jail and has abandoned crime because he fears going back to jail: does this mean that the threat of jail deprives people of their free will? Imagine also a man who experiences nausea after tasting Bearnaise sauce in a restaurant: this man is unlikely to eat Bearnaise sauce again, but can he sue the restaurant for depriving him of his free will (as opposed to suing for food poisoning)? If the answer to both questions is no, then a man who abandons crime because he fears nausea has not lost his free will, either.On the other hand, if the answer to either question is yes, that means that people lose their free will when they have to suffer the consequences of their actions. So this is what the Chaplain's tirade amounts to: there is no free will if people suffer any consequences from their actions; and therefore there is no free will in the real world. It sounds absurd if put in these words, but this is the only way I can make sense of what the Chaplain says.It might be argued that there is a qualitative difference between fear of prison and nausea: the two emotions activate different brain pathways, for instance. There can be reasonable disagreement on the differences between the Ludovico treatment and prison, and there is plenty of room for debate on this issue. The fact is that the movie does not even begin to address the issue! The Chaplain does not explain why he is opposed to the Ludovico treatment, but not to prison. Nothing in the movie suggests any reason to prefer prison to the Ludovico treatment; if anything, the Ludovico treatment is portrayed as faster and more effective in reducing crime. This brings me back full circle to my starting point: the movie raises an important issue, but deals with it in a confused and illogical manner.In spite of all this, I was entertained by the movie: there is an interesting story and stylish cinematography, as one would expect from Kubrick. The violence is unpleasant, but it is not gratuitous: it shows what kind of person the main character is, and what kind of people he hangs around with. But at the end of the movie, what remains in my mind, and sticks in my throat, is the Chaplain's speech. I perceive it as an insult to the intelligence of the audience. Should I be more disturbed by the violence? I don't think so, because the violence is fictional, while the silly ideas that the Chaplain is advocating can do serious damage to an impressionable mind.",2,7,15,30 May 2006
The Deer Hunter," Major flaws, with a long movie wrapped around them
","Clearly, there are many people who value this movie. I have no problem admitting that I just 'don't get it' -- as long as those who like this movie are open to the idea that, just possibly, there is an elephant in the room that they are overlooking. Actually, from some other comments, it looks like some other people have seen the elephant, but think that it fits well into the room.My case rests on the fact that this is meant to be a 'serious' movie, but I have had less trouble suspending disbelief with the X-Men than with this movie: if the main characters had escaped from the Vietcongs using their super-powers, that would have left me less uncomfortable than what I have seen in this movie.Some other IMDb reviewers have mentioned the extreme improbability of Nick making a living out of playing Russian roulette professionally. But the weirdness does not end there, because his buddy Michael returns to Vietnam to rescue him from his insanity. How? why, by playing Russian roulette with him, of course! You might think that this is the action least likely to bring the two of them back together to the USA -- and you would be right, because Nick shoots himself during the game. The way it looks to me is that Michael unwittingly ends Nick's successful career.The earlier escape scene is also absurd. It makes sense that Michael and Nick plan to escape by using the gun they are supposed to play Russian roulette with. It makes sense that they figure they need three bullets to escape. It might even make sense that, before starting to fire at the Vietcongs, they want to be sure that the next chamber has a bullet in it (although the way they make sure would mean a very likely failure for their plan, in real life). But why did the Vietcongs let them keep a gun with three bullets ready to be fired? The escape plan boils down to hoping that the Vietcongs will let them keep a loaded gun, if they survive Russian roulette. Nothing wrong with trying; but the scriptwriters should not have allowed them to survive both the odds of Russian roulette and the odds that at least one of the Vietcongs would use his brain.The Russian roulette scenes are surreal. Watching them, I could feel no suspense whatsoever, in spite of the characters screaming themselves hoarse: I simply could not suspend my disbelief. I had the uncomfortable feeling of missing something: perhaps they were playing some other game that looks a lot like Russian roulette, except that the person with the gun knows whether the next chamber has a cartridge in it. That might help to explain both the escape from the Vietcongs and Nick's survival as a professional player, but it would introduce other difficulties, such as Nick shooting himself.Now, all of the above comments are about the Russian roulette scenes, and it might be said that i am overlooking the rest of the movie: that this is not a war movie, but a movie about the trauma of war. Maybe so, but suppose that you had seen the movie without the Russian roulette scenes: would you think that the movie could be improved by adding a few silly scenes?For me, the addition of silly scenes means that i must take away one or two points from my rating. My rating is already pretty low because I 'don't get' the rest of the movie, and in addition because I had high expectations for this movie and was disappointed; so i am giving the minimum rating to the movie as a whole.",1,71,137,5 July 2006
Munich," Hamlet in Tel Aviv
","As a thriller, 'Munich' works very well. Unfortunately, Kushner, Roth, and Spielberg felt the need to overlay the thriller with a political statement. Thus, we are faced with an assassin who talks like Hamlet, because he has to talk for Kushner & Co. It is difficult to get involved in an action movie when even the main character's heart is not in it.At the beginning of the movie, Avner (the main character) is offered a clear choice: to join the mission or not; and he decides to join. Then, after killing his first target, he begins to feel moral qualms. Some of his team mates react in the same way. Nothing strange about that, and yet their crisis of conscience does not seem sincere: their words and actions hardly betray any feelings about killing. Instead, they talk about the abstract morality of their mission, and its likely consequences. They are almost too cerebral to be recognizable as human characters. They do not amount to much as philosophers, either. Their discussions offer no more insight than: killing is bad.To be fair to this Hamletic hit squad, part of their problem is that they are faced by conflicting information: first they are told that new terrorists are recruited by terrorist attacks, like Munich; later they are told, or tell themselves, that killing terrorists creates more terrorists. Damned if you don't, and damned if you do.This cognitive dissonance takes its toll on Avner. In one scene, he empathizes with a terrorist who wants to kick all Jews out of Palestine. In another scene, flashbacks of his terrifying experience in Munich do nothing to inhibit his sexual performance. A psychiatrist could make a career out of studying this guy!Once more, apart from the psychological flaws, the movie is actually very good. The logic of Avner wanting to take part in the Beirut operation is pretty shaky (did Avner want his informers to know that he was in it, or not? and why go there in either case?); the way Avner buys information looks too easy to be true; but otherwise I found the plot believable. Even the physics is realistic: nobody flies off backwards when hit by a bullet, for instance. It would have been a great movie if Kushner & Co. had allowed the story to speak for itself.As a footnote, the statement 'Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values' (see memorable quotes) is questionable. It is hard to believe that the ancient Mongols or the Vikings ever had to compromise their values. The Icelandic sagas show that the 'cycle of violence' is easily broken, when both sides accept that the other side is going to stand up for its rights. Genghis Khan had his own (quite effective) way to break the 'cycle of violence'. Maybe the Viking and ancient Mongol cultures do not count as civilizations, but even so, they are still valid as proof of concept; so it would have made more sense to say: 'Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own unrealistic expectations'. But then the statement becomes a tautology.",7,5,9,30 May 2006
Heat," Excellent at several levels
","There are some movies that I remember first of all for a single message. The first thing I remember from High Noon is the reason Will Kane won't run away; from Conan the Barbarian, it's Conan's prayer before the Battle of the Mounds; from Excalibur, it's that danger always comes from where you least expect it.From Heat, the first thing I remember is 'Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat, if you feel the heat around the corner.' I have had reason to think about it many times since I first saw this movie. (Though fortunately I have had no reason to act on it, yet.) For sure, there are other good things about the movie. There are the action scenes, some of which have a connection to the '30 seconds flat' message. Wrapped around that, there is the drama; depending on taste, 3 hours of it might be too long, but it felt just right for me.On the negative side, it is hard to sympathize with any of the characters -- but is that really a negative? maybe it is better to watch the movie with detachment.What makes this movie great is that it all comes together: the plot; the action scenes; and the message that, just possibly, you might have to give up on anything you hold dear: not just for your own good, but also for the good of the very people you hold dear.",10,1,3,19 August 2010
V for Vendetta," Style without substance
","It seems appropriate that the 1812 overture is part of the soundtrack for this movie: Tchaikovsky might dazzle for a short while, but you wouldn't want to listen to it for over two hours.Even those who have not yet seen the movie, probably know that the Wachowski brothers have jumped on the anti-Bush bandwagon. The political message is not too blatant, but knowing about it helps to understand the symbolism.The movie is set in a future dystopian Britain (confusingly called 'England': perhaps Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have become independent?). There is a second civil war in the USA, and 'England' has fallen under a dictatorship with Christian theocratic overtones. By the look of the regime logo, the official religion seems to be Eastern Orthodoxy.For some reason, the title character thinks that blowing up the Old Bailey and the Houses of Parliament would help to restore the rule of law and democracy. He styles himself after Guy Fawkes, a Catholic terrorist who tried to blow up Parliament with everybody inside.Actually, the entire script appears to be written in blissful ignorance of the real world. For example, the dictatorship bans the Koran. What are the reactions of the 1.6 million Muslims in Britain? the movie does not acknowledge that they even exist. Another example: the movie opens with a British televangelist saying that America has fallen because it is more Godless than Britain.The internal logic of the movie world is just as shaky. The regime is only nominally Christian, so why does it waste police resources in persecuting apolitical homosexuals? and why does it impose a late-night curfew?It gets worse. One might think that an American civil war would generate enough fear to sustain a few dozen dictatorships, but the British regime fakes a few terrorist attacks for good measure. This conspiracy looks useless twice over when it transpires that people do not believe in the regime propaganda.On the other hand, people immediately believe the first TV broadcast from a masked man who speaks against the government without offering any evidence whatsoever. This is what I call the 'Running Man' plot device: an anti-government video is shown on prime time TV, and popular opinion is immediately turned around. It is becoming a popular plot device.One might also wonder why V prefers knifes to guns, or how he manages to live in style in the very center of London, but this is nitpicking.There is a pretense that the plot devised by V is very clever. To support this idea, we are shown how very clever he is with falling dominoes. In practice, the entire scheme devised by V can be reduced to the following:BEGIN SPOILERS: The regime Security Chief has been plotting to murder the Dictator and take his place; V asks the Security Chief to carry out the execution in front of him; the Chief obliges (for reasons known only to him); finally, V kills the Security Chief. Incidentally, this is the only significant action scene, and it is poorly choreographed: the Chief's bodyguards stand like mannequins, waiting for their throats to be cut. END SPOILERSThis is not much of a plot, so it had to be padded with a revenge sub-plot, some prison scenes, and some explosions.In summary, this movie has two confused and illogical plots (the movie plot and V's own plot) which show no knowledge of the real world; and no points of interest other than a character with a cool costume. If you want to see what life might be like under a modern theocracy, see The Handmaid's Tale: it has a low-budget look, but what do you expect in a theocracy? If you want a well-told dark story with a masked super-hero, see Batman Begins. And if you want exciting sci-fi action with a decent plot, see Terminator 2: Judgment Day.",1,48,101,29 May 2006
