Skyfall," Three Words: Bond Is Back
","Without a doubt, one of the best Bond Films, certainly the best bond film in the more recent years (only *possibly* topped by something like Goldfinger, You Only live twice or any of the 'classics'), but certainly highly entertaining, and for many reasons.The first thing I would like to mention is the films musical score, which so brilliantly compliments the film, but what is most enjoyable about it is the fact you hear the bond theme! Yes Ladies, Gentlemen and anything in between, you here the good ol' fashioned Dumm, Dumm, Dumm, Dumm...with interjections of the Skyfall main theme song (again, Fantastic! So much better than Quantum of Solace's main theme)Another fantastic thing about the film is how sexy it looks. Genuinely, it looks amazing. The cinematography is just simply perfect (Watch out for the China scene, the opening shot, and generally all the establishing shots)I am sorry that the previous two things have only been brief so far, but that is because I want to talk more about two things: The story, and Javier Bardem.Now the story is one that is simple, Good guys lose something that bad guys use to damage good guys. Good guys get revenge, everyone ends up happy. Ish. But what is so beautiful about this film is how you see the relationship between M and 007 develop, you have so much of the film invested in their life stories (You hear about M's husband, 007s parents and some of the problems in Bonds life as well i.e. drug and alcohol addiction) but the risk with so much time is spent on developing each character is you lose interest in the story. This is brilliantly avoided by having a perfect amount of large set action pieces such as the opening chase sequence, the tube line chase, the casino in china, and the finale which is EPIC (unlike QOS, which had too many forgettable flashes of action). This is so evenly dispersed throughout that you never for one second thing it is dragging or paced slowly. The 165 minutes just fly by. The other amazing thing about the story is the introduction of characters, such as Q, Money penny, and Silva.Now, if there isn't at least any major recognition for JB on this film, there is no justice in the world. I genuinely think he is the most likable bond villain, but at the same time just terrifying. Reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker. There are so many great moments and lines from JB, that makes you want to like him, but he will go ahead and do something truly brutal and horrifying (You'll know what I mean), and do it all with a smile on his face. Genuinely terrifying. I could go on and on about it, but alas my limit is near.In short, I would say if you had to see one film this autumn/fall, this would be it. A serious Oscar contender. A must watch for any Bond fan/Not a bond fan/everyone.Well done Sam Rami (again, Kudos to him for an amazing job!)Too much to say in 1000 letters...",10,2,15,1 November 2012
