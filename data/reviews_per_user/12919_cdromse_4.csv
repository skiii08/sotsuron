Blade Runner 2049," Get This Into Your Heads Hollywood: Your Sequels Are Moronic
",Would it kill you to not make a sequel for once?Some will notice that the movie does not need to exist. And surely that is obvious. But still they could have used better pacing and more logic.I did find a starlet as the woman was superbly pretty.,3,62,101,2 December 2019
Train to Busan," Very Good Film
","I am not sure this film is as perfect a many reviewers say, but I like it and like it very much.
To get them out of the way the zombies are not archetypal, the tunnels are entirely too long and of course zombies are supposed to have been dead and buried first.
That aside, I am loving the action, appreciate the violence and I am glad many reviewers recognize the beauty of the women. Realizing and appreciating the feminine wiles of the actresses is being respectful and being natural. This film offers a great nod to nature and the sexy schoolgirl is just a 10/10.",8,87,119,2 December 2019

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Disney is fooling you
","First of all, a Star Wars fan here. This should've been arrested and not released by a QA team. Second of all movie is pathetic, waste of time...Star Wars and the force with a boy who keeps taking his mask off give me a brake",2,8,13,2 December 2019
