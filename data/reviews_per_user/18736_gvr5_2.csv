Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I wanted to like it, but it was too pretentious/bogus
","Basically a suckfest.The first kept me interested - but the conclusion just confirmed my fear that I'd lost something like 5 hours to this pile of pretentious drivel.
I did enjoy Daryl Hannah, but the rest --- ugh! Madsen, Carradine, Thurman, Tarantino---- I expected better.
Bill was just too full of himself for me to care whether he lived or died - and Beatrice - well same thing.  There was no one to like, and really no one worth hating.  Without either emotion, I'm stuck praying that the credits won't be too far off.I'll be missing Kill Bill 3 - I'd rather have a root canal.",1,22,43,6 May 2004
Requiem for a Dream," Watching it, took my breath and hope away - but then
","I guess that was the purpose.  It's a movie, a moment in time that actually pulsates.  But what a moment!  I feel like someone shared something important, dangerous and frightening.  Something that I'll never forget, and hopefully never experience.watch it",Null,0,0,10 August 2001
