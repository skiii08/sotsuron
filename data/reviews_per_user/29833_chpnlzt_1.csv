The New World," Music used in 'NEW WORLD'
","The two main pieces of the movie that the director ripped off were by Wagner and Mozart - the director should be barred from making any more movies since he ripped off these geniuses in such a cheesy way - the Mozart rip-off wasn't so bad as the Wagner where he uses the one note theme from the beginning of one of Wagner's operas and it is held for several minutes and then cut off before it is allowed to resolve - I could have grabbed him by the neck and strangled him right through the screen - but then he proceeded to use the same unresolved fragment to do the same thing two more times for a total of three times. The orchestra builds and builds around a single note, but this colossal idiot of a director leaves us hanging unresolved, much like his entire movie.As far as the previews, I never watch them, so I don't know what was used - I can't watch them since the idiots who put them together give away everything especially the punch lines.",4,0,8,29 January 2006
