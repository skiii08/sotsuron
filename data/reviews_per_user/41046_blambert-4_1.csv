Walk the Line," unexpectedly good!
","I'm not a fan of musicals or musicians generally,they get too much attention for very little 'work' in my view. And while I'm aware of Johnny Cash's music and think it's fine I've never owned one of his records. But I was very pleasantly surprised how much I liked this movie. Phoenix and Witherspoon are terrific and it's because they aren't doing 'impressions'. I've always liked Phoenix ever since he was in Gladiator and think he is a very good.actor. This film blows away anything his brother River ever did. And Witherspoon;cute but that's about it. But in this movie it's THEM singing and their isn't anything 'cutsey' about this movie. Both characters are flawed, hurt others, hurt themselves but its pretty clear they belong together. I went to see this thinking if it was a '5' I'd be happy but it was a '10' easy.",10,1,3,27 November 2005
