Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," GREAT MOVIE!! ;but my favorite is still the Empire Strikes back;
","This movie is incredibly awesome and entertaining.  As a huge and completely devoted fan anything that even remotely says anything about Star Wars deserves a good look over.  This movie is incredibly stimulating in the special effects department but my favorite movie is still the Empire Strikes Back.  This movie will take a while to get used to, and the story in the Empire Strikes back makes more sense but who goes to Star Wars for the story!?",10,0,0,22 May 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Funny, Smart, Kubrick
","All of Stanley Kubrick's films have a certain charm.... This one is no exception.  Its charm is of humor and seriousness.  Lines like 'There's no fighting in the War Room!' makes a person laugh and use it as a sort of 'inside joke' between people who have seen the movie.  The only problem is that children around the age of 12 and 13 and younger and possibly older will become restless and fidget for, by today's standards, this movie is slow paced.  But definitely not as much as 2001: A Space Odyssey (yawn)",8,0,1,3 June 1999
Aliens," James Cameron's best film, DVD
","Although I really hate the movie Titanic, I must say that James Cameron's 'Aliens' is positively the best in the Alien's legacy. It has the best lines (amazing that James wrote this isn't it?), the best story, the best effects, and no doubt the best characters. My family and I got the Aliens DVD and it has scenes never before seen.  It has seens from the colony before the Alien's attack and even shows Newt and her family.  It also has things about Ripley's daughter and Hick's and Ripley's first names.  So if you do have a DVD and you enjoy this movie I would definitely recommend you get it on DVD.",10,7,11,5 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Great film, poor acting
","Star Wars: A New Hope is a great film.  It started the whole Star Wars universe (that is for all of us who aren't George Lucas) and gave us a look into a primitive futuristic past.  I, being a die hard Star Wars fan, believe that anything that is remotely related to Star Wars deserves a good look over and this definitely beats a lot of other movies to the top.  The only thing that I can fine wrong is the acting.  Most of the actors have gone on and improved very much in their acting abilities like Harrison Ford. But in the beginning he was not very good in fact I would even call his acting stiff.  But we should give him a break because, this was his second movie after 'American Grafitti.'  The only thing that got on my nerves throughout the whole movie was how whiney Luke is.  Lines like 'Uncle Owen, Uncle Owen??' are screamed at a whiney high pitched voice.  But otherwise a great film.",10,4,6,3 June 1999
