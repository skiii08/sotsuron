It," Goonies/stranger things
","There are some scathing reviews on here which I don't think are justified. I think if you want to watch something fun with that 80s kid film feel but with a few moments that make you jump then it's a cracking film. Some people have complained about the storyline, but I think for a film like this is doesn't need a watertight backstory. And I think it's clear that this is only round one. Plenty of time in the sequel to address that.",9,0,2,9 June 2018
