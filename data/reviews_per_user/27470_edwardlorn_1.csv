Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Terrible acting throughout.
","If this were not Star Wars this film would never have made it past direct-to- video or Syfy markets. The kid who plays Anakin is the worst offender, but even skilled actors like Liam and Ewan and Natalie give lifeless performances. The story is full of holes and the bad guys pose little threat. I recently rewatched this with my kids in anticipation of Episode 7. During the final battle, when Anakin destroys the space station and all the droids power down, Jar Jar bops one of the droids on the head and its head tumbles off. My ten-year-old daughter said, 'What? Huh? When my toys' batteries dies they don't just fall apart. Why'd the droid's head fall off?' I had no answer because there is no logical explanation for this. Same goes for much of this pile of excrement.",1,0,4,7 December 2015
