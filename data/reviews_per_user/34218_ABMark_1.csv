Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Star Wars for the '90's and beyond.
","This is a good movie, no doubt about that. Visually stunning, and while the story is loaded with exposition, there is plenty of good action. Lightsabre action, pod racing, underwater civilization. There's some characters I like better than others, some who won't be in the next movie even though I'd've liked them to be and others that I just didn't like. All in all this is a good watch, and I will see it again soon (Preferably before midnight, the next time). And I think there's a tip of the hat to Kevin Smith (Chasing Amy) in there",6,0,1,19 May 1999
