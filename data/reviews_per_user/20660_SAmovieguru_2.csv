50 First Dates," One of my absolute favorites!
","I love this movie, if you are in the mood for something funny, entertaining and sweet, this is for you. This romantic comedy is about a woman, Lucy, who has an accident and loses her memory and every day onwards her mind resets at the end of the day. She doesn't remember the people she meets after her accident. One day she meets Henry, and it then becomes Henry's daily mission to see Lucy and take her out. In true Adam Sandler style, he is entertaining and endearing, and his character spends his time trying to convince Lucy's family and friends that he has her best interests at heart! It's lighthearted, and entertaining, and for anyone looking for something to make them laugh and smile, it is highly recommended.",8,0,0,21 April 2011
Limitless," Highly engaging, worth the watch!
","I went to see this movie with no expectations, and not knowing what it was about, which I rarely do and found it thoroughly enjoyable.The storyline takes a couple minutes before the action starts but from 5 minutes in, I was captivated. It plays into the human desire of wanting to be highly intelligent, knowledgeable and in turn successful. This movie exposes you to both the positives and negatives that come with great intelligence and great success, as you see contrasting characters, all experiencing higher intelligence than usual but this is not in depth, and you only really get a feel for Bradley Cooper's experience.For some parts of the movie, it feels as though, Bradley Cooper is the only actor in this movie, as it focuses primarily on him as he thrives and struggles with the dilemma on super intelligence, and his quest to get the pill which grants him this. But holds your interest throughout.I found the ending unpredictable, and it kept me on my toes throughout! Very enjoyable!For those, who don't enjoy movies where the camera filming moves and spans at speed, there are a few moments when you may feel sick or struggle to watch and need to look away, this is more in the beginning and shouldn't detract from your enjoyment of the movie.",7,0,1,21 April 2011
