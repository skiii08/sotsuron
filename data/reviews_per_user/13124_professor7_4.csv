Skyfall," Worst Bond Movie EVER!!!
","I don't understand why this movie is so highly rated. The plot was copied from MI 1. Every character in the Movie is a Failure. The bad guy basically wins in the end.This didn't feel like a Bond movie in any way. There was no fun. It was all dark and doom and gloom. The writer doesn't understand computers, tactics, security, or networking. The only way to enjoy this movie is to put on your dumb hat.In the end though who wants to watch a bunch of failures.Q fails to secure MI6 networks allowing the bad guy to hack them 4 times. I'm sorry what idiot would plugs a captured computer into your live network. You create a segmented network for working on captured computers.M fails to have people who understand computer security to prevent them from being hacked. Maybe if she'd hired a Q that was older than 5 they would not have gotten hacked. Not to mention she made a bad call that nearly got Bond killed and lost them the Spy List. Why not tell Bond to duck, or the shooter to fire until they where both dead.Bond is supposed to protect M at the end and she dies. HE FAILED.What was good about this movie? Again have to say WORST BOND MOVIE EVER!!!!!",1,8,23,6 February 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," My Heart Sank!!!!
",I loved the book The Hobbit. One of the best parts of the book is Bilbo outsmarting the Dragon to show it's weak spot. My Heart Sank as I watch the best parts of the Book Rewriten into nothingness. Peter Jackson seems to have to respect for the books that he is translating into movies. All I can say after Lord of the Rings and now the Hobbit is that Peter Jackson's goal was to rewrite and change These beloved story's.I was very disappointed by this movie. I doubt I'll bother to watch the last one.So Sad! So Sad!! :(,2,31,51,20 December 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Best Book Adaption I've Ever Seen & A Great MOVIE!!!!!!
",Peter Jackson has made what I would say is the one of the closes book adaptions I've ever seen. This movie is based on one of my favorite books and Peter Jackson has brought it to life. I read some of the critic's reviews and I'll have to say is they need go read a book and learn about story telling again. Wow the critics really don't know what they are talking about in any way. My kids loved the movie and so did I. I plan to go see it again. If only every book that has been made into a movie received such love. I do so hope the next 2 parts are done as well as this one. I watched in 2D not sure about the camera's used but it wasn't as bad as I heard. GREAT GREAT GREAT MOVIE!!!!!! Peter Jackson DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE CRITICS follow the books and make movie HISTORY!!!,10,7,18,17 December 2012
The Wolverine," Ug! From Camera Work to Plot this was really bad!
","All that money and they couldn't afford to keep the camera still? When I go to a movie! I want to WATCH the action. If the camera shakes non- stop you can't see much. I have to admit the action was so badly filmed I almost walked out of the movie.I would have to say after watching this movie I don't feel 20th Century understands comics or the X-Men. Until Marvel can get the rights to the X-Men back I'm done. 20th Century sucks, they don't understand the material and they don't understand the characters. This movie was boring with unwatchable action and no emotion. Taking plot points from the very flawed and horrible X-Men 3 sucked the life out of a good story. Please 20th Century, stop making Wolverine and X- Men movies. Please Please.So Sad",1,13,31,28 July 2013
