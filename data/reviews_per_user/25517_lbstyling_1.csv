First Man," Almost Perfect.
","I'm not sure which movie some people saw, but am convinced that they couldn't have been watching the same movie as me.This was no apollo 13 with glitzy lighting, this was the real thing. As real as it gets on film. As long as you are not going in expecting the latest Marvel film, your good. Clear inspiration from Interstellar/Space Odessey 2001 can be drawn at several points in the film- no bad thing in my book.Time is taken to remind the audience of basic facts oft forgotten by time- Although initially very popular, the space programme was an emmence cost, just how out of favor that the programme had become by the time Apollo 11 flew, just how likely it was that anyone could make it back alive, how close Armstrong came to aborting due to fuel, how armstrong broke rules, but only when he had earned the right too. Several pilots died in testing to even get to the point of the Apollo 11 flight, each time it happened, these guys only became more convinced that they had to finish what they started.
Gosling was the perfect man to play Armstrong. Yes, the strong silent type, but more than that, as explained in the film, the man knew what REAL responsibility felt like, and he didn't crumble, not one inch. He was as likely as not to be going to his death on the mission. but he was an engineer, no maverick, yet when push came to shove, the guy just did what had to be done, whatever the cost.",9,0,1,3 January 2019
