Hereditary," If you like blood and guts in your horror
","Don't see this movie. If you like a horror film with psychological tension laced with a bit of confusion and room for interpretation, this movie is for you. I personally prefer that sort of horror over the mess that's been coming out these days. It's worth a watch. The performances are great.",7,2,5,9 July 2018
