Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as bad, but could have been better
","I saw this film when it first came out in 1999. A lot of people talk down about this saying that it was not good at all. I think the film was alright, I mean it could have been better with some parts, but overall it was good.This film now goes back and stars back when Anakin is young boy, being discovered by two Jedis and is sent to the Jedi council sensing that he is strong in the force.There were some problems with this film, mainly Jar-Jar Binks, who is more annoying than some people I know in life. The fight scenes are done and some of the best around.If you get past the bad hype given to this film, you will find out that it is an alright film to watch.",8,9,12,22 December 2006
Kickboxer," A good movie
","This is one of Van Damme's better movies. This movie is about Eric Sloan World Heavyweight champion, and his brother Kurt Sloan go to Thailand to fight. Eric loses his match is crippled by Tong Po the Thai champion.This is one of the better 80's martial arts movies. Van Damme does pretty good in this movie, even though he a fraud and NEVER once fought in the ring a day in his life. A rare film appearance by Dennis Alexio, one of the best Super heavyweight kick boxers of all time. Dennis does fairly well in this film. It seemed to me that Eric Sloan attitude was similar to Dennis Alexio's attitude in real life. Cocky and a little bit over confident.The fight scenes were done very well along with the training scenes. Overall this is a good film, for any martial arts fan to enjoy.",6,1,1,17 December 2006
Rocky V," Good, but not the best
","Usually as a film has more sequels the later sequels tend to less than good. Most people will tell you that Rocky V falls under this group. Most people also say that Rocky V was the worst Rocky movie out there. In my opinion Rocky V is not as bad as it sound.This movie takes place about a week or so after the events of Rocky IV. Rocky loses all of his money and his other items, when his brother-in-law makes a bad choices and give power of attorney to their accountant who takes all of Rocky's money. Rocky also learns that he has brain damage and thus can no longer fight. Rocky moves into his brother in law's old house and starts running Mick's old gym. Around this time, Rocky meets a young boxer named Tommy Gunn who wants to train under Rocky. Tommy who can fight well, has the heart about the size of a dime.Most people were disappointed to find out that Rocky does not have some high profile fight. The acting at times could also leave somethings to be desired. Tommy Morrison about 60 percent or more of the times makes his character seem wooden, and leaves a lot in the character development department.Another thing that gripes me about this film is putting Sylvester Stallone's real life son as Rocky's son in the movie. Why do I have a gripe about this I will explain. Now it's understandable that the actor who played Rocky's son in the 4th film could not be his son in this film, as he would have age and gotten older, but in Rokcy IV, Rocky's son is supposed to be like 10 or something. When Sage Stallone comes in to the picture he now looks like he is 15. So did his movie son magically age 5 years in a matter of a week? I highly doubt that.Overall with the gripes that I have about this film it's not a bad film. If you have watched the previous Rocky films then watch this, you won't regret it.",6,3,3,21 December 2006
Ed Wood," Good film, but a few things off from perfection
","I bought this film a few days ago and I decided to watch it last night. I know this film did not do to well in the box office, but I think it was because not many people have heard of Ed Wood Jr. at the time, nor were fans of his films. This film is biography of the late Ed Wood Jr the worst film director of all time and his struggle to make it to the top of the film industry world.Now I do have some issues with this film, mainly some miscasting. Sarah Jessica Parker in my opinion could not bring the emotion and feeling of Dolores Fuller. The best quote from her in the film is 'Do I really look like a horse?' It's the best quote from her because it's true Sarah Jessica Parker does look like a horse in this film. While I am a fan of Jeffrey Jones (Ferris Buller's Day Off, Howard the Duck, etc.) I just could not feel him become Criswell. I think Mr. Jones may I have tried to hard to try to be like Criswell, which really hurt his performance.While there were some miscasting problems, there were some actors who really hit the part right. Johhny Depp in my eyes became Ed Wood Jr. and I could just almost the spirit of Ed Wood Jr. in Mr. Depp. I also felt that Martin Landau become Bela Lugosi and in my opinion I though My Lugosi came back from the dead just to do his own part in this film.Overall if you are a fan of Ed Wood Jr. films then you should give this film a chance. It gives you an in site to his weird and wacky world of film making.",8,0,1,29 March 2007
My Neighbor Totoro," A Fantastic film that is a must watch
","Over the years my taste in movies changed from kid movies, to more adult (not porn) based films. I will still watch a kid's movie know and then if I have heard that it is really good or really funny. I became of fan of Anime movies some years ago, and was hoping to see more in my life time. I read a lot about Grave of the Fireflies and upon watching it, made me feel human again. I heard about Tonari no Totoro around the same time I heard of Grave of the Fireflies, however I did not have the money to obtain Tonari no Totoro.I had the chance to watch this film and loved it when I watched it. Basically the film is about a family, two sisters and their father who move into a new house. The sisters see this spirit who takes them throughout the forest and other parts of the land.The story is well told and the animation is top notch.If you like cute stories like this, then watch this film..",9,1,3,8 August 2007
Rocky II," Awesome sequel
","I watched Rocky II for the first time a few weeks ago, and this film was better than the first one. While most sequels are poorly done and in general are horrible, this one was very good.After the fight with Apollo, Rocky decides to retire, and he marries Adrian. When the fans think that the Rocky and Apollo fight is fixed, Apollo decides for him and Rocky to fight again.Rocky tries to support his family by taking regular jobs, but loses his job when they cut back production.The fight scenes were awesome, and there is a lot of good dialog in the film that makes it a good film to watch.The Rocky series is good and if you have watched the first one, watch this as you will not be disappointed.",7,0,0,18 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not as bad as you think
","As with TPM, most critics bashed this film as well. Again don't believe what the critics tell you about this film.Basically the film starts 10 years or so after TPM ends. Now Anakin is older and is a padawan under Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin also runs into Padame again, and falls in love with her.A lot of people will tell that there are a lot problems with this film and the other prequel films. I mean, the original Star Wars movies, were no Broadway musical, but in their own right were awesome. The same goes for the prequel films. Whlie they all have their own little problems, overall they are good films.The acting is well done for the most part, while there are some cheesy lines in the film. The light saber fights are preformed very well.So please just give this movie a try, you might like it.",7,2,2,26 January 2007
Forrest Gump," Easily one of Tom Hank's greatest roles ever
","I enjoy Tom Hank's film (Philadephia). He adds a certain touch to the films that others do not bring. I have always enjoyed Forrest Gump and it's one of my favorite films of all times.The film is about a man named Forrest Gump a man who is not the sharpest knife in the draw tells various people about his life, and the historical events that he lived though, along with the famous people he meets.The script itself is very well written and the actors and actresses seem very real and very likable. The only thing I was not fairly happy for was that Forrest was able to see famous events in history (Watergate, etc.) Overall I consider this one of my favorite films of all times. When I feel I need to watch a good film, this is one of them. If you have not seen this film then either rent it, buy it, or watch it on TV since it seems to be on quite often.",8,1,3,8 October 2007
The Godfather: Part II," Best movie I have ever seen
","I got the privilege to watch this film for the first last a few days ago. This has to be my favorite film of all time, along with one of the best films that I have ever seen.The movie does very well in shown two different two stories in one movie. You have Michael's story of which shows his struggle in controlling one of the most powerful crime families in the United States. The second story is Vito Corleone's struggle as young boy in Sicily growing up and coming to America, and his start of the Corleone crime family.This is a long film to watch, it took me a few days to watch it, as I watched about 30 to 40 minutes at a time.All of the actor and actresses preformed there roles very well, and the actors and actresses who got Oscars for their roles in this movie were VERY WELL deserved. Robert De Niro does one of the best acting jobs I have ever seen in film, in my opinion one of the best actor's in 1974.The script is well written and for the most part is easy to follow.If you seen the first film, which is a must to understand this film, then you will like the second one, which is one of the best films of",9,3,5,9 January 2007
American History X," One of the best movies of all time
","This may contain spoilers! I saw this film for the first time about 6 years ago when I was at the beach with my family. My cousin decided to rent the film, and told me that he watched it when he was in drug rehab. The movie is about a neo Nazi Derek Vinyard(Norton) who goes to jail for killing two African American men outside his house. He younger brother Danny Vinyard (Furlong) saw this, but did not testify, saving his brother from a life sentence. Derek gets out of jail 3 years later when his sentence is up, and finds out that his younger brother is on the same path of destruction. Derek tells Danny about changing his ways, and explains to what happened to him in jail in hopes that Danny does not go to jail either.This is a very powerful movie that is central theme is about anti-racism. The plot is a fairly generic one, someone telling someone close to them to change their ways so that they do not follow a similar fate.The acting is well done for all of the characters and you can see the emotion that Edward Norton has the end of the movie. The movie also has a unique way of tell the story. For any evens that have occurs in the past, black and white film is used, and when it's for the present color film is used. This film is NOT for everyone. If you are offended by racial slurs, acts of violence and hate against minorities, strong profanity (mainly the F word), rape, and or nudity, then do NOT watch this film. This film has all I have listed in the previous sentence in it, and then some. This is the one of the best films that I have ever seen, and I don't think any of the films that were made in the last 6 years even come close to the greatness this film has.So if you are not offended by any of the stuff I have listed above, then buy this film and watch it. It's one of th best films of the 90's.",9,0,0,22 December 2006
Pearl Harbor," Seen better
","Guess you could say I was unlucky to watch this horrible film when I was in Japan in the summer of 2002. I was on a navy base watching in the room with the people I was staying with.The only thing I was glad for was when I feel asleep and missed the second half of the film. The acting in general is bad. I mean Cuba Goodin Jr. does fine in this movie, it's just well, every one else kinda seemed, well pointless. The lines were really cheesy, and I've heard better lines come from bad b movies.Second the historical accuracy of this film, was really bad as well. It was sicken to watch this film, and the pain ended when I fell asleep.All in all, there are FAR better WWII movies out there to watch, so just ignore this piece of trash.",3,0,1,18 December 2006
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A decent, but flawed sequel
","A decent follow up to the first Jurassic Park film, but it could have been better. Basically the film takes place a few years after the accident at the island. Ian is now considered crazy by his peers for comments about the island. While visiting the creator of the island he learns that there was another island and a friend of Ian's is on the island.There are some things that I did like about the film. The CGI effects are still great, and there is some character development this time around, which is a nice change so it shows that characters are not always the same through the whole film.The script I felt was weak at times. Mainly the times with the Ingen corp group I felt there was some stock scripting and nothing felt like it could really happen. There are fewer kids in this film which is a plus since the kids int he first film and the kids in this film don't seem realistic. The kids act like movie kids, which doesn't make them as realistic as they could be.Overall it's not a bad sequel and it does follow the previous film well, but some flaws bog down the potential of a film that could have been a lot more.",6,10,16,5 May 2008
Million Dollar Baby," One of the best
","I bought this film movie one day on DVD at my old job, since I saw it on sale. When I watched this movie, I have to say I feel in love with it instantlyI'm a boxing fan, and I train with boxers and former boxers at the karate school I go to. Everyone who played in this film did a fantastic job of their parts. For anyone who has either trained in a boxing gym or seen people train in a gym, some of the actors and actresses portrait some of the people that you might see in a boxing gym.Danger, the person who tries to be a boxer, but has heart that's the size of Texas Shawrelle, a boxer, who is good, but is cocky, and has a heart the size of pea. Frankie, the old manager who does things the traditional way. Eddie, the former boxer, who now cleans the gym.While other boxing movies do exist, this is one of best boxing films that I have seen.",9,2,2,18 December 2006
Rocky," One of Stallone's better films
","May contain spoiler.I got to see the Rocky films for the first time a few weeks ago. At first I didn't know if I was going to like this film, since I'm not a Stallone fan, as a lot of films tend to be bad.However I liked Rocky. The story of a man given the shot of lifetime to be World Heavyweight Boxing Champion. At first Rocky is just a poor club fighter, making very little money, and also working for a collector as well. When the champ's opponent backs down from the fight due to injury, the champ chooses Rocky saying this will sound like something from a monster movie.All the actors and actresses do a good job, and the lines are solid, and not cheesy.Overall a good film that is must see for everyone, for those who cheer for the underdog.",8,1,2,18 December 2006
Titanic," I want my life back
","I watched this film in 1997 or 1998 I don't remember and after watching I wanted those hours of my life watching this film back.I mean, the had the right idea to make a film about the Titanic, but for god's sakes to make it film about two people who fall in love on the Titantic was just plain bad. The movie is not very accurate, and their are a lot of historical mistakes, which really bog down the movie. The only reason I can find for watching this film is to see Kate Winslet, who is very pretty.I was upset they made a love type story based around a disaster. If you want to watch this movie, due it with all due caution as you may find yourself hitting your head on wall after watching it.",3,2,4,21 December 2006
Rocky III," A good sequel
","This movie is the third installment in the Rocky Series. This movie takes place sometime after the second movie. Basically the film starts out by giving a recap of the previous movie, so in this case, it's recapping Rocky winning the world championship from Apollo. Now Rocky is a huge celebrity, and wants to retire from boxing, but an up and coming fighter wants to fight Rocky to prove to the world that Rocky is a push over.There are sad parts in this film, mainly when Mick passes away and when Rocky loses the title. The acting is this movie is top notch as always and the script is well written. The only script part that I have a problem with is Rocky's incoherent rant right after Mick dies.Overall this is a good film to watch and if you like the Rocky movies, then this is a must see.",7,2,2,9 March 2007
The Happening," Predictable Ending
","I saw this film yesterday and needless to say it wasn't the best film I've seen in a long time. Basically people starting killing them selves for no reason what so ever and nobody knows what is causing the problem.While the ideal is quite good, there are some problems with the film in general. The first problem is the cast. Several of the characters are miscasts and this is a problem. Zooey or as I call her the 'Thousand Yard stare lady' plays the wife of the main character. Her eyes seem out of focus the entire time and she just looks like she is looking out into space the entire time.The film wasn't very scary at all since when something bad was about to happen you could predict what was going to happen. The ending of the film was pointless and predictable as well.Overall this wasn't a great film, so avoid unless you have nothing better to do.",5,1,6,16 June 2008
The Godfather: Part III," Highly Underrated
","When you talk to a lot of people who saw this movie, they will tell you that this is a horrible movie. I beg to differ.Basically this movie jumps ahead to the late 1970's, as Michael is still in charge of the Corleone family. Michael is now trying to make the Corleone business dealings legit. At the same time he takes a young protégé under his wing, so that when he retires, someone else can take command of the family.The acting for the most part is pretty good. A lot of people will tell you that Sofia Coppola did a horrible job as Mary Corleone. I mean she wasn't that bad as the role in my opinion, but she probably would have been the better choice then Winona Ryder who is a bad actress.Don't listen to the bad hype that people give this movie. It's a good movie in it's own right, so do yourself a favor and watch the last movie in the Godfather Saga.",8,1,3,26 January 2007
Casino Royale," Easily the best James bond movie around
","Last night I had the pleasure of watching this film for the first time. I must say that I was curious for a long time on how this movie would turn out, being that a blond actor was playing James Bond. I can say that once the film started, that feeling went away, I and knew that Daniel Craig was the real deal.The script, the expressions, and the fight scenes were in a sense awesome in it's purest form. I'm pretty sure if you would look awesome up in a dictionary, you would find this movie in there. James Bond seems more bad ass which is a change from his usual self but it makes the character seem more human, as he is not always a suave type character.I do have one major issue with the movie, and that is the time setting that this movie takes place in. While this movie is to be able James Bond's first assignment as a 00 agent, I think setting the film in the present, really takes away from it. Considering that the first James Bond film was made in 1962 I felt that this film should have taken place in the late 50's early 60's instead of the present. It would like having the film Gettysburg set in the year 2000 instead of the 1800s.Other than the small problem that I have, I found this film to be a delight every minute of the way. If you have not seen it and are a James Bond fan, I STRONGLY recommend that you see this film, you will not be disappointed.",9,3,7,11 December 2007
The Truman Show," Easily one of the most unique ideas I have ever seen
","I love movies, good and bad, new and old. With the countless and awful remakes in today's world it's hard to find a movie that's original and unique today. I rarely watch new films since I think the older ones are better imo.I wouldn't consider myself a huge Jim Carrey fan, I like some of his movies, but not all of them. I had the honor of watching this great film several years ago in a college psychology class, and loved it. The basic idea of the film is that a man who believe what he is experiencing the real world, is in fact a staged TV show that has been going on for years and has no idea about it.The film itself is unique because to my knowledge nothing like this has been done before until EdTV, but that was different. The movie itself brings up an interesting point. Is everything that we do in life just part of some gran scheme and somebody is watching out lives. This film also has a quote that I would like to point out 'We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.' This quote itself imo sums up the entire film. We don't question the reality that exists as we see it. We accept it, but how do we know it's real. How do we know it's not some person's dream and that once they wake up we die? We don't know that, nobody knows. We just accept it and deal with it. Truman doesn't question at first the world he is in. Little by little he questions the system and overall learns about his 'wolrd' that he lives in.If you have not seen this film then I would strong suggest you watch it, especially those who have psychology background.",9,2,4,6 December 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," An American Classic
","I was born long after this film came out, so I never got to see it in the theaters.This is one of those movies, that everyone has to see before they die. While the special effects by todays standards are very dated, they are still fun to watch. Basically the story is about a war between the Galatic Empire and the Rebel forces, who are trying to over throw the Empire.The acting is well done, and the script is done very well also. While yes this film has a lot of mistakes, they are easily overlooked as the film goes on.I would advised not seeing the 1997 remake, as I feel that wasn't a good choice for George Lucas to do by adding certain things in and thus sorta ruining the movie all together. The 2005 (or 2004 I don't quite remember) release was a small improvement, I would suggest finding a copy of the original which was released on DVD last year and watching that.Overall, this is a great movie to watch, and you have not lived life, until you have watched the original Star Wars Trilogy.",9,0,0,28 January 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Basically a long TV episode
","I've always enjoyed the Simpsons back in the 90's and early 2000's. I'm still a fan but I haven't watched any new episodes for a few years now. I was happy to hear that a film was coming out and I heard mixed review but I still had to see it for myself.I won't throw away the film but due to an accident a dome is forced to cover Springfield and the Simpsons attempted to deal with the issue at hand with the dome.This wasn't the funniest film out there in terms of comedy. It was funny at times, but not rolling on the floor laughing funny. The script is well written, but the jokes at times are corny and stupid.The film itself was a great idea and enjoyable to watch. If your a former fan or a current fan of The Simpsons then watch the movie, you will enjoy it.",7,1,3,14 May 2008
The Godfather," All you could every want in a movie
","For the first time in my life, I was blessed able to watch this masterpiece. The film has aged well since it was released and I was very impressed.This film is about the Corleone crime family and their struggles with the other crime families.This is Marlon Brando's best film in my opinion, and every actor and actress does a fabulous job.The film is rather long, so make sure you have plenty of time on your hands to watch it. It took me a few days to watch it, but I was recovering from surgery, so I could only watch a little bit at a time.",9,1,3,22 December 2006
