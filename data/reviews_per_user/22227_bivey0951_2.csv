War Dogs," Wait for HBO for this one
","This is a tepid, funny at times, thriller about two criminals that attempt to defraud the US during war time. We get incredibly overweight Johah Hill back on the big screen playing a character of almost multiple personalities that has zero moral integrity. Miles Teller, who is trying to remain relevant in Hollywood, plays what seems to be a lesser evil person (and the somewhat moral compass of this story) but his character also agrees to defraud the US government. Hollywood seems taken with making movies about massive scum buckets (see Wolf of Wall Street, The Big Short, etc.) These two guys are certainly near the top of that list. Regardless of these characters lack of morals, the story is moderately interesting and has a few exciting scenes. If you stumble across it on HBO in the future and there is nothing else to see, it is worth a watch.",6,3,6,22 August 2016
Zodiac," A really dull film...but if you need to kill 3 hours, then this film is for you.
","'Zodiac' starts out with the potential to be an exciting movie. After the first 15 minutes, you are left with nothing but the minutia of a curious newspaper cartoonist with the hobby of figuring out who may be the serial killer. Unfortunately, the film WALLLOWS in this minutia because it drags on for another 2 1/2 hours after anything that resembles excitement/suspense happens. Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal are respectable in their extremely tedious and boring roles but Robert Downey Jr. makes both of them seem amateurish by comparison. If the film were edited down by an hour and a half, it would be worth renting. Otherwise, it seems like a dull 'America's Most Wanted' re-enactment.",4,18,37,5 March 2007
