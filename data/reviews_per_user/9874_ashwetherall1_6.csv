First Man," Not Boring . Just an insightful character study that stuck mostly to the facts.
","Firstly when making a biopic about an individual the film maker has to ask themselves am I going to make the bio historically accurate to capture the fact and the individual/ characters or are you going to give your audience a flavor or the facts and main characters with out being historic. I say this because a recent film by the name of Bohemian Rhapsody came under fire for being historically inaccurate and now The First Man has been called boring by some on this site for being very accurate.The First man isn't and action movie, nor is it a Team up against it film. No its an in depth study of a man who did an extraordinary thing. Neil Armstrong is possibly's histories biggest enigma. The first man to walk on the Moon but is the last man ever to seek publicity from that experience.
From what I've read over the years Neil Armstrong was an Ice man, a man who would never fold under pressure. He was also a family man who did his job without drawing attention to himself.
What the film tries to do is find out what made Armstrong tick. This is achieved with the near perfect casting of (less is more) Ryan Gosling, who hardly needs to say a word to emote what Armstrong is feeling .
Then there's Claire Foy as Armstrong's wife Janet. She is the audiences window into Neil's personal life. She also challenges his cold exterior and shows us his vulnerabilities . The scene where she pushes him into talking to his sons about the Moon mission is more powerful than a Saturn 5 rocket and yet she hardly needs to raise her voice.
The supporting cast is also excellent I especially liked Cory Stoll as Buzz Aldrin, The only man to say say out loud what everyone's thinking.Also it must be said that this film is not boring, in-fact I found some scenes terrifying simply because they used the effects so well.. The effects put you in Armstrong's cockpit and not a Star Wars inspired tracking shot..
The First Man gives the watcher a realistic picture of what it probably like to be an astronaut. and for that is commendable. I don't think it was ever designed to be a blockbuster. It just got marketed that way.",8,13,25,25 November 2018
The Hunger Games," A slightly flawed but very enjoyable Adaptation
","Watched The Hunger games last night. It was a pretty good Movie adaptation of a very difficult book to put on film for a mass audience. The Acting and the look if the film was excellent especially Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson as Katniss and Peeta.The violence,although very much toned down via the slightly blurred shaky cam fight scenes it was realistic enough for the viewer to take it seriously and not in an Arnie Swartzy way. Also the arena Special effects were very well done, but never over done so please TAKE NOTE Micheal BAY and JAMES CAMERON. If i had one minor complaint,it would be that some of the much need humour regarding Haymitch, Effie and Cinna team of Helpers seems to have possibly left on the cutting room floor.Finally some people have complained that The Hunger Games is not as true to the books as it could have been. But I wish to remind these people that neither was HARRY POTTER,JAWS,THE WOMAN IN BLACK or even THE RUNNING MAN of which the novel in emotion bares more of a resemblance to the Hunger Games than Japans Battle Royal.All in all The Hunger Games wasn't perfect but I really enjoyed it and would recommend it.",8,1,12,25 March 2012
Alexander," Turd
","There are 3 versions of this movie out on sale. I have seen them all. There is an old saying that bauds well for Oliver Stones Alexander. YOU CAN'T POLISH A TURD. It made the 1950's version look good. Sorry but its the truth, and Mr stone is a truth seeker. The gave him a 100 million budget. The best actors around. What went wrong. Well the battles were boring. The acting was crap. The music was annoying. Colin Farrell looked like David van Day from 70's group Dollar which is never a good thing. Angelina Jolie was just to weird for word's i wasn't sure she was even acting. Speaking of acting the movie seems to think that ancient Macidonia was peopled by the Dubliners, except Angelina i had no idea where she came from. The only good actors were the elephants. I went to the cinema wanting so much for this movie to be good. Yes i herd the rumours before going. How was i to know that they were telling the truth.",1,15,22,19 September 2009
Bohemian Rhapsody," A celebration not an expose
","After listening to the reviews calling Bohemian Rhapsody a bog standard bio I think it's time for me to put my two cents in to the ring.Personally I must have been watching another movie. Or is that I just understood what the makers of Bohemian Rhapsody were trying to achieve.Actually let's start with just that.Bohemian Rhapsody is a tribute to the legacy of Freddie Mercury and also the band Queen. It was primarily made for the fans of the the band and to showcase the band and its history to a new audience.To do this the film primarily uses a straight forward story telling style. This also means that events and time lines have to be condensed and fictionalised to tell that story in just over 2 hours. This also means that many real characters have to amalgamate in to a couple of fictional personas. I personally had no problem with this. I also liked the fact that the film poked fun at future events using also comic casting. Those who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about.
It seems to me that the critics wanted something that real Queen Fans have no real time for, namely a movie that explores Freddie's wild private life. We know what he did. We know a lot about his wild side. But Queen Fans want a film about the most important elements of Freddie's life. Namely the band and its music.Bohemian Rhapsody does something better.Instead of showing a debauched indulgent life, Bohemian Rhapsody instead shows us a man trying to come to terms with his extraordinary life. It shows how with the help of the truly talented other members of Queen he was able to do that. It also shows his Joy, his loneliness, plus some of his mistakes and missteps along the way, and of course his complex relationship with Mary Astor possibly the one person he truly loved.It tackles his sexuality and some of the aftermath of his partying. It also shows the beginning of his illness. This is all achieved with sensitivity and respect.Now for the music.Bohemian Rhapsody is possibly at its greatest when recreating queen on stage. Using a mixture of real singing from the actors, Queen and Freddie's over dubbing and sound alike artists to create a totally unique feel to Queens songs. Recreations of the bands greatest hits are mixed, to sound fresher than ever. Some even help the movie to move along showing headlines and critic's reviews as the songs play out. Then there's The Live Aid performance. Much like the real concert it almost dwarfs everything that has gone before on film. We the audience really get to experience what it was like to be at that event. Not just from the crowd but from the bands point of view. Almost every highlight from that performance is featured.The performances.Everyone agrees Rami Malek is a revelation as Freddie after about 20 minutes you totally forget that this is an actor. He is Freddie. This can also be said for Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joseph Mazzello playing The rest of the band in fact in the case of Lee the transformation into Brian May is astounding. As the film primary focuses on Freddie you can feel a sorry that aspects of the other members of the band aren't fully explored. Rogers womanising is hinted at but Brian's private life and his relationship with his father are not. John Deacon remains the enigma of the band.
Lucy Boynton gives a carefully measured and sensitive performance as Mary Astor coming to terms with the changes in Freddie's life.
Unfortunately Allen Leech has the unenviable task of playing a composites of some of Freddie's lovers and can be seen as a bit of a cliche villain. But he gives a good account of himself.
As for the rest of the cast. Everyone else is solid.The film begins with Live Ad and ends on that same day.If you're a fan of Queen I defy you to leave your seat as the credits role..
To Sum up. Bohemian Rhapsody is a celebration, not an expose and it should be treated that way by those pay their money to see it..
The Critics obviously didn't get it.",10,190,300,1 November 2018
The Patriot," It makes me very ashamed
","God bless you Mel Gibson. Again you have made me so very ashamed of the land where I was born. When I saw Bravehart I felt so very sorry for the way that we nasty, viscous Brits treated those cultured piece loving Scots. And just a few years later I was privileged to see The Patriot. This movie reinforced the notion that being British or even worse English is to be considered lower than a Nazi a serial killer,or Gary Glitter. Of course I am kidding and Mr Gibson was a dam fool for even signing up to make this movie. The Patriot is historically inaccurate in almost every aspect ,accept maybe for the battle scenes. The characters are presented as good and evil.(the militia never took prisoners as shown in the movie, they could not afford too. the British always tried to take prisoners, mainly as hostages and to barter with. Remember Cornwallis was well aware that the British were outnumbered, )Their are no grey areas. Maybe some one should have told the writers that atrocities' took place on both sides and that most of the war crimes against the American army and the patriots were carried out by there fellow country men. But any one who watches this movie and believes that the British were complete Bastards should read there history books. Oh and P S. Mel Gibson character is a composite of a number of people. One of which was a slave owner and trader. If anyone reads this humble review who is associated with Mr Gibson tell him to please read some Proper history books before signing on to another UK hating historically inaccurate Hollywood mess.",2,4,9,18 May 2008
Midway," Pretty historically accurate . But that's about it.
","I've just seen Midway and I must say that in terms of historical accuracy its better than the 1976 film of the same name and a better film than 2001'sPearl harbour, But that's not really saying much.
Although mostly accurate in presenting what happened Midway has some major flaws . For me these are the CGI battle sequences, many of which come off as looking very fake and video gameish. giving the film a sifi feel than an historic edge This tended to detract from the life and death situation that the film aims to present. The other flaw is the dialogue which is pretty awful. That said the actors do there very best with the inane lines they have to say.Now that said. I did find myself enjoying Midway, because as I said It at least got many of its historic facts right and got almost everything covered in 2h 18 mins. I really liked the part where legendary Director John Ford is filming the Japanese attack on the island. I've seen the real footage and it was a nice addition to the story.Unfortunately Director Roland Emmerich should have used films like Tora Tora Tora, Patton and Saving private Ryan as a war movie blue prints than say Independence day and Star wars. This approach tended to make this viewer care less for the characters who die and the overall tension of situations presented.The acting is mostly solid with the always reliable Patrick Wilson,Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson adding some gravitas. Ed Skrein and Luke Evans as the two action leads fair less well. This isn't because they are bad, in fact I like both actors. It 's just that they have been saddled with the worst parts of the script saying those cod macho lines that seem to find there way into mediocre action films. We know that they would have been  them selves in those situations and wouldn't have time to say ' this is for pearl? They just wanted to get the job done and get the hell out of there. Watch any documentary and that's what your told.So to sum up. Midway isn't a bad film but with it could have been a truly great film in a different director at the helm. I would recommend this as a first stop to anyone who has a passing interest in the battle of Midway and then tell them to read some history books and watch some interviews with the brave men that fought for that little island.",6,2,3,1 February 2020
