Blade Runner 2049," Blade Shuffle, in very slow motion. Zzzzzzzz!
","I saw the Original Blade Runner, great movie. 
This however, was so slow that I prayed for it to end. I can't believe that even though a huge amount of effort and money was invested in this film that it moved at the speed of a snail going uphill. I was overjoyed when it was finally OVER!
Special effects were up to par. But the editing could have cut this film from over 2hrs to a faster and more interesting pace. 
A great story with great effects is often destroyed by bad timing. But when the timing is off it can make you pray for your own death. This is where EDITING is most important. This film, sadly did not benefit from good editing.",3,6,11,25 February 2018
A Star Is Born," A Snore Is Born
","My wife asked me what rating I would give this. I said, 'zero'. She asked why? I asked her 'would you like your time back on this one?' She said yes.I replied, 'I rest my case'. She said she'd give it at least 4 because she like the actors. I told her it was a pity vote.We saw the last version in 1976, starring Barbara Streisand and Chris Kristofferson. It was really not that good either but at least there was real believable chemistry between them and it flowed from beginning to end with at least 2 hit songs.
This current version died at the beginning and the corpse had to be dragged to the painful end.
No chemistry, no good acting and the only two good things were one song Gaga sang at the piano and the dog.",1,5,11,22 February 2019
Knives Out," It's a Crime how this put me to sleep.
","My wife just started some tomato seeds and watching them grow was more exciting than this snooze fest. It was a boring stream of dialogue that just droned on and on.
We could not even finish this. We cut our losses about half way through.
I enjoy a good mystery, But it has to keep you in suspense and it must MOVE ALONG. I like all of the actors and that is all I can say that's positive. The Characters, on the other hand, were not interesting, nor likable. If I were to try to finish this film I believe I would have lost the will to live.
This movie lacked suspense, timing, and interest. Now, I will stop here, I have to go watch those seedlings I mentioned earlier grow some more.",3,1,4,27 February 2020
"I, Tonya"," The story of a Perfect Storm of failure.
","A sad, sad tale of an Olympian's fall. A fall due to bad life choices, bad decisions, and snobbery. 
Harding was extremely talented and could have won an Olympic medal. But it was not to be. Some reasons were out of her control and some weren't. 
Allison Janney did a fantastic acting job as Tonya's horrible mother. 
If you see this film, put your judgements on hold. No matter what your opinion of Tanya Harding is, this story reveals circumstances you've probably not known. 
I gave this 4 stars only because the film itself was just not that great, even though the story itself was interesting. Am I glad I saw it? I could go either way on that. It's basically a case of personal taste. 
If you are a serious fan of skating, go see it. If not, it's a crap shoot.",4,1,1,16 March 2018
Dunkirk," Did not do the Real Story justice.
","The Story of Dunkirk was an EPIC event, a key event of WW2. This film, in my opinion just did not make it as far as getting the idea across that this was a miraculous. mammoth undertaking. This film has some good points but it floundered. You get the feeling there are only a handful of boats and planes involved. I just did not feel the SCOPE of this undertaking.",3,1,1,29 December 2017
The Favourite," Let's make a 'Frankenstein' Movie!
","You take a little History, very little Comedy, some Drama, some Irritating Soundtrack, and stitch it all together. What comes out is a hodgepodge of various elements that do not quite fit together, and the final product is a film that irritates, wastes the talents of good actors and lasts too long!",1,3,11,8 March 2019
The Shape of Water," A Fairy Tale for Adults who can suspend reality for a while.
","Great actors, set design, great direction. This should not be compared to other films. Some say this is 'Beauty and the Beast meets Splash and the Creature from the Black Lagoon'. 
It IS a basic Good guys vs. Bad guys tale. But it's not that simple, it is much more than that. If you want to Really enjoy this film, just suspend any prejudgement, suspend reality (of course certain things are unbelievable, it's fantasy!) and simply soak it in. 
One can 'read' a lot of different things into this film, on different levels. 
 
I don't want to spoil this so I suggest you view this film first then come back and read the rest of my review below (scroll down later. See if you agree..............For me the basic message (or lesson) this 'Fairy Tale' has is that genuine Love looks beyond appearance and sees the inner soul and that this love heals all.",8,47,89,23 March 2018
Mother!," A masterpiece that challenges the viewer!
","This film is for those who like literature over pulp. Most movies are simple action or comic entertainment. Nothing wrong there, no judgement from me, unless it's badly executed. 
 MOTHER is philosophical literature. It is for those who want to be challenged intellectually, morally and ethically. It is not a mindless horror flic. 
******Spoiler Alert*****
 What this film shows thru metaphors are the absurd, cruel and plain stupid flaws of mankind. The flaws of ego, idol worship, false religions, greed, hypocrisy etc. (it's a long list). A college course could be taught based on this film. 
 The house is the earth, the mother is Mother Nature in a constant struggle to overcome mankind's careless, violent, destructive, arrogant and greed driven onslaught. Mother also symbolizes all the men and women who want to do good. The husband is the corruption of Ego and the symbol of men in power abusing (often without even thinking) women and those weaker than them. He also symbolizes absurd manmade religions and cult figures who take advantage of fear, greed, ignorance, hate, etc. There are too many symbols to get into here. 
 In short, we are bitch slapped for our failure to appreciate our abundant environment, our horrific failure to embrace our ultimate power and only salvation, which is Unconditional Love (we just don't seem to learn). If we don't take care of Mother, Mother in all it's symbols will not take care of us. I challenge all who choose to see this film to think and make their own additional arguments and interpretations.",Null,0,2,2 January 2018
Jojo Rabbit," This film died with the Rabbit.
","I have a Rule! If a film shows cruelty to animals, even though I know it's make believe the film is OVER for ME! END OF STORY.
Minutes into this movie I stopped watching.
I'm sure the rest of the movie had a good message overall and was well made with good intention. But to even risk showing animal cruelty to possibly gullible and impressionable people (You Know they are out there) who would try to copy this cruelty is a non starter. End of Story!",1,1,43,23 February 2020
Moonrise Kingdom," Should have received at least 8 stars except one thing that spoiled it for me.
","Here is a quirky movie with good actors that SHOULD have been fun. Lots of fun and it made me smile until one particular scene that just RUINED it for me. It was totally unnecessary! It was like dining in a 4 star restaurant and finding a cockroach
in a 200 dollar meal. I stopped watching and never saw the rest of the film.
The 'Cockroach' in this instance is a scene that shows a dog shot in the neck with an arrow. TOTALLY NOT NECESSARY to the story and irresponsible to boot. Shame on the writer, director and producers.",2,2,11,5 June 2018
Click," I swore I would not see anymore Sandler movies, Glad I saw this one.
","This came out in 2006 and somehow I missed even hearing about it, until I happened upon a preview of it. 
After several Adam Sandler movies, I swore I would never bother with any more.
I saw the previews for Click and figured if it had Christopher Walken in it that it might just be worth watching. It was a very pleasant surprise.
It was just quirky and funny enough to be enjoyable. Granted, some of the jokes were a bit forced and corny, but overall it held my attention and entertained me. 
There is one scene near the end where Sandler gave a great heartfelt performance. 
Click is not a dark comedy or goofy, instead it is a comedy with a touching message that everyone can appreciate. 
Would it win an Oscar? No. But it is certainly worth watching!",9,0,1,28 July 2018
