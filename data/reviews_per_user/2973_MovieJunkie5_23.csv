Ford v Ferrari," More than a car movie
",This movie is so energy-filled action-packed emotionally-thrilled that engages you and begs for your attention in every single scene. Christian Bale gives yet another brilliant performance and so does Matt Damon and the entire cast. A movie not only for car enthusiasts but for everyone to enjoy.,8,14,16,16 January 2020
Captain Phillips," Captain Phillips
","Captain Phillips was intense from beginning to end. It was heartbreaking, fast-paced and action-packed in a different kind of way from action movies. It really engages you to pay attention and not shift your eyes elsewhere. A fantastic story and a brilliant performance by Hanks, as usual but the biggest surprise went to Barkhad. He was the cataliser of fear and horror in the entire movie but also the reason within his own group. Truly deserved all the nominations but pitty didn't win anything.",8,1,1,1 April 2020
Train to Busan," Train to Busan
","This movie was really intense. I was literally holding my breath as the zombies attacked and through all the sneaky plans to get by. One of the best apocalyptic dramas, very emotional and fast-paced. There's a clear evolution of character which I was happy to witness, from selfish to selfless and that makes you think about priorities in your life. Really recommend you go see it!",8,1,1,21 February 2020
Knives Out," An actually good movie of this genre
","I thought about going to the cinema to watch this movie... The plot was so interesting, the cast seemed good and couldn't stop feeling a bit of a clichÃ© pre-viewing. I have to admit that I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie! Always trying to guess who did what and trying to connect all the dots. It's a superb suspense and intriguing movie but I also laughed so many times, a lot more than I was expecting. The cast was amazing but congratulations to Daniel Craig, really enjoyed his character. The thing is, you can watch the movie several times and even though you already know who commited the crime, if you pay close attention you will always discover and connect something new and sooner than before. Really entertaining and overall very good movie",8,14,36,29 November 2019
The Irishman," I Heard You Made Masterpieces
","Seeing Al Pacino, De Niro, Pesci and Keitel directed by Scorcese is truly a joyful adventure and a wild one too. It feels like a 70's modern movie with all the intensity and necessary pace for telling the story. With at least 3 timelines, I did not feel it was too long and the time just flew by. It really seems a huge homage to all this big actors and all their movie contributions. It feels sad for possibly the last time we could see them and to see this decade-long friendships... It's truly nostalgic. I'm sorry I've rambled on about anything except the movie! The actors were amazing, Pacino and De Niro still got it and we could feel they were at home, at ease in their own comfort. The plot was very well designed, a tiny bit predictable but hey, with 3h30min you get to think a lot of what's going to happen right? A fantastic movie, one of the best of its genre and truly a masterpiece for the ages! We are the lucky ones to be able to witness something so fantastic from this legends.",7,3,6,14 December 2019
Milk," Milk
","Milk is a biography of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay official in California. I have to say I did not know about him or everything he did for the gay movement but it's really inspiring and moralizing seeing someone with courage to stand and do something about it. There are plotholes and things that don't add up, in my perspective, but they all seem to fall to second place when in comparison to the story and to Milk's journey. It's a movie that should be seen by everyone and specially to enlighten a few. The cast delivers all around good performances, specially Josh Brolin as Dan White and Sean Peen as Milk. Truly recommend you see it!",7,0,0,16 April 2020
Snatch," A big mess
","This movie is one of the biggest messes shown on screen. It's confusing, filled with turns and twists which portrays life and this particular plot so well. The movie is hilarious in a serious and dark way. One of my favorite movies by Ritchie and one of my favorite roles for both Statham and honestly Brad Pitt. The latter plays such a different character, he's my favorite in the movie. Talk about a luxurious cast with Statham, Pitt, Del Toro, Vinnie, Alan Ford and much more. Great cast and fantastic acting / directing, really recommend you see it!",9,1,2,18 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Waiting for other SW movies in a few years
","Although the movie will always be enjoyable, since the entry to the beautiful score and all the classic characters, this was not a good movie. Filled with cheesy lines and with a lot of plot holes, the storytelling was poor. Having said that, I really think the actors did their best with whats been given to them. This types of movies, good or bad, always make a gazillion dollars so they'll probable pick up again in a few years. I hope they can expand the SW universe and bring to the screen something different... something to level of the first installment of the saga.",6,2,10,4 January 2020
American Hustle," David O. Russel does it again
","After Silver Lining Playbook, David O. Russell does yet another fantastic movie. Brilliant performances by all actors, beautiful cinematography, great dialogue and plot and the sound and music spot on. I think it deserved more than 10 Oscar nominations, a win here or there to boost it's acknowledgement. Overall, a very good movie!",8,2,4,18 September 2019
Watchmen," Watchmen
","Watchmen is a different kind of superhero movie where it appears to exist a superhero killer. It has a bit of everything and although that may seem good, it isn't. It's a mess at times, could've been shorter but it does keep you interested it what's going on. My favorite character has to be Rorschach, just for the name and being a psychological ambiguous test, it really draws some connections to the character. Not my favorite movie but it's worth seeing!",7,1,2,22 April 2020
The Bourne Identity," The Bourne Identity
","The Bourne Identity is an action thriller movie starring Franka Potente, Julia Stiles, Chris Cooper and Matt Damon in the leading role playing a government personal suffering from amnesia from a previous attack. It plays out very smoothly from the action scenes, very realistic and pretty cool to watch from the romantic scenes, not overly dramatic nor romanticized. It demands your full attention even though the plot is not complex and easy to follow. Really a good action movie, recommend you see it!",7,0,0,19 April 2020
Toy Story 4," Not quite there but still really good
",We all know the Toy Story franchise and it's difficult to top the previous movies. Very nicely introducing a 'new' character and plot and it made the film interesting and enternaining. The detail on the characters is also amazing!,8,0,1,19 July 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," One of the best, ever
","I've heard wonders about the movie, about O'Toole and David Lean and i must say nearly-4h of movie didn't stop me from enjoying what must be considered a masterpiece. The plot is fantastically demonstrated and designed, the screenplay is interesting even if you couldn't care less about politics or history, the actors, all of them, give brilliant performances, the sound and music are so powerful they can transport you exactly to that scene in particular.Truly a masterpiece for the ages and a movie to be seen again and again.",9,1,2,20 September 2019
The Lion King," Not that bad
","Maybe I saw it with lower expectations due to the bad reviews but i honestly enjoyed it. If it's the same plot as the previous movie, and i loved the previous movie, with better animation and effects, what's not to like? It's good!",7,0,4,19 July 2019
1917," Intense and emotional
","The one shot trick really worked for me, I couldn't take my eyes of the characters and my attention and emotions were always with them, even though I did not know any of them very well. It's one of the most beautiful movies shot this year, the cinematography is breathtaking, the suspense is high and the tension heavy. It's dramatical and so engaging with the viewers. Should win pratically everything in the technical categories and even perhaps best movie of the year.",9,14,22,24 January 2020
Donnie Brasco," Forget about it
","Donnie Brasco is a good different-kind of mafia movie. Doesn't rely on violence of violent scenes but on character development, relationship and interactions so you can understand the gruesome and horror in the mafia without having to see it. Depp plays one of his best roles in his career and Pacino is more of the same, born to play roles like this. It's dramatical, dark but that one scene where Depp's character explains the whole 'Forget about it' meaning had me laughing. Great movie!",8,1,1,17 March 2020
Midsommar," Midsommar
","I've previously seen Hereditary and it was one of the best movies in 2018 so seeing this movie from Ari Aster, my expectations were high. Although I have to say it is not on the same level, it is still a pretty good psychological horror. The cinematography is so gorgeous which makes it all so much more contrasting and horrific. The sound is always spot on but Florence Pugh was the true heart of this movie. She has such a wide range of emotions, is subtle when has to be subtle but makes a big perfect scene when she has too. Demonstrating all her skills, she'll go far in the industry! Still think she should've been nominated for this role instead of Little Women but I guess the important thing is that she's nominated. The screenplay is fantastic, setting up the movie in a suspenseful way. It didn't feel slow-paced to me, more like medium-paced, if that's a thing, since it always had something to grab my attention, Truly recommend it you go see it and like 'he' says, try to keep an open mind about it!",7,10,15,3 February 2020
La La Land," One of the Best Cinema Experiences
","After Whiplash, which is a masterpiece of its own, comes another one of Damien Chazelle both mesmerizing and hypnotic.That movie can make you laugh, cry, feel sorry for them but happy and the same time. It's something in a whole new level achieved by not so many movies. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are simply wonderful, funny, with passion about their dreams, never giving up.It gives us a beautiful story of never letting your dreams go, always chase them and you'll see they'll come true, even at the expense of big sacrifices.Even better was to have the opportunity to choose the end, either the real one or the 'fake' one, that makes us happier.It will surely be around for the next years as a unique and wonderful movie, destined to be a huge classic seen by grandchildren everywhere.Definitely recommend!",8,2,8,29 January 2017
Reservoir Dogs," Reservoir Dogs
","This is one of my favorite Tarantino movies. It's short, action-packed, emotionally thrilling and dramatical. It has a fantastic cast, brilliant performances, the screenplay is brilliant and is what makes this plot so believable and entertaining. It keeps getting better with time and I can't get over all the songs played in the movie. They are just stuck in my head long after I've watched the movie. Superb work by everyone but specially to Mr. Tarantino.",9,0,0,30 March 2020
Die Hard," Die Hard
","Die Hard is such an intense movie that I find myself constantly in tension wondering what crazy stunt Bruce Willis' character is going to pull off. Filled with action, suspense and surprinsingly funny one-liners, this is a movie to watch time and time again. Alan Rickman does a stupendous villain with a magnetic and powerful character and ARgyle must be the most clueless person in the world to not be aware of anything untill the very last stage of the robbery. The cast overall was fantastic, the movie is great, truly recommend you go see it if you haven't already!",9,1,1,10 April 2020
Parasite," Roller coaster of emotions
","Bong's movie is truly a masterpiece for the ages. I was honestly surprised to see such a turn in plot, feelings and actions. My heart was a roller coaster of emotions, laughing and being comfortably sitted and later on the edge of my seat, not laughing now but still rooting for them. The soundtrack was gorgeous, the editing superb, the acting was so genuine and looked effortless. This movie really spiked my interest not only in more of Bong's movies but in korean movies in general!",10,22,35,8 November 2019
Marriage Story," Simple and Powerful
","This is the kind of movie that I really admire. A simple plot turned into a complex and difficult story just because of the amazing cast and acting they demonstrated. I can't say I'm surprised by Adam Driver, I've been an admirer of his for a very long time and his more recent movies have proven his depth and acting skills are really beyong the Star Wars-type of acting. The rest of the cast was fantastic, just want to also congratulate Noah for yet another powerful touching movie. I hope it goes big awards-wise.",9,5,6,20 December 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," War movie like non other
","Went to the cinema to see this movie (while other went to see Arrival) and I was soon emerged in the entire cinematographic plot with a good emotional story, good unforgettable characters and a war scenery rarely seen before. Such detailed images of pain, suffering, death but also life, effort and all about helping the other. One thing i didn't like (or liked less) was Vince Vaughn, i just don't think he has what it takes to play the general part. Just can't take him serious!Andrew Garfield on the other hand surprised me completely, wasn't expecting such a performance from him.The real verdict of Desmond Doss creates such a powerful message for all the viewers, it just doesn't go by unnoticed. I recommend everyone to see this movie!",8,3,8,1 December 2016
