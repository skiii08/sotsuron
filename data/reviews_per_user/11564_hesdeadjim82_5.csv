National Treasure: Book of Secrets," The good news and the bad...
","Always starting with the bad news... It is well within the shadow of its predecessor, and it doesn't have the thrill and magic the first movie displayed. Ben Gates's father seems to be played like a bumbling old man, which is confusing when he was previously played as a strong, proud character in the first movie. And what was it with the British accents, why were they sounding like they were just off the set of Oliver Twist! Very few of us Brits talk like that.The good news is... A sufficient amount of interesting conspiracy theories, puzzles and treasure make the mouth water, but it does get a little dry during the over played car chasing and action scenes. A nice amount of humour stops your mind from straying and the hints of a third movie really makes you want to know more.On a separate note, doesn't Nick Cage look old?...",6,0,2,9 February 2008
Juno," Better than I#d EXPECTED
","This is a really sensitive topic for a movie to undergo, and they do it with style. What was interesting was the way Juno was portrayed, she has some great comedy moments, quick whit and good morals. A misunderstood girl beyond her years, however, there are moments when her true age shows in her naivety. Especially when she lets herself get to close to people in situations beyond her understanding. This whole movie is like a rite of passage for Juno and she never losses sight of who she is. Michael Cera, I do enjoy watching. He rocked in Superbad, but he plays the same character (only less funny) in Juno. He is in danger of type casting himself. Although, despite this he was enjoyable to watch and added to the class of this movie.",9,1,7,18 February 2008
Cloverfield," A new genre is born
","When the film ended in the cinema, the audience was silent. Amongst the silence all I good hear were 'that was brilliant' or 'wow' comments. I have to agree with them!! It shows that a movie doesn't have to have a detailed story line or background explaining origins, to entertain you. It was a movie made purely for the viewers experience, you are on the journey with them and know all they know as they try to understand the situation. The camera work makes you feel a little dodgy at first, but you get use to it. I must say that the editing to make a big budget monster movie look amateurish was inspired. This monster really puts Godzilla to shame! The look of it is very different to my preconceptions to what it was like. I am disappointed at people who expected more from this movie (in terms of the story). Nothing else was needed, you are meant to use your imagination and fill in the gaps. That is what makes this movie great because it was different.",10,1,3,2 February 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Fancy a mince meat pie?
","This movie certainly doesn't smell as bad as Mrs Lovett's chimney! Unusual lyrics, gloomy sets and Helena Bonham Carter, is all you need for another triumph from Tim Burton. The movie wastes no time in jumping straight into the dark and depressing story of Sweeny Todd. Depp and Carter play their roles with a passion that allows the viewer to actually care about murderous baker and barber. The chemistry between them shines through the gloomy story line with room for some sadistic little chuckles on the way. They are obviously not the greatest of singers, but do a descent job of it, and are helped by other (well cast) characters with exceptional vocals. It ends rather abruptly, which leaves you hanging for a moment while you realise the credits are rolling and leaves you rather put of from meat pies for at least a couple of months!",8,0,2,26 January 2008
Wedding Crashers," Enjoyed every minute of it
","When I first watched this movie in the cinema when it was released I loved it then and saw it twice. I unfortunately forgot about it until I saw it again on TV tonight. How could I have forgotten? It is truly one of the best big box office movies that is actually funny. Clever humour, good morals (eventually), and plenty cheesy one liners that makes it a one of a kind amongst the many hundreds of slapstick US movies. I love how the movie demonstrates to us that the crazy gene does not discriminate between class and bank accounts, and we should all except our families with a sense of humour. I think any woman wouldn't mind if either of them crashed their wedding.",9,6,7,27 January 2008
