Requiem for a Dream," Brilliantly awful
","I don't really know how to explain this film, so maybe it will come to me in this review.The film is shown from the perspective of 4 drug users as they spiral into a mental dystopia. All seeking a better life, aided by drugs, they fall into a state of insanity, demonstrated by a great use of film techniques.Despite the sophisticated film work, I found watching 'Requiem for a Dream' about as pleasurable as having a pigeon with diarrhoea land on my face. The story... goes nowhere. I spent a good 97 minutes wondering when something was going to happen. There was quite a few 'look at the clock' moments. And as the film progressed I found myself feeling increasingly uncomfortable. The finale was so painful, I was dying for the film to finish, as i was bombarded with obnoxious noise, and a montage of obscene nasty outcomes for each character. I could sense the other people in the room feeling the same, but perhaps slightly less tolerant than me. I was really hoping they didn't think I was enjoying myself.There was a large portion of the film spent of character development, and were supposed to appeal to different members of the audience as an attempt to cause a bigger impact as you watch their lives deteriorate, however, the characters were so dis-likable i didn't want to even look at them.The whole thing was basically an hour and a half of saying 'Drugs are bad', which i think they made quite clear. The film may have been more effective if it had been condensed into about 10 minutes and placed between a plot.You can tell that it's supposed leave you in a state of amazement, feeling disturbed and changed by the images you have just witnessed, which in many cases probably worked, explaining the amount of credibility it received. However, I have imagined things 10 times more horrible, and I can't think of a reason why i would want to share them with the general public.In summary: Very well executed, but i do believe in the saying 'You can't polish a turd'The only thing i got out of it was the ability to read clocks in the dark.",3,5,9,4 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," This is entertainment
","This was a mildly amusing attempt at a Prates of the Caribbean sequel.The first film was a quite respectable film, however, i think a lot of that was due to it's unique nature.Some of the unusually spontaneous techniques used in the first movie, were to heavily worked on in this film, and it's excessive scripting eliminated the element of originality, and natural flow of scenes. Especially Johnny Depp's acting, which was relatively improvised in the first film. The dialogue and script of Dead man's chest includes a lot of Depp's mannerisms primarily improvised in The curse of the black pearl.It was also a slightly uncreative, and half arsed attempt at banging out another action flick. Some of the movie quality was lost as the franchise turned into an absolute Hollywood blockbuster.Despite this, i think it actually was more exciting than the first. It was quite entertaining, as it was jam packed full of entertaining scenes. I especially interested by Davy Jones and the flying Dutchman, which saw a fun look at sea mythology.Although it was the most over the top thing ever, if you accept it for what it is, it's quite entertaining. It's obviously make believe, and not intended to be taken completely serious.So, i recommend this film, but don't expect a spectacular piece of film work, just enjoy t.",5,1,2,8 June 2007
Oldboy," This really is amazing
","This film is only for true film enthusiasts.If you are looking for a nice easy to watch film, then don't go for this. But if you like to appreciate the pure greatness of film, then i can tell you, this is not one to disappoint.To me films are the greatest invention ever, and this hits every marker a film needs. It's pure genius. Everything is pristine, and perfect.The story is a bit unrealistic, but it is so visually stunning that it becomes so believable.Oldboy is great, however, that's my opinion, films to me are more of a culture thing, i can enjoy, and appreciate every aspect of a film in depth. If you do not look at films in this way, you will probably feel differently about this film.",9,7,71,3 October 2006
Cloverfield," Excellent!
","Cloverfield is a brilliant film. I was expecting it to be reasonably good, but it really was excellent.The only thing that forced me to lower the rating, was the fact that it almost killed me. For about half of the film, I had to look at the ground, walls or close my eyes, due to the extreme and prolonged motion of the hand-held camera. If I didn't do so, i probably would have been carried out. This seemed to have no effect on a lot of people, but I recommend watching it with some water or nourishment in the anticipation that you'll be sick. Despite making me severely ill, I wouldn't say the hand-held camera was a bad part of the film. If the experience of a film is ruined by something such as this, then it would be bad, but in most cases it wasn't a problem.Watching this was incredible. It was really like watching an actual camera tape. Even little things like camcorder focusing and features were incorporated. So much thought has been put into this film, it's really great.There's even a little secret bit at the end that you'll probably miss if you blink, but it's really amazing.",4,0,2,8 February 2008
Being John Malkovich," what a puppeteer
","that was a good old film. if you have never seen this, i highly recommend watching it! every detail of the film is so thought out, this is an absolute masterpiece.if you like eternal sunshine of a spotless mind, you will like this, its of a similar style, probably because its the same writer.it starts like, 'what?', there are puppets!! then, it come together, then, its like 'what?!?!?!?!'. but then comes together again, but still the most weirdest film in the world, the idea is laughable, ha ha.its the most random thing in the world, which when made so visual, and unexpected, makes me laugh. it may not make you laugh, but it made me laugh. there are also other funny elements, such as dialogue and some humorous events, that are actually supposed to funnier than the idea itself, which wasn't supposed to be hilarious, but thats my kind of thing.good work to everyone who took part in making this.",8,1,2,13 July 2005
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Not bad
","This film was alright.I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, but it's probably the best of the 5 out so far.There was some pretty good cinematography involved in this. Quite impressive on occasions. I especially liked it where the camera backs up through a pain of glass, and pans down to scene. (look out for that)The whole thing was acted well. Daniel Radcliffe is very convincing. Harry Potter seems much less geeky than he did in the first film.The visuals are quite nice. There are some very good special effects throughout the film, including make up, and CGI.The actual story wasn't excellent, it was a bit boring and uneventful. So I imagine the book isn't too great. There were some quite funny moments along the way, but nothing particularly interesting.Overall, the film was not brilliant. I went to see this with my Girl friend, something i'd suggest. It's quite a nice film to watch together, especially in the cinema. There's a part where Harry kisses a girl, as the camera pans up to the mistletoe above their heads. At this point the entire audience is under the mistletoe. A little crowd pleaser thrown in there.I would recommend this film, however, you'd probably be quite board on your own. The experience contributed a lot to it.",4,0,1,25 July 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," Possibly the best piece of film work ever created
","This is actually amazing. I have never seen a piece of film work quite like this. It is revolutionary, and i think that this film alone makes Stanley Kubrick the best director ever, despite all his other great work.However, this film is not for everyone. Some people may be bored by it, as there is very little dialogue, and a lot of it is quite subtle, and slow moving. Be warned, you have to be in the mood, as it's not overly easy to watch and requires your full attention. Not one to sit round with your mates after a few drinks. Any film maker or appreciator will enjoy this, as the whole feature is visually mesmerising, and accompanied by an incredible soundtrack.It portrays the development of life, and the history of existence. Billions of years of evolution are symbolised in one transition (you'll see that in the film).Basically, it is very good. At the end, a baby appears on screen, which you may not have my humour, but i was incredibly close to laughing my head off. However, i was restrained by the cinematic greatness, and felt no urge to laugh.I recommend the film, however, as i have said, don't watch this expecting a nice and easy entertaining movie. Make sure the room is silent and pitch black.",10,1,3,8 June 2007
Fantastic Four," Not very good
","I have always been a big fan of marvel. I used to enjoy watching the fantastic four cartoon in the 90's, despite thinking they're probably the most gay marvel characters. I suppose it was Doom who done it for me, being one of the coolest villains of all time.However, I can't say I felt the same way about the film, as it was about as exciting as an old man walking a tortoise.The majority of the film spent building up to a 10 minute climax. The fantastic our spend the whole time establishing their powers, until they finally use them in an unspectacular ending. The same amount of time is spent building up doom, who when eventually identified, turns out to share none of the charisma of the original comic book Doom. What I found even more disappointing was the American accent he spoke with (despite being Latvian).Johnny was the least likable person ever, and I hated reed Richards. All I wanted to see was doom kill them, but when he was revealed I didn't want either of them to win!Every disaster prevented by the four, was also created by them, cancelling out their heroism. It was a it like breaking a chair and then fixing it.In terms of production, the film wasn't too good either. Everything looked very artificial, as if the entire film was encased in plastic. It had a huge over use of CGI, and visually seemed quite bland.I would have rated it lower had it not been for it's marvel comic book character content. If you're not a fan of the comic book genre, you'll hate it, and if you are a fan, you'll hate how they ruined this film (epecially doom).poo.",4,0,2,2 May 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Better than expected!
","As the quality of the later episodes has slightly decreased, i was in some way expecting a moderately good film, with a few outstanding moments.What was i thinking?How can this film not be a masterpiece? This film was absolutely excellent. There is a joke at every single moment of the movie. The film goes right back to the way the simpsons were at their peek.There are a few cheesy parts, where i thought 'this is a bit gay', however, as soon as anything like this happens, the film cuts it out. E.g. Green Day. I was also glad that they didn't keep breaking into song.The Simpsons have also been severely enhanced cinematically. The appearance of the animation is far greater than the show.I laughed at it. I loved it. I highly recommend watching this film.",7,3,9,26 July 2007
V for Vendetta," Good.
","This is not what i was expecting at all.To be honest, i didn't think it looked that great. I thought it would have a lot of fast, easy to watch action, and be quite enjoyable while it lasted, and then i would probably forget about it.But this film is not one to be forgotten. I can really appreciate this film.It has a certain look about it, that just suggests perfection. I loved watching it, even when nothing was happening, every part of it looks so good.There are few films that people have said are good, and i've watched them, and not really seen much stand out. But while watching this film, numerous times I thought to myself, 'yeah, that is well good'.This is one of the best pieces of film work i've ever seen, I have a lot of respect towards everyone who made it what it is.",8,2,5,3 October 2006
