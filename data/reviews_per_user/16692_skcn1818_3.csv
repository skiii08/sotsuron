Vertigo," Memai
","I think this film is good. First reason is that many things in it are connected with the keywords of this film, 'vertigo'. For example, images and back music in its opening. Images express a spiral and back music seems to continue eternally so we can feel vertigo like the main character feels in this movie. There are some vertigo shots too. The audience usually knows the character's feelings from what he says and how he is but in this film, we can know it by how camera is moved.Another reason is the structure of its story. In the first half of it, the main person is Madeleine. In the second half of it, the main person is Scottie who is fascinated by Madeleine. The part I was surprised at is that the fact of murder is revealed early in the second half. Generally, the key points in films are revealed in the last scene but Hitchcock didn't do so. Because of it, audience can watch both sides, Scottie who loves Madeleine enthusiastically and Judy who can't forget love for Scottie while we have known that Judy is Madeleine. We can also watch this film while we expect the last scene too.",7,0,2,7 August 2014
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver
","I think this film is good because of two reasons.First, both the first scene and the last scene are the same. In the beginning, main character drives a taxi and he disappears into the darkness. In the last scene, he does the same thing. I think that ordinary films are not like this because through stories, main characters change and they become better, happy ending. In this film, main character does not change. His loneliness may increase through the story.In addition to it, I think the expression of loneliness is good in this film. For example, Travis sees the vulgar town in his taxi, he writes a diary and talks to the mirror. Back music makes these scenes lonelier too. The most impressive scene is that he breaks the TV. I think the reason is that he cannot accept ordinary happiness because he is so a lonely man. He cannot sleep without drags and he doesn't have any people he can rely on. However he tries to make a girlfriend, he fails to it and becomes lonelier. And so finally he plans to assassinate the next president. I think loneliness makes people madness.",7,0,0,7 August 2014
The Birds," Tori
","I think this film is good because it contains many ideas which make audience attract unconsciously. First, I think lovebirds are the symbols of weakness. In this film, both weakness and strength are compared in many scenes. Melanie looks like a tough woman. Her outlook is strong â€• her posture, she wears shoes with very high heels and her nail color is vivid red. When Mitch's sister is attacked by birds, Melanie helps her. But when Melanie is attacked, she could not avoid birds' attack by herself so she is helped by Mitch. In the last scene, although Melanie and Mitch's mother are not good at each other, when Melanie is injured, she is even helped by Mitch's mother. And also Mitch's sister helps lovebirds at the end of the film. It shows that people have to help a weak man and if they do not help him, he cannot live. For example, Mitch's ex-girlfriend is killed because she could be helped by no one.Second is that there are some relationships between this film and other Hitchcock's films. For example, relationship between mother and son appear in all films. And always mother loves her son strongly and she feels jealousy for other women. In the birds, Mitch's mother loves Mitch strongly and she does not like Melanie but in this film, there is Mitch's sister too. His mother says 'if Mitch disappears, I will be alone.' But it is not true. If he disappears, there will be her daughter, she won't be alone. It means she cannot love her daughter really, only love Mitch. The role of Mitch's sister is to accentuate of the strength of mother's love to her son.",8,0,1,7 August 2014
