Captain Phillips," captain phillps review
","Captain Philips - 2013 Cast: tom hanks and barkhad Abdi Director: Paul greengrassSynopsis: Captain Philips is a multi-layered examination of the true story of the 2009 hijacking of the container Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates. Based on a story the film focuses on the Alabama's commanding officer captain Philips and the Somali pirate muse who takes him hostage The two men are set on an unstoppable collision course when muse and his crew target Phillip's unarmed ship in the ensuing standoff both men will find themselves at the mercy of the forces beyond their control. Review: I think this film is a fine piece of film making from one of the finest director around who previously directed 2 of the Bourne movies. At just over 2 hours long it is a very good tense story that goes on at a nice pace, though I would have probably watched it for another hour it was so exciting. I never took my eyes of the screen and the film never lost my attention. I think the most powerful aspect of the story was watching the relationship between Captain Philips and muse develops throughout the film, it goes from a hijacker and a victim to two men who understand each other and the fact that muse is a thief not a killer. I never fully felt threatened that muse was going to kill Philips because he understood he was no killer and the most frightening aspect of the film where the other 2 pirates who seemed more unpredictable than muse. However barkhad Abdi gives and incredible and scary portrayal of muse and so do the other actors playing the pirates. I was not fully aware of the real story so there were a number of shocks in this film for me for example I thought that the whole main part of the action would take place on Philips ship I was genuinely shocked when he was kidnapped in the life boat and the main part of the film took place there. I have to say that tom hanks has given some memorable performances in the past in films such as the toy story films and Forrest Gump but his performance in this film is outstanding and defiantly one of the best performances of his career. Overall I think the film was epic and thrilling from start to finish and it made me really think of what a terrifying event it would have been for the people who were involved in the real story and happily as we found out over a year later captain Phillip's would take to his ship and on to the sea yet again I would give this film a 8.5 out of 10",8,0,1,4 March 2014
The Impossible," the impossible
","Synopsis: A powerful story based on one families experience of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the impossible stars Naomi watts and Ewan McGregor and is directed by j a bayona Based on a true story, the impossible is the unforgettable account of a family caught with tens of thousands of strangers in the mayhem of one of the worst natural catastrophes of our time. Both epic and intimate devastating and uplifting, the impossible is a journey to the core of the human heartReview: j a bayona has created a very powerful drama about the effects on a whole nation during a very difficult time in our history and the story of one family triumph over the odds and survival of this terrible event. I was blown away by the special effects of the tsunami waves and the fact that this wasn't achieved by cgi but with real water and physical stunts makes it even more impressing and exciting to watch, also I was even more impressed by the performances of the lead actors, there were many amazing moments in this film and many things to love about it, I particular loved the scene were the younger boy in the family is sitting outside and an older women comes outside and the boy asks her how old she is and she says nearly 74 and she asks him his age and he says 7 and a half, it was a scene that really showed the wide scale of the disaster as if to say that everyone from age 7 and a half to 74 were affected by this event including people younger and older than that. But what I most loved about the film was the performance of tom Holland playing Lucas when he was reunited with his mum and they were both split up from the rest of the family and Lucas had to step up and take on the role of the courageous, strong character to save his own mum who was in a much worst physical position than he was and I think he stepped up to the mark and was probably the main reason why there family has a happier ending compared to other people caught up in this disaster. Overall I think this film was one of the best based on a true story films I've seen in the past 2 years and one of the most powerful on screen events that I have ever seen- 8/10",8,0,1,25 February 2014
