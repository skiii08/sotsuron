The Blair Witch Project," 'In October of 1994, the world was made a better place when three film students disappeared...'
","One of the things that really makes a movie is the characters.  There was absolutely no character to these three.  The audience never got to find out who these students really were.  Heather's personality was limited to 'bossy know-it-all', which doesn't lead one to care a great deal for her.  So who really cares if she dies?  I, for one, couldn't wait for the witch to get her, she was unbelievably rude to everyone she ran into during the course of the film!  I couldn't blame the guys for continually wanting to fight with her, she was a pain in the butt!Also, I really think that a battery company should pick up on this.  They get lost for 5 days and run out of food but amazingly enough their cameras have an endless supply of power with which to record their every step. Give me a break!",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
