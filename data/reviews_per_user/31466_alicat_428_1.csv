The New World," Simply excellent.
","I'll admit that I am a lurker here on the boards and in commenting; I read other peoples' posts without ever adding in my own comments. However, after seeing 'The New World' last night, I am compelled to share my thoughts on the film.I went into the theater not knowing what to expect. I knew nothing about Terrence Malick's work and so came in with no preconceived ideas about what his work would be like. I will admit that Colin Farrell is not my favorite actor and I was slightly suspect of what his acting might be like. I am not a professional film critic, and so will not analyze the film at such a level; there are plenty of people on this board who have already done so, and well. I will simply say that I left the theater stunned. The cinematography was beautiful, Q'Orianka Kilcher was astounding, Colin Farrell was great. It's true, the film is slow, but those who are willing to sit patiently and let the movie come to them instead of seeking out their own expectations, will be richly rewarded",9,7,14,22 January 2006
