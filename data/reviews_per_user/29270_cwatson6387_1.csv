Saturday Night Fever," User rating 6.6 - Come on folks!
","I was a bit surprised to see this film was rated 6.6 by IMDb contributors. I think it should be higher in the 7.5 - 8.0 range.It's got a killer opening scene - Travolta strutting down the street to the music of The Bee Gees.********************************************* The movie stars JT as Tony Manero, a troubled Brooklyn youth whose weekend activities are dominated by visits to the local disco. While in the disco, Tony is the king, and the visits help him to temporarily forget the reality of his life: a dead-end job, clashes with his unsupportive and squabbling parents, racial tensions in the local community, and his associations with a dead-beat gang of friends.Tony connects with the aloof Stephanie one night at the disco. Despite her initial frosty and superior attitude toward Tony, she agrees to partner with him in the dance contest after much urging. Tony then has to ditch his current partner Annette, who had actively pursued Tony, despite his obvious disdain for her. Stephanie has a job in Manhatten and is poised to move there. This awakens in Tony the need to transcend his working-class roots.After a series of twists and turns Tony and Stephanie are fall out and are reconciled although not necessarily as a couple. Will he make it to the promised land Â– I've never watched the sequel and don't really want to know, as I think the film ends at the right place.********************************************* My only disappointment with the movie was the fight scene which for a film aspiring to be realistic was unconvincing otherwise I'd be arguing for an even higher score!",9,0,1,25 August 2006
