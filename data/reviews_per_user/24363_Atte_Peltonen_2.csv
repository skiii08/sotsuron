Black Swan," Something reminiscent to The Emperor's New Clothes
","Natalie Portman performs skilfully and with dedication her part as the lead. The illogical script and gimmicky directing what comes to the centering untrue psychiatric downfall does not do any favors against demotivating and estranging well-versed viewer and as such only serves as an fantasy of the writer and director, diminishing the room to empathize. Aspires for artistic finesse evident with the style, but lacking the creativity, subtlety and thought provoking sensitivity ends up being a touch artsy. This all adds up for the film to fall far short from greatness. Acting and overall crafty cinematographic style helps to rise this above average filmmaking.",5,3,4,9 June 2014
Legends of the Fall," My take on the well recognized drama of Legends of the Fall
","I suppose this film has a reputation of being recognized as a sort of a classic in some views, to which respects I'm trying to explain my differing take emphasizing on why I only rank it a hair above average, at best. Although I find myself seeing this film only until now I have had the score over decade, as it was too, reputed. I wished a lot of things from this movie, yet it falls evenly short from its aim on a wide front. The story is to tell of the life and events centered on a family of men destined for great things and rich life. Yet the red line and meaning of all of this is missing and viewer is kept unmotivated and unengaged. There's nothing wrong with the performances of the cast, but there is also nothing great with them in ways it would raise the film to higher category on its own. The score is supposed to elevate the film and act as a coloring paint brush for the intermittently beautiful scenic photography and strong moments, yet it is thoroughly uncreative and uninspiring and I have always thought it is much overrated, as an attempt at sentimentality is not a redeeming quality on its own. In my opinion the relatively short ending moments are where the movie is at it's best.",4,0,1,1 February 2014
