Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Good offensive content, physical humor...and not much more
","I must make these disclaimers--I may be one of a few people who have never seen Da Ali G, or known much more about Borat than a couple of TV trailers. But I do have a keen sense of taste for offensiveness as well as critical commentary. I can say that this film is great in terms of pure and blatant offensiveness. Fair game is made of all people, 'retards', blacks, whites, Jews, evangelicals, Southerners...I know I'm forgetting a few others. But, frankly, this approach is nothing new, and is in many ways only a repeat or an extension of comic territory that Sarah Silverman has owned on the stand-up circuit. Admittedly, Cohen delivers well, with explosively offensive and entertaining work.The plot, while covered by other viewers, is simple and needs little explanation--Borat--the tongue-in-cheek government representative from Kazakhstan, comes to America for the promotion of economic development, and goes along embarrassing himself and everyone he meets. He catches eye of Pamela Anderson on TV, gets smitten, and convinced to marry her, he travels to California to find her--and he does. The rest just has to be seen, as you will see, plot is not critical to understanding or enjoying (or disliking) this movie.But beyond that, the movie does not deliver any substantive critical commentary, and has an equivalent social value as Jackass (I or II). At points, Cohen extracts ignorant (and sometimes drunken) statements from citizens that are racist, sexist, and so on. Those comments, if anything, do not expose any 'dark underbelly' of America--they are soundbites from the socially dimmest (or drunkest)...They cast no more light on the underbelly as the Mel Gibson statements to the cops. We already know this is there and I can hardly think that the small bits of reel on these parts give any significantly deep form to this film's ambition.Instead, you have what you have...an obnoxious and offensive loon acting out. Overall, I was entertained, but because this movie does not really conquer any real new ground other than providing ample male nudity (a rarity here in the States), the movie delivers only some yuks. The collateral damage provoked by this movie really warrants that the movie deliver something more than just laughs. If I were to rate this movie any higher, I would have to rate Jackass a 9 or a 10. Instead, they should be about the same.",7,60,99,5 November 2006
