The Blair Witch Project," Didn't do it for me
","I remember when this movie came out 6 years ago. All of the commercials and critic reviews made the movie sound like it was going to scare my pants off; how wrong I was.To make my review short: nothing really happens. I think Family Guy summed up this movie best when Bryan is a seeing eye dog for a blind man and he narrates 'There in the woods...nothing happens...there still in the woods, a girl is crying...uhm...nothing happens' I could make an easy fortune narrating this movie for people who can not see very well; I could just say that they're just in the woods and I would have done my job. Some parts are a bit creepy...if you think that toilet paper roll ups hanging on a tree are the stuff of nightmares that is. Its so random, but not random in a good way like Monty Python. Typical scene 'Where we going?*camera off* I WANT TO GO HOME!' The filming is creative but its just a bad conceptI remember being at the theater, sitting down, and the movie suddenly ends. Credits are rolling and I look around to see if anyone had left; most of the people were so utterly confused, they did not know what was going on. I thought maybe the credits were a trick. 'Ah,they're going to filter out the impatient ones since nothing has happened so far!' oh how wrong I was...In short, this is pretty hit or miss; its as accurate as a monkey trying to aim for a toilet while on the ceiling.",3,1,2,7 May 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Like watching paint dry
","When I bought this movie I thought it was going to be a grand epic adventure. Although it was that, it failed to keep my attention. I have a very good attention span and never fall asleep during movies but I just couldn't sit still during this movie. The story was good and the directing was good but it lacked action. Not fighting action but I mean as in stuff happens because nothing really happens. Its very corny 'You shall not pass!'so corny. Reminds me of a Dungeons and Dragons meet or something. Although the last movie in the series is good,this certainly isn't; I had a tough time falling asleep once so I decided to watch this movie and that became my replacement for warm milk. Great for fans but for anyone else this will fail to catch your interest.",2,4,9,18 June 2005
Alien vs. Predator," Hopefully not the final chapter
","I was very disappointed by this movie. As a fan of the original alien series(except resurrection) I was expecting something mildly decent; like all of my assumptions, I was wrong as usual. The plot was really good but it was poorly executed. The introduction of how Weyland Yutani began was a nice add on. Where the movie goes wrong,however, is its cast. They tried to be too 'Extreme'. You've got all these 'scientists' who rock climb and do extreme sports and what-not to make the 'ultimate' cast. What happened to the non-extreme scientists that made 'Alien' so great? Or the marines in 'Predator' and 'Aliens'? The great thing about 'Alien' was the vulnerability in the characters.In this movie though(even though the characters are slightly vulnerable) everyone has a gun for some unknown reason; its not like they knew there would be aliens. I did like how they tied in the Alien and Predator theme though. It was disappointing.*Spoiler*What stabs the movie in the back is the ending. The lady and the predator team up. What the hell is this? It seems like the writers were running out of ideas or had a time limit for the movie to run in; it just seemed so thrown in. It just does not make sense. She says 'wait wait...I'm your friend' as if the predator could understand her. He then goes on to create a weapon. The finisher to this smack in the face is when the lady and the predator grab hands,look at each other in acknowledgment, and jump on to the elevator that whisks them away to safety. Poorly executed.People who may like this: people who cant sit still for 5 minutes,someone looking for a cheap rental, and people who are not familiar with the originals.",6,0,2,7 May 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Living History
","Saving Private Ryan may not be a completely accurate portrayal of the western front in WW2, but it does have something in common with its equally great descendant 'Band of Brothers'. What this film does is make it feel like you are there: from Omaha Beach to Ramelle.. No other film does that. Its almost as if they went back in time and filmed this; its almost 'genuine'.One of the things that stand out most in this film is the effects.You experience the sound of bullet whizzes,explosions,and the eerie sound of approaching tanks on a quiet little bombed out town. The film's opening scene has been billed as the best D-Day scene of all time and it rightly deserves that.Now,there are a few historical inaccuracies people have noticed (such as the Church tower in Ramelle which,according to German tactics,would of have been destroyed as it would give an advantage to the enemy) but I don't think it will detract from the film. The question this film poses is if it is truly worth it to sacrifice the lives of many for one person. I think with the current situation in Israel with the kidnapped soldiers, this question has never been so apparent.So,although its not a great way to learn WW2 history,its a great way to experience it.Like many others this film got me interested in the period.",10,2,3,20 July 2006
Dumb and Dumber," I loved this movie in 1994,I still love it now
","This movie is brilliant. Its a simple premise but thats why it succeeds so well. There's so many memorable parts in this movie, its so hard to remember all of them. Carrey and Daniels are a great pair in this movie. I still see it today on TBS and laugh my *** off! I don't want to give much away, but if you love intelligent dimwitted comedy(oxymoron) then watch this classic. The plot is great too.Carrie is a limo driver in Providence,RI who brings a young woman to an airport. She drops her suitcase at the airport and Carrie attempts to bring the suitcase back to her. Daniels and Carrie are both fired from their job and decide to take a cross country trip to give the poor woman her suitcase. Little do they know, the suitcase contained money that belongs to the mob. Hilarity ensues.",10,0,1,13 May 2005
