First Man," His long eyelashes shone in space
","I look forward to this biographical movie when I see the name. What kind of story will I tell about this character experience?My personal favorite is that the film chooses to tell from a personal point of view.Combining the rapid switching of the camera makes each section of the bridge that performs the task encounter an accident. It is particularly thrilling and especially catches people. Especially many lens details can reflect the character's uneasy tension and anxiety. This is done very well. On the contrary, it is really the last process from launching to the moon. It seems that the long lens on the moon's surface is calm and empty and beautiful. The whole process is like the psychological reaction of the character. It is not excitement and excitement but great pressure. After the task is completed, the past is relieved.The film avoids a large number of main themes and political elements. The point is so far. It shows the influence of the pressure of social public opinion on the characters and reflects people's thinking about the significance of this moon landing. However, it is a pity that the emotional drama with the family is not enough.It can be seen that the film wants to express Neil's hard work and concentration. On the one hand, it is also to forget the pain of losing the daughter. To avoid talking with the family about the task, I don't want them to worry about dropping the daughter's bracelet after landing on the moon, and the goodbye in the past should have been tender but actual watching. The experience is not enough to make the audience enter the show, but the characters appear to be Facebook. Neil is more like a working machine focused on the moon and the family's emotional drama. It is only like passing the set. This makes the last moment of throwing the bracelet not powerful enough. The movie watching process also seems to have been difficult before the preparation process, but it was particularly worrying, but the most important part of the moon landing was emotionally relieved and a bit discouraged. Presumably the script if the script can make the emotional drama part of the character more concentrated, then some real emotional savings will eventually be More moving to reach sublimationGenerally speaking, the good part is very good, but the whole can definitely be better, but unfortunately it is impossible to remake in the short term, even if someone else shoots this biography, it is not necessary to start from this angle.",7,0,0,21 June 2020

Milk," Shy and determined weak attacker
","This is a movie about gay politicians. The director did not lead the film to the sensational path of striving for equality and finally tragic sacrifice, nor did he try to create a high-profile people idol, but used objective and plain images to tell a gay politician, a first taste of power and play The story of gay politicians with political skills. There are no political views in the film, and the politicians who have lashed out at gays and repulsed them have not done any moral judgment or mockery. Perhaps the hardest thing to do in a biographical film with a sensitive topic is to take out the texture of being outside and thinking calmly. Siempan contributed legendary acting. The self-deprecating and good-spoken politician he shaped may be the most impressive of the film actor's warm smile. The close-up of the side face makes every wrinkle exude Milk shyness. But a firm breath. There are very few such civil rights fighters in China. On the one hand, it is a special cause of domestic politics, and on the other hand, it is also because of the mean culture that the Chinese have always upheld. The Chinese will not use religion and belief to oppress the weak, or even kill their lives. The Chinese are most comfortable with it. After a long time, if they are not strange, they will settle down without interference.",7,0,0,13 June 2020

Silver Linings Playbook," Two injured hearts can also warm each other
","The biggest inspiration from this movie is that two injured hearts can also warm each other.I used to think that only in a perfect family that was loved and nurtured would grow into a sunny, simple, and kind character; the various connections between people who have experienced misfortunes seem to only let the misfortune suddenly erupt and exacerbate the misfortune, Leading to a vicious circle entangled in the native family.Although the mistress lost her husband in an accident, she once had sex with many colleagues because she couldn't control her grief.

This kind of character who dares to love and hate is really pleasing.The male host is a foil, the whole process is passive and slow to accept the existence of the female host. He was out of control when he discovered that his wife was suffering from mental illness. After leaving the hospital, he only wanted to work hard with his wife, and he met a female host who suddenly broke into his life, and her fate was reversed at this moment.There is always a line of happiness behind the dark clouds.
