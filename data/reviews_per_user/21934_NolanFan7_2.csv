Midnight in Paris," Welcome to the French Surrealism
","Human being has a nature that he can't satisfy himself at any condition. When a man think that there's something missing in his world than there's always an unexpected event waiting down for him to change his course of life. MIDNIGHT IN Paris is a simple story of a man named Gil(Owen Wilson) who thought that his Hollywood world is not that quiet exciting and not fulfilling his writer skills as he wanted to write novels. Than he gets the chance to go to Paris with his beautiful girlfriend(Rachel McAdams) and her family for a business trip. He always knew that Paris is the land of LOVE and ART but he felt that when he encountered that place. Beautiful views of streets, rivers, lamps, landmarks etc makes protagonist fall in love with Paris. He decides to stay here forever but not everyone feel good about that. His great love for Paris leads him to some beautiful illusions which in the end makes him realize that this is what he was missing in his life i.e. ART and LOVE.Allen's cinematographers never compromised to show how beautiful Paris is, every single view into the screen is in detailed form and showed with spectacular camera work. Especially the ending scene when Eiffel Tower was lightning beautifully. Whole screenplay is one the best part of the movie. Exciting Story-line helps to meet some of the beautiful characters who keeps us engaged till the end. Dialogues are good and written very well keeping a view of French-France in mind.As expected, all the performers are superb. From leading actor Wilson to supporting actor Adrien Brody all are superb. Special remarks for Marion Cotillard, she is looking so beautiful and stealing every second she is on the screen.First movie of the year which i felt is Technically natural. Filmed in old fashioned style which is refreshingly cool. U have never seen Paris that beautiful in any past Hollywood films. Movie takes place in my year's top 5. With Wonderful direction of the great Woody Allen and comical-adventurous journey of Paris this movie deserves 10/10. Must watch for those who respect and love ART.",9,1,2,18 October 2011
