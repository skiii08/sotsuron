Walk the Line," Wonderful Story!
","Truly one of the all time greats. Very impressive, very well done. Excellent quality, excellent acting, excellent story, excellent music.Awesome sound!! How on earth were they able to get those 2 actors to sound like the real singers?? They might have average voices but somehow they were able to make this sound 100% real and authentic. I loved seeing the old Fender,Gibson and Martin guitars. The clothes, hards, cars, guitars, homes, hotels---everything looked like it came out of a time machine!!! I like movies that are historically accurate. I don't know too much about Mr. Cash but I hope they did his family and his life's story justice with the movie. I loved seeing the peripheral characters too--Sam Phillips, Elvis, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis.Hollywood knew what we wanted to see and hear. It's like they listened to Mr. Sam Phillips advice to Johnny Cash at the first audition--'you have to believe in yourself--play songs that make people want to buy them'",10,1,1,19 March 2012
