Iron Man 3," Iron Man returns
","without leaving any spoilers this film is superior to Iron Man 2 has a better script, acting and fits nicely into the current Marvel universe.I enjoyed the film and where they took it - the action scenes worked and it has despite some reviews on here a very clever script.I give this movie a 10 because its clever, funny, sad with clear opinions on today's world!The action sequences also make sense to the script and are not used as filler which I think enhances the film.The acting is great from the lead characters but I always get the sense that Pepper's character needs a little more evolution as we never really in any of the three get to understand WHY she is so perfect for Tony Stark.My son is already wanting to go back again as am I ! I rarely go see a movie twice but this will join that list",10,8,20,30 April 2013
