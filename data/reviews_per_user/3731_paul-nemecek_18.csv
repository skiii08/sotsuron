The Legend of Bagger Vance," Great mythmaking
","The Legend of Bagger Vance is about golf in the same way that Field of Dreams was about baseball--that is, hardly at all. This film has the mystic symbolism of Field of Dreams, the sense of time and place of A River Runs Through It, and the triumph of spirit that is at the center of most of my favorite films. It might be an accident that the number of holes played in this epic showdown is about the same as the number of years we get in the big game (on average), but this film is quite clearly about the game of life.Matt Damon plays Rannulph Junuh, a promising golfer from Savannah whose prodigious career is interrupted, and ultimately diverted, by World War I. He comes back from the war changed, and neglects both his game and his girl as he attempts to drown his sorrows by killing off brain cells little by little. When the Great Depression hits, the whole town of Savannah is devastated and Adele attempts to save the family estate by staging an epic golf match on the golf course her father had designed. The two greatest golfers of the time are enticed to play in the epic, but the town wants Junuh in the game too, to represent Savannah. Young Hardy Greaves has been a fan of Junuh's almost since birth and Hardy does his best to convince Junuh to enter the fray. When Hardy fails, Adele also tries and also fails, but then Junuh meets Bagger Vance--caddy, wisdom teacher, and philosopher extraodinaire. To say much more about the relationship that develops would be to give away too much of the suspense that propels the story forward. Suffice it to say that Will Smith's portrayal of Bagger Vance is an intriguing mix of Cheech Marin in Tin Cup and Obi Wan Kanobi in Star Wars.It is the mythic dimension that makes this a satisfying film. Like two of his previous films (The Horse Whisperer and A River Runs Through It), this film is best when viewed as myth and metaphor. The brilliant cinematography by Michael Ballhaus contributes to the mythic feel of the film. If there is a flaw in the film it is a relatively minor one. As in A River Runs Through It, director Redford chose to tell this story as one long flashback using extensive voice-over narration. Especially in the beginning of the film, I found this to be intrusive and a bit distracting.Aside from this minor flaw, this is a wonderful film about grace and redemption, with rich images and refreshing themes. As I left the theater I ran into an acquaintance who is an avid golfer. He said, 'I've played courses just like that one.' I don't golf at all, so it is a real tribute to the mythic qualities of the film that I was able to walk away saying to myself 'me too, me too.'",9,2,4,8 July 2018
Antz," Debugging Antz
","Part of the fun of the movie Antz is that on works on many different levels and as several different stories. Children might enjoy it as simply a cute animated film (although the aftermath of the battle between the ants vs. the termites earned Antz a PG rating). At another level, Antz is the old girl-meet-boy from the wrong side of the tracks story). The film is also part adventure film with political intrigue and action. At yet another level, the film is an interesting political parable complete with sophisticated humor and witty dialogue.Antz is about Ant Z, a neurotic worker ant in a colony of millions of ants. The movie opens with Ant Z lying on the psychiatrist's couch asking questions about the meaning of life, and the needs of the individual as opposed to the society as a whole. Fittingly, the voice, neuroses, and mannerisms of Ant Z are provided by Woody Allen. Sharon Stone provides the voice of Princess Bala, daughter of the queen of the ants. Princess Bala meets Z when she goes to a working-class bar. There is a cute dance sequence here complete with imitations of John Travolta and Uma Thurman from Pulp Fiction.
 
The one part of the movie that could use some debugging is the political parable. There are some references to the class system that could have been written by Karl Marx. There are other times when Ant Z rallies the troops around the themes of individualism and autonomy. In short, the film is a bit unfocused in terms of its central theme, and as a result, the political parable is the least satisfying of the elements.If we don't take this part too seriously, we can still enjoy the film. Additional voices are provided by Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, Danny Glover, and Jennifer Lopez (too name a few). The computer-generated animation is excellent. The dialogue is witty and well-written with lots of tongue-in-cheek references to contemporary culture. For example, when Ant Z is in trouble, a chorus of Ants starts singing 'all we are saying, is give Z a chance.' All in all, not a bad summary evaluation for the film as a whole.",7,1,1,3 July 2018
Erin Brockovich," Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich
","Erin Brockovich is a modern-day David vs. Goliath story with a few notable exceptions. The villainous behemoth in this version is a faceless corporate conglomerate. The hero is a sassy, brassy, less-than-classy female with a prominently featured chassis. In the basic elements of the story line, this is a story we have heard before. The crusader vs. the corporation is a dominant theme in The China Syndrome, A Civil Action, and this year's Oscar nominee The Insider. The version where the 'good guy' is a female working-class hero is the basic theme of Norma Rae and Silkwood. Like these latter films, Erin Brockovich is based on a real character and a real-life incident.Erin Brockovich is a twice-divorced mother with kids who finagles her way into a job working for the lawyer who lost her case in a civil trial. Erin is feisty, determined, independent, and mouthy. These very traits that get her into trouble with co-workers, friends, and family members are the traits that prove to be her greatest assets as a secretary turned paralegal. What makes the character sympathetic is her caring. She does not always show it well, but beneath the tough exterior is a woman with a heart of gold who cares deeply about her kids and is passionately committed to the families affected by corporate neglect.Julia Roberts is well-suited for the 'brassy broad with a heart-of-gold' role. Consider her past performances in Pretty Woman (hooker with a heart of gold), Notting Hill (superstar with a heart of gold), and My Best Friend's Wedding (scheming, conniving, two-faced backstabber with a heart of gold). How could she miss?What distinguishes this film from films like Norma Rae or Silkwood however, is the witty script by screenwriter Susannah Grant. Grant was the screenwriter for Pocahantas, Ever After, and 28 Days. What these films have in common is strong-willed independent female characters. Here the synthesis of Brockovich's character, Grant's writing, and Julia Roberts' persona all work together like a charm. The best way to turn an old formula into a good film is through distinctive characters. The characters and their relationships are the real heart of this film.As a result, the film is much lighter in tone than Norma Rae or Silkwood. There are moments of high drama, but the film really shines in its humor and wit. Albert Finney is delightful as Ed Masry, Erin's boss. Julia Roberts turns in what may prove to be the best performance of her career as a working-class mom who refuses to stay down for the count. Director Steven Soderbergh (Out of Sight, The Limey) handles the material well and the pacing of the film is nearly perfect.Corporate neglect will become an increasingly important topic as evidenced by events in Seattle last year. By some estimates, there may be as many as 100,000 deaths per year (four times the homicide rate) as a result of 'corporate crime.' Erin Brockovich manages to raise the issue in a context that is neither preachy nor smug. But in the end this is not an issue film, but a character study, and what a character she is! Both thumbs up for Erin Brockovich.",10,3,4,1 July 2018
Meet the Parents," Not Profound, But Pretty Funny
","In comedic films, the plot is often a secondary consideration. Like an unplanned vacation, the destination is not what's important--it's the journey itself that matters. Meet the Parents is a predictable plot based on an overused clich√©, and I give it two thumbs up. What counts here is not the plot, it's the humor and the performances that make it worth the ride.Jay Roach is the director who inflicted Austin Powers on humanity. Fortunately, he is able to dial it down a notch here and give us humor that is a little more subtle--not much, but every bit helps. Ben Stiller plays the unfortunately named Greg Focker, who is on his way to meet the parents of the woman he loves. His character here is almost a reprise of his character in There's Something About Mary. Greg is desperate to make a good impression on his girlfriend's parents and his general anxiety turns into full-blown terror when he meets Pam's father, Jack Byrnes. Jack (played by Robert DeNiro) is a rather humorless man who deep down believes that no man could be good enough for his little girl.Greg has been led to believe that Jack is a retired florist, but he soon discovers that Jack has an entirely different, and much darker, past. DeNiro is perfectly cast as the foreboding father figure, and DeNiro plays the part superbly. Greg soon discovers that even the most benign chatter is a kind of test, and he feels--quite rightly--that he is failing miserably.Virtually every character in this story lies to another character at one time or another. Much of the humor revolves around little lies that necessitate either full confessions or even bigger lies. The characters choose bigger lies almost every time. ('Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive'). The biggest laughs come as we watch Greg trying to extricate himself from one of his self-spun webs or as we watch Jack setting another trap.The tone of the film reminded me of Father of the Bride. Like that film, the predictability of the plot doesn't really matter. We know from the beginning how it will ultimately end. Films like this rise or fall on the strength of the writing and the power of the performances. While there are thoroughly adequate supporting performances here, the real dynamic comes in the chemistry between Stiller and DeNiro. This is not great art or profound social commentary. But the audience roared as they watched these characters play out situations that were close enough to real to make them feel the embarrassment and frustration of the central characters. If you don't get a chance to see it at the theater, save it for a video rental. For extra fun, invite your future in-laws and see if they think it's funny.",7,1,1,6 July 2018
Unbreakable," Unbreakable in Unbearable
","I looked forward to M. Night Shymalan's Unbreakable with great anticipation. Shymalan's previous film as writer-director was last year's innovative thriller The Sixth Sense. I was, alas, pretty disappointed in this film. In the end, this film was not unbearably suspenseful, it was simply unbearable.The film reunites Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson (Die Hard with a Vengeance and Pulp Fiction), two great actors wasted in a maudlin mess of mediocrity. Samuel L. Jackson plays a comic book collector suffering from a rare disease that leaves his bones brittle and easily broken. Bruce Willis plays a security guard who is the sole survivor of a disastrous train wreck. Not only has he survived, but he survived without a scratch. Could it be that he is unbreakable?To be fair, there are inspired moments of writing here, but the whole is decidedly smaller than the parts. The film's tone is uneven--so much so that the audience laughed hysterically at one of the more dramatic scenes--and the acting is pretty flat. In fact, Shymalan's line from The Sixth Sense, 'I see dead people' might be more relevant here. The central character follows a fairly traditional hero's quest, but the character has such a flat personality that I was left feeling pretty uninspired. The comic-book ending made the film seem even more disjointed. Throwing together a bunch of talented people does not necessarily result in a talented film.If you are in the mood for heroes and unbreakable characters, I would recommend two other films currently playing rather than this lackluster loser. Remember the Titans is inspiring, relevant, and wonderfully told. Men of Honor is a wonderful story of courage and character. Both films deal with racism and heroic responses. These are both four-star films in my book. If you really want to see Unbreakable, wait for the video. This is a film that will not lose much in the transfer to the small screen, and if your expectations and the price of admission are a bit lower, you might even enjoy it.",5,0,6,8 July 2018
The Mummy," The Mummy for Dummies
","In Joseph Boggs' book The Art of Watching Films, Boggs suggests that we should consider the level of ambition of a film in evaluating that film. That is, we shouldn't criticize Sleepless in Seattle for not being Schindler's List. Sleepless in Seattle set out to be a sweet romantic comedy and achieved that goal quite nicely. Stephen Sommers' The Mummy appears to have been spawned with a fairly low level of ambition in mind. The good news(?) is that the director achieved his goal. About the only saving grace of this film is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.The Mummy is loosely based on the Boris Karloff classic from years gone by. Brendan Fraser plays Rick O'Connell, a soldier of fortune, who knows the way to a famous lost city in Egypt. Rachel Wiesz plays Evelyn, a librarian and would-be archaeologist who joins forces with O'Connell and a few other cliches to find the city and uncover hidden treasures. In trying to uncover the treasure they unleash a curse (guess who) and yotta yotta yotta . . .  One of the few bright spots in the film is John Hannah in a supporting role as Evelyn's brother. Hannah's previous films include Four Weddings and a Funeral and Sliding Doors. His part is more slapstick sidekick here but he carries it off quite nicely. There are some excellent special effects, but I am frankly more than a little weary of films that put special effects where the plot is supposed to be. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz do okay in their roles, but their roles are really not worth much effort.In the end, The Mummy looks like the offspring of a misbegotten marriage between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Ghostbusters. Unfortunately, it's not as funny as the latter, nor as exciting as the former, and ends up being a 'C minus' grade B film. There are a few scenes that make it inadvisable for kids under thirteen. The rest of the scenes make the film inadvisable for anyone with an IQ greater than that of the average four year-old. Next time out writer-director Sommers would do well to set his sights just a little bit higher.",6,3,6,6 July 2018
The Matrix Revolutions," The Grand Finale
","I have to confess that I went to see this film with fear and trepidation. I have been a big fan of the Matrix trilogy and I was afraid that the finale would be a major letdown. Sequels are a risky business at best. If you've seen Rocky V, Jaws 3-D, or any of the Halloween movies after the first one you know of what I speak. In Rocky for example, we meet characters, situations, and places that are fresh and new. The hero's quest is as old as mythmaking itself but the new contexts and characters allow us to approach old myths in new ways. As each successive sequel was made, the myth became trite and clich√©d, the characters devolve into caricatures, and the formulaic nature of the films makes them mundane and boring.It is admittedly a difficult task to keep the mythmaking fresh and awe-inspiring. I am pleased to report that the Wachowski brothers succeed in doing just that. I read several reviews that were fairly negative about the film, but as I read the reviews it was clear to me that the critics simply didn't get it. They reminded me of the critic who criticized Field of Dreams for not being as good as other baseball movies. If you have seen Field of Dreams you know that that film is not really a baseball movie at all.As in the previous films, there is an abundance of special effects in the battle sequences. There are also more sparks in the relationship between Trinity and Neo. In my review of the original film I praised the film because of the abstractness of the mythology. When we try to literalize metaphors they lose much of their power. Neo-Marxists, Buddhists, and Christians could all walk away from this film feeling as if the film had strengthened their faith. If we look at the film as a commentary on the postmodern world, the Architect and the Oracle become perfect metaphors for the competing voices of modernity and postmodernity respectively. One of the reasons I was nervous about this final installment was my concern about the Messianic Neo character. The Christological images are fairly strong in the film, but I have always had a problem with Neo as a machine-gun toting Messiah. Once I let go of my literal reading of this metaphor I was able to appreciate the richer metaphors contained in the film. I resonate with the film's critique of the 'domination system' (to borrow a phrase from Walter Wink's The Powers That Be), but I did not want this film to degenerate into yet another legitimation of the myth of redemptive violence. Fortunately, it does not . . . to say more is to give away too much of the ending. This will not be everyone's cup of tea, and more than a few viewers will leave scratching their heads or disappointed that there wasn't even more computer-generated mayhem. But for those who have eyes to see, this film is clearly worth a look.",9,4,7,6 July 2018
Being John Malkovich," Being John Malkovich is a Wild Ride
","This has been a great year for alternate realities at the movies. Films like The Matrix, Sixth Sense, Blair Witch Project, Thirteenth Floor, and Run, Lola, Run have all, in different ways, played with the line that separates past from present, reality from simulation, and truth from fiction. Being John Malkovich can be added to this list of innovative films that a recent issue of Entertainment Weekly described as the first films of the 21st century.There is little in this film that is formula. John Cusack plays a gifted puppeteer who aspires to be one of the world's great puppeteers. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of job openings for puppeteers so he is reduced to street theater where he is clearly underappreciated. An almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz plays Cusack's wife, a pet lover who is just a little quirky. When Cusack decides to take a job as a file clerk on floor 7.5 of an office building, life becomes even weirder. Cusack discovers an opening behind a file cabinet, a little door that leads into a tunnel. Like the characters in C.S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, (or Alice Through the Looking Glass), Cusack jumps in and finds himself in an alternative universe. Instead of Narnia or Wonderland, Cusack finds himself on a 15-minute ride inside actor John Malkovich (played quite capably by . . . John Malkovich).Cusack joins forces with a co-worker to create a business. For $200 people can spend 15 minutes inside of John Malkovich's head, seeing the world through his eyes. Since this is even better than Real World or a WebCam show, people come in droves. Eventually, Malkovich himself discovers what's going on and jumps the line to go inside of his own mind. This leads to what has to be one of the more unique scenes in the history of film. 
The story takes on an even more interesting twist when Cusack finds a unique way to fulfill his lifelong dream of being the world's greatest puppeteer.This is one weird film--and I've left out some of the weird. This is also one of the most creative films I have seen, and the film raises interesting questions about consciousness, identity, love and meaning. There are great performances here by Cusack, Diaz, Malkovich, and Catherine Keener (Cusack's co-worker and eventual love interest). The real star of the show, however, is the story itself. First-time screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has crafted an interesting and innovative story. First-time director Spike Jonze handles the material extremely well. This is clearly not a film for all tastes, and the language and sexual scenes may well offend. This is, however, something that is very rare, in Hollywood--innovative, creative, and thought provoking. Watch for this film during the Oscar nominations. If this doesn't get nominated for screenplay--at least--I will hang up my trophy.",9,6,6,3 July 2018
Hardball," Hardball Goes Down Swinging
","Hardball is a well-intentioned, tender-hearted film that gets lost in clich√©s, stereotypes, and bad writing. Keanu Reeves plays Coner O'Neal, a heavy-drinking compulsive gambler who is clearly down on his luck. When he asks a stockbroker-friend to loan him some money, his friend instead offers him a job-coaching Little League ball players for $500 a week. The catch is that this particular Little League team is made up of residents from Cabrini-Green, Chicago's most notorious public housing project.So, we end up with the white mentor meets black street kid clich√© (Finding Forrester). The basic plot line of the film is the standard sports film clich√©. For me, almost all sports films are variations of Rocky. For example, Hoosiers is 'rural Rockies play basketball'. The Mighty Ducks could be subtitled 'little Rockies play hockey'. Even Cool Runnings is 'Jamaican Rockies go bob-sledding'. The closest parallel is probably Bad News Bears, but Mighty Ducks is a close second.As is the case in many of these films, the basic formula is loser coach coaches loser athletes and they all become winners in the end. A common subplot occurs when the down-and-out coach loses faith in himself, but is propped up by the love of a good woman ('Yo' Adrian'). As I have stated before formula can be okay, if you create richly drawn characters and interesting contexts with unusual plot twists that keep us in suspense. Alas, Hardball had none of this.This is essentially a formula film with poorly developed characters, few innovations, and flat interpersonal relationships throughout the film. If you are interested in the film because you like sports films, see any of the other films listed above on video instead. Major League II even looks good by comparison. If your primary interest is in the lives of low-income minorities in the inner city check out the documentary Hoop Dreams, Menace II Society, Boyz in the Hood, or Clockers. If the interracial mentoring is what appeals, Finding Forrester is a much better choice. If you were interested in this film because you are a Keanu Reeves fan, see your therapist or wait for Matrix II.To be fair, there was one moment at the end of the film that was poignant, well-acted, and moving. This is a clear case of too little too late though. The film ended by swinging for the fences, but in the final analysis Hardball went down swinging.",5,0,1,3 July 2018
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," An Ang Lee Masterpiece
","Critics have bemoaned the lack of quality in the films turned out in the year just past. With the exception of a few epic films like Gladiator and The Patriot, Steven Soderbergh's two films Erin Brockovich and Traffic, and some lesser known 'art films' like Billy Elliot and You Can Count on Me, quality films have been in short supply. The really notable exception to this year's drought is Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.I saw this film over Christmas break in Washington D.C. To say that the audience was captivated would be a significant understatement. On two separate occasions the audience burst into applause in the middle of the film. They don't make them like they used to, but once in a while they make them even better.This may seem like an odd film for Ang Lee whose previous credits include Sense and Sensibility. What makes this film exceptional is that it combines the sensibilities of the romance film with the sensory ecstasy of a ballet. This film is frequently compared to The Matrix and the martial arts choreography is done by the same person--Yuen Wo-Ping. At many points the choreography is closer in style to the kinetic grace of ballet than to the rough-and-tumble action of the traditional fight scene.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of those films that has something for everyone. This is a traditional hero's quest where the central characters are trying to find a stolen sword that has great symbolic meaning for the characters. Unlike most Westerns or Samurai films wherein women are little more than moveable props, the women here are strong central characters in their own right. Romance is really at the center of the film and Ang Lee handles this part of the story with the same graceful unfolding that made Sense and Sensibility such an excellent film. Like The Matrix there are meanings at deeper levels where we find Jungian shadows, Yin and Yang, and almost anything else you want to look for.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has already won a number of awards including Golden Globes for best foreign language film and best director. Look for it to feature prominently in the Academy Award nominations. It may well become the third foreign language film in the past decade--Life is Beautiful and Il Postino being the other two--to be nominated for best picture. Whatever its destiny at the Academy Awards, this is clearly one of the best films of the year and is definitely worth a look.",10,3,4,2 July 2018
The Game," Game on!
","What do you get when you blend the narrative structure of 'The Usual Suspects' with Alfred Hitchcock's theme of the ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances, and the moral universe of Anton Chekhov's short story 'The Bet'? You get this finely crafted thriller directed by David Fincher (Alien3 and Seven) and starring Michael Douglas (Falling Down, The American President).Michael Douglas plays a wealthy investment broker who appears to have it all. For his 48th birthday, his younger brother (well-played by Sean Penn) gives him a gift designed for the man who has everything-a membership in a recreational services club that custom-designs experiences to meet the unique voids of each individual client (or so they say). The catch is that clients never know what's coming, and the line between real life and 'the game' gets more and more blurred as the story unfolds.The movie pushes credibility to the limits, and occasionally, beyond. But the story is engaging enough that I found myself restraining my disbelief until after the ride was over. One of the things that can make this an enjoyable movie-going experience is taking some friends along who like to probe deeper meanings.'The Game' works not only as an engaging thriller, but also as a moral parable, a social commentary on the hollowness of contemporary society, and a kind of philosophical riddle. Viktor Frankl has described the illness of modern humanity as noogenic neurosis-an existential vacuum in the soul-that leaves us longing for deeper meaning. While 'The Game' does not offer profound solutions, it does provide an engaging story about the problem.",9,2,4,8 July 2018
Meet Joe Black," Meet Joe Black
","In the recent thriller The Edge, Anthony Hopkins played a wealthy businessman who is transformed by a harrowing encounter with death. In Meet Joe Black, Anthony Hopkins plays Bill, a similar character confronting similar themes, but with a very different twist. Here he meets Death as played by Brad Pitt. Death informs Bill that he wants to see what life is like and he wants Bill to teach him. So long as Death is interested and learning, Bill gets more time. When Bill has to introduce Death to his family at dinner, he fumbles around for a name, eventually coming up with Joe Black.This is hardly the first film to depict bargains with Death. In Ingmar Bergman's Seventh Seal the allegorical figure of death (complete with shroud) is challenged to a game of chess. His intended victim hopes to forestall the inevitable. Bergman's Death character is reprised in Woody Allen's Love and Death, The Last Action Hero, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. In Meet Joe Black we are spared the shroud since Death decided to borrow a body from one of his victims. (If you gotta' have one, might as well borrow one that looks like Brad Pitt, I guess.)The real twist in this film comes in what could be taken as the sub-plot. Death falls in love with Bill's daughter Susan. Susan is involved with Drew, her father's right-hand man in the business world. Drew meanwhile is conniving at some underhanded business deals of his own. The plot takes more than a few twists and turns along the way, but in the end it is neither the plot nor the grand theme (if there is one) that makes the film engaging. Sometimes its the ride itself that makes the journey worthwhile.Frankly, there are more than a few problems of plausibility here (even after we grant willing suspension of disbelief to the central premise). As one small example, Joe Black is fluent in Jamaican patois, but doesn't know how to tie a tie. The cinematography is good, but not outstanding, and the performances are no more that what we would expect under the circumstances.Still in all, there were more than a few moments along the way where the audience laughed pretty hard. At one point the audience applauded (in the middle of the movie no less), and I'm sure there were more than a few smiles on more than a few occasions. By the end of the film, director Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman) has given us quite a few simple pleasures along the way. If there is a grand theme to the film, perhaps that is it . . . . it's the simple pleasures that make life good, and in the end, caring is everything.",8,2,3,8 July 2018
8 Mile," 8 Mile
","There is a close-up two-shot near the end of Eight Mile where Jimmy Smith (Eminem) is facing Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie). Both characters are in profile in a shot very reminiscent of Sly Stallone facing off with Mr. T in Rocky II. This is as it should be. When we look at the structure and theme of the film, Eight Mile could easily be described as Rocky does rap.In the Rocky movies (and for that matter in Flashdance), working-class nobodies in dead-end jobs are given a shot at the big time-a title match and admission to an elite ballet school respectively. While the formula is similar in all three films there are marked differences that make Eight Mile more than just another formula film.In this film, the American dream mythology is pushed to the background, and the lives of the inhabitants of the neighborhood are moved to the foreground. This movie also ends differently than the others, and the difference is important, but giving movie endings away is a major violation of the film critic's creed.I like movies where the setting becomes a character in its own right. Here the setting is just south of Eight Mile Rd. in Detroit. Eight Mile Rd. separates the poorer black community from the wealthy white suburban community, and Eminem plays a white rapper on the wrong side of the tracks. As the movie begins, we see him nervously preparing for a 'rap' battle in which contestants go onstage and disparage each other in their rapping. Jimmy chokes and is forced to leave the stage in disgrace. Among his interracial group of supporters, Future (Mekhi Phifer) is the one who sees real talent in Jimmy's rap and continues to push him.Kim Basinger plays Jimmy's mom, a woman who attaches her dreams to empty promises, alcohol, and bingo games. When Jimmy's fortunes take a downturn he is forced to return to the trailer where his mother lives with her live-in boyfriend and Jimmy's younger sister.If the movie were primarily about rap music, I probably would not have seen it. When I do listen to rap it is usually in my role as sociologist (as opposed to my role of music lover). I am not a fan of rap, particularly the misogynistic, homophobic form that Eminem is noted for. But the film is primarily about social conditions in America's abandoned cities and the inhabitants who are trapped and disenfranchised. While I am not a fan of Eminem the rapper (or for that matter, Eminem the person) I am now a fan of Eminem the actor. His performance is solid and has a stamp of authenticity that serves the film well. His work is enhanced by solid supporting performances from Phifer, Basinger, and Brittany Murphy. If you are interested in an engaging, slice-of-life film depicting the part of American society that most citizens ignore or avoid this is worth a look.If, however, your primary moral/aesthetic criteria for art involve the presence or absence of the big three (the big three being language, sex, and violence) be forewarned. Because the film depicts rap artists the coarse language is a given and it is pretty raw. The violence is minor compared to other similar films, but there are several scenes depicting sexual promiscuity here. The sexual promiscuity is used to reveal character (or lack thereof) and while graphic it is thematically redemptive in that it does show the negative consequences and shallowness of these fallen encounters. While the sexual encounters depicted are more graphic than viewers will see in the upcoming James Bond film, they are more positive precisely because they don't glorify the promiscuity as the Bond films do. In the end, this is a powerful film that goes beyond the cliches to give us an interesting depiction of urban America, but it is a rough ride. If you are easily offended by depictions of fallen humans in all of their brokenness, this film may just leave you shaken, not stirred.",8,1,1,2 July 2018
For Love of the Game," I Do Love The Game
","For Love of the Game is a film about Billy Chapel, an aging pitcher who may be pitching the last game, and perhaps the best game, of his career. This is happening on a day when he has discovered that the owner of his team is selling the team and the new owners want to trade him away. He has also discovered that his girlfriend of several years is leaving him to take a job in London. In short, at the beginning of the film, Billy Chapel is having a really bad day. Throughout the nine innings of the game that form the narrative core of the film, we experience various flashbacks that take us into the personal life of Billy Chapel.One of the things that must be said at the beginning is that For Love of the Game is derivative, formulaic, and filled with cliches. This need not be a fatal flaw. The same could be said of some of Shakespeare's best work (e.g., Romeo and Juliet). In fact, For Love of the Game provides Kevin Costner with his best starring role since Dances With Wolves. There must be something about baseballs. Two of Costner's better films from the past are Bull Durham and Field of Dreams. The basic role is similar to Costner's role in Bull Durham, the aging but wise team veteran. In its symbolic view of transcendent moments and meaningful relationships, For Love of the Game has more in common with Field of Dreams.The film is based on a novel by Michael Shaara. Shaara previously wrote the book that was the basis for the film Gettysburg ('Killer Angels'). The screenplay adaptation is by Dana Stevens whose previous writing credits include City of Angels. While it may seem like a weird combination for a baseball film, with Director Sam Raimi at the helm this film really works. One of the reasons it works is that, like Field of Dreams, this is not really a baseball film.This is a film about the human spirit and our longing for transcendence. Years ago, I played on a softball team in league competition. It's the bottom of the ninth, men on second and third, two outs, and I'm at the plate with a 3-0 count. I'm ready to take the walk. I was a pitcher, I knew the strike zone, and that year I was leading the league in walks taken. My older, and occasionally wiser, brother was our coach, and he pulled me aside and told me to go for it. I was batting .750 that year, and the guy behind me in the line-up was struggling. Frankly, I would have preferred the safe way out. Let the other guy take the heat for losing the game. Inspired by my brother's confidence in me, I swung at the next pitch, and hit a double to win the game. That was more than twenty years ago, but I remember that moment to this day, because it was someone else's confidence in me that gave me the courage to reach for the stars.In the final analysis, that's what this film is about. Baseball becomes the context, but the theme is the yearning of the human spirit for transcendence and meaning. What makes this film worth seeing is its emphasis on camaraderie and espirit-de-corps. In many films like this (e.g., The Natural) the hero finds his strength within and triumphs against the odds by superhuman effort. Billy Chapel's saving grace is his brokenness. It is his willingness to acknowledge his need for others that allows him to triumph in the end. While there are clearly elements borrowed from other films here, the final product is fresh, inspirational, and fun.",10,1,2,1 July 2018
The Insider," A story worth telling, a story well told
","It will come as no surprise to faithful readers of this column that I like good movies. I also like that even rarer event, the important movie. Rarest of all is that special movie that is both good and important. Michael Mann's The Insider is just such a film.Mann's best-known efforts to date are the films Heat and Last of the Mohicans. This film demands a more subtle and sophisticated guiding hand and Mann clearly rises to the challenge. The Insider is the somewhat fictionalized, but basically true, story of Jeffrey Wigand (played by Russell Crowe), a tobacco executive turned whistle blower. It is also the story of Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a passionate producer who becomes a whistle-blowing insider in his own right.The subject matter of the film places it in the tradition of films like Silkwood, The China Syndrome, and A Civil Action. When Wigand agrees to go on the record exposing the cover-ups and perjury by tobacco industry executives he is harassed, threatened, betrayed, and abandoned. The real story here though is how CBS was bullied into softening and burying the story. Pacino's performance as the passionate producer with integrity provides the moral center of the film.It should come as no surprise that this is a good film. In addition to Mann's capable direction, there are some excellent performances by Crowe (who viewers might remember as Bud White in LA Confidential) and Pacino. Christopher Plummer also does superior work in his less than flattering portrayal of Mike Wallace. The screenplay is adapted from a short story by one of the masters of adaptation, Eric Roth (Forrest Gump, The Horse Whisperer). Cinematographer Dante Spinotti uses color, light, and shadows to infuse the story with rich visual symbols. This is a good film by a team of gifted artists.But this is also an important film. It would be a mistake to see this film as simply a film about the tobacco industry or the co-optation of the news industry. Ultimately, it is about corporate power in its broadest sense. It was especially interesting watching this film on the weekend of the Microsoft monopoly ruling. The clear message of this film is that we all lose when the bottom line of corporate profits is our only moral compass. We live in a society desperately in need of prophetic critique and moral pronouncement. The Insider does not say all that needs to be said, but it provides a welcome start to a much-needed dialogue.",9,3,3,8 July 2018
Life Is Beautiful," Finding Beauty in the Midst of Horror
","Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful has reached rarefied heights in terms of critical acclaim. There are only a few times when a foreign-language film has been nominated for the Academy Award for best picture. It's been thirty years since a film was nominated for best picture and best foreign-language film. With its seven nominations (including actor, director, and screenplay) Life is Beautiful is one of the must-see films from last year's batch.The first half of the film is about a man in pursuit of love. Guido develops a severe case of love at first sight when he bumps into 'the princess' while traveling through the Italian countryside. Through humor and several carefully-arranged 'chance encounters', Guido manages to win the heart, and eventually the hand, of the woman he loves. Benigni's comedic acting is reminiscent of Chaplin in City Lights. The first half of the film is filled with wonderful humor and charming romance.The second half of the film jumps forward to the couple with their young son. Guido is trying to run a bookstore, but conditions are not conducive to success for Jewish businessmen in Italy during WWII. Guido and his son are taken to a concentration camp where Guido's primary concerns are being reunited with his wife and protecting his son from the brutality of life in the concentration camp. He does the latter by convincing his son that this is really all a game he arranged to celebrate the boy's birthday. If they follow the rules very carefully, they will make it to 1,000 points and win the grand prize.Benigni's acting and story development are very Chaplinesque in the second half, but here we are reminded of Chaplin with The Kid or the clowning Chaplin in The Great Dictator. Like Chaplin, Benigni has a gift for comedy mixed with pathos. Some have criticized the film for its use of humor in conjunction with the holocaust, but the film is not about the holocaust, it's about the human spirit and what holocaust survivor Vicktor Frankl called the 'will to meaning.' This film is a real gem. It will make you laugh, and it will make you cry, but most importantly perhaps, it will make you see how beautiful life really is, even in the darkest of circumstances.",9,0,0,5 July 2018
The Matrix," Take the Red Pill!
","Really good films often work on multiple levels. The best art is art that is profound enough to make us think, yet abstract enough to allow for multiple interpretations. The Wachowski brothers' film The Matrix does that and more.Keanu Reeves plays a computer whiz named Neo. When Neo starts getting messages from his computer, his life is turned upside down. A woman named Trinity contacts him because the great cyber-rebel Morpheus (Laurence Fisburne) is looking for him. When Morpheus and Neo finally meet, Morpheus explains that reality as we know it is a cyber-illusion. The 'machine' has taken over the world and is literally feeding on human energy, while the humans are oblivious having been placated by their virtueless virtual reality.One approach to this film is to see it as an excellent example of postmodern art and as an analyis of postmodern society. Our first clue to this interpretation is the book Neo hides things in-entitled Simulacra and Simulation. The concept of simulacra refers to the blurring of the line between reality and fiction-a copy for which there is no original. If we see The Matrix through this lens, the film becomes an interesting parable about modern society. This blurring of the line is a common theme these days (EDTV, Celebrity, Mad City, The Truman Show, Wag the Dog), and this film is an engaging addition to a growing body of work. Invite your favorite philosophy professor or social theorist and you can spend a few hours afterwards discussing phenomenology and the social construction of reality.At another level, we can approach The Matrix by analyzing 'the machine.' If you just got back from a weekend of training with the Michigan Militia, the machine can be seen as intrusive government that is manipulating the media to blind us to reality. For those of us who lean a bit left of center, the machine can be seen as the capitalist world system that exploits the poor, and ravages the impoverished nations of the earth, but keeps us plugged in by fantasies of the good life.For the less political, there are a number of religious and spiritual themes sprinkled throughout the movie. Morpheus and Neo end up looking a bit like John the Baptist and a Messiah figure respectively-including the proclamations by Morpheus that Neo is 'the one' (which is an anagram of Neo). In other scenes, Morpheus comes across like a New Age Zen master, or Yoda with an attitude.If all this work at multiple meanings makes your head hurt, the final alternative is to approach the film as a well-written action/adventure science-fiction film. There are some outstanding special effects and some interesting action scenes. In the end, it is the complexity of the multidimensional story that makes this movie work. A definite thumbs up for one of the more interesting stories so far this year.",10,0,1,6 July 2018
Hart's War," The Heart of Heart's War
","I have to confess that one of the main reasons I was anxious to see Hart's War was because I was in the Czech Republic when it was being filmed there. I had hoped for glorious images of the beautiful countryside that I had seen last May. Because the majority of the film takes place in a POW camp (therefore a studio set) there is very little of the Czech landscape to be seen in this film. The film does offer a view of the American landscape from the not-so-distant past by focusing on racial conflict among U.S. military personnel during World War II.I had expected a film in the tradition of Stalag 17 or The Great Escape. While there are elements of these films here, the heart of the film is closer to A Soldier's Story or Men of Honor. The film actually weaves together several different stories and is part hero's quest, part racial conflict, part courtroom drama, and part POW film. It is to the credit of director Gregory Hoblit (not Hobbit-different film) that the different threads come together reasonably well.Initially, the film is about Captain Hart (Colin Farrell) and the circumstances surrounding his arrival at the POW camp. Because of a conflict with the senior officer (Bruce Willis) among the POW's, he is placed in a barracks with the enlisted men. He is just getting to know them and win their trust when two more officers are placed in the barracks-two black pilots who are part of the Tuskegee Airmen. The other enlisted men resent their presence there and the racial tension results in a betrayal, a murder, and ultimately the framing of an innocent man.At the heart of the film is the irony of the U.S. involvement in fighting the evil perpetrators of the holocaust while tolerating 'ethnic cleansing' at home in the U.S. In one of the more powerful scenes, one of the black officers tells the story of watching German POW's in the US being escorted into movie theaters where blacks were not allowed-not even blacks training to be Tuskegee airmen.The acting in the film was very good and the visual elements were solid. The Rachel Portman score added just the right touches at just the right times. There are points where the drama is a bit contrived, and I have mixed feelings about the twists and turns at the end of the film. On the whole, however, if your only other options are a seventh viewing of Lord of the Rings, yet another thoughtless shoot-em-up, or Britney Spears in her screen debut, Hart's War is definitely worth a look.",9,0,4,3 July 2018
