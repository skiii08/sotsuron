Come and See," Come and See. I regret I did!!!
","Unfortunatily, though I wanted to, i did not find this film interesting. Come and See is an extremely cereal film to watch. If before watching the film,I had not bothered to read the sub text. I may not have know what the story was about. For the viewers who have little knowledge about the Eastern front in the early 1940's,it could be confusing to watch with no understanding of the concept of the story.Quick over view, for the people who haven't seen the film. Come and See' is based on experiences witnessed by citizens in Eastern Europe during the German Invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 . Their treatment, mostly the work of the SS, towards the citizens of these countries were barbaric. Countless men,woman and children were raped,beaten,shot and slaughtered in one of the biggest act of Genocide in history. Come and See is set in Byelorussia around 1942-1943. The film is told from a young Byelorussian boys view named, Florya who joins the local partisans against the German invaders. We see him go through the film in an unconscious state of mind.The problem with the film is that we get to know little about Florya,we don't learn anything about who the characters are and why they are there. The film is very slow and at many times throughout, nothing much is happening. The one good set piece that as any little visual effect showing the horror, at bested a film can, that these people went through comes right at the end. Like the massacre of Florya's family ,which you don't see, it could have been better done.The film as a whole could have been so much better. The long, ringing in your ears, muted sound is off putting and not effective.This film gets three stars from me for the reason of 1. The trees exploding scenes (around 20 seconds each) are visual stunning as well as 2. The bullets travelling at speed and glowing up the air, (also around 20 second). 3. For bringing to screen, a story from a group of partisans in Eastern Europe view and for the last 15 minutes of the film.Come and See is not a total disaster of a film. It is well filmed by the director Elem Klimov and does,though very loosely, tell us about the experience of the partisans during the war. However their are NO set battle scenes, hardly a shot is fired, their is only one massacre scene at the end, and most disappointing of all the film is very SLOW.",3,15,73,27 September 2007
The Killing Fields," Darkness of the soul
","Set in the former French colony of Indochina, The Killing Fields centres on New York Times correspondent Sydney Schanberg, together with fellow journalistic aid and Cambodian national Dith Pran reporting on the military involvement of the United States in South East Asia in the early 1970s, Significantly, and the films main focal point, commentating on the latter stages of the Cambodian civil war. Due to the close proximity to Vietnam, and the United States wearisome involvement in the on-going communist and democratic conflicts in South East Asia, American foreign policy and public interest paid portentous attentiveness to the affairs of Cambodia.The film is introduced at the time of America's covert aerial bombardment of Eastern Cambodian military targets following the communist guerrillas refusal to adhere to the 1973 Paris Peace Treaty. Zealous journalist Schanberg is eager to and hindered from reporting to the American public the trepidation caused by the American bombing. Succeeding this introduction, the film moves intensely to the 1975 evacuation of foreign nationals from Phnom Penh during the seizing of power by the totalitarian communists Kampuchea before focusing on the consequent killing fields caused through social transformation and the year-zero policy. The film's final act, following a left behind Pran's escape from a national forced labour camp, is the eventual reuniting of the two journalist friends. From one stand point, British director Ronald Joffe does not shy away from exposing the human atrocities caused by armed conflict. Yet, Joffe does not over-embellish the horrors that inhabitant's encounter in a war-torn Country. Particularly, The Killing Fields centrepiece is the acts of humanity both moral, relationship between close friends, and immoral, the killing of innocent civilians and possible to a lesser extent, the unintentional minor selfish betrayal of Schanberg towards Pran. Rather than taking a more dramatic conventional route, the films interesting aspect is to view from a pragmatic everyday journalistic media approach. Also, interestingly The Killing Fields is one of a handful of English language films to call attention the violence, economics and political ideologies of twentieth-century revolutions. The horrors of the Khmer Rouge and the story told in The killing Fields draws parallels with events in the 1930's collectivisation of Ukrainian agriculture, the Nazi Holocaust of World War II and Mao's Great Leap Forward in the 1950's, all of which resulted in systematic extermination.Unfortunately I was unable to view the film in anamorphic widescreen 1.78:1 format. Although not as detailed, viewing the film in standard format did not eradicate the intensity of the film. As well as a story of friendship, The Killing Fields is an exceptional example of a former colonial countries dilemma when faced with dissimilar political ideologies following independence. Furthermore, the indescribable torment citizens' encounter in a brutal civil war and the mass suffering during the course of inhumane social experiments and the forced undemocratic reorganising of a society.",7,0,0,16 May 2013
Pearl Harbor," not the right subject for 'Titanic type story telling.
","Question?what do you get with a combination of Jerry Bruckheiner,$150million budget and a screenplay based on one of the most important historical events in modern history,Ansewer,a complete mess.Micheal bay's reconstruction of the infamous attack by the Japanese air-force on the American pacific fleet based at Pearl harbor in December 1941 is 30 minute's worth of impressive film making which looks spectacular on screen ,Its just the other 130 minutes of 'Pearl harbor' that is a complete load of rubbish. The film tries to pack to many subjects into one movie and in the end this is it's downfall.What you get is a war film,buddy movie,love story,biographical account of historical people and events,defeat and victory all mixed in to a 3 hour film that should of been only 2. The prolonged sickerly-sweet love triangle and the doolittle raid were totally unnecessary given the most crucial aspect of the film was the attack on Pearl itself,And if the director had had concentrated on that subject alone instead of going down the 'Titanic' route of story telling (love story set against a sombre theme)it could of turned out so much better.The set pieces are effective and use the aid of modern digital technology to it's advantage,Bringing the aerial sequence's to life which are thoroughly eye catching.Though sum of these scenes are spoilled by the gung-ho American approach.Points being the young USAF pilot being inexperienced in the field of air combat but able to jump straight into a spitfire and take on the Luftwaffe and later Japanese zero's,But where supposed not to notice that. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the script and the wooden acting.Ben Affeck and Josh Harnett give it their best as Raffe and Danny but are not convincing enough in the period characters they are playing,Kate Beckinsale's character Everlyn gives you the impression that she would open her legs for any serviceman with a little bit of charming and Ewen Brenner's stuttering character is just annoying,As for Cuba Gooding jnr's take of Dorris Miller, that is the worst and not done to the right effect. That said there are some creditable performance's from Jon voight as FD Roosevelt and Alec Baldwin does a good job playing Lt col Doolittle.But these roles are lost among a weak scripted.The film tries and fail's in bits to tell the story of WHY and HOW the Japanese planned and then attacked Pearl harbor from a Japanese point of view,Unfortunately their isn't enough of an explanation of why,just they refuse(the US) to give us vital oil,and the how is a very quick bunch of scene's and not explained with enough focus on the actual event,the director's to anxious to get back to the love story and blowing ship's up.THEN THE MOVIE TAKE'S A ON AN UNNECESSARY THIRD ACT.After the humiliating defeat by the 'Jap's' at Pearl harbor it's time for the Americans to kick some ass,This is achieved by the Doolittle raid on Tokyo which is historically accurate but the timing of it is not ,Or the film gives you that impression! The Doolittle raid tuck place around the middle of 1942 after which time the imperial Japanese had occupied much of south east Asia including American territory(the film fails to tell you this). And this is how the film ends with Raffe and Danny crashed landed in China after the Tokyo raid.(what about the US pilots captured over Tokyo,which also doesn't get a mention in the film).I do like the bit where during the Pearl harbor attack Danny say's the line 'world war two as just started' to inform everyone as to why there being blown to bits,I wounder what the British,French,Canadian and Russian force's would of made of this belated observation by the young American. To sum all this up i would say the film is a embarrassment and insult to the veterans on both side's(OK the Japanese were no angels)but the American's never fought back at Pearl harbor the way it is shown in this film .If your looking for an account of the events in the pacific field of combat during 1941 try watching 'Tora Tora tora'.If your offeneded by the good ole American view of the war'(what defeats)'then i recommended you stair clear.",3,0,1,2 March 2006
Saving Private Ryan," Best war film since 'Platoon'
","As well as praise,this film also received a lot of criticism at the time of it's release because of it's pro-American view.so what... This IS an American financed film,made BY American's,FOR American audience's with American actor's and the beach landing on Omagh were done BY American servicemen. I can't see why SPR should be snubbed at because of this,It wasn't the first and won't be the last war film to be made from an American point of view.'Saving private Ryan' is an excellent war film and deserve's it's billing as one of the top 10 war movie of all time.The opening Omagh beach landing scene's are horrifically realistic,showing the viewer as best a film can what it must of been like for those men on that fatal morning in June 1944. When them landing craft ramps went down all hell broke loss and the US Rangers were just cannon fodder for the German's up above in their machine gun bunker's. A lot as been said about the miss-leading of the Normandy beach landing scene in the beginning of SPR,Some Viewer's of the film say that the overload operation lead by the British,Canadian AND American's were not as blood thirsty as has portrayed in this film. Yes this true,It is a fact that only 1 out of every 7 allied soldiers actually fired a weapon on D-Day. But Omagh was as chilling as it is seen in SPR.After the first 30 minutes of one of the most graphically violent battle scenes ever witnessed on screen the film moves onto it it's main story.8 soldiers lead by capt Miller on a mission to find a private in the 101st airborne division lost somewhere in Normandy so that he can return him home to his mother after the US top brass as learned that three of her sons have just been killed in combat.A bit of a PR mission so to say. Through the mission the GI's tell us of their views of the war and the mission they are on(whats the point of risking eight lives to save one?) Some are killed in combat along the way as they meet German opposition raising the pointless of the mission with anger among the men.Till they eventually find pvt Ryan who as hooked up with another platoon that are defending a bridge that the Germans want for their counter attack.All this lead's to a grand finale battle between the American GI's and the battle hardened waffen SS inside a bombed out Normandy village.The battle scenes in SPR are authentic enough ,first on Omagh after a pinned down onslaught the rangers make easy pray of the German troops,This is because the German regiment's along the Normandy coast were mainly made up of eastern European conscripts captured from German occupied territory in the east and forced to fight by the Nazi's in German divisions.Hitler thought the main landing zone for the allies would most likely be Calias.So the front line worriment were stationed there. But in the final battle scene in this film the GI's faced much more resilient opposition in the form of the SS who we see give the American's a real fight.(The GI's are only saved from being wiped by the SS thanks to an air attack on the German line by P51's)All in all 'saving private Ryan' is an excellent movie if you like bloody all out war battle scene's.The director Steven Spielberg brings the killing scenes right up close to the camera.The script is OK but can be a bit sentimentally at time's(trying to reason war through the eye's of Spielberg..in dialogue from the characters by the way)but this isn't enough of a problem to spoil the film.",10,1,2,5 March 2006
The Football Factory," The story is boring,the acting is rubbish and the plot is all over the place.
","I decided to rent this film out on DVD and by the end of viewing wished I hadn't bothered. The story is boring,the acting is rubbish and the story is disjointed. The lead character is a lad in his late twenties called Tommy who through narration tells us his points of view on life and how he lives it. Life, which include fighting football hooligans, drinking alcohol with his mates and getting laid. The odd thing is you never actually see him hit anybody and he never has sex throughout the movie. This juvenile attitude continues on and through to the main basis of the film which is a scrap between Chelsea and Milwall fans. Other subjects added into the plot are lots of drug taking(even by pensioners)robbing of peoples homes and confusing a psychic predictions of the future. All of this with sentences that start and end with the words f**k and c**t. I was bewildered by the bits where Tommy and his hooligan friends are on their way to a football match in Liverpool. They first stop on a road in the middle of nowhere, presumable Liverpool, scream and shout at some locals, then their back on the motorway and stopping at a service station?? How big is this Liverpool. And why after being arrested at a service station up north somewhere they are tried at a court in London?? The filmmakers have embarrassingly ripped off scenes from other movies including Goodfellas, American history X and Ttrainspotting. The main psycho hard man of the film is just a fat slob who after throwing a couple of punchers would probable have a heart attack,Tommys best mate Rod is simple and dull,the rest of the characters bring nothing to the story of how and why they are their.I found this movie just a load of juvenile nonsense from start to finish ,If your looking for really scenes of bruising football violence with a plot you wont find it in The football factory.",3,11,23,7 February 2006
Stalingrad," Non-glorification of war
","During the second world war, one city on the banks of the Volga become the symbol of adversary for many nations ensnared in conflict. For the Nazi supremacy the City of Stalingrad represented the doctrines of Bolshevism. For the Soviet Union, Stalingrad represented national loyalty, patriotism and the defence of the whole country. Subsequently, for many generations, the battle of Stalingrad carries an extensive mark of lasting psychological suffering. Most notable, the German nation. Its a striking occurrence that since Germany was unified in 1989, the first moderate budget war film produced centred on this battle in 1942.The film-makers have skilfully chronologically crafted and edited the film in several ways. To begin with, the scenes of the Warmacht relaxing in North West Italy following combat in North Africa, which resulted in them pushing back the British, Australian, New Zealand and Free-French armies. This method allows the audience a sense of calm opposing expectations before the troops are relocated to Southern Russia. During relocation, we witness the feeling of confidence instilled into the minds of the Warmacht and their future plans for Russia, once conquered. However, on arrival In Stalingrad the first images witnessed are of severely wounded and unresponsive soldiers (the ones they have been sent to replace), Russian prisoners of war being brutally mistreated and close combat soon follows. You can scene the atmosphere and their thoughts, what fate awaits them? 'Stalingrad' succeeds in a series of scenes containing humanity-combat-brutality-morality-back to combat. The majority of these different scenes, binded together story-wise, accomplish a purpose and question the obligation of the war. Yet, some scenes are over dramatised and amiably over-tender, especially the third and final act.The director, Joseph Vilsmaier resourcefully adopts a hand-held camera method for many of the combat scenes. This method helps heighten the impending danger. Also, many combat injuries are graphical in detail. Both methods that are now so common in many modern Hollywood war films of the past 15 years, post 'Saving Private Ryan'. The film makes the subtle conformity that is was the harsh Russian winter, lack of supplies and the deficient judgement of their high-ranking officers that defeated them.It appears the film makers are indicatively expressing the story of the war, not just the battle of Stalingrad, in this film. The rise and fall of the Warmacht, from victory to defeat, and eventually the spirit of the German nation. A principle that sub-consciously last to this day. Not that this should be misinterpreted as passing judgement on the film-makers or the German nationals, it is just a slender observation.Overall, 'Stalingrad' is not a documentary of the titles battle, it is film, and a very virtuous one, made for dramatic presentation. The acting is good from all the cast involved, especially, Thomas Kretschmann and Dominique Horwitz as Warmacht soldiers. The production design is realistic and visionary decisive. The combat scenes express savagery and the film contains a image of sombre quality focusing on sacrifices and human interaction of a sensitive issue.",7,2,3,14 May 2011
Enemy at the Gates," A very good war film set in a battle not familiar with many people.
","In the of winter 1942 inside a Russian city called Stalingrad the biggest land battle of history was taking place,This is the setting for the film 'Enamy at the gates'.'Enemy at the gates'tells the story of a young freshly enlisted red army solider called Vasili Zaitsev played by Jude Law. From the start we follow the young Russian's journey across southern Russia to the burned out city of Stalingrad,now partly occuiped by the advancing German army wanting to take over Russia.There awaiting him and his fellow comrades are red army officers eager to get him killed on one side and the German army on the other lying in wait to kill him,(These poor lad's didn't stand a chance!).As it turns out Vasili is a crack shot with a rifle and with the help of his new found friend Danilov who is a army political officer Vasili is transfered to snipper division and his name and how many German officers he pick's off day by day is printed then expanded throughout Russia for propaganda purposes.Danilov play's Zaitsev up as a national hero bringing some much needed hope into the heart's of the Russian people.Understandably the German high command are a bit p*s*ed off with this young talented Russian and his snipper division picking off their officers so they decided to send in their own crack shot a man by the name of major Konig to hunt and kill Vasili and his snipper platoon. So what we get is a cat and mouse chase through a devastated Stalingrad.In this nightmare setting Vasili falls in love and vis-versa with a young female solider callled Tania played by Rachel Weisz,concurrently so does Danilov which cause's tension between the boy's,Danilov wanting Vasili out of the way sends him on more and more suicide mission's ,All this lead to a grand finale between Zaitsev and Konig. The battle scene's are very gritty and authentic plus they are shown true to the battle as a no win situation's for both side's.The director use's lots of close up shots in the duals between the snippers capturing the tension and nerve that is with them as they lie in wait for the next kill,Theirs an excellent scene in the film were the snippers are trapped in a building under target from each other and at the same trying to survive a aerial bombardment from the German bombers. The cast which unglued Ed Harris as Major Konig,Josegh Fiennes as Danilov and a very resembling with the help of make-up Bob Hoskins as Nikita Khrushev.All of them including Jude,Rachel and the support cast give applauseable poformance's in their role's and bring the characters to life.This is a well made picture and a breath of fresh air to audience's in the west used to seeing WW2 movie from an American or British point of view,Although it doesn't totally capture the true horror of what the Germans and Russians went through in the east(no film could)it does a pretty decent job never the less and credit must go to the film makers and film company for being brave enough to make and finance a war movie(including a love story as well)that doesn't involve the US marine's.",7,1,2,3 March 2006
Downfall," Superb
","Not since the 1981 release of 'Das Boot' has a German film had such an impact on audiences witnessing, from a German point of view, the perception, judgement,interpretation and opinion on its own history. 'Downfall' tells the true story of the last days of the third Reich (April 1945), from within Hitlers secret underground bunker situated in the heart of Berlin. 3/4 of the film is set inside the scope of the claustrophobic and confined concrete bunker world of Adolf Hitler during his last weeks alive. The film also show a glimpse of central Berlin in its besieged and confused state during the Soviet onslaught. Inside the bunker we see Hitler's decay, he goes from calmness to rage, from understanding to paranoia, from irrational to total deluded. He gives his generals and field commandos ( there was no grand admirals present in the bunker at this time of the war) orders that are not compatible with reality or fact. He tries to control armies that do not exist anymore or order companies to counter-attack that only featuring on a map. A large majority of his high ranking commanding officers sense, and have done for 8-months, the war is lost on the side of Germany. However, some still believe in final victory in idealistic faculties. This is played out on screen with nervous tension. In addition, the few scenes set outside the bunker bring across a population confused, scarred, exhausted. Some however are continuing to display courage in valiantly defending the city and show continuously hopeless resistance in the face of the advancing red army (1st Belarussian army)bought on by years of Nazi propaganda.The film magnificently achieves to bring to screen the combination of Traudi Junges ( Hitlers private secretary) memoirs, Nazi officials memoirs, German war archives and the documentary 'blind spot' to a conclusion on screen.Bruno Ganz brings the fuhrer to life in his exceptionally good performance. Alexandria Maria Lara plays the role of Traudi Junge has a young confused,aroused and obsolete to the truth citizen of the third Reich. All the members of the cast gives excellently rehearsed and researched performances to life. Ulrich Noether was a perfect likeness to Himmler.'Downfall' is a remarkable history lesson on the second world war in Europe. It holds the attention of the audience through out. The film never side tracking away for long enough, in which it sets the sense of calmness, peace and normality, to lose sight of the unbearable reality of the situation.",10,5,7,17 September 2008
