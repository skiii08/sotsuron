Blade Runner 2049," Gee it took them a long time to waste this opportunity.
","You know it's a bad movie when you start wondering how long you've been watching it. That doesn't mean that it's terrible, I'm sure there's a decent movie in this dragged out mess. There are some intriguing ideas, some well thought out conundrums but everything gets lost in overly long, drawn out scenes that add nothing. I would wager that nearly every scene could have been trimmed by at least four minutes and the movie would've actually worked. This movie is a prime example of lost talent. Everyone from the top down probably thought that they were creating something epic and meaningful and forgot that it should be slightly entertaining. It's a dystopia, we get it. It's a story of morality, we get it. Now move the freaking story along. About a third of the way through this snoozefest, I turned to my friend and said 'I don't care about any of these characters.' Two thirds of the way through I said 'Is this still on?' which was soon followed by 'Why is this still on?' and, inevitably, 'When will this thing end?'If you're waiting to see this film, wait a little longer for the 'Not the Director's Cut' or the 'Abridged so it's Watchable' version. Or, if you're feeling nostalgic, just watch the original which has a sense of pacing. This sequel is only destined to be a classic lesson on hubris and delusions of self-importance.",3,9,17,20 February 2018
Finding Nemo," Visually stunning and occasionally entertaining
","Pixar threw every dollar they had into the look of this film, it's too bad they didn't hire a writer. Still, it's a good flick to throw on when you want to zombify your children although I suspect anyone over the age of six will end up screaming 'we get the point, already!' at the television. The cast is good, often doing amazing things with the drek they were given to read. I suspect the writers ran out of material somewhere around the sixty minute mark, after that they just keep repeating the same line over and over and over and over and over and over and over...If you're over the age of eight then Finding Nemo makes a better screensaver than film.",5,2,4,25 December 2004
Terminator Salvation," Fanally, a movie to make me feel better about T3!
","Okay, let me preface this by saying 3 things. 1) I'm not a rabid fanboy that thinks this series is epic in any way. 2) I'm not a hater of science fiction, even bad science fiction. 3) I don't think that you can add a spoiler to something that's already spoilt. That being said, there won't be any spoilers here just because I don't care enough about this movie to really go in any sort of depth. So why am I writing this? Maybe it's to gently remind people that this is a movie about killer-robots from the future. It's not art, folks. It's not the epic statement of humanity in our time. Where this movie fails, is that it's completely forgotten it's roots. The first 3 movies in the series didn't take themselves too seriously. At least the first and third didn't. The second one was practically pompous by comparison. Still, Terminator 2 was still somewhat aware that it was a science fiction film wrapped around a chase scene. That's where the excitement and fun came from. There was also a lighter side. The suspense was tempered by a self deprecating sense of humour. That's where Terminator Salvation fails.Terminator Salvation is a movie that forgets it's roots. All of them. The chase sequences are tired, there is no humour, there is no self awareness. Instead we're given bleak. It's almost as if director McG sought out new sources of bleak to throw in as a substitution for depth. There's nothing to frighten, or challenge or even lightly amuse the audience here, only dirt, sludge, grime and stern looks. Christian Bale truly shows his range as an actor. He has none. He glowers, glares, and gives us vacant grimaces as he tries his best to look like a killbot from the future. I'm guessing no one told him he wasn't playing the terminator. It's a tragic thing when you're out acted by a killbot.The special effects aren't anything we haven't seen before. The plot is really little more than a chase across some landscape which, I may point out, was done better in the previous 3 movies of this franchise. The characters don't really need names, you won't remember them anyway. The direction and writing go from lazy to comatose and it's really difficult to say anything positive about this straight-to-video theatre release. If this is the salvation of mankind then bring on Judgement Day.",1,3,6,12 December 2011
Suicide Squad," A Worthy Rival to Catwoman
","This wannabe blockbuster will leave you feeling pretty neutral. They do the most boring thing possible to introduce the characters, they give you small flashbacks and talk about them all to typically clich√© ridden rock songs. The end result? you really don't care about any of them. They're supposed to be bad guys but the worst you see them do is steal a purse. Strangely, that was one of the highlights of the film. So the story can pretty much be summed up in 10 words: Criminals are let out of prison to stop a villain. There, I just saved you $15. 90% of the cast is disposable, they fight some terribly rendered, faceless lump heads then fight some guy that I swear was in Tron from the 80's. There's really not much to say about the film because that's pretty much it. While sitting through the first half hour of introductions and talking I had to lean over to the person next to me and ask if I'd missed the six more interesting movies that should've preceded this hot mess. No, she replied. It's too bad, some of them looked like they may be slightly more interesting than what I was watching. There was really nothing remarkable about this piece of fluff. It seems to be designed for 14-year- old boys who haven't ever read an actual book or seen any decent films. At one point in the movie they actually gave us a flashback of an event that happened only 20-minutes earlier, and not to introduce new information but to just reiterate something that was bad enough viewing once. At the end of the movie, I felt more intrigued by the buttons that moved my seat back and forth than by anything I'd seen. Hopefully this will end the vacuous reign of Zac Snyder and comic book movies. If it doesn't, then maybe they just need to hear that comic book movies are only a step above video game movies. Give us a story that doesn't rely on the protagonists standing around the bad guy in a rough circle while hitting them.",4,3,6,10 August 2016
Watchmen," Watchmen? Watch people.
","First thing I want to say is that I usually cut movies made from comic books a lot of slack. That's usually because the source material is pretty thin and filled with archetypes and lazy writing. I'd also like to point out that the last comic book I'd seriously read was when I was eleven so the genre may have changed (although recent peeks into ones I've found in barber shops haven't really supported this). So I have never read Watchmen and likely won't in the future.When I started watching the film, though, I was impressed. The characters were fleshed out, the alternate past was thoughtfully developed and the story kept me guessing exactly who the villain was. Not being a fan of the comic book also left me the joy of learning who the heroes were, as well. I found their motivations to be intriguing and their super-powers, thankfully, understated.The film has, at it's core, a murder mystery which launches the characters into action towards a climax that is both unexpected and satisfying. You find yourself caring about the characters because they are flawed and, in many cases, middle-aged and struck with adult problems. This isn't a story about a teen hero learning the complexities of adult life - like the Spiderman series, nor is it a story filled with artificial darkness and unrealistic angst like the current Batman revival (yes, Bruce, your parents were murdered. get some counseling already, you can afford it), instead it's a story where adults are dealing with the decisions and actions of their lives.Watchmen is surprisingly complex and well thought out. I can only hope it attracts a mature audience because only they would truly appreciate the subtleties in the story. That being said, on to the special effects.In one word, beautiful. They're not overstated because they don't need to be. You're delivered rich colour palettes and a chance to actually enjoy them. Unlike the Transformer series, which prefers to sacrifice a good view of the action for meaningless close-ups of dust and machine parts, Watchmen lets you savour the scene. You get to see everything in stunning detail.The most visually striking characters are the tormented Rorschach and the god-like Dr. Manhattan. In many ways, the characters are foils of each other. Rorschach, always masked, dark and simmering and Manhattan glowing cold blue and often naked. They provide two contrasting points of view. One wrapped in grit seeing only the worst around him while the other seemingly exposing everything about himself in a selfless drive to better the planet. But, like nearly everything in this film, this is an illusion. Manhattan and Rorschach prove to be the most complex characters in the film.I won't say anything more about Watchmen other than I hope no one ever tries to make a sequel, it's too much of a joy to experience on it's own. There really is only one champagne - a sequel would just be another sparkling white wine. Instead, I'll just say if you're going to watch one superhero comic book adaptation this year then make it Watchmen.",8,0,3,9 July 2009
Die Hard 2," Die Hardish
","This has got to be one of the worst written pieces of crap ever put to celluloid. That being said, if you don't enjoy seeing it, repeatedly, you're probably already dead. I'm still amazed that this was based on a book, like an actual book and not on a comic or a fortune cookie or even a corporate logo printed on a paper napkin.Let's take a closer look and, although there are spoilers they'll only lead to the enjoyment of this exercise in absurdity. The first thing I noticed is Bruce Willis seems to get the same little cut above his right eyebrow as he got in the first movie. I know, nit picking, but it's almost like a studio found that the eyebrow injury tested well among audiences. Okay, so that was a little bit of a minor thing compared to things like grenades with the longest fuse, ever or the completely gratuitous nude scene from our villain with the perfectly sculpted posterior, but it sort of gives you an inkling of where I'm heading here. If you look too closely at this film, it'll drive you mad. They put so much detail into this film and most of it is pure nonsense. In it, you get Colm Meany and Patrick O'Neal speaking to each other in fake accents for absolutely no reason whatsoever. You'll see a hole in a windshield just to remind you that there's a hole in a windshield. You'll have someone describe the hole in the windshield although it'll really have no impact on the plot other than there being said hole in said windshield. You'll watch airplanes land on runways covered with debris from other airplanes... wait, I'm just going to stop there because there are way too many plot holes, mistakes, goofs or just plain nonsense in this film that it makes Transformers look like a documentary.At the end of it, you just won't care. It has some magical ability to just make all the nonsense go away and leave you rooting for the indestructible John Mclean and his plucky band of sidekicks. Watch this movie, you'll enjoy it more than it deserves.",7,1,2,11 December 2016
Avengers: Endgame," Mediocre and dull
","The film begins with the aftereffects of the culling by bad guy Thanos. That's where everything starts to go wrong. According to the story, half of all life disappears in the universe. I can't speak for the universe, but I can speak for Earth when I say this is seriously overblown.Being Gen-X, I actually remember a time when the population of the planet was at 3.4 billion people. It was 1971. One of the big problems that faced us was... wait for it... overpopulation. Still, with that many people we managed to send people to the moon, create things and still, somehow, survive. All that would happen would be a drastic reduction in real estate prices, a surplus of goods and the Earth would get around four decades of time to stop the train wreck of climate change. In the Avenger Endgame, people prefer to mope and everyone has forgotten how to clean things.Instead, the Avengers get weepy. They decide to 'fix' things through time travel. This is, believe it or not, the highlight of the film. Once they accomplish their 'time heist' the punching begins. Then the punching continues. Then it's followed by more punching. More Avengers join in the punching. Much CGI nonsense follows. Capitan America gets a scrape on his face, the only part of him that seems susceptible to damage. Everyone carries the magic glove around while, yes, more punching follows.Finally, when they run out of punches, Iron Man snaps his fingers and it all stops. Tears are shed and the viewer is left asking why this mess couldn't take about two hours less than it did. Overall, I give it a seven for the time travel, take away three for the endless punch fest and two more for the fact that the whole thing is stupid-absurd. It's a great film to watch on a plane where you can skip through most of it.",3,32,49,23 October 2019
The Mist," Should've called it The Missed
","Stephen King must really have run out of ideas. The Mist could have made a nice hour of television rather than a full movie. The dialogue was stilted and way over the top, the acting was more wooden than the store shelves. Personally I found it so hard to connect with any of the characters that I had to look at the DVD box for their names and even then I didn't care.Let me sum up the plot for you if you're considering wasting your time or money on this thing.Man with dubious relationship to wife and child goes shopping the day after a storm. Fog rolls in and death comes with it. Something with tentacles eats the world's dumbest bag-boy and five-minutes later anarchy and religion break out. A couple of deaths later and a brave group heads into the mist in a 4x4. They drive for about five more minutes before they run out of gas and off themselves - mostly.The film isn't a total loss, the monsters look creepy enough and the mist is scary in it's ominous fogginess but there really isn't a lot here to keep your attention. The characters are little more than shadows of archetypes who stray so far from the obvious that a GPS and a trail of crumbs couldn't lead them back to reason.If you truly want to see a masterful work of tentacled horror then rent Tremors. No stupid fog, no ridiculous alternate-reality, no insipid actors mouthing lines that put even them asleep.",5,0,1,29 March 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Don't bother with the cinema
","A good movie to see if you're stuck on a plane crossing an ocean and you're bored with the Skymall magazine or if you're sick at home with a high temperature and poor judgement. The first movie I'd recommend watching on your phone, you won't miss anything. It's a perfect movie for those who love to waste more of their lives watching another Batman origin story because every superhero fan wants to see that, again. It's been said that if you took every Batman origin story ever made and connected them together you'd have a piece of film long enough to go from the Earth to Pluto and still be bored to tears. And the dream sequences, wow, can't get enough dream sequences said no one, ever. So if you like to watch 3 hours of trailers for other movies, but are afraid of things like story development, the use of colours, coherence, then this could be the movie for you Just think of it as a crappy version of Suckerpunch - no, really, it can get worse than Suckerpunch! Zack Snyder has triumphed in his ability to waste millions and present nothing but a whole bunch of global warming. I'd feel better if the cast and crew planted a couple trees to offset the carbon debt created in making this disaster. He's like a modern day Dino Delaurentis but without the substance or talent.At the end of the day, if you're a 14-year-old boy, or just never matured beyond that point, spend your allowance on this. You'll like it just as much as the technology that makes everything look like a talking vagina from Man of Steel.",2,2,8,31 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It wasn't that bad
","So I packed my husband into the theatre and ourselves and nine other people settled in to watch Star Wars, The Force Awakens. Okay, I have to admit, I wasn't thrilled with the opening scrawl that seemed written by a high school drama club but, believe it or not, things improved from there. After reading all the spoilers about the film, which I truly don't care about, I wasn't expecting much from this, the seventh outing of this franchise. To be honest, it wasn't that bad.The newcomers Rey and Finn were great. They were well written (as well written as anyone's been in this series) and well acted. Poe, the fighter pilot that was thrown from his ship minus his jacket (explain that one to me) seemed to be little more than a role designed for an action figure as did the rather pointless Phasma. They really didn't need names. Darth Wannabe, who's name I forgot, actually wasn't bad. I liked his confusion. Han Solo and General Leia did what they could with what they were given. BB8, the robot companion of the fighter pilot out acted the previously mentioned Phasma and provided some comic relief. Now for the bad. The spaceships looked tiny, and I don't mean tiny compared to the vastness of space I mean tiny. The tie fighters and x-wings looked good as full-sized props next to actors but in the battle scenes they looked like dinky toys. Same with the Millennium Falcon and the Star Destroyers. Nothing looked big enough for a human to fit into. The sense of scale was amiss. I don't know if the camera's were set to Tilt-shift or if it was just really, really bad modelling but everything just looked small. I felt like I was watching a toy commercial on a cell phone.I was also disappointed that in the 30-years since the last movie, technology has pretty much stood still in this fantasy universe. The rebel fleet has gone from huge capital ships, x-wings, a- wings, b-wings and y-wings to about 12 x-wings. Remember, this is the side that won the war. Meanwhile, the Empire (which is now the Order-66 or something) has gone from giant star destroyers, super-star destroyers, tie fighters, bombers, interceptors to what look like sub- compact star destroyers and tie fighters. the only thing they did that was slightly different was they made a Death Star but this time it was a planet made into a Death Star (That's no space station, that's a moon?). It was cool enough but nothing we haven't seen before.Actually, that's my biggest complaint. There was so little that we hadn't seen before. Stormtroopers still wear the worst armour in the universe (why do they even bother with that stuff?), everyone still flies the same four spaceships, and the plot is just a rehash of the third movie which was a rehash of the first and second. I could nitpick details but why bother. This is a space fantasy movie and to enjoy it means you don't think about it too critically. It whiles away the time on a dreary winter day and it shouldn't have to do much more than that. In the next outing, Star Wars 8, Order-66 Strikes Back, I just hope we see a little more variety and maybe a better sense of scale. On the plus side, the otherwise useless 3-d did provide two bits of fun. One was when one of the smallish Star Destroyers (Star Denters?) hangs in front of the audience. The other was when Rey holds out a lightsaber. I was glad I wasn't the only one out of the eleven people in the audience who reached out to take it.",7,5,38,25 January 2016
