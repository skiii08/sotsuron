The Avengers," They made the HULK into a monkey?!!!
","First of all i'd like to say there really aren't any spoilers because there really isn't a story! It's all eye candy and if there were spoilers i wouldn't mention them here. The hulk in this movie unlike its previous incarnation is modelled on a gorilla, yes king kong! I didn't like that at all, its look, movement and facial expressions. I wanted to see a powerful superhuman not a monkey in a circus 'you'll know what i mean' lol.The reason I gave my review an extra star is because there were moments where i laughed. It is funny. But this doesn't make up for the weak clich√©'d story and forced boring dialogue cut scenes between action sequences.The other star goes to the setting and set designs, which were appreciated.The acting was good but the film's action reminded me of a WWE Royal Rumble match. Can't wait for the DARK KNIGHT RISES! It may raise my IQ.thanks",3,27,112,26 April 2012
