The Blair Witch Project," Brr.
","After I got home from seeing _The Blair Witch Project_, I turned on all the lights in the apartment, and tuned the radio to a soothing classical music station.  When I finally decided to go to sleep, I turned on my white noise generator.  I don't think that, after seeing that movie, I could have dealt with the normal batch of random outside noise that is typical of my building.The curious thing is, this is all on account of the last third of the film. The first third, the setup, is entertaining and amusing.  The second third is creepy, disturbing, and suspenseful, but not nearly as scary as the hype might have led you to believe.  But it's the last third, which goes beyond creepy and disturbing and into absolutely bloody terrifying in the last ten minutes, that makes this movie as memorable and brilliant as it is.",10,1,2,22 July 1999
