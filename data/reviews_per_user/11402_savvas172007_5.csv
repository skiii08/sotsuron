Iron Man 3," Breathtaking
","'Iron Man 3' was pretty good! The acting of Robert Downey Jr. was excellent. The whole movie was funny enough and it also had several breathtaking moments. I watched it 2 hours ago and I'm still fascinated. Picture was perfect in its 2d release and I suppose that there won't be much upgrades in its 3d version. Gwynneth Paltrow was decent, but still wasn't as good as Downey. Ben Kingsley was perfect! His British humour made all the minutes he appears on screen to move the whole theatre into laughter! All the battle scenes were amazing and most of them made me stare on the screen and leave my pop-corn and cola for later! Having watched the two initial films a week ago I really had into my mind to see whether a third installment on the franchise was needed. Well, 'Iron Man 3' is the best film of the trilogy and I dare to say that it was better than most of other superhero movies. I'm really looking forward for the next film with Iron Man!!!! Till then I'll watch The Avengers!!!",7,2,13,29 April 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," That's what Harry Potter is about....
","First of all it's crucial to mention that I have grown up reading Harry Potter books. Since my 11 till now Harry Potter is an important part of my life. OK. It's easy to call me a nerd but I assure you I am not. When I first read the Philosopher's Stone I awaited to watch its movie. I admit I liked it, although many themes of the book were out... As the films were coming out I understood that the script-writer and maybe even J.K. Rowling was up to destroy all our love to Harry Potter's world. For example, 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blod Prince' was my favourite one of the series as a book, but the film really disappointed me. But, let's move on to that movie. When I was reading the epic finale of Harry Potter I was amazed and truly anxious that when it would be transfered into the big screen it may be worse than the 6th one. I WAS WRONG!!! The film kept me from the beginning. A marvelous opening sequence -even better than the book's I think-. But, I don't want to spoil it for those who have not watched it yet. Believe me though, the one quarter of the film will make you cry!!! There were some things that differed from the book (Xenophilius Lovegood's appearance, lack of Krum's argument, different way of catching Harry, Ron and Hermione in the woods) but it didn't matter. It was all excellent. I think it's the best of all Harry Potter films. HARRY POTTER MANIACS THAT'S THE FILM WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR",10,0,3,20 November 2010
Insidious," Average... Certainly overrated!
","I had heard that Insidious would care my wits out... Apparently it didn't. It's not a good movie nor a good horror film. It had some good moments but nothing serious. The only spooky moment is at the end and it lasts only for 5 seconds... The plot, though, was based in a pretty good idea... Watch it just to understand how marketing works and how a mediocre film is promoted like the 'scariest movie after The exorcist'... Oh, please! It only scared me as The grudge 2! And on how I see it Grudge 2 wasn't a film to make you scared but to make you bored! Acting was pretty good and music was also pretty good. PLOT: 7 ACTING: 6 SCARY MOMENTS: 3 DIRECTING: 4SO... HERE COMES A 5/10.",5,0,0,3 May 2012
Coyote Ugly," My favourite one...
","OK. I know it's definitely not the best film ever made, but it's my favourite one. I watched it when I was 11, and I couldn't resist on its magic. My sister owned the OST, and there were many times per month I used to listen to it. Anyway, I think that the whole story of a girl coming to the big city, full of dreams and no money and finally makes it, is totally motivating. I suppose many guys will think I'm stupid loving a chick-flick, but keep in mind that it's also about a bar full of bartenders singing, dancing and... showing what they've got!!! But, it was also a great film. I've watched it more than 15 times ( I stopped counting four years ago), and I gather it's gonna be the movie I'll be watching in future... If you haven't watched it, run and rent a DVD or blu-ray disc of it... A night full of joy is guaranteed.",7,1,2,5 February 2011
Toy Story 3," Back to childhood with a masterpiece...
","I am now 20 years old and so, it was at the age of 7 when I first watched Toy Story. I found it amazing that the toys were alive and all the story was superb either. When I found out that a 3rd part was up to be released I had been dreaming of it all the time. So, I went to watch it. In the theatre there were parents with their kids and thankfully they were really quiet. When the film started with the narration of the ages that had passed, I felt so touched. During the film I was back in my childhood when everything seemed -and were- so easy and I was with no concerns. All the purity of that age came and hit me, although I knew that would happen. I admit that I first found the story average, but when the film was on I was enchanted. There were no thoughts in my mind. I was there watching a masterpiece that in my point of view can be truly appreciated by only us, those who matured since the first movie, but still carrying all the heroes into our hearts. I must admit that I was up to cry in several moments, especially when the toys were in fire and in the end. Leaving the cinema and though I cried -cause, yes, I did!- I was too happy. Entering the house I was singing the theme song...I highly recommend it to you all!!!! 10/10...",10,9,10,12 November 2010
