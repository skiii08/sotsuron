The Sound of Music," A great musical!
","'The Sound Of Music' is my favourite film and musical ever! Once you hear the songs, you'll be singing them for the rest of the day. The songs are unforgettable and just amazing! I love having lots of children in the film as well and having them singing, because most big hit films only include adults, or adults and a couple of children. It's nice for that element. Little Gretl and Marta are so sweet to watch, and one day I dream of being Liesl and performing her role. The film has been an inspiration for me since I was a very little girl, and i hope to fulfill my ambitions of starring in a staged production of 'The Sound Of Music'. I love the film and I will always love it! The dancing, acting and singing inspires me!",10,26,54,25 August 2005
