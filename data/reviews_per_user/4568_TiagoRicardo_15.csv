The King's Speech," Colin Firth was born to play King George VI
","I finally had the chance to watch 'The King's Speech' and after that I was impressed with such magnificent performances by Geoffrey Rush and Colin Firth. It was in fact a really amazing and inspiring film. I have to admit that I was a little bit skeptical with the film after the Oscars ceremony because I am a huge fan of Nolan's masterpiece 'Inception', but god I was wrong. 'The King's Speech' it's a lot more than just a biographic picture. This fascinating history gains even more impact with the casting choices. Colin Firth was born to play King George VI such as Philip Seymour Hoffman was born to play Truman Capote. It was definitely an exceptional performance. It was really hard for me to imagine how a story about a speech could be that interesting. The complicated relationship between Lionel and George and the improvement of George speech skills gave a touch of humanity and power to the film. Everyone should watch this film, not just for the historical aspects of it but also for the wonderful and captivating story of one man who will fight against all his fears and troubles so that he could give to his country the most important speech of his life. 'The King's Speech' it's a really well told story that will please you for sure!",9,2,3,3 February 2014
Captain Phillips," An intense adventure
","Paul Greengrass, known for 'The Bourne Ultimatum' and for 'United 93' brings us a really intense thriller about the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US- flagged MV Maersk Alabama. With a really intense atmosphere and a powerful story, 'Captain Phillips' it's definitely a must-see for everyone. Another excellent movie that after grabbing your attention, will leave you speechless until the credits role. With 'Captain Phillips', Paul Greengrass manages to provide the same intensity level of 'United 93' adding a much more powerful story. Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi have done terrific jobs by interpreting really difficult characters. It's impossible not to feel moved with Tom Hanks performance as Captain Richard Phillips. The other three actors that portrayed the pirates that hijacked the ship, have also made really remarkable performances, giving a sense of realism to the movie I was not expecting to see.This adaptation of the book 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea' by Captain Richard Phillips himself will therefore bring you some really strong emotions and feelings.So if you want to watch a movie with a powerful and remarkable story with brilliant performances and intense action sequences and experience this realistic adventure that will get your attention right from the beginning, 'Captain Phillips' it's my suggestion for you. 'Captain Phillips' it's definitely one of the best films of the year!",8,0,0,7 February 2014
Gravity," Gravity - An IMAX 3D Experience Review
","First of all, let me just start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Alfonso Cuarón's work and that for about 1 hour and half I just felt I was right there in space. 'Gravity' was one of the most promising movies of this season and without any doubt it was successful. This space epic, about two astronauts (George Clooney and Sandra Bullock) who are lost in space after a huge explosion in space, is full of action and impressive special effects. After James Cameron's 'Avatar' I have never thought there could be a movie with greater special effects but I was wrong. The mix between the well written storyline and the special effects make this an Oscar nominee for sure. 'Gravity' is definitely one of the best movies of the year and the proof that sometimes 3D can improve our movie experience. The IMAX Experience of 'Gravity' just made the movie more amazing than it is. In conclusion, Alfonso Cuarón's new movie is one of those which I expect that years from now people will talk about. 'Gravity' scores 10 out of 10. IMAX Experience Review: Sound: 8/10 Visual Effects: 10/10 3D: 9/10 IMAX Experience Score: 9/10 -IMAXWORTHIT-",10,2,5,27 October 2013
World War Z," An action film that will fulfill your desires
","There's a lot of weird and crazy stuff happening in 'World War Z', a zombie film that fulfilled my daily dosage of action. I understand that a lot of people will be against my opinion but I did actually enjoyed a lot this film. You will not find the typical zombie horror film in 'World War Z'. This film it's like a mix of really awesome action sequences filled with a large amount of visual effects and poorly executed horror sequences. There are some moments when you can't figure out what the hell it's happening because the action scenes are a little bit fast and confuse. The zombies were okay and there were some intense sequences (for example the plane sequence) that made the movie a lot more enjoyable. 'World War Z' it's not great but it had style and fulfilled all my expectations.",6,0,1,3 February 2014
Argo," Affleck has done it again
","It's becoming a fact without a single doubt that Ben Affleck is a better director than an actor and 'Argo' is a proof of that. I have to confess that I had the high expectations on this one and it did not disappointed me. In fact I would have never predicted that 'Argo' was going to be such a very enjoyable ride. The tension represented in the early segments of the movie drives the spectator to a very amusing story about a man whose job is to take a group of people back to America. Alan Arkin character is great and Affleck is not bad at all. 'Argo' is an attempt to recreate the escape from Iran of the American embassy employees and despite having some misinterpretations of the facts, it's a very well made movie and really pleasant to watch. 'Argo' is therefore a victory for Ben Affleck's career and a great movie for everyone to watch!",9,0,2,4 November 2013
About Time," Magnificent
","Apparently time travels are one of the keys to success because this movie hit me right in my heart. 'About Time' touched me in way that no movie has ever touch. A simple story about love that has enough strength to make everyone laugh and cry. The story of a guy who is unhappy with is life and who discovers a very powerfully gift which will transform his life forever. It's really hard to say bad things about this film, the characters, the story, the soundtrack and all the details were really good. Perhaps the best romantic comedy I have ever seen, 'About Time' accomplishes everything I love about romantic comedies, it's a compassionate, magical and lovely story with a little bit of comedy. Go and watch this one, I promise you won't be disappointed.",9,3,7,3 November 2013
American Hustle," Captivating, powerful and fun.
","First, in 2010, David O. Russel brought to us 'The Fighter', a highly acclaimed film by both critics and audience worldwide (still on my watch list) and then, in 2012, he directed a really touching and funny romantic comedy named 'Silver Linings Playbook' which drove him back to almost every known award ceremonies. So, after this two huge successes I have to confess that I had tremendous expectations for 'American Hustle'. Adding to this, I have to confess that having Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawerence and Bradley Cooper in the cast was one strong reason for having great expectations. 'American Hustle' is basically the story of a couple (Christian Bale and Amy Adams) which is forced to work for a FBI agent (Di Maso) who wants to capture some of the most powerful criminals including politicians and mobsters. A story about power, corruption and love where the huge wish of Di Maso puts everyone lives in danger. Christian Bale's character, Irving, was so wonderful to see on the screen. It was full of life and confidence and his relationship with Sydney (also brilliantly played by Amy Adams) only reinforced the strength and power of his character. A lovely couple with a troubled relation. Most of their problems were caused by Irving's wife (played by Jennifer Lawrence) who manipulated Irving, forcing him to stay with her and with their son. But when Irving and Sydney met Di Maso, their lives are turned upside down and they have to fight for their lives while they are helping the FBI on this huge case. 'American Hustle' it's therefore, more than just a story of a con man that hustles to survive. Its the story of four characters that hustle to survive. And it's not difficult to understand why all the main actors/actress are nominated for Oscars. I was so amazed with the atmosphere of the film right from the beginning. It was captivating, powerful and fun. It was an excellent film that confirms again that David O. Russel is a talented director. With such amazing characters and a wonderful story, 'American Hustle' it's, without any doubt, one strong contender to this year's Oscars.",9,0,3,27 January 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," A story about hope and respect
","It is really impressive the way that 'Dallas Buyers Club' catches your attention. A remarkable and powerful story about a man with the HIV virus and who battles against the system to provide hope for those who see their life almost lost. The way that Matthew McConaughey plays his character is really impressive and it's one major factor that made me enjoy this movie more. It's a really powerful movie and one true contender to this year's Oscars. It's a movie about learning, about respect and about hope. The way that Ron's mind change about homosexuality provides also a certain touch of humanity and kindness to the story. With outstanding performances of Jared Leto and Matthew McConaughey, 'Dallas Buyers Club' is definitely a must-see!",9,6,9,3 December 2013
Prisoners," A powerful and emotional thriller
","What would you do if suddenly your son disappears without leaving any trace? What would you do if you felt your son's life was in danger? 'Prisoners' shows us that our worst fears can sometimes take control of our minds and change our way of acting and thinking. So what if you lost your daughter and no one is capable of helping you? 'Prisoners' is the story of two families who are confronted with this exact situation. In 153 minutes we are invited to look to the changes in the family members's behaviors while they lose their hope. Finding his daughter is the one thing that Keller Dover, played by Hugh Jackman, has on his mind and when he sees that Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is not following his clues, he decides to make justice by his own hands. This powerful and emotive story about families, love, and fear is one great Drama full of suspense and outstanding performances by all cast members. 'Prisoners' is alongside with 'Gravity', one of my Oscar predictions for the next year.",8,1,1,4 November 2013
12 Years a Slave," A powerful story about slavery
","At last I had the chance to watch Steve McQueen's adaptation of the Solomon Northup's book '12 Years a Slave'. Solomon Northup (brilliantly interpreted by Chiwetel Ejiofor) lived in New York with his family (his wife and his two kids). His life was stable, he was a free black man living the 'American Dream', until he was invited to join two other men to preform in several places, since he was a brilliant violinist. But unfortunately for him, the invitation was just the beginning of the worst time of his entire life. Solomon ended abducted and sold into slavery. While being a slave, Solomon faced the cruelty of some white men who just treat them like their property and a series of events that are really tough to watch. In fact, there are only a few things that are easy to watch in this 2-hour drama. Fassbender's character was really powerfully and I must confess that there were times where I was really angry about it. So much power and greed drove him to complete madness. Fassbender was really great portraying a slave owner, giving a huge touch of cruelty and evil to the film. It was really hard for me to imagine how could someone treat another one with such amount of cruelty. Without only a little amount of hope, Solomon sees him self trapped in this 'nightmare' and tries to survive to the whole thing. After long years of suffering, Solomon sees at last the opportunity to escape after meeting a Canadian abolitionist, Bass, interpreted by Brad Pitt. This powerful and tough drama is also filled with brilliant performances by Benedict Cumberbatch and Lupita Nyong'o. Hans Zimmer also strikes again with a really great soundtrack that involves the audience into the film. But there is a lot more in '12 Years a Slave' than just slavery. I left the theater in complete silence, astonished for what I had just seen. A message of hope, a portrait of the cruelty of men and a powerful story that is tough but also captivating. Steve McQueen really got me with this one. '12 Years a Slave' is a 2- hour drama that will shock you and that sometimes will make you feel angry but there is so much substance in this film that it is impossible for me no to advise you to go and watch it. '12 Years a Slave' is more than a must-see, it is a true masterpiece!",9,4,9,19 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Sex, Drugs, Money and DiCaprio
","Martin Scorsese's comedy based on the story of Jordan Belfort it's a rough movie that manages to provoke and entertain with an odd storytelling and another great performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. I want to begin my review by admitting that I had really high expectations for this movie and I must confess that this 180 minute-long comedy still managed to surprise me a bit. It's a dark comedy about the decadent financial sector and the way that greed and money controlled it. A movie about sex, drugs, lies and money with a dark sense of humor and with really wonderful performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill, who really surprised me by leaving his comfort zone. Everything in this movie works, even the odd storytelling that actually made the film even more interesting. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is definitely not the movie you should see with your family but this journey into Jordan Belfort's career in the world of business it is one hell of a ride!8/10",8,0,6,14 January 2014
Inception," A masterpiece...
","Christopher Nolan brings us 'Inception', a movie about dreams and the capability of changing them. What would you do if you could change the future by introducing an idea into others people dreams? 'Inception' is about a group of people who tries to change one man's mind by manipulating dreams. This idea drives us into a spectacular adventure where minute after minute, the group of people goes deeper to accomplish their mission. With an impressive storyline and an amazing cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Cane and more), 'Inception' is one of those movies you will definitely remember for a long time. After the well conceived 'The Dark Knight', this movie is another example of Nolan's outstanding talent. Therefore, 'Inception' scores 9 out of 10.",10,0,1,27 October 2013
The Conjuring," 'The Conjuring' reaches a new level of intensity and creepiness that possessed me
","James Wan you almost got me with Insidious, and with that I mean you almost gave me the most scary hour and half of my life inside a movie theater. I was scared as s***t but I could handle it. But then, three years later, you were able to bring to the world the most brilliant horror movie of the decade and perhaps one of the best horror movies ever made. I am of course talking about 'The Conjuring'. This amazing film based in the stories of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Flaming) who were American paranormal investigators (associated frequently with 'The Amityville Horror'), got my nerves right in the beginning. There is so much to explore in 'The Conjuring' and the mysterious atmosphere only helps to create the sense of fear. I've seen a lot of movies about possessions but none of them were as good as 'The Conjuring' was. Sequences like the 'clap and hide' game when Carolyn plays it with her daughter and we see the first paranormal appearance in the closet will be really hard to forget. But what makes 'The Conjuring' really special it's the fact that there's a story, a really mysterious story, that the viewer could be easily attracted. I felt the characters fears and I kept wondering my self every time what the hell was going to happen next. I was scared for almost 2 hours but on the moment that those credits role, I knew I've just witnessed the living proof that it's still possible to make excellent horror movies. 'The Conjuring' reaches a new level of intensity and creepiness that possessed me.",9,2,3,3 February 2014
Saving Mr. Banks," A great film for the entire family
","I've only seen 'Mary Poppins' last week and I was amazed with almost everything. 'Mary Poppins' it's definitely a wonderful film for the entire family and a proof of all the magic that Disney it's capable of bringing to the world of cinema. Yesterday, after seeing Disney's 'Saving Mr. Banks' I must confess that I was really lucky for seeing 'Mary Poppins' on the television. Even thought the fact that the 3 minute-long trailer ruined almost the entire plot of the film, I felt happy and moved by this heart-warming story about how Walter convinced P. L. Travers (i mean Mrs. P.L. Travers). The performances of Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are really wonderful to watch. 'Saving Mr. Banks' it's not just a great way to honor 'Mary Poppins' and all the work of Walt Disney. I think, 'Saving Mr. Banks' also adds a bit of magic to the flying nanny story. The plot of the film drives the audience to the life of Pamela Travers (the creator of Mary Poppins), after accepting a deal made by Walt Disney to adapt her story to the big screen. At the beginning, Pamela Travers connection to Mary Poppins it's a bit difficult to understand because she rejects some of the ideas that actually made 'Mary Poppins' a wonderful and touching musical. Days after days, she continues to reject ideas from Disney until they come up with an idea to make her happy. And that idea (the ending scene of 'Mary Poppins') gave the movie, that touch of magic that I was expecting from Disney. And after the revelation of that idea, the audience finally realizes the connection among Pamela and Mary 'Mary Poppins and the Banks' are family to me'. And that connection it's the reason why I felt moved with all the film, because after that moment all the pieces are finally together. So, 'Saving Mr. Banks' it's not just a 'documentary' about 'Mary Poppins', it's about the real meaning of the flying nanny that comes when winds in the east. After seeing it, you will feel moved, happy and you will want to ear one more time 'Let's Go Fly A Kite'. 'Saving Mr. Banks' it's a fantastic movie for all the family!",8,0,1,2 February 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Better than expected
","Let me just start this by saying that I was not expecting great things from this movie, but Marvel has done it right again and i believe that anyone who enjoyed the first movie will not be disappointed with this one. The special effects were really cool and the Asgard scenes were amazing in IMAX 3D. The return of Thor and Loki was by far better than I expected. Loki was really better than in 'The Avengers', it was more funny and more enjoyable to watch. The only negative point in this movie is the villain (Malekith) which is like an accessory to the story. Marvel Cinematic Universe is getting better and I cannot wait for 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Definitely a surprise, 'Thor: The Dark World' is one of those rare cases where the sequel beats its predecessor.",7,9,18,3 November 2013
