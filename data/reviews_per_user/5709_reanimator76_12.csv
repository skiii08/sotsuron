Saturday Night Fever," 'Your a cliche.....your headed nowhere......'
","Saturday night fever is an excellent movie..John travolta gives a riveting performance as Tony Montana, Whoops....Tony Manero LOL This is a story, about rising to the top, overcoming obstacles and ultimately finding love.....",10,0,1,28 January 2003
Glory," Freedom
","I just recently purchased this dvd as a blind-buy and am very impressed. I didnt know much about the civil war and this movie actually had alot of information for the viewer to absorb. Its a sad fact that slavery did occur, and the racial injustice they faced.Acting Wise Denzel Washington was superb, he got his oscar for the 30sec, closeup shot when he was being flogged, showing a wide range of emotions...Very Powerful scene.Even Matthew Broderick made a believer out of me, i thought 'OHH GAWD ITS FERRIS BEULER' but he certainly suprised me..And morgan freeman, what is there to say, he is a god among men...pun intended (Bruce Almighty)..Anyhow ill stop my rant and just say grab the movie its really worthwhile, excellent story/acting/cinematography/sound its a perfect movie, and perfection is elusive alot of the time",Null,0,0,12 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," GUYS LISTEN UP
","Yes, this is truly a Great Film,. but to honestly let it rank as #1 is appauling..No way can it beat The Shawshank Redemption and the Godfather..this movie is purely good entertainment, but has no redeeming values, such as The Shawshank Portrayed..I think people should re-think there votes, i mean fair enough Its an excellent film and thoroughly, enjoyable but so was TERMINATOR 2 on release, and i dont see that as #1.",Null,0,0,25 December 2001
U-571," Riveting Thrill Ride
","This was a great movie, full of tension, and suspense. The plot was also very good, and the performances by the actors were top-notch..Although I havent seen 'DAS BOOT', i will definitely, soon because of all its acclaim. SEE U-571 one, its a great film, depicting the bravery of US NAVY soldiers.",10,0,8,4 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," OVERRATED!!
","I like this movie no doubt about it..it would possibly be one of the best movies to emerge out of this year but the fact that annoys me is this movie is only based on special effect. Theres no actual acting talents being brought forth in this movie so why is it going so popular.True that Jackson is a amazing director but this movie doesnt come near godfather, the shawshank redemption or citizen kane. A grand film BUT definately not a masterpiece and highly overrated",8,0,2,17 December 2002
Dumb and Dumber," Dumb but FUN
","I wondered in here out of sheer curiousity and im suprised to see the positive feedback on this movie i really enjoyed it. Its not oscar material butit does provide side splitting laughs, galore..i cant really believe so many critics have to BLAST this movie though, i guess they dont understand CARREY humour..But beware Dumb and Dumberer looks terrible id steer clear  and keep to the classics

Total Recall," Great VERHOEVEN flick
","This is a great, entertaining thrill ride of a movie.For its time, it had cutting edge Special effects, and was visually stunning depicting the decay of 'MARS'. Although the violence was excessive, it wasnt unbarable. See this film, its a great flick from a masterful director, but just avoid HOLLOW MAN.",10,0,2,4 January 2002
Army of Darkness," Yo 'She BitCH'!!!!
","Haehaeh This is one of the greatest, 'B-Movies' of all time...A guilty pleasure...Being a Sam-Raimi Fan, hmm...('the Gift') was so-so, i was definitely hooked on the evil dead series and this was no different. I definitely feel this movie deserves 7.2/10 if not more, and since i voted 10/10 to keep it high 'HAAHHHHHAHA'...Anyways this is  a great movie with BRUCE CAMPBELL 'Ash' spitting out one liners left and right, its downright hilarious and the special fx still hold up.See this film, and judge for yourself. One of the most underrated actors of all time...Bruce Campbell",10,4,5,28 January 2002
Kingpin," You Will Die Laughing!!!
",This movie is one hell of a funny movie and who wouldnt disagree because it was made from the farelly brothers.These people give excellent proformances and the Farelly brothers should be recognised for their excellent piece of film.After watching this movie i felt sympathy as well as to many cramps from dying of laughter.I recommend this movie for those who have not seen it.....get out of your seats NOW..and go rent it!!,Null,0,0,18 December 2001
The Iron Giant," Cartoon Masterpiece
","This was an excellent, intelligent, and ultimately touching animated film.The animation was excellent, and the movie sent some good morals...The movie was also, quite sad and although i didnt cry my sister , was reduced to tears. This movie is great and will live in your memory for a long time.",Null,0,1,3 January 2002
Trainspotting," Great movie with a strong message!
","I saw this movie only 2weeks ago, and i love it... The actors, music, tone, everything was great about it. Even though it did contain some shocking scenes, it was still a watchable an enjoyable movie as compared to the shock-fest 'REQUIEM FOR A DREAM'. In comparison, Trainspotting conveyed the anti-drug message much better then requiem.",Null,0,0,15 December 2001
The Truman Show," The Burbank Show
