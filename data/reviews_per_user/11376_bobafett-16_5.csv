Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great film
","This is a great film. I am a star wars freak and was not disappointed at all. The film had flaws as all do, but it was still great. Unfortunately the critics ruined the film for some people. They said that the film was horrible, but thats what they said about the episodes 4,5,and 6. Now they love it. I will answer their main complaints.1. Jar Jar-- Yeah he got annoying at times. He was put in for the kids. Like the ewoks. And also like the ewoks he eventually grows on you. See it more then once to see what I mean.2. Underdeveloped characters-- This is the introduction. You will learn more about all the characters as the next two come out. Especially Qui Gon Jinn.3. Bad acting-- They're some bad performances, but there are some good ones. Liam Neeson, Ewan Mcgreggor (perfect for the role), Ian Mcdermind, and who could forget, Frank Oz.The biggest problem I had with the movie was Anakin. I felt that he was too young. So when the one part where him and padme say that they care for each other it seems more like a mother-son relationship and not something that will develop into a husband-wife. They could have made him a little older but everything else was good. I liked how they snuck in E.T. and other creatures. And the fight scenes were done masterfully. 9 out of 10",10,0,0,7 July 1999
American History X," A great film
",American History X is a story about the effect of white supremacy. It stars the great actor Edward Norton as the Neo-Nazi who gets out of jail and finds his brother in the same group he was in. The film had great camera work and the flash backs were brutal.The one problem I had with the film is that it ended with the wrong message. It was overall a great film with great and mesmerizing performances by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.,9,0,0,2 March 1999
Saving Private Ryan," The greatest war film ever
","Saving Private Ryan is one of the best films. It shows how truly gifted Spielberg is. It starts out with the most horrific 25 minutes I have ever seen on film. What I would like to rave the most over is the acting, especially Tom Hanks (his best performance),Giavanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies,and Tom Sizemore. The first 25 minutes of the film is some of the greatest camera work in the history of film. This film shows the true horrors of war and I now have admiration for the soldiers who fought in the war.",10,0,0,2 March 1999
Schindler's List," The Greatest Film I have Seen
",This is a work of art. Not only that it proves that Spielberg is a great director. I first saw this movie when it came out. I was twelve and even then I was impressed. This also managed to bring out some of the greatest acting I have seen. Liam Neeson was perfect for the role. He brought strength that no other actor could. Ralph Fiennes was at least equal if not better. He created one of the greatest villains in history. Yet he brought the human touch to the role. It was the saddest movie that I have ever seen and the most important. Spielberg has created a masterpiece that will be remembered for many years.,10,9,14,26 April 1999
The Nightmare Before Christmas," The best animation I have seen.
","I was astounded when I saw this movie. It is one of those rare animations that you see something different. Usually it is all formula, but when Tim Burton has something to do with the movie, then you know that it will be different. People complained that it was too scary for little children. Hence the word NIGHTMARE and the PG-13 rating. It is there for a reason. But this was a very fun movie, had a great soundtrack that I bought. Danny Elfman should have been nominated for music and songs. His music and singing were terrific. The story was very cool and funny and it is a movie that I will add to my collection.",10,1,2,1 February 2000
