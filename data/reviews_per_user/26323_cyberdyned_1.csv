Iron Man 3," A movie for small children
","Unfortunately IM3 was not as good as the previous movies of the trilogy. Its more an Audi advertisement, with a very weak scenario. I think its a very good movie for little children (ages 11-15) but for grown people who are old Marvel and DC fans, its not good... RDJ on the other hand is doing what he does best. His acting is funny and saves the movie sometimes. However having panic attacks wasn't so convincing Mr RDJ. About the IM suits, lets say that they are too many and very easily destroyed. Oh you charge IM suits? I thought that the arc reactor supplied the power, not a car battery... disappointing at least. And RDJs only friend Jarvis was uncharged also OMG! Please Hollywood be more creative! We love Iron Man, don't create lame scenario just to end the trilogy with a happy ending. I saw the movie at my local theater and I was not pleased... Good for pizza time guys. Nuf said...",4,23,47,25 April 2013
