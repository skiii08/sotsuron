Antz," So what about the language?
","I don't know where some of these people are from, but where I'm at kids know and use words like damn, hell, crap and bitching by the time they're seven or eight at least. That's how it was when I was growing up. If you don't want your kid hearing the language in this film, you better not let them go to school; I guarantee you they'll hear far worse language there. This film is not for little kids less than 5; it's PG for a reason, and not just the language. You should know that if it's rated PG, it's probably not meant for kids 5 years old or younger, so if you take kids that young to this film, you have only yourself to blame, not the studio or filmmakers.  Otherwise, if your kids are older than 5, don't let a few uptight people keep you and them from seeing a really good, really fun movie. I for one am glad someone was willing to make an animated film that satisfies both adults and kids. I hope DreamWorks keeps it up and puts out more films like this, and doesn't let their movies be ruined by trying to please everyone.",9,0,0,9 October 1998
Blade," Not that great
","This movie opened up really strong. The bloodbath scene in the opening was great, and the sequence in the hospital featuring the burnt vampire was cool too. After that though, the movie falls off. The later action scenes are too chaotic and poorly edited... can't they leave the camera in one place for more than a millisecond? The CG effects looked like just that... CG effects. And can someone explain why these immortal vampires with superhuman strength keep going down at a mere kick to the face? Beyond this stuff, the film was moderately enjoyable but nothing special.",5,1,2,5 September 1998
Saving Private Ryan," What more is there to say
","All the other reviews have pretty much summed up how great a movie this is. An instant classic. So I'll just add a few of my own thoughts. This is a must-see movie for a GOOD THEATRE with GOOD SOUND if you want to appreciate the battle sequences. The surround sound puts you right in the middle of the battle with explosions all over the place and bullets whizzing by to the right and left. See it in the theatre with the best sound system possible. The D-Day sequence is one of the most brilliant movie sequences ever filmed. This is Spielberg's second greatest film: Schindler's List is still his most powerful. And this is probably one of the best, if not the best, war films. The only other one that comes close is Full Metal Jacket, which is more disturbing but not as comprehensive or as emotionally involving. As far as the gore and violence, it's intense and brutal but is not nearly as bad as most gory horror films; it doesn't even come close to the Day of the Dead/Dawn of the Dead movies, but it's a completely different kind of violence. It's very real, not fantasy or comic-book violence. I think most 12-year old kids can handle this, and I think most boys 12 and up should see this film, since it will show them a glimpse of what real violence looks like, and maybe counteract the kind of stuff they see in Armageddon and video games.",9,0,0,3 August 1998
Event Horizon," Good Horror if you get past the silly parts
","This is one of the best horror movies i've seen in a while, it's genuinely suspenseful and creepy, and isn't afraid of being gory when it needs to be. There aren't enough gore-fests anymore. It reminded me a lot of a spaceship version of Hellraiser, though not quite as good as that one. There's a lot of plot holes and silly stuff here, but none of that bothered me cause the movie was done well enough to suspend my disbelief. The only part that I couldn't buy into was the way the ship decompressed at the end: The air and everything else would've been sucked out a lot faster and more violently than it was. I really liked the style of the film, very gothic and reminded me a bit of Alien. Basically this is a good horror movie, not very intelligent for a sci-fi movie tho. It definitely works best and is most enjoyable as a horror film.",8,0,1,16 August 1998
Contact," Overrated
","I made the mistake of reading the book first, even though I should know that movie adaptations are never as good. And this movie is no exception. The book is deeper, more intelligent and much more imaginative. The movie is more contemporary and seems a bit dumbed-down. The climax when Ellie meets the alien intelligence is too short, and nowhere near as profound as it is in the book. The best part of this meeting (the revelation of evidence of God found in the number Pi) is completely missing in the movie. As a result, it ends up looking like these aliens brought Ellie all the way across the universe, but didn't have anything to say to her once they got her there. I still thought it was an okay movie, good PR for the SETI program, and more intelligent and thoughtful than your typical sci-fi or hollywood movie. Nevertheless, nothing new or profound is said about the themes that are explored in the movie; any first-year philosophy or divinity student would be ashamed of the discussions these issues are given here. At least the movie had the guts to address these themes of spirituality, faith and meaning in the first place, which is more than can be said for most movies. I would have enjoyed it a little better if i hadn't read the book first, but not by that much.",Null,1,1,12 August 1998
