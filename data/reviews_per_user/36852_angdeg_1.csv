The Blair Witch Project," Disappointing Film
","Foul language throughout the film that annoys. The idea of seeing a film as through a video camera is the most stupid. No scenery or spooky scenes. No music all the film and above all, I never felt scared at any time of the film. The story about the witch that is never seen on the screen is good. I spent only 50p to rent this DVD and I think I wasted my time and money.",1,6,11,5 February 2002
