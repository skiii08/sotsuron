The Lobster," Watch this while you're high
","The lobster is brilliant. I read that a lot of people didn't like the film because it makes so sense, which I found to be the opposite for me. I enjoyed the movie MORE because it made no sense. There were a lot of really well executed jokes and the use of music was amazing in this film. I enjoyed it a lot and would definitely recommend it.",10,0,5,6 April 2018
