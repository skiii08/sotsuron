Spider-Man 2," Great work yet again!

Spider-Man 3," This would have been great
",If only they could've done a better job with Spider Man 3. It would've been up there together with Matrix as one of the few trilogies that didn't suck.,7,0,0,26 November 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Nice work making it more kid-friendly Marvel
","If my kids love it, then I love it too. I actually like this kind of Thor more as he is much more kid-friendly.",8,4,10,26 November 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Perfect animation!
",Oh wow. I am blown away. How on Earth did an animated film such as this do so well? And how were they able to take all these separate characters and give them so much development without the film feeling like it was dragging.,10,0,1,26 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," What a shame
",Some of the scenes were unnecessary and could've been just cut out entirely and the movie would still make sense. I expected more from this 3-hour film but it turned out to be just a complete waste of time,8,0,2,26 November 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Probably the worst Avengers film
",Don't be brainwashed. This is just a remix of the first Avengers movie. Nothing new here except for the new heroes but plot-wise it's pretty much the same thing.,6,0,0,26 November 2019
Thor," Well-written script
","I appreciate very much how they wrote the script, especially the ones for the denizens of Asgard. Well-spoken without being too clunky as Old English would sound.",9,0,0,26 November 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Really bad sequel
",It would've been better if they gave us more information about the bad guy. Sure he's just another villain but a back story would've still been great.,6,0,0,26 November 2019
