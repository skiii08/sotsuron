The Blair Witch Project," WOW!!!
","I am a consistent horror movie watcher, I'm always looking for those horrors that will scare the crap outa me, but I could never find one. I went to this movie on Thursday not expecting too much, cause I heard that it was a $30,000 budget so I didn't expect anything good, just wanted to see what the hype was about. Well, there is no movie that I have ever seen that scared me this much. The whole movie was great, the absolute scariest movie that probably exists. But I fear that there is something else scarier, the person I took to go see it is not a horror fan, and did not like this movie cause it scared the crap out of her, now I owe her and I have to take her to see Runnaway Bride!!!!! Anyways, if you like horrors and scary movies, this is the best one I've seen!!!!!!!!",Null,1,1,7 August 1999
Blade," Vampires??????????
","Those are vampires??? I didn't see any vampires, when did they start putting tattoos on the back of their necks so they know what kind of vampires they are? Well, for you comic lovers, I guess I'll spare it. But for you horror and vampire lovers, this is a sorry excuse for a vampire movie, it was horrible!!!!",1,7,19,13 November 1998
