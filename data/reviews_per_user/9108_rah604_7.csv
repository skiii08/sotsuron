Catch Me If You Can," 'Catch Me If You Can'
","Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, the kid who ran away from home and became a con-artist. Frank successfully impersonates a co-pilot, a doctor and we find that he has other surprises up his sleeve. In the process, Frank uses over two million dollars via forged checks.In 'Catch Me If You Can', director Steven Spielberg strays away from his sci-fi explorations (AI, Minority Report) and gets back to the basics. By that I mean, that he makes a simple movie (no superlative heroes or special effects) that everyone can enjoy.  The entire cast excels here. DiCaprio, uses charm and wit in his performance as the scheming Frank. Hanks is funny in his turn as a nerdy and obsessive FBI agent. Walken gives his strongest performances in years in a small, but pivotal, role as Frank's father.Even though the pace of the film slows a bit during the last third, it is still a witty and immensely entertaining film. This one's a real catch.Rating: (8/10)",8,1,2,23 April 2004
The Others," The Others
","Nicole Kidman (in a spellbinding performance) plays Grace, the WW2-era mother of two. She was left behind to live in a rather huge chateau while her husband went off to war. However, after the war is over, Grace doubts that her husband will ever return. In the meanwhile, she takes care of her two light-sensitive children with the help of a few servants. But, strange events begin to occur in Grace's home. In a matter of time, Grace begins to fear that there are other spirits or ghosts haunting her home.To reveal too many details of the plot would ruin the magic that 'The Others' works on you at the end. It's a twist ending that grabs you and makes you see the entire film in a different way. The same way that 'The Sixth Sense' did. But comparing to 'The Others' to Shyamalan's 'Sixth Sense' could translate into disappointment. The trouble spot is in the pacing of the film. Like in Shyamalan's film, 'The Others' creates its suspension through the tension felt by its characters. However, Shyamalan was a mastermind when it came to keeping its audience riveted. In 'The Others', there are numerous scenes that go on way too long for their own good. Thus, at times the film feels unwatchable. No matter, despite its flaws, 'The Others' works a spell on you.Rating: 7/10 or (3 stars)",7,0,2,11 May 2004
Forrest Gump," 'Forrest Gump'
","This oscar-winning film chronicles the life of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a man of lower than average intelligence.  To give away the plot would take away from the magic of the film.  Let's just say Forrest Gump takes place in a variety of historical events and leads an extraordinary life.  And, in spite of all his accomplishments, Gump's childhood sweetheart, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) continues to elude him.All of the actors shine in 'Gump', especially Robin Wright Penn, as Jenny, and Gary Sinise, as an army lieutenant whose legs are amputated, both give tender and heartfelt performances.  But Hanks steals the show, in what is arguably the best performance of his career.  Hanks is excellent in portraying a man who is unable to understand the hypocritical and unjust nature of society. But acting is not the only thing that makes this movie remarkable. 'Forrest Gump' is just simply film-making at its finest.

The Matrix Revolutions," 'The Matrix Revolutions'
","The critics unfairly targeted and blasted this final chapter in the 'Matrix' trilogy. Although, I am not saying they were completely wrong in doing so. The problem involving the 'Matrix' sequels is one of expectation. After the brilliant first chapter that provided us with an amazing story and with tremendous action and special effects, our expectations were really high for the second chapter. 'Reloaded' still carried the same amazing special effects and knockout action but it lacked the heart of the first film. The plot became more of a puzzle in 'Reloaded', and consequently fell below our expectations. 'Revolutions' was expected to be the grand finale, a rewarding ending that would more than make up for the disappointment endured in 'Reloaded'. But, the ending is where 'Revolutions' stumbles. The ending does not really resolve anything and many audiences were left feeling empty. And as a result, 'Revolutions' received all of this criticism.My stand on 'Revolutions' is that it is a decent sci-fi action movie but it is not a good ending to the 'Matrix' trilogy. As I mentioned the earlier, the ending is quite an empty gesture. But the rest of the film is pretty decent, in terms of action and visual effects, but like 'Reloaded' is nowhere near as good as the first movie. Don't listen everything the critics say, 'Revolutions' nowhere near as bad as most of them say it is.Rating: (6/10)",Null,0,0,23 April 2004
The Evil Dead," 'The Evil Dead'
","Five friends go to a remote cabin and find themselves in the middle of a haunted forest surrounded by mysterious evil forces. Director Sam Raimi, operating on a super-low budget of approx. $300,000, makes a movie that is intense, gut-wrenching and, in a sense, innovative despite the familiar premise. Sure, one can admit that the acting and the gore can be a bit over-the-top.  Heck, even the special effects really pale in comparison to other films in the genre. But one can't deny the creativity that Raimi has put into his film.  This creative sense of the film more than makes up for its miniscule budget. Who says that you need a high budget to make a good film? Watch 'Evil Dead' and find out.Rating: (8/10)",8,1,2,21 April 2004
Army of Darkness," 'Army of Darkness'
","'Army of Darkness' represents a stylish kick-ass finale for the memorable 'Evil Dead' series. The second 'Dead' movie left off with Ash (Bruce Campbell) accidentally being transported to the 13th century by evil forces. You can watch 'Darkness' without having watched the first two as it does provide a quick recap of the events in the first two 'Dead' movies.
In order to get back to the present time, Ash must retrieve the 'Necronomicon' (the book of the dead). But in a rather funny turn of events, Ash must also destroy an army of the dead with the help of a medieval kingdom.  What follows is more fun fight sequences which would rival those of the hilarious second 'Dead' movie. Here, Ash is now made to be more of a larger-than-life hero and Campbell has some fun with the role, getting in plenty of one-liners and plays his psycho to the max.  Director Sam Raimi keeps the movie short, so there is never a dull moment. 'Hail to the king, baby!'Rating: (7/10)",7,2,3,23 April 2004
Evil Dead II," A stylish and slick horror movie that's not afraid to make fun of itself
","The problem with most horror movies is that they take themselves way too seriously.  Fortunately, 'Evil Dead 2', doesn't fall into this category. 'Dead' proves to be as funny as it is gut-wrenching.  The plot involves a man (Bruce Campbell) trapped in a cabin haunted by hellish demons.  Sure, some of the scares are standard horror gimmicks (i.e. zombies, severed hands, etc.). No matter, the film's strength lies in its satirical approach toward itself.  Most of the horror in the movie is purposefully made over-the-top and it works, in terms of humor. It's also a kick to watch Bruce Campbell, who also starred in the first 'Evil Dead', act like crazed psycho throughout the movie. 'Evil Dead 2' provides plenty of laughs for those with a strong stomach. Rating: (7/10)",7,0,0,26 March 2004
