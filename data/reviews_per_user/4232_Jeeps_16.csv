Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Turned me off Star Wars permanently
","Used to like the STar Wars films, back when I was 15 or so. Remained largely faithful to them, or at least liked them a fair bit. Then Phantom Menace came out.It's clear that Mr Lucas merely fluked when he made the original films. He has no talent at all, even with world-creation. I bet for certain that I would be able at least to write a better script. Dreadfully overdone special effects, and characters worse than in any cartoon. I will not watch or hear anything about the other Star Wars films, I reckon. There's no way anyone who takes a project like this seriously, could have the skill to make a watchable film. Also, it has very much tarnished the reputation of the preceding 1970s trilogy in my eyes.",Null,0,1,16 April 2002
Minority Report," Whoa - so many good reviews...
","...Am I really the only one who dislikes this film?This film, which I saw just earlier today, is based on a short story by science fiction master Philip K Dick. PKD fans can rest assured that the original story is more or less intact. Even the cheesier bits, like the precogs, have been retained - also the title, the character names, and a lot of what happens.But PKD's stories get a lot more original than this. Let's face it, anyoine who has read PKD's stuff is not lilkely to latch onto this mid-1950s mild porridge as a good story to adapt. Is this really even worth adapting? To me it was a lapse in PKD's usual brilliance. Come on!Anyway, the end resulyt is a film that has all the cheese of 1950s pulp sci-fi. Frankly, the script stinks badly. The changes that were made to the original story - and there are some - neatly remove the tight plotting of the original story. A morass of shapeless dialogue is left. The  action is silly. The pacing is off. There are boring sections that you wouldn't believe. I can see no action-film buff enjoying this, any more than an intellectual, or a sci-fi geek.Although I repect the fact that other people have a right to like a film that I dislike, here is an example of a film that I think is so blatantly flawed that I wonder what all the other reviewers are on. Did they even see the same film I did??!As a PKD fan, I can only say that I am glad PKD's stories are being given such wide audience now! The Matrix, The Truman Show, The Thirteenth Floor, Dark City, Blade Runner, Total Recall, Screamers, Existenz, Cube, Fight Club, Sixth Sense, Memento, and now Minority Report, are all based on that late genius' ideas.If only Spielberg had done this better, and/or used one of Mr Dick's more original stories to adapt! I want to see Ubik or Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch on the big screen, please! Though it would probably give the studios ulcers if they found out how unconventionally strange these stories are...PS, the Matrix is really cool, and it's probably THE most adequate adaption of PKD's ideas to date!!!",Null,0,0,21 June 2002
A Bridge Too Far," Flawed but still very watchable
","This film is a WWII buff's dream. As far as I know it is THE most realistic depiction of World War II in existence. The Sherman tanks really look good; the uniforms, the hairstyles, the language - everything combines to create a 'real' depiction of 1944.The events depicted are all true. For example, the words used by Horrocks (Edward Fox) during the pre battle briefing are based on reality. Even the leather jerkin and woolly jersey he wears are exactly as in reality. His accent is spot on, too - see 'World at War' to see the real Horrocks being interviewed.There is the perennial problem of the German tanks. No modern war film has depicted German tanks accurately (except Saving Private Ryan). This is simply because they are all in museums. Sherman tanks are relatively cheap to hire.There is the indefineable feeling that one really is watching the original operation. In one scene, a US paratrooper drives a jeep across a field. As he drives, we see the remains of a battle that wasn't even filmed. All the camera shows us is the *remains* of the battle. And it really works.The acting is very good. I mentioned Horrocks before, played by Fox. Other performances of note include Anthony Hopkins as a believeable John Frost; James Caan also plays in one memorable scene.But nonetheless, the truthful moviewatcher cannot help but admit that this film has flaws. Firstly, the film was based on the nonfiction book by Cornelius Ryan. This means that the film has to make its own drama, its own structure. This doesn't quite work. Some bits, esp. towards the end, stick out. Like the fate of the polish brigade, which is almost depicted off-hand. As a whole, from the literary perspective, the film is not exactly brilliant. In fact, someone who knows nothing about the war might get a trifle bored towards the end. No clear resolution, no great victory.But that is not to dissuade the potential viewer. If you like war films with lots of realism, explosions, and some very fine acting, see this film.",Null,0,1,21 December 2001
Gettysburg," Incredible!
","This film is extremely good. 90's epics are often either pretentious nonsense or boring nonsense...Gettysberg is neither. Great, great film and soundtrack. Just one viewing can turn a perfectly normal human being into a ravening, foaming Civil War addict! Speaking of civil war addicts, it is with some amusement that I read the impassioned comments of Americans about this film. For goodness' sake, the war is over! As an Aussie I think I am a neutral in this matter, so I say, shake hands and forgive and...etc. Bottom Line: Top film, makes you realise just how horrifying a civil war is...P.S. the novel is also fantastic.",Null,0,0,7 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," None too good
","I'm afraid I have to say that Return of the Jedi is a shameful end to the trilogy. Not only is it far too cheerful, but the storyline was rushed and weak, the acting was appalling, the spaceships were uninspiringly filmed, the end sequence was cheesy to the extreme, the aliens looked rather....well, they were really bad. There is one redeeming feature...the speederbike sequence is good, even better than the Starwars trench scene. Other than that, I was disappointed.",Null,1,2,3 January 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not just better than Episode I, but a very different film
","The director nowadays has become a cartoonist. I can't help thinking this as I look at how ridiculously big and bloated CGI has become in films. Give me physical effects any day. Ah for the 1980s.Episode I of Star Wars exaggerated this fakeness by having virtually no violence or death. Episode II has a far more gritty feeling to it, with the slickness of the balloon-animal graphics slightly temepered by reality. There is still a jellybean-reality to these CGI models. The green jedi Yoda, for example, looks more (not less) fake than in 1980. But at least there is that grittiness lending some reality to the situations.This grittiness extends to the film itself. No more tergetting at 3-year-old viewers: this film is violent, dark and atmospheric, perhaps targetted at adults. Ultimately this is an improvement. I suspect many 'normal' moviegoers were permanently turned off Star Wars because of Episode I. Maybe Lucasfilm has lost a major part of its audience. I cannot imagine anyone ignorant of the older trilogy actually wanting to go past Phantom Menace.Someone once said of Episode II: 'This is the one film that can be hailed as great simply for being better than atrocious.' The gentleman who said that was 100% correct. However, I think the quality of this film is fairly good even ignoring the Star Wars label. I went in with the strongest doubts, and was pleasantly surprised. So it was not simply a question of believing the hype.As far as continuing the older trilogy's story: as Ewan Macgregor said, this film has far more of the atmosphere of the original trilogy. You will see elements of the older story here. In fact, some references are so quick that it might be an idea for people fond of Star Wars to see it twice. Did you notice Obi-Wan cutting someone's arm off in a nightclub, just like in New Hope? - the spherical spaceships on the Federation planet prefiguring the Death Star? - the first appearance of the Imperial March theme in the music? - the first appearance of the Imperial logo? - the gun in Amidala's hand, which is identical to Princess Leia's? - the primitive Star Destroyers at the end? (were they the Victory-class star destroyers seen in the computer-games?) - Anakin being trapped in machines, both figuratively and literally?Acting: the less said the better, although admittedly it is an improvement over the first film. The dialogue remains problematic, but again, a massive improvement. Obi-Wan Kenobi (the Jedi knight) is given terrible lines at the beginning of the film, terrible lines.Overall: this film is a massive improvement over the first film, and has also an atmosphere of grittiness that makes it a very, very different experience. It is definitely worth spending money to see, specially if you know anything at all about the older trilogy. If you know nothing of Star Wars at all - or are (like me) not much of a fan - then it is still worth seeing. It is certainly better than the previous film.",Null,0,0,18 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Impressive, flawed
","There are several problems with this film.First, structurally it is a nightmare. I can imagine persons unfamiliar with the book being downright confused by it. The reason is that, basically, 'Fellowship of the Ring' was not originally a self-contained story, but part of a larger 'epic'. Hence the peculiarities of the film's structure, which is unengaging and seemingly sloppy.Second, it is corny. I just wanted to laugh at the ridiculous orcs, the excessively long cave-troll scene, the bits where Gandalf and Galadriel go into a sort of acid-trip shapeshift for no readily apparent reason. The most corny bit is Gimli the Dwarf's part. He sounds like the Cookie Monster, with none of that particular gentleman's style. Along with corniness is a descent into fantasy-cliche. The orcs have such poor vocal chords that it is impossible to tell what they are saying. Same for the Nazgul. Tolkien's bad guys always clearly enunciate their syllables. Besides, even if they didn't, the film was obscure enough before. Why not make the orcs speak in good Queen's english?Thirdly, the characters are poorly presented. This is unsuprising for a film that is already struggling at three hours' length. There was a limit to how much exposition could be put into a film already seriously crammed for space.HOWEVERI do admit this film has its moments - it really does. For someone who has read the Silmarillion, the scenes from the epic past are magnificent. (possible spoiler) Sauron's epic Battle of Dagorlad, three thousand years before the film's story, is jawdropping. Sauron's hammer (is that what it is?) is particularly impressive; and Sauron's helmet is the evillest bit of constume design I have seen. It is really spooky.The bits where the Elves speak in good Elvish are (as far as a non-Tolkien fanatic can tell) accurate and enthralling. It's a little like a foreign film made by a culture that doesn't actually exist.Rivendell is nice. So is Hobbiton.Bilbo Baggins looks the part.Most enthralling is the effect the Ring has on the characters in the story. Even Aragorn and Gandalf are severely tempted by the Ring, and its infinite power. Frodo's continuous temptation to put on the ring is strong here; and presumably will get stronger as he gets closer to Mordor. When he puts on the ring (spoiler) he enters a shadow-world just as described in Tolkien. Very impressive, and not over-done.The Eye of Sauron, which appears often when people get near the ring, is impressive. I am wondering if people unfamiliar with the book will actually recognise it as an Eye, however. At first, I thought it was a burning stick...Anyway, in conclusion the film is seriously flawed, but it must be admitted that it has its moments. Its structural problems and lack of character development were probably inevitable, given the source material. It would be better to wait until the other two parts of the trilogy come out before making a final judgement on both these points.Jonathan Lim",Null,0,0,27 December 2001
Amadeus," Great
","My favourite bit is the part at the beginning, where Mozart improvises an 'improvement' on Salieri's music - without even seeing the score!This film may be seen as ahistorical - but if it is, it is based on old myths. Even Beethoven believed that Salieri killed Mozart. In fact, at one time Salieri was let into an asylum, just as in the film, claiming that he had poisoned Mozart. He later denied it. But nonetheless the film can be seen as historical in that Salieri is mad at the time, and watching the film we are seeing the past through temporarily insane eyes.  There are some indications to suggest such an interpretation is correct. For example, Salieri thinks he killed Mozart at the beginning of the film - yet at the end of the film we see he has done nothing of the sort - he mrely plots to kill Mozart, who dies of overwork and illness.In other words, don't knock the film for being too fictional. It can be seen as a view of Mozart through the eyes of Salieri who is temporarily mad.Jonathan Lim",Null,2,4,6 June 2001
Blade Runner," Neon City...mmmmm.
","Blade Runner definitely caused a real Neon Big Bang when it came out. It would be ridiculous to say that  it is solely responsible for the now-well-known phenomenon it created - one need only look at the works of Moebius, and indeed Gibson's early work - but it is the main mover of one of the most haunting image to come from the 1980s...cyberpunk. It would be difficult to find another film that created a whole new genre in sf...It would also be difficult to find an sf movie that seems to be coming true. In my home town of Sydney, the Asian neon burning at night is starting to become more and more familiar... In addition, Blade Runner is excellent on the purely movie level. The sometimes brilliant acting is bolstered by an altogether enigmatic edge to the imagery and music, of the kind seen in Space Odyssey. In short, Blade Runner is fantastic.",Null,0,0,2 January 1999
Blade Runner," A vicious satire of the world
","Corporations housed in buildings shaped like Aztec temples. Artificial owls representing false wisdom. Cityscapes burning with all-pervasive media and evil-looking pollution. This is the world of Blade Runner.And, horrifyingly, it just might be ours too...The future world presented in Blade Runner is both unimaginably horrible, and hauntingly familiar. See 'The Terminator' (1982) to see what Los Angeles *really* looked like in the early 80s.Then flick over to Blade Runner.Is it my imagination, or is Blade Runner actually *more* like 1990s cities than 1980s cities?Ridley Scott, you genius.",Null,0,0,16 September 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A classic...but it's ONLY a movie!!
","Star Wars. Definitely the progenitor of the most powerful, tightknit, popular and above all RICH movie cult in history. There are few other movies that virtually every man in the street can give a brief but sentimental speech about. Even the sound of the music can send Starwars buffs reeling with memories of a galaxy far, far away... But, what of my own point of view? I think that, although Starwars is a classic, it's ONLY a movie. In other words, people writing literally whole bookshops full of star wars novella, have one year courses on the various intricacies of the Star wars universe, and literally crawl under wire to sneak snapshots of Episode One at risk of life and limb...they are overdoing it juuuuust a bit. Juuuust a little bit. On the whole, a remarkable piece of world-creation at a relatively low budget. Just leave the wire alone...",Null,0,0,2 January 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It's all in the music.
","Look, don't get me wrong. I am not a born Star Wars hater. Until very recently, I was a massive Star Wars fan.I am not a fan any more, nor could I ever be. Star Wars is an addiction that I have thankfully shaken off.What makes Star Wars such a fanatic subject for people? I'll tell you why. It's all in a carefully crafted system. Note, for instance, the way a Tie Fighter screams on the same note as the music. I'm not sure which note that would be, but I am convinced they are the same. The same goes for Chewbacca's scream and Vader's breathing. They are all carefully made to sound unique, so that people will get an overawed feeling of being in the prescence of an entirely new universal culture. The same goes for visual cues. Note the continued motif of the Hexagon - in the Tie Fighter's wings, in the Star Destroyer's silhouette, in the shape of the Death Star's corridor. This, again makes people feel they are watching a completely unique universe.Then, of course, there are the cues that are _not_ alien. For instance, the Bantha is clearly meant to be an alien version of a camel. His horns are a massive version of a sheep's horns. Again, look at the clothing of Vader, Kenobi and Leia. All are in some classical style, that makes one feel one is watching something magically significant....when in reality we are picking up visual cues that are reminiscent of something else that tugs on our memory.One further thing. This is why Star Wars will _never_ look obsolete. SO many people think it is because of some magical artistic RUBBISH. Actually it is because Lucas rose so much above 70's visual aspects, and used shapes, sounds and music from the past. For instance, the use of classical style music was a shrewd maneuver, as it is more timeless than some 70s psychedelic garbage. It makes the appeal far more likely to last.Finally, the music itself. John Williams is the true genius of the entire shebang. He was the one who made Star Wars rise above the cartoonish crap it was. Whoever saw a cartoon with a truly classical-style score played really loud? If such a cartoon existed, it would undoubtedly make greater impact. And why? Because having old-style music that is timeless (note how much it resembles 19th century patriotic music eg Elgar) makes each event seem more important than it is. How could the scene where Skywalker stares at the suns have as much impact without a somber fanfare that plays whenever he daydreams? It would not.So there we have it. I would urge all Star Wars fanatics to consider carefully what I say. Why does Star Wars 'strike a chord you can't really place'? Why does it look 'timeless?' Just consider my points and be more critical of Lucas's cunning ploy.",Null,0,0,24 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the 'trilogy'
","Undoubtedly, by movie standards, ESB is the best of the trilogy. Unlike Starwars and Jedi, Empire is a profoundly mystical experience, dark and gloomy yet still part of the Trilogy. The first movie was absurdly simple and cheery - especially the end; the third movie would be fairly cheery and slightly slow. Empire is just at the right timbre for a good movie, as well as having what is currently the greatest movie soundtrack of all, according to my sources. All in all, a good movie and quite an experience.",Null,1,2,3 January 1999
Braveheart," Nice scrap. (not that scrap!)
","Braveheart...about as historically accurate as....as any Hollywood film. Yet, one can't deny that one ends one's viewing of the film with the wish that history was like this. The story was excellent, the battle scenes excellent, the costume design excellent, the .....well, you get the idea. Nice pictures of British countryside, a lovely Mediaeval scrap that is bloodily realistic (except for the odd lack of a bridge...), and generally a memorable experience.",Null,0,1,19 February 1999
Braveheart," Woohoo.
","This is a great film. The battle scenes are just right. The atmosphere is very very mediaeval. The story, the acting, and the cinematography, were fantastic. Allegedly the grand feel of the film inspired Peter Jackson to try his hand at filming Lord of the Rings in a similarly epic style. The music is some of the best heard in a film.There is one major, major problem with this film though...anyone with even a cursory knowledge of British history will notice that this film bears about as much relation to reality as a World War 2 propaganda film. The English are presented as thoroughly evil (ignoring the rather greyer reality!), Robert Bruce is presented as being wracked with guilt for working for the English (Err...similar to theories about Thomas Jefferson, I guess...), the Battle of Stirling is fought on a field (not a bridge...), the armies are dressed in wildly imaginative styles (such as the Scots, who are painted with woad!!!)...the list goes on.On the other hand, still a top film. I can forgive manipulation of history as long as it's reasonably interesting. And as long as it doesn't inspire violence against the 'bad guys'...",Null,0,1,16 September 2000
Gladiator," Less historical than 'Asterix the Gaul'...
","...But who cares!!! In my opinion this film is far better than the hyper-realistic Titanic, which seemed rather sterile. Here we have a fictitious scenario based on real characters. Marcus Aurelius, philosopher-emperor, who is remembered as a _philosopher_ (something he was concerned about in the film!!). Commodus, the insane megalomaniac, who in *real life* fought in the Colosseum against lions  and also other gladiators, thought he was a reincarnation of Hercules, and tried to rename Rome 'Commodiana'! .... Maximus is not a real character, neither are the events depicted in the film. But it is a great story.Highlights:-Seeing a CGI Rome in all its glory was awe-inspiring!-Battle against Germanic tribes: exciting *and* quite realistic!!-Commodus, the insecure madman (not mad enough, though) was my favourite character. Nice white armour!-The 'Middle Period' of Roman history is so little-seen on the big screen - nice to see Hollywood get away from the usual Early Roman Empire/Caesar period.-Proximo was also cool.Bad points:-As a student of history, I can't help but notice things were a *leetle* bit off reality. Saxon and Islamic helmets in a Roman amphitheatre??! Who is Maximus??? (But as I said, I don't mind).-Combat was bloody and exciting, but Ridley's cinematics were a little choppy.-Script was lame in parts. How about cool dialogue like Spartacus and I, Claudius?? Also, not enough swearing for *real* Romans...But overall, a grand experience. For once a big budget film has good acting, good storyline, and the most realistic ancient battle seen on celluloid! Up the Marcomanni!!!PS. An earlier reviewer claimed the Romans had no glass. Well, in short, they _did_. It's just that Hollywood doesn't normally depict it.",Null,0,0,5 May 2000
