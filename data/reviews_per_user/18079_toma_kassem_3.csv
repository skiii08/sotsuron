Source Code," will keep you interested till the very ending
","I was looking forward to seeing ' Source Code ' ever since I saw the 1st trailer, and I was lucky enough to catch it in an advance screening, before it officially released here, and it just exceeded my expectations. this is the type of movies that will keep you interested till the very ending . it's probably the best sci-fi/thriller since Inception ! no big action scenes, no big explosions, no usage of unnecessary CGI, well-written story, solid performance from Mr. Gyllenhaal ( who is now officially one of my favorite actors ) and another hit from my newest favorite filmmaker Duncan Jones. don't miss it !",8,133,205,30 March 2011
Titanic," The most immersive movie experience I had in a VERY long time!
","15 years ago, when Titanic was released, I was just about a 8-9 years old kid with no taste of movies, mainly into comedy ones, and the parental control of course, so it was obviously I didn't catch it in cinema . years later, I grew older, and as it was the teenage days, so watching it was mainly for the famous painting scene! it was the first and only one time I ever watched Titanic, regardless the countless repeating times on the TV, besides the wide availability on the internet. now with the re-release of Titanic in 3-D, I decided to give it a shot, although I usually hate the post-production 3-D conversion, and let me choose my words carefully, I admit this was the most immersive movie experience I had in a VERY long time!. forget about the 3-D which I'm not a big fan of it, but watching Titanic in cinema is beyond imagination! I walked out totally enchanted, and couldn't help myself from whistling James Horner's music over and over again! this is definitely a MUST-SEE in cinema!",8,1,2,5 April 2012
Inception," How to top 'The Dark Knight' ? .. Nolan's masterpiece !
","'How the hell he did that ?' that's what I said after the 2 and half hours of the non-stop heart-breathing mind-blowing experience , Nolan performed on us ! how did he just thought about that ? this is not just another fast-paced action thrilling movie .. no its far beyond that .. deep far i mean .. taking you in a long fascinating journey , exploring the human mind with all its complexity , invading the non-limited dream world , creating almost anything from just your imagination .. i've never seen something quite like that before .. this is definitely Nolan's masterpiece by far , a pure creation from him , when you thought he'll never top 'The Dark Knight' , he blew you away with this .. setting on the edge of your seat almost all the movie run-time , staring at the screen with opened eyes and fast heart-beating , adding to all this a fantastic music goes all over there , that's just to show you how magnificent it is !Nothing extraordinary about the acting .. I mean they were all great , and each one fit his role totally , and all were in their best , but nobody delivers a spectacular performance like for example Heath Ledger's Joker .. the characters weren't deep enough , and you didn't get passionate enough over any of them , except the main one ( Cobb ) , and that's the only flaw there .. but , again , the story here and how it was told , this is what we're talking about and what matters the most .'Inception' is that type of movies that keep you thinking , wondering , imagining , dreaming and talking about it for days , and perhaps for months! i didn't fully understand it specially the ending , and I missed so many details , so a 2nd view is a must indeed !",9,1,3,26 July 2010
