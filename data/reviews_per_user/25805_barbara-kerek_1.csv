Come and See," AN excellent war movie
","Klimov brilliantly shows the real war situation in a small Belarus village, how they fight for their life in the war. Klimov didn't take out the sensitive details, he wasn't scared that the audience will leave the theater. He wanted to let us know and show in his movie that those people went through during that war period, how they screamed when they were burning, and how their murders took pictures front of the burning houses. Besides those war movies which shows the big cities this movie is concentrates to the small villages, because there wasn't any other movie that would do the same. Perfectly shows that the age doesn't matter in war. You have to fight other wise you are going to die. I really like the idea how the director showed to the audience how much the war can change people, through the protagonist boy, Florja. Not just his personality changed and his thinking about the war but also his look, which is well done by the make up artist. At the end a 20 years older face look us back. I founded it as one of the most interesting and memorable war movie.",10,1,1,12 December 2011
