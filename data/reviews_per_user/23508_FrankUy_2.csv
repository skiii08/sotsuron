Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's a Star Wars movie, no more, no less.
","If you're already a Star Wars fan, you'll like this movie. If not, you still won't. Predictable, but beautiful and fun. My only gripe: Midiclorians. There are so many things that I wish they would have explained, but not *that*.",5,0,1,19 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Any parent who takes their kids to this should be shot.
","A very funny, very uncensored movie that really should be NC-17. Anyone who enjoys the show will want to see it, but kids under 14ish absolutely should NOT.I've never said that about any movie before. South Park is just too cute-looking but foul-mouthed for young children. Some stupid Stupid STUPID mom took a pack of four kids under 5 feet tall to the showing I saw, and at least one of them left the theater saying 'cockmaster' (among other things). I don't blame Canada, I blame bad parenting (and guns).But the musical numbers and full frontal Kenny were quite fun.-F.",6,1,3,7 July 1999
