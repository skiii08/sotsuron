Hereditary," Pathetic
","Well I saw the trailer and thought to myself now that looks scary!! The first thirty minutes were fine and I believed it was building up into a good film and hopefully a great finale. Oh dear how wrong can one person be.
The decapitation of the young girl actually did happen, and why would they go through with it as it was obviously thing to do so why ? I fully expected it not to happen (wrong) and then it would deliver something actually surprising totally out of the blue and frighten the audience out of their seats.
Those people saying this was pure art and gave it the full ten stars !! I obviously think they were smoking something Ilegal before they entered the cinema, I am sorry people this was not art !! this was just a shambles and before those critics will say I did not understand this movie,well unfortunately I did oh to well, and what it was attempting to deliver it failed dismally everytime, if it was trying to get the audience nervous in any way or even scared it failed every time because all I did was smile and laugh throughout every time it went for a quick fright.
I am sadly beginning to think the horror genre is now on the verge of being dead for good ( I hope I am wrong) and i am afraid it may be going the same way as the good old westerns genre what also have had their day, and are now consigned to cinema past along with silent films.
This latest attempt left most of the audience laughing that is definitely not what the director was going for and expecting. I know all the ones who have given the higher ratings will say to me and the many others who have hated this dismal movie, that we just do not understand it, well I obviously was not in on their joke ! But I hate to say sorry i was getting it and i got it now, because as one of viewers who is still laughing at what unfolded has it went on !!
Finally I gave it its two stars because of the opening thirty minutes, after that it became a train wreck. Sorry for the spoilers at times in my review , but i am just trying to get my point across. I am still laughing at Toni Collette on the ceiling towards the end it was so pathetic. Please do not bother unless you fancy a good laugh and you are feeling down and suicidal.",2,2,3,16 June 2020
Us," Bad.!!
","Just when I thought my favourite genre HORROR could get no lower in film making, this garbage comes along. Please do not bother save yourself two hours of your life. Utter crap our life dopplegangers live in the sewers and come to takeover our lives. Yes sounds bad and certainly lives up to it.",1,0,0,5 July 2020
The Shape of Water," So so
","This movie doesn't deserve all the (1) ratings on here that's the first thing I'd say. It's original but let's face it it should in no way have a won best picture nominee never mind actually winning best film!! The Darkest hour and The Post to name two, were far better films with far superior acting. This is just an average film what really is quite boring to watch, but worth watching just to see what the academy luvvies saw that I obviously didn't see. One other thing the version I saw had numerous Russian speaking scenes with no English subtitles what was plain stupid. They say it's a beautiful romance and is about the minorities in the 60s, the handicapped, the gay and the black women and that's probly got it its Oscar because that Liberal stuff usually wins does it not.I personally would have given it to The Darkest hour.",5,2,4,3 June 2020
It Chapter Two," Pleasantly surprised.
","The first chapter was good for the first ten minutes !! After half an hour it dropped away very quickly in my opinion to be a very boring film,so to be honest I did not expect much from chapter two either.
So I was pleasantly surprised to love the first hour build up to chapter two.
Don't get me wrong as an horror genre fan this is not scary at all, but it certainly is a much more entertaining watch than the first helping.
It reminded me of a darker version of The goonies and that is by no means a bad thing. The humour was good as this was much needed at the long running time.
As in the original IT films I think at nearly three hours long it was far to long in length.
But overall not a bad movie and would recommend it even if you did not like the first one. The acting was fine from the cast as you would expect from A lister Jessica Chastin and the ever reliable James McAvoy.",7,1,2,8 June 2020
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Action galore
",Well this movie will divide everyone who watches it. You will either love it or hate it simple as that really. I watched it the first time and to be fair was half watching it just not really engaged. So couple of years later here I am watching it again with a more open mind and second time round I loved it. My advice is to ignore the reviews and watch it and don't take it too seriously and like I say you will either enjoy it or just switch it off far to soon. No film can ever be that bad when KC and the Sunshines brilliant song Give it up is on the soundtrack can it. Thought the fight scene in the church was spectacular!! I gave it an 8 but could easily have got higher.,8,1,1,31 May 2020
Draft Day," Superb
","Just when you think Kevin Costners career is on a downward slope he turns it round again in the right way possible with one of the best sporting movies I have witnessed, I rank this alongside another Costner great in field of dreams and Brad pitts brilliant moneyball. Costner was fantastic in this role he was obviously made for and ably supported by many other great cast member performances. The story of the 2014 Nfl draft where he dares and risks his job to get the team he wants. Its an original film focusing on the final 14 hours leading upto the draft, the deals and backroom politics what takes place behind the scenes the loyal fans never see. It was tense and a joy to watch from start to finish.",10,1,1,23 May 2020
