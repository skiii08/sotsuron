The Blair Witch Project," One benefit from this movie
","The only thing I can truly be thankful for is, perhaps, the horror genre will finally move away from the hack & slash gore which has flooded the silver screen for the past 30 years with pale imitators of the original 'Night of the Living Dead'. As for 'The Blair Witch Project' itself, the film is two-dimensional in both character and plot.  I couldn't help but to keep looking at my watch everytime a series of whiny exchanges between the three main characters kept repeating ad nauseam. Unfortunately, the public at large seldom allows themselves the opportunity to view older movies for the first time.  If you would like to see far superior films to 'The Blair Witch Project', I would suggest you rent the original 'The Haunting' from 1963 >'Curse of the Demon' from 1957, 'Five Million Years to Earth' from 1968, and 'Freaks' from 1932. It's interesting to note that 'Freaks' was originally panned by the critics and by the public as being depraved yet it is now regarded as a horror classic which was way ahead of its time. I would encourage you to pick up any of the above mentioned videos when you rent 'The Blair Witch Project' for Halloween.  If you even get the slightest chill from viewing 'The Blair Witch Project' you'll break out in goosebumps while seeing any of the older and far superior videos.",1,1,3,27 October 1999
Unbreakable," Alternate ending? (Imaginary Spoiler)
","I had very few ideas what this movie was going to be about before walking into the theater.  I knew from the trailers that it was about a man who is the sole suvivor of a train wreck and that it was written and directed by the same person who did 'The Sixth Sense'.  I liked 'The Sixth Sense' and I knew I'd have to see this movie early on to avoid spoilers.  I was unexpectedly embarrassed.My first hobby was comic book collecting.  This movie was painfully handled for me.  Samuel L. Jackson's lines concerning comic books made me cringe!  I kept slumping in my seat because I felt like I was being singled out for ridicule.  I knew the director liked twist endings, but I felt humiliated by the time the credits roled.Here's how I would have twisted the subject: (WARNING there is a mix of REAL SPOILERS and IMAGINARY SPOILERS ahead)....... I would have flashed back to Bruce Willis' character, as a child, being in a coma.  One which had been caused by his accident at a swimming pool.  The frequent hospital-bound Samuel L. Jackson's character (still a young boy) would be growing up using comic books as a crutch for handling his unfortunate physical reality.  Jackson would have read comic book stories to the Bruce Willis character.  Even though the Willis character is in a coma he would still have brain function.  Bruce Willis character would have used his imaginary to escape his reality.  We would learn that the entire plot of the movie was how Willis envisioned his life.  His wife would be the nurse who took care of him.  His amazing ability to be unbreakable would be his dream life.Such an ending would be grounded a bit more in reality thus becoming a bit more palatable.  You see, the mind is the most powerful part of the human body.  It can be unbending in it's ability.  It can create a more tolerable existance for one when the odds are against someone.  The mind gives one hope to carry on.  The mind gives one strength to carry on.  The mind is unbreakable.",3,1,2,22 November 2000
Duck Soup," An Amazing Flurry of Fun
","This has remained my favorite movie ever since I can remember.  I've loved the Marx Brothers since my childhood (roughly 30 years ago) and this was the first of their 13 films I saw on TV.  I can understand why it was initially a bomb at the theaters in the 1930s.  The humor is set at lightning fast pace.  A crowd can laugh loudly right over the next few jokes.In the next couple of Marx Brothers films the boys road tested the material so as to time the humor to audience response (plus they added sappy love story subplots).  To me, this puts 'A Night At The Opera' and 'A Day At The Races' behind 'Duck Soup'.The manditory musical numbers inserted into almost all depression-era movies (after the advent of sound) are even tolerable in 'Duck Soup' because the brothers push them over-the-top.  Don't expect an engaging plot.  In fact, don't expect much of a plot at all.  This is one of those films that you can jump into anytime (but you'll later want to see all that you missed).This movie is best viewed on a one-on-one basis.  The perfect film if you're feeling lonely and depressed (as confirmed by Woody Allen in the 1980s with 'Hannah & Her Sisters').  If it were a boxing match, you'd never know what hit you.",Null,0,0,26 August 2000
Life Is Beautiful," A much needed masterpiece in an age of commercial crap
","I wasn't too sure about renting this movie.  I delayed picking it up primarily because it is a foreign film.  I've always felt that the critics were kinder to foreign movies for whatever reason.  This is one instance where the critics gave worthy praise.The spirit of the movie is alive with Chaplin-eque magic.  Almost a combination of 'The Great Dictator' and 'The Kid' (Charlie Chaplin's NOT the Bruce Willis movie).  The lighthearted set up during the first half of the movie is needed to further the plot in the second half of the movie.  The humor is over-the-top, but thankfully, the drama isn't.  The film maker could have decided to be very heavy handed and force the audience to cry. He did not.  I commend him for completely braking away from traditional movie formulas.It wasn't necessary to shove the pain and suffering of the holocaust down our throats.  Many other film makers have already done that.  We know it was horrible.  The entire point of the movie was to show courage in an unusual way not to showcase barbarism.  This whole film had a freshness about it and yet it seemed a throwback to the golden age of movies.Probably one of the best movies in the 1990s due largely to its unique approach of frightening times.",Null,1,2,26 August 2000
The Green Mile," King's patented 'Two-dimensional Character' development
","I've got to say that I'd hoped to like this movie.  And, to be honest, the acting and look of the film  is top-notch.  The huge weak link in the entire production is the story.  And for me that's the entire movie.After all, I bear a strong resemblance to Stephen King (Really!  Pity me). I'd like to be able to be mistakenly associated with someone I could be proud of.  Sadly, I do not admire King's character development.  I have a problem with his 'good vs. evil' running commentary.  I appreciate more depth in literary figures than Stephen King is capable of delivering.I could give several examples of flaws throughout this film.  Why did no one expose Mr. Coffey's ability?  Why did the evil 'Wild Bill' remain quite in key scenes like the pre-execution turned awry?  How could a prison official in the 1930's let a black convicted murderer enter his wife's room and watch as the killer placed his lips on that of the warden's ailing spouse?Too bad the project wasn't handled by Touchstone Pictures.  Maybe then we'd see more parallels being drawn between Mister Jingles and Mickey Mouse. Mouseville in Florida?  Puts me in the mind of Goofy.While having pure characters with contrasts as obvious as 'black and white' (no play on words intended) make easy paint-by-numbers storytelling, it doesn't satify completely.  Hell, I thought old Del (the Cajun convict) was friggin' innocent!!!  And who except Satan-worshipping parents would name their child 'Percy Wetmore'?!  Christ, did they WANT kids to constantly kick the crap out of him as he grew up?!  By the end, I couldn't believe a word of this story.Stephen King needs to learn to start mixing his paints.  His storytelling reeks of a child's ability to use crayons and a coloring book.  He always uses solid colors and stays within the lines.  Black mixed with white makes gray, Stephen!  People in the real world are gray!  There are no absolutes!!!  Start writing for a sophisticated audience and not like a two-bit hack cranking out Depression-era movie serial westerns!  The Fred Astaire movie 'Top Hat' had more basis in the real world than this shell of a story.",4,0,3,1 July 2000
