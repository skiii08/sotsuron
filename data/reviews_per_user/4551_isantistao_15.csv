Scarface," This Movie Is Pretty Good On It's Own, But Compared To The Original It's A Disgrace
","This movie is pretty good when taken alone. But compared to the original, it is a disgrace. The original is the best gangster film of all time, and one of the best films of all time. It was a monumental work of art that made movie history. This one does little to stay true to the original, it completely changes everything. In fact it barely pays homage to it, to the point where it actually overwrote the original and caused it to be forgotten about, which is just a travesty, making it not so much a remake, but stealing.The original was so much better than this one, this one pales in comparison. The original is a classic work of art, this one is a vapid superficial action film. The original was about al capone. This one isn't about any historical gangster, just some cuban. The original was about prohibition during the roaring 20's. This one is about cocaine during the 80's. The original is about the art of film and the darkness of mafia culture. This one is about pop culture and how cool a badass gangster can be made to look.Now I am not saying that this is a bad film. I'm just trying to bring awareness to the fact that it is just a remake of one of the great classics which happens to be one of the best (the best in my opinion) films of all time. And that it is nothing in comparison to the original, which unfortunately most people haven't even heard of, even lovers of this one. And if you like this one, you really need to watch the original.",7,0,1,30 January 2020
Aquaman," Ridiculously Overdone, Painful To Watch
","I was really looking forward to this movie because I love the concept of Aquaman and loved him in the Justice League. But this movie was absolutely painful to watch. Unfortunately I went to the theater to watch it and after a little while it became apparent that this was just an absolutely horrible movie, and I spent most of the time waiting for it to end and luckily falling asleep during parts. Unfortunately it is so long that it was exhausting to sit through. Everything about it is super over exaggerated it is ridiculous. It is like it was made for children or something. And it is also extremely over-produced as well. I went there hoping to get sucked into a fantasy land of the ocean and what I got was a fantastic atrocity. I was so relieved when it finally ended. What an incredible disappointment...and not only that, but what an affront to art this is! I give this movie a 2 only because it is visually nice to look at at times, otherwise I'd give it a 1.",2,5,6,26 April 2020
Megamind," An Amazing Childrens Movie That Adults Will Enjoy Too
","This movie is really great. It is a play on the concepts of good and evil, hero and villain, and is good for children and adults alike. There is humor for both young and old folks, and lessons for both too. The story is really well done, the acting is perfect...its just a really well done movie! It even inspired a new business card idea for me.",10,2,2,9 December 2019
Interstellar," The Most Important Film Ever Made!
","This movie is the most important film ever made, and I mean that.First lets start with the basic premise of this movie which I hope it creates awareness about, which is the idea that the planets resources may very well some day be depleted. And then what?This film is directed by Christopher Nolan, one of the greatest directors of all time next to Francis Ford Coppola and the Coen Brothers. And this is his greatest work of art. And with it comes a handful of the best actors out there.This film explores all of the deepest topics in existence. Time, space, relativity, deep space travel and searching for other planets that could sustain life, how that kind of travel could be possible, how that kind of travel and living on other planets would effect how time passes for the space travelers, how they would age differently than loved ones back home and how that would effect their relationship emotionally, how gravity is related to time and other fascinating theories in physics, and this movie even explores what it might look like inside of a worm hole, black hole, and the fifth dimension!And whats more is that they had a team of the worlds leading physicists consulting with them on the film to make sure that all of the physics portrayed in the film are 100% accurate down to a 'T'. They even released an entire textbook about it afterwords! This movie is more educational than your average documentary, and yet it is not a documentary, it is some of the greatest storytelling you will ever experience.This movie very elegantly connects themes of existentialism/life/death, philosophy/metaphysics/spirituality, physics, relationships/emotions, the future of our world and the universe at large in the most artful cinematic way. It will literally warp your mind and leave you feeling different for the rest of the day. This movie is just so intellectual and so emotional...it is one of the most cerebral experiences you may ever have. It will provoke so many different thoughts and feelings while you watch it, it is just phenomenal. In fact it made me cry more than any movie ever has (I cried 4 times when I first saw it, and I still always cry hard at the end every time).And this movie is so visually stunning, the shots of outer space and different planets are just breath taking. You will really feel like you are in space with them and will be completely absorbed in the movie, and afterwards the world you return to will seem bleak in comparison. It is such an incredible work of art.I rarely ever want to see movies more than once. This movie I saw 4 times in the theater when it came out. I've never done that before, but for all these reasons and more, I just couldn't stop watching it. Then I bought it on DVD and keep watching it again and again since. This movie is literally out of this world. It is a must see for everyone. It is the most important movie of all time. I'd give it at least 11 stars out of 10.",10,0,3,31 December 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," This Movie Blew My Mind! So Much Intensity!
",This movie blew my mind so much! There was intense moment after intense moment. It was so incredibly visceral. There were several times my jaw just dropped and I stared at the screen completely dumbfounded. I'm a film connoisseur and I've never seen a movie like this. It's just amazing. A dark masterpiece.,10,0,2,31 December 2019
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A Great Film
",This movie is really impressive. And exciting! I think it is a must see for everyone. Really makes you think while keeping you on the edge of your seat. In fact I found the climax so enthralling that I kept watching it over and over and over again! There's parts that just gave me chills I loved it so much I had to keep seeing it!,8,0,0,9 December 2019
Midsommar," A Beautiful Masterpiece About Ancient Viking Paganism
","I just finished watching the directors cut version which is 3 hours long and I absolutely loved ever single moment of it. What a beautiful work of art. I can't believe that this has gotten any bad reviews at all. Or that people have said that it is just like wicker man. This film only has one thing in common with wicker man and that is it. That's like saying that any christian film is the same as any other because it involves some aspect of christianity. So please do not let any of those reviews deter you, those people are obviously extremely narrow minded and have no appreciation for the art of film. Because this film shows that art at its greatest.This film is an absolute masterpiece. Ever scene is made with the most ultimate of film making artwork, making every second of every scene mesmerizing. It is amazing how they were able to create such a beautiful film that was ultimately centered around the darkest of ancient viking rituals involving things such as drug use, manipulation and seduction, ritual suicide, fertility/sex magick, and even human sacrifice. Of course the film does take some artistic liberties, these rituals were not practiced exactly the way it depicts. But there is some true history there, and it is amazing to see these ancient traditions brought to life and portrayed so artfully. And it is also great to see the experience of being on psychedelic drugs depicted so accurately, as usually it is not.Of course this movie is not for everyone. It is very long, and is slower than most blockbusters. And there are a few parts that are deeply disturbing. So if you do not have enough of an appreciation of film that you will actually be able to see the amount of artwork that has gone into every scene, there's no point in you sitting through this 2.5 hour long film. But if you are an appreciator of film and know good art when you see it, and won't get too traumatized by a few disturbing scenes, I think you will be extremely impressed with this film and should see it. Especially if you enjoy the topic of paganism. If you are someone who likes the show Vikings, or movies like 'A Dark Song' you will probably really love this.",10,3,14,11 May 2020
Once Upon a Time in America," A Good Movie, But Too Long & Disturbing
","This movie is good...could be great...but it is just way too long and it is also too disturbing. It is 4 hours long, which would be find if that time wasn't filled with excessive gazing and staring off into space, and scenes where it just felt like the movie was taking a long pause. So much of it really needed to be edited out, the film really should be half as long.And whats more, is that there are 2 rape scenes in the movie. And done by the main character, not a villain, but someone who you are otherwise supposed to be empathizing with. One of these scenes is very disturbing as well. I really think that the film could do without all of that. So if you are going to watch this do so at your own risk.",6,0,15,30 January 2020
The Untouchables," A 10 For Film Making, 1-2 For Accuracy
","This is a beautifully filmed movie. The shots and camera work are just so great. The cinematography and film making are also great. I would give all that a 10. Film wise, its a wonderful film.But this is a true story, told in a completely inaccurate way. To me it defeats the purpose. Maybe with ancient legends you can take a lot of liberties. But this is the retelling of recent history. And they are doing so much wrong in retelling it. So many of the details are false...there may very well be more falsehoods than truth in the movie. And we are talking about some very big things too. For instance two of the officers who are working together in the film never actually met! And the worst part is that they have the main character kill a man in the movie who he didn't kill in real life, but instead went on to replace al capone as head of his family and then eventually died of natural causes. Where they hell do they get off doing that? What they should have done, if they had the integrity, would be to say that that is what happened after al died at the end of the film. After they say how long al served in jail and how he died...but they don't do any of that! The movie ends with al going to jail, not knowing what happened after that. A very poor ending.So I give this movie a 1-2 for accuracy. Altogether I give it a 6. Worth watching only if you watch it alongside a documentary on al capone so you know whats what.",6,0,2,6 January 2020
Bram Stoker's Dracula," An Absolute Masterpiece. One of The Greatest Films Of All Time
","This film is an absolute and utter masterpiece. It is definitely one of the greatest films of all time. The artwork in this film is absolutely breathtaking. You won't see such amazing cinematography in hardly any other movie. It is just unparalleled. Each shot in this film is so beautiful, any of them could be taken as a photograph and put up in a gallery. But of course this is to be expected when you have such an amazing director as Francis Ford Coppola doing a film. And he does it totally true to the original story, unlike any of the other Dracula movies. The art of this film should be taught in film schools. If you are a film connoisseur or just someone who wants to see a truly impressive masterpiece, this is it.",10,0,4,20 October 2019
Black Panther," There's Nothing Good About This...& It's Affirmative Action At It's Worst
","There is literally nothing good about this movie. When I saw the commercials and learned of the premise I really wanted to like it too. I mean the whole idea of a African-esque mythology/mysticism based super hero movie was almost too good to be true for me, because I am actually very into African Shamanism & Folklore. I was so enthused for this movie that I tried watching it three separate times. But every time I tried watching it the results were the same. Every scene was excruciating to watch, and I couldn't suffer through more than 20 minutes or so, it was just so bad.As I said, there is nothing good about this movie. And that includes every aspect of the film making. The writing, the acting, the directing, the production, they are all complete crap. They are literally so bad that it is surreal.What this movie is is one of the biggest works of over-dramatization of all time. This film is more over-dramatized than I have ever seen anything ever be, including Aquaman, and that is saying a lot. It is the same style of unrealistically overdone writing and acting you would see in a B movie, but when a super overdone production as well. The movie looks like it costs more than any movie ever made, but it sounds and plays like it was written and directed by high schoolers. It is so bad that every scene and every bit of dialogue was just so over the top and forced that it was painful to watch and listen to. It's just not natural. People don't talk and act like that. And story's don't happen that way. Its utterly ridiculous.The only reason this movie was made in the first place, and was so 'acclaimed' by whatever idiots thought it was good, is because of affirmative action 'black power' aspect. This movies aforementioned african folklore style of storytelling and theme, and its all black ensemble made it a SJW statement that anyone who considers themselves a democrat, liberal, activist, etc would have to declare is the best movie of the year...for the purpose of promoting affirmative action for black people. But this is a movie, and we need to judge it as a movie. And as a movie, it is not at all good in any way. Objectively speaking, if you were to replace the all black cast with a cast that was all white, and all of the SJW's didn't look through the black power promotion lens at it, it would have never gotten good ratings. Because it may very well be one of the worst movies of all time. And that is coming from someone who has seen thousands of them and studied them. So I am not making that statement lightly. Like I said, I tried watching this one 3 times. So I certainly have enough perspective here and am not being small minded.It would be much better to promote black artists/art by promoting the best of it. You cannot simply applaud a movie that is absolutely terrible just because it has only black people in it. These are adults, not toddlers. They should have the same standards to live up to as the rest of the film industry.",1,3,4,6 April 2020
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," One Of The Most Honest & Intelligent Movies About Love, Romance & Relationships
","As a man, I am obviously not a fan of romance movies like women are. The reasons why most men do not enjoy them are obvious, most of them are made for women, thus they pander to women and make the movies all too girly, and in addition they make them unintelligent and cliche and generic.This movie is the opposite of all of that. While it is romantic in its use of artwork, it is not girly. It is a highly intelligent, sophisticated and brutally honest look at romance, love and relationships, the way we experience it in the real world of dating, not the way most hollywood movies portray.Of course you need a film mastermind like Woody Allen to portray this. And this, to me as a film buff, is his masterpiece. I consider this to be his best film. It is so eloquently written and directed. Some films are works of art. But this is fine art.And he couldn't do it without the all star cast he lines up for it however. Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz and Scarlette Johansen star in this film in some of the most lovable roles of their careers.And this film goes where no other films dare to go, at least not seriously (some late night comedies do, but in a comical way, this of course is different). This film explores the very complicated concept of polyamory and its complex dynamics. That is dating multiple people at the same time. For in this film 3 women fall in love with the same man, each with a different type of relationship with him, and each other. As a social scientist this movie was a delightful exploration of the social dynamics in dating and relationships.And the romantic artistic portrayal of the depth of these emotional situations and relationships and the complexity of it all is just so charming. Especially with the narration. But this movie is not just a feel good movie. It exposes all of the parts of love and these relationship dynamics that most of us people who believe in love, (especially us polyamorists who believe in it in abundance), do not like to talk about and face.Through the characters having to process their own romantic feelings, it helps you to process them as well. Something most dumbed down romance movies just do not offer you. Nor do they offer you the level of art that this one does as well. So this is a movie that any Romance genre loving female will like, but which any intelligent man will enjoy as well.In fact I believe this is the best romance film ever made. An easy 10. And a must see for any film lover.",10,0,1,31 December 2019
Heat," Perhaps The Most Intense Heist Thriller Out There
","This movie may very well be the most intense heist thriller out there. It will put you on the edge of your seat and make you sweat. One of the heist scenes in this movie is such an intense scene that I always remember it, and sometimes look it up when I need a good thrill. This movie is incredibly well done, a very good story, great writing, great acting, great film making. And it also has an interesting ending too. A 10, must see.",10,0,0,30 January 2020
What We Do in the Shadows," Ideal Mockumentary
","If you enjoy mockumentaries such as The Office and Parks & Rec, this is the perfect mockumentary for you. This is a documentary parody about vampires! Done by a couple of the guys from The Flight Of The Conchords hit comedy show on HBO, this documentary style film is the awkward satire you love. Artfully crafted nuanced uncomfortably awkward situations abound in this parody of vampire movies. It is an intelligent and interesting humor that is very unique and different from anything you have ever encountered. This film is highly entertaining and a lot of fun.",10,1,2,14 March 2020
Sin City," FILM NOIR AT ITS BEST! A MASTERPIECE
","For those who don't know what film noir is, it means dark film. It was one of the first genre's of film back when they were black and white. The murder mystery type. It's one of the first thing's that film students study in film school, if not the first. It set the stage for all of film back in the 20's and 30's. And since then has been lost, so that most people do not even know the phrase.That genre has returned in all of its former glory and more here in this glorious masterpiece. Sin City is a serious work of art. It's new shades and textures of black and white with little splashes of color here and there are just beautiful and entrancing.The movie is mysterious, inspiring, compelling, violent, shocking, romantic, poetic, glorious, and of course very dark. Robert Rodriguez is an incredible director who has done a lot of great action movies, but this work is revolutionary to say the least.It comprises a set of 4 different sub stories within it, each which intersect in the middle and each which will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Each one is an amazing story in and of itself that has a great beginning, middle and end. When you put them all together, what you get is just incredibly epic. So epic that it will literally blow your mind and make it hard for you to return to the real world after.Of course it helps that this movie has one of the greatest line ups of all time in it. Each one of the stories within it has several huge actors in it, both stars and character actors. You will see all of your favorite actors in some of the most animated roles they have ever played. It is a such a treat.This movie is like taking a powerful drug for any film students or connoisseurs or people who really love film. It is a really powerful experience I know you will enjoy. 10 stars easy.",10,1,1,31 December 2019
