Hereditary," An utter mess of a film, a waste of 2 hours. One of the worst films I've seen.
","This film is neither well made nor scary.The story is a mish mash of cobbled together ideas, badly worn out tropes and utterly unrelated things.By the 50 minute mark I found myself messaging people to ask if they had seen it and that I was bored, but by then I felt it must get better. It never does.I really do not understand the rave reviews, all I can assume is that they are from people who have never seen a real horror movie ever.The 'plot' revolves around an elderly lady dying, her daughter who for some unknown reason makes miniatures (and the film tries to make out these are important, but they aren't), her 2 children and husband. There is basically no sensible dialogue throughout.For some contrived reason the mother forces her 16 year old son (who looks 30) into taking the 12 year old daughter to a party. Where she ends up predictably coming into contact with nuts (the film rams the fact that the daughter has a nut allergy right at you a few scenes prior). This leads to the only good scene in the entire movie, which does make you gasp / cringe.After that nothing really makes any sense, and it all becomes very predictable (a seance, really... never saw that coming ...) which then leads to some odd 'demon' / 'god' thing taking over the mother, who then manages to be able to stick to the ceiling in a most unconvincing manner, as well as to be able to 'swim' across the scene... I think this is supposed to be scary, it's just laughable.The husband (Gabrielle Byrne) mostly looks like someone who cannot believe he is saying the things he is, or being told the things he is, and looks to be lamenting his career for most of the movie (then you realise he and Toni Collette actually backed it themselves, which explains how they got the lead roles), bursts into 1980s style flames...which do not even mark the immaculate wooden flooring.Then it ends, with totally unaccountable old age pensioner nudity, which bares no relation to anything that you've been watching.Toni Collette gives things a good go, but the dialogue is just crazy. Aunt Lydia from Handmaid's Tale turns up and leads the charge of the bleedin' obvious through the last portion.All in all, if you like horror, good films, good stories, good acting, good effects then avoid this garbage.My partner and I are still in shock that we stuck with it through to the end, neither can believe just how bad it was.",2,2,7,15 September 2018
