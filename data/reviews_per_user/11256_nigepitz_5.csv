Raiders of the Lost Ark," Hasn't aged well
","I have always loved this movie but haven't watched it for maybe 7 or 8 years and so I sat down to watch it with my wife who had never seen it. I was excited to see her reaction but it was mine that was the problem - it just looked cheesy, out of date, sexist and generally pants and I wondered what I ever saw in it. Shame",6,0,4,12 April 2020
Us," The worst film I have ever seen by a mile
","I struggled to see why 'Get Out' was so hyped and thought it was ordinary at best but this follow up by Peel actually made me angry. The first 20 minutes were ok and after that it was utter tosh. I would rate this in the worst five films I have seen in the 57 years of my existence and I have seen some stinkers. I hate mostly because it thinks it's so clever when it is run-of-the-mill story with the most obvious twist that you will see coming a mile away and which makes no logical sense. Whilst it's less racist than Peel's Get Out it has absolutely no other redeeming qualities. As in Get Out, the acting is like an Am Dram/ Hammer Horror mash up and the plot preposterous. When the 'look a likes' keep killing everyone in site, the subject family escape time and time again. Man, I hated this film.",1,2,5,29 May 2020
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Truly, one of the worst movies ever made
",What an absolute mess. JD gurning and grinning his way through an absolute shambles of a movie. Destroys everything that was good about the original. Both Roald and Gene must be turning in their graves,1,3,7,27 January 2020
The Holiday," What's not to like?
","Put together a great cast, good writing and acting and throw in some nostalgia and you have the perfect rom com. Makes you wonder why most Rom Coms fail so miserably when this formula seems so obvious. Anyone who scores this movie less than a 9 has no heart",9,0,0,8 July 2020
The Greatest Showman," So much better than expected
",I am not a big fan of musicals and had heard nothing but bad reviews (looking at you Mark Kermode) but loved it and how can you not love any movie with Huge Ackman?,9,0,0,29 May 2020
