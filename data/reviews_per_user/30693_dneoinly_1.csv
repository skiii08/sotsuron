The Avengers," Could have been terrible but, Joss Whedon worked his magic again.
","Brilliant Movie. Simple as. A lot of directors can learn from Joss Whedon. ...... MICHAEL BAY COMES TO MIND ha ha. It's a very very funny movie, with some great exciting action set pieces. 2 words 'HULK SMASH.' Can not wait for the inevitable sequel & the rest of the characters solo movies..............ESPECIALLY 'THE HULK.' The 3D wasn't really the best, hence the point dropped with my 9/10 rating. Said to my friend before we took our seats to this brilliant movie 'If Thor & The Hulk don't get into a scrap, I'm going to be disappointed.' & the movie did not disappoint. Excellent throw down between the 2 of them. STOP READING & GO SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY.",9,1,4,4 May 2012
