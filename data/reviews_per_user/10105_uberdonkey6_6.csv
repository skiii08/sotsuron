First Man," Aww man, bored
","I love science and astronauts but this is one dull film. From the first ten minutes I was bored. Maybe realistic and maybe it effectively conjures up the era, but why was a film with so little real drama made. The Farthest (2017 documentary about the voyager missions) is far far more exciting, and that's a documentary.",4,3,5,21 February 2019
Us," Drive by
","Just saw 'Us' and felt, with the acting and the filming etc it could have been an amazing film, but it just wasn't constructed properly. It's almost like there was a concept but it was rushed. Unlike 'get out' which was so iconic people still talk about the 'sunken place', this film was so close to being amazing, but drove past it.Worth watching, and some beautiful scenes, but the scenes don't tie in well enough to the film.. the build up to critical moments just doesn't exist. In a way, I wonder of this had been a series of 12 episodes, it would have been a much better tale. As it is, it's an ok movie with some interesting but mostly messy and unthreaded metaphors.",7,1,3,23 May 2019
Dreamgirls," Saturday afternoon musical spectacular
","In many ways I wish more time had been written over the story (it is a bit like a trailing story rolling through the lives of these 3/4 female singers). Also, the way the words of the songs they performed reflected so closely the situation in the film made it a bit cheesy and there was a period in the middle where there were just too many songs sung about what was happening, such that I was about to stop watching. In some ways I wish this had been done with similar songs, but not as a musical.The singing doesn't really reflect the period (more like beyoncé style ballads) however, this film has a lot of positive aspects..I absolutely hate Eddy Murphy and actively avoid all films he is in, but on this occasion I felt he was very good and filled the role perfectly. Jennifer Hudson is one of my favourite actresses, and she didn't disappoint, and she sung some stunning songs. Indeed, you really get your money's worth when it comes to the number of songs, and despite not having the most profound lyrics, some are very touching and make up for the weak depth of the story (and this weird superficial reference to the civil rights movement and I think Vietnam, but it never really became part of the film).It is maybe targeted at 18-25 year old women, especially beyoncé fans, who will love this film. As a 42 year old man, despite being bored in parts, and despite the above criticisms, and despite the fact that I will forget the film by tomorrow, at the end I can say I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and it was a real Saturday afternoon pleasure. You don't have to think, the women are beautiful, some nice songs, and it did make me cry at the end.",7,0,0,9 March 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Lacking a strong story
","Ok, so I'm not a Tarantino fan. The guy loves film, and loves references to film and to 20th Century pop culture. So, the film meanders around for 2hrs, with lots of extended scenes of people driving too fast to parties or home in tiny stylish open top cars. It seems like most of the scenes were irrelevant to any story line but were a self-indulgent delve in to some semi-historic events so that Tarentino could reminisce. The final ten minutes were a twist on an actual event in Holywood, and was probably the nub of an otherwise plotline free film. Had Bad Pitt and Leonardo de Caprio not been the stars, it would have been an exceptionally dull film. However, this film showed they both have an amazing screen presence with Brad literally being engrossing even when he's just opening a can of dog food.The question is, was it a film? If I had been editing it, it would probably be 20 minutes long, the rest contributes nothing to the story. Thus, it's more like an extended mockumentary on 60s Hollywood but with no real thread.",5,0,4,5 December 2019
War Machine," Subtley clever and well written film
","This film is about war, but it isn't heavy; it's about politics, but it isn't difficult to follow; it's about an anguished personality, but the film is light.The same film could have been made as a guy wrenching and bloody film with lots of emotional build up - but it wasn't, and I'm glad for that. It tackles a serious subject: the war in Afghanistan and all its associated difficulties. But it does it in an original accessible way that isn't looking for cheap emotional reactions. Not really 'humorous' bit certainly light, though for me it just made it that much better because in our minds we know that these soldiers and the civilians went through a difficult and confusing time. Having been friends with a special forces Pathfinder serving there, it drew on the real problems they faced, but it informa and doesn't milk the audience for cheap emotional responses. So Brad Pitt comes over as a charicature, but it fits the film. Definitely a great attempt at portraying some really important concepts relating to war, in a way that is quite light and original.",9,1,2,6 September 2018
Joker," Disappointing
","Whilst the acting was fine (maybe not subtle enough to be great) it wasn't a particularly gripping film and made me wonder what the hype was about. Maybe unique in trying to introduce a comic book viewing audience into a less action packed and slightly more serious film. I guess such audiences may describe it as 'mature' or 'deep' but an adult with moderately broad movie tastes certainly wouldn't. Maybe worth a watch, but don't go out of your way.",6,6,13,5 December 2019
