"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," More to it than meets the eye
","Actually not really, but what would you expect with a title like that? It does depend on what you think of Simon Pegg and things like him being exhausted after 10 seconds of running. Also his 'wardrobe' and the 'handling' of it during certain scenes. Low level humor is what you could call it and depending on your mood or taste, you will like it or you won't like it at all.Simon Peggs character is also not the 'biggest' of them all. I haven't watched any of those 'Biggest Loser' shows, but I do know there is a difference between the people in that show and what Simon Pegg is having (on his bones). Having said that, not all the jokes work, but it's decent overall.",6,0,1,21 June 2016
Ford v Ferrari," Who's better?
","I have to admit, I never thought that a movie about cars/racing would get to me, the way this movie did. And it is a testament not just to the actors, but the script and the directing and so many other things that make this quite the experience to watch.Bale is quite the actor - I should have known or rather remembered he's British, but I really had forgotten about it, especially with his ability to blend his American accent so good, you just can't tell. But it is not just about accents, it is about gravitas and even more surprisingly about humor! The movie is way funnier than I expected it to be, with one liners coming at you at the speed of ... well you get it.And yes there are cliches and some things surely are exaggerated for good measure and to heighten certain things, but overall this is quite enchanting and quite a great movie. With not just one battlefield, if you'll excuse the use of that word, but multiple ones our main characters have to endure and maybe even prevail (?) - if you are aware of history, you know what's up, I didn't",10,1,3,24 March 2020
The King's Speech," Royal achievements
","While I'm not always on the same page (and I'm not alone in this) when it comes to the Oscars, I think they got it right this time. The filmmakers and actors may not have planned this (and how can you, even if some are saying this had 'Oscars' written all over it from the get-go), it is easy to see why it pleased the Academy (still the swearing is almost surprising, even if performed in a comedic way, you just don't expect it) and won them over.Acting wise and story wise (though I haven't checked how accurate it is, in portraying the events that really occurred) this is top notch. A perfect mix of comedy and drama. :o)",9,2,4,17 December 2011
Despicable Me 2," Still despicable
","The first Despicable movie was better, no doubt about it. But this still is a funny continuation of the story. While Steve Carells (animated) character has sworn off his evil ways, he still has not lost everything that made him so (un)charming in part 1. Add to that a few new voice member and the ever reliable source of minions and you get a really good comedy mix.The story/premise is simple and predictable, but that is not why you'd watch this movie. Aimed still at kids (with a lot references to older movies for the grown ups, classics such as Body Snatchers and more) this is entertainment and should reviewed as such. Enjoy",8,0,0,1 September 2013
Insidious: Chapter 2," Continuation
","This movie starts exactly where the other one left off. So it would make sense for you to have watched part 1. It does work without it, because everything gets sort of explained, but it would be better if you had the knowledge already while watching. The movie sets out and tries to get the viewers it had from part 1 and it does succeed.The really out there ending from part 1 gets referenced here and kinda mirrored, but what really works is the story and the scares it does deliver because of that. Some people criticized the actors, but I'd argue they are really good. Not because of their names, but because they can and do act in this one. Not as good as Conjuring, but far better than other horror movies (with or without blood ... this one being one of the latter).",7,0,0,5 June 2014
The Lobster," Absurd and funny (?)
","Someone described this as screwball, but I reckon they got confused a bit. Otherwise the review wasn't bad about the movie, a movie that is awkward, strange and absurdist to say the least. And for some I reckon it will be boring. Because it's not obvious comedy most of the time. It's fun in the strange, in the not normal form.Things that will make you shake your head in disbelief and ideas that you will find strange, either in a good/funny sense or in a 'I don't like that' kind of way. That all depends on your sense of humor and I'm pretty sure even on your mood while watching this. Try to be as open minded as possible and you may enjoy this. If not, you better stop it early on, because the movie does keep its tone throughout ...",8,1,3,25 December 2016
Moneyball," On the money(ball)
","When the credits began to roll, I was like: Of course it was Aaron Sorkin. I should have known. While according to IMDb he didn't write it alone (I guess he was the last to 'temper' with the script), I'm pretty sure he had his hands on most of the dialogue in the movie. Really great stuff. And whoever thought Jonah Hill can't do anything ... well watch this movie and start believing.Of course the bigger name is Brad Pitt and he shows his love for the game by really sticking to this concept and getting it made in the first place (the four credited writers here are an indication that it took some time to get it off ground). Even a side-/sub-story that get thrown in halfway through the movie does not really temper with the mood or distract you too much (which was something I was afraid of, when Robin Wright came into the 'play').Don't watch it though if you wanna see the game itself. There is not much of that happening. But the movie does not need any of the sports scenes to work. It works perfect as it is ...",9,1,2,29 March 2012
The Avengers," If they can't save the box office, they sure as hell will avenge it
","I'm still having my fingers crossed that the Avengers will overtake Avatar as the most successful movie ever (until another movie burst and takes over that is). It would be such a great success and I would be so happy for Joss Wheddon. A real nerd amongst filmmakers he has made it big time. As we speak Avengers has broken quite a few records already and it is on a good roll. And all that is more than deserved. While I don't think it is necessary to have watched the other Marvel movies so far (especially not the different Hulks), the Avengers will make you want to watch more (look at your local video store for confirmation!).All the characters are here and have their moments. Maybe Thor is the one that gets a bit shorthanded time wise. But then again, he is god, so he wouldn't care anyway. Mark Ruffalo is winning (as a Charlie Sheen would say) with his performance as Hulk/Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is entertaining as ever. And even if some claim that Captain America is not needed, I think he brings Gravitas and is more than valuable to counter the jokes of an Iron Man and bring some much needed bonding to the whole Crew. Chris Evans is perfect for that role.The movie has been criticized for the weak villain. I think that does injustice to the movie. While the characters (bar Hulk?) have been introduced to you, this still is a forming of a group. It is more about the Avengers, than it is about any villain. And I don't think Tom H. Loki is that weak (even if Hulk does disagree).I watched the movie twice now and I enjoyed it both times. Time flies by and you don't realize how fast 150 minutes can go by. I like the fact, that Joss does not treat the viewer as if he were stupid. So maybe some will not get the joke/bet between Capt. Americas character and Sam Jacksons character (though I reckon it won't be many), but I loved that the movie did not make a big deal out of it.Since this is a Marvel movie, you should know by now that there is a tag scene coming at the end. A friend of mine knew immediately what (or rather who) we saw there. You'll find the answer on the internet. That scene came in between the credits. There is another scene after the credits which as of yet, was not shown in Europe, but will hopefully make its way onto a digital release (DVD, Blu Ray or whatever comes next). I'm so looking forward to it ... oh and the 3D is nice, but its the story/characters and everything else that will sell you to the movie ...",9,5,13,7 June 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Sequelitis
","This tries to stay in the flavor of the first installment of the National Treasure series, but doesn't really succeed. It doesn't fail either (apart from ridiculous threads in the plot, but then again this isn't meant to be taken too seriously so why bother caring about plot and stuff?), especially if you think about the (new) cast (members). Particular one female addition puts some acting weight into the mix, that wasn't available in the first part.While that is a very good thing, it does stir away from of the better things from part 1! Our comedy relief guy. Not only does he get fewer jokes, but some of them aren't as good as his previous (part 1 again) ones, which leaves you kind of bedazzled and yearning for a bit of better entertainment/fun.So successful though, that a part 3 is planned ... Well let's hope it will be an improvement this time around (three's a lucky charm ain't it?)",5,0,0,10 July 2008
Blade Runner 2049," Slow and beautiful
","I guess if the producers wanted to make another Blade Runner, they totally succeeded - at least so far. As with the original Blade Runner the visuals are the ones that people will refer to when it comes to this movie. And it's not just because of the Academy Awards. You can tell all by yourself and I reckon even without having seen it on an IMAX screen (though I would have recommended it and still am).Having said all that, the movie has also the same irritating feeling about it, that the original Blade Runner had. So in almost every aspect it is a successor to it. Story wise obviously too, though I guess this one has a couple of shorts that play before this movie, that are supposed to get you in the mood. They are not necessary to watch, but they are also very well made. This movie is an experience and it is one you have to be willing to make.While it does have some action scenes, while it is Science Fiction, it does play more like a slow moving drama with a lot of mystery elements to it. If that sounds intriguing to you, with some added social commentary flavor, than by all means watch it. But beware that you have to have patience with it ...",9,5,11,10 March 2018
Million Dollar Arm," Arming
","Or 'Arm(y) of one'? Which would be factually incorrect, but you catch the drift. I was surprised at the movies beginning but it did make sense, because this is as much a story about a manager than it is about baseball or the dream of making it there (especially for the characters/people who try it here). It's a little bit like Jerry McGuire if you look at the story.It does have great actors to support the story and the characters of course. And it's not like we don't know where this is going (we do know)! I'm not big on baseball, but it is the human story that will entice you, if you let it.",7,0,0,2 February 2015
Angels & Demons," Nice rhythm
","This movie flows nicely and has a good rhythm to it. Which makes it slightly better than the 'Da Vinci Code', if you like your movies to be simple and/or straightforward. Whereas Da Vinci was more complex and therefor not entirely satisfying for the mainstream audience it was targeting, this one knows exactly what it wants.I haven't read the books, the movies are based on, but as it appears the movies took some liberties. Angels and Demons as a book is a 'prequel' to the Da Vinci Code, but here it is played out as a (sort of) Sequel. Tom Hanks reprises his role and the hunt begins early on. The pace picks on and it never really slows down, which is good, because then you would start thinking and you would see many flaws ... As it is, the movie is solid in what it tries to achieve.",7,2,8,15 August 2009
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Appetizer
","A pretty long appetizer that is. For its length it doesn't feel dragged or anything, but I still wonder if it was necessary. OK, so character motivation, other people can show off a bit of what they have going for them and the is no Hunger Games going on (it'd be really crazy to do the same movie for a third time, not that people wouldn't watch it though). I only read the first book and I thought that was made in a good fashion (especially considering the narration it had). Not sure how the other two books are built up, but this movie feels like a filler, something to keep you on 'hold' until you get served the real deal/meal.It'll be in a couple of months from now, so let's see how they bring it to an end and if P.S. Hofmann already had done his scene before his premature departure (may he rest in peace). The scenes here seemed to have been shot alright before that. Now: Let's conclude this already!",6,2,10,31 May 2015
Vertigo," Miss Leading
","Quite a few famous things happen here. One of them being the shot - zoom doing the opposite of the camera movement and therefor giving us quite a dizzy sequence. We start with a chase and ... well we never get a full resolve of that chase. It just sets up something - which also sets up that it sets up how the story is being told.This may sound complicated and maybe you dissaprove of how Hitchcock went on to make this movie (especially contrasting the first half of the film to the latter part of it) - but if you can dig it, if you can get behind it, you will enjoy this very crazy ride into human insanity, madness and obsesiveness. How and what would a happy ending be? And for whom would that resolve anything? Hitchcock is not always giving us all the answers we may crave for - but he knows what boxes to tick to keep us on the edge of the seat.",9,0,0,8 May 2020
Black Swan," Goose (bumps)
","For 2011, the movie I'm most looking forward to is 'Pirates 4' (and 'Your Highness'). For 2010 it was 'Inception' and 'Wall Street 2'. And while Inception did match my expectation, Wall Street wasn't quite as good as I hoped for (though it's not a bad movie either). And while I do know of quite a lot of movies that will come out in 2011, there is a chance, that there will be a movie there, that will catch me by surprise ... like Black Swan did in 2010.I am a fan of Aranofsky and I liked his other movies too. But I would never have guessed that Black Swan would have me caught up like it did. It is not a horror movie in a pure sense, but it does have quite a lot of moments of tension. And there is a sequence towards the end of the movie, that had me at the edge of my seat. Plus the goosebumps I am mentioning in the summary line (and the theater was heated!).While 'true' horror movies can make you 'jump out of your seat', by a music cue, this really did have a strong vibe in the entire sequence. Of course boiling it down to just that (great) sequence would do injustice to the rest of the movie. And the great acting at hand. While the story is not new, the sound design, the editing, the framing, the acting and everything that got put into this movie, works excellent in favor of it.If you had asked me in early December, I would have said Inception is my movie of the year 2010. But then I got the chance to watch Black Swan and I am truly amazed by this. Just talking about it, excites me and that has not happened in a long time. The Golden Globe Natalie Portman received is more than well deserved and only Fincher could have beaten Aranofsky (very clever script and a well earned Globe for Sorkin too). Seems like he (Aranofsky) has Midas touch then ...",10,4,10,18 January 2011
Changeling," Power Performance
","'Based on true ...' movies are a peculiar thing. Most of the times the strike a nerve with me ... the wrong one and I can't really get myself to like them. This one has of course a few advantages over other movies. Angelina Jolie for once (not only good looking, but also a good actress), but most importantly Clint Eastwood as a director. Clint shows us again that he has learned from the best.The story borderlines often 'kitsch' territory, but thankfully never crosses that line. While some film dramatics/dynamics effects are AWOL, this doesn't really effect the movie. A drama worthy your attention and your time.",8,4,6,26 April 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Another trilogy coming?
","I'm assuming you have seen the previous installments of the Pirates of the Caribean saga/franchise. If you have, you know that Keiras and Orlandos character will not return for this one. But apart from Johnny Depp there are other people who do return from previous movies and lighten up the movie with their trademark humour.How will you feel about this movie? It depends clearly on your love of the Jack Sparrow character (Captain, I know). If you like that character a lot, you will not mind a few faults here and there. If you are fixed on the fact, that Keira and Orlando are gone, you might as well not watch this, because you won't enjoy it as much.The media tried to push other people in the cast as new Orlando and new Keira. But don't expect this to happen either. A fun ride (not as fun as the very first Pirates movie of course), that will entertain you, if you keep an open mind and your heart open for the one and only ... Captain Jack Sparrow!",7,1,2,26 December 2011
Men in Black 3," No catchy song
","For some reason this didn't get a catchy song as the first two MIB movies did. Maybe Will Smith was too occupied doing other things (producing movies, looking after the career of his children and other stuff), but we don't get the treat of another memorable tune. Even if you didn't like the other MIB songs, you've got to admit, they stayed with you for awhile. But apart from this little 'omission', every other ingredient is here. With a little twist on our beloved Agent 'K' of course. If you've seen the trailer or read anything about the movie, you know what I'm talking about.Getting Josh Brolin here as a major player was a big thing and he really delivers. There is also a cameo of sorts, of a major character of the other two movies. But it's not a 'talking' part. Plus the usual 'Aliens' among us in-jokes we have to come to love (hopefully). But be warned of one thing: This might have a very strong beginning that stretched the PG-13 rating a bit, by being really brutal (for the rating that is)",7,1,3,16 July 2012
The New World," Otherworldly
","A new world indeed and a new Terence Malick picture (at least his most recent complete one). It is a very spiritual movie and it is moving at a really slow pace. Even a turtle and/or a snail would be offended by the pacing. Seriously though, you have to let yourself relax and breathe ... like the movie does.The newcomer Q'orianka who plays the main role here is great! She came to Berlin with the rest of the cast, to celebrate the movie at the Berline International Film Festival ... while she also had her birthday (she got 16 in 2006) and you never would've guessed it ... Women always seem more mature ... in fact they are ;o) Anyway her performance elevates the movie, although it is awfully difficult to feel empathy for any other character portrayed in the movie (it's obvious that it's the intention of Malick to give them flaws), that's why I didn't like this movie as much as I have previous Malick films (not that there are many mind you! ;o) If you can cope with the pace and the more than human characters, than you should watch this drama ...",7,0,1,20 April 2007
Frost_Nixon," Ready to Rumble
","Or 'Lightweight Championship Match with Heavyweight Contenders'. Both main actors do convince here in their roles. I'm guessing that almost everyone has heard about Nixon or at least his 'achievements'. Frank L. is mesmerizing as Nixon. So much, that you wish to see more of him. Although that might have taken the mystery around him. But when the 'characters' Nixon and Frost meet, it's always something special happening on the screen.The lesser roles are cast superb as well (see Sam Rockwell etc.) and even if you don't know much about the interviews that this movie is about (I didn't know either), you will be entertained. Which is mostly an achievement of the script, the direction and the acting. A movie that can be seen a bit like history lesson, but in a light and enjoyable kind of way. Of course some things seem fictionalized for entertainment value, but the core of the movie feels pretty real and I'm sure the makers tried to stay as close as possible to what happened (outside the tapings that is).",8,1,2,14 June 2009
Walk the Line," Just great
","Joaquin Phoenix deserved an Oscar for his portrayal, but it was just his bad luck. Not only did he have to compete against Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but also against the fact, that one year earlier Jamie Foxx had won an Academy Award for the portrayal of Ray Charles ... two Oscars in a row for playing in a biopic about a musicians life? Not a chance, although it would've been more than appropriate.I didn't know much about Johnny Cash, before I watched the movie, I have to admit, so I'm sure other people can comment on how accurate this depicts the real events. But still I was amazed by the life and struggle of this man. Watch it, if you can (-> have the time).",8,2,2,24 April 2007
Alien 3," Clean slate
","Seems like David Fincher would be able to do something completely different nowadays, than what they allowed him to do back then. Even the Special Edition I watched seems broken up in many ways and I suppose not exactly what he imagined doing. Many influences made this a mixed bag of a lot of things. Some actually work and there is enough suspense here. Not to mention an amazing cast too.But there are also inconsistencies all over the place. Going places and doing some back and forth. But having Ripley back (continues from Aliens, though don't expect others from that movie - for reasons shown in the first minutes during some interesting title sequence) really helps elevate the movie. There are many theories and there are many things made out of the Alien universe. But watching the original 4 movies is also a nice ride and can be enjoyed without any other knowledge that is.",7,0,0,19 May 2020
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A fine game it is
","While we have new ingredients (= actors/characters) such as the girl formerly having a tattoo and a new bad guy, we also still have our beloved Holmes/Watson duo. And by that I mean the same actors in the role. Jude Law and especially Robert Downey Jr. having a lot of fun again and it shows.Some other characters return and we have the 'vision' mode in the movie again (at least that's what I call it and I'm sure you know what I mean if you've seen the first guy Ritchie Holmes). Making the Holmes movies is not easy. There is not only a rich written history but also quite a few movies. I have to admit that I wasn't thinking of either. Ritchie managed to create a world (especially with the first entry into his Holmes saga), that can be seen as standalone.So if you liked the first one, you will like this one too. Even if you think you might be fed up by some of the neat tricks he's using or even if you expected Rachel McAdams to be back 'big' in this movie too.",8,1,3,28 March 2012
Gremlins," Happy
","I mean really happy that this movie was made. And we can thank Steven Spielberg for that. If he hadn't put his name up, this movie might not have been made at all! The effects people weren't that happy, because it was more than difficult to make the puppets (Gremlins) move/give them emotions!You all know the 3 rules: Don't talk about Gremlins, don't ... ;o) Seriously though: Don't make them wet, don't expose them to bright light (especially sun light) and don't give them food after midnight! Now these rules come back to haunt you and/or the scriptwriter in part 2, but more about that in another review (for part 2 of course) ...Although it's lighter than originally intended (the Gremlins were supposed to eat people, if I remember the statements of the director correctly or do other horrible stuff), there are still some nasty stuff in there. But you don't have to worry, it's nothing your kid will be offended by! ;o)One of the best scenes of the movie is, when Phoebe talks about why she hates Christmas! The studio wanted that scene out, but Dante (director) fought for it and Spielberg helped him out (although he too didn't understand the motivation for that scene) ... Now go on and watch/buy the second one (if you don't already have)!",7,1,3,23 April 2007
The Incredible Hulk," Mean Green Machine
","After the disaster a few years ago (and I didn't even criticize the movie for it's lackluster CGI or the few action scenes it had, but you can read that in my 'Hulk' comment somewhere else), Hulk finally arrived! This won't be the best movie you've ever seen, nor might it be the ultimate comic to film version, but it more than delivers on it's premise.You don't have to have watched Ang Lees Hulk to get into this movie, to understand it. There's a short intro, that does look a bit like it sums up the things that happened in 'Part 1', although officially that movie won't be mentioned I guess. Ed Norton does know in what kind of movie he's in and plays it fairly straight. The (love) relationships work so much better and in more levels than those from Ang Lees Hulk, which didn't work at all.Of course the CGI has evolved and is up to another standard here. There is the odd cameo here and there (nicely done) and if you're an avid fan of the comics you will be more than pleased (as my friend who is a big fan unlike myself, told me)! But even if you're not into the comics, there's a great action movie to be seen here (with a slight addition of drama, just enough to not hurt the action part, but kind of elevate it).",8,2,3,18 August 2008
The Monuments Men," Missed opportunity
","I get why a lot of people are disappointed. There is a great story hidden here (no pun intended). Unfortunately it is not discovered by any qualified Monuments Man. And it's a shame because the story itself is more than amazing. And then you look at the cast and you think 'How could this go wrong?'. Well if you watch it, you can see where it goes wrong from time to time.It does work sometimes and the suave performance from most of the guys gives it a special flair. It could and should have been more, considering this is about saving art, you'd be excused if you thought it is a bit ironic. Whatever your take on it, you can a bit of fun with it, if you let yourself.",6,0,0,5 August 2014
Mission: Impossible III," A bad ending can spoil all the fun ...
","Or most of it. Don't get confused by the word 'spoil' in the summary line. I won't tell you anything about the movie that will spoil it for you.The movie begins pretty good, you have the team element in it, as you had in the TV series, you also can see a/the private life of Ethan Hunt (Cruise). The pace is good and although I haven't yet watched the TV show 'Alias', I was told that there a lot of parallels ...Very early in the film you get sucked into it, just because JJ Abrams is good at making you believe in his 'world' (or let's say in his vision). That's not a reality based world, with all the gadgets and stuff, but you're drawn to it. The great actors are a part of that. Most of them are very good ... there's one character I don't like, but I won't tell you which one that is ... if you see the movie, you might feel the same ... or maybe not ... Doesn't matter ... what matters is, what you think about the ending ... and for it was too much and to tell you the truth it (almost completely) ruined a good movie for me ...",6,1,2,4 April 2007
Your Name.," Switching
","You get thrown into this and you have to figure out what is what. Unless you know the source material and/or read synopsis of the movie of course. I hadn't so some of the stuff came as a surprise but there is a lightness at the beginning of it, which switches or changes gear throughout the movie. I wouldn't go as far as to say 'forget Disney'. There's a different audience and a different feel to this movie for sure, why not have both? Instead of viewing something negatively take in the positive.Animation is not everyones cup of tea, but if you have no issues with it, this is quite the ride with two characters and a lot of fantasy and drama thrown into the mix. It really is something and the repurcussions are felt ... and heavy",8,7,11,19 July 2019
Captain Phillips," Keeping it real (?)
","This is based on a real story, but the crew from back then did not get tired trying to tell people that Tom Hanks version of the captain of the title is made making him look better than he actually was. That is something that I cannot comment on since I haven't read too much about what actually happened back then. Whatever the case, this is not a documentary and the movie does a good job creating a very suspenseful environment.The villains might feel a bit over the top and there is another movie (more a documentary) that actually paints a better picture of how pirates operate or what their thinking and general life is, but this has no time to deal with that either. So while you could make a case against this movie (easily), you could also just sit back and enjoy a movie that only wants to entertain first and just put a little onto the situation ...",7,1,3,14 June 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pressure
","Not only to write a comment about movies like this one (because many love them, at least as many as that loathes them), but especially and more importantly for George Lucas to make this movie. It's one of the damned if you do, damned if you don't situations, you wouldn't like to be a part of! So even if I don't think this is a great movie (CG is very good here too, although you might be distracted from CG characters if you've seen them as Muppets, in previous films, such as Yoda), the Saga had to start somehow. And because the pressure was so high and many people didn't think it delivered, they looked for a culprit! And they found themselves one in the (CG) face of one Jar Jar Binks. He's an easy target indeed, but was invented for family value only. Still Lucas took the (Jar Jar) criticism seriously in his next installments ... Chewbacca he wasn't!",5,1,3,20 May 2007
Conquest 1453," Battle of Faith/Fetih
","Certainly not a battle for historical accuracy. The Americans have done it countless times though. Mostly with history in general and rewriting it, to fit into the dramatic purpose of a movie. So why shouldn't Turkey be allowed to do it? And why shouldn't you be allowed to enjoy this romp? There is no reason why not. Of course, you have to love clichés and the good vs. bad fight. There is no Grey area. If you're looking for a morality tale, you got the wrong movie.The action scenes are decent, the CGI is OK (not good, but it shouldn't distract you too much), but the letdown are the one dimensional characters. And some really bad screen writing. There is one 'bad' spy in the movie who couldn't be more obvious, if he wore a Byzantin flag singing 'I'm a spy' while having 'Spy' written on his forehead! But if that floats your boat (no pun intended), than go ahead. Also the heroics are incredible to the point, where either your teen fan-boy will emerge or your intellect will shut down.I liked the cinematography though and if you don't care about facts/history or that information gets repeated a couple of times (movie could've been a lot shorter) or that the Vatican speaks fluent Turkish (can be a bit distracting I guess for some) or that neither Robocop nor the Terminator would be a match against a special Turkish soldier or some other minor (major?) things that can be annoying: You could actually enjoy this nonsense. There is a scene involving a flag towards the end ... it has to be seen to be believed (and laughed at!).One thing it has shown us: Blockbusters have arrived in Turkey (for better or worse).

Sucker Punch," Can you dig it, Sucker (Punch)?
","I won't say anything about the ending, but I will talk about the structure of the film. So while there are no big spoilers here (I'm sure there is more to read on the summaries), I want to make sure, that people who don't want to know anything about the movie, won't read this.Having said that, let me first tell you that my summary line is quote from a Wrestler (Booker T), that I added the punch to. Of course as many have stated here, this is a love it or hate it film. And I have heard quite a few complaints about the film. One thing that no one has complained about, is the visual style of the film (unless they are not into the CG background that is).But the story itself was always something people were arguing about. And while the story within a story isn't too complicated (almost like an Alice in Wonderland, but with more power and more consequences), it did put people off. I liked the approach and I liked what Snyder did here. I admire him visually, but also tonally for having the guts to go places and do things, that you might not expect. Genre-wise in general and in this movie in particular.",8,3,5,18 December 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Actually it's not OK
","I'm assuming you have seen the trailer for the movie (though I guess most don't even care for that, so most reviews will mention what I do, without a 'warning'), so there is no spoiler in here for you. I'm going to tackle a few things that it reveals (of course in the movie in a bigger scale), that are just insane.While I thought the first Twilight movie was exactly what it promised to be (a wet teenage girls dream, literally in both senses), the subsequent movies (and I assume books, though I haven't read them) seem to lose their focus. While even with the first one I was sure someone ripped of Buffy and mixed it with OC (or any other soap that has beautiful people in it for that matter), I'm not sure what this latest installment is trying to do.Except having a very bad message for teenage girls (target audience!). It promotes violent intercourse as is obvious by the trailer and even more apparent in the movie. It is also pro Life, in a way that puts Rosemarys Baby into shame. And all the way through you get the pain (maybe even physical) through your bones. Irrational seeming decisions and longing looks make this seem like a parody in itself. But it never quite achieves to really amuse you (although 'Vampires Suck' couldn't achieve that either).So while there are still fans out there (and they will strongly disagree with me), who know their books (I even got schooled on some interactions that are only hinted at in the movie), this is a real dangerous movie for all the wrong reasons",2,5,6,19 March 2012
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Harry who?
","Out of the three leads of the Potter movies, Emma Watson might be the most talented. Actually she not only might be, she is! Proof can be found in this movie right here. She doesn't take the easy way out, that is for sure. But every actor in this elevates this. Even some of the scenes that are borderline to cliché do work here, because the acting and the writing make them work.The coming of age story, is really well told. As a drama it unfolds very well and there is always something that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a great story and a movie that you have to watch, if you like a good/well written drama. I thought this was going to be good, but I never expected it to be that good.",9,1,4,4 July 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," Living conditions
","Obviously the road name itself may remind you of a certain movie from the year 2008. A movie that was shot as 'found footage', unlike this one right here. Although the space is confined and this could've gone the same route too, which it doesn't. John Goodman plays host here and what a host he is ... Which is more of a question than a statement to be truthful, but I'll let it stay.There are actually a lot of questions in this one. One of them being if there actually are Aliens as proposed by Goodmans character or if he's just crazy. The road name adds to the mystery and there are a lot of strange things that may interpreted in one way or another. Actually because this is plays in a closed place, the tension is high and you don't really know if there is an escape or a look to the outside ... will there be? Do you want to watch this and does it sound intriguing? Then go ahead",8,0,0,22 January 2017
The Finest Hours," Raining Melodrama
","This is based on a true story (which I hadn't heard or read anything before watching the movie). Of course the movie will wring every last drop out of this. Or maybe this should not be a given, but you can expect it to be like this. If that puts you off (as I've seen happening with other reviewers), maybe you shouldn't watch this in the first place. That is for your own sake.If you decide to watch it, you should be aware of the journey you are taking. It is over the top, it is big emotions and it is bigger than life. It also has tension (even if you know where it is heading and even if you yell at the screen something that is logical but almost seems to happen by accident (almost at the end, some light will be shed on my cryptic sentence). Not the greatest movie ever made, but good and decent for what it is",7,1,2,11 November 2016
3:10 to Yuma," So what if its a remake?
","Of course I can't say anything about the original, because I haven't seen it yet. But I saw this movie/gem and was mesmerized by it. Surely one of the best westerns (if not the best) in the last decade! A shame it didn't win an Oscar (2 nominations though).From the leading men to the supporting cast, the performances are more than stellar. The story is told very raw and with an experienced director (Mangold) steering the wheel, everything moves along just in the right pace. Not too fast and not too slow. Although you can say it's more like the old school western, than a new style western (even the editing). If there's just a little love for western in you, than you have to watch this!",9,2,4,1 March 2008
The Sound of Music," You'll probably like it ...
",".. but me on the other hand, I didn't! And it's not because of bad film-making or anything like that. It just has to do with the fact, that the 'music' and 'singing' part, that I just didn't like at all! Yes I know, that's why it's called musical, but I saw the movie without any prior knowledge of what it's about or what genre it is, I just knew, that it's genuinely seen as a classic all over the world by many people.The story per se is also a good one, but with all the singing and dancing it felt too long. I do not want to affront anyone who's in love with this movie (we all have our own taste and that's a good thing), I'm just saying, that this movie was not getting to me ... at all! If you on the other hand, like drama (plus the musical part of it), all in a long movie, than you probably should watch this, if you haven't already! It remains after all a classic, despite my view of it :o)",5,8,23,9 July 2007
The Equalizer," King Kong ain't got ...
","You have to give it up for Denzel Washington. Liam Neeson has been the action hero of late (or so many will have you believe), but watching this, you know he isn't alone. I haven't seen John Wick yet, but apparently it's a fun ride too. There is drama in this too and it's still weird seeing Chloe Moritz in an adult role, but she's doing a good job with a small but important role.Denzels characters might channel a bit of Charles Bronson, but he's making it with his own unique charisma and flavor. One thing is for sure, if you have a Death Wish, just get on the bad side of him and you are on. The action is more than decent, the flow of the movie is good (with time to take a breath or to, before the action/violence starts up again). A good example of an action movie with a heart ... and a punch",9,2,5,3 April 2015
The Expendables 2," More and more ...
","I really envy those who enjoyed this more than me. I'm being serious, because most of the jokes didn't work for me. If you watch a movie like that (especially after the first movie introduced most characters to us), you know what you are up for. The first movie did have one particular scene (with Willis, Stallone and Schwarzenegger) that I thought was pretty funny. When some stars appear here and joke about their past (movies), some of the jokes just don't work for me. One of them has facts named after him and he recites one of those facts himself and it feels like torture (for me/the viewer).But the action is shot well enough. Jean Claude van Damme obviously has a lot of fun with his role and he is one of the few who hold up their end of the bargain (again that's how I felt). Terry Crews and the rest ... of the (normal) crew should've been featured more in the movie. One of the best scenes being the Expendables talking about food in one scene. Stallone and Statham also have some neat talk scenes between them. This may sound ridiculous to some, but I do like humor that works in my action movie. So again, I'd love to like this more, but it's hits and misses. So while I did enjoy it in parts, I was expecting better.",5,0,2,18 September 2012
War Dogs," Dogs of War
","Lord of War isn't that bad a comparison and throwing a bit of Wolf of Wall Street (with a tighter two men approach to it), you would say that comparison nails it. This is based on something that really happened and just the way it is portrayed is kind of mesmerizing. You wouldn't think some of those things would be possible. Would actually apply to the real world ... but apparently they do.Being the Devil's Advocate is one thing, getting greedy another. But you could almost argue it's human nature. And you wouldn't be too far off. Although obviously some do have a moral compass even when it doesn't always work, it may set off at some point and remind them of something they want and something they are or aren't. You may be shocked at how easy some things where back then, but that's life ... and it's really all about the ... Benjamins",8,0,2,14 June 2017
The Longest Yard," Not
","This is a comedy ... not. Well not for me at least. Yes I had one or two laughs, while I watched it, but all in all, I wasn't entertained. And the reason for that? Because it was a remake ... Again Not! I didn't care for it being a remake (Burt Reynolds didn't seem to mind either, so why should I?).It is just due to the fact, that the jokes are pretty flat. Adam Sandler can please the crowd and he has many fans, but even so, this movie doesn't even seem to appeal to all his fans. If you can laugh at 'Little Nicky' than you will probably like this one here too. But if you didn't, than stay away from this one, because you will regret it.",3,0,2,21 July 2009
Source Code," Groundhog Train
","While I am guessing you know the outline, I had successfully avoided any information relating to the movie. So I got in and watched it solely under the premise that it was Sci-Fi and Jake Gyllenhaal was in it. I didn't even know that it was the director who did 'Moon' (one of the surprise hits/movies of 2010).While this is more of an Blockbuster sort of movie, there are still themes running through it, that are very interesting. And if you are looking for them, there are quite a few questions that are being asked (some don't get a straight answer, so you have to make them up for yourself, if you want to). But, and that is the beauty of the movie, it works as popcorn movie. You can just enjoy the Thriller that unfolds :o)",8,0,1,8 January 2012
Skyfall," Finally ... Bond has come back to ... the cinema screens
","Don't get overexcited. Yes I know Daniel Craig has done a couple of other movies. But first of all, the waiting time between two Bond movies was a very long one this time around (around 5 years) and the waiting time for the real Bond was even longer. You could also write a summary line that goes: Will the real Bond please stand up? Apart from current or a bit older catch phrases from music or TV (wrestling), let's get back to what is essential. Just like the movie does. I understand that some people did not like what the movie did. But to celebrate the 50th birthday of Bond there could not have been a better movie (ok there always can be a better movie, but it's a pretty good one right here). I'm not going to reveal any plot points or other significant things that will be more than a treat for Bond lovers. There are so many gems in this one, but without forgetting to make it about a really good story.Daniel Craig must have finally arrived ... at least for most of the fans. Hopefully you can finally enjoy a Bond movie too, even if you didn't until now.",8,2,7,3 June 2013
50 First Dates," Pretty enjoyable
","While Adam Sandler is supposedly the star of this movie, the actual shining star is Drew Barrymore. The plot isn't really thick, but what she makes of her character in that confined environment is great. Another factor is of course the chemistry between Adam and Drew. And although it isn't the greatest on-screen pairing (not even close), it still creates enough believable buzz to work as a romantic comedy with a slight twist.That all being said, the jokes are hit and miss, like with many Adam Sandler movies. Even his regular comedy friends get their screen time and if you're a fan of his, than of course you will like the movie no matter what I or others will write. But as stated above, this is/was a pretty decent watch (even for me)",5,2,3,21 July 2009
The Hangover," Very Bad Things
","When a movie is funny, even though you have seen some of it's funniest moments in the trailer, you know you have a winner. Hangover, which does have some similarities to the movie 'Very Bad Things', but does not sport the same dark humor, is a comedy that works for many reasons and was therefor successful.The actors: Be it Bradley Cooper, who deservedly gets the main (active) role here, was a hoot when he was on Alias (JJ Abrams TV Show). Here he can display his comedic potential more than in 'He's not that into you'. Zach Galifianakis is a bit odd and might scare a few people off, but he is a perfect fit (no pun intended). Ken Jeong, whom I've seen in several comedies in the last few months and many other comedians (and a cameo here and there) really make a wonderful ensemble (if you can avoid it, don't watch the trailer, before you see the movie, one cameo in particular is just so much better, if you don't know what's gonna hit you ... again no pun intended).The story is pretty simple and you have to stretch your disbelief a bit, but it's all for the sake of really good comedy. And the ending is just perfect too. Everything fits and even though I don't know what they really would do in a sequel (there are rumors), I'd love to see one! :o)",9,0,0,21 September 2009
Iron Man 3," More like over the top!
","Or OTT as some like to say/write. And it definitely is. This is supposed to be a fun summer movie. That is a concept you have to get your head around. Another one is, that Shane Black is back. And I'm thankful for that. I was so excited after 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', but unfortunately it wasn't a commercial success. And though he has proved that he has talent (in writing and also in directing, see his biography), it seemed like Hollywood was done with him.Fortunately Robert Downey Jr. comes along and with the power he now has, can say: I want him as director. Not sure if it happened exactly like that, but whatever the circumstances, I'm glad he is able to do projects now with the Iron Man 3 success backing him up. As for Downey Jr. he seems to be bargaining for a new deal as Mr. Tony Stark. And he probably will get what he wants. Good for him.But what about the movie itself? The action is amazing (budget wise you couldn't expect anything less), but there is also a lot of wit in it. The script oozes with clever remarks and great quotes! Trademark Black! There is also clever hints and word plays (concerning the last events of the Avengers that is) and Tony Stark does have another evolution to go through. Great casting and especially great idea with Sir Ben Kingsley. Another 'Black-ish' element that is added to the mix. Though I have to admit, I'm not familiar with the characters of the comic itself, I know this movie did what it was supposed to do ... and then some! Let it entertain you!",9,30,52,21 August 2013
Child 44," From Russia with Crime
","Not sure how accurate some of the things are (this is based on a novel which is based on real events) we get to see in this movie. But you could believe that some of the things would have been possible to happen. It's no wonder that Russia was not really happy about the book of course (not the best depiction of authority or anything else going on there). Haven't looked up how the movie was received, but I can't imagine they welcomed it with open arms.Tom Hardy is as straight an arrow as you can get in this one, but he gets major support by Noomi and Gary to name but two. The incidents occurring that the movie is about apart from the human side of it, are despicable, not that anyone was actually confirming them. It's a tough watch especially because of its pacing, but it's solid and suspenseful from beginning to end",7,3,11,8 July 2015
The Ring," Not Japanese
","Funnily enough (or maybe not that funny for fans of the series or the original director Hideo Nakata), this installment is a better transformation from the original movies, than the sequel was! But beware a third part is scheduled for 2008! Judging after this movie that wouldn't be bad! So let's leave the sequel alone for a moment and concentrate on this. Naomi Watts takes the lead here and the movie does it's Japanese original justice, with it's adaptation. The story is changed for American/western audiences, but that's good and should be like that! And if you bought or rent the DVD, I have an easter egg that will have you ... Let's just say, this is not for the faint of heart!!!Follow these instructions (from dvdreview.com): 'Insert the DVD in your player and wait until the Main Menu comes up. Now press the 'Up' arrow key on your remote control and the cursor will disappear. If you press the 'Enter' key now on your remote control you will get to see the entire footage of the deadly videotape from the movie.'",7,0,0,18 May 2007
Deepwater Horizon," Disaster - for real
","Only hearing about this, is one thing. But seeing it unfold is a completely different thing. And it's amazing that they would not be afraid to lay out the blame. On the other hand it does seem a bit cliché to call out a big company like that. And you really do need a great actor to represent that company so it doesn't fall short on many aspects (and the movie did a good job at casting one).It starts off pretty easy and slow, but early on you can tell that something is about to happen. Foreshadowing like at the breakfast table is almost not necessary, but it does add an extra touch. When the mayhem begins though, there is no stopping and the effects are up for it. It's breathtaking and heartbreaking at the same time.",8,0,0,15 April 2017
Resident Evil: Afterlife," What's next?
","Just when you think it's all over, a new Resident Evil pops up. And this time it's 3-D too. It does continue the story where the 3rd left off, but it does leave a few question marks, that might not be revealed in this movie. Will Millas character finally set an end to it all though? You have to watch this to know for sure.The action is shot well and you even get a character from the Resident Evil 5 video game. A very big one that is, but wait til you see it (if you haven't been spoiled by the trailer that is). It is more the action than anything, that elevates this above the 5/10 mark for me. Of course you might feel it deserves more or less. It's not about the rating. It's about how entertained you are going to be. And therein lies the difference between quite a few people (or their feelings towards the Resident Evil series)",6,0,1,30 December 2010
United 93," Tragedy
","One of the most discussed things, when this movie was made, was the question, if this movie was made too early. How could someone try to capitalize on the grieve of others and so forth. But the families knew about this movie and as far as I know most of them wanted the story of their lost ones to be told. So why should we argue about this movie then? It's quite impossible that you don't know what happened on '9/11' at this point, but in a few years there will be teenagers and then adults who weren't born when that tragedy occurred or were too young to remember/realize what was happening. This movie will give them as near a picture of that as it is possible. The aim here is to keep it as real as possible! And that's why there is no political statement that is made here (neither for or against a view) nor are characters (= real people) glorified or being made fun of. It's almost a documentary. And that's why although this movie is good, it might be too hard for some people to watch/bare ...",7,1,1,26 April 2007
Deja Vu," No logic in here
","So don't even start looking for it. It's Tony Scott directing, for Pete's sake! How Denzel Washington can go back in time and change the past, although all what happens after that, despite him seeing the changes he made, does not happen as happened, so it wouldn't be possible that he changed anything, because that would mean, something must have changed, but it didn't! Confused yet? Don't be just let the movie entertain you! If you can't do that, that means you won't enjoy the movie! And it would be a shame, because it's light and funny. The action and the suspense are mixed good together (if you can stop thinking too much about the plot, that is)! Time travel has been handled better before (see 12 Monkeys), but that doesn't mean you have to write this movie off!",7,1,2,9 May 2007
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Kids Flick
","While some movies, with Aliens (clue is in the title) are not really suitable for kids, this one is made for them. And while a recent effort (DVD release) made some changes to make the movie even more kid 'friendlier', this still remains one of the best movies Steven Spielberg made.Most will be familiar with the movie, because it's a movie that is not only shown on TV, but a movie that is genuinely loved by many. A movie that parents like to watch with their kids. A fantasy (fairy?) tale for everyone then? I would say so, but of course, as with everything else, people have different tastes and therefor, there are also people who will despise this movie. Some might even hate the fact, that some themes could be (and have been) interpreted as Christian symbolisms. But if you free your head of that, you can enjoy a classic, as many others did too.",8,0,0,21 July 2009
It," IT ... is back
","Though I feel like I could use this/headline probably sometime in the near future. But leaving this aside, let's get to the meat of things (no pun intended). It's been a while since I saw the first attempt on bringing this to the screen. This or IT being another story by Stephen King. The first attempt was made for TV, so that and the fact it's been a while I wouldn't be surprised if the effects are nowhere near this newer version and that makes sense.Still I do remember Tim Curry doing a phenomenal job. Something Skarsgaard had to play against. I don't think you should compare myself, but I know that some may not be able to help themselves. Whatever the case, the new clown is terrifying as well. And the effects are really good. So while horror fans and hardcore horror movie watchers may not be as overwhelmed by this then the general audience, this still is a good film overall. And it still has a lot more 'blood' in it, than one may expect. Just not exactly the way you may expect it ... so don't expect a blood fest. Expect a genuinely scary movie, that will leave an impression with many young ones ... maybe you are one of them",8,2,4,1 November 2017
Hereditary," (re?)Born this way
","There was quite some buzz around this. As much buzz as last years 'It comes at night' had or this years 'Quiet Place' (which I have not seen yet). Now this buzz that build up, might be harmful to some. Especially if you are looking for a horror movie that has jump scare after jump scare. A movie that moves along fast and leaves you no room to breathe.Because this is not what this movie is about. It may not even be about what you first think it is about (or it mght as well be). The mystery around it, the slow moving pace, the dreadfulness surrounding it, make it (or as I stated above break it for some). Overall the quality of acting, cinematography, set design, directing is just amazing. If you care about all those things more than just entertainment (and I'm not bashing the latter or whatever preference you may have), than this movie will have you on the edge of your seat ... guessing away, how and where this will take you ...",9,1,6,23 November 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," The other Lincoln
","Having just also watched Spielbergs Lincoln, I do wonder which one is more historical accurate ... Seriously though: With a title like that, you know what to expect. An action packed not historical account of one Americas most influential presidents. And while you wouldn't expect it at the times we are living, he was Republican. A fact that doesn't really play a great role in this movie (based on a fictional novel), because it isn't political.Which makes the fact that after 2/3 of the movie, it almost turns serious kind of awkward. It feels strange when the action comes to a full stop (even though it's not for long). So while the action scenes are good, the drama is not up to the task. If you don't care for that, you might have more fun than I did, but I thought I'd warn you",5,0,0,4 February 2013
If I Stay," Novel to it
","I'm pretty sure the novel worked better than the movie itself. Which is by no way a fault of its main star. Nor the way the story evolves (cannot comment if the structure is the same as the book it is based on, as I haven't read that). It will also be touching and I'm sure you will be moved by how the story is portrayed.Still while we all can relate to many of the given themes here, the movie goes more on the romantic route than the dramatic one. Which is a shame because there are quite a few things that could've been played out better (imho). It's easy to keep up with the time frame, even if it might confuse a few people at first. What's important, is that you're always with the main character (no matter what your stance on religion, after Life and more things are, this is a story, nothing more nothing less). And Chloe takes another step (acting-wise) in the right direction",6,1,1,14 May 2015
John Wick," Wick MediNait
","Keanu Reeves is back. Well it's not like he was gone (though you could argue his character was in this one, before being forced to be 'back'), but this might be his best movie in years. Certainly one he is starring in. And I don't mean any disrespect against 47 Ronin (which could've been a lot better and I'm not talking about the poor CGI at places, but in general).Wick is kind of an Equalizer, but different. While Denzel is clearly the better actor, this evens everything up with a choreography that really gives you everything it got. Gunkata is a term you might have heard a couple of years ago. It's here again and it's no wonder that the two directors have a good relationship with Keanu (since working with him before a couple of times).Great 'guest' appearances and really good cinematography. This looks great and it has a lot of violence in it. If you're down with that, go ahead and watch and prepare yourself for the inevitable sequel/prequel or whatever comes our way",8,2,6,4 June 2015
Kung Fu Panda," Not Pixar, but great nevertheless
","Even Pixar will be happy that other companies can produce good animated entertaining movies. Kung Fu Panda owes of course much to it's voice talent. Jack Black has to be mentioned first, and even without having seen any extras or behind the scenes videos, I'm pretty sure he did some improvised/ad-libbing!But apart from that, the story works well too. It's full of in-jokes, one of which I only got after I watched the movie, when a friend of mine told me that 'shifu' means Master in Chinese ... Dustin Hoffmans character is called 'Master Shifu' ... see what they did there! Great entertainment for kids and adults then! :o)",8,0,0,12 September 2008
Rocketman," Elton Way
","First things first: this is close to a musical, with people starting to sing and dance (though Elton John is doing most of the singing of course). Now that is important because some people will cherish that fact and others will be annoyed to say the least.This is a different kind of musical biography ... you can't even begin to compare it to Bohemian Rhapsody. While there were some who didn't like the fact that the other movie went out of its way to interpret things and be free with the truth, this movie is pretty straightforward, that it does not play in the normal world, but yes a heightened feeling to it from the beginning. That doesn't mean, that certain things did not happen, it is just exaggerated. The main performance is great, though the Queen movie seems to have more powerful songs - of course Rocketman and other songs are great too and you may feel different about that sentiment anyway. Not an easy watch, especially considering the sexuality of Elton and some of the depictions - this also focuses on a certain time period. All that just fyi",7,1,1,20 July 2019
A Star Is Born," Stars - even before that
","Both leads can and should be considered stars, even before that movie. But the performances, both in the music and acting department are extraordinary. Unfortunately I already knew the ending - and still it was engaging as it can be. I wouldn't call myself a big Lady Gaga fan - but watching her here!? Wow, she is amazing and what a voice.Again it's not just her singing, but also her acting and it's here that Cooper comes to play to (no pun intended) ... and also direct. Having watched this now, I do understand the struggle some had to decide which movie was better: this or Bohemian Rhapsody ... I couldn't really pick one either. This is original, the other one has Queen.But why choose if you can watch both? And even if you prefer one over the other, they are both really good (even with the other movie apparently takes some liberties when it comes to facts and truth).

Gravity," (3D) Experience
","There is a reason the movie is called Gravity. There is a reason for a lot of things in this movie. And while you can 'blame' it for being too technical and being too thin on actual story (you can also say that there are clichés in this), it handles all that in a fashion that shouldn't matter to the viewer .. if the viewer can get excited about what the movie is really about.Survival is not easy and while it does exaggerate a few things a bit, it stays as real to facts as possible (for a fictional movie). But it never felt too fictional, putting you right into the 'action' and drama. Do things happen one after another and might seem rational implausible? Yes they do, but again the experience is too good, to be dismissing it like that.After the movie ended (and I have to stress out, the vote/rating is for the 3D version of the movie only), I was unable to get up ... Gravity you say?",10,1,5,2 June 2014
Lone Survivor," Tour de Force
","The movie is not easy to watch. Right at the beginning you'll some training 'videos' (more like footage) from the real people that are depicted in this movie. But it will be apparent a couple of moments later, that there is a lot of Death to follow. It's almost a case of what can go wrong will go wrong. And while there are a lot of other outcomes that this could've taken, decisions had been made, consequences had to be taken (upon).What really gets you though are not some clichés about soldiers (and I think this stays as much as possible away from them), but the fact, that this feels as real as it can be, without you actually being in a war. Mark Wahlberg and the other actors have to go through a lot, when ... well you know what hits the fence. And it does hit pretty hard. Not for anyone squeamish, this is fraught with tension ...",9,44,65,8 August 2014
Wind River," Cold as Ice
","Maybe even colder. But one thing is for sure: A slow story telling and one that does not care for a romance between its leads. Other movies might have tried to pair up the two character, but I think this works better this way. There is chemistry don't get me wrong and both play well off each other. But don't expect anything flashy or great happening ... well not the whole time.The pacing is key, so when something happens it appears bigger. Be it a chase or a possible stunt/action scene. This is about unraveling a story and finding the truth - but more about a certain seed that is planted that will get exploited later on in the movie. I won't say what, but it's fair to say that it will leave a mark. As does the movie - it does reward those with patience. Very fine acting and a nuanced story ...",9,1,2,2 April 2018
The Death of Stalin," Based on true events
","More or less I guess - but the movie never goes into details what truly happened, rather keeping the satire and fun up. The acting is superb and the humor is as dark and twisted as you can imagine. PC this isn't, quite the opposite. And you can understand why some Russians might not like certain depictions of historical figures and events.So if you like wicked entertainment and are not afraid to laugh even when it seems wrong to do so, remember this is just a movie, so it's ok here. It's not like you are rooting for someone evil in reality. Also Jason Isaacs almost steals the movie entirely. There is nuance and there is just flat out ridiculous. But all in great quality and entertainment.",9,3,5,14 July 2018
Se7en," Sinners are not Saints
","Those who try to punish Sinners are not Saints either of course. The movie who was showing people things that are going wrong with our society, is a showcase of Brad Pitt. Putting Morgan Freeman next to him was working more than fine. But it's the mystery surrounding the who is behind it all.The journey we take, with a conclusion that will leave you devastated (even those who knew or were able to see where it was going) to say the least. Fincher is showing he knows how to direct, edit and set the mood for a film. This is as assured as it gets and one of the best thrillers the 90s produced for the movie business. I won't go into the story, but if you like suspense, you will be more than happy to watch this (some scenes are tough to watch mind you!)",9,2,4,11 July 2015
I'm Not There," Well I was (there)
","Unfortunately for me as I might add. As I do not so much about Mr. Bob Dylan and wouldn't call myself a fan of his (neutral would be describing it best), I might have expected something else here. A sort of bio-pic, but not really. As many have stated, that does justice to the myth surrounding Mr. Dylan.While this might be true, I would've preferred a more straight approach to the whole thing. How can you mythologize a myth? It just doesn't work (for me). It would've been better to go the other direction. But having said that, I also do admire the guts from the director for trying something completely different. But even so, the bits and parts seem to have a different quality. While I was mesmerized by Cate Blanchett's performance (if it were only her the whole time, I might have given the movie an 8 or 9 as a vote!), there were other pieces that left me cold. And while threads and themes did appear, almost none of them got resolved. I know this was on purpose, but it still didn't help the overall experience. I expect that quite a few will disagree with me and my point of view, but I can only write how I felt/feel about the movie.",3,3,9,5 August 2008
Star Trek," That's what I call a 'Re-Imagining'
","The first Trailer I saw for this Star Trek movie, didn't look like a Star Trek movie at all. Actually when I saw the first frames of the Trailer (I didn't know it would be a Star Trek trailer, because I watched it in a cinema), I thought this was a trailer for the 'Fast & Furious' (2009) movie. A fast car, someone following that car, an insane stunt ... you'd be forgiven for thinking this was an car stunt movie ...And you might have had doubts about the end result of this movie. Especially if you were a fan of the Original Series and movies. This looked like some action movie, that had nothing to do with the charm that Kirk & Co were able to achieve on screen. And again you would be wrong. Of course William Shatner is a character in his own rights and he played 'James T. Kirk' as only he himself could play a role like that. But having said that, this new 'Tiberius' is great, too. In fact since this is Science Fiction, the explanation why we get a new 'Kirk' is a pretty good one (imho).Even my casting concerns, weren't an issue. The guy from Harold and Kumar in a Star Trek movie? Simon Pegg is great, but what is he doing in a Science Fiction movie? Well they all fit the bill. It's a fun ride and it can only get bumpy, if you really try to compare it too much with the Original Series. You shouldn't do that! This movie deserves to be seen ... and it doesn't even matter if you were a fan or just want to watch a good (fun) movie.",9,1,6,12 August 2009
Fury," Fury (Road to Berlin)
","Or wherever the road takes them of course. What a movie though? The 'intro' itself sets the tone. This is grim and not for the faint hearted at all. There is graphic violence and the war situation is depicted as not heroic. You could argue that we get a couple of clichés thrown in for good measure, but overall the acting and the story are able to bind you and keep you at the edge of your seat.The characters show off a couple of side, not all are or could be considered 'good'. But that's the 'reality' of war. Actually I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people despise Brad Pitts character ... only to sympathize with him a couple of moments later. To be able to make transitions like that speaks of the acting, but also the script at hand here. A really good anti-war movie, that is as gritty as they come",9,4,9,31 May 2015
Train to Busan," Even Korea isn't safe
","From zombies that is. Obviously if you're not into horror and/or zombies you probably shouldn't watch this. While it does also work as a drama (some of the best horror movies do), there is a lot of blood and a lot of violence. Just putting that out there (or should it be in there?). They also made an Anime as prequel to this. And while that is good in its own right (if you don't have an aversion against animated movies), you don't have to watch it beforehand.The acting is more than decent for a movie like this, but it is really a fast paced movie, so once it starts running, there is no real slowing down. Which is also true of the zombies. So if you're a 'purist', you may take issue with that. I personally like the slow zombies myself too. It becomes more of an action movie, when they run. Having said that, when it's done as good as it is here, I don't mind either.South Korea is good when it comes to action, so that was kind of to be expected. If you had the opportunity to watch this on the big screen, good for you. But with home cinemas evolved there is enough to take and enjoy at home too. Best watch it with friends though, to get a vibe going",8,4,8,17 April 2017
Darkest Hour," Light but heavy
","The central performance is really something. If you watch this you can see that Gary was a shoe-in for the Oscar. And that is not to put anyone else or rather their performances down. This is about a fantastic performance from a guy who always delivers and whose time it was to win the Golden Boy (aka Oscar).But Academy Awards aside and maybe some of the jokes too, this is very talk heavy. And I could hear some people sigh the longer it went on. So while I didn't feel this was or rather is too long, I can understand if some people may not have the patience to really watch something like this for so long. If you are aware of that and critisize the movie for this, you are doing the movie a disservice and other potential viewers might not feel that way.So while you can argue about the place in film history in general, you can't argue about the performances in this. The speeches could have gone wrong or backfired, but they didn't ... they actually made this really good. It's almost a shame quite a lot of it, is shown in the trailer",9,1,4,12 April 2018
The Maze Runner," Escape (without a) Plan
","This is a pretty decent effort into the teenager foray, breaking into the Hunger Games area/mold. It avoids the trappings of love triangle, going for mystery and special effects instead, doing a nice job most of the time. Obviously in the inevitable sequel(s) this will change, plus the ending might feel like ... the movie was stretched to put it mildly.Hopefully though you won't care and buy into the whole suspense and what's going on, who are we kind of vibe the movie is sending out. The questions that you won't get an answer to in this movie and many things that feel like they are wrong if you think about them, should only start if you are not affected by that vibe. It's a bit male dominated, but still a nice watch",7,0,4,12 April 2015
Memento," Have I seen you before?
","If you have watched the very first movie done by Mr. Nolan, than yes you have seen this before. Not exactly like this and with quite a few flaws, but if you consider that it was more or less a student film and seeing this, probably nothing more than an exercise on how to do it on a grand scale, than it was more than decent.Nolan is one my new favorite directors and as the rating does show you here, I am not alone. Not that that will convince you he is better than you think he is. Actually you might even not like Memento, for one reason or another. There is people out there who just want to be entertained, when they go watch a movie. And that's not a bad thing. Nor does that mean that if someone likes, say Transformers 2 better than this movie, that he/she has no clue. It's just a matter of taste.I for one, can tell you that this is a movie that merits watching it more than once. And the disc version offers you to watch the movie ... in a different 'order', which gives you a new unique experience. If you haven't watched it yet, you are in for treat. And don't worry, if you don't understand everything the first time you watch it ...",10,1,4,16 September 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Waltz with Pitt
","C. Waltz is the new discovery in this movie. He might have had a following in German speaking countries, but with this movie, he's getting world famous. Speaking 4 languages (and that's only in this movie, who knows how many more he is able to master) and being the main actor in this, despite the title of the movie. Which leads us to one thing that might be appalling to some people (especially to those who love(d) the original 'Inglorious Bastards').The thing is that the 'Basterds' (and yes the spelling mistake was intentional by Mr. Tarantino) do not get that much screen time. It's almost as if their story isn't the main act. You could have a problem with that (not only as a fan as stated above), so be aware that this is more an ensemble picture. And as said, Mr. Waltz is fantastic (I'm pretty sure we're gonna see more of him soon). Brad Pitt would be the second one to mention. Eli Roth on the other hand, as fun as it is to see him on the big screen, he just doesn't fit the bill. Til Schweiger and the other German and European actors are all really good. I'd say that some give the performance of their life.Speaking of the actors, one of the things that I really loved, is the fact that the movie is at least tri-lingual (is that a word?), french/German/English (with a bit of Italian thrown in there for good measure). That means a lot of subtitles if you watch the original version. But it works (imo) and makes the movie that much better.Another thing that you shouldn't expect though, is too much action. I heard quite a few people that criticized the movie, for being too talky. But that's Tarantino for you. There is action of course, but the long running time (might be a bummer for some) is made up by many conversations. There is tension, there is fun to be had, but the movie does take it's time to reach it's goal. Again, something that won't work for everybody. Great movie that cements Tarantinos status as great director.",9,2,8,27 September 2009
Underworld," Sexy back
","Kate Beckinsale brought sexy back with this movie. Back from the undead that is. I'm assuming you know what the movie is about, though I'm not gonna spoil anything about the end of the movie, I put the spoiler tag up for those who want to be surprised. I doubt that you haven't heard about the movie. This is the one that made vampires vs. werewolves legitimate again! Plus it also brought those weird leather costumes back. I'm sure some people got their fetish from this. But it's not the costume that made the movie for me. It's Kate and Billy N., who both are great in their respective roles. You also get Scott Speedman as love interest, so both sides are equally covered here. The action is great too and the movie obviously was successful enough to spawn another 3 installments. Only two of them had Kate in them though",7,1,2,3 May 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Star Wars 3,5
","So before we continue with Star Wars 8 (or VIII to be more exact), we get this solo movie. And after Episode 8 we'll get the next (Han) solo project to fill the time until Episode 9. This one concentrates on the story before New Hope, which was made fun of on the internet as many can imagine. People were talking about leaked pics of the sequel to Rogue One, posting pictures of Episode 4 (A new Hope).If you are not too invested in the time-line or the franchise, you may not see all the small details and hints to the other movies, but you will still able to enjoy a Science Fiction movie that is suspenseful enough and which does what it set out to do (no pun intended). A nice assemble of actors and a pretty neat story ... effects are great as always",7,1,4,24 June 2017
Captain Marvel," Shazam
","Alright so I'm guessing since DC brought out their movie (Shazam), many have become aware of a little fact concerning that super hero (over at the other side): Shazam once was called Captain Marvel. That was way before Marvel existed - and then Shazam (fka Captain Marvel) was not used anymore, Marvel Comics came into the mix and they just got that name for one their heroes. You can read more about this online obviously and have fun watching Shazam trying to come up with a name for ... well Shazam, in the movie DC made.All that aside, this might have felt like a full stop for some who were just waiting for Endgame. And it is understandable. Ant Man, well we knew him and so that wasn't that bad having him 6 months before Endgame came out, but Captain Marvel? Now don't get me wrong, I more than enjoyed the movie, even if certain aspects of it were clear and not that surprising (enemies of Ms. Marvel) in the twist department. But Brie Larson has so much obvious fun, it really is contagious.There was a bit of hiccup before the movie was released about some statements Brie made, but I never really got into that and whatever she said (or didn't) should not play a role in your enjoyment. I mean Samuel L. Jackson is back as the only one we know in this universe, when it comes to the MCU - and he is younger! CGI at full effect! And it really works wonders. An Origin story before the 'conclusion'? Yes (Captain) Marvel even pulled that off ...",8,4,11,8 June 2019
Coraline," Predictable, but fun nevertheless
","The story isn't really a big mystery and you will have figured out, where it all heads after a few minutes. But the journey is it's own reward in this case. The visuals are really great (and I only watched the 2-D version) and the voice cast they assembled, fits perfectly into the story.It is like a fairy tale, so the lack of story surprises shouldn't be bothering you, but you should bathe in the visual surprises the movie has in store for you. Much love and surely a lot of work has gone into the animation of this movie and it translates onto the screen. If there still is a bi of little kid in you, let it out and enjoy the movie without being to critical about the morality or simplicity of the story.",8,1,3,16 August 2009
This Is the End," Flavor(-ing)
","The movie is either really tough to sell or you will be overjoyed watching it. I can't (as many who have watched it) the least bit of neutral rating and writing about it. I thought it was funny as hell (pun intended)! But this won't be seen as such by some, because humor is really very specific to people. Things that I thought were hilarious, other people will find boring.The ending, without giving it away of course, will only appeal to certain audiences too. And it's all because of a joke that hit close to home with the actors (and filmmakers I suppose). I was delighted by it, but there has to be some knowledge to get it and even think of it as funny joke. Generally speaking most jokes and the movie itself was made as a labor of love and I'm sure was what Rogen and the others thought of as funny. This isn't Being John Malkovich! This is the lowest common denominator! Are you ready to entertained on that level? Than try it out! If you want something substantial, you might want to look at other movies though",9,2,9,3 October 2013
Dawn of the Dead," Fast & Furious
","If you can get your head around the fact, that this is called 'Dawn of the Dead' but is more an action movie, rather than a horror movie. Hence do not compare this with the original (Romero) Dawn! It works pretty good as an action movie. Zombies that can run, may or may not be your thing (I'm still with the slow ones). Social criticism has gone (almost completely) AWOL, but it is still nice to see at least one familiar face (Ken Foree that is).I really dug this movie although I am really big fan of the Original. But as I have said before, you can't compare the movies. And even though I haven't seen the Day of the Dead remake (haven't heard nothing good about it at all), I'm pretty sure this is one of the better remakes of Romero movie (even or because it does not try to imitate it).",7,0,1,26 November 2011
Iron Man 2," Sequel does not always mean more
","In this case, you might be forgiven to think, that there are too few action scenes and too many exposition and/or story scenes. But if you like that sort of thing (they are still tying a few things together for another movie and I'm not talking about the inevitable third installment in the series), you will have quite a few things to enjoy here, as did I and a quite a few others.It risks quite a bit for trying to stay true to the first part and have quite a few character beats, instead of many action scenes, that might have won more fan boys and would probably have grossed more at the cinemas. But as it is, it did play well and it's a very good film. I am a big fan of Robert Downey and he really is smooth and does know what do with this role. He owns it. A talk-y superhero movie, that works on almost all the levels.",8,0,2,7 October 2010
Alien: Resurrection," The other Alien
","This was quite the ride. Sigourney Weaver had a lot of cloud by this point (deservedly so), but also a weird choice for director (probably) and allegedly studio interference again. The latter is not as obvious as with the third installment. But many people trying to get things they want in an Alien movie ... well the end result couldn't really be another masterpiece.And wo while the previous movie started a sort of decline, this continues the same path - so not really good. After the how the third movie ended you may wonder how Ripley will return for this one ... well the mystery is solved quite quickly at the beginning. Though there is some other revelation saved for later. Still the whole premise is 'bananas' to say the least. But whatever - and especially if it means we get an Alien 5 sometime in the future after those 'story additions' from Ridley Scott the last couple of years.Great cast, Weaver having a blast (even if her character is quite inconsistent) - there is enough for any self proclaimed (or otherwise) Alien fan to enjoy here. Or any Science Fiction fan for that matter. This can be fun and it has enough suspense and winks to the other overall Alien world/fan base ... not to mention quite the interesting take on humor and other things. The director again",6,0,0,19 May 2020
World War Z," Book (it)
","I haven't read the book, so I can't say how it compares to that (book obviously must have more fleshed out characters and such). I can only say that I was surprised that I liked the movie. And from what I heard it was the most successful movie Brad Pitt has done so far (Box Office wise that is).So while it was only PG-13 in the cinemas (there will be an extended cut available on Disc soon), it still had a few punches to deliver. Mostly emotional but also action wise. While the director wouldn't have been associated with Horror prior to this, he did a really good job conveying the terror and the tension that builds up in a situation that is depicted in the movie. It is pretty straight forward and therefor somewhat predictable I guess. But I thought they would be aiming at another ending.And if you have heard about the history of the movie you know that they actually re-shot 30 minutes. The last 30 minutes of the movie. Maybe it is apparent to some, maybe not. Shouldn't be a distraction or something that will disable your ability to enjoy the movie though",8,6,15,30 August 2013
Passengers," Long way to go
","I heard the critics too. And I get that this is not for everyone. But I do believe that a rating that is currently around 7 (out of 10) is pretty accurate for this movie. It is good, it's not amazing or breath taking (excuse the pun), but it really is suspenseful and it does keep it real (if you buy into the whole notion that this space mission/travel thing is or will be possible in the first place of course).We do have some great actors involved in this, but you can imagine that there are moments in the movie where some may feel the movie could offer more. But that would not be keeping it real. Of course there are some decisions that are questionable at best, but that's life and that's how people work sometime ... Really good character piece surrounded by Science Fiction, but only watch it if you like human drama mixed with it!",8,3,4,13 May 2017
The Hunger Games," Battle Royale for the young ones
","I am referring to the audience watching. Because the original Battle Royale (japanese movie) with a similar theme, was more of an adult version of this movie right here. Having said that, the idea is so good it translates to the screen, even if it is watered down a bit. Plus I was just enjoying the girls moaning and exhaling in general while watching this and finding romance even in the weirdest of situations. Throw in Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and the always reliable Stanley Tucci for some acting/weirdness weight and you got yourself a movie.Apparently though the movie has not covered everything the novel had to offer (which should be no surprise). What should be a surprise to anyone who was living outside the US, is the fact, that this was one of the most anticipated movies in recent history (though I'm more than happy that The Avengers beat them at the total box office of course). Better drama, story and acting than Twilight, hopefully it stays that way and won't dwindle down the road ...",7,33,45,31 May 2012
Zootopia," Welcome to the Jungle
","Actually welcome to the City (Zoo). Suspend your disbelief you say? Well obviously that is something you should do! It's a cartoon for one and there is an animal society, not unlike many humans have build around the globe. And there are many allegories that may be able to make you think about stuff you do or preoccupied ideas or notions you have about other people.All in all, this does deal with clichés in a funny way, but also has a story that is intriguing. The idea that some can become wild and therefor be a menace to society is not new. But setting it not only in an animated feature but one that is also aimed at kids could be considered risky. But Disney pulls it off. So good in fact that I would not be surprised if the Oscar goes to ... but we'll see about that. Watch it and make up your own mind of course",9,3,6,22 January 2017
12 Monkeys," Watch it again ... and again ... and again
","Terry Gilliam is one of the finest filmmakers of our time. And this movie just underlines this. With Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and other fine actors (you can read their names on the cast list here) he is on the right track.A movie concerning time travel could only mean that there would be flaws in the story. It's just impossible to make one and not have flaws. That was what I thought, until I watched this movie. A flawless depiction of time traveling. Because it shows that you can not alter the past. If you could alter the past, than it could not have happened which would mean, it never existed as a form of a past (unless you work with multiple dimensions, than it could work, without being completely questionable).So yes Bruce Willis is send back in time to change what had happened ... but he doesn't, because he can't ... no he is send there because he is part of the past. And although he doesn't know it, he kind of is trapped in a loop. Or at least it does seem like one, actually it isn't. He has a beginning and an end, but since he goes back in time, when he is actually in the past, his future (for example his birth) is still in the making ... although he dies before that ... sounds confusing? But it is not really ... and that is what is fantastic about this movie ... you always have the answer right in front of you, but you only get it at the end (when it's to late)",10,0,2,6 April 2007
The Impossible," Disaster
","This is based on a true event, but all from the perspective of one family. You may call this predictable and you won't be wrong about it, but it's not so much where it goes (or where the character go), but the journey itself. The visual effects are amazing, making it look and feel as if you were actually there. And all this is achieved without 3D (well at the time of writing, I haven't seen any production company making a 3D conversion on the movie).The acting is really good, but you could and should expect this. It's the bigger picture that counts anyway. The drama is heightened as much as the waves (or even more) and the conclusion will either leave you agitated or pleased. But it will not leave you without a feeling, that's for sure ...",8,1,2,5 August 2014
42," Another sports movie?
","Obviously there is more here, breaking down a racial past too. Harrison Ford in an unusual role, but still more than charismatic. And while it does a very good job in general, it might not be everyones cup of tea. The movie is acted out very well, but some people might not have the patience to sit through another sports movie. Another thing you have to think about: Baseball is big in the US, but not so much in Europe or other parts of the World.Having said that, the story is more than worthy looking for, because it does concentrate on things happening outside the 'field', which is sometimes devastating and sometimes life ensuring (depending on what is happening). There is no doubt where this is heading, but the road to it's final goal is not an easy one ... The movie is packed, but still easy to follow though",7,0,2,19 May 2014
Shaun of the Dead," Pulling no punches (or LPs for that matter)
","This is seriously funny. Offensive in every way, but funny nevertheless. A camera tracking shot that gets repeated is just a showcase of both humour and expertise. But it doesn't stop there. Meant as homage to George Romero (the title of course referring to Romero's Dawn of the Dead and therefor the undead being nothing like the ones from the Dawn Remake), this little movie is pure genius.One of the references, involves a phone conversation with 'Barbara', which made me laugh out loud in the cinema. And I was the only one laughing. I almost felt bad about it, but then again, even Romero himself didn't get the in-joke (if you're a filmmaker you'll understand, that certain things are more precious to fans of the movies, then they are to you).But it's not only that. It's the fact, that this movie goes all the way (no pun intended). I was surprised how brutal it was (I didn't know the rating back then, it was shown in a sneak Preview). If you can stomach it, this will be one movie you'll really enjoy (even without getting any references)!",9,1,4,2 February 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," The critics hated this ... so what?
","This movie wasn't made to satisfy the critics. It was made for the fans of the first Pirates movie (and of course for the Captain Jack Sparrow aficionado in most of us!). But still why do some people despise this movie? It's simple they point out, that it's not enough story to justify the running time. Although this is right to a great extent, it's not what you should be looking for in this movie. This movie was made to entertain, nothing more and nothing less. And although other movies do try that too (some fail others succeed), this one has Johnny Depp. It's as simple as that. Of course other actors are good here too, but the main attraction is Cpt. Jack.If you have seen the first one, you will eventually see this one too, so don't resist the urge to see it and don't listen to some of those critics, telling you it's a waste of time! It's up to you to decide, if you like it or not! (a last little note: The fabulous line from the trailer said by Will Turner: 'Never mind, let's go!', has gone awol ... A shame, because it was great joke, but they kind of explain that on the audio commentary on the DVD)",8,0,2,5 May 2007
Argo," Heightened reality
","While the movie is based on real events, this doesn't mean everything happened exactly like it is portrayed in the movie. Actually quite the opposite is the case. And I don't think it would be fair to say it is unfair to all Iran. Especially because we are talking about a movie and because it does only portray the (then acting) government as evil. And as mentioned, there are quite a few things that are heightened for 'entertainment purposes' and most of them work nicely.There are quite a few Iranians who actually help or try not to be pressed into doing evil things. The actual way of how Ben Afflecks character thinks he can help the people seems far fetched, but it is something that happened (again not as heightened as it is shown in the movie). The fact, that you actually know where this is heading from the start, does not change the fact, that you might be able to enjoy watching it (unless you want to read something into this movie that is).",9,5,8,5 July 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Captain Jack Sparrow arrives
","And he has a great entrance. A really great one, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it! Even if it's only the first scene with Johnny Depp as Cpt. Jack Sparrow! While many/some have dismissed Johnnys performance here as being gay, I do think his intentions were others! That's not only because he himself said so in an interview (his inspiration being Keith Richards as he said), but also because I saw him as crazy, but genius guy, who was different.But kudos have also to go out to Gore Verbinsky. First of all, for resurrecting the pirate movie 'genre' (maybe genre is not the right word, but you get what I mean) and also for sticking to Johnnys decision to play Sparrow the way he did! It's know that the studio didn't want Johnny to play it like that. They were afraid, that Johnny's performance would destroy it at the box office ... quite the opposite happened! Captain Jack Sparrow is the one who saved this thing from drowning (excuse the pun)! If you haven't watched it yet, go out and see it now! A great adventure with a crazy/great guy in the middle of it!",10,0,3,30 July 2007
Star Trek Into Darkness," Sci Fi light
","To please the mass fan base is very difficult. And Star Trek and/or any of the spin offs that came from it, has a huge fan base. While I was more aware of the Next Generation TV show than the other shows that exist, I still appreciate what they're doing in recreating something known. I liked the first one (even despite the criticism it got) and thought it was really good.This one continues in the same vain, with great action and superb effects. Quinto and Pine really dug into their roles and the relationship they're having is what makes this movie really good. Having Alice Eve as a new face in it (her character will have people trying to guess what she's up to) also helps. Funnily enough her beautiful body seems to have distressed a few people who thought it was too 'erotic' for a Star Trek movie. Before I even watched the movie I asked around (in Germany) and no one could pin point a scene that they thought was too risky! After watching it, I still think: 'Too much ado about nothing'.So let that not hinder your viewing experience! Enjoy a really good Science Fiction movie",8,2,5,29 August 2013
12 Angry Men," Classic in every sense and moment and frame
","I could go on, but I thought I'd stop there before my summary line gets too big. Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.But back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn't yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.Now that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you're inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened. Even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so.There are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and I'm sure there quite a few sources online to look for. Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. But again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so. It does not mean you are wrong and it surely does not mean that this movie is falsely considered a masterpiece!",10,0,0,21 October 2019
Hostel," Two movies in one
","The movie does change half way through. But that's not a bad thing. Not for me at least. There are other movies who did that, too (think Mr. Rodriguez & Mr. Tarantino, the latter is also a producer of this movie, coincidence? ;o) ).The first half of the movie shows us, three men (two Americans) who are on a 'Eurotrip', searching for ... girls/woman. What is shown here, must have been a shock for the American rating board! But after all this fun, the violence starts to kick in. Now it might not have been that explicit, but that wasn't the point. Although I'm pretty sure, that for some people it wasn't violent enough and for others it was too violent. But you can't please everyone.And it's not only about what is shown (and there is quite a bit of gore to see here), but you caring about the characters. I've heard that people said that the main characters where not sympathetic, but I beg to differ. You've got a cool gut, shy guy and a 'crazy' guy in the group, so Eli Roth (director) has good variety of guys thrown in the mix. And I did care for them. In fact it might be that I cared too much.One thing is for sure: I'll never see East European Girls like I saw them before. ;o) Seriously though: If you don't have a problem with (female) nudity and violence, than this can be a pretty cool fun ride! Hostel delivers the goods (in every sense).",9,1,2,22 April 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Fantasy
","Harry's fault once again, I guess. It seems the shadow of the Potter movies are as big for this one as it can get. While a fun movie, that you can watch with the whole family (spoofs aside), it seems pretty ridiculous too, if you think about it. But then again it is for the younger ones, isn't it? It is a kiddie tale after all, so try and watch it with youthful eyes (or a kid by your side). It will be a different experience. Especially if it's not watched cynically. That can be fun too of course, but you can do that the second time around, can't you? Seriously though: decent enough acting, a story that is not that hard to follow and some fantasy thrown into it for good measure. If that's your cup of tea, enjoy :o)",6,0,0,7 September 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Not without flaws, but ...
","There is a moment (or two), where the movie is close to lose its way or get off its track. But it's only a momentary thing that will go away almost instantly. It manages to go through the clichés without hurting itself. And while women might only be interested in Ryan Gosling (and who can blame them?), there is more to the movie than that. It is rare that a romantic comedy can be as good as this.And while other movies try to up the ante on raunchiness, this one almost goes the opposite direction and does a great job in doing so. With Carell, Gosling, Stone, Moore and Tomei you have excellent actors who can convey almost anything, if the material is right. And right it is! Even if the end feels a bit like a cheat, it gets away with it. You won't really mind ...",9,4,7,5 March 2012
Green Room," Will there be a three color trilogy?
","After Blue Ruin, we get the Green Room. So something with Red should be coming up next. And while the two movies do not have much in common (apart from the same director and the main actor of the first one being in this one too), they are both mean and gritty. They both will test you in a way, while watching it.There is so much happening and there are some really good twists that you may not have seen coming. But this Rock and Roll kind of attitude will either entice you or annoy you I guess. And while the violence is there, it's not like this has spectacular action choreography. And still just the mood it creates, the suspense it holds out throughout and everything from set design to sound design is just creating a movie that is able to get to you - if you let it.",9,4,8,14 December 2016
The Notebook," Romance never dies
","If it is depicted as it is in this movie, anyway. A movie, that makes you fall in love with Rachel McAdams (or maybe her male counterpart, depending on your orientation), a movie that actually convinces in it's romantic roots, which sadly can't be said about many movies. Then again, this is based on a novel, which I unfortunately haven't read yet and which could mean the difference.The complex storyline has us staying with two characters (James Garner and Gena Rowlands are genuinely fantastic and the center piece/gravitas of the movie), while we listen to a story that is being told. While that means, we have a few characters that we have to follow and different stories that we have to stay on focus with, we never lose touch with any of them. Which is a great achievement of the book (I guess), but also of the director and the cast. Although it just has it's 5th anniversary, I consider it a classic (and I don't use that term often)",10,1,3,21 July 2009
Public Enemies," Heat it ain't
","Everyone tells you not to compare it with Heat, but it's almost inevitable. Of course Heat is the superior movie and Public Enemies can only lose if compared to it. Apart from the fact, that we have the same director here, we have some similar situations.Two actors that are considered to be top players in their generation (De Niro & Pacino with Heat and Depp plus Bale here). While Depp (almost) lives up to that comparison, Bale fails to deliver. It might also be the fact, that his role is much smaller than the Pacino counterpart, but he's still less effective. There is one big scene where both of them collide (in the prison), which could be seen as a counterpart to the coffee scene from Heat. A great scene here and there, but while Heat explored Pacino and his motivations more, we get nothing from Bale. What drives him, his passions, his faults/flaws. And Heat had Val Kilmer. Public Enemies has a few great actors, but no one equals the Impact Kilmer had on Heat (even Dorff, in one of his better roles in recent years, can't reach that).While all this might give you the feeling that the movie isn't really good ... it actually is. It's a pretty good movie indeed. It just can't reach 'Heat' ... but then again, which movie can? And while I myself wasn't as aware of the real-life person Johnny Depp is portraying, I'm pretty sure Americans know him better and therefor the movie itself works better for them. Mann doesn't have to fill every little aspect of Dillinger, if people already know what happened (more or less). So it wouldn't be a bad thing, re-watching the movie, with the knowledge what went down in 'reality'. :o)",8,0,0,16 September 2009
The Babadook," Low key horror
","Are you tired of horror movies just relying on jump scares? And I mean relying on them entirely without building a story or something other to create tension and suspense of course. Because we do have jump scares in this one too. But it builds on character and story and therefor is (imho) more effective.Having said that, it tries to create a new 'legend'. It is build around a short movie (which I haven't seen, so I can't comment on that), but the movie surely does work on its own too. The acting is good and the directing is good too. Another female director to step up to the plate and deliver, which may be the reason it doesn't rely only on effects. Whatever the case, it works ...",8,5,16,31 December 2014
Madagascar," Voice Magic
","This animated movie has two big things going for it and the first is it's the voice cast they have on display here. From David Schwimmer (of Friends fame) all the way to Jada Pinkett Smith. The story it's telling is not so original. The characters are drawn to another world, so far nothing new.But aside from the stellar (voice) performances there, the second thing this movie has going for it and almost let's you forget about the plot inconsistency or any other problems with the story, are the penguins! They even made a special short movie for the DVD! The penguins are just great! Not a Pixar classic, but still a fun movie to watch then! :o)",7,1,2,7 July 2007
The Other Boleyn Girl," Period
","Every other (and mostly good) periodic drama, tries and puts contemporary issues in it's theme (or at least the story). This isn't any different, showing us gender issues (and family/royalty problems as well). And putting Scarlett J. and Natalie P. in the movie, one can understand Eric B. (or his characters) dilemma ... But let's not get into the story, the question is, is this movie, worth your time? I think it is.Not only for those who like there costume/period drama (they'll watch the movie, regardless of what I or anybody else is gonna write), but also for newbies and people who like dramas. This movie is very well acted, could be a bit tighter on the pacing part, but all in all, it was a satisfying experience/movie.",7,0,1,2 August 2008
Us," eltbUS - or SUbtle
","This is not flashy or shiny and it may not really cover your need for grandness. Just because this is slow burning, does not make it bad, but it may make it an experience some viewers will not like. It's about taste, what you like in a movie and what you expect from it. If you take the acting, the way this is assembled, the symbolic meanings, the soundtrack, the dialog, the structure ... it is almost flawless. And I say almost because there is always something you can detect that you may feel (or is) flawed.You may know or kind of get where this is going, but it doesn't take away the fun one can have with it. As I mentioned above this has all the right ingredients and has some 'wow' moments too. It does not shy away from depicting or showing the violence and it has social messages. Whether you see them or not is another thing - or even care for them. Wicked idea and really good interpretation of it",9,0,8,19 June 2019
The Danish Girl," Girls
","This movie is here to make some people feel uncomfortable. And just the fact that you have a person that feels he is more than a 'he' and more like a 'she' alone will be appalling to some. If that does not turn into hate, everything is OK. Because while we may not agree on other peoples decision or even feelings, we should be accepting them for what they are or want to be.And this movie does a good job giving us a behind the costumes look on a transformation. While it is only loosely based on two people and I am not an expert on them, I cannot comment on how much creative freedom was taken on certain things. But this is a movie and it does have that vibe and feeling to it. Not to mention a really nice flow to the story. There will be nudity, but you probably are aware of that already.",8,0,2,17 September 2016
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Bigger than Super Bowl (?)
","Not my words, but what Rachel McAdams said on her press tour about Eurovision itself. She would never be so self centered to claim that about the movie or herself. Although since I'm not her, to me she is bigger than super bowl (and Eurovision for that matter).Now my love for her aside (what Ryan Gosling is for those who are into men from the Notebook, Rachel is for those into women ... well most of them anyway I would reckon), the movie is quite funny, while also being able to go dark. An explosion that is quite horrible (with body parts flying around), is being made fun of. This obviously is not for the faint hearted or easily offended or squeamish. If that is not something that is applicable to you and your humor alligns with that of the movie - there is quite some fun you can have. With a mesmerizing Rachel McAdams - in case I hadn't made that point clear already. Will Ferrell is nice too, but she (and even Dan Stevens as 'Russian') steal the show - no pun intended!",8,1,1,5 July 2020
Ice Age: The Meltdown," An enjoyable follow-up
","It's not entirely necessary for you, to have seen Part 1 to watch this sequel. But it doesn't hurt either. The producers took notice of what worked in the first movie and tried to capitalize on those things here ... One of the things being Scrat! One word that's enough to describe the success of the Ice Age movies. You have to see him/it to believe it! :o) But they also knew, that they had to bring new characters in the mix here or else they would have bored (= repeat the first part) some/many people! So you have extra additions to the already existing excellent voice cast. The script is funny enough and this animated feature is both for kids and grown-ups to enjoy! :o)",7,0,0,25 April 2007
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Entertaining (game) adaptation
","I have played the original 'Prince of Persia' on an old PC, back in the day. Of course you cannot compare this movie to that game (or any other game) that came out up to the point they made the movie. And this might be one of the best adaption of a game yet. It is entertaining, light and has adventure. What more could you want? Jack G. is also very convincing in his (key) role, which I have to admit, wasn't so sure about. And I wasn't the only one who raised an eyebrow, when I heard he was going to be the lead in this. Gemma Arterton seems to be everywhere right now. The Girl from St. Trinian was also in the Clash of the Titans remake and quite a few other movies coming out. And she deserves all the attention she is getting.Overall this of course is popcorn, but is made in a fashion so that you can enjoy it. Unless you were expecting something different or have a problem with Bruckheimer movies in general (it's hit and miss with me, in this case, obviously hit, no pun intended).",8,0,2,8 October 2010
Ted," TED bringing all the Family (guy fans) together?
","Of course this is not aimed at kids, I just thought that summary line was funny. This movie actually does one thing right some other movies fail to do: It stays consistent from start to finish and that on a really good level of entertainment. Kudos to the director (also the voice of Ted in the movie) for mastering this.Now as you can tell by the trailer this is a really insane comedy. Outrageous and crazy would be two other adjectives you could describe it with. Foul language and crude humor should be your thing, if you want to watch this and enjoy it. If you haven't seen the trailer and you don't want too many story spoilers, just search for 'Thunder song Ted' and watch that little snippet from the movie. If that makes you laugh, you will love the movie! One other thing I took from watching this: 'So this is where we draw the line'. Something everyone can use to good effect ... ;o)",9,0,4,14 September 2012
Knives Out," Expectations and ... well
","When you are really really anxious to watch a movie, because you believe it is good, it can turn out to become quite sour. Especially when that movie does not even come close to what you wanted it to be. Now if you are a fan of crime movies and 'whodunnit' stories, this will not just tickle your interest, this will give you joy.Now I know that others may work otherwise with expectations and how they deal with twists and other things. You can see a few things coming, some may even argue they know everything (something I personally can't imagine, because the guessing game is strong in this one - and yes don't compare this to the directors Star Wars entry) ... but the way this is edited, the way the story unfolds and not even to mention how great the acting is ... this is rated high and very deservedly so! Try to read as little as possible about the movie and the story and just go with the flow ... you will (most likely) not be dissapointed",10,0,3,31 March 2020
Oldboy," Grown up
","I haven't read the Manga (comic) this is based on, but I can tell you that the movie is very devastating. It also features things that might not be as apparent as they are, especially to western audience members. There is a different sense of honor and sensibility in general, something that is difficult to translate (more on that on my review for the US remake).The lead role is played by great gusto, but the villain of the piece is great too. You can argue about motives all you want and about character decisions (see sensibility and how this movie ends), but it all works out nice. There are quite a few remarkable things happening (especially visually - think octopus and 'Hammer time' to name a couple - but also tonally or story wise - one very big twist, that is as twisted as it gets) and some will take you by surprise. Unless you have read about them or seen the remake before this. Would be a shame, because if you only watch one Oldboy, make it this one!",10,4,11,13 June 2014
Spider-Man 2," More drama, less action
","That might not be what I/you want, that's however what you get here. And although the drama part works better here, than in the third part of Spider Man, it still feels as if it were too much, especially after repeat viewing.The drama part still works (as I wrote above) though and that is a testament to the actors. They have to convince in some partly dodgy dialogue! The action scenes are filmed well enough (nothing surprising here) and the end will leave you yearning for the third part (which is out now, in Cinemas if you didn't notice! ;o) Although who knows you might read this, after it hits the DVD shelves).The running time isn't the only thing I didn't like (the extended version feels even more long drawn-out, especially the elevator scene shouldn't have made the extended cut, it just isn't funny, but I liked the office scene with the Spider Man costume, you know which, when you see the movie). There were too many 'revealing' moments, that wouldn't work like that, not only in reality, but also in the film reality we are drawn into here! If you've seen the first one, you'll see this one too, I encourage you to do that, and then you will make up your own mind, about the great themes in here, but also about other things! :o)",7,0,1,5 May 2007
The Secret in Their Eyes," Secrets revealed
","I guess you might see some things coming. But this is not that much about the secrets (at least for me), but the journey of our main protagonist. It is about life and choices you make and how one simple choice does get you into a path you actually do not want to follow. But because it is expected of you (of what your appearance is in other peoples eyes), you keep on walking. Maybe regretting the decision while you are walking, but walking that path nevertheless.That is of course the way I read the movie. You might come up with something completely different. Or some might wait until the inevitable US-Remake hits a cinema near them (in 2012 as IMDb reveals). That this would be remade after winning the academy award for best foreign language picture, does not come as a big surprise to me. That it did win the award on the other hand, was a surprise (for me). Not because of the quality of the movie (as you can see I like it a lot), but because of the nature of the movie. Hats off to the academy for their choice.",9,2,3,24 October 2010
The Irishman," Not a theme park ride
","You may or may not be aware of what Scorsese has said. And you may or may not agree with what he is saying (let's not forget he made this movie for Netflix, but then again I reckon he would argue, he wanted to get it made and they promised to show it in theatres too). If you like his overall output though, I do hope you can watch this without judgement.I am a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but I can also appreciate a movie like the Irishman. Seeing Pacino and De Niro together is a treat. But one of the underappreciated performances in this one is Joe Pesci! Especially if you watch Goodfellas and this back to back, which I sort of did (the former at home and Irishman in the cinema).The runtime never was an issue, even if I was vary beforehand, I never felt it. Yes you can tell it's a long movie, but it never gets 'boring'. Though to be fair, some have a different threshold concerning their attention span. Whatever it is, the movie itself is not at fault as is. If you don't like it, it doesn't mean you are wrong either. It's always a matter of taste ...",10,2,6,15 March 2020
Point Break," Love or hate
","Or in that case fame. Because for fame or for that one thing you really want to achieve, you may do anything (or remake anything). Of course if you loved the original and have a shrine where you praise it everyday (ok I'm exaggerating of course, but you get the picture), this won't make your to watch list. And it will be better that way.Anyone hung up (rightfully or not is besides the point) of an original movie, will have issues with a remake. Now this is light on its feet, has great visuals and some neat effects. It also has some good looking Dudes and Teresa Palmer. It also has almost everything a free spirit would probably want to do (have to admit I haven't done any of those things, but it looks amazing - and dangerous of course). But no thrill, no fun? In this case fun and some thrill - but is it enough?",6,0,1,8 August 2016
127 Hours," Giving up
","I try to have as little knowledge about movies I am about to watch as possible. It was impossible though, to not get the one big incident in the movie. Everyone was talking about it and he even made a skit for comedy show (I think it was for Jon Stewarts Show), where it was obvious what he was going to make.But if you watch the movie, you will understand that it's not a big secret anyway. It's almost the first thing he does anyway. Though it doesn't happen. Apart from this really big incident, you might wonder what the movie will be about. And how trapped it will feel (remember Buried?). And you will be surprised that while you might feel closed in, there is also quite a few sequences where the mind wanders ... and I have to admit, I never thought he (Danny Boyle, director) would make those bold choices (visually speaking). I'm even more surprised that the Academy would give this more than one nod (though ultimately it didn't win).Very intense drama, about being trapped and not having a way out. But still having the will to live through it ... But is it enough? Watch and see for yourself",8,1,2,25 November 2011
Pirate Radio," Radio Rock Revolution
","My summary line is the German title of the movie. And yes the German title of the movie is actual an English one! But that aside it is also the name of a Radio station. A radio station that 'helped' many listeners through rainy days and nights, as it is depicted in the movie, which is romanticizing the pirate radio revolution and it's DJ and demonises, the law (portrayed by Kenneth Branagh, who seems to enjoy his part very much).Despite this black and white ideology, the movie still works, especially because of the actors. They are all great in it and the fun they had making the movie translates onto the screen. No coherent story to be found here and the premise is only loosely based on real events (that's how it feels). But it's still more fun to watch those guys rockin and rollin, then watching some other movies.",7,2,3,12 August 2009
Finding Nemo," Pixar
","A brand name, when you say it, you know you'll get quality. Their recent effort 'Up', just came out and is in the IMDb Top 100. Now that's saying something. Pixar stands for quality. For movies, that can be enjoyed throughout every generation/age. The same goes for Nemo here too! How they do it, who comes up with the crazy characters (like the turtle(s) in this movie)? I don't know. What I do know, is that they achieve what others dream of. Making entertaining movies, that have a message too. This time, it's about growing up, letting go of things you love. And all this interwoven in kid friendly environment, which still has some dark sides to it. Watch it, and be amazed!",9,0,1,21 July 2009
Blade," Brother Darkness walks at daylight
","Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! Let's start with the good things! The quote 'strong bloody violence' (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. This is not a movie for kids! Or for the faint of hearted! It has Blade as a central character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to hold/justify the action scenes! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. The action scenes are great here too.OK over to the things I didn't like. The overall story is too thin. It's enough as I've written above to hold the action scenes together, but there could be more. And a character like Blade deserves more (imo). The drama therefor isn't the best ... also it's use of clichés doesn't help. Some characters are underwritten ... That's that! :o)",7,11,15,11 May 2007
Superbad," Comedy Special
","Maybe back then you couldn't tell what would become of Jonah Hill eventually (an Oscar nominated actor, playing with/against Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio) ... actually if you told anyone back then this would happen, they'd have written that in the script, because it would have sounded hilarious.Speaking of hilarious: That's something that can be said about this movie. Of course many will start comparing this with American Pie, Porkys and what not. But the movie stands on its own two feet and has been copied a lot itself. Never to that success and never as good as 'Superbad' obviously. If you like your teen comedies to be raunchy and dirty, this is exactly your cup of tea. After watching this, you might also be McLovin (this) ... no relation to any Fast Food chain by the way ...",9,4,6,18 April 2014
Creed," Trainer Rocky
","It's not the first time Rocky leaves the gloves aside himself but does train somebody else. But it's the first time the movie is called something different than 'Rocky'. And did it make a difference? It did for Awards season that's for sure. I think we can all agree that a 'Rocky Part ...' would not have gotten as much attention or nominations as it did being called 'Creed'.So good move there, Sly, and good thinking too. Also good movie he crafted and made possible. It may tick all the right boxes and therefor seem a bit by the numbers, but why change something when it works. And while not all things are as funny as Sly may have thought (i-Cloud and so forth, aiming more for the 'older' crowd), it works overall and has a certain quality to it. And the actors are really good in it",8,0,1,26 November 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Taming the wolf
","Even the extended version of this movie (which I watched to prepare myself for the upcoming sequel) seems to have all its teeth and claws pulled. But puns aside and if you don't care that much about this being made PG-13 (the new Wolverine will have an R or unrated version released after its theatrical run), than you might be able to enjoy this Origin story.This comes down to Hugh Jackmans passion and drive. While he does act in musicals and plays too, he is able to be convincing in his action roles. The game based on this movie has much more blood in it. The story is not overwhelming, but it does do the trick. I hope the next one can be better though. It's also a shame that they did recast (L. Schreiber is the new player) for a role that has already been played (by Tyler Mane). But I guess they needed a better known 'name' for that role (it is not mentioned in the directors commentary btw.).",6,1,1,14 July 2013
Alexander," Hard to comment
","And I really mean it (the summary is no pun). I'm a loyal Stone follower and a true believer in his works. I'm also from Greece and there have been some badly executed (pun intended) or produced movies (ie Troy) about Greek history or myth. What also made the viewing experience more unpleasant, was that everybody would laugh even at the slightest homo erotic hint/visual that the movie would deliver.I could only give myself into giving this movie 7/10 by saying that it's the free interpretation of the director, that he portrayed Alexander the way he did. But then again that might be better than people thinking he might actually be from FYROM. Alexander was a Greek citizen, despite the fact that Spartans and citizens of Athens didn't like anyone from the northern Greek territory.I haven't seen the 'real DC' that will be out in 2007 (maybe it is by now available), but I don't know if I will like it better...",7,1,2,1 April 2007
Hot Fuzz," Shaun of the Bad Boys
","A good spoof movie takes the movies it spoofs literally. They show love for the movies they caricature! And this is the case here, too! Coming hot from the Shaun of the Dead success (I personally haven't seen their popular Spaced series), the boys here again aim and hit their targets!This time the action movie genre is the mark. And as with Shaun (which had the object of the zombie/horror movies), this one does not hold back. So while this is a comedy, it is indeed not something for the kids or faint of heart! Explicit violence is shown (in a blackly funny way of course, but that's not everyone's taste/liking)! Apart from the funny cast, the story/script is very well drawn out! I recommend this to anyone who likes their comedies, to be black and great! ;o)",9,1,3,20 May 2007
Constantine," One of the cooler Keanus
","You've got to love Anti-Heros, to like this movie though. Keanu Reeves character is this character! And all this is based on a comic book (or is it graphic novel? I wouldn't want to insult anyone), which of course made a lot of people uncomfortable ... with a first time director (feature film wise) and a not so popular lead actor (Keanu Reeves that is).But if you can overlook all that (prejudices against the director/star and the liberties it took with the story of the comic book), then you will enjoy a light hearted action movie. The acting is decent enough (from everyone) for an sci-fi/action movie! :o)",7,0,5,12 May 2007
Rise of the Guardians," Guardians Assemble
","To have so many (let's call them) interesting characters pushed into one movie, is quite a feat. And it is very well done indeed. Something a friend of mine kept telling me. He had seen a trailer for this movie and made me anticipate this almost as much as he did. And the movie did not disappoint! Quite the contrary, I had a lot of fun watching it and laughing throughout.I'm guessing everyone will have a favorite character, which is a great thing for an animated picture like this. A movie that not only works for kids, but also for adults. Maybe it does wake up the child in them a little bit, but that is not a bad thing now, is it? The story as it is, is not completely new (the arc of the story that is), but it does work nicely and you have a great ensemble of people with great talent. If you don't hate animated movies, you have to watch this one",9,1,1,5 July 2013
Just Go with It," Back to Square one
","Everyone who thought Adam Sandler finally got it (with Spanglish and Punch Drunk Love) a couple of years ago, may be confused why he still goes for the obvious and not challenging route of those comedies. But that shouldn't be the point here. If you go into this movie expecting an acting Sandler (can also be seen in Reign over me), you will most definitely be disappointed! On the other hand, if you go into this just expecting to be entertained, you will get the most out of it. I still couldn't enjoy it as much (it's too light, the jokes seem by the numbers, the funny side kick friend is too cliché and even Ms. Kidman feels misplaced in this) as I wanted to. But Brooklyn Decker alone is worth the 5 points. Jennifer Aniston is trying, but not as funny as she can be. The kids are as annoying as they are supposed to be (in the script). Family fun, nothing more, nothing less.",5,1,4,14 December 2011
Brokeback Mountain," More than that
","This movie is not about gay cowboys. Yes the main characters (cowboys) depicted in this movie are gay, but that's not the point. It's about a love that is suppressed, by the community, by family but most of all by themselves too. Heath Ledger's character is pretty uncomfortably with his lover.Which of course has to do with the story, that the parents reveal to Gyllenhall's character at the end. And Ang Lee knows how to capture all that. He had a little experience beforehand, when he did one cowboy movie (Ride with the Devil or something like that, you can look it up here at IMDb).And although he doesn't show explicitly what the two cowboys do together (and I thank him for not doing so, I wouldn't want to watch that), the movie stirred up big discussions around the world ... and even when people rent this movie at a video club/store, they (guys) always say that it's for someone else, they wouldn't watch that! Yes it is difficult to watch men even being in love with each other, when you're straight (I know what I'm talking about here), but if you can see beyond that fact, you will see a wonderful movie, that deserves to be seen!",8,17,21,24 April 2007
Orphan," Gives you what you need
","It's a pretty good horror film we have here. Decent, well acted a nice story. Nothing completely new or ground breaking, imho. Even a twist that has been advertised quite a lot (as I read here), isn't really completely helping (actually it serves more than an excuse, than anything else and therefor was more disappointing than anything to me personally and you might feel the same way).I couldn't decide whether to give it 6 or 7 points in my rating, but decided, that through all the things (quite a few clichés are being used, but in doing so, they make sure to use them properly), this is above average. You might not see it that way and might feel cheated by the ending (the alternate ending on the DVD is really bad though, so it's a good thing they used the one, that is in the film now). The actors do their best, that is for sure. And it looks really nice.",7,2,3,16 June 2010
About Time," Simple yet effective
","One thing you have to do, if you decide watching this: Do not care about inconsistencies. Or trying to make sense of it. There is more wrong with the internal logic that you will be able to stomach (if you go down that road). Of course the actors are able to distract you most of the time (really nice work done there), but there will be times where you're just going to go: Really? Again, try to suppress that urge and dive into the sweetness of this movie. And the fun you can have with it too. It's a romantic comedy with a 'twist' (if you want to call it that). But time travel issues have brought down other movies too. It never can be completely on the level. So cherish the notion of the fun and hop along for the ride",7,1,2,2 June 2014
Spotlight," Heard about, now see it
","Newspapers might not be what they used to be (journalism in general), but this movie reminds us of a time, when there was a code. Even if that also is just a small light (no pun intended) in the overall darkness. And there is a lot of darkness involved in this. The spotlight section of a newspaper seems to be a perfect place to do some real investigation and if you know what this is about, you know they will have their hands full to find something that they can use.Not that there wasn't enough evidence for what had occurred or was still happening. It was more a case of, people not being able to make their cases. For different reasons, be it being intimidated or paid out or other things of that nature. The acting is superb and if you have the stomach for it, you can watch some interesting features on the disc of the movie.",9,1,2,19 July 2016
Terminator Salvation," Fast Food
","I have to agree with user 'siderite', who states this as a 'decent' film. Especially considering my concerns when I heard that McG would be at the helm. I know that there are quite a few people who liked his take on Charlies Angels, but I thought the movies were ... bad and not in a good sense! But he himself said, that he evolved, plus Christian Bale was set to star in this movie. Apart from the fact, that the real main 'man' here is Sam Worthington (he is really great and you almost wish he played the John Connor part), Christian Bale lacks any kind of charisma. His John Connor only really is gripping, when he talks over a radio/communication thing. Other than that, you would be forgiven for doubting the whole Connor 'myth' (see previous movies, if you haven't) that revolves around his person.Other characters that stay in your memory, is Moon Bloodgood and Anton Yelchin (who also had a role in the J.J. Abrams reinvention of Star Trek. He really holds his own and he has too, considering the role he's playing ...Back to Bale, who had a real bad issue with the camera man (you can find an audio sample of that on the internet, maybe even here on IMDb?), where he kept swearing. If he only brought the energy he used when 'assaulting' (verbally) the DP, it would have helped the movie. But with his rough dark voice, he almost seems like a caricature of his Batman role. It's a shame, but if this and Public Enemies are the movies you see him first, you might get the impression, this isn't really a good actor. But he has proved, that he can act. 2009 just wasn't his year.The movie itself is a nice fun ride, fans should be pleased (more or less).",7,1,2,16 August 2009
Aquaman," Fluid
","Is DC getting their mojo back? Did they lose it? Or was it just the overall power of Marvel that just seemed to squash DC? With James Wan at the helm who got famous with being one of the minds behind the Saw franchise (one of the most important ones that is), there is experience at the helm. And he really brings a lot of humor into it - like the bar scene which goes against what people would expect from that.But for every scene like that, you also have a scene with one of the movies villains who is so over the top, you would suspect him to be comical (no pun intended), but he is dead serious. Shame for missing out on something that could have been really great. Jason Momoa on the other hand is having a lot of fun. And all the cast is having a lot of fun (maybe even the crazy villain in between takes, definitely not on camera). A lof women (and some men) will love this regardless of story, just being visually 'attracted' to it and that is ok. For everyone else, you can have fun with this if you don't overthink it",7,2,4,7 May 2019
500 Days of Summer," Different Breed
","There are quite a few movies out there, that try to convince you that they are not your typical romantic movie/comedy, as this movie also states at the beginning. But in this case, you can really be sure that it is different. More related to the movie 'Swingers', although quite a bit lighter, this really works great.Apart from the fact, that you have a twist right from the start of the movie (which you may know, either if you have watched the trailer or read other reviews, but I'm not gonna spoil that), this also has a very crazy story-/time-line going for it. Having really great leads helps too. While I think the time-line jumps are a good thing, some might be confused by them and might not like them at all. you've been warned!",9,0,2,25 November 2009
Concussion," You can't handle the truth
","The movie got infamous and weirdly enough not so much for what it's about (which would make sense if you consider it kind of destroys the myth surrounding one of the most entertaining sports event Americans love), but for not getting an Oscar nomination. And again, not the movie itself or the story, but one of its stars. This will go down in History as the movie Will Smith did not get Oscar nominated for.Whether my foreword made you conclude on whether you like my 'review' or not is up to you. One thing is for sure: Will Smith does deliver in this movie, he even has an accent. So yeah this is quite a few step ups from things like 'Focus' (as enjoyable as it was). You do still kind of wonder why no one is mentioning the severe consequences this seems to have on a lot of people. It's like they want to hide what this is about.Sort of things they did with other sports/entertainment programs too. See wrestling for example. So whatever your take on Will Smith is, the movie is watchable",7,2,4,20 October 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," Disaster
","Many had put Roland Emmerich in a corner. After quite a few event movies, he was being called 'US-friendly'. Not in a good sense. While you could argue about that description of his, he himself tried and went another route. He made 'The Day after tomorrow', which is anything but American friendly.Nor could you call it an 'Event movie' per se. It's more a Disaster movie in the fine tradition of the 70s. Of course digitally enhanced and looking 'awfully' (no pun intended) great, this is supposed to be a warning shot. And as it seems, Mr. Emmerich seems to like the Disaster idea, as his new movie choice shows -> 2012! We'll see what that's all about, until then we can watch this movie, which is technically perfect and has the acting chops of Dennis Quaid in it, but still lacks the emotion and the heart of other disaster movies.",6,1,2,21 July 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Edge
","This movie gave Will Turner's (Orlando) character and Elisabeth (Keira) character finally an edge, that was needed! By doing so, the whole experience did elevate and the movie became better! Of course the main reason to watch this, is still Captain Jack Sparrow! And maybe a cameo from someone ... ;o) Chow Yun Fat is the main new player in this installment and he fits right in. He plays it straight and gives us enough of a back story to excuse his participation in this movie. Other than that you have all the other players you've come to know from the previous movies ... although you soon realize (as with Will and Elisabeth) that you didn't know them as good, as you thought! There is really a great deal of things happening with the character stories, so you have to be careful to catch every development going on. But even if that's not up to your taste you can still enjoy a blockbuster, that tries to be a bit different (and achieves that IMO)",9,1,3,30 July 2007
Don Jon," Detached
","Joseph Gordon Levitt proves he can act and direct at the same time. Bringing Tony Danza back (in a different more extreme Dad role than most know him from) was a great move too. But the movie is all about JGL performance. In front and behind the camera, choosing how to cut a movie together that some might call pornography (though it isn't, it's a movie about addiction).Sex addiction is something that people take very lightly, making fun of it most of the time. But it can be more serious than that. And Don Jon proves that in a very comical way. Where Michael Fassbender went on and played it like a drama (equally good at least in 'Shame'), this movie is lighter in tone most of the time. Still having drama to sit through, but the comic moments, make this an easier film to watch. If you don't mind the sexual theme it has, you will get a powerful movie about the Downfalls of addiction",8,82,138,12 August 2013
Deadpool 2," So many walls ... torn down
","When a movie acknowledges that it is a movie being watched by people, that is called breaking the fourth wall (the one between the movie and the viewer) - that's my short definition of what you have to expect. Then again, I do hope you've seen the first one. Therefor you should already know about this. It's not necessary to have seen it, but it doesn't hurt either. You'll also be able to tell if you are into it.Because if you didn't like the first one ... why do you watch the second one? That's something I'm wondering about a specific reviewer, though I'm sure he isn't alone in this. We have different tastes so it is normal for people to dislike this sort of comedy. But if you are with Ryan Reynolds, you love this as much as he does and you will have a great time. This ups the ante and has even more jokes, even small ones, where they actually are able to have big names for a punch line hired or just a visual joke.Very funny, if you don't mind the non political correct route it takes ... because this is anything but nice ... and still manages to be sweet in its own right!",9,1,2,5 October 2018
Spider-Man 3," Watch out for the soap
","Not an actual soap of course! I'm talking about the soap elements, that run through this film (as they also did in the previous Spider Man movies by Sam Raimi). But I will go into that, later in this review!Let's begin with the credits. They are in the same style as they were in Spider Man 2, but they use another main color here (suitable for this movie). They also tell you the story so far. So even if you forgot a few things, you'll see them in the intro again. The beginning of the movie is quiet and revolve around the characters. There's a sense of danger here and there, but you're not getting the vibe that you're in a Superhero movie (which must have been intentional).Once the movie kicks off, you get great action pieces aplenty. Sam Raimi also humanizes his villains. Which isn't a bad thing per se, but not if it is done in that form of kitsch, as it's done here. Other weak points are for instance the scenes that were shot, but only were funny for the people who shot them (concerning Toby Maguire). These scenes, were just to long and lost the gag due to that.Overall I'd say not a bad movie and it certainly doesn't need the reviews here to make it's money back. But if this really should be the last, they could've done better! A little less clichés would've been nice too!",5,0,2,5 May 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," Third time's the charm
","Well actually the Marvel movies do seem to hit a quality standard, even when they change and bring new elements to it. New elements being the directors, in this case the one and only Waititi. If you haven't seen 'What we do in the shadows', I implore you to watch it. If you like dark and cynical humor that is. He really is good at directing but also acting (although his character here is animated so it's more of a voice acting job).Now the Marvel Universe has an overall arc, so it is tough to judge this without having the other movies in mind. I would say it works without any prior knowledge, but it's always better to know the other movies too. So the Universe is sort of an overlong season, although I think it's Phase 3 already if I'm not mistaken. Whatever the case, this movie is funny, has action and is an (fantasy) escape for those who are looking out for one. Don't be hating, either enjoy it or let others enjoy it for what it is",8,2,4,24 March 2018
Match Point," Anti-Hero
","In more ways than one. But still you kinda root for that guy. It's not so much the love story that is the anchor of the movie, but the self destructive way of the main character, that does attract us to the film! Some men might argue that the main attraction is Scarlett J. and I wouldn't want to disagree (optically speaking), but her character ... you have to be/feel sorry for her! Funnily enough the little detective story (thrill) at the end, does not distract from the main theme. Quite the contrary, the fact that our main character doesn't get punished for his sins (by the justice/police), but has to live with them for the rest of his life, is punishment enough!",8,2,4,24 April 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Another one for the ... desert
","As with the second one continuing where the first one left off, this does continue where the second left us. And again it does make sense, to have seen the movies that came before this one. One welcome addition (survivor from part 2) in this one, is Oded F. He really grounds things and his role seems to get expanded (though you never know in a movie like this, now do you?).He was also commenting on part 2, though I haven't listen to any audio commentary for this part (they are entertaining, even if you didn't quite like the movies ... if you liked them you will relish them anyway). But the setting is good and the tone seems to really fit the movie. There are quite a few good scenes and it is a continuation that fits with the rest of the movies.",6,1,2,30 December 2010
Midnight in Paris," Now & earlier
","I just saw a movie by a similar title (to my summary line) and I think it fits perfectly. Though I still have trouble describing the movie. I guess you know what it's about because you either have seen the trailer or read a summary of the plot, but I fortunately could avoid those things and went in without knowing anything about the movie. And let me tell you, it was great fun.Still not sure about the Oscar nods (while movies like DRIVE only got one nomination), but the movie is entertaining while not really making any sense. Or trying to explain anything. You either accept what happens or you will be left out (or you will feel that way). Very intriguing and maybe even thought provoking, this has a simple message after all. Which is not a bad thing at all",8,0,0,10 March 2012
Milk," Chameleon
","I have to admit, that I wasn't aware of the real Harvey Milk, that this movie is based on. All I knew, when I watched it (before it got it's pre-Oscar nominations) was that Sean Penn was playing the lead role. I didn't even know about the great supporting cast (if you look at the names here, it's a who's who of young and upcoming great actors all gathered here).Sean Penn is again mesmerizing and he can really make you forget all about Sean Penn, you see the character he's playing. We're talking about one of the best actors having graced the cinema screen, but even he might not be enough for some. I'm talking about the subject of the movie of course. I won't say anything about it, but let's just say, that he's portraying a person who has a pretty difficult stand in society. And the movie, although it portrays things that lie way in the past, came out at a time, when a similar problem (law) came up ... It's essential viewing, despite what believes you might have ...",8,1,3,24 July 2009
The Prestige," (Magic) Layers
","I really don't know where to start. The great production design, the fabulous acting, the great cinematography, the superb writing, the awesome directing ... I really don't know. But I do know, that this is another Nolan movie. Which kinda is a trademark or became one for me. That is why the number one movie I was looking forward in 2010, was 'Inception'.But I will get into that other movie on its own page. If you haven't watched any Christopher Nolan movie yet ... well it's almost not possible. Even if you got away from all the buzz Memento created, it's almost impossible, that you haven't seen at least one of the Batman movies he made. Then again you might not be into that sort of movies. And that's the great thing about Nolan. Making entertaining movies, that have substance.Maybe Insomnia is his 'weakest' movie (if you count the reception it got) and 'Following' was just a student film, but even those two are a showcase of his talent. But then again, I might be just a fan-boy drooling about achievements that you think are not worthy mentioning. You have to make up your own mind ... start with this mind-boggling or with any other of his movies ... Repeated viewing is almost necessary! And you will most likely want to anyway!",10,2,4,19 October 2010
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Where do we go now ...
","I'm just going to assume that you have watched Hellboy, the first movie, before you read this. I'm not going to spoil anything, about this movie. But I will talk about the characters, that are known from part 1. Hellboy himself is of course the main player, though I liked the fact, that everyone else is getting their own time and development. The actors have fun with their characters, as much as the story allows them.I think the thin line between serious statements (and decisions that have to be made) and some more lighter funny parts is handled pretty good. The sets and the Art Design is amazing to say the least. I was mesmerized at moments, almost forgetting about what was going on, story-wise and just watched the background and what was happening. I wouldn't be surprised if the movie gets some Oscars in that department! Still this crazy mix, is not for everybody.",8,1,1,30 January 2009
Cloverfield," Knowledge
","When I watched this (years after the actual release of the movie), I did know what this was about, as opposed to the people who may have gone with little knowledge into this. I still think it works out pretty neatly and even holds up after all those years. You can call this an adventure if you want to.So it is mostly pretty people doing their thing and it is 'found footage', but this never really bothered me much. I was surprised by the different endings on it. Some not that bad to be truthful, but that's up to you to decide if they chose the right one. But before that you get a tension filled movie, that could've been a romantic comedy, but has as you probably know a twist to it ... Enjoy the (well executed) mayhem!",7,0,0,22 January 2017
Silent Hill," Accurate adaptation
","I don't think that a video game has been adapted in such a manner before. It's as if you're watching the video game in front of your eyes. And although I only have played one Silent Hill, I know that they achieved to transport the game on your screen (theatre) literally!! But that is also the downfall of the movie (imo). It is very compelling in the beginning, but when it reaches a certain point (let's say the middle of the movie), the scares don't work anymore. The effects still remain great, but I'm just not feeling it. As a game that would work, because you're actively involved, but as a passive viewer, you get bored. So the best adaptation yet, shows us that there is more to the adaptation process, than filming a game ...",6,2,3,25 April 2007
Once," One
","... as in one Oscar nom and one Oscar (Academy Award if you will) win! Not so bad for a small (budgeted) movie like this one. But it's not always about the money. It's also about the actors, the (simple yet affecting) story and the heart of the movie. And this movie does have those things.Technically you could call it a musical, although it's not really (many songs, one of which won the Oscar). But it should still be a warning to those of you, who can't handle too many songs being played and/or a story moving forward through songs. Of course moving forward is a bit of a stretch. This is clearly a character developing movie, than a story developing one. If you think you can handle that and can watch a (love) story that feels real, than this movie is for you",8,0,2,5 August 2008
Ready Player One," Game mountain
","Which is what 'Spiel Berg' means translated from German into English. I guess there is a joke in there concerning the movie too. But back to this one and a first confession: I have not read the book, so my review but more importantly my rating are 'free' from any knowledge or background of that. Of course I am aware of many of the references in the movie, being a gamer myself, but also a massive fan of movies.Even so, I could not spot all of them and I'm pretty sure many out there have the same 'problem'. So if you want all of them, you probably have to watch the movie again. It might not fit in well with some of the story elements (very cliche), but it will help to keep an eye out for the references. Although for some you may want to google and find out when they come up (blink and you'll miss them).The movie itself is well made, but you knew that with Spielberg on the helm. Even if you were surprised him doing a movie like that, it still makes sense. Life is a game then ... or may become one. There is surely a lesson there somewhere ;o)",7,3,6,30 July 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Behind Glasses
","I haven't seen the original mini-TV-series from the UK, so I can't judge the movie on behalf of that nor compare it to it. What I can say, is that this movie has superior acting in it, a story that does condone repeated viewing and just enough 'action' to make it work. Why do I say the latter? Because there are a lot of people who'll dismiss this as talking heads movie. And this perception is not really wrong, because if you really want to see action and stunts and all that, than you shouldn't watch this movie.On the other hand, the talking heads do an amazing job and every nuance in their performance is just great. While you might find yourself struggling to follow the story, it all will be revealed by the end. One of my favorites of 2011, this movie has a lot going for it, tension being one of those things. Great directing job, something you could expect",9,3,5,23 March 2012
The Hateful Eight," The scope of things
","You could say this is a Western version of a children song, '10 little ...' (and whatever probably racist or at least discriminatory thing came after that in your country - it's Indians in America, which kind of seems fitting replacing them with Cowboys, mostly). And let me make clear that I did watch the 70mm longer version of the movie, that also had an Interlude. Kind of as they did in the old days ... though the movie due to it's depictions of violence would not have had a chance in the old days (playing in cinemas that is).Tarantino also seemingly making fun of people criticizing his scripts or rather the use of the 'n-word' by his characters. It seems like he listens and does care. With Madsen and Roth you have a couple of Reservoir Dogs thrown into the mix. Both terrific actors, but almost everyone is being put to shame by Russel and Jackson. While Will Smith had a great role in Concussion, the real Academy Awards miss was not nominating Samuel L. Jackson! Strangely enough Jennifer Jason Leigh did get a nomination. She's good, don't get me wrong, you just wonder, why she's the only one to get the nod from this movie.And that's because it's an overall amazing group effort. Some may feel this moves too slowly, not enough is happening. That would either mean you're not familiar with QTs work (he loves his dialog and we do too) or didn't read up on where this is taking place. Don't get it wrong though: Because when it gets violent, it really goes all the way. Not for the squeamish at all.Quentin made this feel very operatic and the larger than life setting suits the movie and the characters in it. It's a mind game and it's a words game too. But it's also about who is faster than the other person ...",10,3,7,26 November 2016
"I, Tonya"," Winter sports/soldier
","Watching this, you can see how Allison Janey won the Oscar. She's an extraordinary actress and this excessive role brought her the accolade she deserves. What I didn't realize and I'm not alone with this, the major male character in this, is played by the actor who's also in the Marvel Universe as the Winter Soldier .... Mind blowing stuff I know.And add to this Margot Robbie, who while beautiful, does not shy away of being and acting ugly. Getting down with a role like this and be sort of someone others would call 'trash' is not easy, especially in the vain group that actors are associated with. But she really did her thing and she deserved the nomination at least too. Oh and did you know that what we get here is kind of what happened in the ice skating business? It's crazy and some things are still unclear, but just the fact that this madness is sort of real (recollections of the people involved, you decide what you think really happened) ... makes you realize that not all 'based on true ...' movies are bad!",8,1,1,17 May 2018
Molly's Game," Rien ne va plus
","I know this is not about Roulette, but I hope you understand the joke I was trying to make. If not excuse the pun, though I reckon some may already have left without reading after that summary. For those who continue (thanks) let me reassure you, that the movie is about betting and about how a woman put a lot on the line - just because she could, but also because once you're on a certain track ... it's difficult to leave.Jessica Chastain has a powerhouse performance in front of her and it's funny to hear how Aaron Sorkin felt about directing a script written by ... himself. Seems like he got an epiphany. It's not that easy and it's always nice to look at another job. I just hope he doesn't think too much about it, because the scripts he wrote were all good. And don't let the fact that this is based on a true story put it down for you ...",8,0,3,12 April 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," How could this not be nominated for Best Animated Picture?
","I know it is 'performance capture' and all, but there are still animators at work here. And they did a terrific job too. Before the Oscar nominations went out, I had one clear winner: This movie as Best Animated Feature. Didn't happen, because it wasn't even nominated. Puss'n'Boots was on the other hand. Really? Nothing against that movie, it's OK, but nominated for best Picture? Really? But back to this. Not only one of the better animated (actually the best I remember seeing in 2011) movies I saw last year, but also one of the best movies in 2011 period. Spielberg did it again. I can't explain how he did it, but the movie works very well. Great comedy and action value, the set pieces work very good. I even remembered some of the comics (characters) from way back when I read some of Tin Tins comics.Of course Tintin and the other characters do have many names in different countries. In Germany he's called Tim (the Dog is called Struppi). The original name of the dog also seems to be Milou and not Snowy (though I have no clue what that would translate to). But no matter what you call them, this movie is awesome",9,1,2,13 March 2012
Ocean's Twelve," I liked it
","I know what the critics said and that many people despised this movie. But I actually enjoyed it. It's not as good as the original, but it has it's moments. And although the 'Julia Roberts' story line kinda feels like a cheat, it was nice. And I liked that they changed the central character (Brad Pitt instead of Clooney this time) for this movie!Vincent Cassel was also great, although he (or better his character) must feel cheated. As the audience did. But then again, that's the point of the movie (sort of), imho. The cast is apparently enjoying themselves! So if you don't expect a Ocean's Eleven rehash , but something more lighter than that, you can have fun with this movie. You just have to let the characters affect you ...",7,1,1,9 May 2007
Crash," Up to scratch ... and then some!
","I don't want to talk about ultimate movies or anything, but this is indeed one of the best movies made in the race/racism theme that I have seen. I really loved the movie, but still was pleasantly surprised that it got acknowledged at the Academy Awards ... nominated and won! The actors also talked very good about the movie and the way they got into. And how they even gave up their salary to do the movie. Don Cheadle even produced the movie (with other actors, see IMDb here for details), which tells you much about the actors devotion to the movie and it's story. Many stories that is, for every actor involved. I also liked that you sometimes got fooled by a scene, where you think you know where this is going, but suddenly it turns around the other way! Also characters aren't always what they seem to be ... But you have to watch the movie, a drama of the best kind!",10,0,6,3 July 2007
BlacKkKlansman," Ridiculous, scary - true
","When I first heard of the premise of the movie, I thought something many thought I guess: That's a joke and not really a movie. And I and some others who have seen the Dave Chappelle Show were also thinking about the sketch/skit he did on that show. A black man becoming a member of the Klan? I mean come on, that didn't really happen now did it? It did? Now that should have woken up your interest.If you are a fan of the Klan (and no you are not amongst very fine people no matter what the current Potus says), I'm guessing you feel anger when hearing this. Normally one should feel shame, but I doubt Klan fans will. If you do though it means, you may be on the right track and should reconsider ... you don't want to be associated with them.But back to the movie or rather the real life story. It may be heightened at places, but overall it does feel real. It's also quite funny for a serious matter like this. Which makes the ending even harder to swallow. It's not really a spoiler, though I won't say what I mean and if one is technical the punch to the gut comes from something that is 'removed' from the main story, yet very much connected. If that does not touch you ... Spike Lee was very vocal when the movie was released and talks about Agent Orange. Whatever you think of that, this movie is essential",9,14,29,19 November 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Disguises
","Obviously this plays in the Marvel Universe, so for a complete understanding it does not hurt to have seen a couple of other movies. Especially the Iron Man ones. But and that is important, even if this is the first one you're watching you won't be disappointed. And as you can see by the general rating, I'm not alone with this statement.So taking an 80s classic and putting a Spiderman costume on it ... well you get this as a result. It's a pretty solid movie and having the blueprint of a classic injected you can see why this works. It allows for something far more than just a superhero movie. I have to admit I was skeptical with Spiderman in the previous let's call it cameo he did in the Captatin America movie. It seemed like he was belittled. Even the fact that Iron Man was going to be in this one seemed like taking away the spotlight from the man (boy) who's supposed to be the star.But all of it was worries that never really manifested. Actually we have a Spiderman who walked the thin line Toby Maguire couldn't in Spiderman 3 not so long ago. Of course that wasn't entirely Tobys fault (script issues, producers influence and so forth). But it all lead to this moment, so let's take the positive ... and enjoy! Also do I have to point out there are scenes in and after the credits? The one after the credits - well let's say you'll either love it or hate it. I loved it!",9,3,6,4 September 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Winning
","Right at the start of the movie, there is a disclaimer. What we see is not something that would ever happen. It says a lot about the state of mind people were in back then. Though if you consider how fast peope are in believing stuff on social media right now, you wouldn't have guessed that we evolved ... I reckon we haven't.But it also says a lot about the movie and how it can be perceived and what attention to detail this has. Certain things and mechanisms really seem to be taken from what actually happens or coild happen behind the scenes. Bureaucracy at its best ... or worst I reckon. But with amazing actors to boost! And a triple does of Peter Sellers. There may not be any fighting in the war room, but there is also no love lost there.Funny, intelligent but also over the top, while simultaneously also feeling like it could be real. It's the end of the world as we know it ... at least on film and not reality of course ...",9,1,1,9 June 2020
Fast & Furious 6," Still going strong
","The movie is silly! The action is ridiculous! But you'll either love it or hate it. And if by now you're not sure which side you're on ... It's especially funny for me, because I'm not even into cars! But the movie and the characters we learned to love (yes even Paul Walkers ex-cop turned many other things) are there. And judging by the general vote here on IMDb, this might easily be one of the highest rated sequels and surely the highest rated entry number 6! There are a few things that even the fun part of the movie can't disguise. One of them being the relationship between Diesels character and the woman he's with. It's too convenient, not that anyone would start asking about things like that. There is also a love scene in the trailer of the movie that did not make it into the final theatrical version of the movie. It seemed too sexy anyways for a PG-13 movie.There is also a time-line thing that you have to be aware of. It's a bit complicated I guess, so while you don't have to have watched the other movies, some of them will make more sense (I think), after watching this. Especially the last one Michelle Rodriguez did (not Fast 5!). Although don't try to understand what happened there and how it's possible or anyone would think that ... well again, try not to over-think it! It's supposed to be fun! As are the action scenes! Realistic? Hell no!",8,1,4,29 August 2013
The Expendables," Due Date
","The movie we have all been waiting for. And when I say all, then I mean, those who loved the 80s action movies (including the heroes in them). And when I say waiting for, I mean since Stallone announced it. And I think it was worth the wait.Of course there is a scene in a church very early on, that is just amazing. Especially if you catch all the little things that are being said in that dialogue. Many funny lines that are just out of geek-heaven (if you don't consider geek a bad word that is ... if you do replace it with nerd!).Of course it is a shame that some people did not want to be involved in this and that someone like Gary Daniels almost got no credit when people talk about the movie. A big video star of his time it was nice to see him again. I picked him, because everyone was all over the rest of the cast and it is a shame not mentioning him. It was also nice to see Charisma Carpenter again.I only have seen the available cinema version and I'm waiting for the extended version coming sometime later in 2011. And I will be there to watch a second movie, if it gets made, of course!",8,2,5,28 December 2010
Scary Movie 2," Jokes hit their target
","I didn't quite like the first scary movie. The basic storyline there was copying 'Scream' (which originally was supposed to be named 'Scary Movie'), but didn't have anything in the story department other than that. So you can imagine my surprise when everyone was ranting about the second movie, having no story. The first one didn't have one and people didn't mind, why now? I guess it's the old, sequels must be bad (especially if they are comedies/spoofs). I beg to differ. I do think that the jokes do hit their target and if you don't mind the fact, that you do not have a coherent plot/story, you will enjoy this movie very much. There might be a few too many jokes concerning intercourse, but that's what people wanted to see at that particular time. Still no match to the great spoofs, like 'Airplane!'.",7,0,1,16 September 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Fairytale for Grown Ups
","Much has been said/written about the underlying tones in this picture. The fascist regime on the one hand, the dream(?) world on the other hand. Del Toro leaves it up to you, so everyone can decide what they make of it ...That also can be said about the fantasy world. Does it really exist or is it all in the imagination of Ofelia? I only watched the movie once, so I'm not quite sure what to make of it ... but my first guess would be that it all was a dream or an escape reality Ofelia had. I'm sure some psychologist would/could use that to analyse me ... ;o) But that doesn't matter after all, you have a really good fairy tale for adults here. Some might find it a little bit too offensive or too bloody. One thing is for sure, it's not for children.A few minor things bothered me, while I was watching the movie. Nothing of importance, but here are two examples ... When Ofelia escaped from the monster that had his eyes in his palms, she left a piece of chalk behind ... Now why didn't the 'monster' use this to come into the real world? (a logical explanation would be, my believe that it's all a dream) ... or why did the faun forgive Ofelia, that she did eat at the table? Just because she is a child? Two of the 'fairys' were killed because of that (although in the end they seem to be back again ... if that's them) ... That also could be explained, if it was all a dream ...Anyway, I might have thought too much about it. It still is a good picture, with some explicit scenes of violence!",8,2,5,2 April 2007
Final Destination 2," Next stop
","Well I can safely assume, that you have seen part 1 (if not, I will be spoiling your movie experience, because I will talk a bit about the first Final Destination). Since there weren't that many survivors in part 1, we get a whole bunch of new faces thrown into the mix here. Of course, since you have seen the first one, you know what is going to happen.Still pretty intense and very gripping, although of course not as fun as the first one. As the parts progresses, you always get another setting, where something bad happens, which someone predicts or foresees and tries to save some people (even if it is by 'accident', no pun intended). Nice new ideas of how to get rid of people, this is a fun ride.",7,0,0,29 October 2009
Blade II," Tongue in Cheek
","That's the kind of humor G. del Toro uses here. Apart from his apparent (and on the DVD Extras much discussed) affinity for a special body part, he introduces us to a new villain here. Now of course you will say, this makes sense, a new chapter, a new villain. But this is an entirely different kind of villain. A villain that will force Blade to do something he(we) never thought he would do ...Apart from the balls out action, the movie will have the tongue in cheek humor too. What it doesn't have, is a story. So yes you could dismiss the movie because of that. But why hating, if you can just enjoy this crazy wicked piece of film. That's what I did, because the movie never ever let's you think otherwise. So it obtains and stays this way from beginning to the end. So if the movie doesn't take itself seriously (and that in an excellent way), why would you want to do that?",8,0,1,11 May 2007
The Way Back," Take your time
","This is quite the harrowing experience and a journey you have to be willing to take. There is not much to enjoy here, this is pure drama on the road. But while you may feel with the characters and suffocate with the tension and the severity of their situation. When I say their situation, there is quite a group of people and it will not be easy to watch the movie and the journey overall.The casting is amazing and everyone is doing a great job. This may feel long (I guess it actually is), but it never lets up, it never loses its grip and it never ever gets 'boring'. It might not be the type of movie some like to watch, but that is a taste thing. That doesn't mean one or the other has better or worse taste. When it comes to filmmaking and capturing drama and suspense this really goes all the way ... no pun intended",9,1,1,11 April 2019
Begin Again," From the start
","Can a song save your life? Or a film about it? The former question is what the movies title originally was going to be. But lets get back to Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley, both of whom are exceptional in this. There is also Adam Levine (he plays sort of a version of himself or what the general public thinks of him and he's doing a great job too) and Catherine Keener.Put this cast together with a really good script, that actually avoids quite a lot of the typical romantic comedy clichés. You genuinely don't know where this is going. It might have to do that this is first a movie about music and then about human love. So it's love for music first and then the rest. It doesn't mean, it doesn't love it's character though. Quite the contrary! They are very nicely drawn, which makes this a very entertaining watch.",9,2,4,27 October 2014
Megamind," Not despicable enough
","And by that I am referring to the other 'bad guy' animation movie of 2010 -> Despicable me. But it might be a bit unfair to compare those too. It's not like they have the same story. Still while one found a unique way to tell the story, this here relies on the jokes alone. Not a bad thing, since they are pretty good in general. And the voice cast is doing a great job too.Kids will not mind either (no pun intended), or care if and how clever this is. It's good family fun with a little message. Predictable and caring almost completely on the main characters, this is a movie you can enjoy if you let it. I'm not sure about the 3-D though. Wasn't really necessary.",7,1,2,7 September 2011
Alien," Enemy within
","My summary line is true in so many ways - not just with the very (in)famous scene that kicks everything off. And why does it happen? Of course because of a missunderstood call to begin with - but the other one is Quarantine rules broken! Now if you read this during the 2020 pandemic ... yes I know quite disturbing and eerie. Also fodder for memes - at least for one that I have seen with the complete crew of the Nostromo.If you have issues with closed space, get paranoia and have problems with technology getting ahead of us ... well the movie will not do much to relieve you from them. Claustrophobia can be quite draining - but the set design here ... not even thinking about the low budget, this has aged quite well. What hasn't aged to well are the communication devices (same is true for the sequel). But that is really a small part of the whole experience. The special effects are amazing, the not seeing the Alien suspense much also works.This is a classic and something that while I've heard people call 'boring', is quite the opposite. Edge of your seat and a cast that is superb, an amazing script and many things just working for it. There is a reason this spawned so many sequels and it is also just great to have a female lead that is as strong as it gets.",10,0,0,19 May 2020
The Book Thief," Hidden
","If you don't mind everyone talking English almost all the time in a movie that should be mostly in German, than continue. Continue reading but also go on and watch the movie. It's drama and it has a lot of things in it that are a thorn in a lot of peoples minds. The 'old' German hymn for example. A friend of mine walked in as that played and told me to shut it. The sensibility is still there, even though this is just a movie and is needed to understand what it was like back then.The actors are phenomenal and the 'story' is really gripping. Anything that defied the odds or went against this order is always and should be considered a heroic act. Of course we know that it's easy to go downhill if you do the right thing, in a time when you are supposed to do the wrong thing. The kids are natural too and even though the movie has a long running time, it flies by real quick. There is some darkness to be encountered but you should know that ... it's obvious.",7,0,1,12 December 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," And again ...
","I'm referring to the musical numbers in this picture (yes I knew before I went to watch it, that it would be a musical, but the sheer amount of songs, weren't that apparent in the trailer). The best song is being shown in the trailer by the way (at least I think it's the best by far).Having said that and reminding everyone, that I'm not the biggest musical fan, hence the fact, that I hadn't heard of the (broadway?) musical before, nor have I seen any other movie adaptations (there seem to be quite a few, as listed here at IMDb), the movie wins me over by it's story (Love/Drama) and by the fact that it 'takes no prisoners'. Let me remind you, for those who haven't read much about the movie, that this is a 'bloody' affair (literally). If that shocks you, the fact that Sasch Baron Cohen (aka Borat/Ali G) plays and sings in this movie and delivers, might surprise you as well! Fewer musical numbers and I would have adored it",7,0,0,7 August 2008
Horrible Bosses," Over the top
","I'm not only referring to the plot, but also to our 'über-villains' on display here. It's obvious that Jennifer Aniston (first time I see her as evil as in this one) and Colin Farrell having a field day. Kevin Spacey has done similar things before, but that doesn't take anything away from his performance here.As always with comedies, quite a lot of the gags have been used for the trailer. The good news is however that there are still a lot of jokes in here, that work and haven't been used in the trailers. So while it would be good to not have seen the trailer, even if you have seen it, you will find this highly amusing.What I cannot understand however is, how they thought this should get a sequel (see IMDb, though only pro users have access to additional information at this moment). Of course the movie was successful, but still it should remain a one-off.",8,0,2,22 January 2012
The Doors," Another one
","Another Stone movie that I do review ... ;o) It's not only because I only watch Stone movies (I don't) or only review his movies (again I don't), but because he has done so many ... and I haven't even watched all of them (which might say something about me, when you know the fact that I might have seen every movie Jean Claude van Damme is in ... Talk about guilty pleasure!)Anyway let's get down to business: The Doors is obviously as the title would suggest a movie about house entrances ... Sorry couldn't resist a silly joke. It's of course a movie about the group the Doors, although the main focus lies upon Jim Morrison (played by Val Kilmer). One of the career highlights of Val Kilmer, someone who saw him here, would've thought his future had to look bright in the movie industry. Forward to today and he's more known for being difficult on set It's a shame, as he has shown (in the Doors and other movies) that he can be a great actor.I was (and maybe still am?) not fully aware of the whole Doors/Morrison story. Let's call it their ups and downs, if you will. Stone bases his movie on facts, but took the liberty of making up things, as he went along (making the film). Which is his right as a filmmaker, but something that some people didn't take that lightly, accusing him of being a liar. A parallel to another movie he did recently, about a great conqueror, where he was accused the same things ... although again he was just trying to make a fictional movie about a real thing ... And I assure you, you don't have to be on drugs to get this movie! :o)",7,1,2,6 April 2007
Black Mass," Not a Good Fella
","Even though some might have argued otherwise back then (or maybe even know, remembering that time), but I'm making more of a remark to the movie Goodfellas. Or Godfather for that matter, movies you shouldn't compare this movie too. It will always lose out in that compartment. If you can watch this for what it is (based on a real person) and can imagine Johnny Depp in something different than Captain Jack (some argue that's all he does or is able to do right now, which I beg to differ), than you will able to enjoy this.It's crime and that also has to be something you want to watch. It will get mean and it will get violent. We are supposed to learn about the person that while helpful to his community in one way, was very destructive in other ways too. Not the greatest story, but still a more than decent one",7,0,0,7 October 2016
The Town," Crime in the City
","The story as it is, did not offer me anything new. Nor was there any very clever writing, that I could spot. But it's still more than a decent effort by the makers. They chose the actors carefully and the location even more so. Sometimes the location can become a character itself and that is the case here. Even while I haven't been there myself, I can feel the weight of the town.Predictable it may be, not really having a big story or anything quite great to say either, this thriller will entertain you. If you let it that is. The flaws are there and very apparent. But I didn't feel that they were as big, as to actually driving the entertainment value of the movie down. You might feel differently of course, but try to enjoy it if you can.",8,1,2,30 December 2010
Underworld Awakening," Kate is back
","This is continuing where the second movie left off (a few years later obviously). And fortunately for us Kate Beckinsale is back in action again. Unfortunately for us, the story continues to deteriorate further down the drain. Apart from a strong character missing (I'm guessing they'd try to get the person back for a future sequel, if there ever was to be one), this tries to bring as much fresh blood into it as possible (no pun intended).Action choreography is good, cinematography is good and Kate is great as always. The new additions try their best, but unfortunately as intriguing as they are, this is very predictable fare and therefor not as entertaining as the previous efforts (minus the prequel that is).",5,1,1,3 May 2012
Closer," Really close ... too close?
","Don't be fooled by the names in the cast. Natalie Portman, Jude Law and especially Julia Roberts (if you want, you can throw Clive Owen into the mix too)! This is not your typical romantic movie. So be warned!!This is however a very true, down to earth and gritty take on reality. Relationships in the new millennium if you will. But again don't expect any romanticism! And although this sounds (and indeed is) harsh, this is what makes this movie so wonderful. It hurts to love it ... and that is exactly what you should feel while watching it. So you might despise it because it hurt, while you watched it, but that was the overall intention! Great acting then in a great story, even if you don't always understand/comprehend the characters decisions!",8,1,1,11 May 2007
Suicide Squad," Suicide Mission
","You'd expect people to say that about DC trying to place themselves as a worthy opponent and rival to Marvel. And while in the Comic Book world it is a competition, it's hard to see that in the Movie universe happening anytime soon. Which is a shame when you think that this also could've been so much better.While I've only seen the cinematic version (not the extended one), this unfortunately wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped for. Still it wasn't all bad. What was almost all bad strangely enough, was Harley Quinn. The trailer promised a lot, but apart from kind of like every funny line being in there, they didn't work in the movie itself. They felt all wrong and I don't fault the Margot Robbie for that. Also the inciting incident is so crazy, I wonder if anyone actually can just swallow that pill without going blank and kind of crazy.There are a lot of good actors involved in this and they alone warrant a viewing of this. Also the action, no matter how far fetched and stretched it may seem, kind of works too. Just do not compare it under no circumstances with Guardians ...",6,0,0,2 March 2017
Shutter Island," Insane(ly good)
","This is a thriller that builds up very slowly. Really slow, so slow, that some people got bored. And got their fangs out for the ending. That's just a matter of taste then. Even the ending is low key and will not be there to satisfy anyone (though it is one clever way to end a movie, which left me with my mouth open).Martin Scorsese might have gone thriller at least once before, with 'Cape Fear', but this time we really dig into another world. Leonardo DiCaprio pulls out a great performance once again. Even small roles are cast with great actors to really give the whole thing some weight. It's a great psychological thriller ride then.",9,0,4,9 September 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Return of the First Avenger
","Now I would like to take credit for that summary line ... come to think of it, no I wouldn't. But still the fact of the matter is, that my summary line is the actual title the movie received upon its release in Germany. Can you see them Dollar bills (or Euro bills in that case) in front of you? No you can't? There are there, because the only reason to change the title was to make it more marketable.Apart from that scheme though, this movie is better than the first one. Which I did like too (it's an origin story after all), but I understand that some weren't that fond of. It did have issues being in the past and all, but this one is in the 'now' (well after the Avengers and the other movies). There is also a TV show (Agents of Shield) that might tie up into the events of this, which I haven't seen. Marvels plan with phases and different story lines does work very neatly.I reckon it won't be long until the first will get weary of all those superhero movies, but I'm not one of them (yet). Especially because the quality is there. As with all the other movies, there are extra bits in the credits and after the credits. Nice ones too",9,1,4,15 August 2014
Capote," No doubt about the Hoffman ... ah I mean Oscar!
","Of course the Oscar for P.S. Hoffman was more than well deserved. If you had the chance watching this movie, before the academy awards were held, you kind of 'knew' that he would get it. Why? Because the first time he speaks (and if you've seen him act or in an interview before) you realise that he had become Truman Capote, this wasn't P.S. Hoffman anymore! And even if I didn't know much about Truman, I'm pretty sure this is as accurate as it could get to a depiction of this man. The struggle in him is displayed with such genius by Hoffman, that you can't imagine anybody else playing this role (although I've read that there is a comedy about Truman out, but I haven't watched that one yet).But there are other fantastic actors on display here too, as you can see in the cast list. I'm only going to mention Clifton Collins Jr.. He could have a break-out in the next few years (a big one I mean), he would've deserved one. First movies I watched with him, he called himself Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez (another stand out role, is his turn in One Eight Seven - 187).This movie is 'quiet' and long at places, so that is a let's say final warning for people who are not into this kind of movies! ;o)",7,1,1,23 April 2007
Life of Pi," Living the life
","I haven't read the novel this is based on, so I can't really compare the book with the finished movie. But I can say that the movie takes you on a journey. Something that has to be seen to be believed. Also one of the better 3D movies out there. This may rely on it's special effects, but never stirs away from the human story/emotion it tries (and successfully) conveys.It's also not too sugarcoated, showing animals like they are and not a cute version of them. Of course one could argue that maybe it's not the animals, but ... well if you've seen the movie, you know you can put a different layer on it and it works great. You can either enjoy the beautiful scenery and nice pace or see this as more ... it can be inspiring if you're in the mood for it ...",8,0,2,2 May 2015
Ocean's Thirteen," Fun light movie
","As the first one was or more in the spirit of the first installment. I did like Oceans 12 too, but this goes in the direction of the first one, with a few surprises here and there. I have to admit, that I didn't count how many 'friends' Ocean had in this one (were there really 13?) ... But then again, does it really matter? I don't think so personally.A brief introduction of the new villain this time around shows him as an evil man. But for some people (a friend of mine in particular) he wasn't evil enough ... I can see why he says that, because Al plays it a bit more subtle than Andy G. did in the first movie. Still Al is phenomenal in my book, including this movie! It's nice to see that the cast still winks at the audience from time to time and has still to do things (like Pitt eating in almost every scene) ... it's just great fun to watch them!",8,1,4,28 June 2007
Tangled," Disney tangled with Pixar
","Since Pixar has taken over creative control over Disney projects, they have gone up. Not only financially but also creatively. And it shows in the outcome of this movie too. While there might be a musical number or two too many in this one, they are still pretty rare. And if you can endure them, you will be treated to a very funny movie. With animals that might not sing (or talk for that matter), but do have a mind of their own nonetheless.And it's the animals that almost outshine the human (drawn) cast. But while the story is predictable, you will find yourself cheering for the all the right reasons (if you are not too pessimistic that is, of course). Or too cynical. It was the last movie I watched in 2010 in cinemas and I was not disappointed!",8,3,6,20 January 2011
Doctor Strange," Mixing it up
","The great thing about the Marvel Universe is that they keep mixing it up. I'm someone who's not as aware of all the story lines or heroes that exists. I never read Doctor Strange for example, so I did not know what to expect. And I guess you can say it's the superhero version of Inception. It is definitely something that we haven't seen before in a Superhero movie being done.And the casting is superb too. You know the effects will be great, they have the money to invest in that. If you don't have an aversion against Marvel and/or are a total fanboy of DC (I myself like Batman a lot and yes also the version Ben Affleck is portraying), you will have a lot of fun watching this. There are scenes even after the movie is over. By now everyone should know that ... and yet still some leave or stop the movie when the credits start to roll",8,1,1,17 June 2017
Interstellar," Out of this world
","A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...",10,6,13,31 May 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Searching for ... aka the truth is out there
","We know in real life that it's not easy to solve a crime. And this movie is as real as it gets. The characters in it are stubborn, are faithful to their believes, are passionate and most of all flawed. Even Frances character, while fighting for something good, goes overboard at times. And the movie or other characters let her know about it.The viewer also acknoledges of course. And the cast is more than impressive. You can feel every emotion and you can also understand motivation, even if not every viewer would act exactly the same way. There is humor in this, but this is more drama than I actually thought it would be. And even a seemingly thin sketched character like the one Sam Rockwell is playing has its merits ... just stick with it and you'll be rewarded",10,1,4,11 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Is it over?
","I know that many have waited for this. And I can tell you they were way more excited than I was. I have watched the Star Wars movies and I am not as big a fan as many of them are. I don't dislike the movies or the franchise. I just never was as big a fan as many were. One of the reasons is, I never had the experience as a kid. So while I totally get what some feel about them, and I respect that, I hope the same is attributed to me and my views.Having said all that, the movie is what one should and could expect. With some twists that may not make much sense, but get the thing to the intended ending everyone was ... well at list wishing for. Not exactly as it happens here of course, but still. You can't make everyone happy, that is just not possible. So this is either religion for you or just plain fun for a couple of hours. The director tried his best to please as many people as possible, which might not be necessarily a good thing ... but there you go",6,1,7,29 March 2020
Pacific Rim," (not) Hit & Sunk
","I was surprised that this movie didn't do well at the Box Office. Not only because it is done by Del Toro, but mainly because it is really good. And it seems people like it generally too (see rating here on IMDb, currently ranking at 7.6). So why didn't it perform? Tough to say, but seems like people didn't want to watch it at that time, so maybe the release date was off.You can't tell with those things though, so I'm pretty sure this will do much better once it hits the video stores/markets and sells/rents like crazy. The movie deserves that. And not because it is a great movie, but because it is very entertaining. Predictable and filled with clichés, Idris Elbas performance alone is worth the money! Sit back, relax and enjoy the show",7,7,11,31 August 2013
American Sniper," Controversial?
","Yes it is. But we're talking about Clint Eastwood here. And while he did talk to a chair (something I actually thought was funny as an 'act', not so much what he was saying), he's still a good director who's able to juggle things around. And make them feel right - or as right as it is possible.Many have and will call Snipers cowards. People who are not going into actual fight that is going on, but wait and have to kill a lot of people from long distance. But we do get a glimpse into what might be going on in the head of one of those men. Bradley Cooper is once again mesmerizing in his portrayal. And while I was not aware of all real life incidents that happened, that might have elevated the whole story for me.",7,1,6,3 July 2015

","Anne Hathaway is on her way to grown up roles. And she seems to be on a good way. With this, Brokeback Mountain and a little less movie called Havoc. It will be interesting to see, where she goes from here then!But the real treat here, is of course is Meryl Streep. She is fantastic as a sadistic, ruthless cold as ice editor! Anee Hathaway gets great support from Emily Blunt. Who's also great here. Then you get the excellent Stanley Tucci as a mentor and you're set to go! The story of the naive girl facing this kind of difficult task isn't new, but it's played out nice here. Which mostly relies on the acting chops of the cast you got here. Watch it for them alone and see a nice story develop ... :o)",7,0,1,9 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Workout
","For your behind that is. The second (actually is the 5th film Lucas shot) part/Episode of Star Wars has a running time of over two hours. That's something you have to sit through and I don't even go into the romance part (which is much criticized by many), but I will go into the CGI this time.And that's all because of Yoda (in Episode IV - VI he was a Frank Oz Muppet)! There is especially one scene at the end of the movie, that 'kicks *ss' and is worth your while alone! And one of the reasons I rated the movie higher, than I myself would've thought. This scene (which I won't spoiler, if you haven't seen the movie yet) is also the reason other people disliked the movie ... So maybe I'm a bit too euphoric, but I can't help it! (other than that, there is not much to say about acting or character development imho)",7,0,2,20 May 2007
Corpse Bride," Beautiful/Scary
","Well maybe not so scary, more creepy from times to times. But only in a good way. This movie is yet another great fantasy tale from Tim Burton. And it seems, that he has special skills for fantasy tales. Skills that seem to go amiss, when he's shooting Sci-Fi movies, but that's another story.Let's concentrate on this movie, a fairy tale starring his favorite actor Johnny Depp. But since it's an animated movie, it's his voice you'll get to hear. And since it's animated, Mr. Burton can again relish in big faces and big eyes. Something he is very fond of (maybe from the time he worked at Disney? I don't know, could be, despite the fact he left Disney as young frustrated animator). But it's the story that will get you excited, it's very crazy and seems to be in the same vein as Edward Sciscorhands!",8,0,2,10 July 2007
Lion," A long way to go
","This is not only meant literally but also in the process of growing up, communicating and generally finding peace. Be it with the persons near or next to you or within yourself. And we get to experience this amazing journey based on real life. Now I'm as much a cynic as the next person (if that person is a cynic), but the real life inspired theme of the movie is working quite nicely.The acting is really good and you do wonder where all is going and even relationships are easily explained and understood. You can see where the main character is coming from. And yes he is flawed, but who wouldn't be after all he went through? And we get to experience those things as if they were happening to us. A real tour de force as they say - but satisfying overall. And emotional as can be ... don't be ashamed if the movie brings that out in you",8,0,0,22 August 2017
Gone Baby Gone," It's out there
","I haven't read the novel, so I can't tell you how accurately it is to the book. But I can tell you that you have a very gritty story here, with a strong cast (there's even an Oscar nomination for Best supporting actress in there). Casey Affleck is great in this one too, although if you haven't heard him before you might be surprised by the sound of his voice! The slow (burning) pace of the movie/drama, works completely in it's favor and Ben Affleck shows that he can direct a movie. Even without his buddy Matt Damon. If you like your drama raw and natural looking/feeling, than you should watch this movie too.",8,0,0,24 February 2008
"Monsters, Inc."," Wanna see something really ... not so scary?
","Trust in Pixar when it comes to kids movies with unconventional stories behind them. Who'd have thought that a movie about Monsters could be kid friendly? Pixar apparently and it does work quite well. I haven't watched the recently (conviniently released just before the sequel hit the cinema screens) re-vamped 3D version of the movie, but I'm pretty sure they did a good job on that too.Whatever that looks like, I can attest that the 'normal' 2D version does look great. But it's obviously the movie that counts and that is a good one too. Not so much relying on Minions or other sidekicks, this based on the friendship of two Monsters. A really good movie both for the older and younger Pixar fans.",8,0,1,31 August 2013
Southpaw," Big Impact
","Depending on how successful the movie is on selling you the relationships in the movie (it did work for me and judging by the overall rating, most of whom have seen it), this will have an impact on you, even though it does have clichés lined up all the way until the end. Still there are things that do hurt, especially if you invested and because the actors are doing a really great job of selling it.It does obviously and as stated not redefine the Box genre (if you call it genre, maybe niche or something like that would be more suitable), but it does what a movie of its size and merit is supposed to do. It takes you on a journey and it stays suspenseful all the way through",8,0,0,6 September 2016
Ant-Man," Another Fantastic effort
","How can you do a really good movie about a man who transforms into a little man? How do you make it accessible to people who are not aware of the comic world, but also keep it real with the fans of the Marvel Universe? Well Marvel seems to have all the right answers to that. Generally speaking that is, because as always, there will be people who might not like this at all.But the acting in this, is superb! Getting Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd in the two main roles is genius. Also Evangeline Lilly, who is not Lost anymore. The comedy timing, the story telling, the little things that make this movie work, are all elevating it to an experience you can have, that is a fun ride. Something movies should be, if they are aiming for it.Because this is not meant to solve world problems, this is not meant to be a heavy drama, this is meant to be what it is. And by those 'rules', it expands the Marvel Universe ... can't wait to see what's coming up next (Phase 3 has started)",9,8,19,12 October 2015
21 Jump Street," Not simple nor too sentimental
","Though the second one is a bit of a guess, since I have never seen any episode of the original TV Series. But this one is really trying to do something new. With the same name (or title if you will), but with a really hard R rating. Not sure if there will be an unrated version, but I guess they'll do that too. Even so, the movie was successful enough to warrant us a sequel. I doubt that Jonah Hill or Channing Tatum would be up for a TV show.Then again, they could replace them or bring new characters into it and make a running series out of it. Question would be, what TV channel they'd go? HBO or something similar or the PG route? But that's speculating, back to this movie, that might have been another reason GI Joe 2 got pushed back. Channing Tatum seems to be on a hot streak right now. His female and male(?) fans would say it's long overdue I guess. But he pairs up good with Jonah Hill and they work great together.",8,1,2,16 July 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Gotta take a stand, it don't help to hide
","You might recognize the summary line as part of the theme song Hulk Hogan had (Real American). It does fit with the movie too, of course. Our main character is someone who is taking a stand and does not want to hide. Even against all odds (and if you haven't seen the trailer or read the comic books, you'll be surprised by them!) he still is motivated like nobody else.Of course some might have trouble finding his inspirations. But that is not that point. It's also not good trying to figure out if technology that is shown in the movie actually existed back then. First of all, this would have been secret anyways and nobody would have known about those things and secondly: It's a movie. If you think what is shown in here is history (though it might take a few historic elements into the storyline) then you are sadly mistaken or too young to understand. If the latter ask an adult or better yet: Read a book/watch a documentary.The fact that the movie is a period piece might also be one of its downfalls (boxoffice wise that is). That and the fact that people seem to have seen enough comic book movies contribute to the fact, that this hasn't been received so well. Other than that, this is in no way inferior to other comic book movies that made more or less money than this.I liked it a lot and although you don't get a real tag-scene at the end (something we have grown accustomed to with Marvels heroes), some did get very excited by what followed after the end credits rolled: A glimpse at the Avengers movie.",8,2,4,16 January 2012
American Hustle," American Lining/Line-up
","Actually it's not really American actors playing all those roles, but I tried something witty with the summary line. Something witty is also what Russell is trying to do and it's not his first time. If you consider Three Kings and I (heart) Huckabees and what he has delivered the past few years you can't help but notice a director getting better by the minute (movie).It's not easy to juggle a movie about con artists, especially when it feels like it's build entirely on something that really happened (which apparently isn't the case, which makes this even more intriguing). But whatever the case and however you feel about some of the actors, this is brilliant. For one I do love Jennifer Lawrence, but the character she is playing could not be more despicable and appalling in my eyes. So while I'm still very fond of Lawrence herself, she (and Russell) actually made the impossible possible! I kind of hated her.There is a reason why there was Oscar buzz and nominations and what not. I know I myself get sometimes tired of buzz like that. But Russell is one to look out for and I for one cannot wait for his next movie. Whatever it is, it will be good ... whether I like it or not",9,2,7,2 August 2014
The Godfather: Part II," Back and forth
","Not only the arguments if this one is better than the first Godfather (Godfather II has been used by many as an example that sequels can be better than the original movie), but also the time line of the movie. So while this is the first movie that includes Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in one movie, the time line constraints did not allow for them to be in the same scene (wouldn't make any sense, you'll understand when and if you have watched the movie). Also De Niro won an Oscar (funny fact, for the same role/character Marlon Brando won one in the first Godfather, must be a first and I don't know if it happened again, doubt it though) while Al Pacino didn't. And while it may seem unfair to Pacino, it was more than well deserved for De Niro, who really merged himself into the character that Brando created. From the way he talked, to gestures to mannerisms. Everything is there!But the movie won a few Oscars and the acting was really good too. The story continues (though gives us a few flashbacks) from the ending of part 1. So while the first one is conclusive and has a satisfying ending itself, the story could be continued. Especially with the original author on board (Mr. Puzzi). There are new themes introduced in this movie. One big one is loneliness. And it's not only about being alone when you have power or being the Godfather. As with the first movie this explores quite a lot of things in Gang related family living.A great movie that was even longer than the first one (and the sequel that came after it). But you probably won't mind the length. Especially if you buy into the drama, that really works. And even without it stating the time jumps/leaps it makes, you'll get the (time) change on your own. A great sequel to a great movie",9,0,2,4 February 2013
The Bourne Ultimatum," Action seen/scene
","The third and last part of the Bourne trilogy (duh), is lacking a bit in the story department, but covers it with extensive action scenes! Twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better.The director and star (Damon) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced story-wise. How they got around that? The action scenes, for once, but they did another thing too, which I can't reveal, because that would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, than you'll notice it! Funnily enough I read, that this adaptation of the Bourne books is the least accurate of all three films .. if that means anything to you :o)",8,1,1,10 October 2007
10 Things I Hate About You," Looking back
","Looking back, this movie had a pretty (no pun intended) decent cast. The now deceased Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles as front runners of course. It is a pretty good romantic teen comedy, that is pretty nice. And that's saying something, if you consider the fact, that it came out the same year, American Pie was.While the latter was a pretty gross comedy, that still had heart to it, this is more the classical approach to a teen comedy. Something that hasn't been done that much after '10 things...' came out. Which obviously lies within the fact, that it's pretty easy to slide down the cliché road and wind up boring people more than entertaining them. But which also states the fact, that this is pretty decent and a nice addition to the teen rom-coms!",6,0,0,21 July 2009
Rush," More than fast cars
","I have to admit, I never thought I'd be really convinced by this movie. I don't really have a keen interest in the Formula and only really know Lauda, but even his story was not one that I could recite or anything. It might have helped or not, but I can say, that this drama is more than just a movie about two fast drivers.It's also a duel that takes place with two different life styles, two different characters. Daniel Brühl might be German, but his performance as Austrian racing legend Lauda is his best to date. Ron Howard knows how to make movies and this is another showcase for that. Because while this does focus on the drama and the life story, you still get racing scenes, on and off the tracks. Men will be men, I guess ...",9,3,4,2 June 2014
Nightcrawler," Extending your minutes of fame
","There are not many actors who can do that creepy thing and still pull the viewer in. Don't get me wrong the script is amazing too, but you need someone like Jake Gyllenhaal to pull the main role off. The movies pace is slow though and this might not be exactly what everyone will love. You have to be patient and you have to go through tough scenes and character drama to watch this.It's a man on a mission thing and the question that can be raised is: Chicken or egg? Who's fault is it really? Because you do get pressured into certain situations which make some people break. Especially if they were on the edge anyway ... or over it a long time ago ... Whatever the case, be prepared for some tough watching ... literally.",9,0,1,12 April 2015
The Aviator," Too long
","It just is too long. And although I think Martin Scorsese should've gotten his Oscar for another movie than this (so the decision was right not to give him one here imho), I also think he made better movies than Departed. Then again Departed delivered and satisfied more than this!The acting from Di Caprio is good (much better than in Gangs), although some of the scenes (or better the script) seems to let him down. Even a scene in a cinema hall, really happened (the movie is based on real characters, fyi if you didn't know already), it just didn't translate that well on screen, imho! And the real characters? I do think (and I'm not the only one, as friends of mine have told me), that some actors/actresses have been miscast. The fact that I'm not fully aware of all the H. Hughes stories shouldn't make a difference in my viewing pleasure, but then again they might have made this experience a bit lighter (and heavier at the same time, because of the length) for me ... Not a bad movie/biopic by any mean, but nothing I was excited about afterwards either!",6,3,8,12 May 2007
Oblivion," They cloned Tom Cruise?
","That might be a question you'll ask yourself while watching this. It is incredible how you he looks in this one. Or maybe Scientology actually discovered some youth serum after all. Which brings us to the elephant in the room. I don't think you can necessarily see this as a Scientology project (which can't be said about After Earth, but that's an entirely different topic, discusses over there).The movie itself is simple and clear and it works. I was surprised at how decent they made it. And I don't mean the technical aspect, because that is just amazing. Though I imagine they did use a lot of money to make those effects work. Worth it of course. And maybe Cruise's face is an effect too. Whatever the case, there is action, there is sci-fi, drama and a love story. So you kinda get everything. Oh and mystery too!",6,0,0,20 August 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," What a performance
","If Imdb had a performance rating - well Remi Malek would have gotten a 10/10 from me. Now still let's adress the elephant in the room: is this correct in all of its portrayal when it comes to Queen? No it is not. There are quite a few things that are ... let's call them artistic freedom changes. So if you are not hardcore about those things and can accept these things, then you will be treated with something really amazing.The performances are great and the story is quite incredible. Yes some things seem like cliches, but that's how stories go. Well probably except the one about Elton John coming in 2019 (Rocketman), which I also look forward to. But this is about Queen and as controversial as Mercury was, almost everyone knows the songs he and Queen created - I guess there might also be some questions about who came up with what song and not having Mercury around answering those questions, the remaining band members answered them - do you believe all of them? Whatever the case, it should not ruin the movie going experience for you. Sit back and just let the movie and (not so much accurate) history take over! Marvelous, splendid and quite extraordinary!",9,1,1,6 May 2019
Bird Box," Who let the Birds out??
","If like me you haven't read too much about the movie and its story, you will find yourself on a trip - to slowly discover what is what. Some things are more apparent than others and should be clear to the viewer before they are fully revealed during the natural course of the movie. And when I say natural course I mean, the back and forth it takes timeline wise.Because while we start in the 'now', the movie backs off and shows us the then and the inciting incident. Actually the then is a far bigger part of the movie than the now. But that should not take anything from your enjoyment, quite the opposite. Even the knowing of certain things does not fully take away the impact the actual reveal of them will have. Nicely told and really well edited, this is suspensful and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Don't expect it to answer all your questions though ... this won't happen",8,3,6,26 March 2019
American Pie," A new era
","With American Pie a new era of Teen comedies began. In the Porkys tradition (sort of), this revitalized a sub-genre, that seemed derived of new ideas. But the mix of characters, their story (promise/oath to each other) and their embarrassments to achieve said goal(s), a new breed was born.While the showing of flesh (naked body/ies) seemed to be a problem for the censors in America, the movie got a '12' (equivalent to the PG-13 in America) rating in Germany, in it's 'unrated' form. Some of the stars seemed to have a bright feature ahead of them, but most of them didn't do anything. The most popular one, although not represented much in the first installment, was Sean William Scott (aka Stiffler). Shannon Elizabeth and Co. kind of 'dissapeared' after a while and don't seem to make many movies nowadays.But that doesn't take away the fun that you can have with this movie. So if you're not too prude, just go ahead and watch this. Despite all the sexual gags, this still got a heart",7,0,1,21 July 2009

Not to mention, that maybe finally people will stop comparing 'Fargo' with the much superior, but also quite different 'A simple plan'.If you haven't seen Fargo, this movie is a comedy, with very strange characters. Maybe you could also say, very silly characters. It has been quite some time, since you last saw Brad Pitt playing/acting like that. He can pull it off though, which might come as a surprise to his Blockbuster audience, who might not have seen his earlier small work (see True Romance, where he has a blink it and you'll miss him appearance).All in all, very funny, with an ending, that might leave people a little confused, but then again, so did 'No country for Old Men' ...",8,2,6,19 April 2009

","The user Jeff-1813 (or was it 1318?) has a great comment about this too. He gave it only 1 star, but I'm going to bash this one like he did, too! Let me explain what I wrote in the summary line. It isn't for the kids, because you shouldn't let them watch something badly executed! See editing, character development etc. etc., although I should've said, look how bad/non-existent those things are. Just because they're kids doesn't mean they have to watch bad movies.Adults shouldn't watch it, because it's not coherent (plot), pulls it's punches (see action scenes and/or the 'editing' of those) and has lackluster acting to top it all! Yes even big names can have a bad movie here and there. What must(?) have sounded/read like a great fantasy movie, didn't translate on screen! The movie checks all things a fantasy movie should have (you could say it's by the book), but it also feels like that, or better it feels like nothing! There's no compassion for any of the characters, just an emptiness!",2,2,6,1 March 2008
Watchmen," Great adaptation
","I hadn't read the graphic novel, before I went to watch the movie. But I did read it after wards and I have to say, that the adaptation was really great. I for once loved it, even if a few things are missing from the novel. Those things (a side story mostly) will be reinstated into the movie in a future Blu Ray/DVD release, but should be available as stand-alone disc also.Apart from that side story, the ending is slightly different to, than in the novel. But I liked it, actually I liked every choice he made (even small costume changes, like the one Night-Owl went through) and I liked the actors in it too. Because I wasn't aware of the novel, the movie began with quite a 'Bang' for me. I only had seen pictures of the characters up to that point and was kinda shocked, with how the movie began. In a good way of course. I can only recommend this movie, even though I know that not everyone enjoyed the movie (my niece and her friends weren't too excited about it, as they told me later). But if you like your movies to be daring and controversial, not to mention mature and at least a bit thought provoking, then you should watch this or at least read the graphic novel!",10,2,7,27 July 2009
The Bourne Identity," An ending that spoiled most of the fun
","... I had with this movie. Now I won't get into any kind of 'spy' discussion in the sense, that this is how Bond should be like or how 21st century spy movies should be made. Because seriously, if every other movie would be alike, that wouldn't be cool/good, now would it? Diversity is a good thing! Now this movie can hold up to any espionage/spy thriller that is out there. Matt Damon does fit the Bill here and it all (especially the story)moves along quite good! That is until the end ... this was so incoherent with the rest, which was innovative, in contrast to this cliché ridden section, that it felt to me like a cheat. Of course they had to come up with something, but I'm sure there were better ways to exit the movie ... That's why my rating for the movie failed to be higher!",6,0,1,10 October 2007

There is a lot of cool character moments - some may feel things being uneven, especially concerning characters or some of the violence, but I'd argue it's consistent most of the way.The only thing I thought brought the movie almost to a stop, was the romance side story going on. Of course this is a very important part to the story and the motives of our Driver. But at times it felt like a completely different movie and not in a good way either. But this all is not really in the way of a really cool movie. A movie that is light in tone and yet still violent when it needs to be. For some it even will reach Cult Status ...",8,2,11,4 September 2017

Not at all and that is because there are quite a few flaws, that are nicely hidden, if you just go in and shut off your brain. And I don't mean that in a bad way, because if you do that, you will be able to be entertained by this movie. So new characters (quite a few, if you don't count an after credits scene in a previous movie) are being introduced here.And I get it that many people who care don't like how things are being rushed. It's almost like DC feels they have to push fast forward, to keep up with Marvel or reach the level the other universe is in right now. Which does not work in their favor mostly. On the other hand, the movie was quite succesful and it didn't matter that many things didn't make much sense. Light humor and everything included ...",6,0,0,24 March 2018
Man of Steel," Up in the air
","I'm still not sure how to feel about this. And it's not about the story and I'm not (was not) a big fan growing up. So I'm not comparing this to anything else than the previous movies that existed rather than the comic books. That it's way better than Superman returns is something that could be expected. Especially because Chris Nolan was involved as producer, though that also meant the fun/camp feeling of Superman went out the window (without the flying abilities of our Superhero at hand here).The (main) problem I had watching this, was the action scenes. It did feel like I was watching someone play 'Mortal Kombat' or Street Fighter. Going through walls, jumping like digital Yoda on drugs, that kind of thing. The story is pretty straight forward though something we are not used to seeing in Superman movies. Will have to watch it again I guess",6,4,8,29 August 2013
Grease," Light entertainment
","Don't go into this expecting another West Side Story or anything that has a big social commentary written all over it. Watch it if you like Musicals in general, but still keep in mind, it might not be as elaborate as other Musicals have been. Watch it especially for the songs, which are very good.And while I'm not particularly a Musical fan, I have to admit that the songs were really good (and you may have heard a few of them). Strong songs and performances and quite raunchy for a movie of that time. There is a scene with the girls (I won't spoil the content of it), that I'm sure got the censors all riled up.A light musical that is there to entertain you, if you let it (with a few actors that became more known later on and I'm not only talking about Mr. Travolta).",7,0,1,29 December 2010
28 Weeks Later," Later but still not wiser
","As far as the action/suspense goes, a 7/10 would have been more appropriately. But as far as the common sense and the plot holes are to be taken into that account/rating, than a 6/10 is still a good rating in my eyes.Let me explain. Apart from the obvious 'let's shake the camera to create some tension/horror', which made me more often nauseous than really scared, quite frankly, the real let downs in this movie are the plot holes and the portrayal of the military. Now I'm not a military guy myself, but to portray them in a manner, that not only makes them look stupid -> SPOILERS: they let the kids get out of the military zone just like that ... oh and how convenient, that they find them exactly at the time when they themselves have found their mother! Not to mention the unguarded mother back at the military zone, where anybody can walk into, to get infected! It's open (mad) house ... enough already! Seriously, this does spoiler a lot of the fun, one can have with the movie ... or could have had, in that case. As for example the introduction in the movie. The guilt ridden father is a great theme, that runs throughout the movie. And the whole beginning is shot in a really great way. But as I said, it doesn't hold up to that unfortunately.And yes the ending is quite clear ... although still some people try to make sense of it. It doesn't matter (SPOILER again, watch out, don't read if you haven't watched the movie, I'm going to talk about the ending), how the pilot got infected or how the helicopter crashed ... it's just a scheme to set-up a possible '28 months later' (or whatever it will be called)! So Paris, here we come!",6,2,3,10 October 2007
21," It's slick alright
","'21' is a decent movie. It delivers on it's promise, nothing more and nothing less. Of course it's always a positive thing, to have Kevin Spacey in your movie, it's always Quality improving. But that doesn't change the fact, that this movies plays out 'by numbers' (no pun intended). You can see the characters developments from a mile off, can sense the plot/turning points before the movie has begun, so there's little left to really surprise you.The intentions and the acting is good, but you can have only so much fun with it. And being good with numbers isn't always really attractive. The movie would've been better, if it had tried to make something new, but even the ending will most likely leave you emotionless/not caring. Don't even try to compare it with the really good movies, that have been done with that (or a similar premise) ... your vote would be lower than mine right now",6,1,2,7 August 2008
The Revenant," Can you bear it?
","Puns aside (and I can only guess that you at least heard about the infamous scene I'm referring to), this is a rather gruelling and very violent movie. It really is very visceral and you will see things that are commonly attached to either horror movies or violent action movies. But it is necessary to go all the way to show what characters have to endure and go through at certain points.So the viewer can really feel what is going on. No matter how hard it is to watch that is. And Leonardo Di Caprio did win an Oscar. Finally his fans will say. Though even they admit, it might not be his best movie or rather best performance in a movie. But that's not what counts. What counts is the journey and the fact he did deserve one overall speaking. It's a bleak movie and it won't be everyone's taste, but once you cope with what's happening you will have enough tension to hold you until the end of the movie",9,0,2,26 November 2016
Trouble with the Curve," Feeling and hearing it
","I didn't think Clint Eastwood would star in a movie he doesn't direct anymore. Actually I never thought he'd star in a movie period. Then again Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake are there to support him. And if you look at it closely it's more an Amy Adams vehicle. Still the daughter-father relationship is explored in major detail here. And it works for the movie as well, even if it sometimes feels a little clichéd.I'm not that familiar with the game as most Americans are, but the theme of technology against human is not uncommon. And it shouldn't surprise when you have Clint in the movie either. There is drama and there is comedy, but everything is carried by the three mentioned performances. They are believable and if you can dig the story, you will like the movie too",7,2,2,22 July 2013
Bridge of Spies," Bridging the Gap
","But it's either a very big gap or a very big bridge (or maybe both). So to some this may feel too long. What it definitely is true, is the fact that the movie takes its time to tell the (true) story behind it all. While Spielberg probably took some liberties (as almost every filmmaker does when they tackle a true life story/incident), this is very interesting and tense stuff.Though you wouldn't know when looking at the main character (besides the one Tom Hanks is playing), because of him underplaying everything. Was the real person like that? Haven't read much about that, but the movie may take a couple of people to take a look into that. And for that, the movie achieved what it wanted: Putting a spotlight on something not many are aware of. Spielberg and Kaminsky always deliver when it comes to settings/camera of course, acting is great too, so it's kind of a 'no-brainer'",7,1,1,20 May 2016
Pitch Black," Mystery Man
","I just re-watched this, to refresh my memory. Riddick 2(or part 3 of the Pitch Black trilogy if you will) was about to start in the cinema and I only had watched the first one over a decade ago. The film still holds up! It's the character portrayed by Vin Diesel that makes the movie more than worthwhile. It's actually the mystery surrounding the character, not knowing what he's really up to and if he has moral values or where they lie.While Riddick does takes stabs at religion, the director and the movie itself do not really show any indication they have anything against it. A science fiction movie that tries to please a part of the audience. But don't be fooled, this is as raw as it can be. You won't and shouldn't get too comfortable. While there wasn't any money to speak of (budget wise), the movie does look really good. The theme here is darkness. And it looks good/clear enough for my taste! Raw and violent like Riddick himself, you'll either be with him or ...",9,0,2,13 September 2013
Split," Right down the middle
","Splitting hairs is nothing compared to this. Of course Split refers to our main character. Although M. Night has had some diverse reactions on his last outputs. But mostly people did like this and it almost seems like he made a comeback. If you thought he vanished that is of course. The script is tight and the movie has a lot of memorable moments (most of them being weird), although one of the biggest can be seen in the trailer, which is unfortunate.There's also another scene where M.Night can be seen. His Hitchcock moment as some call it (I think he himself too). Letthis argument not spoil the fun you may be having with this one. The overall acting is good (apart from the one cameo I just mentioned, which is cringe-worthy) and the tension is there until the end. And after it, because there is a stinger in the credits ... a nice one at that too!",8,11,22,22 June 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Trade Hallow against Horcrux
","I haven't read any Potter books and I do not know how it will all end (the last book has been out for awhile). But I do know that the movies have grown up, as have the fans of the movies. The last book has been filmed as two parts and part one has been released in 2010, while the last episode will come out in 2011. And I might have to re-evaluate this one after watching the end.The end. This will be a sad day for many people. Especially the cinema chains will loose one of the most profitable movie series they had. And they did not even release this movie in 3-D as it was announced. Though it might be better that they didn't. Plus the movie would not have really been that much better with the effect. It is dark as it is (mood and lighting wise) and the 3-D would have made it even more so (which would have been a bad thing).The ending to this one, was carefully chosen and the movie was flowing at a nice speed. I never felt, like I was watching a very long picture. Now, where is the other movie, to see where it is heading.",7,0,0,31 December 2010
The Hills Have Eyes," Tries hard
","Aja had a really wonderful scary film before he did this (although his previous project had one major flaw, at least that's what I think, but more on that subject on that films IMDb site later), so they gave him this project. A remake of a Wes Craven horror flick from the 70s, that is considered a classic. Sounds like he had to lose everything, but couldn't gain anything? So why did he do the remake then after all that? Because he tried to bring it to the new millennium and changed a few things. Some of the changes are good, others aren't. One of the changes is the back story of the ... let's call them bad guys, another the dynamic in the family (main characters). All in all good things, but if you have seen the original, you can't shake the feeling off, that something is missing or that this isn't original enough (that's how I felt), plus there are characters (the guy at the gas station), who just didn't make sense at all ... Anyway, not bad but neither a classic!",6,0,1,24 April 2007
Kung Fu Panda 2," Great fun
","The Panda returns! And it is a great movie. I really enjoyed the movie. Almost a bit more than the first Panda movie. Jack Black and all the other voice cast are just 'awesome'. The story flows right, the jokes are there, everything fits neatly into place. While Pixar has not to be too afraid yet, another animation studios have proved they can put out great animated movies too.While the Panda probably won't get an 'animated' Oscar (and I'm sure it won't go to Pixar either, no offense against Cars 2), this shouldn't be the way this movie is judged. Fun for young and old, this is a great movie with some neat (3D) visual effects!",8,0,1,8 January 2012
American Psycho," Behind the Mask
","While I haven't read the book and it clearly is playing in another era, than it was filmed, this still has quite something to say about our society. While I'm pretty sure this was also in the book, the really weak follow-up to this, showed us that even with a great source material, you don't have a guarantee that the movie will be great. In this case and with Christian Bale on great form (maybe only his part in the Mechanists overshadows this performance to date, end of 2010), with a very quirky and darkly funny script.While everyone is talking about the ending, this is exactly what the filmmaker wanted us to do. And I love it, because it adds another layer/level to the whole movie. Which is just great. And in case you haven't read the book either, this is not for the faint hearted. Be advised that this does deliberately offend and provoke. You may not like what you see. Actually it would be a big surprise if you really liked the characters at all. But that's the point. Which could also work as a downfall for the movie. But it is handled with great care by the director.",9,1,2,13 September 2010
Little Miss Sunshine," Ain't no sunshine ...
","Well I have to admit I never understood nor do I think I will understand the need for very young girls to be displayed and taking part in such competitions like the mentioned 'Little Miss Sunshine'. Our main kid here is quite excited about that competition and she is so good in this movie. You may have seen her as adult or grown up before you watch this, but I reckon it was obvious from this one, she had acting talent.But she is also surrounded by quite the ensemble of actors. The script is also really good - and the extras on the disc make clear that also some nice ad lips add to the overall excitement. There are so many things that have to work, for a movie like this to be in the right lane - no pun intended. It's such a tightrope thing that you have multiple endings that were shot. But the one they ultimately used is the best one (imho).If you like dramas that feel and are real to life (with annoying behaviour, with characters that have to develop and have to overcome certain flaws) ... this is one of the movies you have to watch! No matter what you think of kids beauty peagants.",10,0,0,14 June 2020
North by Northwest," Way to go
","When is a spy a spy? And is the audience going to be able to tell if he is or isn't before it is revealed? And when will it be revealed? All those things make room for suspense, edge of your seat stuff. Cary Grant plays it as suave as one can play it - and the dry humor is just spot on (call the police anyone?). So the backdrops are obvious as with most of his movies, but that shouldn't bother you at all. We are talking about other things that will and should interest you way more than that little 'flaw'.The movie may feel a tad bit too long for some, but there is always something going on. And the way he edited some scenes is holding up quite nicely - something that not all movies that have action or stunt scenes can attest from that time period. And then there is that plane scene ... it is a bit of plot hole how we get there (or rather a character inconsistency, maybe even aplliable to at least 2 characters considering what they themselves are saying or doing) ... but normally you will not mind or care. This is light and fun and very identifiable",9,0,0,8 May 2020
Knowing," Next
","Nicolas Cage made a movie prior to that (a couple of years before this movie actually) called 'Next'. My first thoughts were, that Knowing sounded to much like that movie. But it's nothing like that, it is more connected to the 'Day the Earth Stood still' Remake. But quite better than that. Alex Proyas is on the helm, which promised me a good movie ...Nicolas Cage just deliver 100%, the movie has it's holes and bumps, it just doesn't move along smoothly. It's a shame, because the premise of the movie is great. I liked it and I really liked the ending. I still can't give the movie a better rating. It's good, but it has so many flaws, that I can see that quite a few people didn't like it at all.",6,0,1,11 August 2009
Coriolanus," Tough
","And it is tough, not because it brutal and/or violent (it is that too). But because it uses Shakespearean English in modern times. While it has been done before, it is definitely not something for everyone. It won't appeal to people who are looking for a quick snack. A movie they can just pop in (their player), watch and get out of the player/local cinema, after watching it.You really have to follow what people are saying. This of course means, while it does appall some, it also appeals to others. Myself I wouldn't count me in either of those leagues. I did find the premise interesting and I though Fiennes did a fine job directing (it looks really good). I still didn't feel a great impact. The actors were phenomenal too btw.Modern Shakespeare war ... is that your cup of tea?",7,39,76,27 September 2011
Hugo," Stunning
","Story-wise this might not be as flawless as some had hoped for (difficult to tell sometimes), but the cinematography, the love and care with which Scorsese handled a 'kids' film (from the man that brought you movies aimed at an adult crowd that is saying something) is just astonishing. Very careful framing, great effects and Scorsese (known) love for cinema shines through in every frame of it.Even just watching the trailer (which I had the pleasure of doing a couple of times recently again), before or after you watch the movie gives you just a good feeling overall. The boy has been cast good, Chloe shows she can be in serious and mellow roles too. Sascha Baron Cohens story might be a bit of a stretch for some, though I think they enjoy his comic relief moments as much as everyone else did.",8,2,4,11 May 2012
The Shining," King Shining
","I have not yet watched the TV version of the Shining. You know the one Stephen King actually likes and prefers to Kubricks version of his novel. But I cannot imagine it being better than this one. And while I have not read the book King wrote (and therefor cannot tell you the differences of how you should feel about King not liking it), I do like this movie very much.Saying there is attention to detail would be one major understatement. There is a documentary who interprets all the details of the film and goes quite far out at times, but more on that elsewhere. The movie at hand has powerhouse performances. Watching some behind the scenes footage, gives you quite the feeling of what went on.Some may have had issues with the way Kubrick went on to do things, the amount of takes he demanded, the way he behaved allegedly and much more. But the results on the screen speak for themselves. You may not like horror movies and yet still find something here. You also may like horror movies and think this isn't a horror movie at all. It's not easy, but he knows what he's doing and he plays the viewer like a fidel - relax and let it happen",10,2,2,23 November 2019
Wanted," Watch
","The guy who borough you 'Nightwatch' and 'Daywatch' has another Blockbuster for you. Unlike the other two movies, this one is shot entirely in English. For his first English movie, he chose this project, which is a free adaptation from the Wanted comic ... I haven't read that, so I don't know how 'free' the adaptation is.While the better known names are Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, the main actor is James McAvoy. And he's doing a great job. He's holding the movie more than together. Without his more than stellar/convincing performance the movie might have been less enjoyable. There almost too many clichés build into the story and some turns/twists are pretty foreseeable.Apart from the acting, the movie is very visual. But if you have seen the previous movies from the Russian director you might have guessed that. Great effects and (sound) editing. A 'popcorn' movie that deserves that praise",8,0,3,12 April 2009
Warrior," Fighting
","A movie called Warrior, well you know where this is heading. Even if there is also a philosophical side to the title (a more spiritual one so to speak). Tom Hardy got a lot of recognition for this, but Nick Nolte and our other main character are as good in this. We have two people who will engage each other, having a common issue. It's not a spoiler to write it, you'll find out soon enough (or guess it), but I'll let you do that for yourself.We established this is very nicely acted, but it's the story that matters. The past that is still haunting the present and holds some people down, so they're not able to continue to explore the 'future'. Shackles can be metaphorical too. And in this case it seems almost impossible to get rid of them. A drama that also has some fine action scenes in it ... More than worth a look",9,1,2,5 August 2014
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Good continuation
","The movie picks up, directly after the first one ended. Which is a pretty good thing. Story-wise we get character related sub-plots, so that everyone has something to do in the movie. The penguins get to play a bigger role (not a surprise, after their show-stealing performance in the first Madagascar picture) and have most of the funniest lines.For some it might feel a bit too much story/plot and I guess at least the really young kids, might not get everything, but they still will be entertained though. And while the movie is entertaining, compared to almost any Pixar movie, this seems like a fast food (snack). Not bad at all, but really great either.",6,0,2,6 May 2009
Salt," Guilty as charged(?)
","At least with pleasure. Guilty pleasure that is. If you into this expecting class as in 'The Fugitive' than you are in for a big disappointment. This is nowhere near that movie. And it is only closely related of course. While 'Salt' was supposed to be played by a male, I am happy that A. Jolie got that role and made it her own. It still does not diffuse from the fact, that the script is weak at best! But what is not weak, is the action choreography. It is shot very nicely. So if you are looking for a movie to pass the time, with enough tension and suspense, with a great lead actress, you could do worse than choose this movie. But if you are looking for depth of character than rent the Harrison Ford movie. The character bits here feel strangely forced and almost feel like annoying bits between the action. Maybe a little Pepper would have helped ...",6,0,2,28 December 2010

But even in the cinemas, there were some very funny bits after the credits rolled (stay tuned for a ... tune, that will make you smile and maybe even cry, like one of the main characters here did).The movie itself is really entertaining and funny, if you let yourself enjoy it. Some people didn't expect anything and were pleasantly surprised, some expected too much and were disappointed. But even the cinema version might is not kid friendly. One kid that is onto drugs has some of the funniest lines, just because they are so simple. You also have Nick Offerman, who always is good when improvising. Good comedy that might not always hit the spot, but has a great cast to support it all the way through",7,2,3,19 May 2014

But there were some things (especially some plot holes or coincidences), that were almost too much to bare! Now the actors were really good, especially Shia LaBeouf (whose like about in every movie, in other words, the currently big hot star, even playing in the new Indiana Jones movie, part 4 that is). But there also some very unfunny and stupid things the actors/characters have to do and some of them are not convincing (especially a cruel 'joke' near the end of the movie, when you watch the movie, you'll know what I mean, is so bad, that it physically hurts to watch it).

Silver Linings Playbook," De Niro is back
","While the big headlines might be taken by the Oscar nominated lead actors (and also Oscar winner, regarding Jennifer Lawrence), the other good news is that De Niro finally had a role he could relish in again. And a role we as viewers would actually like to see him in too. There have been a few lesser roles he played over the past couple of years. And while he is never able to completely disappoint, you won't remember him for a movie called 'Freelancers' and others in that vain.But back to the leading couple. A couple that is really so far apart, that you know what that ultimately means for them. But Bradley Coopers character has a lot more going on than that. There are relationships that went wrong and it's really tough sometimes to watch him destroying himself or at least attempting to. A very good movie, with great dialog",8,4,7,13 August 2013
Divergent," Target
","Are you the target audience? Are you female, possibly still a teenager? If you answer yes to both questions and will most likely also have read the book (I haven't), than the answer to what you think of this, is likely to be different from mine. Still I watched this with a female friend of mine and she was much ruder than me, when it came to evaluate the movie.It is a different take on the Hunger Games I reckon, though I have no idea what the time-line is on those books. The whole idea about classes and deciding your own fate is the backbone and the one thing that sort of works here. What does not work is the 'love story', again reducing teenage girls into messes who want to be treated as bad as possible, to fall in love with that 'hard shell, soft heart' kinda person. It's like the more the guy pushes her off, the more she wants him.We also get the clichés we expect to see. I can recommend the 'Honest Trailer' to this, just search for it online and you'll find it amusing too, I'm sure. It's what it is, the target audience cannot wait for the sequel(s)",5,2,5,15 August 2014

","You have to suspend disbelief ... big time! Just the fact the movie relies on kids to save humanity is more than a stretch. Of course there is a bit more to the story than this, but all is fuddled with a story that is repeating itself too often. There is some payoff, but not enough to keep most people interested.It's also unclear what audience this is aiming at. Themes running through it are too mature for little kids, but the movie itself is too simple for adults. So is it teenagers? And are they really interested in something like this? The box office wasn't clear either. While the movie didn't really make any money, it did get back what the movie cost (US and overall box office that is).

I was one of two people who didn't see 'White Ribbon' winning the Oscar for best foreign picture (though I wasn't right with my choice either and am still a little bit surprised about their bold choice). Not because I didn't like the movie. I think it is done in a great manner. The framing, the music, the cinematography, the (minimalistic) acting and the (downbeat) mood of the movie! It is easy to smash the movie, because there is not much happening. It does not offer any easy answers either. You might call it pretentious. As with every movie, there are people who'll love it to death and people who'll think it is just a waste of time. If you want easy though, you shouldn't be looking at a Haneke picture.

","As the user/reviewer 'Dick Steel' wrote here too, technically this movie seems perfect. The voice cast is great, the animation looks great and I'm sure the 3-D version looks awesome too (I could only watch the 2-D version).Unfortunately all the (best) jokes get revealed in the trailer and B.O.B. has nothing (much) more to say in the movie itself. He almost becomes annoying. The story is too thin, most jokes aren't working (or are revealed in the trailer as mentioned above) and you get the feeling that this was rushed into production. There must have been so many other things/directions the movie could've have gone, but unfortunately we will never know ... well maybe we will, because I'm sure despite the fact, that the movie wasn't successful, commercially and critically, there might be a sequel ... I can only hope they get it right then!",5,0,0,12 August 2009

Too cute, no emotional depth, but that's a different story altogether. But reminds us how difficult it is, to make a music/dance movie, that actually has some story to it.Most of the movies, just lay their weight on the dance scenes. And while those are fun to watch, you can't but think that you are watching a pretty long (and therefor boring) music video. The drama and the acting do elevate this one above some other efforts, but it's still not perfect. Well to me it isn't, so if you like this type of movies, you might enjoy it even more than I did.",6,1,4,21 July 2009
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Hunting Season
","I have to admit, that the movie never felt like it was dragging. The running time seems to be perfect, though I only have watched the theatrical version up to this point. I was a bit surprised that we got a bit of nudity in the movie, because Hollywood Blockbusters tend to avoid that sort of thing. Don't get too excited though (unless the extended cut offers more of that, that is).But the movie does live off the performances. Not only the lead characters, but also the supporting cast. A twist towards the end of the movie is predictable, but still fun to watch. It's sort of roller-coaster ride. Short and fast, some will like it and some will hate it, because they might feel sick afterwords (good effects).",7,2,4,17 August 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Connections
","One of the biggest things with this remake, was if Mara could play this role made iconic by Noomi Rapace. You'll have to answer that one for yourself, if you're even willing to watch both versions. If you ask me, it was tough watching Mara at first, because she went in a completely different direction with it, than Noomi did. But as the movie progressed, I started digging what she was doing with the character. It still would be tough to name a 'winner', I'd say I like both women and both characters they showed on screen.Overall and after watching the original Swedish movie again, in the longer TV cut this time, I have to admit, I think Fincher improved on the Swedish film. Of course you can always try to argue with his choices (like why not change location, why let the main actors talk English most of the time and other things), but that wouldn't be a good way to spend your time. It's better to watch it and enjoy his version of the movie (though 'enjoy' might stretch it at times, because the movie does not pull any punches!).Having said that, I'm curious why there is no connection to the original movie showing up here on IMDb. Is it that obvious that no one thought of putting it in the details? I'm not sure what happened there, though I'm sure someone will change it (it's almost April 2012, let's see how long it'll take).Comparing the two adaptations of the novel (which I haven't read), I can tell you that there are differences. Smaller ones (plot points and other things), but also time framing and character points. I can only recommend this, because it is a great thriller indeed!",9,6,11,29 March 2012
Step Up 2: The Streets," Fitting
","That poster and that title: Fitting is actually fitting in this case. Step up 2 the Streets works, especially if you liked the first one and are not a cynic about what this all meant cinema wise (including a very lame spoof called Dance Flick). But what this is most notable for is the introduction of Moose (character). Someone you'd think was there from the beginning and is a big part of the Step up franchise, just got into part 2, but since then is an integral part of it all.The story is as predictable as the others are, but with new leads in the male and female department and other song and dance routines you do get something fresh out of it. It really does work on a couple of levels throughout.",6,0,0,30 April 2016
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Carrell and his gang
","This movie is really funny and although it runs long (even longer on the extended cut on DVD, which I haven't watched), it is funny and with the exception of a few little 'bumps' in the story or drama, it works fine! Steve Carrell is very funny and believable. And he also shows us, that he can carry a movie as a lead. Of course his partners in crime are very well casted, too.Some jokes are a bit childish, but they're played with so much gusto, from the cast, that you don't really mind. There's a particular scene, involving Carrell's character and his back. You could call it a 'torture' scene, if you like! ;o) If you watch the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. Recommended",7,2,3,9 July 2007
Face_Off," Game on with Face/Off
","I'm a big Woo Fan, so I'm not entirely objective here. So if you're not such a big Woo Fan as I am, you might object with my rating and think that I rated movie 1 or 2 stars too high.The Face/Off story isn't new, but it is told with great bravura from John Woo. The actors are good too, although I think that Travolta might be the only weak link ... and still he's strong enough. No match for N. Cage, mind you.If you've seen some Woo movies, you'll be familiar with his style. Pigeons, Slow Motion and so forth. Violence never looks so stylistic and theatrical ... it's a Woo blueprint! Of course there's more, but I won't spoil that for you ... watch the movie for yourself to see the drama ...",9,1,2,2 April 2007
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Quirky but strange
","If that summary line makes any sense that is. While I got a feel for the quirkiness of the movie through the trailer, I have to admit, that I thought it would've been even quirkier. Even as it is, it's a very good movie, with exceptional comedic performances by all involved. It just doesn't seem to be able to stay in the same mood throughout. Which quite frankly is a shame.Having said that and while the movie title is a big attraction to the film (as are the Stars involved), there is still quite a few great moments to be had here. Even if the movie seems to come to a full stop here and there, I can recommend it, if you like your movies quirky and not really that predictable.",7,1,4,9 September 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Another Mission that's impossible
","It's really a feat to make that many movies/entries into a series (especially one that builds on a TV show) and keep the quality on a higher standard. There are things that are cliché and things seem to repeat themselves (watch the Honest trailer made for this series by 'screenjunkies'), but it still works. It might be the enthusiasm Tom Cruise brings to the table and therefor the talent he hires to keep this on a top level.The action scenes always were good, that doesn't change with this. You get some familiar faces from previous entries, though also new people (female lead to name one). The mixture is good, and even though we know Cruises character is good, we have to endure others who don't quite get it at first ... which makes for some interesting if predictable turns during the movie",7,1,4,19 October 2015
Spider-Man," Best one yet
","I know that many regard Spider Man 2 as the best Spider Man movie to date (part 4 and 5 are on it's way, but not here yet). For me personally, Spider man does the job. It's a fun (even quite a few times dark) intro into the world of Spider Man. Tobey Maguire seems so perfect in his role, it would be a shame, if someone would replace him for future installments (even though in part 3, he seemed like a mess, I do think it was the script that let him down on that one).Of course we are talking Spider Man here and not Batman, so the Origin story is lighter and more teen/kids friendly. But having Sam Raimi at the helm of the movie, it still crosses some small boundaries. The story, the character arc, the beginning, the villain ... everything fits together. It's simple, it's fun ... and it even has Bruce Campbell in it! ;o)",8,0,1,21 July 2009
Shrek Forever After," Wish-fulfillment
","After the very disappointing 3rd Shrek it only could get better now couldn't it? Maybe there was a slight chance it would continue downhill, but fortunately they actually did manage to come up with a good story. A story one can only hope that puts the Shrek Saga to rest. What else should there come after this? It's OK to do a spin-off with Antonio Banderas character, but please not another Shrek (because I very much fear it would be along the lines of the very bad Shrek 3).So while they didn't invent anything new (or did they?), the basic idea to make it about Shrek finding himself was strong enough to fill the movie. Not that many subplots and almost no distraction help the movie significantly! Not Pixar territory, but a good movie nevertheless.",7,0,0,23 October 2010
Dark City," DC as Directors Cut
","Also Darc City of course - but when I rewatched this the other day, I did watch the Directors cut and I only can recommend this highly. This may still (even though it apparently has won a lot of wins and nominations) be underrated - which is quite the shame.This is dark and innovative. It has great actors in it and it also really resonates on many levels. And while it is not comparable to the Matrix, I wouldn't blame people if they see some similarities at least. Just take the central character: would you be surprised if he was named Neo? He is sort of a chosen one. Having said that, this has a different story or a more contained scenario. Still quite complex and still very nicely structured (if you excuse the pun).The movie or the making of it, had quite a few hurdles to overcome. But we finally get to see what the director intended us to see. Or at least a close version of it. If you like Science Fiction, there is almost no excuse for you not to watch it. Unless it is happy go lucky Sci-Fi you are into. Nothing wrong with that, but not what you get served here",10,0,0,24 May 2020
Dunkirk," Bravery in the making
","I guess when it comes to Nolan or anyone we really appreciate, we may have a different standard we hold them accountable to. So maybe I am being a bit unfair, while I was trying to figure out if I'd give it a 9 or an 8, deciding to go with an 8 in the end. Minor details I know, but I want to get into, why I only gave it an 8.Let's take the positive: Try to watch it as big as possible (no size matters jokes here please, still this was shot to be seen as huge as possible)! The framing, the quality of the pictures is amazing to say the least. And even critics of Nolans work admit that he know how to frame his movies. Furthermore the audio and sound design in general is on a top level. No doubt it will be nominated for the Academy Award. I actually right now would even say is a strong contender for winning at least one of the sound 'awards'.So technically speaking this is on a top level. It also has a story that will leave many in disbelief, but this really happened (haven't looked at details, but I reckon we just watch the overall picture - no pun intended). Now why not a higher rating? The fact that it defies certain narratives and goes a bit of a different route is nice to see. What it does have is a repetition in scenes. Which kind of defies certain highlights ... and is sort of a shame ... so maybe I am too harsh on it and maybe I should applaud it for not being too personal about certain things, even though we have tent-pols of certain characters, that we get back to amidst all the chaos ... a very well choreographed and shot chaos that is ...",8,0,6,4 September 2017
The Machinist," Working
","If I were to rate the performances in the movie, I would have rated it much higher. And that's not only because of the physical change and dedication Christian Bale put into it. No he really got into the role as good as he could. The bit players being very well cast too. But the movie did let me down, because it was too obvious were it was leading (at least to me it was).If that does not matter to you, than it means you will enjoy it more (and the reviews and ratings prove, that more people do that) than me. Don't get me wrong, I think it's a very good movie, I just don't feel it too be that good overall, just because it was too obvious. Maybe that's something you won't agree on with me, but that's how I felt, when I watched it",6,2,3,5 October 2010
The Intouchables," Best friends
","A comedy like that is tough to master. Balancing the funny and the dramatic stuff and still keep enough character development inside. And while I wouldn't say that both characters really redeem themselves (wholly), it gives them nice touches. Touches that include quite a lot of non-PC behavior (be alert and do not watch, if you are sensible to that sort of thing).It is a french comedy with heart. And it was a sleeper hit in Germany. Word of mouth made this a big success. A bit of credit has to go to the people who dubbed it I guess (I watched the original version with subtitles), because they must have done a phenomenal job. It is not perfect, but that fact makes it even weirder and more adorable",9,9,15,3 April 2012
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Gary Oldman
","I don't know why I pointed him out, but I liked his character here. If you've seen the movie or know the books (I personally haven't done the latter), than you know his serious ... excuse me Sirius Black character is very detailed and fun to play (for him) and to watch (for us the viewers).Talking about watching, if you are about to watch this, I can safely assume that have seen or read the previous installments of the franchise, so you know quite a bit about Potter. And you will notice here, that the overall tone just got darker. Which is a good thing! Still family friendly enough though, while Potter remains a 'kid' magician that has to face another challenge (almost) day by day ...",7,0,1,10 October 2007
Ratatouille," Smells like ...
","... another Pixar hit. And it tastes and looks like one too! Concerning the latter: We're used that Pixar movies look good (other animation studios can keep up with the looks), but it's the story, the characters and maybe a magic ingredient, that differentiates Pixar from other studios ...So maybe Cars wasn't really Pixars best movie (it really wasn't, although if that's the baddest they get, than they don't have to worry at all!), but they made up for that with this movie. While the low expectations (mine) for a movie involving a car were met, some people might have been more than surprised, that the 'rat'-story did work out! I can only recommend this very highly (doesn't matter if you're young or old, or even in-between), all you have to do is watch it ... unless you have a fear of rats and/or animated movies of course!",9,1,3,27 January 2008
Bad Teacher," Bad Apple
","There is a certain energy in that movie. Especially at the beginning when Cameron Diaz seems invincible she has the time of her life (almost literally). There is a great sequence where she kinda falls down though which sets of the rest of the movie. Unfortunately even though it does make sense for her character, it does loose quite a bit of its pace from that point on.Justin Timberlake is good in playing kind of against character and does not care about what people may think. Jason Segel is almost underused in this one and even Cameron Diaz did not really have that many great moments overall. And for a movie that tries to stay raunchy, it does even fail at combining that with the funny elements. While deliciously evil at times (and good), it also misses the point half of the time. Not really bad, but not that good either (I only watched the cinema release and not the extended cut)",5,18,32,5 March 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Low expectations
","Most people might have overrated this movie, just because they went in expecting this to be one of the worst Blockbusters made (in recent years). Fortunately that is not the case. Just the fact they cast Martin Sheen and Sally Fields as a couple was one great coup. Great chemistry there. All the actors work in this one actually, but those two bring some weight/gravitas to the whole movie.Of course the movie does have its weaknesses, such as logic or other things the screenwriter couldn't be bothered with. But that doesn't and shouldn't be an obstacle you can't overcome. Because otherwise you wouldn't be able to enjoy the movie as the majority did (as is evident by the voting on here).Of course it is a bit weird seeing a similar origin story again after only 10 years (most will still have the Raimi movie fresh in mind). But it does work, which did surprise me too.",7,2,4,7 September 2012
The Lego Movie," Let go
","The voice talent (read acting talent) that is here, is amazing. The movie itself is very creative to say the least, something you might have done when you were a kid too. Going places letting your mind fly, not setting up barriers. At least that's how it feels to me. And the movie makes a point of it.While the movie is going on there is one big twist that will either shock you entirely (like myself) or you have read about it and it won't be as shocking as it could be. It doesn't make the movie less good. Try to watch it as open minded as you can and enjoy the jokes (some taken from movies) and feel your inner kid enjoying himself again ... no matter your age",9,1,3,18 August 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Real
","The character Matthew McConaughey portrays is not a saint. He did some very good things, that helped a lot of people, but his intention was not to be heroic from the get go. And the film does portray him as a man with faults and flaws all the same. It's that fact that really elevates the movie above other rose tinted movies that show everything to be smooth, soft and nicely done.This one gets down and dirty (sometimes literally) and will not be everyones taste. Even though or because the Academy Awards did think this was worthy of some statues. You may argue that there must have been a better performance in 2013 than that of Jared Leto. But you can't criticize him or think less of the movie, if some other people made that decision. Plus he is good in this movie, whether you like the character he plays or not.Not an easy movie to watch, this will keep you on your toes if you allow it to.",8,2,2,5 August 2014
The Fast and the Furious," Diesel Show
","While Paul Walker is the Protagonist (main role) in this movie, Vin Diesel steals the show. Apart from the car stunts that is. Because if you don't have good stunts, than the movie doesn't work at all. The story as it is, is pretty cliché, but it's nice fun and it's also watchable.Especially because as mentioned, because of a mesmerizing (for this genre) performance from Vin Diesel. A few flops later and nobody remembered why he was called the new Action Hero, but watching this (and of course the superb 'Pitch Black') might remind you why you liked him in the first place (or could be a reason to discover him for a younger audience). Cars, women, insane stunts, solid/decent acting (for this genre) and nice characters ... what more could you ask for, from a movie like this? Not much more I think :o)",6,0,2,11 August 2009
Goon," Not your typical Sports movie
","A lot of swearing, nudity and beatings make this a really different breed of Sports movie altogether. So don't compare this to other ice hockey movies that have been done in the past, because it won't hold up against those, just because they were more sweet natured. This one is really a punch in the face, while it consistently insults you. Can you deal with that? Than you can watch it too.Sean William Scotts introduction into the movie worried me a little (the opening montage made him look like another Stiffler character). But you can dismiss that thought right away, because he is almost the complete opposite (even if it sometimes feels like he could swing around and do something 'Stiffler-ific'). Jay B. who also co-wrote the movie, is on best friend duty here and may either annoy you to death or amuse you to death. Hopefully the latter. Because in the end: There will be blood ...",7,1,1,16 July 2012
Now You See Me," Can you see me now?
","I do like to know as little as possible about a movie before I go ahead and watch it. Movies like this one almost make no sense watching if people tell you more than a few pillars/plot points of it. It's about magicians, but also about crime. It's also a thriller, but also very funny almost like a comedy.Intentions may not be clear, but they will be by the end of the movie. And while some things seem to convenient (like a relationship that seems to build too fast), the movie does work and warrants more than another viewing. It's been a while since a movie was as mysterious yet so intriguing and rewarding as this is. Prestige by Nolan comes to mind (which is slightly better, so if you haven't seen that one, go check it out, though not as funny and light as 'Now you see me' is)! Great entertainment, great actors and a stunning finale",9,0,4,6 September 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Smart, but also 'cheating'
","And when I say cheating I'm not only talking about moments where things are not logical anymore (logical in the realm of what we get served that is, not logical as in the 'real' world), but also story-wise. If you watch it through, you'll know what I mean. On the other hand it's nice to put a lid on some things ... or quite a couple of things. Or closing a circle ... or whatever you want to call it.So whatever your take on that is (head shaking or nod of approval), will decide how you'll receive this movie. Technically there is nothing to criticize and the story (if not depicted and torn apart for logical errors), is more than entertaining enough to hold you to the edge of your seat. If you've seen the other movies, you'll love how this comes together, even if your favorite character might not get as much screen time as you thought/hoped he/she would get. Great moments and superhero movies have arrived a long time ago. And they'll continue, one way or the other. Rejoice or be afraid ;o)",8,2,5,20 September 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Civil War: What is good for
","For some apparently the answer is absolutely nothing. But if you bought into the Marvel Universe thing, then you know how they roll. It doesn't mean the movies are all the same. Quite the opposite, as Dr. Strange showed us. But even here you get political statements. And if it didn't do that the movie probably would have been seen as just another Comic Book movie that didn't take it's role model position to also have a message for the viewers.But do not despair, there is plenty of action in there. It's just that the movie does try to make you think about things and challenge you a bit. Also it does want to show that there are consequences to actions taken. Whether you agree with that approach or not is up to you. And again, there is enough action and fun to be had. You can take anything apart if you really want to and make it look bad, but you would take away a lot of fun that you can have.",8,2,5,19 January 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A long time ago ...
","Or is it a long time has passed? As you probably know already without me having to point it out, this is based on a book by the Harry Potter writer (even in the movie there are references). I haven't read the books (I know shame on me), so I can't compare anything from Potter books or this in specific.What I can tell you though, is that this has great special effects. And a really neat story to carry too. Is it predictable? Yes of course it is, painting peoples characters pretty easily. But while people claim this to be more of an adult version of Harry Potter (and there is some light violence and death), this still can be called a kids movie. It's an adventure for everyone sort of. You can actually enjoy this without thinking too much. There is so much visual stuff in there, that your mind will be opened",7,0,0,16 April 2017
Saw III," Bloody affair
","If you thought the first two installments of the Saw franchise were bloody (and you seriously should watch them first, before you even think about watching this one), than ... think again! Or better yet, watch this one ... again and again! Because it's so bloody, that the German equivalent to the American MPAA (or some other state department, that I don't know the name of at this very moment) did put this one on an index list ... that means, that you can't put any advertisement of the movie in any magazine and that it can only be sold in separate shops/areas of shops, that can only be entered by adults! (and they didn't even allow the unrated cut in Germany, so I'm talking about the cinema/r-rated cut) But is the gore content guarantee for the quality of a movie? Of course not. The tension is there and the story good enough for a sequel (it firs into the rest of the storyline quite well, especially seen them as a whole)!",8,0,0,24 February 2008
Ocean's Eleven," What a cast
","But it's more than that! The story is great, the actors enjoy their roles. And so will you, if you watch the movie! The movie has many players, but still concentrates on one central one (George Clooney's) for your attention. But I was a little bit surprised that Don Cheadle is not listed in the credits (according to IMDb) ...It's style and funny dialogues from beginning to the end. Andy Garcia is a great villain here too. Someone you like to see fall down. But the question is, does he? You'll have to see the movie for that. Be excited, be very excited! Especially if you know the Original (with Frank Sinatra and others), because this movie is an example, that a remake can in fact not only be as good as the Original, but be even better! Watch it and you'll see! :o)",8,0,1,9 May 2007
The Conjuring 2," The real sequel
","After the mediocre (if you're being nice) Annabelle, which was a prequel, we do get the real treat. While there still will be an Annabelle 2 (? No seriously -> ?), a movie I probably could do without, this sequel is something that touches upon the themes of the original and with the same cast actually delivers on its promise.Apparently the filmmakers take real life incidents (things that actually happened to some degree) and build a movie around it. And it does work, because you do have a stellar pair who really have a great chemistry. It's not bloody horror, but it is horror that is able to have you at the edge of your seat",8,1,2,23 February 2017
Jackie," Simple yet effective
","Sometimes a film that is simple does not have to be bad or ineffective. In this case Natalie Portman is really giving it her all. Not sure how accurate the events are, but what we see is 'real' drama nonetheless. And while it may feel boring for some, it will excite others. Actually you should be able to know which group you belong to.Having said that, technically sound and as already said acting wise there's also no fault to see. This is not a masterpiece, but it is something that will leave a mark for some - one way or another",7,0,0,7 March 2020
No Strings Attached," Detachment
","Sometimes a bit of attachment isn't that bad. And while I love Natalie Portman and she tries her best with her role, too many stock characters seem to fill the movie. And while it might sound neat on paper the time lapse thing didn't exactly work in favor of the movie, the feeling of it at least.Ashton K. performance is in the eye of the beholder. You either like him or you loathe him. I wouldn't say he's bad, but there's nothing special in his performance here either. Kevin Kline seems to be wasted also (another one of those stock characters).Still you get light fun, romance and comedy mixed together. So not bad, but nothing special either.",5,0,2,26 November 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," It actually kicks *ss
","I think it's sad that the movie did not do great business at the American Box office. I didn't know that up til a few minutes ago, when I saw it here on IMDb. I would have thought that more people got in and watched it. It is a very weird movie, that does not seem to care about conventions, be it story-telling wise (think the ending) or montage-wise (think ... well montage, where Scott gets ready).But maybe that was too much and too daring. I can see that quite a few people wouldn't like what they saw, it is not what most people might expect from a comic book movie. Though the comic does not seem to be very ordinary either (haven't read it yet).The cast is incredible and the jokes are really good. It might feel a bit distant and not emotionally grabbing, but that is on purpose. Which still might make you hate/love it though of course (depending on your taste). I did feel the movie a bit dragging after the middle, where it seemed like a video game, where you had to do/see another scene that was like the one before. It felt a bit like that to me, though that does not necessarily apply to any other viewer of course.Give it a chance on Disc, if you haven't already watched it.",8,3,12,24 October 2010
Inside Out," Inside the head of Pixar
","This might be the closest we get, to see inside the heads of the creative minds of Pixar (pun intended). And how wonderful it is in there. The idea itself seems to great that you do wonder how no one has made something as beautiful as this up until now. But Pixar proves again, that even though the idea might be out there, it is able to make it work on so many levels with the layers attached.Giving feelings a face and make them react a certain way is amazing. Giving them a way to grow and learn as if they were humans just adds to that whole thing. There is so much going on here, that it would take too many words and space to go into detail of it all. But all that and the message is still packed in a movie that is also entertaining and funny. Something Pixar movies have succeeded in doing for quite some time now ...",9,19,42,11 September 2016
The Duchess," Queen Keira
","Although another movie with Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland, which was a period piece, was something I didn't like that much. Especially because I thought that the only saving grace of the movie was Donald S., with Keira not being up to the (acting) challenge. Well this movie proves me wrong (to myself).Keira is really great in this movie. She pulls off her role quite well. And it doesn't even matter who her screen-'partner' is, she is always on top of her game. The story is told quite nicely and even the bit players are great. If you are into period dramas, you will love this anyway, but even for people who haven't watched that many, are going to have an eventful watch. As an extra bonus (if you want to call it that), the movie is based on real events.",7,0,1,6 August 2010
Resident Evil," Evil Begins
","When I first watched this movie, I was still under the impression, that it could have been made by George Romero. Not a good state of mind to be watching any movie then (at least for me). If I had rated it back then, it would have been a worse rating I can assure you that. Especially because I had read a script (a first draft), of what Romero would have done with it.But as it is, the movie kicked off (literally) a series of movies. And when I re-watched it recently, I did so with the commentary on. And when you listen to the people talk about this movie passionately, you can't help but almost fall in love with it. I was tempted to give it a very high rating then. I think the middle way was good though. There are things that have been done good here (some of the action, the suspense stuff, the casting of Michelle Rodriguez) and others that haven't (the story, the rest of the action as Rodriguez does say so herself on the commentary and some other things).All in all a decent horror movie, but nothing to get too excited about.",5,0,0,30 December 2010
Avengers: Endgame," Time to play the (end)game
","I usually do not watch movies twice in such a short amount of time. But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.My summary is a pop culture reference and there are quite a few in the Marvel movies, hinting at other franchises (Alien got name checked for example in Infinity War and even 'copied' or 'homaged' if you will and there are a few in Endgame too). But those little digs are not too important, they are just nice touches for those who know them. Having an understanding of the MCU as a whole, from Phase 1 to now Phase 3 is way more important. And as someone who is not too familiar with the comics myself, I can tell you that knowing the movies is enough to enjoy the franchise.Still you can google the other stuff or even make your own conclusions. Now that is a lot of foreword and I haven't even gotten one word about Endgame. But as I said above, no spoilers here. What we do know (from the trailers) is the beginning. But whatever we saw and thought we knew - what happens not even half an hour into the movie, will rattle you. Now what?Yes the first hour of the movie is 'slow', but it had to be. There are ramifications after the snap and the characters we learned to love, that we have close to our heart, have been torn apart. Quite literally gone with the wind - everyone is thinking how is this going to be resolved (no pun intended)? And the movie will give you answers, and will even try to sort of explain things that are quite - unexplainable.And while there is full on drama, there is still a lot of humor. The movie takes beloved characters and does things to them - or rather the weight of what happened does things to them. What exactly? Well that would be telling, but let me tell you some very bold choices have been made. And if you are not emotional at least during some scenes, you are taking away a lot of fun for yourself.I can be a cynic too at times, but taking this apart (which you can do with every movie), is only hurting your own viewing pleasure. There is so much love in this, for the characters, for details, for the fans - it's just a rollercoaster and I'm not afraid to say that I shed a couple of tears. It is after all tying knots and bringing certain things to a conclusion.That doesn't mean there isn't anything more coming (because we know there is, next up Spiderman as an in between movie before Infinity War?). And there are some familiar faces coming back to Endgame from other movies that we haven't seen in a while but also new cameos like Ken Jeong. I'm guessing there will be a deleted scene with him, his scene seems to short for storytelling purposes I reckon.Epic fights, epic emotions and dialog that is hinting at things to come later in the movie ... which you will see even clearer with repeat viewing(s) ... The Russos did it - Kudos to them, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee (RIP) and everyone else involved in this of courseEdit: Endgame works even for people who have not seen a single MCU movie yet (confirmed by a friend of mine). But of course the gravitas and the conclusions of everything will work way better if you have seen the rest of the movies. Also let me add that this is 'technically sound' as some would put it - or just plain great visually speaking. But I reckon this is a given anyway.

Quantum of Solace," Come to terms
","After the 'Bond begins' movie with Daniel Craig (also known as Casino Royal), I came to terms into where Bond was moving to. And watching Jason Bon... ah sorry I mean James Bourne of course. No, but seriously, after many years, where Bond was the one that got copied, Bond now tries to stay in touch with the times and went 'air-bo(u)rne' (pun intended).You can hold it against this movie, as well as the fact, that Bond never get's to say his name on-screen ('Bond. James Bond'), but does that really matter? For some it does, but I think if you survived the Casino Royale deconstruction of Bond, than you should be prepared, what to expect here.I liked the raw-ness of Bond and I also liked the ending, which is so Anti-Bond, that it has an original flavour and adds to the whole thing. Of course there isn't much of a plot here ... it's a continuation to the Casino Royale story, or better it sort of concludes that. I did like the movie, because I got my head around one thing ... to rephrase a quote: 'Bond is dead, long live the (new) Bond!' I'm not that excited about the whole thing yet, but maybe after the third one, I will be! And a movie that get's that much attention and get's discussed and even taken apart by some, has to have something going for it.",8,6,13,19 April 2009
The Butterfly Effect," Run, Butterfly, Run
","I don't think it was conceived to spawn a series of movies. Especially if you consider the fact, the other movies were direct-to-DVD fodder. But here with the first one, we have a clear winner (I haven't actually watched the third part of the series yet). It's the story, it's the actors and everything else.And with everything else I'm also talking about the extras on Disc here. You have to watch the deleted scenes (if you liked the movie that is). It opens quite a few new view on things. You might not be a big fan of Mr. Demi Moore (aka Ashton Kutcher), but he's really good in this. Forget about his MTV show and if you didn't like the 70s show, forget about that too ... just because it has nothing to do with the movie and for the fact, that he is playing something completely different here.The movie was successful (why else the 'sequels'), but I do think it could have been even more successful. Watch and enjoy!",9,0,1,15 September 2010
District 9," Very well documented praise ...
","I haven't seen the short movie this is based on and which apparently impressed Peter Jackson enough to pull some weight, so that this first-time director (at least full length wise), could get a decent budget to realise his dream. Of course that also brings quite a few haters, who say this isn't a first time project if you get to play with that much money ...But a) you have to earn that and b) you have to know how to handle that money. And here is a young new talent that shows promise. The movie, that wasn't exactly how I imagined it, but managed to exceed my (high) expectations! It's more for adults though, not so much because of the violence level, but because of the social commentary that surrounds the whole story/movie.",9,1,5,4 November 2009
Mamma Mia!," Musi-can
","I'm not a big Musical fan myself. But I have to admit, this was kind of well made. One of the main things that works here, that didn't work in 'Walking on Sunshine' for example, is the acting. You have some pretty great actors in this and they make you forget about all the clichés that are in this.Even so, the clichés never reach the level the other mentioned movie had. But let's not talk about failures (even if the soundtrack of the other movie was great too, though not fitting half the time), but about this and the really nice location it has too. The light mood, the direction and the suave this has, elevate it to a level that even people who are not into musicals might enjoy ... those who like them will anyway",6,0,2,16 September 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The bigger/higher they are ...
","And I'm not only talking about Smaug here, although this being part 2 you can imagine there is a lot more to come (obviously). No I'm talking about Peter Jackson and the Tolkien universe in general. It's obvious that some people will get fatigue after a long series. Especially one that gets stretched even more than necessary. The movie itself is technical on a level that is really great. The acting is solid and the story holds its own.Still I won't tell anyone how to feel about this. Especially considering the fact that we get a teenage formula integrated into this. The very well known two male fighting over one girl thing that worked for Twilight, Hunger Games and other movies that came out recently. It's obviously to reel in a bigger female audience or at least to keep them interested, while the male audience is there from the get go (Fantasy, action, adventure, who could say no to that, with Special effects to enhance it all).So while it feels stretched and Jackson does take liberties (giving us new characters like the one played by Lilly or inserting ones that weren't there in the original book), you can still have a lot of fun watching it. You just have to find a ground to enjoy this for what it is ... a bridge to part 3 ...",7,2,3,18 June 2014
Toy Story 4," Afterlife
","So a fourth Toy Story movie? Even the teaser trailer made fun of this, because we all knew (got told), that there would be no more. Now what do we make of this? You could bury your head in the sand and act like a friend of mine, who in a way denies this movie exists and really presses that if it was called something else he might have liked it.Now if you can be a bigger person or just able to distinguish and get un-stuck (if you were in the first place that is): there is a really good movie here. Pixar almost always gets it right and you kind of know they would not mess with this or rather just do something for the sake of it. So while the third put a really good lid on it (full circle, great ending, whatever you want to say about it), this finds a way to give us a new story ... and a new satisfying (?) ending ... that depends on the viewer of course.Great animation, great voice work, good new and old new characters, although there is an emphasis on some of them and your fave may not get as much screentime as you'd like. Still all good - no pun intended.",9,1,3,25 September 2019
Batman Begins," Darker rebirth
","It seemed the past few years many things began ... again. Yes Superman returned, but it was a beginning too. Batman begins is one of the best efforts of this latest craze that emerged. And the director is playing a key part in this.Christopher Nolan is of course not the only man to 'blame' on the success of this reinvention and of course re-birth of Batman (after part 3 and 4 you could be excused, if you thought it was over for Batman)! Where the new Bond (21st installment) was about to throw away the complete history of Bond as you knew it, Batman 'just' reinvented the style of the two first movies. Yes I liked the first two Batmans, but I do also think that Nolan's Batman is better. Beginning by the costume (completely dark, instead of having something yellow on his chest, that would be like an easy target to shoot at) and goes on, with the man behind the mask. Beautifully played by Bale, who is supported by a great cast! A great drama with action in it ... what do you want more?",8,2,3,23 May 2007
The Fault in Our Stars," TV drama of the week
","Don't get me wrong, I did notice that there are a lot of people who 'enjoyed' this and declared this as their favorite movie of 2014 (or at least the month they watched this). Unfortunately I couldn't see it that way, which has to do with the fact, that this is so by the numbers that it hardly evoked an emotional reaction (once at the airport scene with the father, but several times it was shuddering, because of the sugar overload this has).I actually was under the impression it was another Nicholas Sparks film/novel this was based on. Not because I read this anywhere, but of how the 'story' 'developed'. No real surprises here, not even that you get beautiful people looking beautiful, while pretending to be something else (or sick). That wouldn't matter though, because even movie sickness is best portrayed by someone we love to watch, but the fact it lies to itself ('you are a fairy tale/movie' is what someone should tell the voice over, if it actually helped ... but it won't).A far better movie on the subject, which actually does evoke emotion if you get on the ride is '50/50'. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Anna Kendrick are killing it (sorry for the pun). Still this movie has a fan base which will hate my guts for writing all those things, but I would be lying if I wrote anything else. Perception is everything",5,8,14,24 September 2014
Twilight," OC meets Buffy
","This phenomenon that calls itself Twilight hit me completely unexpected. So unexpected, that when I actually saw the movie, I wasn't entirely sure, if the source novel/book, was written many years ago or not that long ago ... The latter was true which just confirmed my first thought after watching it. And my thought was my summary line. That could have been the pitch ... or should have been! While I don't see entirely the attraction on Robert Pattinson (and/or his character), he is quite different, than ... let's say other characters. It's amazing what you will read about the movie, which can spoil quite a bit. There is another major character here, who only plays a small role in this one. But if you watch the movie, you know pretty much, what this character is going to evolve to (literally) in the future installments of the series.While the adults bring some nice flavor to the whole thing, you could wonder why there are only beautiful people on screen. But that wouldn't do this movie justice. It is targeted at teen girls (well girls/women in general) and fully achieves it's goal(s). So while some men will be bitter about this movie (experience), their (girl-)friends will love it. I know because I watched it with my niece(on DVD). And she went out and bought the books! Mission accomplished",6,0,2,23 March 2010
Climax," Influenced by ...
","This is not an easy watch. And while Climax may suggest this to be very sexual or at least sensual, you might be dissapointed if you're looking for that kind of 'satisfaction'. The choreography of the dancing is really good, the cinematography is something to behold too. If you don't mind long uninterrupted shots that is of course.This is about addiction, about people driven to go the extra mile and about people hoarded in a secluded location going 'nuts' as some might describe it. And as a different reviewer wrote: this is an experience. It will split a lot of people as it did at the various festivals it played. This is not an ordinary movie, but when has Noe done that? So if you are aware of his body of work, you at least know not to expect something 'normal'. Now some have stated, that if you had experience with certain drugs, you may understand or 'enjoy' this experience more than others. I can't talk to that, not having had that experience. I can say though that this is quite rough to watch. Especially when things spiral downwards ...Still very enticing and tension filled. Technically almost flawless it will depend what you make of the 'story' or rather the excuse of one to get the viewer to go on a ... well 'trip'!",8,0,2,12 February 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," Not a wreck at all
","Great movie with a great voice performance by John C. Reilly. Also a different kind of role (even if animated) for the otherwise very naughty Silverman. But apart from those voices, the animated movie you get here is a treat. The idea itself is more than funny and there is even a morality here. The good thing is, that you don't get the message hammered into you violently.It's more subtle than that. The animation is good apart from the sections that depict the 'game' within the movie of course. But that is something that has to be that way. Kids watching this will never know what bad graphic was, because they never had to experience that. Good/bad for them is what you could say. But even they won't hold it against this movie, especially because those sections are not that long.Great comedy and good family entertainment movie.",8,0,0,9 June 2013
To Rome With Love," To the fans with love
","Woody Allen is not everyones taste. Just the fact he is in most/some of his own movies, might be a turn off for most. But this one is a series of different stories all grounded in Rome. A decade ago no one would've guessed that Mr. Allen would ever do a movie outside of New York. And here he is touring Europe now! Maybe Rome will become his new muse (no pun intended) after London.The fact that we have so many stories with so many different characters also means, that we get different quality in those stories. So you may like one storyline more than the other. The one involving Woody Allen wasn't my favorite, because it was too obvious what he was trying to make there. My personal favorite is the one with Alec Baldwin. It's a tricky one, if you want it to be. And very well written too!",8,1,3,3 January 2013
Bridesmaids," Not everyones Bride(smaids)
","This movie does divide people. It is very foul mouthed and it does not care if you like the language or the way the characters act in it. I do respect if people feel offended by it. Unfortunately that will cloud their view of the underlying themes in this. Just because it is crass and vulgar, it doesn't mean it's pointless.Quite the opposite is the case. You have strong themes of friendship, envy and growing older to bare (well our characters have to bare those things). Not to mention the whole wedding thing, that is quite a big deal for every woman. I didn't enjoy every joke, but I liked the way women handled themselves in this. Our main character has an arch and you can clearly see her progress through the whole film (and all the jokes).Again, if you are easily offended this is not for you. Don't expect it to be a female Hangover either. And then you might enjoy it too :o)",8,0,2,13 January 2012
Meet the Fockers," De Niro as a comic lead? Why not!
","So in the first movie you had Ben Stillers character playing the main player. Or hero if you will. He was the one who had to go through all the trouble. A journey as some say. This time around, it's time for Robert De Niro's character has to go on a journey. His character has to evolve.And if you're fine with that idea, than you might enjoy the movie. Although the comic premise does promise many good things, not all are played out. But still it's funny enough. The new addition to the cast of the first movie fit in nicely. The Fockers (Dustin Hoffman and B. Streisand) are funny, although sometimes they do seem to overact a little bit. Of course they have to be the exact opposite of the Byrnes, because only then the humor works! It's fun, it's light, nothing more nothing less! :o)",7,0,0,12 May 2007
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Ring: Beginning
","I never came around to read the LotR books before watching the movies and I actually haven't done that until now (so maybe shame on me), but I did read 30-40 pages of the Hobbit. And it seems, like almost everyone of those pages turns out to be in the movie. It's a big scene and it feels like Peter Jackson put almost everything in it. He apparently also put other Tolkien related stuff in it.Which he must have done, because how could you make 3 movies/parts out of one book? That is smaller in size than the original Rings trilogy that is. But what about the movie? It feels fun and it looks good (once you get used to the HD framing, which makes a few props look very plastic). Also the very HD 3D (or should I say the extra FPS) we got served made the movie feel like it was on fast forward. I think your eyes have to get used to that (in comparison to normal frames per Second that every other movie uses).Apart from the technical point of view, this is a well made movie, but it never completely touched me. It is well played and it has the beginning of a great adventure, but it feels a bit over bloated. I will obviously watch the other parts too and I'm pretty sure they will up the ante",7,7,12,5 July 2013
Before Sunset," Long time coming
","So it took them a few years to make this happen. But it was worth the wait (if you waited that is). The script is exceptional once again, with dialog that doesn't feel like it is scripted. Some might even argue that this is slightly (or a lot) better than the original film this is based on. Whatever the case, we have one of the rare occasions, where a sequel does not fall off quality wise.You have to like romantic drama or stories about life in general to really get into this of course. But with the trilogy and this being the second part of it, you should know what you are getting yourself into. Good acting and a scenario that takes the characters and the time that has passed and gives us a spin on it. Watch chronological!",8,0,0,12 August 2013
Non-Stop," No Pit stop
","Which kinda would be difficult since this plays in midair. Liam Neeson would obviously never have guessed he'd become an action hero this late in his career, but Taken did push him into things like this. There was also The Grey which felt a bit like The Thing from Carpenter but with different kinds of beasts. The question this raises is: Is Liam Neeson a beast himself (well the character he's playing)? Depending on your view on things, this may be interesting.We get a few clichés, though I have to admit, I did not see one of the things coming. The guessing game is not a bad one, even though it does stretch the logic bit a little. But the movie is fast paced and has a thrilling edge to it, so it won't bore you. A nice thriller that does everything it is expected to do. More than good entertainment value. Nothing less, nothing (much) more",8,1,2,2 August 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Another story
","This is not an origin story, but it does mix a couple of things nicely in here about the past and about family and many other things. So while it also does what (good) sequels do best (questioning existing relationships and expanding on the universe that was created), it also takes a step back, which isn't easy to pull off.The voice talent from the first is back again and if you don't have an issue with their voices (or the actor/comedian) in general, you will be glad they did. The story once unfolded is very straightforward and is predictable. But that does not take away any of the fun or the action that is really nicely 'drawn' here. The pacing is good and it is a good follow-up (makes sense to watch the first one, though I haven't seen the TV show yet, so I can't comment on how that connects with the movies).",8,2,6,24 September 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Hotel Business
","If you are about to watch a Wes Anderson movie, you should know what you are letting yourself into. The quirky, offbeat, weird and somewhat unpredictable nature of his movies, will either be a draw or a setback. Depending on what your viewing behavior is, you'll either enjoy the really out there feeling of this or you won't. Normally I'd think I'm not telling you anything new, but then again, you just might not have seen any of his movies (yet).The cast is more than stellar, even in the smaller roles inhabited here. And it's not so much about the story, than it is about things happening. While this also tends to have a violent side to it, it's the dialog that will hopefully entice you and keep the 'tension' high. If you're not sure watch the trailer, if it is appealing watch, otherwise don't waste your time",8,4,7,8 August 2014
The Favourite," Back in time
","And by that I don't mean back in time as what the director did in his first efforts. But back in time like in middle ages. The director has come a long way and while I wasn't a fan of Kinetta (and I stand by that and my review, even if I might phrase certain things differently nowadays), there is a way, a journey that he took and a development too.Though I reckon he always had something in him and he always believed himself. The acting is superb, he has a trademark humor and the setting is clear. You should not be easily offended and by his standards the movie is pretty straightforward ... if that sounds like fun (which it is), then go ahead and enjoy yourself - don't expect the movie to resolve everything or hand you all the answers you might have though",9,2,3,17 June 2019
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," It happens
","You could argue that the 'sh' is missing, but then again it works like it is too. And things happen of course ... but not like they happen in the movie that is. But that's why it's a movie. And still the writers have put quite a bit of thought into this and it is more then coherent. Well as much as a movie with a crazy premise (as seen here) can be of course.After seeing Alan Tyduk in Firefly, I've seen him in two comedies. Apart from this also in the 'Death at a Funeral' (the UK version that is). And he is genuinely funny. And he fits really good in this one too. The comedy almost never feels forced either (which is a big deal with movies that have a 'high concept' as this one). Watch it and be entertained",9,11,23,26 December 2010
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission rebooted?
","Of course this is a continuation (with a touch of Abrams still left in, see opening sequence/actor for that), but it feels like a fresh new injection into the franchise. No matter what you think of Tom Cruise, you can't deny the appeal of this movie in its action scenes. The biggest winner for this movie are those set pieces that do involve the area they are taking place in.And it's great scenes (you may have seen a few stills or some glimpses of Dubai in the trailer) that probably look even better in IMAX (unfortunately I didn't have the opportunity to watch it there). Simon Pegg is great for comedy relief and you kinda hope this team will make another movie together. Seeing 'survivors' of previous entries return is great too.",8,1,4,24 March 2012
Revolutionary Road," Road to Perdition
","Kate Winslet and Leo reunite after their Titanic ... experience. And while I still have resisted to watch the highest grossing movie ever, I was really anxious to watch this one. A friend of mine had told me, that it was one of the best movies he had watched in 2009. While some movies suffer from high expectations, this one didn't. It's high class drama (if there is such a word/phrase), dark and really 'brutal' (not in an explicit kind of way).Acting wise, Kate and Leo really give their best, but they have strong supporting cast to play with. There is one in particular, who also plays the part of comic relief. This is not a comedy (far from it), but those rare moments of comic relief are really needed and thrown in, at the right moments. If you thought, American Beauty was dark and twisted ... you ain't seen nothing yet (until you watch Reservation Road that is)!",10,0,0,10 December 2009
Foxcatcher," Didn't see that coming
","If you have a movie that at first sight is about an athlete and his (olympic) dreams, you kind of can guess where the movie goes. And even though there are a few things that you can predict, there's a lot left unsaid and a lot more that might surprise you (especially if you aren't aware of the real life incidents that occurred, something that can be said about me).So while this is overcoming the odds, it is also about struggling and living in a world that is not that appreciated, not having much of a family to back you up (or a mother that might push you to do certain things, although everyone is responsible for their own actions of course). The dynamic between the actors is really good and you might have problems recognizing Carrell. Also some nice interviews on the disc about the making of the movie",8,3,4,23 June 2015
28 Days Later...," Walk like a (romero) zombie
","Well not really, but that's not the point, I was trying to make. I just thought of the song, walk like an Egyptian and considering the pace of the zombies on hand here, I mixed it with that. i hope that was somehow clear enough, for everyone to understand! If not just ask/write me! But back to the movie, that has two obvious Romero nods (the grocery store scene, a 'special' zombie, which reminds fans of 'Bub' ('Day of the Dead') and more or less the complete third act, which also looks like a 'Day of the Dead' nod). And maybe some more, but not that apparent. The horror scenes are good, especially the beginning with it's images that might haunt you for a while (London, like you've never seen it).",7,0,1,10 October 2007
Lawrence of Arabia," Epic (role)
","With a stellar (male) cast, this movie can deservedly call itself an epic. The scope/cinematography (I saw the 70 mm version of the film), the storytelling, the grand music that is used and acting of course, elevate the whole experience.While I had my fair share of problems with film music before (see There will be Blood), I do like the composition and the use of it here. The acting could be called overly dramatic, but it fits very nice with the grand scope of the whole story(line). One of the most interesting facts and something people mostly don't realize: There's no speaking role for a woman in this movie. Not that it matters or makes the movie less effective, it's just a nice little piece of trivia. If you have the endurance to watch a long movie/drama, than there is no reason to miss on this one!",8,1,2,13 April 2009
It Follows," Guard your body
","If you like horror slowly creeping up at you, you might be able to like a lot. You have to suspend your disbelief a lot. The characters seem to live for the movies purpose only. Which is to scare you in a real slow moving way.. The direction and the setups are really good, but you do wonder if the characters could be doing more. Not to mention the whole dimension of what is implied (that is only hinted at, which you either relish or hate).Acting is really good and the mood gets transported in an old school way of horror. We might see the beginning of an 'IT' or Scream Girl/Queen. Although she doesn't scream that much in her other movie (The Guest, a weird and good mix of genres), she has a lot to fear here. The beginning alone of this movie sets the bar really high. Can it keep it that high in your estimate?",7,6,29,22 November 2014
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Going Ape ...
","Or as they called the movie in Germany: Prevolution. But let's not get into the title game (I'm not gonna spell that for you). Let's focus on the movie. It might have taken them a lot of time to come with another Ape movie (after the 're-imagening' Tim Burton unleashed upon us), but it was worth the wait.We have another reboot (sort of), which tells us, that stands alone. And while that is true, it is nice to see all the nods to the classic ape movie! There is even a clip with Charlton Heston playing in the background in one scene. There is a quote from the original movie (I'm gonna say one word: 'paws'!) and other nods, that do justice to the ape-line. Great actors, great story (though you may know where it all leads too, it still is filled with tension and exciting to watch), very recommendable!",9,1,3,16 January 2012
City of God," Down and dirty
","This movie does not take any prisoners. Although I have not been into any 'favella' (= ghetto) and I don't really know if the movie depicts it realistically, I do know that it is a gripping story. About kids growing up in a violent environment. Not that this movie is an action movie. It's a drama, with action scenes in it.The style and the look remind you a little bit of a documentary, just to make things scarier/real. It fully achieves it's goal. The 'actors' (the director mostly used people who really live or lived in Brazilian ghetto) are superb too. And since the story is well written and told, there is nothing more you could wish for. Of course if watch it in it's original version and don't speak Portuguese, than you will have to read the subtitles ... but it's more than worth it (and I personally prefer it that way)",9,7,11,2 April 2007
Cars," Not the best Pix(c)ar
","But even so, it's not a bad movie. Yes it is flawed in the sense that this movie might appeal more to the kids and not so much to adults (maybe the car 'maniacs', but even they might not like this entirely)! But still it is nice to watch this somewhat clichéd story, with a moral that everyone understands.Of course you have to suspend your disbelieve more than in other Pixar movies. Talking toys? Talking animals? You can see that sort of, but humanizing cars, was a difficult task to start with. But they did a really good job with that. Not everyone might agree with me on that, but I thought there were nuances and differences between the cars. And even if I had to accustom myself to the talking cars, I got there pretty quick! :o)",7,0,1,6 May 2007
Legend," Legends
","Having twice the fun is always nice. And while even van Damme went the route of having his twin brothers look different, this of course is an effort that has a different kind of quality. Tom Hardy (one of them in the movie) may be hard to understand with the accent and the way he speaks, but it sets him apart. And the characters are different, though they are exactly (or rather act, no pun intended) like siblings.There's love, there's hate, there is a lot of feelings and a lot of things going on. Even shades of Mean Streets can be found here, in the relationship of our two main characters. But they are based on a real life twin brother pair, which I had no inside before watching the movie. But I can only imagine that most of the things happening here, really happened. It's brutal, it's honest and it's really good (or bad if you're being literal)",8,0,1,26 November 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," Come together ... right now
","Well the movie we've been waiting for ... years! It's finally here and it doesn't dissapoint at all. You may nitpick and there are things to critisize as with all movies, but as a Universe Marvel did a fantastic job, setting characters up and giving us something to look for. So even the smallest things can make you chuckle (if you are like me and into that sort of stuff), like Groot and Captain America introducing themselves to each other. It's a character moment, but it's also as funny as it can be. And it is grounded into what we know about them and their attitude.So even when you have all that mayhem and all that fights going on, there is always time for other things. Quirky things, intelligent things and not just necessarily just social commentary (see Black Panther), but also dialog like the 'made up words' argument (very fine moment indeed). And again, I'm just giving you some simple moments, that really define how well thought out this all is. Not afraid to be self deprecating at times either.If you are able to avoid spoilers, please do and watch this to be surprised, to laugh, maybe even cry a little bit, but more important of all be entertained! I guess having to watch a few movies before this may seem like a chore for some, but once you start them and are not too negative about it, you will enjoy them ... just watched Ant Man and the Wasp and that was a hoot/blast too. But now I have to wait until next year ... for Captain Marvel and the 'conclusion' of this ... I have some ideas where it might go ... By the way there is 'only' one scene after the movie is over and it's after the credits ... sometimes you have to have room to breathe, so right decision!",9,1,5,5 August 2018
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Just please don't laugh
","Or if you think that people flying while they fight are funny, don't watch this movie with people who take this seriously. It was really hard to concentrate on the movie, while I was in a cinema watching it, because many people just started laughing every time they saw people jumping around (on houses or over them). It seems strange that most of them would accept the same style in a western movie which came out 1999 (I will not name the movie, so I won't spoiler it for you, though I'm pretty sure, most of you will know which movie I mean), but couldn't bare to see it in HK movie, just because this one was based in reality?But enough about that, there is more to be said about the movie here too. About the fine acting, about the story that evolves through the fighting ... which means, the fight scenes are not just some stunt action scenes, they do tell you a lot about the story. That is because they are choreographed to keep building up the story or concluding it. There is one moment, where the movie takes a deep breath (in other words it feels like it does full stop), but other than that, the flow is extra ordinarily good! If you like a little fantasy with your martial arts mixed with a strong story and a good cast, then you don't have to look further!",9,1,1,6 April 2007
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The long of it
","Let's get some things off my chest from the start. The movie itself felt like it could have been shorter. It didn't seem necessary to be so long. Also I am in the corner of people not happy about the depiction of Bruce Lee and the 'excuse' Tarantino came up with didn't really help that cause (first saying it's just fiction to then go on saying Bruce was like that/the way he portrayed him). Let's be clear, I never met Bruce, but the way he was depicted in here, felt disrespectful at times (making him look dumb for a joke that is also in the trailer).Having said all that, you do get the Tarantino genius and his flavor is there and can be seen overall. A friend commented on a scene (a dog being fed) and likened it to the relationship between Tarantino and the viewer. QT being Brad Pitt in that situation and the viewer of the movie being the dog. Patience is something that is rare and also something that Tarantino may not find in many viewers either.Acting is superb, editing is great and the story while far removed from the actual events, is fun to watch. So don't expect historical accuracy also don't expect Margot Robbie to talk much. That doesn't mean she doesn't have an impact. It also doesn't mean QT is sexist. It's just another thing critics will latch onto since there's no motherf'in Samuel L. Jackson here to just spew the n word.While mostly slow and really mellow, there are some violent moments in here that may be too much for some viewers. Be warned, this is Tarantino after all. And he can get explicit in his depiction of violence. This is also a movie that is able to grow on you, even after initial rejection ... but that will be up to you and your willlingness to think about it way after you watched it",8,0,0,4 December 2019
Behind The Candelabra," Broken Candelabra
","Or just plain 'Liberace' as it is called in Germany. I wasn't aware of much of his life as it is, but one things is obvious from the moment he steps on screen. And by 'he' I mean Michael Douglas as Liberace: He is into men! And Michael Douglas who is famous for being overly sexual with women playing that role is a big risk. Or one could think it is. But watching this, you could say this was a master plan.Matt Damon is of course the character we as viewers should feel attached to. And it makes sense (if you are not too homophobic), his actions and what he is doing in the movie. There are not too many erotic scenes in the movie, which the movie does need anyway and might help it with a straight audience too. Acting wise this is great, although I heard this was meant to be a TV production, it did play in theaters in the UK and Germany.Rob Lowe is back too and he has a phenomenal performance even though he is just a bit player. If you are not afraid of the story/content, you should be able to watch a very entertaining drama played out. How close it is to the truth? Again, I can't comment on that, I can only say that it was a thrill to watch",9,1,3,27 October 2013
Beasts of No Nation," Outrage
","You know when you hear other people whining about not being nominated for an Academy Award and you watch this movie, you kind of should be able to see through those other people. It's a real shame though that Idris did not get nominated and also the kid, the main star of the movie, whose giving a powerful performance.But if you don't care about nominations and/or wins, but do care about really powerful movies, that do challenge you, you shouldn't care anyway. You should just watch this and be awed by it. It's really good and it will stay with you. It seems like an accurate look at states without real leadership. Where any party thinks they are the good guys and therefor are allowed to do what they want ... But is it that easy? And how do you get people to follow you? There are some tricks of course and you will see some depicted here ... watch but beware that this is not made for entertainment purposes only",9,3,4,12 January 2017
Gone Girl," Bye bye
","I haven't read the novel, so I cannot compare the movie with it or tell you if David Fincher changed anything (for better or worse). So I can only judge this movie without anything in the back of my head comparing anything. Being free of that, I can say that I really loved this movie. I had my expectations and even having seen the trailer, I was surprised by quite a few things that happened in it.Performance wise you get more than great work. Ben Affleck might have gotten a lot of backlash, because he got cast as Batman (his Daredevil stint might have to do a bit with that and his Gigli movie), but he's showing here that he can act. The movie also shows us depths of human behavior we wish didn't exist, but we know they do. This really does go out there, with (some) nudity and violence, so it's not for the squeamish. The story alone though might have a bigger and harder punch for some, than anything shown ...",9,1,5,3 April 2015
Mr. Nobody," Gilliam universe
","Of course I understand if someone says/thinks this is pretentious. But if you're a fan of weird Science Fiction and/or Terry Gilliam, you should feel right at home. This really out there movie, gives you a lot to think about (if you're up for it). It's also kind of a twisted version of Lola Runs.It just takes that 'what would happen if' concept to another level (or is it dimension?). Every decision you make has consequences. The bigger the decision the bigger the consequences obviously. Which doesn't mean that small things don't matter. Quite the opposite, but the movie has to concentrate on a few things and it does so very well. Nicely acted and maybe not the easiest movie to follow this is executed very well ...",8,8,10,14 May 2015
Django Unchained," Beautiful and violent
","Sometimes the German equivalent of the MPAA can surprise us all. Not only did this movie get a rating (uncut), it also passed with a '16'. I'm always happy, when they pass a movie uncut, so I won't complain. That doesn't mean, I'm not wondering what is going on in the heads of some of those people who decide what rating a movie gets. The movie even got some heat in America for its violence (then again it also got some heat, because of its male lead. One party decided it wasn't a good example for white people to be killed by a black guy, the other side thought it was unfair in its depiction of black people and so forth)! Saying it lead to people becoming violent(?).Apart from those discussions, what can be said, is that Tarantino did it again. A great movie, with superb performances by everyone involved. Who'd have thought Kerry Washington would have to learn German for a role? Not me, but the inclusion of Waltz, Tarantino favorite and rightfully so, made this happen. And while Waltz almost steals the movie, it's still very much a Jamie Foxx picture.",9,0,2,14 July 2013
Get Out," Or stay ... and watch
","Actually if we're not talking about characters in the movie, but the viewers of the movie, I urge you to stay and watch. This is a clever horror comedy, that does play with the viewers expectations and is also a powerful message. You could almost say a social commentary. But it's really about having fun at the movies.And one character especially is very entertaining and does everything he can to keep things light. The combination of being funny but also scary is a difficult one, but the movie walks that fine line very nicely. Some people took issue with the theme and the bad guys in this and how or rather what they represented. But if you really have issues with that, than the issue lies within yourself. It's a completely different thing not liking a movie because you're just not into it and one arguing it is unfair to you in its depiction ... you've revealed much about yourself I'd say.It was about time someone made a movie like this and it sets a pretty high standard! Great script, great performances, a nail-biter ...",9,10,19,5 August 2017
Get Out," Wrong time, wrong place
","I'm not comparing this to an action movie that had a tag line you might be reminded of. The tag line seems to be fitting though. And while this can be considered both a comedy and drama, it has issues in it, that might be tough to swallow for some. There is a reason why some thought this was racist ... towards white people.Yes I had to laugh about that too! Putting silliness aside, because this can also be considered as dead serious horror. But also as relevant socially speaking. And entertaining. So while the movie delivers stereotypes and plays with them, it also shows things that are lying there - some are in the open others are more hidden. Still racism and discrimination is a thing - why not have 'fun' depicting it and hopefully learn something from it?",9,1,5,31 August 2018
Drive," Fantastic Voyage
","Let's get one thing out the way from the get go: While I do like the 'Fast & Furious' franchise for what it is (I'm not really a car person), do not watch this expecting something similar. It's tough making predicaments and telling people to watch something or to steer clear of certain things. But I knew when I told a friend to stay away from this, that he would hate it. Sure enough, he told me later he didn't like the movie at all. How'd I know? Because he thought 'Being John Malkovich' was bad too (I'm not comparing those either, just trying to convey, that this is more a 'head' movie, than a 'gut' movie).While terribly overlooked by the Oscars (and the Globes for that matter, only one nod each), this is superior filmmaking. Refn will be known to his fans for the Pusher trilogy, but also for the movie 'Valhalla Rising' (which btw. was hated by most people in the video store I work ... goes to show you what taste they have. And I don't mean that in a negative fashion, they just like their Blockbusters more).Ryan Gosling is superb in a role that has him talk as little as possible. I almost thought the entire beginning was 'voice-less' until I watched it again. Also the title 'Drive' does not necessarily stand for driving per se. It can also mean the motivation, the inspiration in ones life. Something that makes us continue on our 'journey'.I haven't even touched the surface of the movie yet. One of the greatest things (besides the acting, the story, the cinematography ...) is the soundtrack. The electro pop is fitting as is Goslings outfit. While not original (and therefor the only category I'm not mad the Oscars didn't nominate the movie) the score almost elevates the movie onto a new higher level.Don't get it twisted though. This isn't just 'artsy' filmmaking. There is pulp mixed in there too. And blood and violent action for that matter. Maybe my film 2011 (definetely in my Top 3)!!!",10,2,7,10 March 2012
Aladdin," Wishes are ...
","If you make a movie now, you have to consider many things. To a degree that might make a cynic cringe. But political correctness is a good thing (mostly) I would say. Stretching the 'wishes' definition on the other hand ... considering all the things the Will Smith does ... but let's not get ahead of ourselves.If you can shut of your brain, and just enjoy the ride (you can't write about this without that pun now can you?). It is predictable, it has lots of music and it is quite colorful. It also has questionable character development and other things that may spoil things, but again only if you let them. So yes this is quite flawed but well intentioned overall. My inner cynic lost the battle and I went with a 7 instead of a 6 ... maybe I am wrong ... too low or too high. It's your turn to rub .. I mean watch the movie if it sounds like fun times for you",7,0,0,14 June 2020
Insidious," Classic Horror ... with a twist
","Obviously this is trying to emulate and recreate things that have worked in the past and is very 'oldschool' in its approach. But not the whole way through, because towards the end, this does take a bit of an unexpected turn. I think it does so successfully, but there are quite a few out there who would disagree.So while there are movies out there, where you can decide after a couple of minutes what you think of a movie and if you should continue watching, this might either surprise you badly towards the end or actually make you think, that it is better than you though to begin with. Horror (especially one without much blood or violence) does rely on scares ... this has a few very good ones",7,0,0,5 June 2014
The Theory of Everything," Everything is (not always) awesome
","Just when Lego made you think that everything is awesome, you get the cold actual (facts) theory of everything. Joking aside, this movie is a tough watch, though it does have its light moments. Everyone who is only a little bit aware of our main character in this movie, know where this is going to go.So while we know where this is going, it's still crushing, because we get to see the before, we get to see the person, that many have forgotten when they watch what he has become now (chair and voice and all). Maybe we can relate to that, but we certainly can relate to a human being watching and feeling pain, unable to do something about it. Still not giving up though ... There might be clichés along the way and it might be heightened (who knows all the truth though), but it makes a very powerful movie.",9,0,2,14 June 2015
Bolt," Funny, but
","I really do have a problem with movies, that try to be SO clever, when in fact they are not. I won't spoiler anything big, I'll only talk about the beginning of the movie, but I still wanted to warn people who are not ready to read anything about the movie, before they go watch it or rent it.The problem here is, that while we get treated to an action movie, without apparent cuts, without any obvious special effects (yes I know it's animated), the fact that the first couple of minutes are a movie within a movie is a big cheat. Not because you might get fooled to think that is the actual movie, before they pull the rug under your feet (there are other movies, who had these beginnings too), but because everything that happens there just couldn't happen.I know it's animated, so in fact it couldn't happen either way and then it's a movie, so it isn't real by definition. But still the main Dog (Bolt) does stunts, that he isn't able to do. Leaps/jumps as if gravity didn't exist, just to have a problem jumping in the 'real world' ... I can't laugh about that, because it ain't funny to me, because in the end, he couldn't jump that far in the first place.So everything that gets build up in the first minutes is a big cheat, which doesn't work and therefor isn't funny in the progress of the movie, when all the 'superpowers' get smashed (even the stunt driver explanation doesn't work and don't get me started on 'where do they put their cameras? Everywhere? With a focus on everything?) Again, that might seem short sighted for some, but I couldn't enjoy the movie as much as I would have loved to (and the Hamster is really mostly funny, plus a 'nice' cat). The flow of the movie isn't right, if things get established ... but actually aren't established, because they are lies/cheats. If you can overlook that, you might enjoy the movie more than me (I still gave it 4/10, because it has it's moments, that aren't inspired by some false predicament in the beginning)",4,3,10,14 June 2009
Frozen," Frozen, but still animated
","I'm not sure why anyone would see this as an affront to men and boys in general, but I guess that's why we are so different in seeing things and describing them. While for me this does have too much music (two songs less would be nice) and too little of the snowman we came to enjoy in the trailer, it still is a more than satisfying movie.Does it have stereotypes and some weird characters (the round ones, you'll see, when you see them)? Yes absolutely! But does it stand in the way of the story? Never. Even the twist, which is a nice one, can be seen as either good or bad. I liked it, even though it was convenient, but you needed it with the story at hand. There is some darker passages here, but it still is a children's story. One that works",8,6,9,7 June 2014
2012," 'Event' movie
","It's always amusing to read and/or hear people going on about the realness (or better lack of it) of event movies like this. Something along the lines like: That (stunt) couldn't really happen in real life! Really? Is that all you got about this movie? It's not real? Isn't a movie 'not' real by definition? So if you really criticize something about this movie, let it be the story (or parts of it), that just don't work out quite as well. But as with most thrillers, the movie picks up pace, so that you don't have time to think about a few things, that really shouldn't be happening. But again, starting to pick too much on those things, why go watch the movie in the first place? I knew what I was going to get and it was more or less what I expected. I was kinda surprised to see that many nationalities on screen. Woody H. was quite funny, although not fully 'used' (imo). So despite quite a few things that didn't work (always in the context of the movie), you can have some fun with this.",6,1,3,13 December 2009
Ghost Rider," Extended entertainment
","I only watched the extended version on Blu Ray, so I cannot vouch on how this fairs compared to the theatrical cut. I can say, that it is much better than the 'reboot' or whatever you wanna call 'Ghost Rider 2', which is just plain ridiculous! They might have been good for Crank, but the directors either have lost their touch or the formula just didn't translate onto the rider.But let us talk about this movie. A fair and balanced story, that has it's clichés but has some nice effects to back that up. Good action scenes and a story that works (for those not familiar with the comic books that is). Nic Cage playing a moderate Ghost Rider, which kinda works!",5,0,0,8 May 2012

I'm not an X-Men junkie, or anything (I'm not familiar with the comics and/or the characters), so I can't speak about the history or if Bret Ratner did a great job, of putting those characters on screen, as they were drawn/intended to be ...Still I feel that this movie does tie together the previous efforts, made by Bryan Singer. This is just one fun ride. And right from the start (a few minutes in maybe), Ratner let's you know, that anything goes! That he doesn't think that anything is sacred, might be too much for some fans to swallow, but I loved it. You could also say 'Balls to the walls'!

The Lives of Others," East vs. West
","No not another rap war, this is the East against West (Berlin/Germany) war, if you will. But not 'war' in the common sense of the word. More like an espionage drama. This movie is about the 'Stasi' (Staatssicherheit, which means something like 'public security' if you type it in the babel-fish translator ...) and how they 'watched' people and how they handled people they thought were traitors to East Germany's believes! That is of course only the setting, the real story concerns two people, who live and breathe in this system. Saying/writing more, would spoil the 'fun' (if you can use this word, for such a matter) of the movie. I do recommend you watch it and see how people might have lived under this suppression ...",8,2,7,25 April 2007
Room," Inside out
","But that title was already taken. Also Room is pretty accurate and hits 'home' (no pun intended). But while I had no idea what I would get with this (apart from the title and the lead actress I didn't know one piece of information), most will go into this knowing what it's about. The general idea is explained fairly quickly, though the why of the closed space or rather location and the reason for staying might take a while to sink in.If you already know some of the whys because of the trailer or reading the story, don't be afraid though. The movie moves forward and it does not stay stagnant at all. That is true regarding the story, but the characters have some other issues to solve. Talking about solving, you won't get all the answers for this, but this is a pretty good and strong depiction psychologically speaking of what persons go through, without getting into their heads. Great acting and drama make this a great movie ... if you like the genre that is of course.",9,5,10,28 October 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," So many great moments
","Actually just one of them would make me want to give this a 10/10 and it is very close in my eyes. The scene I'm talking about involves a helicopter and a song that really got under my skin. If you don't feel a thing during that scene ... well I don't know what to say. The whole thing is build upon feelings and dreams. Obviously breaking out of them and making some of it reality (not the ones that can not be achieved obviously, like flying or other stuff) is the ultimate goal.Ben Stiller might be known for one thing, but we can see with this movie he has a wider range. And the visual/virtual effects he uses help support his vision. A vision of a novel that I haven't read, but sounds more than intriguing even after you've watched the movie. Which cannot be said about most of novels/movies that have been made this way. This is not your typical movie, even though it might hit some familiar notes and go ways that are to be expected. Take the journey and fly with it ...",9,12,16,18 June 2014
The Lion King," Not Original
","I really have to rewatch the Original movie from the 90s. I remember I really liked it a lot. Having said that, for those who haven't seen that, they might be quite smitten by this effort. For those who hold it in high regard this might feel like an insult. As with many cases, the truth is somewhere in the middle.The animation or rather the visuals or whatever you want to call the real life depictions of almost everything, is quite astonishing. So if nothing else this really looks good. The story is proven to engage, so they couldn't go wrong with that either. But they did add stuff and moved pieces around. Having a song that should play at night time sung during the day may be quite off putting. Other might feel that is nit-picking. Try to enjoy this for what it is, not what the original was ... otherwise it is more than likely you'll be dissapointed",7,0,1,15 January 2020

If they continue like that, the Top 100 List here on IMDb will solely exist/consist with their movies in there! Seriously though: The Incredibles takes the Superhero movie genre and takes it's own spin on it. I wouldn't say it spoofs the Superhero world, it just a funny movie, that happens to play in a world with Superheroes. Of course the voice talent on hand here does the story justice, as with the other Pixar movies. A fun-filled adventure that you shouldn't miss.",8,1,1,21 July 2009
The Mist," Clear Vision
","Frank Darabont of 'Shawshank' fame has made yet another Stephen King film/movie adaptation. More Horror than Drama this time around, you might be excused of having doubts about the cast. Thomas Jane in particular, better known for his action roles (Punisher). Can he carry this movie? My answer is yes. Of course he has many good actors that support him, but he's the main guy and the movie would have fallen, if he wouldn't have been up for the task. There are some bumpy moments (cliché bordering at times), but the actors make them work alright.Depending on if you read the book (I haven't), or read the plot line/saw the trailer, you have already gathered informations about the movie. I went in without knowing anything, other than it sounded a bit like an unofficial FOG (Carpenter) Remake. Let me tell you that apart from the FOG part, it has nothing in common with that movie! Chilly and character driven it is and it has an ending that might leave some people crying and other cheering (not literally though I guess) ... I liked it",8,1,4,6 July 2008
I Am Legend," Worn out
","One can't stop thinking what could've come out as a movie/result, if Alex Proyas would have directed this movie? See his Dark City, if you haven't, to understand where I'm going with this (there's also a Directors Cut coming this year). It's kind of the same feeling many had when Resident Evil came out and were yearning for the George A. Romero version of it.But behold, I am Legend never goes completely off tracks, as Resident Evil did (that's of course in my humble opinion). While the director and the star (Will Smith) here try to make a decent (dark) horror drama, they don't really live up to the task. The movie has it's weird moments and some nice scary ... scares, but in the end, some plot holes, the not entirely convincing 'bad guys', a real bad turn in the third act, all add up to undermine what the movie had achieved previous to that point. The end is then a big disappointment, not because it's not clear (I did get the hints/signs, without seeing the Directors cut or alternate ending stuff), but because you came to expect more from it.I haven't seen any of the other adaptations nor did I read the book, but I can safely say that while Will Smith plays it straight, he's character is undermined by many script flaws. So he is flirting with puppets/mannequin(s), but only comes back as a boomerang at the end (if you watch the movie you know what I mean). It's a shame then, that it hasn't succeeded in walking the thin line between entertainment and dark horror drama/study ....",6,1,1,9 July 2008
A Quiet Place," Don't say a word
","Actually it would be more, don't yell anything or a word, but you get what I'm saying anyway. This builds tension and has a very succesful part towards the end of the movie. But the build is a bit ... well yes there is a shock moment with which the movie begins. Something that while you kind of expect it, you still may be baffled they went with it.Having said, after that punch in the gut, we get a slower pace and approach, but with quite a few holes in the story or rather the way the characters interact. Maybe it's good for the tension not to have a soundproof room, but when it comes to logic, you do wonder how suicidal that makes the characters ... Also a big reveal towards the end might make you go: Really? No one else discovered this? For fans this may feel like nitpicking and let's be clear, this is a good movie overall. But having so many things that feel convinient and don't make too much sense, take a bit away from the greatness the movie could have had - imho that is of course. Still a sequel is coming - surprise surprise (not)",7,0,1,22 April 2019
The Bourne Legacy," Bourne to do this
","If a franchise is as successful as the Bourne franchise is/was, it is inevitable that there will be a follow up. Even if everyone was saying that the series was always meant to be trilogy. If you can overcome that fact and are able not to hold a grudge against the producers or anyone else involved in the making of this, you might be able to enjoy a fairly decent action thriller.Jeremy Renner is the man when it comes to casting action roles of late. After his performance in 'Hurt Locker' he did rise pretty fast. If the Avengers were incomplete, he might have gotten a bigger role in that one too. You can see why he is such a wanted man (no pun intended) in this movie too. Rachel Weisz has not that much to do, but her performance does give the movie another gravitas. The action scenes are superb, but we expected that (especially if we watched the trailer). Nice hints to the original movies too. Before you cry out, watch it is what I'm trying to say.",7,3,5,3 January 2013
22 Jump Street," Worthy sequel
","It doesn't happen often, that I think a sequel is at least as good as the original movie. But this kind of even topped the original. It's really great, because it is so self aware. Not only of itself, but in general (talking sequels or its stars, especially Channing Tatum makes fun of himself a lot). You'll either cherish and are delighted by this fact or you don't really care.If you do care and have seen the original (Ice Cube also returning), you will love where this is going. Sometimes it's borderline mental (story-wise), but in the end it all makes 'sense'. Well as much sense as this can make. Obviously this was very successful and another sequel might be on its way (curious to see who's going to cameo in that then) soon. Ideas where this might go? Probably not the ones discussed during the end credits of the movie ... which gives the viewer a lot 'sequel ideas' to go home with .. or sleep on! ;o)",9,9,20,24 September 2014
School of Rock," Pool of Energy
","While Jack Black is a pool of Energy and was really involved in the making of this movie (which can be seen in the Extras of the DVD/Blu Ray or whatever format will be next), I still wasn't entertained as much as I hoped for. By far not a bad movie, but just not really a funny one.To be more specific, there was only one scene, where I was genuinely laughing ('touched by'-scene is all I'm saying, watch the movie and you'll know what I mean). Despite all his efforts it just seemed they tried to contain Jack. Which is why I think the Tenacious D movie is quite funnier (although quite a bit more ... let's say strange, in it's story telling).",5,1,3,21 July 2009

","Pixar does not treat its viewers like children. Literally as can be seen in this case/movie too. And that is what I like about their movies. They don't make the movies thinking about what kids would like to see, as they have often stated. They make movies they love to watch themselves. And while Cars (the first movie) might have been the 'worst' movie Pixar has done so far, it was still way above some other animated movies from other studios.Still as much as I love Cars 2 (and giving Mater an arc), this probably will be the year remembered, when Pixar didn't win the animated Oscar! But back to Mater: He might not be everyones cup of tea and he has an accent that some might not like from the get-go. But the car is funny. And while I have seen a website that took offense by the design of the cars themselves, this shouldn't really be an issue. Enjoy this light version of an agent/spy story! :o)",7,0,1,10 January 2012
Kick-Ass," To be (superhero) or not to be (superhero)?
","If I had rated it immediately after I watched it, I would have given it a lower rating. Why is that? One big inconsistency that almost ruined the movie for me. While it makes fun and is pretty gritty and real at the beginning, when Nic Cages character (plus the girl) come into play, it gets into a complete different gear. And (almost) everything that got made fun of before, is now treated pretty seriously. That's a big risk and very thin line, the movie walks there.Now of course, most people might not even care and just enjoy the ride. And that's what you should do probably too. Plus I'm happy for the director, who's previous movie didn't quite make what I expected it to make (Stardust is a really good movie, maybe a bit too complex for it's own good ... which is almost true for this one too).One thing is for sure, it doesn't hold any punches (or kicks for that matter) and as many have said, this might be the role to get Mr. Cage back on track again, after a few missteps. Plus the fact, that it is so different, makes it a really genuine beast. Something like Scott Pilgrim does not jump back and forth and is more in tune throughout, in contrast to this movie ...",8,0,6,4 October 2010
Unknown," Cliché ridden
","I won't go into the fact that it doesn't make any sense (the plot that is), because many action/thrillers have that in common. But even while it does go by the handbook (and checks every little available thing in there) it never fully reaches anything that should be able to touch you. The streets of Berlin may never have looked better, the actors in it, probably have though.There might be a surprise or two hidden somewhere in the very ridiculous plot, but the cardboard cutouts (also called characters) may give you a had time caring. I still gave it 5 points, because it is after all decent. I have seen worse, but I have also seen a lot better.",5,4,6,9 November 2011
Call Me by Your Name," My summer vacation
","Or something along those lines. Since this was nominated at the Oscars, even if you tried to shield yourself from any spoilers, you just couldn't. But even knowing where this is going does not take any fun away from watching it. Unless you have an issue with what this movie is about. There are signs of love and rejection early on and there still is more love laying around.I'd say our protagonist (the younger one) has quite some issues and he is far away from being nice (see how he handles someone who has a lot of affection for him), but that may be because he is confused. Because what he feels is 'forbidden' and frowned upon. Still you may feel rather dissapointed an some of the stuff he does (and I don't mean the things that may qualify as 'gross', but human interaction), don't forget he's (still) a boy ... Very well acted and more than decent in all other compartments too",8,2,4,29 June 2018
Gran Torino," Mature and great drama
","While the trailer might have led you to believe this could be another episode of Dirty Harry (Callahan) or 'What would a retired Dirty Harry do?', this is a much complexer movie/story. Yes the character depicted here by Clint Eastwood, has some similarities with his 'Dirty Harry' character, but 'in the end', he's very different from him (you will get what I mean, if you watch the movie).Watching Clint act, you wonder how he does it. It seems that he doesn't put much effort in his interpretation of his role, but he still manages to be spot on, even with a small wrinkle or grunt, he can convey more than some other actors could, in a couple of minutes/sentences. I'm happy that while he's dedicated more time to direct movies, he still finds the time to act too (in this case doing both things), finding roles for himself that have an arc woven into the story. Great, simple and powerful -> Clint Eastwood.",9,1,5,20 July 2009
Shrek the Third," A few good moments, but ...
","... doesn't make a good movie! I think my nephew, my niece and her friend enjoyed the movie more, especially because of the fact that Justin T. played in this one too. Although they tried to come up with good new ideas, many just didn't work out (for me). One thing is sure though: A 'Puss-N-Boots' spin-off could be really great, especially if Donkey is in it too.The chemistry between the two of them in this movie (and a 'crazy' thing that happens to them) does elevate it. Although it seems like Antonio Banderas got the cooler lines than Donkey, it didn't bother Eddie Murphy. I personally think, as far as Shrek goes they should stop with this one ... A donkey spin-off would be great too, but no more Shrek for me please! (Edit: I take that last sentence back and hope they stop with the forth Shrek movie!)",4,0,1,28 June 2007
The Hurt Locker," Tha Bomb (pun intended)
","A film that actually feels more like a documentary, this begins with a big bang (pun again intended). And whether you like what you see or not, it is absolutely well shot and executed (pun this time not intended). The actors are so into their characters that you don't realize they're only playing.The tension is high and I guess one of the few things you could criticize, is the fact, that the movie is pretty neutral and has not a big Anti-Iraq message. But that would be besides the point. Why does every war movie have to carry a social message like a stamp? This movie has finer, subtler attempts, while trying to convince you, what war is like. And therefor a lot better, than if it were trying hard to be preachy. A movie that has messages, but is more an examination of human behavior under certain circumstances, than anything else.",9,3,8,21 September 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Having fun with it
","I am a sucker for the Pirate movies, because I just still am a big fan of the Captain Jack Sparrow character. And that is just the movies, not to mention all the charity work Johnny Depp does by visiting Hospitals and what not in costume/character. But back to this, which brings back the fun and is relatively 'normal' when you take the story. It's not too complex, one of the things previous sequels were condemned for.We do get a bit of throwback by connections to previous movies, though generally speaking you don't have to have seen them to enjoy this. Though as every other Pirates movie this has a scene after the credits. Which generally makes you wonder if there will be more? This was supposed to be the last of them ... and it would make a good closing chapter ...",8,3,6,1 September 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Prevention
","I personally thought the last one was more entertaining than this one and I have to admit, I was surprised to see the high rating on this one. Box Office wise you couldn't tell people actually loved it. But maybe it'll get down eventually. And it's not that this is a bad movie or anything, it just has a couple of bumps along the road.The main bad guy seems almost wasted overall and since I don't know the comics, I can't tell you how accurate he is depicted (I can only say that he's being played really good). Apart from that we also have a really good end sequence (action), that really helps the movie out. There are relationships and other things that get explored and people have to decide (not always on their own free will), for whom they want to fight. It's decent, but it's not really great",6,1,3,4 February 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Getting down
","The movie starts off interestingly enough and Andrew Garfield almost falls into the Sam Raimi trap (Spiderman 3) where Tobey Maguire had a sequence where he 'tried' to be cool. Garfield though does kind of pull that off, even though it's very frenetic and does make little sense (other than to be revisited towards the end). Still Andrews Peter Parker is lovable (mostly).There is a sense of overload though and especially the character portrayed by Jamie Foxx is not playing well into all of this. It's a shame, because Foxx has proved that he can be part of a big movie (see Django Unchained), but he's not working here. The motives are clear in the big picture, but the way they do get 'unleashed' is not realized in the best way possible.Having said all that, the special effects are really good and if you let yourself into it, the movie will take you onto a ride. With a few surprises along the way ... well at least one for me!",6,2,8,17 September 2014
Ex Machina," Still Machina
","What makes us 'human'? Or superior for that matter? And would we able to share this with something we created? Call it Frankenstein (monster) or whatever else comes to mind, but the movie itself has quite a few things it wants to tell us. You might not feel or empathize completely with the main character (he's a bit shy and easy to impress, but he has to be) or with the guy who hired him.But especially 'bro' Oscar Isaak relishes in his role. And he has a tough one to play with. It's really a thin line he has to walk here. Is he a villain? Aren't there gray areas too? Should we judge him? Isn't he fun to hang around with though? Full of contradictions, as the movie itself. The science fiction idea of it (at least the current moment science fiction, who knows what the future holds for us) is either intriguing enough for you or it ain't. Whatever the case, the movie lived up to the hype surrounding it",9,2,7,5 July 2015
Back to the Future Part III," Wild West up Doc
","A bit of a riff on the what's up doc quote/line you may know from a completely different place. And a completely different place is where the movie goes. Because after the immediate past and the immediate future (30 years more or less can be considered that in my book), we get to the old West. And we pay tribute to the Westerns in many ways.One of them being Marty calling himself Clint Eastwood. A name that is synonymous with Westerns like almost no other (there's also the Duke of course). Again the chemistry between Doc and Marty is amazing and the backbone of the movie. This being shot back to back after the second one was finished really helped. Getting a trailer at the end of part 2 to get crowds or rather give them a taste was also very well thought of. Marketing wise it may have been a new milestone, a new way and path for others to follow.But money aside (and the trilogy made a lot of it), it seems we do end the movie series here. Even if there are always talks about sequels, I cannot imagine the original crew (or cast for that matter) to return for another run. Especially considering the health issues Michael J Fox has to handle. Having said that, this is a high note and a good way to end it all. A series that brought us or gave us very early performances in small roles by Billy Zane, Elijah Wood and Elisabeth Shue, to name a couple. But a series that especially made us fall in love with Doc Brown and Marty McFly ... knock knock: McFly, anyone home? Yes also a lot of memorable quotes too - Great Scott!",8,0,0,23 May 2020
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Could've been
","First of all, I haven't read the novels/books, so I can't say how close this is to the source material. I've heard that, the first movie (Twilight) didn't bring everything from the book onto the screen (which makes sense, because otherwise the source material would've been really slim/weak). While we had our introductions in the first movie (and I'm assuming you have either seen that or at least read the book), we should be able to have more 'fun' with the characters this time around ... well if you thought that, than you are very wrong!! The things K. Stewarts character (Bella) has to go through, come across. But while some additional stuff has been made up (or so I've been told), that wasn't in the book, to have a 'special' character with more screen time, this all adds up to a pretty dreadful experience.The acting wasn't really top notch from part 1. There is no reason for that. And I think the only one coming out of, mostly unscathed, is Taylor Lautner. And the girl who played in 'Up in the Air', forgot her name. But that's more due to the movie 'Up in the Air' than to her role in this one.While nothing much is happening (not only acting wise), the movie still tries to be as dramatic as it can be. The problem being, it isn't at all! And while there are a few nice action pieces, the whole thing feels utterly ridiculous, which makes it quite hard to really enjoy it. Again though, as with the first one, this was aimed at a female audience group and if you saw it in theaters, than you might have heard quite a few of them screaming. There is one 'special' scene that really made them happy ... and some guys too (although they might have been cynical)! While the scene as it is, didn't excite me and influenced my vote directly, the impact it has/had, does reflect in my vote, as well as the fact, that the target audience seems to love it ...",4,6,9,23 March 2010
Patton," Role Player
","George C. Scott is a blessing! What he delivers as Patton, in the lead role is just incredible. No wonder he got an Oscar nomination and won the thing, too! He transcends into his role and elevates the movie. This anti-war picture is a solid one, but without it's leading man, it would've only been another movie.At least that's what I felt, while watching the movie, and I had the pleasure of watching it theatrically, even in 2005. Watching it in all it's glory, was an amazing experience. If you haven't watched it yet, go out and rent or buy it (I'd like for you to see in a movie theater, but I doubt, you'll be so lucky) on DVD!",8,0,2,7 July 2007
The Illusionist," Watch again and look closely
","I was surprised at how this was, when I watched it. Strangely enough it didn't do well at the Box Office. Maybe people can only be bothered with one Magician movie at a time, the other being the Prestige, which there is no doubt about superior to this one. It still is a very good movie, with a powerhouse performance by (especially) Ed Norton and the other actors involved.The movie can be watched just as entertainment or you can actually read things into it. Both ways will be rewarding, so you don't have to get everything (intentionally put there or not) to enjoy it. If you do, good for you. I liked the way it was told and the fact it left room for you to interpret some things. There is rewarding second viewing in sight then ... If you care for it that is",8,1,2,19 October 2010
Grudge Match," The Balboa vs. La Motta fight we never got
","Yes De Niro and Stallone are pretty old by now. But this is not so much about the boxing (just in case you were wondering), although it will feel your need for that too. This is a comedy with really good actors who are having a lot of fun with it. Is there morality in it? Yes, but it is so nicely packed into the comedy that you really shouldn't mind at all about that.The script is nicely written too, with some added jokes during the credits, so stay tuned and don't prematurely end the movie. Give the old guys a chance and let them enchant you with their ability to make fun of themselves, life and anything in between. There are different endings to this movie too, but the one chosen was the best solution.",8,1,2,2 June 2014
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Backwards
","On a technical level this movie is amazing. David Fincher tries new boundaries and he succeeds. I haven't seen the making of yet, but people have told me about some things, that they have seen and it sounds amazing.Unfortunately I don't feel as 'touched' by the complete story. It does have a strong beginning and the acting is great. But at the end it seems more like bits and parts and not as a whole movie experience. Of course that symbolizes our life as it is (also bits and pieces and many different chapters, with different characters in them). But although I do like this aspect, I feel there could've been more.Maybe Mr. Fincher spoiled us with the movies he makes and I expected more. But whatever it is and although I do like the movie, I couldn't bear to give it more than 7/10 (which isn't bad at all in my book either).",7,0,2,14 June 2009
Transformers," Popcorn Flavour of the month
","Or even the summer as another reviewer stated! But before I start the review, I have to say/admit, that I don't or better didn't know much about the Transformers world, before I went out to watch the movie. So I can't tell you any differences between the movie and the series or if they forgot/missed something, reinvented the Transformers or anything like that.What I can tell you, is that this movie delivers exactly what it promises. Fun, action, cars and a hot woman. Is there anything else a movie needs? An actual plot you say? Seriously though, if you're going into this movie, than should know better than that. I checked some of Mr. Bays favorite things above ... a few others are: the always moving camera if an action scene is played out in front of you. The spinning camera around the hero(es) etc. etc. etc.The actors are great too (for a blockbuster), Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox! Some characters come short (come to think of it most of them) due to the amount of time spent on the action and/or comedy scenes in the movie, but that's OK. OK because it's what you can expect. So shut down your brain at the entrance and enjoy this ride. It's worth it (and I'm definitely nothing close to a Bay nor a Bruckheimer fan)!",8,3,7,10 October 2007
Pawn Sacrifice," Check Mate
","The artist previously known as Spiderman is playing games now. Well I guess that would be one (very wrong) way of describing this. While he comes off as a bit of a brat (to put it mildly) and I can't confirm how close to the truth this is based on, the overall story is pretty strong and the tension is there, even if you can figure out where this is going very early on.So if this was game of chess, you would feel like you know which pieces would be moved next and who would win in the end. Does it actually all happen like you imagine? Maybe not, but overall you can trust your feeling. Which does not take away too much from the movie, because it still works ...",7,0,0,17 September 2016
Men in Black II," Not as bad as you might remember it
","Plus it has the always reliable Rosario Dawson in it. Just for her you've got to love the movie (or at least not hate it, in my opinion). But this movie delivers on the same formula that made the first one a success. The earnest Tommy Lee Jones, who apparently had no idea, why people would think he is funny, or it's just a rumor. Whatever the truth, his straight face against the clownish Will Smith works perfectly as it did in MiB too.For some reason (maybe creative, maybe because it didn't succeed to top expectations), this was the last MI(I)B people had the pleasure watching for awhile. But of course a third one would be on the way. I wouldn't say it's necessary to watch the first one to get this, but it's always good to have some back-story.",6,0,2,16 July 2012
Magic Mike XXL," Strippers on a road trip
","You could fault the first Magic Mike for many things. But you couldn't say that it didn't have a story. Didn't matter if you liked it or not or if you didn't want to either see Dudes stripping or female nudity (the latter being said by a female friend of mine who minded that being on 'display'), it did have something to tell. Now why do I say that? Because this movie does not have anything to say at all.Apart from men stripping (whether they have their shirts on or off shouldn't matter, it's not always about the pecs and flesh, but about what they do with their bodies) - and there is enough suggestions as to what they'd like to do. While that may seem tame to some (see some other reviews), it does seem risqué to some others (again reviews checking). But it does not hide the fact, that this rode trip is boring. Jada Pinkett Smith was surprisingly not nominated for an Oscar - even more surprisingly it wasn't the reason she boycotted the Oscars (I am kidding but feel free to like or dislike the joke).While the movie knows it doesn't have any plot it also does not have enough jokes to keep it up ... Yes that also intended",4,2,3,30 April 2016
Hidden Figures," Power of the Will
","Or of the Kevin - yet another movie where he stands up for people that are being treated unfairly and badly. You can think this wears out with Costner, but you can also just let him do his thing (mostly succesful and enlightening) and enjoy the movies or just not watch them. This is not really hard to predict, but the performances make it special.There are moments that depending on your world view may seem like middle ages, but unfortunately they really happened (maybe exaggerated a bit for effect). There are things being said and done to our main characters that are beyond despicable. It would be easy to give up on many occasions, very easy. But then you wouldn't have a movie, now would you? For some it may be tougher to empathize but everyone who does will have some tough moments to live through with this ... but it's worth it",8,2,4,2 January 2020
Coco," Dia de los(t) muertos
","Dream big - quite literally. Especially when or if you think creatively. At least that is what the movie is telling you. And it's really a good movie. While I didn't get the 'short' about Olaf while watching this on Netflix, the movie worked on its own and maybe even better.Really well structured and told. The story of a young boy who has to overcome quite a lot of obstacles to reach or get to where he needs to be. Not just for kids, quite the opposite. This might work for adults even more than for the little ones. Though there is so much for them here too - effects, animals and dreams. Not too morbid if you were wondering",8,0,1,21 February 2020
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Very funny
","No seriously, it is very funny. There might be quite a few flaws with the script/idea behind it all, but the movie is moving along so quick you won't even notice them. And the voice cast assembled here? Just amazing! And getting 'Mr. T' of A-Team fame doing the voice of a cop, is just one of the greatest ideas ever! It's also very well written (within its premise that is of course) and has quite a few great moments. It's target audience is the younger audience (which is especially apparent when love comes into play), but does have quite some treats for the 'older' audience members too. If you like funny and light animated movies, this will be your cup of tea. Not quite the heights Pixar has climbed (because there is not that much depth to the whole thing), but very funny and worthwhile indeed",8,6,11,21 November 2009
1917," War - what is it good for?
","You never know - usually it is not good for anything. Especially when it comes to single man missions. And this has the backdrop of real war (written all over it). And it also has the one shot movie - you know when there is no visible cut and according to the filmmaker there wasn't any? I mean there is one moment where we go completely dark, so ... and there is always a possibility to cut. But they swear they didn't do it here, so let's take that at face value.The effects are great, the cinematography was a shoe in for the Academy Award ... and it won. Not a surprise. Having said that, there is enough excitement and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Masterfully played (especially if you think about how many takes it probably took to do this) and great production values. This is a masterpiece, no matter if the subject matter is your thing or not",10,1,4,31 March 2020
Lincoln," A. Lincoln
","Of course if you did watch this in 2012 or 2013, there is the elephant in the room that we have to talk about. Actually it's more a vampire hunter than an elephant, but you get the point. There was this other 'biopic' that wasn't actually accurate, though it did try to encapsulate Lincoln too. A more action orientated Lincoln that was. Daniel Day Lewis on the other hand, plays it very subtle. Actually he plays it so subtle, that Tommy Lee Jones is allowed to shine in a way, that you are not used seeing him.Of course Tommy Lee's 'character' does have great lines, but also serves a purpose. And while this movie is not meant to be political, it does show (or should show), that republicans once had some sense in them. You wonder where it all went, when you watch abominations such as Fox 'News'. But that's a different story (though it obviously will lead to 'helpful/not helpful' votes from some). Going back to the acting side, we also have Sally Fields in a very tough role. But she is more than convincing in that as well.Some write that Spielberg is maturing. He might be, but it's not like he wasn't able to direct before. It just might be, that his interests lie in different things now. You might still need to read a book, which isn't a bad thing, but the movie does serve a purpose and is entertaining",8,4,6,14 July 2013
Garden State," There's more to this Scrub than some might have thought
","If you only saw Zach in the TV show Scrubs you might feel weird seeing him in this. And if you also knew that he directed it, you might feel (prior to watching) that he is way over his head. I don't know if or how much help he got making this movie, but I do know that this comes off as a very assured effort.This drama lives also with the other cast members. You can never go wrong with Natalie Portman, but also any of the other actors. Their ability to go through the motions and sell the slow pacing of the movie is elevating the movie. Of course you have to be able to watch Dramas and have patience, but if you don't than this isn't for you anyway. Otherwise, watch and enjoy its weird look at life/youth in the early 'noughties'",8,0,0,11 July 2015
Event Horizon," Bad, bad, bad ... or in one word: Bad!
","Now for this 'special' movie, that I watched theatrically, I will specify in various paragraphs, what I didn't like about the movie. When I went to watch the movie, I didn't thought it would be a classic. But boy if I knew how bad it was/is I wouldn't bothered to go in at all.Let's start from the actors. And if I didn't knew the actors I'd be wondering where they had found those people (maybe they dragged someone in from the street?). But there is an explanation: Sam Neill & Co are humans too and they need the money. To pay bills and stuff. But even they must be ashamed of this. And they didn't even bother to act at all! Not that it would have elevated this movie to much better ranking place, but it might have been a little more pleasant to watch. Or at least they could have tried to have while shooting the movie, but even that wasn't possible (it seems that way if you watch the movie).But the actors are not the ones responsible for this mess. First of all you have to ask yourself if the scriptwriter had anything in mind except 'a cool idea'! Because the outline did sound quite good. But when you have so much plot holes in a movie ... you just wish it is over. For the movie and the characters! You just don't care for people who act irrational and only just about compete who'll say the worst line in the movie. Irrational 'acting' is something that you are used to in horror movies (most of the thrill will happen, just because of that behavior), but what happens here is just about every bad cliché thrown in. And mixed together, they don't taste any good, and they also smell bad too! But a bad script can be helped by a good director. If there was one here at hand ... If if if ... but there was none. Quite the contrary, this one (director was meant) isn't good, but he's bad! So he let all of the above happen and more. When people have a bad thing happening and then just jump out the next moment as if nothing happened, you're not only confused, but more than a bit angry. Mass delusion anyone? It must've been something in the tea or coffee!Talking about something, like you don't believe it exists, just to be afraid of the same thing that doesn't 'exist' the next second ... at least that's what the script lines were that came out the actors mouth ... (you didn't get it? Neither did I while watching the movie!) It's just so f**'d up ... I get mad thinking about it ... The movie touched a nerve. And one things for sure, if I ever do something bad again, something real bad, I shall be punished with watching this movie along 'Kinetta' ... But if you're a masochist, you can do that in your free time too ... I warned you! But if you don't want to waste your time, just don't watch this 'classic'! (and yes I knew that some people will be offended by this, those same people who think this movie is good. Can't believe it, but some people just seem to enjoy the formula bad acting/bad director/bad script ... knock yourself out!)",1,5,12,23 April 2006
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Dark Thriller
","While I haven't read the books/novels, I enjoyed the movie very much. Even if it's only part 1 of the trilogy, it still feels like a movie that has a beginning and an ending. I can't say how that works in the books, but the translation to the screen seems really good (voting here underlines that).While thrillers are mostly considered TV material and this one might borderline on that fine edge, it still deserves to be seen on the big screen. The actors (mostly unrecognizable to the worldwide audience) are really good. The editing and pacing is great and it's really a great suspense movie. A little thriller that dares to go to dark places.",8,91,129,25 October 2009
Big Hero 6," Disney back on track
","I was really surprised when 'How to Train ... 2' won the Golden Globe ahead of 'Big Hero 6'. Not because the former is a bad movie, but because this one was so good. The Oscars for once got it right this time though. They awarded it rightfully. Why? Because while it might start off slowly, it does pick up. And through all the clichés we are used to (and have watched before), this is a good movie for the young ones, but also for adults.There is humor for both age groups (if you only say young and old as I just did). The scene with the low power works on so many levels, that I almost fell off my chair laughing. Of course you could say, that it was silly, but you have to let yourself go at times and laugh a little bit. Especially if a movie is able to reach out and spark some emotions. And this movie is able to do just that.There is a short movie that should be on any disc version as well, that is good to set the mood. Watch it and have fun",9,3,7,11 June 2015
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Siege
","While the setting could remind many of the old Western movies, it does pack quite a bit of action in here. And therefor makes it more straightforward then the first movie. It also is picking up where the first one left us off. So it does make sense, to watch the first Resident Evil movie. You do not have to have played the games though. Though there are characters in here, that you might have seen or heard of, if you did, it also offers things, that have not been handled in the game series at all! Milla is joined by some other people and we do have a 'funny man' in here too. So there is some comic relief after all (if that was the one thing, you were missing in the first movie). On the other hand, it is far more lighter, because of the absence of any real story. You'll either think this is a good thing or not, but it is the way it is.",5,2,3,30 December 2010
Dumb and Dumber," Gross, quirky and weird
","Now how does that sound? And I may not even have gotten all of the 'bad' things one can say about this movie. But it is also hillarious and super funny! Which is a testament to the two main actors, who are actually anything close to not being intelligent! And both relish in their roles respectively. The sequel that came years later (the official one, not the prequel one) was funny too, but showed that you can't catch lightning in a bottle. I think that's the saying, right? Maybe not, but whatever the case is, this is a classic.Of course as with all comedies it is in the eye of the beholder. Some things here can be seen as annoying or unfunny (as the bird joke shows, which also is quite mean to say the least). I rewatched this recently and it holds up, if you let it just work its magic. Don't think too much, just enjoy the many memorable scenes and some of the quotes ... and how the movie perfectly ends ... the way it kind of began",9,0,0,1 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," More wars
","But some only cared about the new 'species' that got introduced here. But worry not, they are not the new Ewoks. No the Porgs may be displayed a lot in this movie, but they still are just there to have a new toy to seel. If you think this is cynical, you are very gullible. You think anything being made for a big budget movie is not being slated for mass production? Of course kids need toys, so you could try to see it as a win/win.But back to the story that goes on from Episode 7. Recurring characters, and different chapters were everyone involved has something to do. I guess you could compare it to a fellowship but without a ring that has to be retrieved. They still have a goal, whether it's the good guys or the bad guys. It is what it is though and it never was about characters being depicted much - it's about the action, it's about the fantasy, it's about the road to self discovery ... and ultimately good versus evil",6,5,25,24 March 2018
Brave," Fairy tale
","Right up front you should know before you watch this: It's not 'How to train your Dragon'. In other words it's not as much a comedy as it is a fairy tale. I think the trailer was clear on that, but quite a lot of people seem to have been expecting different. Plus jokes do not equal story! I do understand if that is something that bothers people with the movie (like a friend of mine who told me, that he liked the Dragon movie better).Having said that, this still has comedy elements in it and you will laugh. But as with all the Pixar movies, they are concerned about the story. And while this sort of fairy tale has been told quite a few times, they still find fresh ways to tell the story. Which is quite simply amazing. The 3-D might not be that amazing, though you shouldn't take your glasses off halfway through the movie and then take it out on the movie (or the filmmakers for that matter).The voices are really good (some real Scottish talent at work including the one and only Craig Ferguson) and I loved the animation. Pixar itself can be called 'brave' for not only tackling the fairy tale this way, but going female lead on us. And again they made it work ...",9,5,9,17 September 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," This is really Groot!
","Obviously as the ratings show the general consensus is that this is a good movie. But even so, this will not be everyones cup of tea. Some will not even be into the Star-Lord (or is written as one word?). When you have Bradley Cooper, but have him only in a talking role (he's the raccoon), then it shows you have real faith in the material. Actually the director of Slither shows off he can handle bigger stuff.There is a lot going for the movie (be it the cast, might be the best movie Bautista has done and will be in for a while) and if you love Science Fiction, this might not have sounded like a shoo-in, I myself never thought I'd like this movie so much. But how could I think Marvel could go wrong? I don't know, but of course they didn't. They choose their directors wisely and their cast wisely too. Chris Pratt is someone you might have seen in many comedies before, all with small budgets or him in a supporting role (as in Delivery Man, a remake of a french movie with Vince Vaughn being top billed) .. things are about to be changed! People will know his name (his real one ... maybe also Star-Lord).There are so many little jokes in here, that it's not possible to list them all. On another note: As with every Marvel movie there is a stinger (scene) at the end of the movie, involving a character I never expected to see. A real treat, even though I have no clue if this is foreshadowing or just a joke. Whatever the case, sit through it and watch! :o)",10,8,18,27 October 2014
Evil Dead," It's evil and it's dead
","I do understand that some people are angry with this movie for various reasons. People are eager for the Evil Dead series to continue, so while there was always talk of that happening (right now there is an entry for Army of Darkness 2 for a 2016 release), a remake came first. A remake that the director didn't want Bruce Campbell to be associated with, so he could do his own thing. Something some fans surely didn't appreciate either of course.But cutting ties does make sense in this case. And while I'm a big fan of Bruce Campbell and would have loved to see him in here somewhere, I do respect the directors choice of not wanting that to happen. There is also the fact, that the movie tries to be as serious as possible. So it's more like the first Evil Dead than the movies that came after it. And it sort of works too, if you let yourself into it. Is there one particular character that is more than annoying and does things you could/should kill him for? Yes, but judging the whole movie just on that premise would be unfair to it and wouldn't help your viewing experience. Whatever the case, the movie has good effects, it's nicely told and acted too. Try to be open minded (not literally)",6,7,12,29 August 2013
The Imitation Game," Games people play ....
","My summary line might be a bit out of touch, but it was the first thing that came to my mind and I just put it there. The movie itself is anything but light (you won't be able to find too many funny moments in this, though the direct and dry responses by Benedicts 'character' do help with that a lot), telling a true story, about someone who had to overcome a lot of obstacles.It might be easy for those who know the real person or to others who observed better than me, to see one of the biggest dilemmas of our central character is. There are a lot of course (not being able to take no for an answer, unable to work in a team and so forth), but I'm talking specifically ... and a thing he might not be able to 'work' on, even if some try to make you believe there is always 'a choice'. Putting this all into the mix, might feel too much for some, or not nearly enough to create real tension. But the movie is very well made personal journey through a difficult time ...",8,0,0,22 June 2015
The Evil Dead," Last house in the woods
","If you look at the budget Sam Raimi had to make this, it is incredible what the end result it. Of course having a good friend with the name of Bruce Campbell always helps. That's some value right there for almost no money at all. But Sam puts Bruce in every one of his movies, so I'm pretty sure he made up for the thin salary on this one. On the other hand, Sam likes to put Bruce through some ordeals and this movie is not different in that approach.The movie though is straight horror. The sequels became much lighter in tone (especially the third one). It's also one of the movies that hasn't been released completely uncut in Germany! I won't spoil anything, when I say the two key scenes that are missing involve a pencil and a tree! If you've seen the movie, you know those scenes are pretty horrific and make the movie what it is too. Make up is great and the camera on the water device Sam came up with is just one of his technical ingenuities!",7,0,3,29 August 2013
8 Mile," Eminem Confidential
","While everyone was and is stating that this movie is not a biography of Eminem, his transition into movies, wasn't to difficult. Playing a rapper while being one 'in real life' that is. What really surprised a lot of people, was the director. The man responsible for L.A. Confidential would direct a movie about a rapper? Has rap gone mainstream enough for that to happen? Or couldn't he find anything else suitable to direct? While the underdog story works quite fine and Eminem justifies being chosen to star in this movie, you can see where it all will lead. Like a sports movie sort of. Still the ending is pretty good and leaves you with a good feeling, of having watched a movie about music, that conveys also in the drama department.",6,0,0,21 July 2009
Shrek 2," Another one
","It's almost a shame to write this, but it seems Eddie Murphy's best movies in recent history are animated (so you're not even seeing his face). Some say the same about Mike Myers, but one thing is for sure: After the second part was good, they did follow with part 3 which was really weak (more about that when I write a comment and rate Shrek part 3)! This movie continues the story, where we left off after Shrek ended. With a few nice touches and quite a few jokes, this really works because of the character interactions and one major new player: Antonio Banderas 'Cat'. The cat got so popular, that it will get it's own spin-off. If you liked part 1 then, go ahead and watch this one too",7,0,1,21 July 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 0,5
","Let's start from the actors. We have Uma Thurman (a great role for her to display her 'power'), we have the recently deceased David Carradine getting a chance to shine one more time. Than we have Michael Madsen, who only seems to really act, when Tarantino directs him (yes there is the small role in Thelma & Louise, but apart from that?). We have Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah and Vivica A. Fox. Great women, that Tarantino let's loose in this movie. Chiaki Kuriyama (of Battle Royale fame) and Sonny Chiba round up a pretty great cast.This first chapter of Kill Bill (which originally was planned as one long movie, but was split up into two) leaves you with quite a few questions. One of them being, what is the name of the main character. It seems to be a big mystery and there was a big fuss about it. We only find out in part 2 if it really was worth it.Jumping a few times in the time-line (past/present), we get a back story and why Uma is doing what she's doing. Still the promised long cut (Vol. 1 and 2 put together as one movie), is still absent and might never see the light of day. It's a shame, because quite a few things were promised. But then again, the 'Grindhouse' experience hasn't hit home cinemas either ... we'll keep on waiting then ...",7,1,4,21 July 2009
Saw II," Look here 'now'
","It's not necessary to have seen the first saw to enjoy this movie, but it always helps. You would be familiar with the concept of the movie and get into the movie quicker. If you haven't seen SAW, then you'll be in for a surprise. Especially as they did up the ante (the gore section of it in particular).This one is as the rest of the franchise, not for the faint-hearted! It's not subtle, it's in your face. And although one could argue that there is not a big deal of plot here, it is about other things (like the tension it builds up). If you like your gory movies delivered with tension and a big thrill element, than you can't go wrong with this one!",8,0,1,24 February 2008
Ip Man," Famous
","(Y)ip Man is a guy you might not know of, although if you are into Martial Arts, you should know who he is/was. It's not that important for the movie that you do, the information will be revealed for all at the end of the movie, when you hear/read about the real life Ip Man. Considering his impact on the Martial Arts scene, I guess he couldn't have been portrayed by anyone else then Donnie Yen (at this particular time that is).Still the movie leaves you with a feeling that there could have been more and what do you know? There is a second movie coming (although I'm not sure when that is supposed to be playing time line wise). Maybe when the second movie is released, it will make this one look a bit better too. We'll see. A good movie, a great performance, but we have to wait for a few other goodies as it seems.",7,2,4,19 November 2009
Here Comes the Boom," And the Boom is gone
","I have to admit, that I was more than surprised by this movie. I never thought I'd actually would think of it as funny. Or laugh a couple of times for that matter. While Salma Hayek has not much to do (other than look good and have a few other scenes), Kevin James does the heavy lifting (no pun intended). While he re-unites with his brother in this one (also known from the hit TV show), he actually feels like a real human being (his character that is).There are some sub-stories that do not make that much sense, but other than that, the movie is clearly well edited and written (for its purpose that is). The underdog might take a few punches, but you do know where it is all leading. Still you can watch it and be entertained and that's all that matters (action does look good too, which is very important with a movie like this of course)",6,2,2,1 July 2013
Clash of the Titans," Why so serious?
","It was one of the main goals and one of the main distinctions to the Original from the 80s, that this movie tried to be more earnest and not as camp as the other Clash. Why they choose to 'update' and make it 3-D, when it wasn't supposed to be (and never really looks any good in 3-D), that's another question.If you didn't like the original, you might be in for a treat, because Sam Worthington does play it as straight as possible. But was it necessary to do that? I don't think so. The comic relief characters in this almost never works and the level of seriousness reaches a point where it get ridiculous (to me).The CG looks good, the fight scenes are nice too and everyone tries their best. But it would have been a lot better if it knew what it is, instead of trying to be more dramatic than the story can handle. Inconstincies and plot holes, a short journey and some sudden mood changes are the final nails in the coffin.",3,1,4,4 October 2010
Jurassic World," Jurassic Park ... I mean World reloaded
","So they needed how many years to work on that script? But at least the effect people had more to work with, so this is the best looking Jurassic Park movie yet (does it matter if it's called World? Most people will say they watched Jurassic Park, which is just the truth). So while we get a remix version of the first movie with some enhancements (Dinosaur and people-wise), this can be fun to watch.So why 'just' 6/10? You get Chris Pratt in this, who 'killed' it (not literally of course), but even if he has some real 'suave' (scenes), he can't lift this higher than it can get. Visually stunning with some very nice action scenes indeed. Of course there is sequel material to this reboot. And it's as predictable as it gets. Dinosaurs are back (again) and they never looked better (or more 'evolved') ... a bit more brain would have been nice though",6,9,22,11 July 2015
Paranormal Activity," Flavor of the week
","Or year, whatever suits you best. One thing is for sure though: This thing gets hyped as 'Blair Witch' was hyped when that came out. While Blair Witch had a clever marketing campaign (or not, if you think people shouldn't have believed it to be a true story), this one grows by word of mouth.While it really is original and stands out for that, that is no reason to give it high points just like that. Apart from the fact, that nothing much happens in this movie (which would be fine in general, but combined with weak characters/actors is a very dangerous unhealthy mix), it also fails to be gripping most of the times. While Japanese movies have walked that way since the 90s, it seems the western world just realises that the 'real' world can be real scary.Well it would be, because seeing situations that could happen in your home or maybe have even happened in similar fashion, might make you feel weird and uncomfortable. Having said that, it would have been great to have stronger performances and characters. Especially the male lead is not only annoying, but just plain stupid. It's common that people in horror movies behave strange and do things they shouldn't do. But this guy beats them all in just one movie. There is doing something stupid and then there is suicidal. Well this guy is suicidal.Not only that, he's acting strong in one scene, just to break down in another (similar) one. There is no consistency to it at all. There was no actual sense of fear for me, because I just couldn't care less. The only time I was really scared, was when (almost at the end of the movie) something scary happened. And I wasn't scared because what happened on screen, but because a few girls were screaming right next to me! I almost had a heart attack because of those screamers! Talking about the ending: There was an original ending (the movie actually was ready to go in 2007), but was deemed not scary enough! So they shot the ending that can be seen now in cinemas. If rumors are true than Mr. Spielberg himself suggested the filmmakers should re-shoot the ending.I didn't even go into other flaws (story/script/editing), especially the latter, because it's a general problem with all those movies that are being shot 'for real'. Who does edit them? Romero found a nice solution to that, which is integrated into the Diary of the Dead and REC/Quarantine is too powerful for you to notice. With the slow moving pace of this, you will be reminded painfully every other second ...",3,6,10,21 November 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Nice kids movie
","First off, I have to admit, that I haven't seen the original Charlie & the Chocolate movie. So I won't be able to compare the movies with each other. But I can tell you that this is a nice little kids movie, that you've got here. Johnny Depp, a Tim Burton regular, plays his role with much gusto.But the kids are great, too. Not to mention the squirrels or Charlie's helpers, who are also great. But it's all too neat and as an adult and/or as a frequent movie goer, you'll know where this is going. No surprise there, but still plenty of fun to be had, if you let the movie have an effect on you. Also noteworthy, Burtons wife is also in this movie, as in his other efforts, too and the really great Christopher Lee has a small, but significant role to play here too!",7,0,1,7 July 2007
Mission: Impossible II," Make up your own mind
","I know that most people don't like this installment in the MI franchise. Either they are (John) Woo Fans and say he was pushed around by Tom Cruise (which he might have been, I wasn't there so I don't know). Mission Impossible fans (most from part 1) who say there is not enough story here.Let me straighten it out, the way I see it. Yes it is not the best John Woo movie ever. His trademarks are still there (maybe even (en)forced by Tom Cruise, who is also a producer here, besides the fact that he has the lead role). Yes there is not much plot/story ... you could even say none at all. Still I found it better than making one up (such as the BS from part 1). And it makes the whole film more 'believable'. More believable in the sense that you know, you are in a 'world' that isn't real! So scenes like the motorcycle duel can happen won't bother you or take you out of the movie.Yes there are things, that still are bothering even me (7 out of 10 isn't a perfect grade). For once the scene, where Thandie Newton and Tom are in their cars and are spinning around in slow motion. There are people who really hate this scene. I'm just gonna say that it is to long! Main themes that Woo used in his HK-days are missing too.It is something you should expect when watching this. I liked it, but then again, that's me ... normally when you read this with the spoiler warning, it means you've made up your mind. I'm not here to change that ... I'm just stating my opinion! :o)",7,0,0,4 April 2007
The Adjustment Bureau," Tip of the hat
","You could either cherish the good things the movie has to offer (light sci-fi, enjoyable thrills, actors with chemistry and the romantic theme) or you could bash it for its downfalls (not that deep, plot holes, maybe even inconsistencies in the story). It's up to you. As you can see, I rated it high. Why? Because I was entertained and that weighed more for me than any of the weak points the movie had.Still even President Obama had a stab at the movie (after he heard that Matt Damon was disappointed in his presidential efforts, Obama stated in one of his speeches, that he could say the same about Damon, mentioning the Adjustment Bureau). Still the source material is strong enough to justify at least one viewing :o)",8,3,4,18 December 2011
World Trade Center," This is what happened ...
","... and it's shown quite literally here on this film. So you get more a documentary kind of vibe of it. Although it's shot as a movie as opposed to 'United 93' that had the documentary vibe all over it, you get a retelling of what happened on that day (9/11), at the site of the twin towers! This is then the story of firemen and their families. Who both are helpless (in more than one way) to the horrific thing that happened that day! It's nice that as with 'United 93', Oliver Stone asked the families for permission, too. He got many details from those conversations and that shows on screen! This movie is character driven, but not in the sense that the main leading characters are actively involved in a journey, which is something a viewer might want to see (there's a character who takes that active role, but it merely seems enough) ... Still gripping from start to finish, especially if you don't know what happened exactly ...",7,1,3,6 May 2007
The Hangover Part II," Same mayhem, different city
","Of course the premise is more or less the same. But it's not like all the jokes that were funny in the first Hangover get repeated here. It's in the same style and if you didn't like the first one (yes indeed there are quite a few who didn't enjoy the first Hangover), then you will not like this one either.Since you've seen something like this before there is however a possibility that you feel this is a letdown. It wouldn't be fair to the movie to just judge it by its predecessor. Different animal 'craziness' can result for you to either like that or hate it (had a conversation about the new animal depicted here with another person and she didn't like it a bit).Again, don't come looking for a different plot (or something that will distinguish it completely from the first Hangover), but only come in to watch this as an enhancement, another take on the Hangover theme, if you will. And it is to be expected that there will be more ... Just wondering what city they'll choose next ...",7,0,0,4 January 2012
Prisoners," More than just one meaning
","If you think of someone being a prisoner, you automatically might think of someone behind bars. But apart from a physical prison, a prisoner can also be trapped mentally, either by his own doing or by someone else. This movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. And it is carried by its actors. Gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning, even like a cardboard cutout. But he does have more to do as the movie progresses.Still front row seat is Hugh Jackman. And while some might argue that a female should have a bigger role in this, you only have so much time to tell a story. And this is perfectly told and cut together. It might not fit your description of entertainment (and I don't think the filmmaker would love it described as such), but the movie is really great. If you like dramas in general you should be cherishing this .... and you will.We have a few grey areas that we visit and the ending did not satisfy everyone (I know from friends). But the movie could not have ended any other way (in my book). Superb movie one of the best released in 2013",10,86,102,2 June 2014
Silence," Religious much?
","The premise is that Christians had it really tough in Japan. They were hunted, they were punished unless they became faithless. In a way this is what Rome did way back in the day, when they were trying to suppress Christianity. Of course we cannot forget that Christianity also tried to force themselves and their believe on others, while invading countries for quite some time.So everything relating to punish people because of religion, I'd say not really a good thing. Whether it be of what you believe (or don't) or what you want others to believe. This journey is really a tough one though and as others already have stated here, this is not an entertaining movie. It also brings home the message way before the movie ends. In other words, it may have done with a shorter running time.Having written all that, I can also say as many have before me, that this is technically brilliant. The actors also doing a great job, Scorsese going back to one of his favorite themes. While Bringing out the Dead was not successful and had its issues too, this sees an expected evolution to the theme. Tough and long watch then, are you up for it? Will this be something you want to see?",6,0,2,22 July 2017
Logan," Re-tiring
","The Wolverine movies did not have much luck. While we got used to Hugh Jackman and his performance will be burned in our heads, the stand-alone movies never really stood out that much. Well that is until Logan came along. And Logan has another member of the X-Men family in it, portrayed by Patrick Stewart in this case. And while Logan/Wolverine does not age, both are retired.A broken down Logan takes care of his former mentor and Professor at the Mutants Academy/school. Especially the Professor has lost a lot of his power (no pun intended). Those two are forced (you could have guessed that even without seeing the trailer) to go on one last road trip. And they have to because of a young girl. And while Logan seems not to care, circumstances do not leave him much choice.There are battles, there is drama and it is one of the best X-Men movies that has been made. There is also a lot of violence. This may be a comic book adaptation, but it certainly does not shy away from the brutality of its source. And this rawness helps it elevate, helps it become even more emotional, in more than one instance. Set in the future this is a good movie to end the Wolverine .... Trilogy",8,6,11,15 July 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The bar is set high
","And therefor it's not as surprising to see/hear people being disappointed in the outcome. But the movie itself is more than decent, if you watch it free of any comparisons. And I don't mean free as in not connected (Guardians of the Galaxy can be seen as that), but as in not comparing it in scale or humor to the other entries in the franchise. Phase 3 is a go after this.Since I'm not that familiar with the comics themselves I cannot compare nor am I 'biased' or preoccupied/preconceived by anything. So characters coming up and the interpretation of them are fresh as they are presented. It might take the 'easy' way out in some cases, but overall the odds are against stacked against our heroes.Apart from building up on the previous build ups and Hawkeye/Widow getting more screen time, what I do like, is the fact that you get little jokes throughout the movie. The 'language' joke might annoy some, but I like little gems like that myself. Obviously some people are fed up with Superhero movies, but that won't change the fact, that they are here to stay ... and entertain if you let them",8,1,6,7 July 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Sucking the blood out of animated movies?
","Not really. But not giving it new life either! Now that we have cleared the puns (you may come up with some of your own, if you like), let's get to the meat of things ... Alright almost cleared. But while I do have fun writing the review, I wish I had more fun watching the actual movie. Now I know this is meant to appeal to children (though there are a few scenes, that are borderline to say the least, if shown to the little ones), but that doesn't mean it has to be stupid. Pixar set a high standard of course, but other studios have followed and there have been quite a few entertaining fun animated movies.While this isn't DOA (or undead to stay with the theme), it clearly lacks heart. This pun was not planned, but it is in tune with the jokes of the movie. Most seem not planned and just ridiculous. Does that mean you won't have fun watching this? No, you might even have more fun with this than I had with ParaNorman (a far superior movie, though not perfect either). As the rating shows on IMDb, many loved the movie and I hope you do too. I'm just telling you to not raise the stake here ...",5,3,4,9 May 2013
Hotel Mumbai," Quite the mess

The movie is quite exhilareting and quite draining to watch. Not easy and most definitely not for the faint of hearted.Why certain things happen is tough to answer and the movie is not going into much detail about the culprits. It concentrates more on the 'victims'. What a powerhouse performance by the way for our main character. Tough but quite essential if you like dramas",9,3,19,21 February 2020
The Dark Knight," Watch the IMAX version if you can
","I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan 'Biggest screen in the UK'), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.The movie could also have been called 'The Joker', but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And 'The Dark Knight' is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!",10,4,11,14 September 2008
Everest," E as in Experience
","I'm not a (mountain) climber myself, but the way this movie is shot really takes you right into the heart of it all. Even if I didn't see it in IMAX 3D, I did see it on the (smaller) big screen nonetheless and it did add to the whole watching experience. It's also nice to have strong actors in this, who convincingly portray their characters (haven't seen any background or behind the scenes stuff yet, so can't talk about the amount of 'fake'/greenscreen used).Having said that, this is not for the fainthearted. It takes a lot out of people to climb a mountain, even more so if it's a really big one like Everest. And the (weather) conditions are beyond what anyone can imagine, even just talking about them. So from the safety of your home or theater or wherever you're watching this, you can go on a trip that while still will is able to drain you, it will leave you satisfied and suspenseful until the end",8,0,1,6 September 2016
Friends with Benefits," It could have been so good
","While the movie is aware of the clichés that are thrown into the mix when making (or watching) a romantic comedy and they also play with them at the beginning (with a kind of harsh comment concerning a Miss Heigl), it does fall back on the same 'mistakes' it criticizes. And while it does so with a wink (and a great 'number' towards the end, which in itself is a great payoff), it does feel a bit like a cheat. The movie should have stuck to its guns.But with Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake it has a great cast, that almost make you forget about those little mishaps. Even a sub-story with Richard Jenkins though, feels a bit forced. There are quite a few funny moments and there is no doubt where this will lead, but it could have been a real good stab at romantic comedies. As it is, it's just another one of them ...",6,0,1,5 March 2012
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Patience
","Are you into Golf? How exciting is the game for you? Now I would not say that I am a fan of the game itself. As in I don't really watch the tournaments and I don't play it myself. Having said that, the way the movie portrays and shoots and displays everything is quite exceptional.So you get sucked into this world, but of course it is more than that. It is real life and it is people that existed and things that happened (more or less, creative freedom and all that). Good actors elevate it and it does feel like a Disney kids movie to a degree. Which I don't say with any bad sentiment, rather the opposite, as in quality wise. Still we know how these movies work and unless you are under a certain age, you will probably not be too surprised or enamoured by it. Good movie, nothing more, nothing less",7,0,0,13 July 2019
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Potter actually
","This part 5 of a septology (if that is indeed a word and means series of seven or something like that). You couldn't tell by it's title (at least I couldn't), if you're not an avid reader of the books. Which I'm certainly not (guilty as charged, for not having read any of the Potter books).This one continues the story from the previous movies, also having a short intro in the 'real' (human?) world (as the other installments had, always in the beginning). This one does have some powerful theme running throughout and yes Harry Potter begins to grow into adulthood (one would/could say). Still not breaking any family friendly rules overall, I'd say. It's a good movie and if you've watched the other four movies, you'll watch this one too (there's no doubt about it ... 3 more years and two more Potter movies to come)",7,0,0,10 October 2007
Into the Wild," Wild Deer
","We have a strange little movie here. The main character seems very mean at the beginning and does things most of the viewers/the 'civilised' world wouldn't dare to do. So is there even a chance for redemption to this character? While he doesn't really change in the course of the film (not in his overall believe), I think we find ourselves attracted to the idea of 'being free', taking choices and not having to ask anyone if you can or can't do this and that. But what it also ultimately shows us, is that humans do need company. Even those who barricade themselves in their rooms and think they're better off alone ... aren't. There's always someone near you (not really tough, when you consider the world population), so that might drive (some of) us, into wanting to be alone, but ultimately that wish will never happen and maybe deep inside those people know it and that gives them comfort, while they think they are alone. That is what this is about (as I understood it) :o)PS: Hirsch (the main actors real last name) means deer in German, just in case you wondered!",9,1,3,9 July 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Genius
","I won't go so much into the plot or try to answer questions that you might have about the movie or what it's about. This is something you have to figure out yourself (and it will be difficult) or search for some explanation on the internet. Although I don't think there is a definitive one! It's a lot of guessing, but not so much knowing what Kubrick was saying.But what I want to talk about, is how the movie was made. Everything is genius, from the fact, that there is no noise in space (and there isn't despite almost every other movie telling you there is, e.g. see Star Wars), to the making of some shots. A shot where it seems the camera is spinning around, it's actually the set that is build like a 'spinning wheel', the camera is set in one position. But my favorite piece is the sound design! I can't compliment the movie enough on this matter! When the astronaut is breathing in one scene, I suddenly realized, that my breathing was controlled by him. My breathing was identical to the rhythmic sound of the movie. And I don't believe this was an accident, this was Kubricks genius. Of course if you watch it for the first time, you might not realize that, but if you focus on it, you will see that you breathe in the same way as the man on screen! Enough said!",8,1,6,9 July 2007
Toy Story," Playmates
","The original meaning of a playmate that is of course. Pixar is inventive, Pixar does great movies. Well, you've heard and hopefully have seen it before. But if you have not watched a movie by Pixar yet, you are in for a treat.You don't have to be a kid to enjoy the movies they do. But they work as family movies, kids movies or just 'plain' movies. It is only a matter of time until Pixar will win an Oscar. Not for animated picture (they've done that and will be doing it for many years to come), but for Best Picture (period)! Toy Story is a ... well story-fantasy that many kids have while they grow up. And to see that come to life (no pun intended), is just great. Especially because Pixar equally has treats for kids and grown-ups alike. You'd have to be a cynic to not like it, I guess. But if you do not have an aversion against animated pictures, you have to check this one out",9,0,0,21 October 2010
Blood Diamond," Great Performances
","Whoever still says that Leonardo Di Caprio can't act, must be out of her/his/their mind! Or they're jealous or whatever, but even if I'm not a Leo Fan, I've got to give him credit. He plays his role really great (with dialect and all). Of course you also got J. Connely and D. Hounsou. And some bit players of course. Everyone is great in the movie and if I'm not mistaken the main actor from Tsotsi has a cameo. Although it's a brief appearance it's memorable! (imdb data bank doesn't confirm this, so I can't be sure, but I could swear it was him) :o) The storytelling of the movie is great too. The adventure, the up and downs, everything fits. What's a little disappointing and was the reason why I didn't give this movie 10/10, is that there was something missing to make that movie really great. Can't explain it, but maybe it was a little bit the fact that the movie tried to be to political. The ending was another point for me, where it could've been better. But those are minor things and overall it's a really great movie.It's good to see Ed Zwick back (he didn't disappear, but didn't make great/memorable movies either, The Siege anyone?) after Glory, nearly 20 years ago! Hopefully it won't take him that long to make another great movie! :o)",8,2,4,30 January 2007
War Machine," War ... what is it good for?
","Well if you know the song I'm referring, you know the answer. But setting that aside (and also acknowledging that it doesn't apply for all wars obviously), this movie is about 'modern war' or rather USA 'helping' other countries to rebuild their country. Now most do know that those attempts backfired ... and they backfired badly.Many countries started hating America because of that interference and the Americans going over there don't know why they are there and what they are supposed to do. Millitary personnel who has to wing it, but also plan ahead and stay put, but also be active. All things that do contradict each other. And while that seems to have a lot that a movie can exploit, watching it you can't help yourself but think, this would have been better served as a sketch or a short movie. While it still boasts a lot of star power (Brad Pitt is the lead but many more show up), the running time of 2 hours plus is way too long. The point it is trying to make is worthwhile ... the time you have to spent watching the point being made repeatedly might be wasted to an extent.",6,1,2,8 February 2018
Men in Black," Here come the Men in Black
","The Galaxy Defenders in their very first mission (or is it? With prequels and such you never know really). The movie on hand though does work very well (even the little CGI that was used held up quite good I'd say), which is the achievement (especially) by the actors! Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work perfectly together. The stern almost emotionless Tommy (aka K) and the energetic J, who's all over the place. That formula works like magic.Of course there is other things that make this fun, like the 'aliens' that live among us for years. You might recognize one or two of them. Some are in the background some are shown very openly. A good mix of Sci-Fi, Action and Comedy.",7,1,2,16 July 2012
Pride & Prejudice," Mr. Sutherland spoils us ..
","I wouldn't say that Donald Sutherland is my favorite actor. What he shows here though, although very good, does spoil the movie. Why you ask? Because whenever he's on screen, you get the feeling, what real acting is like! He could've centred the movie, but he's shown to little in it, to help it (this was of course on purpose, to elevate his performance, when he's on screen), on the contrary he's spoiling it!The other actors (most of them younger) are good or rather can be good, and they showed it in other movies (I'm sure), but not here. But that's not all, the back and forth on many subjects on display here and the direction of the movie (which I don't really see getting anywhere, without taking too many detours), destroy all the romance that could've been there (or indeed was there for a little while). I never believed in any of the emotions the characters where trying to convince us they had (except Sutherland). And if I don't believe them, then there's no movie that I could like more better!",5,1,5,9 July 2007
Puss in Boots," Entertaining and by the numbers
","I enjoyed the movie and I thought it was a really nice comedy. Having seen the trailer though, there was almost nothing left to laugh about. Most jokes are in there. Which of course can be said about most comedies and you wonder why the have to put all the jokes in there? Are they afraid no one will go into the theatre? Whatever the case may be, the movie is entertaining enough.But is it Oscar-material? I don't think so! In a year, where Pixar only had Cars 2 to offer, none of the rivals seemed to really catch the opportunity. And the one movie that actually should have been the winner wasn't even nominated (see 'Tin Tin' the Spielberg movie). People would argue it was motion captured, but they still had to animate that and the backgrounds and everything else.Back to Puss in Boots, which sees Banderas reprising his role, having good chemistry with Salma Hayek (nothing to wonder here) and Zach G. doing his comedy routine. Unfortunately the movie takes again the completely inapt way of unbelievable villain turning nice and good again. Most of the movies who try that, just aren't convincing enough, as is this. But kids won't mind and you will have fun for the running time.",6,1,1,23 March 2012
Elysium," Funny and bloody
","You might be surprised at first, why this movie was rated R, but after watching it, you won't be. I don't want to reduce it to that though. On the other hand, I have to talk about the different accents. While it is fairly easy to understand the Spanish flavored accent, many might have issues with the south African accent from the 'District 9' star. I myself count amongst them.Still you can't blame the movie trying to really have many religions and nationalities in it. It's also great seeing Jodie Foster in a different sort of role. Matt Damon is good as lead, though not every joke hits home. His action star status earned with Bourne gets a new refreshing Science Fiction update here though. His character tries to stay grey, though you will know where this is heading. Some I'm sure might feel troubled by the violence and moral issues though",7,0,2,3 October 2013
Taken," No compromises
","I have to start with a review of the movie, in a magazine (Empire), which gave this movie a real rating. The reason for that, was the fact, that the movie shows Europe in a dark light and if you would actually take the whole thing seriously, you could accuse the movie of being 'xenophobic' (or should that read 'euro-phobic'?) ... but that's missing the point.The movie is there to entertain and not to warn Americans, to stay in America and take their vacations there (which the review also stated). Entertain might seem a bit of a stretch if you have seen the movie, but I do stand by that. After a slow start, the pace picks up and there is almost no stop until the end.The movie is pretty intense, but it is completely justifiable. And it does stay true to itself, which makes it a lot better than recent efforts (Brave One, Death Sentence) in that same or similar fashion.",9,1,2,22 May 2009
Alice in Wonderland," (visually) Stunning
","I'm not that familiar with the books and I don't really recall the Disney classic, so forgive me for not comparing those to the movie at hand. Of course I do know the overall story and I have seen the Disney movie, but that was too long ago, to really claim to know the differences and/or advantages of either product.What I do know though, is that this movie works more as a sequel to the Disney film. Alice is older now, but can't remember what happened to her when she was younger. Actually she is thinking those (few) things (she does remember), were dreams. There is a character arc there, though it isn't a big one. It's not like she is going to change completely in the course of her journey. And story-wise there are quite a few holes.Still visually, this movie is fantastic. While it hops along with a nice pace and has a few things happening here and there. And while that might not be satisfying for most people, it is enough to entertain quite a few others. The question that remains to be answered is: Which group do you belong to?",7,0,1,9 September 2010
Avatar," Aliens
","Quite a lot has been said and written about this movie. It's a fact that it has broken all the records (except at the Oscars, which might have saved us a King of the World/Universe speech by Mr. Cameron), that it's loved by many, but despised by quite a lot also. While the story is not Original (it's not like there are that many Original stories lying around waiting to be made), the technical achievements have to be seen! Yes the story seems to be just another take on the Pocahontas story, but does that make the movie itself bad from the get go? I don't think so. After watching it a second time (at the theaters), I have to say, that there are quite a few nuances to the story, that are quite nice. Two lines from the beginning are kind of setting the tone, which you only realize when you watch it a second time.The 3-D Effects are great, but subtle and it was no surprise that they won at this years Academy Awards. While I still felt that the Navi 'people' didn't feel entirely realistic, it didn't feel wrong either. The graphics fitted into the whole Fantasy vibe the movie had going for it (at least that's how I felt, when I watched it). They weren't photo-realistic, but they were good enough.If you like a movie to be more low key, you should check 'Battle for Terra', an animated Feature, that has a similar overall story and came out prior to Avatar and therefor shouldn't be judged by a technical viewpoint/comparison to Avatar. That being said, I hope a future Blu Ray (DVD) Release of the movie will revolutionize the TV market and if we are lucky enough, the extended cut of the movie, might surface at the cinemas at/near the end of 2010. I'm looking forward to that, although I'm a bit skeptical about the love scene, that is apparently going to make it into that cut ...Edit: Looks like we have been 'lucky' enough ... though I would argue with that myself now. After having watched the movie for a third time (the last one being the extended cinema cut), I kinda began to dread the experience. It's just too much for me. Even on the IMAX screen in London and even while recognizing many (most?) of the new inserted scenes. And there is even a bigger cut out on DVD/Blu Ray. Though the 3-D version will not be released before 2011. I personally can't watch it again for another 2 years ... or else I would have to re-evaluate and cut off a point or two ...",8,4,9,24 March 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Forget the rating
","And by rating I mean the 'PG-13' one. Seems like you can get away with murder these days with a PG-13 rating ... Seriously though: While this was one detail that got discussed quite a bit, even before the movie came out, many 'fearing' (no pun intended) that Raimi had lost his touch and had gone 'soft' on them.Fear no more (or actually do so, while watching the movie), because he hasn't. This movie is showcase of what Raimi is capable of. Sure you might not like the movie for various reasons, but Raimi does know how to build tension (and torture his protagonists apparently ... ask Bruce 'Ash' Campbell and now the lovely A. Lohman) ... and serve as the good stuff. Disturbing images and a nice score, neatly edited and shot. One of the best Horror movies of 2009.Sometimes it didn't get the recognition it deserved, sometimes it did (it just won another prize the other day). Of course there are flaws. Mr Jeepers Creepers (Justin Long) himself, reduced to a bystander for example. But in the end, it delivers fully on what it promises ...",9,84,119,28 June 2010
Selma," We'll cross that bridge when we get there
","It may sound easy written, but it most definitely wasn't. The powerhouse performance by our lead (portraying MLK!) is something to be amazed by. But it's the whole story that is still gripping and even if you know the facts, will keep you at the edge of your seat. What makes this movie still important so many years later, is that while the divide is not as big as it was, there is still a lot to be done.Even the small things are important and even when you get beaten down, you have to stand up and fight for what you believe in. Not easy to do and this movie shows more sides to MLK than just what he tried to accomplish. But it doesn't steer away from what most will remember him for. I watched this around the same time I watched American Sniper (Clint Eastwood directed) and while the Sniper movie was gripping as well, I was moved more by Selma and the events I watched unfolding in this movie ...",9,0,1,26 June 2015
The Artist," The Art is ...
","For some this movie was the first glimpse of a man by the name of Dujardin. I had the pleasure of watching a few movies he starred in. Both comedies (especially the OSS 117 movies, very politically incorrect) and a drama/thriller. The faces he's making here, will come as no surprise to those who've already seen him before. They also know that he can act from those movies.Even though I try to have as little information as possible, before going into a movie (therefor making it a sort of sneak preview kind of experience), everyone knew this was a silent movie. But would it work? Could someone really pull this off in our day and age, where we cherish the dialogue? I can tell you that it does work. Though I am afraid of the subsequent 'Scary Movie' spoofs that will follow and try to mock this (and fail of course). Still back to this and its superb cast. Even though they are not talking you can see, if you look closely, that the words they are mouthing are English. Which makes sense having John Goodman in it, but is still quite intriguing, since it is silent after all ...",8,0,2,3 May 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," The End
","No I didn't check the spoiler, because I wrote the end in the summary line. I think most people are aware, that this is (finally) the last movie in the Twilight universe. What started out as a nice little teenage (girl) fantasy/wet dream, became one of the most annoying series out there. For different reasons people started to hate it. Some for its popularity with young (and older) girls. But some because it was just a bad soap, with some glitter (not only over Mr. Kristen Stewart, if they actually finally stay together, forever).This final fest, was actually more than just decent, not only because it had the prospect of ending it all. But that right there is just it and that is why I put the spoiler tag up, the end is as bad as anything Dallas did. You know the old, it was all a dream thing, works for TV (mostly), but it just shouldn't be used in movies.Apart from that bad move, you get the usual, sulking Kristen (we know she can do better than that), a vampire that is more irritating than making people yearn for him (and Robert can act too, just don't judge him on the merits of this movie alone). And a wolf that can't let go. Literally too, with a very creepy turn concerning Bellas child (we don't know yet, if he can act though).All in all, if you have watched/endured the others, what is one final piece? Almost two hours of your life, but you want to see how it ends (twice). So here we go ... Goodbye",4,3,5,28 June 2013

And while everything seems to fit here, you can't but wonder, if it only was a fluke? Are the Farrely Brothers any good or were they just lucky with one movie? Well let's leave this question open and grab a hold of this movie. Ben Stiller is top notch casted as the male leading role. His ability in physical and oral comedy, can't be matched by many. Cameron Diaz and Co. willing to go extra miles (especially the 'hair' scene is pretty memorable) for any joke. It get's as politically incorrect as it can be, without losing it's touch with the viewers. A great movie indeed, a shame the directors couldn't follow up to that success though ...",8,1,3,21 July 2009
Invictus," Scratching the surface
","It's almost a shame, that we only get to see such a short part of Mandelas life. Matt Damon never really convinced me either in his role (his accent seemed to fade away at times or get thicker). But it's of course Morgan Freeman and his role of a lifetime (leaving his 'Bruce Almighty' appearance aside that is).And Morgan plays it as good as it can get. There are really strong themes here and some very interesting points get touched. Well more scratched that is. Because we never dig deeper. And while it is impossible to really capture a human and all his facades into one film, it still leaves a bitter taste, when you don't know what exactly drove him to do some of the things he did. While I'm for not over-explaining things, it seems that the movie oversimplifies some things.It just feels that something is missing. Or maybe it is, that Clint spoiled us and we expect every movie to be a masterpiece. Whatever it is, this is definitely worth watching, though if you really are looking for some insight into Mandela, I guess there will be some books out who will be more helpful",6,0,1,8 September 2010
Mission: Impossible," No Story, unbelievable Action
","For a movie that claims to be based on reality there are too much things that don't work in reality! I will only point out the two major flaws of the movie in this respect: 1) Tom Cruise falling with a fast pace towards a sensitive alarm wired floor! Yes he doesn't touch the floor, but the movie made us believe that this alarm that is installed in the floor is very sensitive ... well if it was, why didn't it go off? The pressure of the wind alone that Cruise's falling caused, should have triggered it (and I won't consider the fact, that a normal human being would be sweating like a pig, especially hanging like that ... any drop on the floor would have been the end of this heist/scam or whatever you want to call it) 2) The helicopter scene. Even people who like the movie more than me, do agree that this is totally bananas! Not only the fact that the helicopter goes into the tunnel or they used bad CGI (by today standards even more so), but for the fact that it literally stopped right in front of Mr. Cruise ... Again for a movie that tries to be real, a big suspension of disbelief isn't working here ...And then of course you have the BS plot, that anyone who has seen more than three thrillers can smell 10 miles against the wind ... Seriously it's so obvious and plain that there really is no suspense (oh and the fish tank explosion in the restaurant? What was that all about? Whatever!) Still the movie is shot and edited in a very professional way (you shouldn't expect otherwise from De Palma, the director here). And it has some action highlights (just not those I mentioned before!)",5,1,4,4 April 2007
La La Land," Moonlighting Hollywood
","Having 2 jobs because you're not sure if you can succeed in the one you are actually interested in, is nothing out of the ordinary. And our two main characters in this, have issues with their dream. And sometimes they sing and dance about them. One of those moments is very early on, when stuck in traffic, suddenly everyone is joyously breaking out of their cars and start a dance number that does look like they actually trained for it ... All joking aside, you have to have a heart for this type of movie, otherwise this is nothing you will enjoy at all.Having said all that, there are different layers to this. The drama works quite fine and there is quite a few different interpretations of certain things that happen. It's all fun and games until certain decisions have to be made, that can be life altering. The leads are exceptional and you may have seen them before together on screen. Maybe that helped their chemistry, but what matters is that this works quite nicely",8,1,4,4 July 2017
Saw," They came, SAW and altered (Horror Movies)
","I haven't seen the original short movie yet (titles SAW as well), but with this feature length effort, a change has been made in Horror movie history. A new sub-genre was born (some call it 'gorno', because of the explicit gore it has in it)! Many movies tried to copy the formula, but didn't have financial success. Saw on the other hand, is a brand name now. A 5th saw movie will come out later this year (and more are yet to come).But let's talk about this original, that lays some seeds for the other movies to follow. We get the rules to which the character have to play (the general idea) or let's say the concept. It will keep you guessing from beginning to the end, what is going to happen. And although I like the other Saw movies as well, none of them achieved the tension that this one build up! Apart from the gore you'll get a thrilling experience as well! I can only recommend it (as many others do here too)",9,0,1,24 February 2008

Obviously the story did get a revamp and the interesting idea got worked out into a feature length. Which worked out very nice. And it's not only the cast that helps here, the director shows, that he is able to handle a bigger budget as well.There are some genuine creepy moments in this and Jessica Chastain has one major role to play even though she seems to be second fiddle (in more than on sense). There are many things in this movie that get touched upon and they do work nicely (parenthood, growing up, responsibilities and more). The director is one to look out for.",8,1,2,13 September 2013
Super 8," Abrams and Spielberg never say ... Goonies?
","Of course it would be unfair to compare it with Goonies (a true classic). Still the comparisons can be made. But it's only part of the fun. The movie is a mix of two ideas as Abrams has stated himself. He had his idea (kids filming with a Super 8 camera as homage) and mixed it with another idea he found. I won't say what for those who actually haven't heard about it and do not want to spoil their surprise.Having said that, the kid actors (Dakota Fannings sister is in it) are mostly newcomers, with about half of them making their debut in this very film. If you consider this, they are naturals and everyone is very good at what they're doing. Cinematography and effects are great. If you could fault something, it could be the unbalanced story. Is it for kids or maybe more for adults? Still this might be nit-picking, the fact is, that this is a great movie to enjoy",7,1,3,9 January 2012
Sinister," Who said critics can't write good movies?
","One of the things people keep saying, is that people who became critics (or are critics) didn't cut it in the (movie) business and therefor are bitter men. Men who are not able to deliver. I'm not familiar with the critics the filmmaker wrote, but one thing is for sure: He did make notes and obeyed them, which resulted in a pretty good movie.Of course Ethan Hawke playing the main character is helping a lot. But the dialog and the story as it moves forward is really good. There are still things you could argue might feel wrong or some smaller flaws in the story (that might not make too much sense under the microscope). Still a very good movie, with enough good solid scares, that actually makes sense overall. I'd call this a comeback after the terrible Keanu R. movie he made prior to this. Then again, he didn't write the script for that other movie ...",8,1,5,29 October 2012

Apart from Cars that is and even that movie is pretty good (and if you are a car lover, you might even think it's fantastic). But with 'Up' they made a story that is genuine and funny and just entertaining. And this years 'Best Animated Feature' winner is ... well you get the picture! I actually try to avoid any trailer from a movie that I might see (which pretty much is every movie out there, but that's a different story), but I couldn't avoid watching the Up trailer in cinemas. Frankly it didn't hurt my movie experience. The trailer doesn't reveal too much, which is really great. You have this old man, who lives in his house, minding his own business. Until one day ... well if you have seen the trailer you know, what is going to happen. And you will wait for it to happen. And when it happens, you won't be disappointed!

A Clockwork Orange," State of mind
","I tried to watch this a couple of years ago - I couldn't. I just couldn't, because what I saw in the first minutes was too much for me. Now while some say that the violence is so over the top and dated it does nothing anymore to the viewer nowadays, I have to strongly disagree. The interviews on the disc are quite nice and the audio commentary is revealing quite a few things, as is the very in-depth look into Malcolm McDowell (with Q&A and other stuff).So after 10-15 minutes I had to stop - and everyone kept telling me, that there would be some redemption for all that mayhem. And in a way they were right - though also wrong. Especially considering the real ending to the book. And while I have not yet read that, the extras told me about it. But while you may feel blue about that, the movie could not have ended any other way. And Kubrick again is able to manipulate his audience, making them feel stuff (which incidentally they should not like at all - most of the things they are feeling - and maybe even feel a bit of guilt).It's also nice to hear, that Kubrick was open to ideas. And that he obviously had a conscience, which is something many thought he had not - especially watching this movie. So there are a few moments that were improvised but there were of course everything staged - and one of the biggest things is the sexual component in the movie - which has a big part combined with all the violence. There is too much sexual objects and hints - one might say it was kind of foreboding ... but then again, it seems to be human nature overall, so he just took something that was there and ran with it.There's so much to depict here - set design, framing/cinematography, dialog, mood, acting ... you could write about so many things, that all culminate in a great movie - if you can stomach to watch it of course",10,3,4,24 May 2019
Stalingrad," Brutal history lesson
","Now I'm not familiar with every little detail and the movie may not be depicting what happened exactly. Yet this is as realistic and as a war movie can go. I had no idea what a gem they had produced back then. It is unrelenting and it is quite literally down and dirty. War is nothing to joke around about and it does things to people.And people obviously do things to other people. You especially see people who did follow orders but not always. You see human beings, who got caught in a big lie and who sacrificed themselves for a purpose that was crazy to say the least. But you also see humans who realize what they are and how they are being used (against their will). You see a will to survive - as with every living thing. And you see humility, but also cowardess. Every trait is going to be exposed ... for better or worse. And the war scenes are more than well shot. I am surprised and a little bit shocked! How did it take me so long to find this? You can call it Anti War (because in the end that is what the message is) or just war movie - one thing you will call it for sure is great",9,2,3,3 July 2019
Woman in Gold," Compelling and based on a true story
","Not always something people like to hear when they're about to watch a movie. And often times things get exaggerated to keep a certain tension throughout. If you can't wrap your head around those things, or are not too fond of predictable things that'll happen one way or the other, you might want to steer away from this.But you'd be missing on a really touching story and performances that are really good. You can really feel the passion, but also all the other emotions the characters are going through (jumping through hoops would be an understatement). So while there shouldn't be too much surprises along the way, the movie still is able to entertain",8,1,1,11 February 2016
Rio," I believe I can fly ...
","Or not. But what does matter is that the movie is fun. And it's not only fun for a younger audience, but also for adults to watch. Some (especially in Great Britain) were fed up with the movie even before they watched it, because the two stars of the movie were starring in an ad for a cell phone company (Orange). Of course that kind of treatment would be unfair to the movie.If you are not biased and can handle a bit of romance and the overcoming odds story, then you will enjoy this. As Jesse Eisenberg is spot on as a 'bird out of the air' so to speak. Even people who don't enjoy George Lopez as a comedian, might like him here. I thought his performance was spot on. Not a perfect movie overall, but the cast (as mentioned) and the mostly very well written jokes, work their magic!",7,1,1,22 December 2011
The King," The King is dead, long live the King
","I never fully understood this when I was younger, but the saying is sort of telling us that everything is moving on. It's like saying after the game, is before the game. There is always a continuation, whether you or other persons are involved in that or not.And the same applies here. Timothee Chamolet is riding high (no pun intended) but he's not alone. The cast is amazing, the story gripping and there is enough to sustain your attention and be entertaining enough for the run time. For some if may have slower passages, but those are needed. Like a calm before the storm - also if you like medieval stuff and knights you don't even need me convincing you to watch this",8,4,5,10 March 2020
National Treasure," Indiana Cage
","It's not Nic Cages or the filmmakers fault, but Indiana Jones did set a standard for adventure movies. And if it involves artifacts or anything of value (as in this case) than the first thing that springs to mind is Mr. Jones.Of course there are differences and this movie can stand on it's own two feet! Especially with a comedic sidekick like the one on display here. He's worth the ticket/renting price alone. Maybe you think his jokes are so good, that you have to buy the DVD. Whatever the case is, this movie is just plain good ol' fun. And while the female lead does not entirely convince here (maybe playing the most beautiful girl in the world - Troy - was already her peak? The question comes to mind, because how could you possibly top that role, right?), the movie has a feel good vibe to it. While Mr. Harvey Keitel is more a bystander, he does add to the flavor of the movie. Far from his 'Bad Lieutenant' days, but that wouldn't really suit the movie now would it? Just don't try to think to much and/or compare it to the Indiana Jones franchise and you'll enjoy it! :o)",6,1,1,10 July 2008
How to Train Your Dragon," skill comes with practice
","It's always nice to see a non-Pixar movie being able to convey emotions not only to children, but also to the adults that accompany them. And while I'm sure you won't be able to tame a dragon after you watch this (first you have to find one of course), it is a very fine movie, that has just a few minor flaws.And even those will not really be seen by most people (as flaws), because they might just not care. It's a movie that is about peace of course, but there still is a big danger. And of course quite a few things might be a bit too simple. Now again, if it weren't for Pixar, I might not even notice or care about those things. But there is Pixar and to make a perfect animated picture has become really hard.Still very good (hence the rating), so more than worth a look! (Great voice cast)",8,0,0,4 October 2010
Limitless," There are limits
","Don't get it twisted: This movie has quite a few flaws. But if you are looking for inconsistencies and illogical behavior, you could do that game with any movie and succeed. This movie however succeeds in being simple and silly enough to be really enjoyable. And maybe this, in addition with Hangover 2 helped Bradley Cooper to become the sexiest man alive 2011 (or whatever he got called, though quite a few Ryan Gosling fans were upset about that result).Back to this movie though. Coopers character has a choice to make and he might not be the most likable character, but you can still care for him. Because after all he's acting and behaving like a human. And even someone who knows it all or has abilities others don't have, does not act always as smart as he is capable of. Plus: What fun would it be, if our main actor would be completely flawless? That's right, it would be a boring movie. And this is anything but boring (unless you hate Coopers guts and can't stand the 'story' presented here that is of course)",8,1,3,4 January 2012
Rocky," Underdog
","The making of the movie, seems to mirror the movie itself. As much as Sylvester Stallone struggled to make the movie, as much is his character Rocky in a struggle in life. And that's what makes the movie so great. The boxing reflects the life of it's characters. And Sly believed in this movie, which is why he wanted to star in it too. His choices were right.Beginning from the script, to the actors he chose, to the music (I'm only going to say stairwell, because who ever saw the movie, can't deny the power of that scene ... and the music that played an integral part for it to work). Everything fits like a glove ... (no) pun intended.And while it seems so simple, it actually isn't. Ask 'Ali' (the movie) or 'Cinderella Man'. Both with big star players, both 'Box movies', but both didn't succeed (at least commercially). There aren't many great movies about boxing, but this is definitely one of them (like the entirely different 'Raging Bull').",9,1,1,21 July 2009
Don't Breathe," There's more than the ... eye can see
","Pun very much intended, but let's not get carried away too much. The guy who remade the Evil Dead does Horror Thriller and he has a very stellar cast in his corner. Especially Stephen Lang is phenomenal in a different and very demanding role. His screen presence is great and you can understand certain things that are happening. Or how he and the others react to be more exact.Having said that, there are still some odd clichés here and there. But never mind those and enjoy the thrill ride, because this really is quite breath taking. Although the title obviously is referencing something different. Doing something bad, may not be as evil as it seems ...",8,4,7,6 June 2017
Sicario," No borders here
","If you haven't read anything about the story or I reckon if it's not in the trailer, than the beginning of this movie will definitely feel like a punch in the gut, while you watch it. Even if you have it will have an impact of course, but it is even greater without knowing anything. And while it is silent (sort of), you will feel a great impact.So while some might feel that this strong beginning might (or rather is) kind of hurting the rest of the movie, I do think that it just sets a tone. And makes the character decisions relatable. Emily Blunt is the moral compass and should be the conscious of the viewer. We go on a ride with her and while she is trained in certain things, even her stomach cannot handle everything. Not to mention her mind and body of course ... But there is a reason it's called 'war on drugs'.",9,0,0,7 October 2016
Pretty Woman," How to ...
","A 90s classic, that I just saw the other day. And I have to admit, it was better than expected. The romance thing worked out as expected and there are not many surprises here (nothing explicit), though you have Julia Roberts performing quite a few lewd acts. Just not visible to us, but more than hinted at.Having said that, some of the jokes are quite stiff - you know it's hard ... to do just good jokes. Now you may have gotten the innuendos and you either like them or think they are weak. But that is one of the examples of things you get from the movie. Which I probably would have rated a 7, if it weren't for the chemistry of the two leads. Don't ask too many questions, about how this may go on after the credits roll and how this will work in general.",8,1,1,27 May 2020
The Descent," A few good women
","You have a group of women here, who are about to enter a cave, to forget something that happened in the past. A sort of going deep inside, to find a way out of one's misery. As you can guess from the title, the cave is in/down the earth rather than in a mountain. Although that's not where the film begins, it's where the movie starts really.The movie begins quite some time earlier than the cave event, but this back story is held to a minimum amount of time. You then get served a bit of character moments, before the women go 'down' ... and the action begins. The acting is pretty good, but it's the setting itself that creates the tension and will keep you on the edge of your seat. A great horror movie, that has quite a few references, even to war movies in it ... see here at IMDb for details on that one. Good scary 'fun' then!",8,1,3,6 July 2007
Inside Man," Nothing really new in this heist flick, but ...
","... it's really well done. If you see the movie, you might have guessed what this movie is aiming for (because you've seen similar heist movies), but still you will be amazed by this film! And that is a credit to all involved (starting from the scriptwriter, to the producers, director and cast).Although I have to say that I don't think you can guess, where this movie is going to go 100%. But it's cut and pasted together in a manner, that will make multiple views of the film more than enjoyable. So you might not understand what is going on, when you see a flash'forward' (as opposed to a flashback, but I just created that word, I don't think it exists), but you will get there sooner than later. Because Spike Lee knows that the audience is not stupid, he partly gives away the ending ... It's right there in front of you, so that the subplot becomes more relevant ... you will see!",8,1,2,25 April 2007
Jack Reacher," Jack Reacher (actually it's reach him)
","Off the top, let me say that I haven't read the books/novels, so if you are looking for input regarding how faithful this is, you should find another review. Only thing I was made aware of, that the original Reacher is actually bigger. But then Tom Cruises Hollywood status might make up for his lack of height (not that most people actually notice he is short, because filmmakers tend to film him appropriately, so it won't be obvious to the viewers).Apart from that, the story is pretty decent and the actors are good enough, even though people who have seen their fair share of thrillers will know where this is heading and what twists and turns this will take. Still it is fun and that does not only include a scene in the crowd and a hat involving Mr. Cruise aka Reacher, which you might have already seen in the trailer. Good action scenes and nice action acting makes this one entertaining if shallow movie.",7,2,4,14 July 2013
"McFarland, USA"," Real life story
","It's not easy to make this real life stories feel ... real. So while this moves along smoothly and makes it seem easy, it's not as easy to pull it off most of the time. Kevin Costner is no stranger to sports dramas of course and he makes a strong lead. But it's not only him who makes the movie work, it's the other actors too.You'd also have to have a heart of stone not to be touched by some of the very genuine moments in this. At the end, we also see the real people and what happened to them. It's predictable most of the time, but that doesn't take away anything from it or the impact it has on the viewer (those who let themselves dive in).",8,0,1,13 March 2016
Les Misérables," Sing-A-Long Road Movie History (Lesson)
","I should know better. It's not the movies fault or the original Musical, that I couldn't really enjoy this properly. I cannot for that matter compare this to other productions (be it stage or book form) of the subject matter. Obviously the movie covers a bit of History here, but it's the main characters that are the real attractions. Speaking of which: Wolverine, I mean Hugh Jackman gives the (oral) performance of his life! If anyone was doubting he could act, he more than proves it here, shouldering the movie amongst other things.While Anne Hatheway did spoil a bit (of her part/character), at least to me, she's equally enticing as is the rest of the cast. Even the sometimes misplaced looking Crowe. But he only looks slightly the way I felt about most of the singing. A movie that lasts over 2 hours and consists of 90 % of singing ... So you might want to add one or two points to my vote, unless you are fond of the book as a friend of mine is. He was very disappointed by the movie, which seems to be a common thing (read other similar reviews)",6,1,2,26 November 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," The sequel we've been looking for
","Of course the first one came completely from out of nowhere. Well not in a sense that no one knew the movie was being made or came out in the cinema. But no one expected anything from it. And it became this larger than life thing. With characters so well written and with just enough swagger and good dialog/one-liners, it's almost crazy that no one expected this would be great.So now it is expected, so how does it fair? Pretty good I'd say. We have established the characters, we know their traits and we can have fun. Even with conventions in general, breaking fourth walls and all (when it comes to love relationships for example). Of course if you haven't seen the first one, you may have issues with the movie. I've seen a couple of reviews where it was clear, they hadn't seen the first one. And while I do think this does work as a standalone, I'd say it may be risky when it comes to you liking this or not.The humor is there though and as we come to understand in the Marvel Universe, there are added scenes in and after the credits. Five in total to be exact! So sit back and enjoy them - if you had a good time watching the movie that is. Fantasy and comedy mixed with this great outcome: it's almost like you have to love it for it. Not to mention all the cameos",9,12,19,14 August 2017

","I don't know what all the fuss was about? This movie clearly doesn't declare that it is based on scientific facts or anything. It's based on a fictional book. You could argue about the casting, though! Tom Hanks might not be the best choice here, but he's good enough to convince! It all begins in a museum, where Tom Hanks character meets Amelie ... ;o) Seriously though: This movie works as a mystery thriller, with many clues to what is really going on. But most people will have read the book, so they might know what is going to happen anyway. Unfortunately (or maybe not?) I hadn't read the book, so I can't compare the movie to the book ... But if you have the time, I'm sure the book, is the better option ... especially for your imagination ...",6,1,4,25 April 2007

With other series, it's easier to distinguish, which one is part 1, 2, 3 etc. etc. Even the Naked Gun series which has Parts 2 and half and 33 and a third, you still know the order (not of the Phoenix obviously!) ;o) But enough about my (let's call it) ignorance, for the books (haven't read them guilty as charged) and off to the movie itself. Which is obviously targeted at a young audience. And it delivers on this premise. Plus it has to introduce characters to the world (for those who know them and those who don't). A good job overall, but nothing great in my eyes ...",6,0,2,10 October 2007

For a family friendly wizard, that is quite an accomplishment.By now (assuming you know the other movies and/or books) most of the characters have been established, with Sirius Black being one of my favorite, because Mr. Oldman can play 'against' type (he's so often casted as a bad guy it's nice to see him play someone good for a change)! What's also nice is that you can see a development and a story continuation (although for some it might be too slow) ... but then again, it's all in the book(s), isn't it? (that's not a rhetorical question ... I Sirius-ly don't know ... sorry had to do it ;o) )",8,1,2,10 October 2007
In Time," Values and a High Concept
","You should know that this movie will never delve into deep psychological nor sociological studies. It will never satisfy anyone who wanted something deep and thoughtful. What is is, is an entertaining movie with a very good idea to back it up. While some may argue that Timberlake might not have been the best choice as lead actor, I think he does a good job with the role he has on hand here.You also get Alex Pettyfer in a role that hints at him being more than a pretty face. Still not a real challenge of course, this may lead to more serious roles for the guy. While the film got quite a lot of momentum during the 'Occupy' movement (you can see why, after you watched the movie), it will never be able to get close to movies like Blade Runner and others. But try not to judge it like that and you will have a good time watching this tension filled Sci-Fi Thriller.",6,2,4,23 March 2012
Thor," Thor be or not Thor be?
","While I was as surprised as any Branagh fan, when I heard he would helm a comic book movie, I have to admit, he kept it light and amusing, while still holding onto the threats and delivering a fun character introduction. :o) Now I can understand, that some people might not like the way this movie is done or are fed up with comic book movies in general. What you cannot say about this movie though, is that it doesn't have a decent enough character or story development. It is cliché, of course, but that does not make it any less decent now does it? It might make it boring for you, of course.Acting-wise, no one is taking him- or herself too serious. Which is a good thing. I liked everyone in this and didn't feel like the jokes were forced. Of course you could argue about political correctness (Thors 'friends'), but that would be nit-picking, now wouldn't it? So if you can enjoy a nice fun little ride of a movie, than I can recommend this to you",8,1,2,26 December 2011
The Happening," It's not gonna happen
","I had my fair share of 'trouble' with a Night movie! Happening is not one of them. And it's not because I'm trying to buck the trend (the overall voting here is speaking for itself), but because I really liked the understatement and the underplaying of the movie. It's not about panic, it's about a message, that Night tries to send through. Well the message is very clear and still some won't like what they'll see and won't like the bluntness with which the movie delivers this message! I liked the acting and I liked the point Night was/is making with this movie. It's a slow building chilling experience (if you let yourself into it), which does not rely on any 'twist' ending or anything like that (didn't work for 'Village' imo). If you watch the movie, with other expectation than that, you will be disappointed (as many have been).",8,2,5,18 August 2008
The Shape of Water," Fishy
","When a movie gets that much praise some may find it difficult to watch this without any prejudice. So you may have certain expectations that might be higher than would be good for the movie. Then again, the movie can hold the pressure if you let yourself into that fairy tale. Because this is what this is, the beginning alone is evidence of that.But not your usual run of the mill fairy tale. This is a more adult version of that. Evidence is the weird love story, but even more a very violent scene that might be quite shocking to many people who are not used to this. Is the movie without fault or flaws? Of course not, but it does convey what it sets out to do. And whether you agree with this winning Oscars or not, or whether you find the story engaging enough, the movie delivers a certain standard that is way above average.",9,2,19,11 April 2018
The Godfather: Part III," Aftermath
","16 years after the second Godfather came out, finally the long awaited sequel arrived. And it was received well by the academy, when it comes to the nominations. It didn't win anything, but just the sheer amount of nominations are proof, that they must have done something right. And the movie is good. Al Pacino returning again and playing exceptional as he did in the other movies too. You do wonder why he never won an Oscar for the character of Michael Corleone.Andy Garcia is a welcome addition (even if he mirrors his father Sonny) and not the only thing that reminds or is supposed to be a throwback to the first Godfather. There are many hints at what Pacino does or where he goes that connect this movie to the other movies (even the second one, with the oil company mentioned by Garcias character). So if you have been following the movies, there are many treats for you to be found here.It still concludes the sage that started with the first movie, for better or worse. So while people wanted another movie (and maybe still urge for that), I would tell them to watch the Sopranos. The fact that it's a TV show works for it, because it has more time to develop characters and show you stuff that is tough to put in a movie (even a long one as this here, with almost 3 hours running time). The ending might not be to everyones taste, but I think it suits the trilogy to go out like that ... Whatever that means to you",8,1,3,4 February 2013
The Disaster Artist," Acting like really bad
","Watching this after having seen 'the Room' might elevate the experience you had with the Room itself. It might also work to watch this and then go ahead and watch the Room. Or maybe you save yourself the trouble of watching the room - because you might be cursing me afterwards. But enough about one of the worst movies ever ... because it spawned one of the best ever and I'm not being cynical about it.If you still needed evidence for James Francos acting ability - look no further! Even though the real Tommy first prefered Johnny Depp to play him (might have been great too if you think about it), this is genius. It's so spot on, I actually want to see Franco, Franco, Rogen and the others do the whole The Room - while I wouldn't watch the original The Room again anytime soon, I'd watch that. Closest is this movie about making it of course. It's a celebration of the love of movies - no matter how bad they are. And the Room is just a stand in for all of them - actually you could say it got lucky, because the Francos made it international (it was infamous before, but it reached a whole new level with this 'tribute' to it)",9,1,2,4 April 2018
Zombieland," Napoleon Dynamite meets Woody Harrelson in a Zombie World
","That's the way I felt about the movie. I didn't really think of this as an American answer to Shaun of the Dead. Shaun is pretty unique (to this day at least) and really funny. Zombieland is a Zombie action comedy like Shaun, but that's pretty much all these two movies have in common! Were Shaun had a different kind of world and the characters had some goals they wanted to go/achieve, the two main characters in Zombieland don't have that. It pretty much plays like a sketch show, with different settings holding the movie together rather than a story that runs through it. A cameo, that might seem a bit weird, especially the way it does end, is just another testament to that.But again, this movie is here, for you to enjoy and not to compare to other things. So if you like zombie movies and like to be entertained in general, than you shouldn't worry and give this a watch!",7,2,4,25 November 2009

I haven't read the books, so I'm obviously oblivious to any facts from them and can't comment on any kind of accuracy or not, in adapting them. I also can't tell you which parts are better in the book or if they left too much out.Having said that (guilty as charged for not having read any Potter book), I have to admit, that I did like the second part better than the first one. But that does happen sometimes, especially with movies, where much explanatory work has to be made (I'm talking about the first Potter of course, I think Chambers ... no wait, I can't remember the title, doesn't really matter though). Now they can start to develop a little bit ...",7,0,2,10 October 2007

I hoped for more (although it is well rounded, beginning - end connection, of course I'm talking about the psychiatrist), but what I saw was satisfying enough. I mean what can you do with a crazy premise like that? Two hit-mans in love with each other, but both don't know what profession the other one is doing ... no wait that was the plot outline for 'Assasins' with Antonio Banderas and Sylvester Stallone ... ;o) Just kidding, of course its the plot line for this movie. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are even married (in the movie), how did they know what their life partner is doing? And how would it be possible, that they had to kill each other? But it works fine, especially with a great supporting part from Vince Vaughn. Now I just have to watch the re-cut, which is supposedly even better!",7,5,7,3 July 2007
The Departed," Scorsese did a good job remaking an awesome movie
","Most of the people who went to see the Departed, didn't know anything about the movie 'Infernal Affairs'. A great Chinese movie (part one of a trilogy), that left viewers yearning for more cop thrillers like these. Although no one actually thought of an US Remake. But if you make an American version, at least use a great director. Which they did, with Scorsese.The story isn't exactly copied from the Chinese Original, but you get many high points from the Original. And some shock moments, might not shock you as much as they did with people, who haven't seen the Original. Some roles are also changed here. And here comes a funny fact (it might be written here on IMDb somewhere), that of one Jack Nicholson, who changed his role and the script as they went along with the filming. And even if his co-stars didn't mind (at least they didn't say otherwise), Ballhaus (cinematographer, DP) wasn't amused! And it seems as if this incident (like changing the whole set-up for a scene, just for Nicholson and lighting kind of everything, just to be sure to have Jack's spontaneous outbursts on film) causes Ballhaus considering, not working with Scorsese anymore.But that's just behind the scenes. What matters is the result on screen. And that is good enough to watch. After reading the Oscar nominations, one could feel, that it might be Scorsese time. And although it's not his best film he ever made, Scorsese was overdue for an Academy Award!. I haven't said anything about the movie's plot, because I think you should watch the Original for the full impact ... but only if you're not afraid or have prejudices against Chinese movies!",7,1,4,9 May 2007
Psycho," A must-see
","Especially if you are into thrillers. I haven't seen the shot-by-shot remake that came out, 10 years or so ago, but if you watch one Psycho, it should be this one. Actually if you watch more than one Psycho, it would be good if you'd watch the other Psychos (Psycho 2, 3 and so forth). Although they are with Anthony Perkins, I'm pretty sure they are not as good as this one though.A very eerie performance by Mr. Perkins then, with a very interesting idea (that hopefully comes as a surprise when you watch it, because it would be a shame if someone did spoil you the movie, by telling you what will happen). Quite a few things get done here and other directors have taken those ideas and used them time and again. It's a testament to Hitchcocks genius, how good his movie works and still how much tension is in it, because it hasn't aged a bit.A great movie, by a great director. I watched it recently at a cinema, but I have to admit, that I missed the small cameo Hitchcock has in his movies. That's saying something about how gripping the movie was for me. And since I hadn't seen it for quite some time, I really discovered quite a few things, by watching it. So even if you have seen it, you can watch it again and again!",10,0,0,21 November 2009

I should actually have written 'make American Drugs again'. Why export money, when you can have the money in America? Especially when you think that the money fuels the cartels. Although they do buy American weapons so ... But politics aside, which is hard to do, especially in this real life case of crimes commited, let's move on.The story seems pretty simple and while some are mad that the movie takes liberties in telling it, you should remember, this is just a movie. If you want to know about the real scoop, do some internet research and find out what really happened. The movie is here to entertain and entertain it does. Some things seem rather ridiculous, but they work in the context. I myself have not read up on the true story, this was enough for me.",8,2,2,23 February 2018

We even get treated the same guys that made the first movie work. So what went wrong then? Quite a few things I'd say and I'm going to list them ...Story: Apart from the fact, that it's a pretty simple premise, do we really need a complex story for a summer blockbuster? I would say no, but having it be completely ridiculous like in this movie, is way beyond, what audiences should accept.Actors: While we really enjoyed them the first time around, they're not getting real screen time here. And when they get time to talk, the talk so fast, that you wonder how they can follow their own thoughts ... Don't try to understand everything then? Yes and it is a shame. Having an explosion/action sequence every 2 minutes isn't really helpful, especially because you're not getting anything out of the characters.Transformers/CGI: Actually this is one thing they did pretty good in this movie, hence the 3/10 instead a 1/10. But even the great effects suffer from ...Editing: We should be used to MTV cuts by now, but when you have two robots fighting each other, 100 cuts in 10 seconds tend to confuse you rather than give you something you can enjoy. A shame then, because as stated above the CGI is really great.A shame this movie couldn't really be the summer Blockbuster we all anticipated (G.I. Joe took that spot) and I won't even go into plot holes and other crazy stuff, that just doesn't work in (favor of) the movie! And that's why I actually canceled a second viewing, that I had planned, before I even watched the movie. It would just be too painful!",3,2,14,14 September 2009
The Witch," Bewitching
","Do not believe your eyes or let's not be deceived. Also do not lose your faith. Or maybe you're just a realist and finally see what's really what. What may sound like crazy talk is just me trying to prepare you for this movie. Because this may have been promoted as a horror movie in many countries (and the filmmaker knew this could get him into trouble, but also that distributors like to put things in boxes to promote them), it's more a folk-tale as the full title is suggesting.The movie is open to be interpreted any way you like. And it is also open to be viewed, liked or hated in any way the viewer sees fit. It will annoy a lot of people, but it also will delight a lot of people. It's not horror as I already said, but it is frightening if you get into the mood of it and let the movie do its job. Otherwise you'll be bored and won't enjoy any of it - you can tell very early on which will be the case ...",9,2,5,31 December 2016
Jersey Boys," One of the best biopics made
","Musical biopics that is. And having Clint Eastwood behind the camera is showing. He's not afraid of showing some downsides to the fame the Jersey Boys (you could also use their stage name of course). He's also very open to giving the support guys their moment. It's refreshing to see that there is more to a group than just two guys. And that the other 'characters' actually have an opinion themselves.The movie is also able to make you sentimental and maybe make you shed a tear or two. There are songs here, that I knew, but had no clue who sang them. A really good orchestrated story with a lot of good music and a sort of sing a long thrown in for good measure. Drama and comedy mix good together and even if there is some heightening here and there, this is really good",9,3,6,26 September 2014
When Harry Met Sally...," And again and again ...
","Love at first sight or does the flame have to actually be set off over several times? There are different ways two individuals fall in love and we get some interviews here that highlight that. I have not researched if the people in this are actually together or if they just retell stories from actual couples. Whatever the case, the case here is you get a really good romantic comedy.And as far as I can tell it all came about the director having issues in his own love life. Now there is something (a lesson) to learn: even when you are down and don't feel good, you can make something productive. Also reassuring to those who may feel neglected or unsure if they'll ever find love.But this is not just a good comedy, it has one of the best known movie scenes. Just as people are aware of the 'Say hello to my little friend' line, they are aware of the 'I'll have what she's having' line. And it is uttered by none other than the mother of the director. Now either this was a therapy session or maybe they needed some after this - or they just have one of the loveliest mother-son relationships, that no Psych should question.Really good and 'real' movie (the dialog may annoy you, some of you, but it is great and on the spot) that does not feel like it has aged. The director has proven he is good at what he does already ... and here's another example of just that",9,0,0,28 June 2020
Zero Dark Thirty," Catch him if she can
","A lot has been made of this movie. Some say it is not as realistic, some criticize it for being either pro or Anti Obama. But that is not what Bigelow went out to make. She was fascinated by everything about OBL. If and how accurate her depiction is, of how exactly that came to happen is another story. But she does not pull any stops and she does not tell people how to feel about certain things. Right from the get go, we get a scene of torture (which made some people leave cinemas around the world, I guess because they didn't expect a depiction like that), which shows us that she wants to keep it real.Of course I can understand that some are not happy with Chastains character. She is driven without apparent motivation. But that is how some people work. They let their work consume their lives. There are not really characters you can cling onto, another thing I can understand as criticism. What you can't fault the movie with though, is not caring or not being professional. The big theme is OBL, that doesn't mean that other things will be left out, but it does mean, that it is the goal it works forward to. If you're willing to accept that, you might be able to watch it and not be disappointed",8,1,3,5 July 2013
Crazy Heart," Powerhouse performance(s)
","Jeff Bridges deservedly not only got nominated but won the Academy Award for his powerhouse performance (and it was about that time he got one of those statues, considering all the roles he has played up to Crazy Heart too).The movie did not move along as I expected it. Anything but, because it is very slow and does concentrate almost solely on one period of time in the life of the country singer played by Jeff. But when I adapted to the concept, the movie really got me.It might move along in a slow pace and it might seem that not much is happening, but it's in the subtle hints (not only in the more than stellar performances, by everyone involved, but by the story and things going on in the background). You will not get hammered over the head with things. You can figure a few things out (if you want to) or leave them be.The way they handle the movie is a stroke of genius (imo) and I really liked the movie a lot. But I can see, that some people might have expected something else or where let down by the structure of the movie.",9,1,1,8 October 2010
War of the Worlds," Forget about the plot holes ...
","... and you might be able to enjoy this. Also if you hate the Cruiser (Tom Cruise that is), you might have a difficult time with the movie, too. Many people criticized his acting at the beginning of the movie, but I thought it was good and it also had Dakota Fanning, to earth it/make it believable.The movie starts slow, but gets in gear fast and stays fast paced throughout ... well not entirely, because when a certain character comes into play late in the movie, it all slows down. You could say it comes to a halt. A full stop so to speak ... and although the following segment is very good, if looked upon as a separate piece, it just feels weird and not right in the movie (for pacing reasons alone).The end won't satisfy many people too ... but it's difficult to find an ending that will satisfy everybody I guess ... btw. I didn't like it as well, but you have to make up your own mind. All in all a nice sci-fi pic then and sometimes even really scary and also real (emotions of the people) ...",6,3,6,3 July 2007
Love Actually," Blue-Print
","There are some romantic comedies that could be used as a blueprint. Or maybe some directors should just watch them, before they bring out their bog standard version of 'man loves woman' and vice versa. This episodic tale of ... well 'Love actually', has great actors in it (Bill Nighy, Keira Nightly and so forth), that make the most of even small stories and screen time.While this set around Christmas time, this is also a hint, that you shouldn't take the movie too seriously. The romantic factor in the stories works and every kind of love gets a stab at. It is a feel-good movie, a movie that speaks to the heart and actually achieves to send this message (again, too many shallow rom-coms, not here/this one though!)! I'm cynical too, but sometimes it's nice to have movie, that shows you what different meanings love can have and how love is perceived by different individuals!",9,5,8,21 July 2009
12 Years a Slave," Wrong Place, wrong time
","The movie gives you what it says. And there are things that are far from easy to watch. The title itself is an indicator, so be sure you want to watch a movie that will go to dark places. And there a couple of scenes that linger and seem to go on for forever (which is again, more than hard too watch).Obviously things like that did happen and it is despicable that some people still will try to make it sound as harmless as possible. Whatever the case, after you watched this, you'll agree that slavery is nothing that should be tread lightly. Star names aside, this does take you on a emotional roller coaster and you will find yourself hating characters for what they do.It's nearly impossible to stay/watch this without a hint of an emotion. Be prepared for that and watch it, if you can ...",9,1,3,18 June 2014
30 Days of Night," Hello Sunshine
","Unlike some (many?) other reviewers, I prayed for sun light. I could've left the cinema, but I went into a late screening, so no hope there ... but seriously: This was a waste of time. Begins good (if you extract the obvious and bland character bits), but get's unbearably every minute that passes by ... I'm glad it isn't told in real time! Back to some positive things: Josh Hartnett plays the lead role here and he's surprisingly good (for me he is at least). The lead vampire is OK, too. That's about it ... OK there's a bit gore that can excite you here and there, but that doesn't really get my blood flowing (pun intended) ... and speaking of which: Melissa might be good looking, but she can't really act, if her life depended on it (oops another pun?)! What could've been the problem one might ask, with a plot outline like that (see somewhere here on IMDb for that)? Since I read interviews with the main players, I think I have an answer to that: They didn't know what they were shooting! From Josh over to Melissa, over to the head vampire up to the director, everyone had another genre they thought this movie belonged in ... Wanna know the real fun part? No one mentioned horror and/or vampire movie! Yeah right! Guess we have our reason, why the movie did suck at the end of the day (aww man, two puns in one sentence? There's no better way to end a review than this ...)",5,4,7,27 January 2008
Sausage Party," Not for kids!
","Some people still think kids movie when they see an animated US production. And that is mostly the case. Just not here as you will see if you watch this. It was clear for those who followed it, what it would be. Well maybe not exactly what it would be, but you knew what direction this was taking.A very adult and dirty minded one. Another reviewer correctly called this out on its 'jokes' and obscenity. Although if you are offended by the first couple of minutes and innuendos, than you better not watch until the end. The last 10 minutes or so went places ... all at once. Even though it wasn't being soft before, this really went way overboard. So if you can lower everything down (pun intended) and just let yourself slide into this ... experience, you might be able to have fun with it. Though again this is very special .. in its craziness.",6,1,1,14 June 2017
Wedding Crashers," Great comedy ... but the drama part of it ...
","... is not good, to be quite honest. It's always the hardest thing, in a romantic comedy, to work out the serious/drama part and make it believable in the whole context of the movie. And I for once, look for standards, that unfortunately most movies fail to hit or to come by, as is this one.The comedy part is great (I've only seen the theatrical cut), Owen and Vince work great together. The beginning of the movie is fast and has some hilarious moments ... it even works out up to the point of the one wedding, that is going to be very crucial for both of them. After that there are of course not many big surprises coming up (you'll know where it all leads eventually), so it's a shame the second part is overshadowed with so much drama ... drama and problems, that don't seem real (in the context of the movie and the relationships of the characters that is).If you're not thinking too much as I did, you might enjoy this movie more than I did, but I just saw too much missed opportunities in this.",6,0,0,3 July 2007
There Will Be Blood," It's DDL time
","OK Daniel Day Lewis more than deserved the Oscar! If there were a voting for the actors, I would've given him a 10/10. Even his co-stars are really good, although no one else can shine as DDL does (it's just impossible). While I was mesmerized by his performance there were also people who thought he was over the top/too theatrical. I can see why one would say that and it's kind of how I felt about another part of the movie.I'm talking about the music of course. While I heard many people praise it afterwards, I can only say that I was annoyed by it. As I came to understand, music (score for a movie) is meant to be subtle and you shouldn't really notice it. If you stop watching the movie and start listen to the music, than something is off (in my book). In this movie I often noticed the music and although the intention was/is clear (underline the emotion of the characters), it just came off as over the top most of the time. And while that might have worked (or not depending on your angle on it) on some classics such as Ben Hur, I never really was a big fan of it.Anyhow, apart from the music thing and the slow moving plot (although there is not much of clear storyline, it's more like a 'life-story' of some sorts, not that that's a bad thing, just bare it in mind) it delivers a good movie overall ...",7,0,4,14 July 2008
Ice Age," Evolution
","An animated picture that is really good and it's not from Pixar? Then it must be from Walt Disney Pictures, right? Well ... no! This little movie that dared and could, comes not from the Disney House (and/or Pixar which is now part of the big Disney family), but still is a great movie.While it has a few flaws (especially pacing wise), it convinces with it's very funny characters. A great first movie, that introduces us to characters we learn to love. And you have an animal (to love) for everyone. The talented voice cast turns it up a notch and make you forget about the very pale 'humans' (depicted in this movie).",8,0,0,14 September 2009
Joker," Not joking ...
","Mental health issues are a problem in our society. Or how they are viewed upon and how they are handled. The depiction of a deteriorating mind in this not really comic book movie, is quite something. Even Scorsese would approve I reckon. We're talking about a performance too, that really surprised me. I never thought I'd see another Joker character/actor coming close to what Heath Ledger did over a decade ago.But here we are (or are we? A question for a different time I guess), with a new Joker. But a movie or rather a story that will keep you on your feet. Joaquin is so mesmerizing that I would not be surprised if he got the Oscar. Since the nominations came out, we know this is a possibility, but everyone who watched it, was expecting him getting nominated. That the movie would get 11 nods though ... that was quite unexpected.Not all is as it seems, as with this movie being a drama rather than a 'thrill park ride'. Now that doesn't mean you have to have one thing and not the other. As a big fan of the MCU, I can admit really liking this. Then again, this is not even near the DCU ... don't compare this to something other (be it comic books or like a friend to Parasite, another favorite of mine of 2019) - enjoy it for what it is! A great movie",10,1,8,15 January 2020
The Bridge on the River Kwai," We'll cross that bridge when we ... oh
","The scope and scale of this movie is quite something. The fact you have a couple of character being front and center and are being followed by the movie and the viewer is also something to behold. The first one to get our full attention is an American, who seems quite smart. Maybe he is, we will find out. But another British character is coming to steal the show.Now while the movie has strong characters, it also deals with quite a few cliches. And it's not just the fact that captive and captor will build a relationship, but how the Japanese 'bad guy' is behaving. People nowadays who would call themselves 'woke', will find themselves quite troubled seeing his behavior. Some might even call it borderline racist.Now you can be mad at me for calling this out, but I'm just giving you food for thought. Maybe you notice, maybe you don't care, but it is there, whether on purpose or just for storytelling reasons. I doubt it is just the latter considering the time it was made (politically speaking and everthing).Now if you conquer that 'obstacle', there is a lot of tension filled run time ahead of you. The pacing may seem a bit slow for some, but production values and acting is ace! There are a few reasons this was and still is celebrated - the size of it being one of them. Almost a must watch for any film lover - for various reasons",8,0,0,15 April 2020
Man on Fire," Denzel on a mission
","This is a remake of an 80s movie. But before you go all out and yell at Hollywood not being able to make unique new movies, consider this: The original wasn't that good to begin with. And frankly I'd rather have them remake a movie that had a strong central idea but wasn't executed as well (for whatever reason that might have occurred, money/time/actors/filmmakers), than make something ridiculous and try to sell it to us as the best thing ever.This of course isn't the best thing ever either, but with Denzels strong lead performance (sometimes literally), it does have a way of convincing you. Mr. Scott is known for his visual style and he doesn't disappoint here either. Quite a lot of things going on, that on the other hand might be distracting to some. Supporting actors and a very fast paced narration lead to an enjoyable (sometimes a bit violent) ride.",7,0,0,25 July 2012
Edge of Tomorrow," Watch this Will Smith
","The story has been written a couple of times on here, I won't repeat it again ... Pun intended. But aside from that(which kind of redefines 'repeated' viewing a bit), the movie is actually pretty good. While the initial pushing into the whole mess story, is a bit stretched, it does work out and make sort of sense.Plus you have two great actors who are game to go all the way. Emily and Tom are a great pair and the chemistry is obvious on screen. Everything they do makes sense and the script really does treat the viewer as if he/she are intelligent human beings. Which is nice for a change (in Hollywood Land). The end (or third act or whatever you want to call it), might seem a bit stretched, especially considering what has been done before, but after all you won't mind too much and be just thrilled and enjoy the ride",8,0,3,20 September 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," Pitching Perfect
","I wouldn't call myself a fan of musicals, but I do love my 'pitches' (term used by the characters of this movie just in case you were unaware of that). And I did miss them while they were gone. And it looks like this one was so successful, they will be back. And while most male actors here (even those who 'survived'/came back from the first movie) are nothing more than a filler (you could argue they are having cameos), the executive for whom Kendricks character is working is pure gold (you might have seen some comedy skits of his).Other than that, we get a great mixture of female bonding together, fights in the family, a new member, a new 'villain' ('ze Germans' this time around) and a lot of Acapella. Well of course we do. One of the funniest skits is when towards the end we get that while trying to cross the street ... you'll either laugh or feel annoyed by it. For me it was the former. Same can be applied to the rest of the movie. And while I loved this one too (as I did the first one), I'm not sure a third one is/was necessary ... but I sure will Aca-watch it!",8,10,16,8 July 2015
Whiplash," Carrot and stick
","What a performance or better performances. It was about the time JK Simmons got recognized (read won an award)! And it couldn't have been a more rewarding role than this. If you are used to your typical musician against all odds film, be aware that this is anything but this blueprint you are used to.We're talking about a power performance (no pun intended) that has been already spoofed a lot, only to show the love for the passion this project had. It is so draining watching some of the stuff, you can only begin to imagine how stressful it must have been for those involved. There is not much light in this, but there doesn't need to be - it's perfect just the way it is (or is it?)",10,1,3,22 June 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," It really is a comedy
","There is a reason this is called Wolf of Wall Street and not Lion of Wall Street. This is not supposed to be a story about some good guy or misunderstood guy doing things that are a little off. And therefor it was important to make this a comedy. When I watched it, I didn't think it would qualify as comedy. Thought of it more of a drama with some comedic moments thrown in.The way it starts should indicate if this is something you want to watch. Never forget, as someone else also stated, this is supposed to be entertainment and does not take itself seriously. If you are not on that level with the movie, you will call it names. And that is OK, because obviously the movie is out there and it will not be everyones taste. That's why you have to decide early on, if you actually want to watch it or not.If you don't feel like it, don't watch it. Save yourself some time and watch something else that interests you instead. If it hits a nerve with you though, you will revel in it. Especially in the performance Leonardo Di Caprio is giving. There is a scene involving him driving 'carefully', that has to be seen to be believed ...",9,4,9,18 June 2014
Army of Darkness," Evil Dead 3
","When I first watched this, I had no idea it was part of a series. It's been over 10 years since then and I have re-watched this (after watching Evil Dead 1 & 2) and it still very much holds up. As part 2 did, this invents a totally different back-story to support the new direction this is going. While part 2 also hinted on the funnier side of horror, this almost goes completely overboard with it! And it also shows Sam Raimis love for 'The Day the Earth stood still' (the original that is, not the awful Keanu Reeves remake).The movie had it tough though and Sam had to shoot a different ending than he intended. I actually like both endings (should be on the disc you're about to buy/rent), but I did watch the commercial/producers request one first. I might tend to like that one more because it seems to come full circle. Whatever your feelings are, this is funny and I can only hope an Army of Darkness 2 entry here on IMDb (even for 2016) proves to be legit (we've been waiting for so long now)!",8,3,5,29 August 2013
Scream 2," It's scream time
","The movie as it is, is pretty decent. I might have given it only a 6/10 (which is also good), but there is one moment in here, that really shocked me. Something that I guess people who have seen the original (and I am assuming you have in my review), will not see coming (unless they have read about it or someone told them).We have the survivors back and we also have the winning team back from part 1. Craven and Williamson do a pretty good job to continue the story (while not being as sharp as in the first one). While the first one ended with a pretty great climax (so simple and yet so genius), this one cannot top that. But it doesn't have to top it (especially with the great moment happening prior to that), it just has to entertain us. And that it does ...",7,0,0,16 October 2011
It Chapter Two," It ... concludes
","Now there are talks about an even bigger overall cut (the second movie is almost 3 hours as it is), so I can't talk about that right now of course, but I for one am looking forward to that, if it comes to fruition. Having said that and from what I remember from the 90s 'It', this was consistent! I liked the first chapter and I really like what they did with this one too.There may be things in the book that are still not included (some being a bit too adult or even sick from what I've heard), but this is quite extensive. And while this is quite predictable to some extent, it still manages to scare and entertain at the same time. This is not hardcore horror and I acknowledge that some may feel cheated, but if you can just watch it for what it sets out to do, you may be thoroughly entertained",8,1,1,25 September 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," Dry (humor)
","It is not only the humor that is dry, but you also get a dry story, that takes its time. It's not fast paced, some may even not consider this a comedy (as can be witnessed here in the comments section). But that is always in the eye of the Beholder. Humor is really something that can either make people happy or make them feel annoyed. If you like yours to be more in your face, than maybe this movie is not for you.Still you can either watch the trailer (the mood is there, the theme is there, it should tell you if you probably will have fun), or watch the first 15 minutes of the movie. If you're convinced by then, you'll enjoy it like I did. If not, it's probably better to stop and maybe check the few highlights you may have missed somewhere else. The performances are impeccable though",8,1,4,5 December 2016
Ice Age: Continental Drift," The 'truth' behind the continental drift
","Not really of course, but still funny to see, how Scrat affected our landscape and Ice Age 4 of course. Scrat again bringing the whole thing full circle (no pun intended). There are new characters introduced into this, but none are as charismatic as our Simon Pegg character from Part 3 was.All in all it is a really good continuation, that really connects with the whole family. There might be a few things that are almost too on the nose (too PC), but the balance is good overall. The voice talent is fabulous and although some story strands are not entirely explored in the movie, it is another successful installment in the long running series.",7,0,0,2 August 2012
American Gangster," ... but not Scarface
","I was really tempted to write 'African American Gangster' in the summary line, but since that's what most will read, sometimes even without looking at the actual comment of the movie, I was afraid it would stir too much discussion. But here in the text I can write it, because I can point out that it's a joke on the title of the movie and of course on all the PC thing going on right now (in our society). Just my kind of weird humor.But back to the movie, that could be called the 'Heat' of Russel and Denzel. Yes the two have played in a movie together before and who can't remember the classic Sci-Fi B-movie they were in? No seriously, does anybody remember the name of that movie? ;o) I have seen that first collaboration (minus Ridley of course), but it must have been at least ten years ago. It was nice as I recall/remember for the sort of movie it was. The funny thing is, that they might have had more on-screen time together back then, then they have now! Still now with Ridley directing them both and Russell C. leaving the staring (or 'better') role to Denzel, this movie is already considered a classic by many. Russell wanted the Denzel role here, but since Denzel gave him the better part in the Sci-Fi B-movie I was talking about earlier, Russell thought he owed Denzel (that's how it was written in Film magazines). But Russell's role got bigger (he fought for that of course), making his character more believable. And here are other similarities to HEAT. Russells cop is similar to Pacino's character. Caring only about his job and not so much about his family/wife. Of course he has some ticks/nuances that are different from Pacino's role, as has Denzel's character too, who's more of a family man (so to speak). But Denzel's character seems to have some similarities with the Nic Cage character from 'Lord of War'. Only a few things that seem to be identical, but then again this also could be just a coincidence.Anyway the point is, that Ridley made another great picture, having assembled a cast and crew that were/are on top of their game. Highly recommendable! :o)",8,0,1,6 July 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Another Charlie ...
","You could easily be fooled into thinking this is a Charlie Kaufman script/movie you're watching here (it isn't though, but Zach Helm the script writer is more than happy with this comparison). Maybe even directed by M. Gondry! A man (brilliantly played by Will Ferrell) who is hearing voices ... a voice over to be exact, that is talking about his life or what he is doing ... while he is doing exactly that. Sounds weird? It get's weirder (= better, literally!). You can see why the script draw all those beautiful performers and they all do a very good job portraying their characters. I won't go into the roles they play, just so that you will enjoy it more, when you watch it (I saw the movie as a Sneak Preview).If you're a fan of the weird & funny, this movie is a must-see! :o)",8,0,1,15 April 2007
The Reader," Outstanding performance
","Kate Winslet is outstanding in this movie. Her performance is not only the central one, but she is just phenomenal. Her performance is so great, that it almost made me rate this movie higher. But I'm not rating the acting, but the overall movie-experience that I had and what I think this movie deserves.'Deserves' might not be the right word, because the subject matter is a very ambitious one. And just for that might be rated higher by some people. But the problem is, that apart from the different time lines, the story and the decisions the characters make, leave you indifferent most of the time. And they shouldn't, because of the nature of them. But although Kate Winslet is great and the movie begins pretty strong, it all gets deluded along the way. A shame then, but a movie that drags to long, trying to make a point that is pretty clear from the get go (or after half the movie is over).",5,1,4,27 July 2009
The Wrestler," The Person
","Or you could describe the movie as 'It's not what happens inside a ring that counts' (no pun intended). And that is because the movie feels more like a documentary following a human being. The action that happens in the ring is secondary (at least to the viewing audience, not for the main character of course). So if you're after watching wrestling action, you're better off watching the wrestling shows on TV rather than this movie.Or if you have been following the wrestling scene, you also be aware of the documentary 'Beyond the Mat'. A very fine example that movie is and something Darren A. might have seen, before he did this movie. Of course Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei both deliver a standout performance, going to (dark) places, to deliver on their characters flaws and strengths. A great drama, that happens to play in the sports department and might be able to open the eyes to some viewers and their prejudice against calling wrestling a sport.",9,1,1,27 July 2009

","First things first: I have not seen any episodes of the original TV series this is based on. So no comparisons to that from me. This might have been a good thing from what I hear. But let's get back to this movie, that would've faired worse if Captain Jack ... I mean Johnny Depp wasn't in it. My niece who watched it with me, said she could spot Capt. Jack mannerisms. I hope that does not spoil the movie experience for you, but I guess this is the curse or the bad side of having created a great character.Still that is not the weak point of the movie. Not even the weirdness, which I thought was nice mostly. But the movie itself is just not funny enough. It is pretty silly, but unfortunately not in a good sense. There is a scene where my niece went 'That letter looks like ...' and while she was kidding I assume, I was still thinking 'Kids' these days. But apparently Tim Burton thought the same thing ... He played right into that and it just doesn't work. Best scenes are in the trailer, the rest can be forgotten (including one very dark moment at a camp fire). Not as bad as his Planet of the Apes re-imagining, but still far away from his best efforts",5,1,2,9 June 2012
Hancock," Inconsistent
","That PG-13 blockbusters (especially) normally don't explore the sexuality of it's main characters is one thing. But with a twist (that gladly is not revealed in the trailer) like the one revealed in this movie, there should've been a bigger exploration of that issue. For a regular super hero movie, it wouldn't really matter, but for a movie that tries to stay/ground itself into reality, it's more than a wasted opportunity! The twist also brings up a few questions and should at least bring us a big conflict, but neither (really) happens ... especially not the conflict. Another wasted opportunity. Of course every movie has it's weak points, what really makes the difference is the things that one finds in the movie, that makes it look good. But the trailer moments are the best (jokes) in the movie. Of course you know where this is going from the get go, but it still could've been more ... let's say sympathetic. And there are too many scenes that are repetitive (how many times can Hancock smash into things/destroy them, without getting boring). It might look good, but it could be more diverse too. It's a shame, because all I could see here, were many missed opportunities ... and I don't think a longer cut on DVD will make a big difference ...",4,1,2,12 September 2008
Kong: Skull Island," Vacation Island
","Not really of course. Or at least not for the characters involved. And speaking of them, let's get this out of the way straight from the start: there is not much meat on the characters of the story (no pun intended) and the story is pretty simple. It's about the spectacle and about having fun.So while most might agree that the original Kong is the best one, this still is an entertaining ride and watch. The actors are doing their best with little, but the main star is CGI and the action scenes. It is light and fun and it does not pretend otherwise. Samuell L. Jackson may have had better roles, but he's always given it a 100 %.I also urge everyone who watches this to wait until the credits are done. There is a neat little surprise/scene after them ...",8,4,6,26 July 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," It ends/begins here
","Depending on whether you're thinking Hobbit or Lord of the Rings. Whatever the case, you can't fault the movie for its technical side. It looks beautiful, but that was to be expected. Having only read a quarter of the Hobbit novel (which was the first movie more or less, with some additions), I can't comment on the differences in this, though people have stated that some characters weren't in the books and are seen here (it shouldn't matter though).I didn't like the fact that Jackson went for the '1 girl, two lovers' teen romance thing, but I guess you have to deal with some of those things and incorporate them into your movie. It's a good conclusion and it was a nice watch, which didn't feel like it was almost two and a half hours. You'll either love it or be bored by it",7,4,7,31 May 2015
Hitch," Subplot
","The main plot evolves around Will Smith and Eva Mendes, but the subplot is where the money is. And it's the only reason that makes the running time look reasonable. The subplot of course involving the 'King of Queens' actor (Kevin James). His scenes are by far the funniest in the movie! Although you might've seen most of them in the trailer, so they won't seem that funny, when you watch them in the movie. If you're a sucker for romantic comedies or a big Kevin James fan though, you won't mind the running time or the fact that most of the best jokes are in the trailer.",7,0,0,12 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The End (?)
","Of course it's not really 'The End', but an End to the 'new' trilogy, that Lucas shot, to find a closure to the Star Wars phenomenon! But also the birth of a special character. It's quite impossible, that you don't know, whom I'm talking about, but just in case, I won't mention the name! Many criticized Episode 2, for too much Romance, the first Episode for Jar Jar Binks (and the childishly mood it had)! So George Lucas had a lot of pressure for this film. And he himself said, that this one would be darker than the two other movies. And darker it is indeed. Still not too violent/dark, but on a PG-13 level. And that's more than OK, because it's a family movie we're talking about! And I won't go into the flawless CGI-Work on display here, it's apparent and obvious! There were many things, I didn't like (plot holes, bad character judgements and some soap elements), but all those were merely wiped out, by the last frames of the movie. It is the birth of a cult/icon (that was relished in the original trilogy, Episodes IV - VI) ... but then you also realise that, what if people who don't know the original trilogy, will watch Star Wars from Episode I - VI? There's one 'surprise', which won't be longer a surprise to them ...",6,0,2,20 May 2007
Ray," Ray Man
","Making the most out of ones situation. But also acknowledging the talent one has and being able to stand up to people trying to take advantage of you. And all that while not being able to see. Ray is a wonderful movie, that is not afraid to go to tough places and ask tough questions. It's also not just glorifying the person/musician many loved and still love for the music he made.No one starts from the top and especially back then, when you consider the color of the skin played a big role. While racism isn't gone and some could argue it resurfaced big again lately, this was made in a time when it seemed far away. Still Taylor Hackford is a great director and he knows how to get powerful performances out of his actors. Great story, great ups and downs and you don't even have to know much to really enjoy this human story ...",8,1,3,18 January 2017
Inception," (De-)Constructing
","So is it the most clever movie ever made or is it all just bogus? Don't expect me to answer that. Don't expect the movie to be everything. It can not be. And don't assume, just because you liked/hated the movie, everyone else should feel the same way. Nor just assume that you can pinpoint every viewer or put everybody in 3 categories. People are far too complex to analyze and put into one category.What I mean by that, is that you can like this and Transformers. Or hate both. You can also over-analyze this movie and list it's flaws (yes it has them as every movie has them and depending on your view of it, you might spot them and care or not), but apart from being visually stunning, it has a breathtaking story. And an ending that has been spoofed (at various internet sites), but that works very fine for the movie. Of course you could also feel that the end is a cheat. But again, I cannot tell you how to feel about this movie (or any other movie for that matter), I can only tell you, that it looks amazing and it made me chuckle for quite a few minutes in a breath-taking sequence.And no I did not get everything when I first watched it. I watched it a second time and there are still questions unanswered. Does or would something like that bother you? I didn't bother and the movie fully matched the expectations I had (this was my number 1 expected movie for 2010, the second most expected being 'Wall Street 2'). To me, Nolan is more than just a visionary filmmaker. He's a great artist.",10,0,11,23 October 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," On track
","I haven't seen the original 70s adaptation of the movie. I wanted to before watching this, but a friend wanted to watch it and I just did. I actually quite enjoyed it. It starts quite nice with a twist in the first case if you want to call it that. Generally speaking Kenneth does a great job directing and acting in his own movie.
The scope cinematically speaking is just amazing. You can't fault the movie when it comes to the cinematography. I think the acting is really good and the story is tension filled, so there goes that. I did not see the conclusion coming the way it did, but I guess it makes sense. And even then you get another nod at the end of this to something that might be in the Horizon. Sign me up for it, is what I would say. Entertaining and more than decent overall",7,3,7,21 November 2018
Lord of War," Anti-War
","This movie is hard to swallow. And maybe for some people to much to bear. I'm pretty sure that some will misunderstand it. Kind of like Scarface, I'm sure that some people will think that this movie is pro war. Or that at least it glorifies the men that sell guns. Which isn't true ...Yes Nicolas Cage plays wonderful and engaging as (almost) always. But that doesn't mean that people should want to be like him. On the contrary, he is cold to a point were he reaches the point of being emotionless. His brother is killed and he doesn't really care. A human being is shot in front of him and he thinks about how he can sell the gun, now that it has been used (which is btw. so politically incorrect, that I just love this scene!).In other words: Human life means nothing to/for him! OK he is rich and yeah he has a beautiful wife (although you can see that an end to this is in sight), but does that make him a happy person? I don't think so! And still I had mixed feelings at the ending. Because the movie 'made' me route for him! On the other hand I wanted him to get caught. But that is what I was talking about. It is controversial and although you might route for him too in the ending, it still is very clear, that people like Yuri Orlov (Cage) will not be your role model (at least they shouldn't be!)",9,0,0,4 April 2007
Sherlock Holmes," Expectations
","Going into this movie expecting to watch a Guy Ritchie movie, you won't be disappointed. Heading into this, expecting to watch something similar to older Sherlock Holmes movies ... well, let's just say, the chances for you to get disappointed, are much higher! While I'm not entirely aware of the complete Holmes universe, I can say that movies have branded an image of Mr. Holmes into my mind, that is quite different than the Robert Downey Jr. one ... Guy Ritchie points out, that he is truer to the source material (the books) by his depictions of Holmes and Watson. Watson being also quite different, from the simple 'side-kick' that he was, into being Jude Law in this one!Depending on how well you can cope with those changes and with the fact, that this is a thrill ride, it's up to you, how much you can and will enjoy this movie. Robert Downey is amazing as always and the chemistry between him and Jude Law is pitch-perfect. Throw an amazing Rachel McAdams into the mix, with a nice villain and police chief with some weight (no pun intended) and you got yourself a nice action adventure, with a detective story.",8,0,1,27 March 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," When the human's away, the pets will play
","You may have heard this with cats and mice instead of humans and pets. But the allegory is what this movie is about. Actually if you saw the trailer you know the overall premise even without reading anything more about it. If you ever had a pet you probably were wondering if there is more to their life and what they were doing while you didn't look. This movie wants to show you what you were missing.Well obviously this isn't real and I'm not only talking about the fact it is animated. It also tries to give us more than just the on punchline and all the jokes we've already seen in the trailer. Which is nice, but overall you can say this is a very uneven affair. Still it strong enough to keep kids entertained and adults should have their fair share of fun too. Never mind the convoluted story and any other mess you'll most likely see - just enjoy the hyper active bunny and the rest of the crew.",7,0,0,25 February 2017
WALL·E," They did it again
","Apart from Cars (which as I heard will get a sequel, surprisingly for me at least), every movie Pixar made until this point in time, was at least excellent, imho. And even Cars, was still pretty good, just never hit as high, as the other ones did. WALL-E is proof yet again, that there is only one true animation champ! Yes there are other good, funny animated movies, from other studios, but only Pixar has a strong enough story to mix with all the little jokes. Only they can appeal to a young audience and a mature one. Wall-E seems like a strange idea. Something that might not get you emotional involved (the main characters are derived of many facial expressions, due to the fact, that they are robots and are lacking some facial similarity to a human being. Yes there are the eyes, but many other things are absent. Not that you would want to have it any other way. The movie is pretty silent (especially in the first part of the movie), but you still get attached to this robot being.There are many in-jokes for the mature audience, a message delivered with the right notes and many other funny things, that makes WALL-E one of the best movies. Not only in 2008, but overall.",10,2,4,30 January 2009
The Good Shepherd," Fighting your inner Damon
","More than a decade after Bronx Tale (an impressive debut film as director) De Niro comes with his sophomore picture. A big one by all means. That's not only the running time (nearly 3 hours), but also the cast (for details look on the IMDb site or the trailer for this movie, also found here on this page somewhere) and the beginning/birth of the CIA! Spy business has nothing to do with emotions and that is what you are getting here (although Matt Damon's character does have empathy and does trust people, for better or worse). But you will also feel emotionally detached from the characters, too. And that is one of the few points that I have to criticize. Because overall it's a good movie! One other thing being the running time. I can't say where something should've been cut out, but it is a very long movie (although mind you, shorter running-time movies have felt longer to me).The story is told through a the course of a couple of decades and is going back & forth in time. Which is handled very nicely by the script & De Niro. Although it might be confusing in the beginning, you will understand what's going on as the time progresses! If the 3 hrs. running time don't bother you, than watch the movie, it's worth your while! Matt your spy yet?",7,1,3,18 April 2007
Finding Dory," Going away
","This is a really good sequel. Taking characters from the first one and putting new ones in there as well, it never gets boring or seems to repetitive. And you don't even have to be Dory, I mean forgetful, for this to work for you. Yes it does make sense to watch the first one (Finding Nemo) then, although I reckon you could watch it and enjoy it as a standalone too.The characters and their traits are strong and there are a lot of side jokes built in to this too. Humans are being treated like extras and we wouldn't have the time to deal with them anyway. That is apart from one major voice - but it's being highlighted too as if one of the writers or Ellen herself might have a crush there. But you can't blame them for that. On the contrary you can congratulate everyone involved for a really good movie",8,28,39,12 June 2017
Arrival," Slow burning Science Fiction
","If you are looking for flashy, loud and generally speaking fast paced action Science Fiction: This is not the one you are looking for (no pun intended). But if you like slow, lingering and long shots, a movie that takes time to breathe and gives an epic scale to it's framing and cinematography, you could do a lot worse.I'm being a bit modest concerning the movie of course, because we're talking about a very well written script, that has a few surprises along the way and warrants more than one viewing and things to discover on those repeat viewings. It is really well acted and it has a story that is gripping as well as interesting from start to finish. The title alone suggests something, even if you haven't seen the trailer (which I didn't) - so you are in a way more prepared than our characters. But at the same time on their level ... So many Questions and not all get answered (at least not while watching it for the first time)",10,1,7,18 June 2017
The Blind Side," Fairy tale
","If you are cynic, you might wanna steer clear of this. On the other hand, I like to be cynic here and there, and I still did quite enjoy this movie. It's not the best movie ever (far from it), but as a feel good movie, with a hint of danger here and there (and actually an upset that is almost ridiculous), it works very good. Performances are more than stellar too.I haven't seen all the movies that came out in 2009 in America to qualify for the best actress award, but I guess the theme of the movie, helped Sandra win this one. Don't get me wrong, she is pretty good in the movie. But it's the overall impact of the whole thing, that made her win (is my guess).While it might also be the TV movie of the week, the naturalistic approach by our main actor does upgrade it quite a bit. His down to earth character works really well ... unless you think real conflict is missing in the movie ...",7,1,2,7 October 2010
Parasite," Not a leech (?)
","Of course Parasite could be anything ... which is why you should avoid Spoilers at all costs. Many have made a point about this and they are right. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, you want to talk about everything. Performances, story and all of it.If you don't mind the subtitles go for it. I am expecting there to be an American remake anytime soon. So watch it before it becomes a thing. Especially now with the Golden Globes win and Oscar recognition (both deservedly!). South Korean cinema especially concerning drama and thrillers is really something I can advise anyone to watch. The quality is high and there are many things to discover. Not to mention they deliver surprises for anyone watching ... which is a good point for this movie too!",10,22,35,15 January 2020
Rango," Skin I live in
","I only watched the version that ran in the cinemas, so I can't comment on the extended Edition that is available on Disc. I personally liked the fact, that the movie didn't follow the trend to go 3-D (though you never know what 'clever' marketing people will do in the future). I also liked the fact that the movie is goofy but also deep when it comes to its main character (spoken by none other then Johnny Depp).A great main character is always helping, but you also need good supporting characters. And you got them here too. While the story may unfold pretty much as you would expect it to, what will stay with you are the characters. And hopefully some of the jokes too.",7,0,0,14 December 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Former Superstar
","It might only be one shot (actually more than one shot, but the movie flows as if there is no cut in it and it works nicely, even if you can imagine where they made some of the cuts), but there are so many layers to it, that it warrants repeat viewing. Obviously only if you liked it. I can understand that some might find this 'boring' or not interesting enough, especially if you don't care or don't make connections like Michael Keaton having played 'Batman' and knowing about being famous once (and a super hero for that matter).So if that doesn't float your boat, forget about the rest. Just relax with the 'worst movie ever' sayings. That'd be nice, especially because it just doesn't fit. To be in that category the acting should be off and the technical aspect worse than a really bad student movie. But it isn't, it's the opposite. The story is actually gripping if you can get behind it, not to mention the relationships between the characters (what a cast by the way). I loved it, as my rating already suggests, but the quirky humor and the pacing will not be everyones taste. No matter what the Academy said, it's your taste that decides if this is for you.Finally: The End - what you make of it, is entirely up to you (pun intended)",10,0,3,21 June 2015
Centurion," History (re)written
","So the movie is based on a historical fact apparently. If you know that one little fact, that you kind of know where this is heading. Res assured I unfortunately had read about it, in a review. Why they bother spoiling major plot details in reviews like that, even if it is written down in history, I will never know. You can write that it is based on that and that and therefor a re-telling of that story, without revealing the outcome.Having said that, there might be a surprise or two for those who know (or think they do?) how this ends. There are quite a few good actors working on this movie and everyone gets his/her moment to shine. Still it is Michael Fassbender who carries the movie. And while our main female protagonist is not 'saying' much, she is still a good/decent enough villain to pull us in as viewers.",7,2,6,4 November 2010
The Big Short," Getting the short end
","Although many would argue the end is not in sight. Not for a long time it won't be. Especially if nothing changes in America concerning politics. But that would be stretching it now. The movie just makes it even more important to know what you vote and why you vote for it. What happened in America (and what is surely still happening to at least a degree) caused an earthquake which rippled all over the world.Financial crisis still roaming in some countries. Not that those countries didn't 'help' by making bad choices themselves too. But it's amazing what banks are still allowed to do and how they won't ever will be made responsible for their mistakes (unless a politician finally steps up and makes them - of course that man or woman would have to be elected president first).But back to this movie, with its weird mix of comedy and cold hard facts. It's tough to laugh at times and it's tough to understand the whole picture too. Which is why we get interludes with famous people playing themselves, explaining important plot points (or rather real life incidents/information) for the viewer to be able to actually get behind it all.The fourth wall is broken a lot, the movie tells us the whole time what is up. It's also telling is from time to time, that events didn't exactly occurred as presented, making fun of the process itself. It might be too clever for its own good, or at least in the perception of some viewing, who might have preferred a more straight/head-on approach. But if you dig what they did here, you'll get an excellent movie nonetheless",8,0,1,3 June 2016
The Conjuring," The horror
","It's not easy to do a really good horror movie nowadays. You've seen most of it anyways, so what can they bring that excites you and terrifies you? Is there anything? Well in this case here, there are known ingredients and you might see where this is going, but it still feels fresh. Plus it does have great actors in it.I don't want to say that low budget movies with non-actors are bad in general, but having people who actually can convey feelings and can pull off things, that might seem weird to say the least helps a lot. Of course there is always doubt when it comes to ghost or poltergeist movements and maybe you are not one who is easily convinced either. Don't let the 'Based on real events' tag get to you though ... this is good",8,1,2,19 May 2014
Platoon," No prisoners ...
","That's what the movie does with you and anyone who watches it. There is a kind of no-holds barred feeling to it. And it's more than believable coming from a man who's been there (Vietnam) and has done his time ...Oliver Stone sure knows how to make a movie about war, especially one about the Vietnam war. Although he was a somewhat acclaimed writer before Platoon (think of the Scarface script he did for Brian De Palma), this movie marked his real beginning to cult director and known celebrity. And this movie or the making of it is filled with beautiful trivia, which you can find here at IMDb. But even without those stories, it's a remarkable film, that anyone who has the slightest interest in war movies should watch! Nuff said! :o)",9,1,2,4 April 2007
Scream," Scary Movie
","Of course Scary Movie was the working title of this Wes Craven vehicle, which got hijacked by the Wayans to make their spoof of this (and other Horror movies of that time). Craven also had made the latest (til then that is) Nightmare movie, called 'New Nightmare'. It was the first one that got into the whole 'we are aware this is a movie, while we're doing it', but wasn't as successful as the Scream movies became. Even though it was a success in America it did take almost a year to come out in Germany for example.And while the movie 'plays' with rules and has fun with it, it is also pretty scary. Of course friends of mine didn't like the fact, that it tried to be funny and scary. Some people like their horror movies to be straight and not fourth-wall breaking. But this one is really a great example how to do it. It also helped Kevin Williamson to become famous (at least for awhile, he worked with Robert Rodriguez - Faculty) and Wes Craven to be 'hot' once again.As you can see, I have not really written anything about the movie yet. I won't really tell you what it is about, but I will dare you to watch it, if you dig horror comedies. Hopefully before you watch the spoof that is called 'Scary Movie' ...",8,7,8,16 October 2011
Prometheus," Different beast
","First of all you shouldn't compare this too much with the original Alien. It is actually a good thing that this is different. I wouldn't like it any other way. The fact that Mr. Damon Lindelof co-wrote the script might be an indicator that you're not going to get all the answers here. On the other hand, it was stated that this might be the beginning of a new trilogy or at least 'saga'.Another thing that has been criticized is the scientific accuracy of the movie. But apart from the fact, that this is another society that might have other values, other standards than we know. Even if not, this is still a movie and things happen in here that are not 'true' to what we know (especially in genre like Science Fiction!).Onto the positive things. Visually this is more than stunning. Especially the beginning left me wide eyed. That was incredible. You may not like the movie as it is, but can't fault the technical achievements. I liked the acting too and I for once also liked the story. It isn't a genius concept, but it works more than nicely for the movie.One of the most memorable scenes from 'Alien' gets mirrored here and it has to be seen to be believed. It really has a similar impact. Another kind of beast this is indeed, but it still is a very great one",9,5,13,1 August 2012
Halloween," My brothers keeper (not)
","So watching this again after a long time (it was a double bill with the new Halloween from 2018) refresehed my memory in a good way. First of all the movie really aged well. I was a bit surprised about the nudity and all the teenage talk in general, but most of all I was surprised to see that Jamie Lee's character was or rather is not the sister of the killer.That is clear pretty early on in the movie and something that would 'change' in the sequels. Now having that out of the way and a very violent POV beginning, this really stirs things up. The original music that is so famous, even people who haven't seen the movie know it, is giving viewers a chill. And while the hairdos actually may be the one thing that has aged, the performances are really good. This is a classic for a reason, even if it may have the occasional flaw",8,0,0,3 May 2019
The Water Diviner," Kept promises (?)
","Russell Crowe has been directed by many good and qualified directors, so by now he must have picked up on many of things. Which I reckon can be seen in his directorial debut. Would it have been better if he had just concentrated on one thing though? Tough to say, especially because it does not seem to affect his acting in the movie at least. The direction on he other hand ... that's up for discussion, unless you argue it was the script that needed improvements.Having said all that, the movie is emotional and it does take you on a (literal) journey. It also seems very strong on making a point in showing gray areas in war and laying out blame. To a certain degree that is, because you do get some 'bad people' to, which is a shame and not consistent to what the message should be about. Not to mention an overly dramatic ending, that really was unnecessary. Other than that, this was more than a decent film debut",6,1,3,12 June 2016
Wonder Woman," I wonder ... Woman
","Not me of course, though I do admit I was wondering if this was going to be any good. DC did not have the best record concerning building up their universe, so skepticism was not really out of the ordinary. But the movie proved me wrong and made a lot of things right. And it's really nice that it's the Wonder Woman movie to kick off that trend. I know some will either cherish that and others will hate it - just try to leave the feminism discussion out of it.And enjoy a movie that really captures the making of a superhero. Wonder Woman rising in the best sense. There still are some hurdles that are tough to overcome. The main villain for example has his issues, but for every thing that may not work 100% you have twice or three times as many other things that are really good. Take Chris Pine for example: I wasn't sure if this was necessary casting ... but it very much was. You needed someone who could hold his own. And Gal Gadot really is amazing in this. Looks and beauty aside, she really pulled her weight acting wise.",8,17,34,2 September 2017
Despicable Me," Anything but despicable!
","An animated feature that is not from Pixar, but is still really good? Yes it can happen! Despicable me might not have the values and depth of the movie 'Up' or other Pixar movies, but on entertainment value alone this does not have to hide behind any other movie. I was a bit skeptical, but the movie really got to me.Steve Carrell is adorable rather than frightening. And he does manage to walk the line between being cruel and a bit mean, but also still a nice and warm character. Kudos for writing him like that, but also for his voice performance (he does have an accent you see, one of his specialties apparently).You might have seen quite a few scenes in the trailer, but there is still quite a few things to discover in the movie itself. Fun and light, but still with a few punches here and there. Sweet and sour so to speak. Open yourself up to the movie and you will relish the experience!",9,1,1,30 December 2010
Carrie," Film novel
","I haven't read all of Stephen Kings books and Carrie is one of those I have missed. But this movie even without being able to compare it to the book, does a very fine job. It does give you a sense of isolation and it does give you a powerhouse performance by it's lead actress. A horror movie that is scary.Even though it's from the 70s and there has been a really solid remake, this is really worth watching. I myself always try to watch the original first, before going ahead to watch any remake, but I would understand if some don't have the time or patience to do that. There are differences though and you get an ending here, that you won't be able to forget soon ... unless someone told you about it ...",8,3,4,13 June 2014
Marriage Story," Live together, being apart or Kramer vs Kramer reboot
","The movie is brutaly honest and feels brutaly real. I don't condone everything being said or done. By neither of the two main characters. But motivations are clear and the story is really well told. The drama unfolds and it does not seem to be made up, rather really slow burning and quite reasonable (well as reasonable as some of the things can be).Having said all that, the performances really are something. Both leads have their say and while we seem to stay focused on the man mostly, both have winning arguments. As I already have suggested in my summary line, this can be viewed as a modern day Kramer vs. Kramer movie. Not sure if that is what they set out to do or thought of, but I only mean it in the best possible way. This really brings home certain things, even if you never lived them",9,6,8,5 February 2020
Blow," No Blow
","Or should it be yes Blow? Not to confuse though, the movie is good. And I wasn't surprised overall, but after a quite mediocre beginning, the movie did find a grip to hold me and entertain me until the end. Yes there have been quite a few movies that have a similar storyline, a similar structure of a man and his rise into crime, fame and/or money.It's amazing to not just see Johnny Depp in a way more serious role and far removed from his Captain Jack Sparrow persona, but also someone like Ray Liotta, really downplaying and being as subtle as can be. Generally speaking the movie is very well cast and has a true story as a background to hold up anything it is telling us. Of course exaggerations are made, though I'm not too familiar with what actually happened to point these things out. The disc version (New Line did a thing called Infini Film, which I thought was quite cool) has a lot of background info for you to dive into though, if interested.",9,0,0,24 May 2020
Taken 2," Take 2
","If you didn't like the first Taken, do not bother watching this. If you did like it, it doesn't necessarily mean you will like this though. I only watched the watered down version (no pun intended), which is the theatrical version aka as PG-13 version. So maybe the other one achieves to be as gritty (or almost as) as the original. But there are quite a few things here, that just don't fit.Take the hand grenade scene. Now if you thought the first one was offensive and stupid, I wonder what you'd say about that! I might be missing the 'fun' it makes of itself or the prior installment. But I just can't seem to find it. While even McGuyver would go 'Duh', Liam Neeson does save the movie from going completely down. Plus a very nice scene towards the end is really good and almost tops a similar 'themed' scene from Eastern Promises.At least his daughter gets to do more than in part 1. Still I miss the grittiness of the Original ... be aware of that and you might be able to enjoy it even more than I did",5,1,1,13 April 2013
Straight Outta Compton," Straight Outta Memes
","Even if you had no idea who NWA is (or what those initials stand for, be careful, you might be offended by it!), you will after watching this. What you won't get much out of this, is how some things came to be. This is not getting too much into the mindset or the making off (producing) songs or writing lyrics. You'll get the end results - and there is one song in particular, that is high on the 'diss-scale' and as funny as it could be (especially considering the history).But this is a movie and it's more interested in showing you were characters are coming from and where they go/went. Performances are great and unfortunately 2015 showed us, that some of the things that were happening back then are still relevant (and are still happening). If 22 Jump Street (and Queen Latifahs reply to where she's from), was your first contact - then be prepared to be amazed.There is a lot of evil stuff happening and there is a lot of bad characters or at least bad choices. Some things never get fully explained or fleshed out, but there wouldn't be enough time for that. As it is (and having watched the extended Version already), this is a good if packed music Bio, with some very good music in it! Some things are surely comprised, I can't imagine everything happen exactly as shown, but the 'jist' of it is surely right. So most 'issues' the movie might have, are in it's time constraints ... but it does make the best of it!",9,5,32,12 January 2016
Step Up," Step up (in the right direction)
","There were musicals and then there are Dance movies. Which I guess could be considered the new musicals. Bollywood seems to be doing OK with them. And while in movies like Step up, there is a reason for dancing (other than walking down the street), the idea seems to always find a crowd of people wanting to watch. Why? Maybe because they either would love to be able to do the stuff they see on screen, maybe because of the love story, maybe because of the songs.The answer lies within the viewers of said movies. But if you have to kick-start a franchise (other than getting money online for your idea that is), than there could've been worse ways than this. Channing Tatum in his breakout role, dancing yet not stripping on film. The romance and the basic story is simple and predictable, but the two leads (who have ever since been married) really sell it ... guess the chemistry was real there ...",6,0,0,30 April 2016
The Woman in Black," Kids
","Daniel Radcliffe is practically still a child, but he has to play a father in this movie. Another Hammer film, that finally seems to have a good one under its belt (if you take Let me in out of the equation that is, so let's say a unique good one). Hammer films came back, but it didn't seem to really take off. With this one it could change (if people will accept it, when it comes out on DVD and Blu Ray).To solve the mystery: Daniel R. is good in his role, the fact that his godson played his kid helped a lot I reckon. Also it's a nice change of pace for Ciaran Hinds. He's a good actor, but can play it mellow for once, instead of going all out (he was rather mellow in Rome, I meant his movie roles). Some nice shockers and a really nice story make this a worthwhile watch",7,0,0,10 May 2012
Shrek," Shrek-tastic
","Shrek tries to take apart every cliché that Disney and other animated pictures have build upon. And for the most part it works that way. Unfortunately they do not stay true to that formula, heading back and using those same clichés as the story moves along. But on the other hand, does it make this a bad movie? Of course not. And you would have to a very bitter cynic to not like it at all I guess. Or not like animated movies in the first place. Taste is different, so maybe there are other reasons too. I can only tell you, that the voice talent on hand, the animation and the story as it is, are really good. I don't like to refer to Pixar, because it is unfair to every other animated picture ... but again this does not mean I didn't enjoy it. It's a fun little picture for the whole family",7,0,2,23 October 2010
Saints and Soldiers," War is a battlefield
","Actually not just one. Also some may argue, that filmmaking is a battlefield too. So I reckon there is some poetry in that this is another example of a marriage of both those things combined. A movie about a few soldiers that find themselves in quite the .. situation.After the beginning and their more or less succesful attempt to escape the Nazis, they have to be on their way to find the allied troop/friends. Not an easy task at all. Quite the ordeal actually and quite the 'road' movie for the viewer to endure with the main characters. On the Blu Ray I own, there are three seperate commentaries, one by the filmmakers, one by the actors and one by actual soldiers if I got the last one right. Surely an interesting listen all of them. The movie gives a lot to discuss and is very well made, if you are into this kind of thing.",8,0,0,6 June 2020
X-Men: First Class," Marks the Beginning
","After Matthew Vaughn refused a prior X-Men movie, he finally came and made this one. And it seems like he made the right decision. He had more to say in this, then he would have had in the earlier one. Still even as it is, there are of course a few things to be considered (timeline-wise) and even I could see and smile about a few nods to things/nods to future happenings.It has be said, that this is a stand-alone and has not that much to do with the other X-Men movies. But since I am not that aware of the comics I can only compare it to the other movies. And this is definitely a very good entry into the series (and ties can still be found, with one particular cameo that was just really funny).Apart from the coherent story and nice build up (even if you can see where it is going and you probably will), the other thing that makes this movie special, are the actors. Top notch casting with some heavyweight actors put into the mix. Highly recommended, even if you're not that much into comic movies ...",9,0,1,9 January 2012
Fifty Shades of Grey," Easy prey
","This movie is easy to take apart. It seems to try to steer away from some of the ridiculous things the book included (from what I have read in reviews and other things, because I haven't read it, I think watching the movie was 'enough'). Still as many have observed there is no chemistry here between the leads. On one hand it's nice to see 'romantic' movie steer away from certain things, on the other hand, it just a shallow diversion, that actually isn't one.You get the same things (read clichés) that you get in your plain romantic comedy. Just without the comedy! Which is a factor that is sorely missed here. No matter how bad those were, you at least had some funny scenes here and there. The funny things here consist of stroking (which is supposed to be hitting?). And while it's nice to see a powerful female character, the transition of 'plain Jane' to super woman/healer/confident character does not bode well.Obviously there is a lot of nudity, a lot of longing looks and a lot of dialog that will make you cringe and (maybe even) whine at times. It still isn't as bad as expected, but that's not saying very much. The 'helping' a 'poor' soul excuse is also a masquerade that is as awful as it sounds. Obviously only works with attractive people (which goes both ways no matter the gender)",3,2,5,14 June 2015
The Wolverine," Waking the animal inside
","And putting him to sleep too, if you will. You've probably seen the trailer, but even if not, the movie itself is very predictable. You don't have to think too much to come up with what is going to happen. But the movie is still a lot of fun to watch. Has character moments and seems to be detached from the other Wolverine movie. Which means you don't have to have seen that.It actually does tell a sort of stand alone story. And since I'm not very familiar with the comic books I can't tell you, how close this is to them. Or if this is something that spans more than one story in the books or is made up. What I can tell you, is that it looks amazing and our hero does find himself in a predicament, that he himself created. Hugh Jackman is amazing once again",7,3,5,1 September 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Final Conclusion
","I have to admit from the beginning that I was not an avid Batman Comic reader. So this review will not have any comparisons with that 'world'. And I try to distinguish that from the start, because you have to accept (if you want to enjoy the movie) that Nolan did create something different from the components the Batman universe gave him to play with and made it work.Of course this other world does seem to be more grounded in reality (as much as is possible) and couldn't be compared to what normally is a comic book movie. That's either a good or a bad thing, depending on your view of things. Only thing I might not agree with entirely is Marion Cottilard. While I like her, I think someone else should have been in the movie instead of her. You might understand after you watch the movie.I really like the conclusion and while the previous movie (The Dark Knight) seems a bit better at this point of time, the third Nolan Batman movie has a lot to offer too. Of course the 'reboot' is in the works already and we will get another Batman soon. Spiderman showed it does work and is successful too. Tom Hardy is not as charismatic as Heath Ledger, but he doesn't have to be. Hope you're watching it on a good sound system, because his voice could be a bit hard to understand if not.The number of IMAX scenes have been increased and the movie looks incredible. I also had the feeling that the fight scenes (while not the best choreographed), look a lot better on the IMAX screen than on the regular one.Unfortunately the movie might be associated by some (even when time passes) with two things: The shooting in a theater during a screening (which led to another movie being delayed due to the fact it had a cinema shootout - Gangster Squad) and the Bane/Bain discussion, summing up some republicans and democrats using this movie as propaganda. Hopefully you'll see this as entertainment (as Nolan intended it to be) and like it too.",9,2,7,7 September 2012
The Croods," Very light family entertainment
","Finally a role for Nicolas Cage where he's not completely crazy. Only a little bit! And it's a light movie, which is a difference in tone too. It's some great voices that are working on this and the movie itself does not disappoint. If you're not looking for Pixar perfection that is. Because we get something that just is a simple animated family movie, nothing more, nothing less.But as we have been spoiled of late, with movies that go beyond that, it might seem little to some people. As do the characters from our past. I also wouldn't try to compare this with the Flintstones in any way. This is an entirely different beast. The story is predictable as are most of the jokes, but it's fun to watch (also in 3D)",7,0,0,12 August 2013
Black Panther," Once you go ... Panther
","Actually that is not entirely true, because you can go back. Then again that would not rhyme with Panther anyway. And not you as in you but Chadwick who ... well you'll know what I mean once you've seen the movie. But back to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I am really still surprised that people who loathe what Marvel has done, go and watch the movies and just see what they already made up their mind they will get served in the first place.I'd say this has an original take to it. I do understand if you say they feel the same to you. If that is the case, don't bother watching them. Also I'm still surprised there are people out there who still haven't figured out there are stingers at the end of the movie. During and after the credits - stay tuned folks. Now another small incident that I witnessed that occured was when a couple came out of the movie an hour into it and upon me asking them if they were alright, they said they didn't like the movie. Fair enough, we all like different things. Someone else asked them why though ... and their answer was that it was racist and cliche. Two white people claiming to know what black people think? Yep that surely must be the wrong side of 'woke'.Enjoy a movie that is more than just a movie. It was made and became a phenomenon. Now besides the 'Tolkien white guys' (a joke that was made on set apparently, according to one of the two white guys in the movie, Martin Freeman), this gives us a movie made under the helm of Marvel but creatively they put a lot of trust into their director. And this was something that touched a nerve in the public - rightfully so. Because apart from having a predominantly black cast (and director), this also is a very entertaining and good movie.The movie itself gives us a closer look behind the mythology of the Panther. And it is quite interesting. There are a few hiccups along the ride, but the movie works overall. And it adds to the 'universe'. Those movies are supposed to be light and fun ... but they still can carry a small political message. Both are not mutually exclusive",8,5,13,14 April 2018
Any Given Sunday," Any given Pacino ...
","Not really, but it's also not any movie we got here! It's again an Oliver Stone movie. So controversy is around the corner. Although not as edgy as some of his other offerings, this still shows his skills as storyteller.It's doesn't hurt that he has great actors playing in the lead roles either. And while most people knew Pacino back then, no one could have anticipated that Jamie Foxx (of Booty Call fame, which I liked, but it's not exactly a movie you'd print top of your CV List! ;o) ) would turn out to be as good as he was ... At least no one from the movie going audience couldn't, I'm pretty sure that Stone knew what he had gotten himself into! Those are just the two top names, but when you read the name list here on IMDb you'll find many familiar names! (that is unless you are reading this in 100 years from now, you might not know anybody, but then again I'll probably won't be around for you to curse on me! ;o) I just realised that I didn't even mention yet, that this movie is about football. But then again it's about so much more than football ... Stone again criticizes anything/everything he can ... on top of that he has a really disgusting scene (I'm pretty sure you'll get your eye on it), not for any particular reason, but just 'cause he's Oliver Stone and he might wanted to remind you that! Still as I said, something is still missing, so that I can't give it full 10 points. A good movie indeed! I hope you'll like it as much as I did!",8,0,1,6 April 2007
Iron Man," Great performances
","I have to state, that I'm not an avid comic(graphic novel) book reader, so I can't point out any differences between the written (or drawn) world and the real (filmed) world. But I know that this movie was a lot of fun and it seems to owe many things to Batman Begins ... beginning with an ensemble cast!But the main actor here is of course Robert Downey Jr. If you have followed his career & private life (some ups, unfortunately many 'downs' too, no pun intended), you have to be real happy seeing him getting recognized for his talent and finally beginning to explore his (acting) abilities and being confident enough to play major roles. This is apparent through the screen/his acting. He is very comfortable (not only because of the 'support' cast, that ... supports him, Terence Howard, Gwyneth P. and Jeff B.) and this helps elevate the movie! It is fun & light, but with an honest message/warning (just like Mr. Downey himself)",8,1,3,12 August 2008
Mother!," Many ways ... many views ... many feelings
","You can tell by how people react to reviews on this, that they have made up their mind. The director himself likes the fact the movie does not leave people without emotions. Be it joy for liking it or hate for disliking it. Even strong annoyance if you feel that hate is too strong a word is well received. And we also know that the director does have a tendency to go religious on us.That is not a bad thing but it may be helpful for the viewer who want to know what is going on. Or want answers! They are sort of written down ... in a book. But this is not just the making of ... this can also be seen as an allegory on many other things. And Darren is not someone who'd squash anyones view on the matter. He said he made one movie, but he welcomes any other interpretation. And there is a lot to discover.If you are open and receiving for the way the movie tells its story, for the way the characters behave (because they can be pretty annoying, especially out of context, but even if you get certain things, it'll be pretty stressing to see certain things happen) ... with certain life experiences, different feelings may arise while watching. That's why everyone watches a different movie (subjectively speaking). Yet there are so many universal themes (or even otherworldly?) in it, that there should be something for everybody.Again slow pacing and agonizing horror are front and center. Though almost nothing can prepare you for that last part of the movie. Then again I wouldn't want it any other way myself. I was at the edge of my seat - even when I was frustrated by things happening. A movie that dares you to think all the time and is made for multiple viewings. And for a movie that is aiming for head/brain rather than the heart, it is able to get quite a lot of emotion from anyone watching ...",10,0,5,31 December 2017
Creed II," Drago(nian) measures
","The uber villain from the Rocky franchises returns. Whoever watched the original Rocky movies will not forget Ivan Drago - also known as Dolph Lundgren in real life with an amazing performance that is literally as 1 dimensional as possible and still or rather because of that is in one of the best Rocky movies made. So it makes sense for him to return here and to reprise his iconic role, training his son to take on Creed.Dumbing down again (evil as evil can be), he brings gravitas to the movie. Which does not quite reach the heights of the first Creed, but still is quite enjoyable. Especially with all the history contained in the movie. This should be a worthy closure to the Rocky saga - but you never know, do you?",7,3,3,8 May 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Ultimate Justice
","It may Dawn on some, that this is darker than your average Marvel movie (yes pun intended). And whomever watches this, can decide (be the Jury) and do this movie a justice of his or her own. But enough of the puns, because while the Suicide Squad at least looks like it will be funny (still dark hopefully), this has almost no fun at all. Unless you count a writing on the wall in Latin, where Snyder makes fun of the Watchmen (or rather his own take/movie of it, probably).Of course that and some other things may go over the head of some. And if you haven't seen the extended cut, my understanding is that the movie will make less sense. So I did only watch the 3 hours cut. And it was OK. But while Batman (and Affleck is the best thing in this, period!) is brooding and he is supposed to be that way, Superman at least should be much more than a mope ... Also there is not enough Batman in here. But I am excited about the Batman standalone movie. Visually of course Gal Gadot is stunning. When she opens her mouth on the other hand ... well let's just say you'll either find her accent enticing or ridiculous. (Un)Fortunately she doesn't have that much to say.Her training paid off though, and the action scenes are really good. But we didn't expect anything less from a Zack Snyder movie. The major issue here (apart from the missing lightness, it's just too heavy and too serious for its own good), is that it has major plot holes and major logical errors (why did you say that name ... really? First of all you would state the relationship rather than a name in a situation like this and not the first name of the person you're trying to save, second of all: Really?). While not funny, there are many moments that are clearly ridiculous to say the least ... I really wanted to like this more. Especially because of the beating it got by the critics ... but foreshadowing aside, if you watch the Honest Trailer for this, it will be an eye opener!",6,0,2,8 August 2016
Blade Runner," Existing
","This (as well as the sequel out in cinemas right now) are very existential. And for a Science Fiction movie, this holds up more than just well. I re-watched it recently (two of the multiple cuts) and the visuals are still stunning, eve more so if you consider the 35 plus years that have passed since this was made (and then released).But you can't reduce this just to the visuals, it is about humanity, it is about existence, it is about many questions all woven into the story of Deckard, who is out to 'retire' Replicants. Harrison Ford has some impressive CV and this is not just another notch in the belt. I remember also vaguely playing the PC game sometimes in the 90s. It was really good though had nothing to do with the movie itself.Many have interpreted this in many different ways. Especially with all the endings out there. Ridley Scott gives an insight into what he was out in his audio commentary. And if you can get the complete set, with an exhaustive amount of extras do so. Also do watch the sequel on a big screen (IMAX preferably)",8,0,4,11 October 2017
Bruce Almighty," Some laugh out loud moments
","Quite some few I'd say. The pairing of Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman seems to be a genius one. Throw in Steve Carell for good measure (and a beautiful newscast scene, where Jim Carreys character is 'playing' him) and you're good to go.The story(line) is simple and there's not much to it. Still it takes some time to take off, maybe too much, while introducing all the characters and some of Bruce's (Jim C.) flaws. But overall you can't stop wondering, what's wrong with this guy. I mean he kind of has it all and still isn't satisfied. While that might be acceptable as a fact, any other actor might have had much more problems selling this to the audience. Even Jim quite can't hold this up. But maybe, I'm thinking too much ... my niece, her brother and their friends really enjoyed this ... so there you go. A family comedy that does deliver!",6,0,0,10 October 2007
Monsters University," Back to school
","Or the university that is. And while the movie has clichés in it like you wouldn't believe, the movie is still more than enjoyable! The voice cast is amazing as always, but it's still Pixar crafting the characters and the story that while having a morality to it, it never feels like a boring lesson (pun intended).So this works as a sort of prequel to the other movie (Monsters Inc.). That means there is no need to have watched the first movie. But even if you haven't, after watching this you will want to watch it either way. And it holds up to the first movie quite good. Like always (apart maybe from Cars) you know what you're getting with Pixar ... Quality!",8,0,0,30 August 2013
Ben-Hur," Extra Large but without french fries
","If you don't get the summary joke or hate me because of it, I can't change that. Why I chose it though? I'll come back to that in a second, but let's start: For the sheer scope of the movie you have to love it. By scope I mean the photography (beautiful pictures) and the sound (a fantastic sound design, that could be used to teach students about film music). All this though has to work as a whole. And it does work. It's a good movie and because of it's length and the quality of it's production it's regarded as one of the classic movies of all times.Call it sacrilege though, but I do have some objections to that. Yes it is a fine movie (after all I gave it a 7/10, which is pretty good in my book, although far away from great), but it is just too darn long! And that is where my summary line/reference comes into play. And although we're following Ben Hur, there's a very big side story (the title of the movie was originally named after 'that side story' too). And although the similarities in both the sub- and main plot are evident it just makes the whole thing longer ... Epic movie it is then, in all the meanings that there are. An essential movie to watch, but afterwards don't be afraid to say that you thought it was too long!",7,3,8,8 January 2008
Casino Royale," Not a bond as you might remember/know him
","If I look at this movie and think of it as a 'simple' spy movie, I'd say it was very good! I'd give it at least 8/10, I even think it could've made me give it 9. But it's not just a simple spy movie. It's Bond. And it pretty much messes with the history of Bond movies ... or as many said: Bond begins! There's nothing wrong with trying new things. But apart from the shaken/stirred discussion (or better not caring about it, hello?), one of the things that got me off, was the casting of Judi Dench as 'M'. Why? Not because she's bad in the role, but because you feel cheated, all in sake of political correctness. Or as the makers said, because she was so good in this role. But by casting her, they obliterated everything that happened before (i.e. Sean Connerys Bond and so forth, why messing with that?).Those might only seem as small insignificant details (especially to new fans), but I didn't feel that way and since this is my review, I'm gonna talk about it! I didn't have a problem with the fact, that they tried to keep it as real as possible (down & dirty), although all this realism talk (Bond can get hurt, see the poison scene) get's thrown out of the window, when Bond single-handedly takes over a whole military base! I mean come on, what's so real about that? (I like the scenes though and it gives Bourne and other new spies a run for their money).There are many good things here, but I have to point out the biggest downfall of the movie (imho): The main villain! I really like the danish actor (Mads Mikkelsen), but he isn't a real thread here. He doesn't seem to, by even being harassed by others! How can you be afraid, if he can't keep his act together and even has to be rescued by Bond (or the movie would've been over quicker)?! It should've have been a much scarier villain! It didn't have to be a world conquering ego maniac, but a little more evil, wouldn't have hurt. But still after all these negative things, I still think the movie is good enough and maybe after watching the next Bond movie, I'll appreciate this one more!",7,0,1,9 May 2007
Toy Story 3," Playground
","First things first: This is hands down the best 3-D picture I have seen to this day (that's towards the end of 2010). And I have seen quite a few 3-D pictures! From Horror (Valentine, Final Destination) to Fantasy (Journey to...) and animation (Shrek 4). Ice Age (3-D) was almost equally enjoyable (for me), but Toy Story 3(-D) is just top notch! And all comes down to the fact, that you have a movie at the core. A story that will move you, a ride that will take you with it. And it works even if you have never heard of the characters before (or seen them for that matter). Of course there are a few inside jokes, that you will only get if you have seen the prior entries into the series (another but not the only reason to check out the other Toy Story movies).It's difficult to put your finger into, why Pixar is able to make movies for adults and children alike, that have a high quality too. It is not a coincidence, that Pixar waited until they had their story for the part 3, before they went ahead to make it. If rumors are true of some other story ideas (Disney almost developed the third part), than you can only be glad, they waited and made it just now.The story is so rich and the movie was one of the few times, I actually went to the cinemas a second time, to watch it again. I can only say: Thank you Pixar!",10,1,1,21 October 2010
Trainspotting," Re-Spotting
","T1 (if the sequel is called T2, than it's logical to call it that, no?) is now 21 years old. Even in America it's allowed to do anything in any state. Then again with the president they have at the moment anything is possible anyway. But back to this, which is as raw, tough and mental as you may remember it.I still haven't read the book this is based on, but the movie really lives up to the hype. If you haven't seen it yet, I reckon a double bill with the sequel is about to happen. It's actually something you should treat yourself with. And I'm saying this a day before going into the second movie, but anticipations could not be much higher. Than again, riffing on 'Terminator' with the T2 title shortening is a rather clever marketing plot. It also tells us: we will deliver a great sequel. And I believe they will. Will they be able to shock as they did with a couple of scenes in this one? That will be hard, especially a scene with a baby, the infamous toilet scene and much more is tough to beat ... which makes this such a great movie. A must see, if you don't mind anarchic over the top stories. That are aware of their moral obligations, but not preaching too much",8,1,2,16 February 2017
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Best 3-D movie yet!
","There have been quite a few movies in 3-D lately (and there are more to come), but at this moment (Pixars Up is not available to review yet), this is the best of them. It's not the effects, that make this movie wonderful. They are nice, but I'm sure there will be better ones shortly (like in the movie Avatar by James Cameron). It's the movie/the story itself that convinces! While the second Ice Age (movie), could be considered a bit of a letdown, this one picks right up and takes you along a great ride. There's not that much that you can accuse the movie of (one of the things might be, that you think Diego is underused), because it works nicely. The new main character that is introduced, is spoken by someone very famous in Great Britain .... Everything fits and the movie can be enjoyed by young audiences and older ones. Even Scrat gets something 'new' ... something he that is very familiar for us 'humans' in every aspect that he is living through it and therefor very funny.I can only recommend the movie to everyone! (Story-)Quality-wise it's just one step behind Pixar and that is something great to achieve! :o)",9,0,1,14 September 2009
Before Sunrise," Beginning
","Who'd have thunk back then, that this would spawn a trilogy? My guess is nobody. But the first movie was strong enough to have followers and believers in it. Apart from the setting and the two magnificent actors, we get treated to some wonderful dialog. Some great scenery as well and the one subject that rules most of our lives -> Love.Represented not only by a male and female, but also two different cultures. But it still never feels like this is a cliché or tries to get some cheap shots in to make you laugh. This feels genuine and as viewers we can and should appreciate that. So while this is not necessary watching, you should take a look at this before ... watching the sequels!",8,0,0,12 August 2013
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Life
","I have to point one thing out right from the start, without spoiling anything, but you might have heard something about a scene involving Penelope, Scarlett and Javier. Let me tell you, if that's your main reason for watching the movie, you will be disappointed. I didn't really expect anything from that scene, even though some magazines made a big deal out of it.I was surprised though to see another woman playing a major role in this movie. She's also playing a part in the 'Frost/Nixon' movie that came out in 2008. She's not only beautiful, but really talented. While she might not have a brand name as do the other two females playing here, she does hold the movie together.Another comment/user said, that the old Woody is back. Well let's just say, the weirdness factor really went up here. You have many loose ends, you have people acting strange (as they would in normal life too?), but most importantly: They talk a lot (mostly not saying as much as they talk)! If that's not your kind of movie, than you better stay away from this. I actually did like it :o)",7,1,5,26 April 2009
Identity," Right there! Where? There!
","Even if you have watched the movie, you might not understand my summary line. Still I hope to get a nodding smile from at least one person who has figured it out. Speaking of which, this is something that a lot to do with the movie at hand. If you haven't watched it yet, do yourself a favour, do not read too much about it, more than this is a thriller, with quite a few twists and story turns.You might not understand why some things are shown, right from the start, but you will come to understand as the movie progresses. The wickedly fantastic script does a great job in conveying dialogue, character and story. And it is delightful to see, that they could get good actors to be in the movie. It's one of the movies, that were entertaining from start to finish. (at least for me)",9,0,1,15 September 2010
Saving Mr. Banks," When Disney met Poppins
","Well not exactly for more than one reasons, but I do like that summary line, because it is about the story how the movie Mary Poppins came to be. There probably are some exaggerations, but during the end credits you can listen to a bit of the audio tape that was made during some of the discussions to make the movie.One thing that the poster with Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson does not show (before watching this I only knew the basic outline of the movie), is the actors involved with this. Be it Paul Giamati or in a really great performance - Colin Farrell. Actually he almost steals the movie (which shouldn't be a surprise for a few reasons too).The movie might set up the characters on different ends of a scale (like they couldn't be more removed and almost clichéd), but the actors make it more than work. This is a story that might make you weep or at least get you on an emotional ride",8,0,1,8 October 2014
Jojo Rabbit," Mein Film
","So Taika Waititi is an exceptional director and this is proof of that! I mean who'd take Hitler as an imaginary friend (source material is way more serious apparently, haven't read it) and not just run with it, no pun intended, but make a funny, engaging and heartfelt movie with it? Well the answer lies in front of you and is ready to be enjoyed.Although to be fair, there is not just enjoyment and there are quite a lot of scenes here that will make you cringe to say the least. It is not just about showing violence for what it is (explicit), but also finding a balance with the humor. There is a let's everyone say 'Heil' that seems to go forever, but the scene as akward as it is and seems, still works.JoJo Rabbit has a few things that happen in the background or are not really talked about (see Sam Rockwell and his ... 'hidden' love, which while obvious is never spoken out literaly) - there are so many little gems in this movie, handled with so much care and dignity, it really is amazing. I know and heard some be offended even before seeing it and never really plan to watch the movie - which is their loss I reckon, but better that way than being offended by something that is widely considered as being funny and as delicate as it can be",10,1,2,7 April 2020
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Animated animals
","I had the fortune to look behind the scenes of a 'puppet' movie. The work and dedication that has to into a production is incredible. To make it work, to give the 'items' (animals in this case) emotion and character is anything but easy. You have to care for them, laugh and maybe even cry with them.Something that this movie achieves so easily, it's almost frightening. Wes was not on set, but gave his ideas and opinions to the animators and they brought it to life. Many kudos to them, who admitted, not being used to work like that before. Great voice artist help elevate the really very good, fine dialogue further.A movie for almost everyone.",8,0,1,7 October 2010
Son of Saul," If they had actually filmed back then ...
","This movie is very devastating. Of course, when it comes to the Holocaust everything is devastating to watch. But the way this was created, with one character the camera follows around everywhere, this will drain almost everything out of the viewer. The feeling is real, the emotion is as real as it gets and it could not be more in your face if it went up someones nose.Of course that is not necessary, there are far more grueling things (even if not explicit put on the screen, because they happen outside the frame) that will be there for us to witness. Schindlers List was more personal in terms of following someone who was trying to save people. Here you have someone who is just trying to survive. And he has his hands full with that 'task' as you will be able to see. It may be without color, but that just enhances the viewing and the cruelness depicted. I can't imagine anyone being left untouched by this. Unless you don't like the way it is filmed (you could compare it to the 'Found Footage' style, but would do this movie a big disservice to put it even near that area)",9,0,1,11 November 2016
Live Free or Die Hard," Balls to the wall ..
","... or through the wall ... One thing is for certain here and you should be aware of that fact: There is no such thing as a story/plot that is noteworthy. John McLane - Bad Guys and speaking of the former, it's amazing how smoothly and to the point Bruce Willis is, in one of his (if not THE) trademark roles! He's jumping right into it, as if Part 3 was shot yesterday! I've got to give out Kudos to the rest of the cast, too. From the bad guys/gal to the sidekick Justin Long. I was afraid, he could ruin the movie, but he fits the bill and plays his role good (of course you can't compare him to a Samuel L. Jackson, but that's not the point here). What is the point though, is the action on display. And the action is pretty d*mn good! There are things/stunts that you might have seen in the trailer, but even if, you'll be equally amazed by them! You couldn't tell from the action on screen, but the movie is PG-13. From what I heard (rumors), there will be a longer version on DVD, which I'm looking forward, too. Is it still worth watching in a theater? If you're a McLane/Willis fan, the answer will be yes and you'll love the movie. But even without any knowledge of the previous installments in the Die Hard series, as an action fan, you'll enjoy this movie! Yippie-kay-yay ...EDIT: I have to admit, that seeing Bruce Willis as John McLane, made me oblivious to the fact, that the villain was kind of non existent. Or at least, not that impressive and/or threatening ... still good action though!",8,0,2,30 June 2007
Thor: The Dark World," Mirror
","While this is a continuation and some people might eventually get fed up with all the superhero movies, this really is a nice follow up, not only to the Avengers, but especially to the first Thor. Whereas you had Thor as fish out of water in that one, this time around someone else takes over that department.It's also very nice to see Natalie Portman back again, her missing out on the Avengers. There is always some reason why the other Avengers are not present and I guess you could question that, but you would take a lot from your own movie watching experience if you did. Plus you have enough on your plate here (or on your screen to be exact), that holds your attention. The mood and the fine line this walks (fantasy and comedy) continues, even though the reigns were handed from Branagh to a Game of Thrones director. Good choice it seems ...",8,2,4,2 June 2014
Lucy," Crazy Lucy
","You probably have seen the trailer or at least know where this is going. Now if you do know this, you also know how crazy the story sounds. As crazy as it sounds, the movie actually delivers and even expands on that craziness. It's borderline when it comes to 'making sense' (if you can even call it that).Scarlett plays her role (and especially her 'turning') very well. The inciting incident is actually kind of stupid (kicking), considering what happened before. But it does fit with the general mood of the film, that is so over the top, that it's not available to grab (not even for someone like Bautista or any character he might have played - you'll either understand or haven't watched a certain movie with him). It's really out there (or in there?) and is either real fun to watch or you'll really hate it ...",8,1,6,8 October 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," Growing up Wes Anderson style
","Wes Anderson movies seem to play in a parallel universe, where everything seems to be slightly off. But in a good way that is. While it might seem he is interpreting his childhood years (in most of his movies), whatever it is he does, he does so in a very unique style. From the sets to the story to the dialog.Our main characters here are kids. And the romance between them is pure, which is quite a task. I can imagine that still some people might find a few scenes awkward, but that would be their interpretation and nothing Anderson was aiming for. It's almost fairy tale like, with some crazy characters thrown into it. The kids making more sense than the grown-ups most of the time. Beautiful movie, that even cynics will find difficult to dismiss.",8,1,3,27 September 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Seventh Awakens
","Although if you either dismiss Episode 1-3 it could also be 'the fourth Awakens'. But back to this one and let me begin with, that I'm not even close to being in the top of the biggest fans, when it comes to Star Wars. I came late to the party and enjoyed the movies (some more, some less) and am not obsessed with the whole thing. Always liked Han Solo, especially the way Ford portrayed him.Having said that and not being able to be too detailed on every little inside joke, I can tell you that this feels like a Star Wars movie to me. Maybe it's on the surface and maybe some feel it is even too close to the Originals (copying certain things, paying respect as others would describe it). It's just the beginning of a new trilogy and 2016 has another Star Wars movie lined up, that is more of a spin off. So to see what the repercussions are (for surviving characters), you'll have to wait until 2017. As it is and as cliché as some things go down (like our main 'bad guy' here, so misunderstood as he would possibly say himself) and as predictable as others are, you will have a couple of wow moments and giving the new female lead some power to be doing stuff rather than just being there, this has a lot going for it.Maybe not the best Star Wars movie out there and interestingly enough the reaction was either love or hate (do people really think of this being worse than Episode 1? Wow). Embrace it for what it is, because it does capture what George Lucas was trying to do back in the day ...",7,4,22,26 November 2016
RED," Code
","With actors like these, could anything possibly go wrong? I for once think there was not a great chance of that happening. And thankfully the makers did match my expectations. I was expecting everything from the actors though I have to say, that the role portrayed by Ms. Parker did surprise. I came to expect her in other more active roles, so it was funny seeing her being more passive this time around.Willis is laconic as ever, but he gets out-shined (as do the others) by John Malkovich. He is just great. The movie of course is not to be taken too seriously. It always delivers its dialog with a smirk and a wink. You may not like that of course, but if you do, you will very much enjoy a movie that really is enjoyable on many aspects.",9,0,1,31 December 2010
Flight," Layers
","This first section is for American readers and/or others who are prude. There is nudity in this film! I was actually shocked to see that, not because I had a problem with it, but because I never thought the movie would start this way. So if you have a problem with nudity (you shouldn't, but I know some do and that's OK), be aware of that fact! The rating should indicate the reason for it getting an R, I'm sure.Having put that out of the way, let us concentrate on the essential. You might have read about this movie and might have a picture how this is. Denzel Washington might be one of the few people who will be able to blow away those expectations. Plus the movie might not exactly go into the direction you think it will. It's really about one character and the journey he takes (no pun intended). If you can stomach it (the character can, kind of), then this will be very rewarding (hopefully)",8,3,6,14 July 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," What's next?
","After the movie had played for the last time in a cinema, you could hear the cinema owners moan. The Harry Potter movies were a cash cow. Not only for the studio that produced them, but also for anyone who played them in their cinema (chain). Now it's over and everyone is thinking: What's next? While that may sound like something that may not be of interest to you, think of that: When you watch Daniel Radcliffe, do you immediately think of Harry Potter? What about the other young actors in this? It might be difficult for them to find themselves. While they all tried other things, even during the 'Potter years', they became the faces of this movie franchise.Getting back to the movie. The special effects are up to date (something you should expect), the story concludes nicely (for someone who hasn't read the books, including myself). The acting is solid throughout. There is one scene though, that was really bad. And it involves Daniel R. and a train station. Unfortunately he can't convey the emotions he is going through in this pivotal scene. Other than that, you will watch it if you have seen the other movies and won't be disappointed",7,0,1,16 January 2012
Unbroken," Strong will
","This is based on a true story and it makes it almost unbearable to watch at times, if you actually think about that while the movie is running. But while the scale seems immense, as another reviewer pointed out, sometimes the movie seems awfully bland. And it has nothing to do with cinematography or the acting.The ordeal of our main character begins at a certain point and seems not stop. While everything is happening and some other characters seem very evil (almost to a comic degree), the will of our protagonist never seems to sway. Something that is needed for the viewer to stay attached, especially during some horrible things that happen. A tour de force that seemed enticing enough for Angelina Jolie to get her hands on it",7,0,0,14 September 2015
Final Destination," Great idea
","The concept (not a high end concept of course) of the movie is really great. It works perfectly as a Horror movie and it is fairly good acted. Since it is/was the first of its kind, it has the seal/stamp of something new.Since there are 3 follow ups, the title isn't really accurate, but that shouldn't bother you. Apart from the idea, what really will grip you is the inventiveness of the script. There are so many settings and so many different ways of ... well you'll see if you watch the movie. I don't want to spoil anything, if you haven't read anything about the movie(s) yet. But as Horror movies go, this was one of the best that came out 'recently'.",8,1,2,29 October 2009
Rear Window," Voyerism 1on1
","No pun intended of course. The movie itself sets up the stage (again with a likely pun) and where we're going to spend most of our time. We are as confined as the main character here. We see what he sees and we may react similar as he is. Adding visitors and strange neighbors, who all have something going on ... it makes you wonder what is going on next door? And that is one of the things Hitchcock displays here.There are many stabs (at marriage, human nature, sanity etc) and it is even more relevant to some I reckon during a lockdown/pandemic. Not entirely claustrophobic, but also quite contained in the world it is showing us. Men can be mad and certain circumstances will bring the worst out in them. The movie depicts so many ticks and character traits you could easily write novels about it. As it is, you can also just enjoy it as the thriller that it is",10,1,1,3 May 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The End is near ...
","Like with the first two LotR movies, I hadn't (and still haven't I have to admit) read the books. So if your're looking for any comparison between the book and the movie, you have to look for other comments (and there are plenty of them here). The only thing I know, is that a small part of the end of book two (Two Towers) is implemented in Return of the King. Unfortunately for me, a review I read about the movie, did spoil that fact for me.In case you aren't aware of the book, I won't spoil anything that happens in this movie. But I'm going to assume that you have watched the previous installments ('Two Towers' and 'Fellowship'). Our group has split up in 3 different smaller groups, each of which has it's own journey to go through. While Frodo and Sam have found themselves a companion in Gollum, the end of part two has hinted something dark that might happen here.That's one of the best things of the movies: The interaction and sometimes even seamless transitions between characters feelings for each other (Legolas vs. Gimli to name but one). Most of the time it's done in a subtle manner and even if it's played theatrically (here in this movie, a relationship between a father and his sons), it's impossible to defy the magic this movie brings onto your screen.The action is great (although a villain we can hang ourselves onto, like the leader of the Uruk-Hai in the first movie, is still missing) and the landscape phenomenal as in every movie of the series. While it was clear, that the actors wouldn't be considered Oscar material, they all bring their A-game and especially Viggo Mortensen is a revelation (makes you still wonder, what would've happened if the original actor that was cast for that role, went through with it).The main problem I see here (and many others have stated that also), lies at the end ... well 'endings'. The movie doesn't seem to know, when to stop. So while you think all is over, you get another set-piece ... and another one ... and another one. While this might seem like nit-picking to some, some others were bothered very much by that fact. Still this is the best Fantasy Franchise that has hit our screens and makes other efforts seem pretty dull (Dungeons & Dragons anyone?). Now let's see if I can manage to read 'The Hobbit' before they make a movie out of it ... (I've already read a few pages)",8,2,4,21 July 2009
The Purge," One Night special
","The premise is pretty simple but very effective. It's supposed to say something about society overall, but is still a fun movie to watch. Well let's say entertaining, because fun might be stretching it for some. I'm surprised about the current 5.5 this movie has here though, especially because this was a big success in America. So big in fact, it will spawn a sequel in (probably) 2014.The movie treats the idea as if you might not have read the reviews, so you won't get thrown into the mix right away (maybe the sequel will do that). It will tell you what you are about to watch. The really amazing thing, which might have elevated the movie a lot more, is Ethan Hawkes character. The way he portrays him and he is written, with an arc and a clear structure is not something you get to see often in movies like this one. It's refreshing and a nice touch to the whole thing. Having said that, the movie is not entirely without surprises. Good Night and Good Luck indeed!",7,1,1,1 September 2013
Pitch Perfect," Title says it all
","And it's not talking about the lead actress in here. While I do love Anna Kendrick, the movie has a phenomenal cast throughout. It's not a 'musical' mind you (something that has been mentioned here by other reviewers), but it does have singing in it. It is a comedy version of the recent dance movies we have seen. Of course there is also dancing in this one and there is romance in it too.While the romance part does not work quite as well (mostly towards the end of the movie) like the rest of it, it doesn't really take much away from it either. It a fun light movie, that you can watch with almost everybody. And it brings a smile on your face (actually more than one)!",8,1,3,5 July 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The same but better
","I only have read the first book of the Hunger Games, but seen both movies. The first movie had to be restrained and was compared to a Japanese movie (not without a reason). While this seems a bit like a rehash of the same, it is way better in execution. It's still a bit too long and has some issues, but the comedy bits do work in its favor and there seems to be a switch in pace.Twists aside (which should actually be apparent), most will be looking forward to the conclusion with the third book getting released too. Unfortunately (or is it fortunately?) the third book will be getting the split movie treatment. Until then (and lets hope it won't be the same again, because they will get out of options with doing it again ... and again), enjoy this and Jennifer Lawrence in it.",7,1,13,6 June 2014
The Matrix," Blender
","The Wachowsky Brothers took many elements, from different cultures, that they liked, put them in a blender and mixed them together. And the Matrix is what came out. A great sci-fi movie, that has many elements from other movies (and a theme we have also seen in horror movies), put well together.While I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan, he does convince here (as he did in Speed). So while he is in action territory, there is always fun to be had with him. Carrie Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne have a great supporting roles, although of course it is a more stylish adventure than anything else. And while the movie leaves open quite a few questions you might have, it works for the movie, being only told a minimum amount of plot. The Keanu Reeves character acts as the viewer as he is thrown in an unknown world. Being baffled and stunned by the whole thing, this might be the reason his casting works so good ...Apart from that, the action is amazing (Yuen Woo-Ping, very well known for his Asian/martial arts choreography's), the set pieces and the dystopia feel of the movie is pretty convincing ...",9,0,3,21 July 2009
Godzilla," Two sides to this
","If I were to judge the monster movie or just the human story (though I'd have to divide the first part, more like an intro to the movie and the rest of the 'human' sob-story - pun intended) it would get two different ratings. Now the old Godzilla movies might not have cared too much about the humans themselves it was more about the monster. And in a way the movie pay tribute to that. Actually, anything involving the 'monsters' is done with the utmost respect to the history of the 'franchise' (not sure if that's what they'd call it in Japan, but let's stick with that, why don't we).But when it comes to the human story, especially anything absent Bryan Cranston (who does ramp it up a bit, but never truly fails to convey and convince in his role) and maybe our Japanese go-to guy (though he does have some lines that might make you cringe), the rest is absolute nonsense ... and not in a good way. Too many clichés, too many lightweight and not fleshed out characters, that kind of take the wind out of the movie. Fortunately not entirely, because you can rely on the action and CG to ramp it up a notch.For some it's a case of too little too late, when it comes to the actual 'star' of the movie, but I liked it just the way it was. You don't have to have him there every second of the movie ... if you feel differently though, you'll be more than disappointed",7,1,3,20 September 2014
Looper," Out of the Loop
","The movie had a lot of Buzz coming into the cinema. And I wasn't disappointed when I watched it. Twelve Monkeys remains the best themed time travel movie, but this is a very good Sci-Fi effort that has something original to tell. But you wouldn't expect anything less from the director of Brick. That's why Levitt was on again, but this time with the support of Mr. Bruce Willis.Great casting choices aside (Emily Blunt and others shouldn't go unnoticed), the movie does live with a great story that it tells. Of course the main performances hold it all together (just because it is Science Fiction does not mean, it has to be out of this world). I kinda got a De Niro vibe while watching Gordon Levitt. But I seem to be in the minority there. Then again, it speaks for a movie, if different people can read different things into it.",8,1,5,9 May 2013
Life," Not that Alien
","Let's keep it real, you could easily say that this pays homage to many Sciece Fiction movies. One of them is easy to spot and it's the original Alien movie. Now I put it nicely, because others might also say that it stole a lot. Whichever way you put it, it means one thing: there is a lot of predictability in this.That either means, you will be bored and angry at characters or you will just enjoy the well executed ride (no pun intended). The effects are good and while the characters do stuff you might not always agree with, it's a movie and stuff has to happens. I've seen worse decisions people made. There are downfalls (like the ending), but it still keeps with spirit of the movies that inspired it ...",8,2,6,26 July 2017
Heat," More than De Niro and Pacino
","What can you say about this movie, that hasn't been said before? Not much, but I state my opinion nonetheless :o).It is undeniably an action classic, although some people will find it (too) slow moving. So if you're more the fast paced action movie viewer, there's a chance that you won't quite enjoy this movie that much.Apart from the well staged action scenes (and the much talked about on-screen meeting of Pacino and De Niro), the supporting cast has to be mentioned. Not only Val Kilmer (who hadn't been that good in a movie since Doc H. in 'Tombstone' and since then might only have achieved a likewise performance in 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', though comedic and overshadowed by Robert Downey Jr), but every single one. Be it Danny Trejo, Tom Sizemore, Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight to name a few ...The great film about the movie then (for me) is not the action parts (can't say I don't enjoy them! ;o) ), but the acting in the movie. Nobody is overplaying his/her part.So great acting+good story+well 'executed'(directed)=Classic (imo)",10,1,3,2 November 2006
50_50," Bittersweet symphony
","I had the pleasure to watch this at a sneak preview. I really enjoyed its quirkiness and it's mix of drama and comedy. Jonah Hill may seem to do his known sch-tick, but if you stick around, you'll see another side to that story/coin. And he brings emotion with the (sometimes vulgar) comedy bits.Even the most unlovable character in this has something going for her. But you know what you are facing after the first few minutes. And if you like them, you will like the movie. Even if you think there are a few bumps along the ride (there are), the movie is more than worth it. One of the best films I've seen in 2012 so far. Sweet and dramatic, crass and soft and other things at once. And still manages to balance them out quite nicely.",9,0,1,31 May 2012
What We Do in the Shadows," Could this be real?
","Let me start with: I don't like 'reality TV' at all. And there is a reason you have to put '', because it is anything but real. And while this isn't real either (obviously), it is so much more fun than anything and feels more like what good reality TV could be ... if there where Vampires that is.The basics are clear. As is the fourth wall that is practically not existent, because we are in the middle of it all. Does it always make sense? Of course not, that is the nature of shows like that. How did the camera get in there beforehand? But at least the camera (or the guy holding it) get recognized a lot. The group of people behind this are popular, maybe not worldwide, before this movie came out, but at least 'at home'. And it shows, because of the chemistry they have. This is very well written and acted. Comedy timing is essential and in this case awesome.",10,64,86,23 December 2014
Deadpool," Not MCU, but still great
","Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The 'wink wink' humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the 'shame' of being 'green' (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...",9,10,19,26 November 2016
Get Him to the Greek," Where's the Greek?
","No Greeks here ... well at least none I could identify. But apart from my oblivious state of mind concerning the location of the Greek (not sure if this is a real thing they refer to, to be quite honest), this is a funny look with a lot of swipes at the music industry in general and celebrity status too.Just the beginning though is something that will alienate quite a few people. I saw the uncut version, so not sure of how much of the music video is in the regular cut. But let's just say yo can't be squeamish or on a political correctness path - this will not sit well with you. If you dislike Brand himself ... well that doesn't help either. I know some people who find him annoying and his role here does not help liking him more.I'm not saying he's playing himself (hey, that's not what I meant, though there are quite a few innuendos in this one, so who knows?), but for some what is portrayed here, is how they perceive him in actual life. Overall this is juvenille and quite vulgar from start to finish. Puff Daddy (Sean Combs) or whatever he's calling himself is quite the discovery ... let's get it on then",7,0,0,21 May 2020
Cloud Atlas," Reading before watching(?)
","I have to say that I never read the novel. So I had no idea what I would let myself into. Especially the beginning was almost too much too handle. It seems like everything comes down on you. It's tough to keep up, but if you get through those first 10-20 minutes then you will be able to see one great movie (I reckon, like me, even without having read the book) with some phenomenal acting in it.Obviously some actors play different roles, but stay with the credits to be surprised! Unless you really could tell everyone apart. But don't concentrate to much on that spotting game! You'll have enough on your hands to stay with the story. Is there a message though? How is everything connected? There might be more than one question unanswered by the end of it ... which brings me to the point, that I absolutely have to watch this again ... and maybe appreciate it even more",8,4,7,3 June 2013
300," About that time
","After movies like Troy and Alexander I'm glad the cool Greeks are back! ;o) Seriously though: I really liked this movie, although I'm not in any way supporting the Spartan way of life (which is one of the few things, that is accurately depicted in the movie).Having said that, it would be a mistake to say that this an accurate depiction of what happened back then (history-wise). It is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller (and yes his novel is based on the historical events, but he took the liberty of changing a few things). And although I haven't read that novel yet, I heard the movie is very accurate to the graphic novel.Don't mistake this movie as a political propaganda too. Yes there are certain lines that can be interpreted that way (pro-Bush and pro-War), but they were either written/invented by Frank Miller a few years ago or they have been said many centuries ago (like the, then 'we will fight in the shade' saying). So why connect them to the recent developments in the middle east? People say it's the timing (like why did the film come out at a time like this? You could argue that scenes like that couldn't be made a few years ago).So yes you can read anything in the movie if you want to. But is that how you should absorb the movie? I don't think so! I think either you are going in (especially after having watched the trailer and/or teaser) wanting to have fun (although some scenes are not for the faint of hearted, decapitations and so forth) and enjoy a popcorn movie or you just want to hate ... It's up to you to decide ...",8,2,8,10 April 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," So self aware it might hurt
","At least some of the viewers. Comedy is always something that will divide people. Because what's funny to someone, others find boring or annoying. I'll just say colorful sprinkle, you'll know what I mean, when you see it towards the end of the movie. I thought it was awesome, but I heard people complain about this 'getting out of hand', being unrealistic/over the top.But that's it, because while it seems to have both feet firmly on the ground, it's always on some other level 'flying' around and giving kudos to old spy movies by acknowledging their existence and tweaking, sometimes twisting our expectations. Something that is done very nicely. But the movie is not meant for those easily offended. It has some crude humor and one of the last scenes, will have a couple of people (especially in America) cringe .. more so, than if some violence was involved.If you can deal with that and don't mind this being 'British' to a point, but very on the point when it comes to jokes, while not forgetting that there are consequences, you'll enjoy this. After an initial resentment against the young lead here, I grew to really like him. A very good achievement. Also hearing Samuel L. Jackson lisp - just amazing",10,5,13,26 June 2015
The Hangover Part III," Where's the Hangover?
","It's kind of funny. When Hangover 2 came out, people criticized it, because it was more of the same. It was basically a remake of part 1. Though I still do wonder why 'Very bad things' did not do as much business as those movies. But anyway, now they try something different and people are mad, because it's not a rehash of the previous movies. It does actually try to tell a story.Don't worry though there are still many elements that make the movie feel like it's Hangover. Like our 'pack' trying to find/figure out something. Also a character that gets forgotten, has a similar fate but with a twist. And don't think because there is no hangover, there will be no hangover! You'll get that by the end of the movie. So while people cried, this actually is better than the second one",7,2,4,29 August 2013
Easy A," Sweet Girl
","If you loved Mean Girls (the Original so to speak), then you will love this one too. It is funny and the dialog is just great. If you like your characters to be extra clever that is. Of course it is a movie and they do seem to have an answer to almost everything. But that's the fun of it. It does not take itself too seriously, so try to get over it. The movie is there to entertain you.Same can be said about Emma Stones character, though the 'entertainment' she is offering is of another kind. But then again, maybe she is not offering anything. And of course you could argue about her actions. But not everything has to make sense to be funny and enjoyed. There is really good acting going on and the movie dares to go places. It's sweet, but also mean at times. It walks the line perfectly without ever falling over to one side or the other. And Emma Stone is a rock in this formula (no pun intended)",9,0,0,30 December 2010
Fast Five," Quite a lot
","And I am not referring to the number of movies the 'Fast and Furious' franchise has built up to now. I am talking about the actors involved in this. Which leads me to the conclusion that Justin Lin must have done quite a lot things right too. Not only does he return again and again to the franchise (it's his third time at the helm), but he brings back a lot of people you'll recognize from the previous movies.That of course means, that you might want to freshen up your memory and re-watch the previous movies. Yes even the 'Tokyo Drift' one! A new face is Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson of course. And while he's not quite Tommy Lee Jones (as seen in 'The Fugitive'), he brings a lot to this movie! All the actors do not count of course, if the action isn't right. And you have some very nice set pieces here, very well choreographed. A real fun ride then. Of course you can tell that this won't be the last one (stay and watch until the end credits roll through to get a tag end/scene), so I do wonder, since the title get smaller and smaller, will they call the next one 'F-Six'? And then 'F7'?! But until then, enjoy the movies as much as you can :o) (just don't try it at home/on the streets yourself!)",7,0,2,26 December 2011
The Thin Red Line," Saving ...
","... the anti war movie from clichés ... That is what other movies did (SPR from the same year is just one example), building on clichés and not letting you see the enemy as humans. Here you see the enemy also as humans (one thing that Clint Eastwood might have achieved too in his two war movies, he did, with Flags of our Fathers and Letter from Iwo Jima). Or another big contrast you have here: Silence and Noise! The silence at the beginning of the movie is intolerable (maybe unbearable is the more appropriate word). Silence that is felt more so, when it gets loud ... and it does get loud. This is not to say that Terence Malick is exhausting every last drop of an action scene. Often times he even cuts away to a little episode, that involves one particular soldier.Speaking of the soldier. The amount of big time actors that got involved with this movie, is proof enough, that there is more to this movie than the war it depicts! You might not even see some of the actors, because it's a blink-and-you will miss them appearance! Jim/James Caviezel is the main actor and he delivers a career highlight here. Everyone is talking about him playing in Passion of the Christ, but this one is the one he shines and has his breakthrough performance!Edit: I had a chance to re-watch it on the big screen (International Festival in Berlin). And my admiration for this film only grew. The thin line between humanity/inhumanity, sanity/insanity and more contrasts are on display here. And you are still able to watch it as only a(n) (anti-)war movie. What I also realized on the second viewing, is the perfect 'score' (no pun intended). The music is really a great factor in this movie.",10,2,5,6 April 2007
Green Book," Worlds/books collide
","It is difficult to make a movie based on a true story, with characters that existed, that has to walk a fine line when it comes to racism, the history of America and not making them too unlikeable, but also finding the middle, so there is still enough tension between the pair we are about to go on a journey with - and overall the movie succeeded.There are certainly things that did not work or might seem like an omission - Viggos character shows a despise, a darker shade to him at the beginning, that does not really seem to come up later. And then there is the meeting - which is cleverly orchastrated but we never really understand why it continues from there. But not everything needs to be explained. Unless that takes something away from your movie watching experience.Script is tight and the actors are really getting it on good. And there is still enough drama to go around. You will laugh, you may cry a little (or a lot) and overall you will see a great movie. All cynicism aside, this very well made (did not look into how close this is to what actually happened, you may research that on your own, if you like)",9,0,2,11 May 2019
Da 5 Bloods," They got five on it
","Spike Lee is outspoken. He does not make it a secret that he is not a fan of Trump at all. Now in the time we live in, that may make his movies a no go to some (yes political views seem to matter to some more than the actual quality of the movie they might or might not watch). In this though, Spike Lee tells a story and does not just give us a history lesson.A story that is complicated, with regrets, with PTSD, with hidden treasures, with mental issues and more. There is a lot that can be discovered here. One of the things being who the characters are. Including one Black Trump fan - missguided you say? Well the position of Spike is clear on this, but the movie has more to say than just that. And the soundtrack helps boosting that, even though I'm not sure the placing of the ride of the valkyries was the best. But that's just me and how I experienced it. You may feel it's completely apt.Now Spike does not hold back and there will be blood, there will be violence in this and there will be quite the weird relationships and how they play out. Sometimes the ghosts of the past do not let go. Even if they never meant to keep you down. This is complex, yet intriguing, suspensful and entertaining to a degree, while very informative too. Social injustice and social equivalence has not been achieved yet - if you don't confront your past, you can't be living your future!",9,3,7,18 June 2020
Fantastic Four," 2 reasons why this ain't so bad!
","And no I'm not talking about Jessica Alba here (I wonder why someone would think that? ;o) ... but seriously though, the two reasons why this movie worked for me and wasn't as bad as the critics made it sound are: Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans! Their 'relationship' is the core or anchor of the movie. Before I go on, I also have to admit, that I don't know the FF comics that well, so any inaccuracy that might be in the movie, I can't point them out to you. One thing is for sure, if someone goes invisible, without clothes, that means you can't see them! (wouldn't have been PG-13 then also, right?) ;o) So while the movie has it's flaws (storyline/some action/characters/and so forth), it is still a nice/good enough movie to watch and it all comes down to two people! (there's also an unrated longer version out now on DVD, but I haven't seen that yet)",7,4,5,3 July 2007
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Two for/plus one ...
","The third Twilight movie is a bit better than the second one (which was just too much of Kristens character crying/being sad/suicidal etc.), but does that even matter for Twilight fans (I heard they are called 'Twi-Hards', which is kinda funny) or those who won't watch any of the Twilight movies? I guess not and after I watched it, I was pretty sure it would be more than enough for the fans. Which is not completely true as I found out a couple of days later. Seems that fans do care about the franchise and as a (female) friend of mine told me, she had wished the movie would have looked much better than it does.What does that mean? That it does look a bit cheap (her words), because the set designs and everything else is pretty 'spartan'. I couldn't argue with that, though brining up 'Lord of the Rings' is not really fair to the Twilight franchise. And I guess the makers were thinking the same thing though. Why spend too much money on those things (when they had to spend money on CGI), if fans only wanted the relationships to look forward too. And a few fight scenes, too of course.And yes, as with every franchise, we do get 'darker' here. Nothing too much, still teen-friendly, but why would you expect anything else. It is what it is. And since I started watching the whole thing, I will be there for the last (two) part(s), too.",5,2,4,21 October 2010
Click," Another Sandler comedy?
","Not quite, this movie aims higher. Not that it's not having the cheap laughs here and there (and a wonderfully tongue in cheek performance by David Hasselhoff), but it tries to turn up the drama part, too ... with a message! Although not all, some of these moments, where the movie shows us what to do (with our lives), are badly done/executed! They don't feel right and don't quite mix with the rest of the movie (which is more light hearted).If you can overlook those moments, you will enjoy the funny moments in it (the premise alone is a hoot and they almost make the very best of it), because there are many laugh-out loud moments to be found here!",7,1,3,6 May 2007
Pineapple Express," Cheech & Chong reloaded
","I watched the movie at Sneak Preview, so I haven't seen the unrated DVD/Blu Ray cut yet. Still even that version, was pretty grim and a movie that will not appeal to people that get grossed out easily. I haven't seen 'Cheech & Chong' in a while, but I do feel it has the same feeling.The movie begins with a bang/laugh and you can tell right there at that instance if you will like the movie or not. If you think the intro to the movie isn't good/funny, than you won't enjoy the rest of it. At least not as much. I could tell by the audience reaction. Some did laugh at the beginning and those that didn't, weren't amused along the ride either.The movie walks a very thin line and doesn't care, if it walks all over the place. But even in it's weirdest moments or when it's completely off-balance, it still is kinda fun. At least that's how I felt! :o)",8,9,17,19 April 2009
John Wick: Chapter 2," Non Stop
","How and even more important who is supposed to stop John Wick? The character and the subsequent movie franchise. Maybe Denzel Washingtons Equalizer would be the correct answer. Maybe that is the mash up that would be amazing. On the other hand I've never heard any person throwing those two characters in one hat, so don't hold your breath.Back to Mr. Wick (and if you have time search the fake trailer for the Dog Wick, hilarious, though full of spoilers I reckon concerning the first Wick movie) and his new problems. You know when you just want to lay back, lift your feet up and do nothing? Wick thought he'd try that out for a change. After a fast paced action riddled opening sequence that is of course. But also of course: it ain't going to happen. And you know that wouldn't be the movie you'd sign up for. Mr. Wick doing nothing other than talk with his foes. The action is choreographed really well, some stunts may seem similar, but overall the gun play is amazing.People of the UK be aware of minor cuts that have been made to the version you are getting (30 seconds I think, but you can find out about that). But it's still full of violence and theatrical composition. It's beautiful and horrific in its own way. It's just wonderful and with Common it has one main antagonist who is up for the challenge ...",8,0,1,8 July 2017
Annihilation," Looking good
","Visually this is stunning or rather completely speaking from a technical point, I don't think you can find (m)any flaws here. And it also is clever with its timeline. Keeping the audience on its toes and having us guessing where this is going and also keeping us in the dark about things, that actually should be clear at that point in time (because it already happened you see?).It still feels like something is missing to make this big. Maybe I would have been more impressed if I had seen it on the big screen - unfortunately we were not given that choice, since a cinematic release was scrapped. But Netflix got the rights for the movie and at least we got to see it in good quality. Acting wise this is really good and there are some surprises at hand - if that is what you are looking for",6,0,1,19 June 2018
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Bad Ending and still ...
","... I just love it. Despite the ending! It is so weird, that I couldn't explain it to you, so you have to watch it. But just don't let it ruin the whole movie for you. It didn't ruin the movie for me although I was disturbed, to say the least.Monty Python (humour) is well known, through their TV series 'Flying Circus'. The series has all the main players that are involved in this picture too. And it is a movie, other than Meaning of Life, which was a sketch show.If you know Pythons than you know what you're up for, if not you might not actually like what you see. Although most people do as is evidently through the voting here at IMDb.com! The jokes are great and there are many laugh-out-loud moments for you to enjoy ... even some you'll want to watch over and over again! The end joke won't be one of these though!",9,0,1,4 April 2007
Minions," What did they say?
","Just the idea of making a movie with characters that are not actually talking (mostly one word and as has been said using all languages to make it harder for people to actually understand anything) seems terrible. But the minions have proved in two previous movies, that they can steal the show (amongst other things).Of course you can understand what they mean to say. Even if it's not even the actual word spoken (if you catch it and have knowledge of that said word of course). So yes you can criticize the movie for quite a few things, but what's the point? The minions are here to entertain and entertain they do - or as they would say: Banana!",8,1,2,29 September 2015
Incredibles 2," Super(?)heroes
","Sometimes doing the right thing, might not look like it is the good thing from the outside. Not to mention all the mayhem that ensues when superheroes go out and do their thing. Something that Marvel has cherished in their movies (especially when it came to the Captain America and Iron Man feud or whatever you want to call it), is also present here.But you also get a glimpse of how to deal with getting powers or rather how others deal with that (coming of age, parenting, whatever you want to call it). It's really well made and it is a worthy sequel. If you like your animation to also challenge you socially, while still being as entertaining as possible - look no further.",8,2,3,2 May 2019
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Fun ride
","I have to admit, that I didn't think this was going to entertain me as much as it did. There is the thin plot that made some people say that it gets the wrong message across. While it isn't entirely true (especially if you watch the movie you'll see there is more to it), you can understand why people would think that after watching the trailer of the movie.And there was also the weaker second Madagascar movie that I had in the back of my mind. So I was hesitant when I went to see this one. But the jokes do work most of the time (even though there are some weird music choices in the movie). The 3-D effects are also really adding additional value to the movie. Animated movies seem to get them right most of the time anyway, but I thought I mentioned this anyway.So maybe I liked it because of my low expectations or at least it helped a lot. But still if you are open minded you'll have fun with this",7,2,3,3 February 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," Really great music movie/drama
","You might not be a fan of the Coens, but if you like music in general and great acting in your drama movies, than you will love this. This might be the movie to put Oscar Isaac on the map. He has done stuff before that is good (like in the latest Bourne movie, the first without Matt Damon that is), but this is his star vehicle.And you can tell he put a lot into the movie and he makes it work. He sings himself and he can apparently sing. But he doesn't treat the character like a saint or someone without flaws. There is a lot wrong with him, but you have to embrace that. And there is no such thing as perfect. Maybe only in music or singing ... or performing like Mr. Isaac does in this one ...",9,1,2,18 June 2014
Sin City," Black & White in vivid colors
","If you love graphic novels, you have to see that movie. I hadn't read the novels before I saw the movie, but from what I understand, this is an exact page-to-screen adaptation! Yes there are many good comic book/graphic novel movies, but this is the best one yet (that is until Sin City 2 comes out of course).300 is good fun too, but this one has also character depth. It might be too much for some people (you have 3 separate story lines), but I thought it was pure genius. On the DVD you even can watch the stories as standalone episodes (Sin City Re-Cut DVD). Although this is filmed in black and white (with the odd color 'popping' up here and there), this is nothing like 'Resistance' for instance, where you couldn't tell things apart sometimes. This movie here,also has gray tones, so you do recognize everything on display! It's a graphic novel adaptation alright, but for those who are not familiar with the graphic novels, be advised that is not for children or those easily offended by violence and action! What else can I say, else that I love this movie! Can't wait for part 2 to come out :o)",9,1,2,4 July 2007
Saboteur," Blame Game
","This is about society, about perception, about rich people and 'poor' (working class) people. So a lot of that still resonates today. And the first half of the movie is quite a ride (really top notch). But when it becomes a bit preachy towards the second hald, it may alienate some. Still Hitchcock knows or rather knew what he was doing.Great storytelling, great characters and great suspense. Yes the latter is obvious when we talk about the master of it. This was one of the movies I actually had not seen before (or at least I don't remember having seen it before) ... he has done quite a few movies and this may be lesser known, which does not make it a bad one of course.",8,0,0,3 May 2020
The Ugly Truth," Truth about Love?
","There are quite a few movies out there right now, that are using the formula 'wild guy gets tamed by woman'. I don't even know if this is spoiler tag worthy, because if you watch one of those romantic comedies, you just know where it heads. So is it a spoiler to say the inevitable will happen here too? I don't think so, but just to make sure, I put the spoiler tag up there. Gerard Butler delivers a very good performance and together with Katherine Heigl they elevate the stuff they have to work with. The realization of both that they actually love each other works and even the silly 'tap water' thing moment does somehow work ... I mean if you think about it, it's pretty lame ... tap water a sign of love, really? The ending is fine, too, although the very last scene, was a bit too much. Didn't feel right with the rest of the movie. Still one of the better efforts, romantic movies-wise.",6,1,5,27 September 2009
The Cabin in the Woods," Meta Horror
","You can't make one movie that will appeal to everyone. Even within a genre there's always going to be people hating or loving something that the majority thinks is obviously the complete opposite. This isn't 'true' horror, it does have a lot of comedy, it also has a lot of wit. There are quite a few nods and there are many little things 'hidden' in the subtext or out in the open for people to discover. Even simple things as the 'running upstairs' cliché gets a spin (or at least I think it does. But with Joss Wheddon on script duties, I'm pretty sure this was no mere accident).Talking about clichés, you do get a few, but those clichés are there and they are always getting a spin that works. It doesn't look like Joss tries to make it work. He just makes it work. And while I did stress out the comedy factor, this still pulls some scares and does get dirty and bloody. Not for the faint hearted then.This warrants repeat viewings, just to catch even more hints, jokes and just pure Wheddon magic (for me at least). I went to watch it with high expectations (the buzz surrounding it) and I wasn't disappointed in the least!",10,1,5,7 September 2012
Windtalkers," Only the DC
","Although the intentions are very noble (showing the world how Navajo Indians helped in the war ... through their native language as code), the movie is not that good ...You would love to give it more kudos (at least I would), but even Nicolas Cages performance just doesn't really grip you ... you are left emotionless/cold. You don't really care for them or what will happen to them. And that is a death certificate (excuse the pun) for this movie. The fact that he had to cut down the movie, so that it would be cinema-friendlier, didn't help either ... so if you're going to watch this movie anyway, go watch the Director's Cut, because you will get more back story and emphasis on the characters.",6,0,1,6 April 2007
Spectre," Craig's list ...
","... is coming to an end. Obviously every so often a new Bond will emerge and I think Daniel Craig is almost done with his Bond cycle. I think there is another planned, but after the really good Skyfall, this falls a bit behind in many terms. Than again, it was almost impossible to capture that lightning again. Too many things happened in the previous one, many linked and appreciating the past Bonds.As you can see from my rating, I still dig the movie, it's just that it has it's flaws. It kind of ticks all the right boxes (great opening sequence), good villain, some really good action set pieces and a tension that holds up until the end. Some still have an issue with Craig portraying Bond, but then again, when Idris Elba was suggested, many disagreed with that too (I think he'd be a great Bond, but that's a whole different story). Depending on your taste, you'll either like this or not",7,0,3,18 November 2016

While I'm not aware of the historical facts and what parts might be true or not, the appeal of the movie is undeniable.The mix of drama, action and sometimes humor, is perfect. The action scenes are shot great and the intense feeling of being right there, in the battlefield ensues. The movie follows through, from start to finish and movie deservedly got many awards. Be it the acting, the costume department or any other aspect of the film, if you like action movies and/or historical movies, there is absolutely no reason for you not to watch this!",9,2,6,21 July 2009
Joy," Mop it up
","Is this kind of a mess? Yes you could very well argue that and win that argument. Will a mop suffice to clean it up? Well that's a different story. Actually it's the story of this movie or rather its main character. And you really do believe the hardships Jennifer Lawrence has to go through. Brilliant cast to support her, though as other have stated, I can see why some would just call it a mess and not want to get into it (pun intended).But while the dialog is rapid fire and there are probably many things enhanced for the viewing pleasure of the audience, if you do like people overcoming obstacles that seem impossible to overcome, you will like this movie. And it's not a spoiler, though I won't go into details, because this movie and the viewer know where this is heading. Even if you're not aware of the story of the mop. I know I didn't, but I also knew who I was rooting for, even when I was as distraught or perplexed as the main character ...",8,1,2,12 August 2016
Moon," Mind games
","There are so many nods to great sci-fi movies here, that I understand if some might feel cheated. But I hope that you don't feel this way about this movie. It has a great (weird) little story at it's basis, that will keep you guessing, where it is heading next (especially if you haven't read anything about the plot before you go ahead and watch it). Which is a really rewarding experience! When I first heard about the director trying to push his lead actor into the Oscar run, saying his performance got overlooked, I was surprised at how persistent he was. Now that I have watched it, I have to admit, that he is right and that he did deserve to get a nod (at least). He had to work quite a few things out, while he was making the movies. Like the frame of mind and other stuff.It really is funny, dramatic and suspenseful and pulls it off, without any big problems. Kudos to the script, the director and our main actor. If you like Sci-Fi, you have to watch this!",9,4,13,8 October 2010
Her," And him
","A very odd tale of love and technology. Not necessarily in that order. But while this is a very odd movie, it also is very nicely told. It takes its time and while you might wish there was more personality behind our main actor, it is obviously meant that the 'other' voice (Scarlett having a very recognizable voice if you're watching this in the original language and not dubbed) has more juice and more almost everything than the actual human being.The pacing is slow, but you should know and expect this from this 'romance' (if you want to call it that). The thing is, that this movie is not condemning technology. Technology is made by humans, so if it is anyone who is to blame one way or another, it's the person using the technology. Now please no analogies with weapons, that is not what I meant. Different beast here and no connection whatsoever with this movie. Enjoy this trip with some very interesting ideas",8,0,2,20 September 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Feel Good Fairy Tale
","When you watch the beginning it's almost clear, what will happen at the end. Still Danny Boyle keeps it fresh and gives us flashbacks of what happened up to that point. Flashbacks that are sometimes pretty violent. No wonder some Studios seemed to have a problem with promoting the movie. Although as Historz will show, it was their miss (just count the Oscars the movie won).Danny Boyle really went all the way and took some chances. Casting unknowns (Freida Pinto makes her first on screen appearance, I don't even know what she did prior to filming 'Slumdog'), tackling a subject matter that is unusual to say the least and being graphic and sometimes pretty brutal too, this was anything but a calculated Oscar movie. For that you alone you have to salute him.Overall a very good movie then (see my Summary line), with a few things that I didn't quite like. The story is too fairy tale, the brothers decision to change his mind and help Dev's character etc. etc. Things that were almost too fairy tale for my taste and didn't work 100% with the rest of the movie. Those are only minor things and 8/10 is pretty good in my book.",8,1,8,12 August 2009
The Nice Guys," Not so nice
","But very good if you are into this kind of stuff. So this is not Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or Last Boy Scout, but it is a new movie by Shane Black, which is a reason to get excited about. If you like weird dialog and situations comedy that he seems to be able to write spot on, then you are in the right place.Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling hit the nails on their heads. Deadpan or outright funny, completely insane to just weird. One thing this is not: Predictable or tame. You only have to decide if this is your kind of movie. If your taste and the movies do either collide or are in the same ballpark. If the latter is the case, do watch it and you'll get something unique and really good. One of the Highlights of 2016 for sure",9,34,51,25 January 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Furiosa to the Max
","Let's back off a little and look at who did this movie: The original Mad Max director! The guy who made all 3 previous movies then. He didn't really have much money when he made the first one (which is considered a classic and has some nice stunts, but has aged badly, feeling blown up at times, filling time to get to the 90 minutes mark), but it was successful enough to make more. The second movie was considered to be the best. Up to this point that is ... we have a new king (with a mad Queen by his side).So a 70-year old man brings you this movie that could and should be played in film schools. But don't get it twisted, this is entertainment as it should be. Unless you have a case of 'macho gone wrong', there is nothing you can fault in this. The beginning alone almost had me jump up and down with excitement. That's 5 minutes into the movie ... and more (insanity) was still to come.If you can fault the movie for one thing, it's that you don't get as much Mad Max (the character) as you got before. But it actually makes Tom Hardys character even more mysterious. We don't really know what he's about (it does seem to lean a bit on the previous installments, character development-wise, if you want it to be - but that's up to the viewer to decide). You don't have to have seen the previous movies to get this. And even if some things seem inevitable (and some might say cliché), the movie itself is just superb and pure entertainment. Stunts, ideas, editing, score and more all blend into a very fine movie indeed",10,3,19,8 July 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," War - The saviour
","This is based on a true story, which makes it even more amazing when you think about everything that happens. Of course you could start to question the motives and the morale of the main character (real person). But you would derive yourself of a really powerful but also violent movie. Teresa Palmer and the personal life may seem like a footnote, but they also show a strong personality.And while we can understand why there are so many people who try to discourage our main hero, we get a bit of an inside what makes him tick. Very early on in his life he had an inciting incident. One that scares you for life, one that is really paving the way. So the set up is clear, the action scenes on the other hand are very dirty and very brutal. But that is war, it's not for the squeamish. And while you may have issues with Mel Gibson and his private life (decisions), you can't fault the movie ...",9,6,10,12 June 2017
Warcraft," Pretty fun
","For an adaptation of a popular game, this is pretty fun. It tries to do both sides justice (good and bad are a fine line, when you get both perspectives), which may anger a couple of people, but is a nice touch. I have only played the original Warcraft games and never got around to the World of Warcraft one. Which on one hand is a good thing of course, considering how much time I would have been online playing.So I can't really compare what is being taken from the game and what they left out (heard some people complaining about missing characters). But you can imagine that a movie can not hold everything in it. Maybe there are (or were?) plans to include some things in a sequel. I doubt there will be one, considering the Box Office this made (or rather didn't make). Still if you like Fantasy and Science Fiction, you could do a lot worse. This is really fun",8,2,3,4 February 2017
The Runaways," Running into Michael Shannon
","Michael Shannon is really great in this. He's really out there and almost steals the movie from our two leads (played by Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning). I had no idea who they were playing or what the movie was about (having seen it at a Sneak Preview and generally avoiding reading too much beforehand).It's about growing up, about the music business, with very good performances. Though you might find it difficult to watch Dakota in a role like this, if you are used to see her as a kid. Well she's on the verge of becoming an adult and that plays into the role too of course. Kristen playing a sort of anchor in the movie. It is not a perfect movie, but it has many things going for it (the actors for one)!",7,2,8,23 October 2010
Me Before You," Taking control
","I haven't read the novel this is based on, but as with anyone else, I could also tell where this was heading. It's not really hard to tell, so it's not about the finish line itself, rather than how we get there. And it's a pretty entertaining (while also sad) movie experience. If you let yourself into the romantic world, that is cliché ridden to quite some extent.Also some paper thin characters and two people who desperately needed each other, even without knowing that (we knew, but you know I'm talking about). So while one has a partner, that does not seem to be a big obstacle. Especially when that person isn't the one. Ah, the simple structures hidden in very tragic events and personal stories. But this has a certain suave to it, because of the main actors who really do carry this, although it doesn't have too much to ride on. If you are into these kinds of movies, you'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll have a movie watching experience you were yearning for.",6,0,2,2 February 2017
The Breakfast Club," Time of your life
","Depending on when you watched this first (or will watch it), it will determine how much impact this will have. Obviously if you've watched it back in the day, sentiment will kick in too. And while I wouldn't go as far as to say this hasn't aged well at all, there are some indicators that the impact today for some new viewers will not be the same as back then.Having said that, the movie still holds up, as we get some missfits thrown in together and mixed up. All with different backgrounds, all with different issues and problems. All rebelling in their own way though. Against the 'teacher' of course. But the authority figure here stands for more and the class struggle, the growing up struggle, the maturing struggle, the being in school struggle - all stand for something. So while you may not feel the biggest association with any of the characters, if you really dig into the movie, there is much to find here",8,0,0,11 March 2019
Gladiator," Resurrection
","I haven't seen the Director's Cut yet and I have to admit, that the story really didn't capture me as much as it did with others. For once, many things that happened were so foreseeable, I was able to close my eyes, open them a few minutes later and could see what I predicted was gonna happen.While that still works for many movies, it did kind of ruin my enjoyment of the Gladiator. A movie which 'resurrected' the Sandal movie, as was stated back then. Obviously, ten years later it's safe to say, that didn't really happen. But what made this movie so popular? For one thing, every movie that has a sort of underdog as a main character, can always be sure to get many sympathies. But that's not all! Mr. Ridley Scott shot this movie in a great way. Some symbolisms in the framing and the color scheme, being also responsible for peoples reactions.And while I did like the fight scenes and the scenery in general, the movie left me cold for the main character. I'm not completely alone with my perception of the movie (I still think that a 6/10 is pretty good), but it's more likely that you will like this and won't really think about plot points and the journey of the hero, while you watch this ... Something I couldn't do.",6,0,5,21 July 2009
Donnie Darko," Future
","An extremely complex structure/movie, that might be too much for some people. Too much information, a too confusing plot line, not enough action, too slow a pace. All things that could be said about this movie. But it's still gripping. Even if you don't get what it means, after watching it the first time (I didn't), it still is a mesmerizing experience.In a time-line that doesn't seem clear, in a world that looks like ours, but feels entirely different, this movie gets its strength from the plot, which as well can be it's weak point for many. If you're not appalled to the strange, feel free to experience this movie ...",8,0,1,21 July 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Out with the old (Fox), in with the new ...
","You can enjoy the third Transformers movie quite a lot. Michael Bay did not have to listen to the criticism, but he did. You don't get a resolution on issues that concern the second Transformers movie, but the movie has reasonable gaps in its story. I'm assuming you have seen both prior installments, so I'm not considering talking about them spoilers.Megan Fox prominently has taken off. Reasons for that are not entirely clear, but I guess she wanted to move along. What's good is that it is resolved and mentioned in the movie. But is is really story you are looking for here? I can't speak for how much liberties Bay takes with the Transformers franchise. But I can say that he filmed this more coherent than the last one. The jokes are still there, but he toned a few things down (thankfully) and made the action scenes look better. Plus I could actually understand and see who was who in the shot.Not superior to the still best part in the series (the first one that is), but a return to action a la Bay, without much to think about. I still would have loved it, if they put a '3' after Transformers. It'd be a nice touch to the title, especially considering the 3-D that is used (which is used in a nice way too).",6,0,4,12 January 2012
The Social Network," Sorkins web/back
","If you have never heard of Aaron Sorkin you should seek out West Wing. One of the best TV shows produced ... EVER. Really great writing and smart plot combined. I didn't know he was responsible for the script for that movie, before I went in, but I should have seen that coming (or hear it in the dialogs).Of course before all that, was the idea of a movie about Facebook. Or the 'Facebook' movie as it was also called. It seemed like a joke. Until you heard the director attached to the project. David Fincher! Now why would he want to do a movie about Facebook? I can't really answer that, but I'm guessing he read the book, the main 'character' of the movie wrote and he found something in it, he liked.Same must go for Sorkin. His fast paced dialog, might feel a bit distance for some. But for those who came to love it, they will really cherish every line spoken in the movie. If the real deal is as clever and eloquent as Eisenberg who is portraying him? Don't know, but it's not like everything is made as an ode to the Facebook Founder. And Mr. Timberlake might finally get recognized as a real actor, too. He's earned it.",9,2,4,31 December 2010
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Bold, but not without flaws
","This movie is obviously meant as a statement and to raise awareness on some subjects, that especially Americans were not aware of. Europeans might be annoyed (as is evident in some of the comments here), you have to be aware of that. Angelina Jolie is a great actress and she might have watched some great directors work, but that doesn't mean she'd put out a masterpiece with this movie.The central story does concentrate on the religion more than anything, which leaves out a large part of another conflict (Croatians vs. Serbians) and takes it easy with just Muslims being targets. While the it does only revolve around that (and does a caricature of the main bad guy), the central message is that of trying to understand another no matter our background. Of course the movie does raise some questions. Some subtle and some not so subtle (the ending for example!). Is it enough for you?",6,2,10,22 October 2012
Macbeth," Fassbender is mesmerizing
","While the movie has its fair share of flaws (quite a few), Fassbenders performance almost makes up for all of them. Also Marion Coutilard of course, she is amazing in this too. So if you don't mind the movie being shot/spoken in Shakespeare English, you will have a very interesting movie on your hand.I'm also not too familiar with the Macbeth story in detail anymore (have to re-read it), so I can't tell if the movie does steer away at moments or leaves something out. But as it is, it does a good job and while it can not be considered the best Shakespeare adaptation, it still does the job, which comes down to the actors being as convincing as they are",7,1,3,25 July 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," After Ali, comes the Pursuit ...
","... of Happiness. And yes the title is deliberately misspelled (you will get it, after you watch the movie). Will Smith is even more believable than he was in Ali (at least to me), where I always saw Will Smith and never Ali. But here, he really carries that weight. throughout.A big part of him convincing me, was his son (in the movie). But I also was distracted by the son. I just could tell, that it was Will Smith's real life son. And that shouldn't be a bad thing, but it got me out of the movie a few times. Not in one of their best scene though (which plays in subway tunnel).Will Smith himself, said in an EMPIRE (magazine) interview, that he was really fond of the idea of the movie. He said that you don't have the right to be happy, but the right to pursue it (which is written exactly in that matter in the Declaration of Independence by T. Jefferson). If you think this statement is 'bollocks', than this movie just might not be for you!",6,0,2,15 April 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Story-wise the best
","Of the three movies. Obviously I'm writing this, after I've seen the complete Bourne trilogy, but I won't spoil anything of the story here, so don't be afraid to read. One thing should be clear here: You should watch Bourne Identity, before you watch the other two (and those in the right order of course).If you do so, you'll get the whole Bourne experience and it's worth it (even if I rated the first one lower than this one). Matt Damon does/acts like Bourne, by now (the second movie) he's completely Bourne so to speak (pun intended)! There's a car chase/scene here, that will leave you yearning for more! But it's not the only highlight. A great addition to the spy/thriller genre!",8,3,4,10 October 2007
The Great Gatsby," Stays with you
","I have to admit, when I watched the movie I didn't feel as attracted by it as I do now. But it grew on me, because I kept thinking about it and how it was done. And it's the first movie that Baz Luhrman did that really achieved that with me. It's only the 4th I've seen, but still something to cherish upon. The music would also be something you could cherish upon.Though I'm not sure if that also could be something that takes you out of it completely. While this is a period piece, the music is very modern indeed. It takes a bit to get used to that. Though the dance moves are clearly from that time, which goes to show you, that dance styles may differ, but the music could be different too and the styles would still be intact.But while music is always a big part of a Luhrman movie (as are the sets they are shot on, impressive as always), it is the story that is compelling. Almost as compelling as the main female character is to Gatsby himself. There are quite a few character flaws but also a depth to them, that might be rare to other Luhrman movies. I really liked where this was going and the movie is really good too.",8,1,5,29 August 2013
The Proposal," Engaged
","Sandra Bullock, mid forties, and Ryan Reynolds, mid thirties, play the main roles in this romantic comedy. But the age of our 'couple' isn't an issue throughout the movie. Which is a testament to Sandra and Ryan, because they pull it off.Of course this isn't the best romantic comedy ever, but the two have a good chemistry and play really well off each other. Sandra seems to really enjoy her role. Ryan is great when he get's a few good lines here and there. His comedic timing is good, the romantic aspect is working too, but as well. Quirky characters and a really bizarre scene in the forest (a scene that might leave some viewers completely baffled) add to the special flavour. Although the latter mentioned scene could almost have been a big downfall of the movie, Sandra somehow pulls it off (not completely, but enough for the movie to still work).If you're not bothered by the whole premise of the movie, than you might enjoy it. I did ... and when the credits roll, we get some 'extra footage'.",7,0,4,16 August 2009
13 Hours," Not about guilt
","You won't find anything here about emails and it won't really elaborate on the guilt question. It is almost like a documentary, showing what happened on the ground, showing the desperation that existed. This does take a while to set up the situation many may be familiar with from the news and have heard and/or read about. But when it starts it's almost impossible to take a breath.Just like the characters in this movie, you will be on the edge almost all the time. And it's really well shot and to think that this actually happened (probably some exaggerations aside), is really breathtaking. So the based on real events tag, works like a 'charm' here (if you excuse the pun). Also if you were affected by this, it may be very difficult to watch. If not, or if you want to watch a movie that really captures agony and action in a nutshell, this is the one to watch.",9,11,22,5 December 2016
Warm Bodies," Pretty good
","While this is above the Revenant level of humor/horror (conceived as PG-13 mind you), it still is unable to reach the heights of a movie called Deadhead. Still if you are looking for a romantic zombie comedy and you have already watched the 'Deadhead' movie (which also includes the 'road movie' aspect), than there aren't that many movies to chose from anyway.The lead actor is good and his 'side-kick' is pretty funny too. Our female lead is as beautiful as it gets and while not all of her decisions seem rational, this still is a movie and shouldn't be measured to hard on that front. The internal logic is working and the movies pace is good enough. Of course it is predictable, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun with it",6,1,3,13 August 2013
The Birds," Mad Birds
","Or is it bad Birds? Then again without motivation or explanation can we actually say which? I'd say no, which doesn't make this fact a flaw of the movie in any way shape or form. The main female does things that may feel quite brazen, especially considering the time this was made and how movies portrayed women back then. She is the one that takes action and follows a man (it would be quite creepy the other way around, but it also would be th way most movies would have done it back then).Having said that, there are some interesting choices and some quite maddening relationships that get explored. There is more to the story that you may feel and see the first time around. The feeling of suspense is there for sure though and that ending .. well I know I loved it, not sure about others, but that's the way to do it!",9,0,0,8 May 2020
Sully," Sully my name
","I remember when I listened to the news of this hero pilot, who made a really tough landing on water. That might be putting it lightly of course. Then again, there were people who said he took too big a risk and could've gone to an airport instead. Did he do something wrong? Computer simulations seemed to indicate there was another solution, a much safer one for everyone involved.And that is what this movie is about. It's a human story, about someone who though he did the right thing. But suddenly has doubts. You can't really compare this to the movie Denzel Washington did (which was also very powerful, one could argue even more powerful overall). These are different characters and different situations overall. If you like Drama and suspense combined you could do much worse ...",8,1,2,15 May 2017
Jurassic Park," That don't impress me much
","So OK the song (by Shania Twain) came out 4 years after Jurassic Park was released, but I was aiming at what I felt back in the nineties when I watched the movie. I know that people are still (as they were back then) impressed by the visuals, which might have faded a bit since then, but still are decent. But the movie itself or the story it 'tries' to tell is seriously flawed.But there is enough special effects moments and moments of suspense to cover anything up. Didn't work for me though, because I wanted and needed something more than just 'Dinosaurs for the first time feel like they could exist' (read be in a movie and feel real). Again good job with that, but lacks in many other things (that's my humble opinion). So if you can't be swayed off your feet by the idea itself and start questioning the characters and their ability to think in general, you still might be swayed by some of the actors. The Fly himself (Goldblum) is a great comic relief, but is it enough? Agree to disagree then? Not a terrible movie then, but not the revelation (apart from the effects at the time), it appears to be",6,4,12,11 July 2015
Valkyrie," Story is good ...
","Actually as the saying goes: Real/True life is stranger than fiction and sometimes more suspenseful! You can see that it is true with this movie too. Of course it does take a few creative ideas, if you will. So it's not exact history you get. But it is a movie and not a documentary. It still tries to stay as true to the facts as it can. Apart from the fact, that most of the time, Germans are talking English that is.And Mr. Tarantino has shown us, that it is possible to make a movie and cast people for the roles that are needed. See Inglorious Basterds and enjoy the multi-lingually of it! And Quentins movie is much more fiction than this one. Go figure then, I guess. Still a pretty decent movie, that had some troubles during production (Tom Cruise and his affiliation to an Organization were responsible for some of those), but came through it all ... eventually.",6,1,3,10 December 2009
Alien: Covenant," Not reinventing the Alien wheel
","But that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. Alien or otherwise, as in Science Fiction Horror in general. After Prometheus got slammed by many, for not being like an Alien movie, Ridley returns with a movie that can be called that (not just title wise). Of course it still will not appeal and please everybody. The classics are just on a different level and while he plans to continue the backstory of one of most beloved Science Fiction franchises, the question is, if he'll keep using themes that we are so familiar with? Or try something different and new? Whatever direction he'll go, people are already aiming.Having said all that, we do get a crew of people who should know better. And Michael Fassbender really bringing all to his role and although he's supposed to be without emotion, he actually has some. Not so much a wonder if you have to deal with humans I reckon. Cinematography is without fault, I saw this at an Imax and it was incredible. The framing, the sound design, everything is fitting. Being aware of certain things, you may see where this is going, so the experience may actually not be as grand as it could be. But this is still rock solid ...",8,3,6,22 August 2017
The Soloist," Deception
","The trailer might give you the impression that you are going to watch just another drama. But luckily it ain't so. This movie is gritty and does not deliver any easy answers. It has some pretty gross scenes (though they seem in tune with the situation the city is going through and depict therefor a very real situation), but all that is shown is in tune with the rest of the movie.Robert Downey again delivers. And to think that he almost completely went off the (acting/movie) radar ... Luckily he didn't and luckily for us, Jon Favreau got him back to the big game with Iron Man. A movie which allows him, to go do movies like the Solist and earn them some PR. With Jamie Foxx he creates a relationship that feels more than real (considering their characters and their 'flaws'). Watch this, but don't expect anything 'Hollywood' about it",7,0,0,13 June 2010
The Martian," The Gardener out of space
","It's almost impossible to not have seen at least glimpses/clips from this movie. But just knowing what this will be about, does not mean you won't enjoy the ride. It may be true with some other movies, but this works quite good. Even though we do know more and are expecting the inciting incident to happen to Matt Damons character.And while everyone else does not know about him and his status, we do know. And I think everyone can at least relate to some parts, when it comes to feeling lonely. Even someone who has a lot of people around him/her, has moments where you only have yourself (to rely upon). And Damon has a lot to do. You could say this is predictable (and maybe has an agenda, depending on the outcome always), but the tension still never lets up. Entertaining and funny too, even when Damon breaks a couple of rules of filmmaking (not talking to oneself, but then again, what else can you do? Plus he's not 'just' talking to himself ... well you'll see).",8,2,5,7 October 2016
The Fighter," Round X ... Fight!
","Even if this is based on a true story (family), it is not the first time you see a story like this unfold on the screen. So why does this attempt (X) should be the one to watch, especially if you have seen other movies like that? Apart from the powerhouse performances, this might be the movie that portrays a family with all their sides, in its most honest and brutal way.No punch is being hold back. It's always full force and you get to see the impact. It's humans interacting. And Bale well deserved the Oscar, even if Wahlberg was the one who was the driving force behind this movie even being made. He again seems to get into the role completely. He is one with the character (real life) and gives one of his better performances in recent years. The sisters are just great (like them or not) and Amy Adams has her own head and her own mind (not always a given).",9,1,2,22 December 2011
Evil Dead II," Within the cabin
","While Sam Raimi did base the first Evil Dead movie on his short movie 'Within the woods' (a short a lot of people would love to see someday, but there are some issues with it, either rights issues or the material is not good enough, I guess), this is a sequel/remake of the first one. It seems like he was ahead of his time.We do get a 'previously on Evil Dead' segment in the beginning, but it doesn't show the events that unfold as they were portrayed in the previous movie. It's like a short movie that changes the back-story a little bit. It also is a bit funnier than the first movie. Bruce Campbell is more than able to squeeze funny out of some situations. So while it seems like more of the same it is still more than entertaining.",7,1,3,29 August 2013
Law Abiding Citizen," Mixed feelings
","There have been plenty of movies with a similar theme and everyone who only has seen Gerald Butler playing the nice (romantic lead) characters might be in for a very big surprise. But then again, he has shown that he can carry action movies (300, Gamer etc.), but this is the first time he goes that dark. Empire Magazine said, that because nobody seemed to want that role, Butler who also is a producer on the movie, decided to take the role and leave the character he wanted to play at first to Jamie Foxx!!! If you watch the movie you will understand why. You might also get the feeling that there have been many re-writes and that the ending feels a bit ... well rushed. While another director was attached to this, he parted ways over creative differences. And again I'm sure he wanted a different ending. And I also think that there could have been something else at the end.My other problem was, that someone did spoil me the ending of the movie. Not very nice, but what can you do? She didn't do it on purpose, but I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more, if I hadn't known what was coming (although 'enjoy' might be the wrong word here).As stated above, this is not for the faint-hearted, because it is brutal and it is graphic in it's depiction (and that was the cut they showed in cinemas ... on DVD/Blu Ray it's even a bit 'stronger'). If you are up for the challenge, this will be a roller coaster ride ... though I can't promise that you will end up with mixed feelings after the credits start to roll ...",7,0,1,12 May 2010
Up in the Air," Off the leash
","This is one of the best things Clooney has been in. And he is really exceptional. It's not just a fluke, that all the three main actors were nominated for the Academy Award. It is funny at moments, but also very deep and dramatic most of the time. It is also a stroke of genius to let real people be 'interviewed' during a pivotal scene and therefor make it more authentic.One of the best movies to have come out in 2009, this really is a showcase for the actors (as mentioned), with a story to back them up. And you still cannot mention Clooney enough, especially because this seems to be as close to the real man or some of his real dilemmas that he has. And he still didn't back down from that challenge. A really good movie, with a great ending then.",9,0,2,26 September 2010
V for Vendetta," Behind the mask
","If you want to know who plays the man behind the mask, just look through the cast listed here. What I mean, are the ideals behind the man/mask. Because this movie has 'balls'. It does not shy away from a critical theme (which is terrorism) and does not pull any punches either.It's bold and it might leave you with a bad taste in your mouth or at least might make you reconsider a few things, you thought were right or wrong, before you watched this movie. If you haven't watched the movie yet, you might not understand what I've written, but you will after you watch it! I even wanted to rate this movie higher, but there is one part in the movie, that I didn't like at all and it just didn't feel right (I can't go further into that, without spoiling, I'm just going to say that, this happens, before one of our main characters 'changes' her hair style), but being as it is, if you like the sort of films I described above, go watch this one too!",7,0,1,21 April 2007
The Island," Could've been a fun ride ...

If you look at who's responsible for the movie, you kind of know that this one will not go into the dramatic part of the main theme/story that it revolves (if you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about, for all the others, I wrote it like that, so it won't spoiler anything for you), but will stay on the lighter side.Unfortunately it does try dramatic/philosophical at some point and it never quite achieves that. That's were the fun part will get spoiled. But that's not all, you also got characters (one in particular, Djimoun Hounsou), who have mood changes that just don't make any sense! Even in a movie like this, there's got to be at least the bit of sense for the audience to care ... but if you people changing 'directions' like leaves in the wind ...That might be nit-picking for some, but it wasn't for me :o)",5,0,0,7 July 2007

","I liked the cast of the movie. And the beginning was really great. But then it flattens a little bit. It's like you're from 0 to 100 m/h in 3 seconds and then your engine jams/breaks somehow ...At least that's what I felt. Will is nevertheless doing a good job and there are many laugh out loud moments, but it feels like it is just too long ... even for a comedy like that. And some might find it funny, but often times it's just annoying, when Sascha B. Cohen (aka Borat/Ali G.) and Will F. are improvising their lines at each other. It's like, the director is saying, OK that's the set-up for this scene, now do your thing. It can be funny, but it also get's boring and tiresome after a while.Still this is a comedy and it ain't bad at all, but I'd expect more of that movie and it didn't deliver!",6,1,4,5 February 2007
Furious 7," Time to say Goodbye
","Although as you can imagine, the Fast&Furious franchise will go on. But for those unaware, before the filming was completed one of the main stars throughout the series Paul Walker died in a car accident. That fact alone is terrifying and horrible, the movie therefor got delayed initially. Reshoots were ordered and there is a digital Walker in here (he's not difficult to spot, quite the opposite, though I'm not certain, if we are not there yet, technically or if they chose to do it that way, so people would know).Whatever the case, the movie knows and plays with the expectation of that fact (and in a very fine way too), while we wait for that resolution to happen. Some might argue, that therefor the movie is too serious, but it's just the way it is. While the way the handled the Paul Walker storyline (or rather his characters) might have blinded some people (for the better concerning the movie, it's tough not to be emotionally involved especially with one particular song that sums things up), the movie itself closes its page on a chapter ... but makes sure you know there is more to come.A lot of crazy stunts and a Tony Jaa who is actually fitting in the small role he has (something that unfortunately can't be said about his role in Skin Trade). So overall more than a decent effort and if you give the movie special points of how they treated Paul Walkers character (apart from the bad CGI that is), you might feel it deserves an even higher rating.",7,0,15,8 July 2015
The Godfather," And so it begins
","The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show 'Sopranos'. But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn't hold back.The performances are awesome and I can't wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I'll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don't agree with the way the 'family' functions (and you shouldn't agree with it of course, just saying)",10,2,5,4 February 2013
