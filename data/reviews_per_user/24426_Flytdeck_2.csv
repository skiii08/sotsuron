Mission: Impossible III," Good entertainment
","For the action/thriller/explosion type individual, this movie has a 'credible' story line and enough tension to keep viewers on the edge of their seats for the entire movie. I quite enjoyed the entire show. Tom Cruise is quite up to snuff once more for 'hard' action and the visual conflict effects are quite stunning. Would have liked to see more 'gadgets' but, I suppose a story line is mandatory. Now waiting anxiously for the sequel, including Michelle Monaghan who is an enticing and believable actress. With luck, this franchise will evolve and continue to offer solid entertainment value and new 'twists' in this genre.",8,3,4,4 October 2006
American Beauty," Of passing interest only
","To enjoy this movie, you need to identify with one of the characters.  If you don't fall into one of the four overly defined typecasts, the movie becomes a conglomerate of self-centred fixations.  If, however, you are undergoing or anticipating undergoing a mid-life crisis, by all means, go see the show!",4,0,0,11 November 1999
