The Longest Yard," i want my hour back...
","I find it very hard to comprehend how so many people could find this mind numbing pathetic excuse for a goddamn movie remotely entertaining... Well I should take that back, there were a few funny catch phrases that Chris Rock uttered, but in his typical fashion every joke he made was about the 'black man' and the 'white boy'... c'mon Chris Rock, it's called new material, you should look into that... Anyways, with how absurd and unbelievable the entire movie was; it resulted in being nothing but a complete disappointment in my book. And to spare you a summary of all the points in the movie that Bill Goldman came up short, which was the entire movie... my recommendation is that you spare yourself and don't see it...",1,7,15,30 May 2005
