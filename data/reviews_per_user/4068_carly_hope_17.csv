Sucker Punch," It is a Sucker Punch All Right!
","I went to see the movie because of Vanessa Hudgens. and was left with an unforgettable experience.the opening wordless sequence beautifully sets what you should expect of the movie but would probably never do. and I love the idea they came up with for showing the title.this is a very well thought out story even if it is first and foremost an action movie. watching this movie is like putting together a puzzle with thousand pieces. until you place in the very last one you don't really know what you are looking at.visually it is an incredible ride through several very different universes always underlined by amazingly chosen music. it would be very easy to just sit back and enjoy that aspect but there is more to this movie and that is the reason I had tears in my eyes when the closing credits rolled on.the acting was also very good. I don't think anyone from the cast will be nominated for an Oscar for their performances but given where the movie took place and what it was about, it was pitch perfect.this movie is a ride that I immensely enjoyed. if you give it a chance Im sure you would too",10,6,13,3 April 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Breathtaking, Overwheling and .. yeah, Funny!
","first I would say what bothered me a bit on the movie - the action, some of the scenes where a little over the top.and now what I liked: everything. from Orlandos wet and tempting back through the effects to Jack. it was beautiful and it was over almost in a flash. I was hearing that it is quite long but I didn't have the impression. the first one definitely felt longer. the acting was great, though the best one was yet again Johnny Depp, his presence wasn't as strong as in the first movie thanks to bigger concentration on the sidekicks - I especially appreciated Ragetti and Pintel. Elizabeth had definitely a bigger part and Stelan Skarsgard was just incredible. I didn't recognize Bill Nighy but his performance was flawless as always. Orlando was great - I especially liked his eyes, but didn't have a lot of space. the tricks are incredible and unbelievable. much better then in the first one - there is definitely more of them. the plot is not bad either and the fun is still there - so much of it, especially concerning the rum :) but what I probably liked the most is the music. it is a work of genius. it suited the film perfectly. applause to Hans Zimmer. I recommended, strongly and cant wait to see the ending.",9,2,5,16 August 2006
Brokeback Mountain," I love the movie
",I was looking forward to see it but I was not sure what to expect. and I definitely did not get what I expected. what I got was a beautiful love story. perfectly written and portrayed. with incredible music. with lyrical pictures occasionally interrupted by a bit of cruel realism.Ang Lee is an artist. and the camera job is incredibly well done. the difference between the quiet peace of the solitude of Brokeback Mountain and the struggle of the world they are coming back to is perfectly underlining the difference of the world of 'could be' and the world of 'is'. the movie tells a story but here the picture is much more important then the words. because sometimes you have to see to understand. you may call the movie whatever you like I stick with love story. because this movie shows the beauty love can create and the pain and destruction that hatred and fear bring along.,10,20,24,28 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," It is just more
","it has more action, more old friends, more fun, more effects, more romance, more surprises first of all big applause to the whole cast. Orlando and Keira got to act more and were wonderful - and Will as the new captain was also hot :). we got to meet some all friends although some of them only briefly and also some old enemies. Tom Hollander was brilliant in his last scene. Keith Richards only had 2 scenes but he was great. Pintell and Ragetti were entertaining as always. the return of Goeffrey Rush was with blazing guns and Chow Yun-fat fits in just right. and there is also Johnny. that doesn't really need further commentary.the opening scene was cruel but touching and the story really great. it was nice to see that the characters weren't just pawns in Jacks chess game but had the chance to make their own moves. although ultimately everything went according to his plan - as always. the ending is just screaming for a sequel and it was in a true Jack Sparrow fashion.there was more fun but it was also darker. the last fight was just perfect and there was also the beautiful wedding - not that I would want a one like that but it was in the right moment. the effects were flawless.the music is again a work of genius. I think I love Hans Zimmer.it is a wonderful movie and I can only recommend it and definitely stay for the end of the credits. the final scene is cheesy and pretty much predictable but oh so worth it",10,22,37,31 May 2007
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Not an origin movie but a story of growth
","What this movie could have done with less of is Tony Stark. It served mostly to remind me why I find him incredibly irritable and annoying. He hijacked the growing Peter had done in the story mostly to cover the fact he screwed up. Because Peter mostly needed attention and a little nudge in the right direction. Not someone to tear him down. But most of the great things Peter had done happened because he is a genuinely good person and often happened despite Tony not thanks to him. Though that last scene with Happy and Pepper was fun.Tom played the young man who was promised greatness and then was left hanging and who was trying to find his place in the world - both regular and superhero one, with a lot of heart and a lot of charm. Especially the whole part since he found out Volture's identity and the subsequent fight. He was also sufficiently snarky and funny. And I love how they managed to capture the fact he is just a teenager, eager and over-enthusiastic at times, with lot of growing to do but definitely on the right track.His schoolmates were also well portrayed, I especially enjoyed Flash, Ned and Zendaya was simply splendid as MJ. They laid a very nice groundwork for a potential relationship as well as flashing her out as her own character.The villain of the story was interesting as well. Someone who stepped to the wrong side of law out of necessity, something that is not that hard to identify with. It makes him sympathetic even if you do ultimately want him to lose.Marisa as aunt May was interesting as well. There were moments were she felt kinda out of place and in others their moments with Peter were beyond lovely. Also, kudos for the representation race-wise. It was refreshing. Overall, it was a fun movie, it tied nicely to Civil War, introduced the characters and made me eager for more.",8,16,28,8 July 2017
She's the Man," It was funny...but it was not enough
","I have mixed feelings about this movie. I like the idea cause I really like 'Twelfth Night'. and they did a good job. it was really funny. but something was missing and I don't know what. I really enjoyed the over-the-top performance of Amandy Bynes. and Channing Tatum is simply hot. and can act as well. I simply adored him being all shy around 'Olivia'. but for some reason Amanda as Sebastian had much more chemistry with Channing then Amanda as Viola. maybe it was intended this way. there was not much of football in it which I didn't mind but there wasn't much of anything else. just another proof that Amanda is an incredible physical comedian. and that Channing should think of making few more comedy movies himself. what I really didn't like was the 'revelation' it was way too pathetic. even for an American movie. I must mention the supporting cast, they were simply brilliant. the headmaster cutting roses and serving lunch in cafeteria. the not-so-divorced parents. the supportive friends of Viola - I love Paul. but the best one was definitely the coach of Iliria. just for him I would give this movie 10 points. but I cant.",6,1,1,11 October 2006
Enchanted," Enchanting
","Enchanted really is enchanting. it is a fairy tale and its corny and predictable. but it is also sweet, funny and magical. its not so much about two worlds colliding but more of the two different worlds merging together.the plot is quite simple but it is a fairy tale after all, and they are not supposed to be complicated. it also has a Disney moral which is wonderfully true.it has a wonderful cast. Patrick Dempsey as a closeted romantic hiding behind a sober and cynical mask. Amy Adams is innocent and childlike but beautiful in a fairy tale kind of way and you believe easily Robert would fall for her. James Marsden is perfect as narcissistic and slightly dumb Prince Charming. and Susan Sarandon, she is the Wicked Witch with Class.then there are the songs. now I finally understand all the Oscar nomination. they are simply beautiful. I couldn't choose a favorite if I wanted to.so what is the verdict? well, its nice to be able to believe, even if it is only for two hours.",9,2,2,21 February 2008
Avengers: Endgame," Just like cotton candy
","The more I think about this movie the more disappointed I am. And the more I try to pretend it never happened.In the cinema I was sort of swept in all the pictures but as pretty as they were, they don't really hold up very well under closer scrutiny. They are like cotton candy, it looks really nice, is very sweet but in the end, it's just sugar.There was very little substance and they tried to fill the movie with surprises and twists and the unexpected to hide it. And they kind of failed.There were some story points that were handled very well. Some that could be hand-waved into appreciation. And then some that were just straight up terrible - e.g. the whole Steve's story line.After all the build up in the previous movies, this movie was kind of a let down.And my question stands: What about Bucky?",6,0,3,28 April 2019
Twilight," Where have the Romance gone?
","Im not disappointed but Im not thrilled either.I loved the actors who did quite the job (well maybe except for Taylor whose too bright smile and terrible wig were quite distracting just like Nikki herself). especially Billy Burke was awesome. and I couldn't take my eyes away from Rob. but the script was so confusing. some of the things were said just for the sake of saying them, without any consecution or sometimes even sense. and then there were funny and very well put scenes and it was irritating. the same problem I had with directing. I wish all the scene were as awesome as the baseball scene, as beautiful as the prom scene or as dazzling as the conversation with Bella, Edward, Angela and Jessica in front of the restauranta lot of emphasis was put on the mystery and on the action. and it worked quite well. but the romantic undertone that was the most important part of the story was missing. Rob and Kris have amazing chemistry but other then that it was sometimes hard to comprehend why they would fall had over heels for each other. other times it was hard to see the love at all. they were barely touching. there were no sweet gestures to show us how important the other one is, thing the book is basically built on. this is even sadder given the fact that the few really couple-y scene they had were beyond awesome.it seems that Im only complaining but there was another part that I liked and that was the music. it was very well chosen especially the two songs by Rob and also Linking Park.it was just like watching HP again. the casting was great, the visual was breathtaking but the emphasis was on the wrong things. at least for me. but I liked it still. I was just expecting a little more of a love story.",9,0,5,30 November 2008
Magic Mike XXL," A Movie for Women
","This was such a lovely, fun and feminist movie. Its main objective was to bring a smile to woman's face and make her feel appreciated and worshiped. And the movie managed it. For the Kings of Tampa, more than the last ride, this was a way to escape their mold and create their own path. To face their dreams outside of the stage. It was really great to get to know the characters more and to see their friendship. It is clear the boys spent some time not only in the gym but also in a dance studio in preparation for this movie. And it was appreciated. A lot :)I love how this movie concentrated more on showing the stripping is for the woman. And while I don't think I would feel comfortable in those situations, it was clear the women enjoyed being cherished and it was also wonderful to see so many different women and different ways appreciation can be shown. I also liked the character of Rome and Jada did a wonderful job with her. She was all about the women. This is a movie for women in a way that very few movies are. And that is why women should go to see it. For pleasure. And men should go see it as well. For education.",10,10,19,23 July 2015
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," It gets better with each movie.
","I will start with what was great in all the previous movies and that is casting. our old friends did yet again a great job. Oliver & James and their grand departure were simply splendid. Heartbroken Bonnie was so touching. the banter between Rupert and Emma batter then ever. and Daniel - he was simply wonderful. since Harry practically carries this story on his shoulders he was asked to do a lot and he held out, with honors. the adults didn't have as much space as before but were incredible as usual.the new additions to cast were perfect. Imelda was unbelievable as the sweet cruel and fanatic new teacher and Helena played the crazy Bellatrix with gusto. but the one that truly shined on screen was Evanna. the girl from a different place, her mind never really present but so indispensable.as for the story there was lot missing from the book and the ones who didn't read it might be confused at times but as an ending result it is a pretty compact tale. humor is another thing that makes the books so unique and it was there, carefully portioned in between all the darkness, insecurities and fear.the editing on this one was great too. sometimes the pictures flowed like a stream, calm and peaceful, other times the sequences changed in a video clip fashion and every time in the right moment.this movie, however had what I missed in the previous ones the most - a great finale. the anticipation was built perfectly and exploded into a battle that was long enough to not disappoint or get lost among the other scenes.the fact that David Yates is directing the next movie too thrills me to no end.so what is the conclusion? it was funny, it was breathtaking, it was heartbreaking, it was magical.",10,0,1,18 July 2007
La La Land," Great pretender
","It is flashy and colorful and the acting is good - the dancing and singing not so much, some of the music is really well placed if forgettable. But it is a movie that pretends for 128 minutes to be something it is not. It is not a musical. It tries to be. But it forgets 20 minutes in and then remembers in the end for one wonderful classical musical scene that would be brilliant if it was all that La La Land was. But the rest, is not really a musical. Mostly because while it doesn't lack music it lacks music numbers. And the ones it has feel mostly out of place and there only so a bland love story can be called something more interesting. It is a movie with music. Not particularly good music either. There are two numbers that stuck with me for longer then the length of the movie. The rest might work within the story but doesn't manage to stand on its own.The movie also pretends to be original. Which it is not. There has been stories like that. And better ones. The characters are not sympathetic either. He is snobbish and self-centered and even in his growth remains a jerk. She has no idea what she wants and while she pretends to grow she remains a child. If the actors were any less charming and worked less well together I would be rooting for them to get slapped for half the movie. It made caring if they stay together or not and watching their struggles and their happy moments much less involved. And uninvolved audience is not something you are striving for as a story teller. And the ending of the movie, don't even let me start on that. I was somewhat looking forward to it despite the movie's flaws and then the movie slapped me in the face and spit on itself and me as well. I ended up feeling lied to and took for a fool. I have seen two wonderful movies that same week and going out of La La Land it was everything a movie should not make you feel. Disappointed. Mislead. Empty. Just like the movie is.",2,24,43,24 January 2017
Wonder Woman," It passed the Bechdel test!
","And that definitely isn't the only positive about this wonder-movie. It is a well told origin story. It tells us where Diana is coming from, how she became who she is and why she's doing what she's doing. It paints a very clear picture. It makes you invested. Diana is the main focus but we get a sense of who the main supporting characters are as well. Especially Steve Trevor who is treated way better by the script than his female counterparts from similar movies. I really liked the merry band of misfits accompanying Diana on her quest. They gave both a face and perspective to the war and to humanity. Etta was my favorite. The casting was amazing as well. Gal Gadot gave Diana strength, certain arrogance coming from trusting one's abilities but also innocence, naivety and vulnerability. Chris Pine was charming as a spy should be while not threatened at all by Diana's abilities and his feelings for her. And the Big Bad? Maybe I should have figured it out on my own but I like surprises, so why bother. They were sufficiently threatening and it was easy to understand and fear their monstrosity. The action sequences were really cool as well. Though there were a couple of instances where the CGI was a little too on the nose. My favorite was the very first fight on the beach. So beautiful and heartbreaking. Visually it was also very appealing. The costumes, scenery, camera work. And also the music was well picked. Overall, it was everything one could wish for from such a movie. Compelling story-telling, interesting multi-dimensional characters, humor and emotions, stunning visuals. Well done, girls, well done.",10,9,23,5 June 2017
Step Up," A promise kept
","this movie was maybe not promising much but it kept every single thing. it had some great music in it which accompanied some pretty good dancing. it had good looking and talented people in it. singers, dancers, actors. it had a simple story but it was told very well. it was full of clichés but most of the time I just didn't mind. it was funny. the best was definitely the annoyed little ballerina girl. and tights. and it had this really steamy love story. Channing and Jenna look great together whether they are dancing, kissing or simply pretending they don't care. and the rest of cast was really good too. the movie was visually great and as entertainment A+",8,0,2,27 September 2006
The Greatest Showman," Surpasing great expectations
","I was really loking forward to this movie. And it did not dissapoint. To the contrary. It made me feel like I could fly. The first draw for me was the cas., Hugh, Zendaya, Zac. And they were magnificent. Just like the rest of the colorful magical ensamble. The story was maybe simple but important. Still. Because different is indeed better. Family is what you make of it. Your dreams are worth fighting for. And love is worth risking it all for. The visuals were wonderful. So much color and such well crafted numbers. They were all breathtaking. And the very best part of it all, the music. It is the blood that runs through the movie, bringing it to life. It is strong and hopefull and hopeless and it allows to loose oneself in teh fantasy Phineas and the movie with him, weave around every spectator. Truly, the greatest.",10,1,3,9 January 2018
Speed," Get in and get ready for the ride
",I inhaled at the beginning and exhaled after the credits started to role. there was not one dull moment in the movie. the proportion of action scenes and calmer moments was just right. it had some drama in it and also humor. the acting was great. not only the leads but also the supporting cast was really good. Dennis Hopper was eccentric and crazy. Jeff Daniels and Keanu Reeves made a good team but I definitely prefer the Keanu-Sandra teaming. their on-screen chemistry is explosive. and their little romance growing between all the speeding and exploding is just the last touch to make this movie perfect. what more to say. this movie is a classic.,10,1,2,14 September 2006
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Holy Leg Hitch, Batman!
","what I liked about the movie: Rob & Kris - they were perfection both apart but mostly together. its like Edward was finally allowed to just be everything he really was. and their together scenes? they just nailed it. so spot on. not a one thing amiss Edward/Bella - finally they seemed like a couple in love. the glimpse I got in NM was in full bloom here. this was the couple I fell in love with. the tenderness, the banter, the passion, the love. and the leg hitch ... oh my Edward, the leg hitch Billy Burke - he is the best written character in the movies and he nails it every single time. I don't like Charlie much but Billy is effing fantastic Jackson - he was perfect. so spot on. his acting even overshadowed the terrible wig. and that accent ;) and the horse-riding Jasper/Alice - they were so cute. there were little glimpses in the first movie but here they were just everything I always believed them to be. and those two kisses. so perfect Kellan/Emmett - finally. I think Kellan was a great choice for Emmett and here finally he got to be the always teasing and ready to fight teddy bear I love Xavier - yummy. and a job very well done BooBoo - I so wish there was more of him. there better be in BD. because he was so perfectly cast fight scenes - yeah, those were awesome. not too long, visually stunning, very well acted visuals - I loved that it wasn't all bluish like Twilight. that it had warmth and glow but also the darkness and cold. it suited the story and its different aspects.the things I didn't like: Jacob/Taylor - Taylors acting wasn't as terrible as I feared but he is so very much one dimensional. like he only has that one layer of superior and slightly bored smugness and he acts with it in every single scene. or he is overplaying the dramatic scenes. and I will admit, I cringed and closed my eyes during most of his scenes. some weren't that bad but if I could get my hands on a cut of the movie where the Jacob part sans EB are cut out I so would Bryce as Victoria - I like Bryce but I missed Rachelle. maybe if Bryce got the part from the beginning it would have been different but this way it felt really disconnected and she lacked the fierceness I associated with Victoria too much newborns - they were cool and it was good to see it but it was a little too much. it was one of the things that kinda hindered the flow of the story when we were constantly thrown back to things we didn't really need to know pacing - especially at the beginning the movie seemed to skip instead of flow. it got better towards the end but the beginning was kinda distracting alternations - not all of them. but some. like MR butchering my favorite line of the movie. and I felt they were a little heavy on the moments where Bella would realize all the things she would have to sacrifice. it was too in your face. a little more subtlety would do it good. and her final monologue about her reasons for changing. while I can understand and agree with the overall sentiment of it, the wording was poor and very much opposed to what the story actually isover all it was better then I expected and it finally seem to do the characters justice. but I still think that the script is the weakest point of these movies and I don't understand why Melissa Rosenberg is still writing them",8,6,18,2 July 2010
