Miracle," Fantastic
","I saw the film at a special preview in Las Vegas (tickets were given to people who showed up early, in hockey gear to the local ECHL team a few days before the showing).  The film was not so much a bash of the Soviets (as some have suggested), but about a team who represented their country during a period of bleak news.  The country was in a recession, with double-digit inflation and interest rates, gas shortages, a weak president (Carter) who essentially told us our best days were behind us, and a Soviet enemy who appeared to be winning the cold war (taking Afghanistan) and dominated Olympic hockey.  The team gave the United States a huge booster shot in a bleak period.  If we could beat the Soviets on the ice (where they dominated the world), maybe we could also triumph over the other challenges we faced.
The values of the story are hard work, dedication to a team instead of individual glory, and determination to beat big odds to win.  Was the team underestimated?  Probably, but they were underestimated because nobody thought a coach could push them into being the best conditioned team, and into refusing to be intimidated by the Soviets.  A scene, probably included for dramatic effect was Herb pushing the players hard until one of them finally gave him the right answer to 'Who do you play for?'.  Instead of his college team (the answer previous given by all players who were asked the question), he responded 'The United States of America'.",Null,0,0,5 February 2004
Spider-Man 2," The PRICE of a Hero
","Sacrifice. Peter Parker gave up much when he chose a life of responsibility as Spider-Man. His best friend now holds him in contempt because of his 'relationship' with Spider-Man (photographer). The girl he loves has moved on, and is marrying another man. His Aunt May is destitute, and forced into selling her home. Peter himself is completely stressed by his dual life; unable to keep a job or up with his studies.Choice. Can life be better for Peter? Doesn't he deserve a life as Peter Parker? With his powers failing, can abandoning the role of Spider-Man make life better for Peter Parker? Indeed, it can. Refusing to shoulder the world's burdens anymore makes life better for him. However, it is far from perfect, as his Aunt still faces financial trouble, Mary Jane is still marrying another man, and even a trial by fire shows he still can't take on the world't burdens alone - or get perfect results.Destiny. In the end, nobody can avoid their destiny. Peter eventually finds redemption as a hero, taking a terrible beating to save many innocents, who recognize the hero he is, even if he's just a kid. Harry Osborn finds himself confronted with demons too terrible to face as he begins his path toward a dark future. Mary Jane finds her destiny after a long trail of false paths. In the end, secrets are revealed - and many characters proceed to make choices based on those secrets. Is Peter just Peter, his he Spider-Man, or can there possibly be a balance between his two lives? Is Harry Peter's friend or Spider-Man's enemy - and what mirror to the past clouds his future? What about Mary Jane - doesn't she deserve some kind of informed choice about her own destiny?Oh, what about Doctor Octopus? A villain to be sure, but really only a vehicle to clarify the struggles of the main characters. The story is about the inner conflicts of the main characters, and while Octopus has his own demons to battle (and serves as an excellent person to foce the conflicts), his role is almost incidental other than that. An extremely good sequel that develops the characters while providing entertainment - and setting up the next films in the series.",Null,0,0,30 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions
","The seeds are sown for the ultimate coup for Episode 3.  Like Episode 1, the Dark Side moves in shadows, with deception and lies that further his dark agenda while seeming to be in the best interests of the Republic.  This time, the agenda is not to gain political power, with Darth Sideous already has, but to gain control of a military force he can use to enforce his rule on the galaxy.  Separatists, including the Trade Federation are striking to rebel against Republic Control with a huge army of even more advanced battle droids.  But there is a possible salvation; another huge army of clones grown at the order of a dead Jedi Knight over 10 years ago - clones grown supposedly for the Republic!While Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi seeks to uncover the mystery, and capture the source of the clone army, a bounty hunter named Jango Fett, the Jedi council realizes how deeply the dark side is clouding their ability to use Jedi visions to foresee events.Meanwhile, young Padawan Anakin Skywalker receives his first independent assignment:  the protection of former Queen, now Senetor Padme Amadala, who, as the chief opponent of a Republic Army, finds herself the target of a plot to kill her.  Unfortunately, his reunion with her stirs feelings of love and passion, which are forbidden to the Jedi.  Worse still, his dreams of his mother in pain and suffering lead Anakin to return to Tattooine in a desperate attempt to find her.  No more direct comments, but master Yoda stated it best.  'Afraid to lose her are you?  Fear leads to anger.  Anger leads to hate.  Hate leads to suffering.'  Some of the seeds for his descent into a Sith lord who is more machine than man are firmly planted.Side note.  It is clear that Anakin is the chosen one who will bring balance to the force.  Jedi fade and the ability to become one with the force, while still retaining a sense of self was unknown to Jedi before this time, and Anakin opened the door for this, very slightly, in this episode.  Obi-Won will understand it eventually, allowing himself to be struck down to allow Luke and company to escape, while still being able to guide him.Final note.  Don't underestimate Yoda.  He is wise, and kindly, and a good trainer of Jedi, not to mention a master who can gain insights into the force unlike most others.  However, he is a true master of the force, and if pressed, the kindly teacher of the ways of the Jedi is a dangereous and deadly opponent if forced into battle.  For knowledge and defense, a Jedi uses his power for.  Short he may be, but don't underestimate his ability as a Jedi.",Null,0,0,18 May 2002
Spider-Man," A Worthy Adaptation
","Spider-Man produced a film that was highly faithful to the spirit of the comic books and the evolution of the character.  He was initially selfish with his powers, learning about them and neglecting his chores, and then using them to beat the bullying Flash Thompson in a fight.  The wrestling match was a part of comic lore, but it was nicely condensed into both his desire to impress M.J. (getting money to buy a car), and refusing to stop the burgler that killed his uncle after he was cheated out of his rightful winnings.  After that, he used his powers unselfishly; fighting crime and protecting the innocent.On the flip side, we have Norman Osborn, and his evolution into the Green Goblin.  He also gained great power, but used them to defeat his business rivals and murder the board of directors who were going to sell out his company and fire him.  Granted, he was insane, but it was the risk he took to further his own agenda.  Predictably, it put him at odds with Spider-Man, and as in tradition, learned Peter's secret, and used it against the people he loved best.To round out the cast, we have Harry Osborn, Peter's best friend, who wrongly blames Spider-Man for his father's death (and sets the stage for his eventual decent into madness and the role of the second Green Goblin), and Mary Jane Watson.  A confused girl from an abusive household, she eventually realized she'd had crushes on the wrong men her entire life.  Flash was a bully, Harry wouldn't stand up for her, and even in the end, the heroic Spider-Man wasn't the right man for her.  She realized it was Peter, who didn't care if she was poor and waiting tables, who truly cared for her, and she for him.  In the closing scene, she almost certainly guessed his secret (from both Peter's words to her, and her expression and the way she felt her lips... she'd been kissed like that before).Other fun features were the short appearances of the Daily Bugle staff, the crime scene notes (compliments of your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man), and even a reference to Dr. Conners (a scientist who eventually becomes the villain The Lizard).What would I like to see in a sequel?  MJ confessing her knowledge of Peter's secret to him, more of the Daily Bugle staff, and a single villain (unlike most super-hero sequels, which tend to feature villain team-ups); preferably Doctor Octopus.  Doc Ock is probably Spidey's foremost nemesis, and it would be nice to see how that megalomaniac tries to turn four extra arms into world dominiation.",Null,0,0,5 May 2002
