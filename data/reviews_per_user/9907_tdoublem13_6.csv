Angels & Demons," Not so good remake of a great Book
","I came into this movie with high expectations, hoping it wouldn't stray too far from the book version. However, at the end of the movie, I was completely disappointed. The basic plot may have been the same, but there was a lot of contrast between the movie version and the book version: I recorded them and here they are:(1) Kohler wasn't in the movie at all! In my mind, he played a major part in the whole discovery of Vittoria Vetra's father, but he was completely excluded from the movie, as was the way her father was found changed. He also did not surface to expose the carmelango, another important role of his. I found myself wishing for his presence in the movie.(2) The LHC project of the Vetra and her partner/priest?? was by no means a secret project, as portrayed in the book.(3) The movie didn't make it clear how the Illuminati symbol played into the movie, making me wonder it's relation. In the book, it was clear that the symbol had been branded on Vetra's chest, but in the movie no such thing was shown clearly.(4) In the book, St. Peter's Square is said to be devoid of much media or bystanders, but in the movie the whole square is filled from the very beginning of conclave with dozens of news teams and a plethora of worshipers.(5) Where was Gunther Glick? Come on!(6) There were no fight scenes between Langdon and the Hassasin, nor was the Hassasin portrayed as very evil, as he was in the book. He has three fights with the Hassasin, which, after reading the book, I was really looking forward to seeing them come alive in the movie. However, they were completely left out and instead of Vittoria killing the Hassassin, his car blew up? Yeah, I didn't get how that tied in or who blew it up. Another unnecessary point of change.(7) Vittoria was never taken hostage.(8) Commander Richter (whoever that was) is the scapegoat for the carmelangos' plans, unlike Kohler in the book. I didn't really get how this played in at all, and I had no clue who Commander Richter was anyway.(9) There was no love connection between Langdon and Vetra. Come on! This could have been portrayed so amazingly in the movie, but they choose to leave it out?! What were they thinking?(10) Langdon doesn't go up in the helicopter, nor does he find the incriminating video from Kohler or even from Commander Richter.(11) The coolest symbol of all is not included, but instead is..... keys? What?(12) The ending is different, the carlemango's death is different, the elected pope is different (apparently the last cardinal of the preferiti is saved by Langdon).(13) This is out of order, but the scene between Langdon and the Hassasin was totally left out. This was a really important fight and an important part of the book, I thought, and it was totally left out.Some of these differences might seem insignificant, but in my view they really changed the plot for the worse. As is often with remakes of good books, the movies can't hold up to the great plots of the book. I think in this case, the book was a lot better than the movie. For that reason, and some others having to do with the constant action, confusion caused by the 'new plot' of the movie among others, (5/10).",5,2,3,8 April 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Dramatic and Fitting Conclusion to the Bourne Trilogy
","Another score for the Bourne Trilogy. The previous movies have been good. This movie is better. By far in my opinion the best of the Bourne series. We again see the same continuation and finally the ending point of the Jason Bourne story. And yes, you do finally learn of Bourne's endings in this movie.As for basic outline of the movie, it is simply an extension of the great style of the other Bourne movies. Less concentration on the 'cliche' action movie things, like explosions and women and more concentration on the actors and their involvement in the story.The Bourne series comes to a shocking end that makes this movie a must-see for Bourne junkies and completes a great trilogy.

The Bourne Identity," One of the Best Spy-Thrillers Out
","What makes an action movie good? Is it the special effects? The explosions? The exotic women? The fancy gadgets? The Bourne series puts these questions to the test. There are almost no special effects in this movie. There are no explosions in this movie. There are no particularly 'sexy' women in this movie. There are no gadgets in the movie. On the contrary, the computers used by the CIA look like computers that were around in 2004. But I would like to put it out there that 'The Bourne Identity' is one of the best spy-thrillers ever released.The Bourne series is really a blatant winning movie. It's gripping, it's confusing just to the perfect level where the audience has to keep watching to understand the plot. At the end of the movie, we want to know who this man we've come to know as Jason Bourne is.I think we as an audience should challenge ourselves to challenge Hollywood to make more movies like this. Movies that don't rely on that 'WOAH!' factor. Movies that can make it, and be great movies, without sex, gore and violence.For you action junkies out there, don't let this review fool you. There is still action in this movie. The multiple fight scenes, while not filling the movie, are interesting and faced-paced. I firmly recommend this as a must-see movie and a must-see series for anyone who enjoys action movies.",8,2,2,16 March 2011
Paranormal Activity," I wasn't Scared
","I heard people raving on about how great 'Paranormal Activity' was, so I decided to check it out one day. I'm into horror movies but only to poke fun at them. I rarely am scared by horror movies, and if I am scared, that film gets in my good graces. I was told by a few that this movie was a new, fresh genre of horror (though it looked awfully similar to BWP).At first sight, the movie is, of course having a $15k budget, simple. I enjoyed the first-person home-video feel, although that is becoming more and more popular with the horror industry. However, while the realistic approach might appeal to the fearful nature of a few, it did not particularly affect me. Unfortunately, the movie really had few scary moments. It was rather cliché. Demons, getting pulled from a bed, an exorcist-type person unable to remove the demons, doors slamming shut. I will give it credit for the last 20 minutes or so, it was a tad scary, and I use 'tad' lightly. I was very surprised at the last minute or so, when the girl killed the man, so I applaud the creators for that moment of surprise that was completely unexpected. I expected something completely different. I had a problem with the cut-off ending, and it gave me and almost 'Cloverfield' feel. I have not yet watched the 2nd Paranormal Activity, but I hope it ties up some endings. There were a few problems: 1) Not scary enough (Probably just a problem with my messed up sense of horror) 2) I found myself getting a bit bored at parts. 3) The abruptness of the ending.But, I did like a few things: 1) The acting felt very natural and not scripted. 2) The surprise ending.For these reasons, I give this movie a 4/10.",4,0,1,29 May 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," Hope Sets you Free
","This is now the 2,340th Review of this Title. However, I'm still writing it because this movie deserves to be written about. It really exceeds the 10/10 scale. An awe-inspiring story of hope, this is just one of those movies that you know you still want to watch in 20 years. The movie premise itself at first sight doesn't seem like it will be all that interesting. However, from the first minutes, you realize the superior writing, acting and cinematography unrivaled I would say by any other film I've seen. Throughout the movie, I find myself constantly connected to the characters, wishing that the warden would overcome his cold-hearted nature and concede to let our antagonist, Andy free from the torment that was The Shawshank Prison. I almost let out an audible sob when Tommy was shot. If you're looking for something to bring you up, to give you hope, you've come to the right place. This movie is probably the most soul-touching piece of two and half hour film out there, encompassing friendship, suffering, hope, and freedom. This movie is really what I believe that this should serve as the model for Hollywood. It's about time that they learn that for a movie to be good, it doesn't need excessive gore, or explosions on screen, or special effects, or sex scenes or any of what comes with the modern-day Hollywood production. This movie is pretty simple. Just men talking. If you haven't seen this movie yet, now the #1 movie on the IMDb leader boards, you don't know what you're missing. A must see for anybody and everybody of age. (10/10)",10,0,0,18 March 2011
The Bourne Supremacy," A Continuation of a Great Series with a Minor Issue
","For anybody who enjoyed 'The Bourne Identity', this is a satisfying sequel. Nowadays, sequels to movies are getting better than the movies themselves. This is no exception.More of the same from what we saw with 'The Bourne Identity'. Less concentration on the flashy, what we've come to associate with action-esque scenes and more concentration on the drama unfolding behind the plot. The writers may have broken a bit from their status-quo when they had Bourne blow up the house, sending numerous officers flying as he walked away from the building (typical clichÃ© action movie scene), but still a great mix of fighting scenes and car chases with perfectly placed 'less interesting' plot-building scenes.One minor issue I had with the movie didn't arise from the plot or the story-line, but from the camera movement during action scenes. I had to actually pause this movie three or four times during these scenes just to get my head straight. Perhaps it's a style choice, but I prefer to be able to see what's going on during fight and car chase scenes.(8/10). Also a must see, especially if you saw the 1st of the Bourne Series.",8,3,4,16 March 2011
