Mission: Impossible III," The Return to Adventure
","Third time's a charm. When the first notes of the Mission Impossible theme music hit my ears, I knew we were onto something special. Gone were the techno-beats. We were back to Lalo Schriffin's original theme from the 70's series. This is the return to innocence and simplicity. And it worked...Mi3 is more of an adventure tale, realistic and grimy - none of the fantasising of John Woo, less of the blinking of techno-gadgets. There is no Lone Ranger here - Ethan Hawke works as a team, as it should be. He's also less of the super agent, but more vulnerable which keeps the audience spellbound. Its as if the audience had something to lose, rooting for his every move and holding their breaths when things don't go his way.Mission Accomplished!",8,0,1,5 May 2006
The Village," An Aura of Mystery
","This is a slow-burn movie, the ingredients are added to the fire a bit at a time (anxiety, romance and mystery) at just the right moment. The stars are splendid in their roles, and you have this evocative feeling of a lost world; of how things used to be in the age of innocence.I love the photography - at times the camera goes too close - invading your personal space. And that's where the fun begins. The music by James Newton Howard too is excellent, proding the scenes along when it needs to - but not too invasive, and you get enveloped in the atmosphere of the movie but not the music. This is slick film making. I give a it 7.5 out of 10.",Null,0,0,28 August 2004
Transformers," Excellent
","The first thing that jumps at you at the beginning of the movie is that ... this is not a kid's movie (Helicopter scene with the squad playfully bantering with each other in the first 3 minutes).The movie is militaristic and definitely adrenaline pumping. The scenes flow fluidly from one part to another, with little delay. You get pulled into the action, not merely the bystander.There is chemistry between the characters. There is comedy. There is tragedy. There's a lot of eye candy, no doubt! But what makes it work is the balance that puts all the elements together. Ultimately a Great Job!!",10,3,9,1 July 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Emptiness
","One word - emptiness.** Warning! Spoiler.You feel for Jason when Marie was hit. Well .... that's about it then.The rest of the film has Jason running around in Europe bouncing through his past.... again. The action sequences were not great but above average .... watchable. You get the impression that something is missing, and the story line is too loose and unfocused. Lose the shaking camera effect... it's overdone! ...surely you can afford a tripod some of the time!Bottom line 7.2 out of 10.",Null,0,1,14 August 2004
