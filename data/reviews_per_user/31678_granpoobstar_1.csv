Casablanca," Brilliant and Riveting
","OK, I admit it, I'm a sucker for all things Bogart. No, not all his movies stand out as masterpieces but among the actors who epitomize the Golden Age of Cinema, Bogart is at or near the top. That having been said, Casablanca stands apart. The story perfectly captures the complications and confusing ideals of the time. There are some characters who are clearly on the wrong side of good vs evil but so many of them (just like in life) are caught somewhere in the middle. Knowing what is right, and, doing what is right, becomes complicated. Casablanca is riveting cinema and stands as one of the top movies of all time. As with so many Golden Age movies, the acting is incredible and the pace is spot on. If you haven't seen this wartime classic, it's a must.",10,0,2,12 August 2016
