It," The more comedy than horror remake that worked
","This movie is based on Stephen King's book which was written back in 1986! As such it follows the trend of those amazing times - good storyline, interesting characters, amazing chemistry between them, surprisingly good acting and a remarkable build up of the scary scenes instead of sudden movements!
The humor worked so well, indeed it is a horror movie but you're going to end up laughing your ass off with this movie, it's a very funny movie where all the jokes landed!
Now addressing the second-rate part, there is not really a psychological horror, the special effects are not bad but there are points in this film where a should-be terrifying movie moment was kinda laughable!
Overall Andy Muschietti did an pretty amazing job with this film as well as Bill Skarsgard, who gave life to the terrifying Pennywise!",8,1,2,17 March 2018
Mother!," Absolutely horrible, worst movie of 2017.
","It sucks, it really sucks! Some critics are going to defend this movie, saying it is a piece of art! Art my ass!
Quoting a friend 'If you are an envolved person, and not your everyday unconscious zombie, you will avoid it'!
This is an absolute senseless movie going from nowhere to nowhere 2 freaking hours later! I can't really put into words how much i hated this crap movie! But i need to congratulate the effort by Jennifer Lawrence, she really did her best with the crap she was given!
There's nothing entertaining about the story or characters, it's a 2 hours movie of frustation waiting for it to end! 
And Darren Aronofsky next time you write a movie please don't read the bible prior to that. Thanks.",2,1,1,17 March 2018
