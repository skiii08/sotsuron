The Rock," Exciting, action-packed drama with believable characters.
","This film has all the elements of an action-packed drama as well as believable, true to life characters.  Nicolas Cage is excellent as a reluctant hero, we can relate to his fear and powerlessness at being drawn into a terrifying situation.Cage and Connery have a dynamic and interesting on-screen relationship, which is believable and touching and which gives the film pace.I particularly liked Ed Harris's portrayal of the 'villain' role as it showed him as a character with good and bad qualities instead of the usual 'evil' stereotype!  We also understand his actions through the story of his personal life leading up to the situation in the film.Definitely worth watching.",9,1,1,25 January 2001
