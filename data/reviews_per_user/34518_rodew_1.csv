Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Movie-making that delivers a great story
","***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***OK so if you are a fan of Vol 1, then the expectation for Vol 2 is for more action like the first and a final intense climactic fight scene where Bill dies and the Bride barely lives. What this movie delivers is the rest of the story while telling the whole story. I liked Kill Bill Vol 1 because of the superb fight scenes, the Bride's single-minded intensity for revenge, and the homage paid to the 70's kung fu/karate film genre. What I did not understand was who she was, how she got there and why was she beaten and left for dead. Bill's answer, 'I over-reacted', is as classic a movie line as ' dying ain't a good way to make a living' (outlaw josey wales). Kill Bill Vol 2 was a phenomenal adventure in story telling. I wish that there was more scenes with Pai Mei and the Bride training, I wish there was a scene were the Bride dismembers the pipsqueak who helped bury her alive, and honestly, a scene that defines or establishes Bill and the Bride's relationship (why did he choose her in the first place, especially over Vivica Fox and Lucy Liu who were much better looking). Also, the Bride carries significant respect around the world (the world's most dangerous woman), I appreciated knowing that near the end, but it would have been better to have that knowledge brought forth in some fashion, like Oren Ishii's anime story. I like Uma but I could not fathom how she could go from overdosed woman on the lawn (pulp fiction) to this uncanny killer (vol 1). Vol 2 brought this home for me.I thought the acting was exceptional by Madsen, Uma, and even Darryl Hannah (a long way from Splash). Superb scenes: the Hanzo sword in the golf bag; the bride walking across the street with dirt being blown off after digging her way out; the bride being blown away with rock salt(?)shotgun pellets; the cruel tutelage of Pai Mei; Elle reading about the Black Mamba venom as Budd writhes on the floor.Interesting plot lines: Budd selling the Bride's sword for 1 million; Budd not killing her with real shotgun shells; Budd taking that crap from that scummy owner; Budd disrespecting Elle before counting his money; how Elle is even still in the picture(was she a protege also, until she poisoned Pai Mei?); the brides name.Questionable: why guns in this movie?; how did the Bride know her baby was alive or what she looked like?; Samuel L. Jackson is wasted; when do we learn that The Bride is Black Mamba?; and most questionable- why did the Bride leave Bill in the first place?Her story seemed quite selfish, although it was superbly enacted in the movie. His answer, although incredibly long-winded, was helpful for me and I actually agreed with his other classic movie line, 'when a murderous bastard over reacts, what do you expect would happen'. Bill was saddened that the love of his life and his prized protege had died (or so he thought)and was angered to find her alive, due to give birth to their child, and getting married to a total loser. Chris Rock would say of Bill's actions: 'I don't agree with his tactics, but I can understand his mindset'Finally, as I did with Pulp Fiction, I assimilated the entire Kill Bill story in my mind and fashioned that, although the story telling is disjointed and incongruous, the story is utterly fascinating with a great moral: If you are going to kill the love of your life because you found out she did not die, but she just left you to have a baby and attempt to have a normal life, and she happens to be the most significantly dangerous, skillful, ruthless and cold-blooded assassin on the planet, then your days are numbered if she survives. As Budd states, another classic movie line: 'the woman deserves her revenge and we deserve to die'",10,0,1,13 November 2004
