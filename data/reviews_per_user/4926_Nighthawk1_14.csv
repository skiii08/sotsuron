"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," An amusing comedy that formulaic and predictable
","An amusing, but not fall out of your seat hilarious British comedy starring Simon Pegg.The movie is different in comparison to Simon Pegg's two cult hits Sean of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. It's pretty average and formulaic. There are some genuinely funny moments. Most of it is basically predictable and generic.It's also hard to root and cheer for a lead character who leaves his wife and unborn child at the alter in the beginning of the movie. Even if everything is leading towards some sort of redemption for the lead character.The movie is inhabited by the usual comic relief supporting characters. The cocky, arrogant and conceited new boyfriend. The big finale where Simon Pegg has to prove himself. It all can be seen way in advance.Run Fatboy Run is an adequate distraction that does have some entertainment value. It's just nothing to write home about.Directed by former Friends cast member David Schwimmer.",6,1,2,29 September 2008
Ford v Ferrari," Ford v Ferarri is an enjoyable old-fashioned crowd pleaser
","Ford v Ferrari is terrific. An old-fashioned movie but in a good way. A crowd pleaser. This is exactly the film movie studios don't make anymore. The race car scenes are authentic and exhilarating. The acting by Damon and Bale is spectacular and the friendship that grows between the two characters throughout the movie, going from competitors to friends, is enjoyable to watch. Movies like this are being released in theatres less and less so it's nice to see a drama aimed at adults in a movie theatre.",8,4,8,22 November 2019
Changeling," Intriguing premise, Compelling story
","An intriguing child abduction plot gives way to a compelling mystery drama and social commentary on the state of women's rights at the beginning of the 20th century.Angelina Jolie delivers a strong performance as the disconcerted and distressed mother. She's trying to figure out where her son went. Throughout the film Jolie's character is being deceived and lied to by the authorities and people in powerful positions who should be helping her. Jolie really knows how to cry well on cue. She can shed tears like a sprinkler system sprays water.Clint Eastwood's skillful and assured direction adds greatly to the film. The movie is expertly shot and proficiently rendered. It's easy to identify while watching that this movie is obviously helmed by an experienced veteran of his field. The film is not Clint Eastwood's best work. It's very good though. I did find that the film was a little too long and tended to drag a bit after while.Changeling is moving, heartwrenching and occasionally melodramatic. A satisfying, agreeable and rewarding movie experience.",7,4,7,8 November 2008
Inglourious Basterds," One of Quentin Tarantino's very best
","Even though Inglorious Basterds is not as good as Pulp Fiction, without a doubt it's one of Tarantino's very best. Quality wise it ranks near the top of his directing filmography. The biggest problem I have with the film is that it sometimes gets bogged down with self-indulgent dialogue that seems to cause the movie to drag. Other than this the movie works well and comes together perfectly in the end. Cristoph Waltz, in a breakout performance, is incredible as 'The Jew Hunter' Colonel Hans Landa. Brad Pitt is just having fun with his role, not taking it too seriously. An absolutely fantastic effort from Quentin Tarantino. Immensely entertaining and engaging.",9,1,7,17 November 2009
Oldboy," Oldboy worth watching
","I heard Oldboy was a movie that should not be missed. I couldn't agree any more with that statement. Don't let the simple premise fool you, this movie is quite complex. The visuals are innovative, and the various plot twists are unexpected. The final revelation especially caught me off guard. Also, two highlights that stood out for me were the octopus scene for its audacity and the corridor fight scene which was exceptional. The movie is far better than I expected. There is no way that the planned Hollywood remake will be as good or entertaining as the original. Oldboy is a cinematic achievement.Seek it out somehow if you desire an alternative to the more mainstream generic Hollywood movies that are available.",10,15,94,4 December 2004
The Irishman," Netflix Brings Martin Scorsese's epic vision into existence
","The Irishman is a swan song to the gangster film, and method actors of the past. A bygone era of filmmaking by a masterful legendary director. The de-aging technology is hard to adjust to at first but I got used to it.Netflix allows Martin Scorsese's The Irishman to exist by providing funding for the project other studios could not due to the limitations if their business model. They have to make break even to even start to make a profit, that with marketing costs makes major studios releasing films in theatres risk averse. Netflix is about subscribers and a limited run in theatres for dome of their films to qualify for awards.",9,2,7,30 November 2019
Yes Man," Yes Man lazy, predictable and somewhat dull. Not Jim Carrey's best effort.
","Jim Carrey is up to his usual comedic shtick in this lazy, predictable and somewhat dull comedy. Nothing new really goes on that I haven't seen before from Carrey or in other similar movies of this kind.Yes man basically feels like it was put together by committee with little thought put into it. A very run-of-the-mill effort. The one joke premise leads to a mediocre execution.Yes man made me laugh very little. I've seen comedies that were far better than this one. I had trouble staying awake while watching. It bored me most of the way through.Although, I'm a Jim Carrey fan his is not his best outing and far from his funniest comedy. He's done better in the past.",5,2,4,27 May 2009
Yesterday," A pleasant surprise. Exceeded my expressions.
","I saw this delightful, clever and funny film. I thought it was magnificent. Wonderful cast, great screenplay and a soundtrack filled with fantastic Beatles music. An extremely charming movie, I was captivated all the way throughout the film. Another great Danny Boyle film. It was pleasure to watch.",8,0,3,30 June 2019
Quantum of Solace," Not as good as Casino Royale. Should have been a lot better.
","The latest James Bond film is essentially attempting to mimic a Jason Bourne film in this sequel to the excellent and exciting Casino Royale which was created with the intention of rebooting the franchise. The Bond movie producers seem to have acknowledged the stunning success of the Bourne spy franchise. The makers of the latest James Bond film are evidently trying to capitalize by crafting Quantum of Solace to look and act kind of like a Bourne film. Some aspects of the Bourne films have been copied and imitated to a certain degree.Action definitely takes precedence and priory over plot made obvious by the thin story. One of the problems with Quantum of Solace is that it focuses too little on plot, paying more attention to action that's very much in the vein of the Bourne films, brutal and intense. There's a lot of super-fast cutting, frenetic editing, dizzying motion camera shots that could give someone motion sickness and quick paced disorienting action sequences. All similar traits lifted from the direction of the Bourne films. It's very hard sometimes to keep up with what's transpiring during the fight and chase scenes because everything is happening rapidly at lightning speed. The movie doesn't give the audience a lot of time to follow what's going on. Quantum of Solace picks up shortly after where Casino Royale left off.Most Bond cliché's from previous films are done away with. No Q, Moneypenny, gadgets etc. The movie seemed kind of shallow and lacked depth. Sort of a minor Bond outing that's mindlessly fun to watch, but pretty much forgettable and doesn't really stand out. Daniel Craig as a brooding, vengeful and conflicted is very good. He made an alright Bond film better. I like his portrayal of Bond even though I wouldn't call it as much of a revelatory take on the character, unlike in Casino Royale.The plot isn't as important or integral to watching the movie this time around. It has to do with the same SPECTRE-like shady international criminal organization introduced in Casino Royale attempting to take control of a certain natural resource from Bolivia through manipulation and deception. Emotionally affecting and poignant moments that helped build Daniel Craig's James Bond and other individual characters in Casino Royale are almost non-existent. The movie is all about impressing and wowing the audience with elaborate action scenes (There's one in progress as soon as the movie opens), bond girls, homages to past bond films and dry Bond one liners.Even though I did like Quantum of Solace, finding it to be enjoyable in a mindless sort of way, for the most part I thought it was nowhere near as great, entertaining or memorable as Casino Royale.",7,1,1,15 November 2008
Once Upon a Time in America," An impressive achievement and a work of cinematic genius
","Serves as a perfect example of how adept and proficient Sergio Leone was as a director. I thought this movie would be more like a sweeping epic gangster movie similar to The Godfather. In a way it is, but more often than not it isn't. The two movies frequently contrast and differ with each other. I'm not sure if it's even fair to compare the two because the two films are aiming to accomplish different agendas and both follow distinct paths. The ambiguity and various forms of symbolism presented throughout the film will likely leave people scratching their heads in a state of confusion. I don't think Leone ever meant the film to be cut and dry in any obvious way. He really wanted the viewer to come to their own conclusions as to what has taken place by the conclusion of the film. Leone wanted the audience to think deeply about it. This is truly a thought provoking. Once Upon a Time in America is intelligent, has an intricate narrative, a multiple-layered plot and is profound. The movie is without a doubt an impressive achievement and a work of cinematic genius.",10,2,5,21 November 2009
Taken," Taken is an exciting, although too predictable
","Taken contains very little plot, gets kind of ridiculous at times and is quite predictable. It's also a fun, fast-paced revenge movie with lots of good kinetic action sequences and unfolds at a brisk pace. Taken rarely drags and is never really boring. It's an exhilarating non-stop roller coaster ride of a movie that never lets up.Taken has a European sensibility like other Luc Besson produced films have had in the past. It's basically a well shot glorified B-film that is skillfully directed. The movie should be appreciated this way and definitely should seen as serious.Liam Neeson adds much needed credibility to a film that a lesser actor couldn't bring.",7,1,1,24 May 2009
The King," Surprised at how good it is
","The King was a pleasant surprise. Great acting by TimothÃ©e Chalamet. An interesting story about how someone with no direction in life, who never wanted to be king, becomes King. The big battle scene reminded me of Braveheart. Robert Pattinson is memorable too in his small role.",8,6,11,4 November 2019
Slumdog Millionaire," An entertaining film. A crowd pleaser.
","A lively, vibrant and visually stunning production from director Danny Boyle who has demonstrated great diversity in the projects he has chosen. Dynamic camera-work is on display. Both style and substance permeate this enthralling movie. An energetic vibe flows throughout the film. Despite the physical hardship and mental strain that the main characters go through, the movie is always interesting. Truly moving and heartbreaking at times. Dynamic camera-work is on display. Both style and substance permeate a captivating movie. An energetic vibe flows throughout the film. Despite the physical hardship and mental strain that the main characters go through the movie is always entertaining and interesting. Truly moving and heartbreaking at times.The movie successfully held my attention. I wanted to know how everything was going to end up as I watched Slumdog Millionaire play out. With great anticipation I waited to see what was going to happen to the characters that I was following and had invested time in. The conclusion of the movie works as well. Even though the main character goes through plenty of hardship and sorrow I would still call the movie a crowd pleaser.Slumdog Millionaire is written commendably, admirably produced, notably acted and highly entertaining. A lot of people who see it will be impressed and affected emotionally.",8,1,3,6 December 2008
Law Abiding Citizen," An enjoyable thriller that's worth watching
","Ridiculous, silly, over the top, riddled with plot holes and loaded with impossible scenarios that could never happen in reality. Funny enough, this is actually what made the movie watchable. It's so over the top in every way that it left me wanting to see more. Every step of the way I kept trying to guess what was going to happen next. I ended up liking this movie more than I expected to. Sure it has its problems, but I was never bored by it. I don't really care if it didn't make a whole lot of sense. This movie was entertaining and better than I thought it would be. Though not a 'masterpiece of cinema' in any way it was however an enjoyable thriller and a decent way to waste time.",7,0,0,22 February 2010
