The Monuments Men," Disappointing
","Just to Get one thing straight, i don't dislike this movie. In my Opinion it's entertaining in his own way. But i'm still disappointed by this movie, the Trailer really got me interested and i was really looking forward to see this movie. But i was probably expecting too much. The Story about a group of People, trying to Return some of the most important Pieces of Art in European History, to there rightful Owners is great. It's Characters Motivations are believable, those people weren't just some Art-Crazy Nutjobs that risked their lives to Save some Paintings they've only saw in Books, it goes deeper. I give this Movie Credit for not being an over-the-top patriotic WW II Flick. It's big Problem is, that it can't decide which kind of movie it's trying to be. Is it supposed to be a serious Drama or a Comedy with some serious Moments. And if you cast a Actor like Bill Murray, i would've expected a Comedy. So we get a mix of Dramatic Scenes, a few funny Scenes and unfunny Scenes which were supposed to be funny. On top of that, this movie is not good edited. Early in the Film the Group splits into several Groups, so the movie keeps switching between these Groups, which makes it sometimes hard to follow the Plot. Sometimes the time Gap between the cuts are crazy. In one scene we are in France during Autumn, then they cut and next they show us a scene in deepest Winter during the Battle of the Bulge. For all i can see, the acting is good, but because i watched the German-dubbed Version of this movie i can't fully Judge the acting. Now, is this movie horrible? Well, no it got some weak Moments and some strong Moments. When this movie was was over i thought to myself 'this movie was OK'. But maybe that's the Problem it's just OK.",6,4,6,20 February 2014
Gravity," Entertaining but could've been a lot better
","I wasn't expecting all too much from this Picture to begin with. Therefore i was surprised how entertaining this movie actually is. The Visuals are Stunning and they deserve all Credit they've gotten. The Story is Original, at least i cant remember of a Movie with a Story similar to this. Two Astronauts, alone in the Space without backup or help from mission Control, trying to get back home. The Movie is trying to be extreme Realistic and sometimes it seems to be realistic, but we get way too many 'What-the-fuck-just-happend' Moments. It didn't need to be this way, many of these unrealistic Scenes could be fixed with one or two additional Scenes, but no they let it that way. The most unrealistic scene is at the end of the movie. I disliked the Ending itself.WARNING: SPOILERS BEHIND THIS LINEThere were a Lot of unnecessary Scenes in this movie. For example: in one scene Dr. Stone gets to the ISS, to contact Mission Control and to use one of the Sojus Capsules to get to a Chinese Space Station. But she then finds herself in a immense Fire later. She rushes to the Sojus and gets away. Since the ISS is destroyed by the Space-Garbage shortly after this incident, this was just a pointless action scene. She needed to get to the Sojus anyway. Which brings me to the Ending. She barely makes it to the Chinese Space Station. Only to find out that it is about to enter the Earths Atmosphere and slowly Starts to burn. So instead of undock an re-enter in a save way, she just stays while everything around is getting destroyed. OK I'm not an Engineer or a Physicist, but i still doubt that she would survive a re-entry like it's shown in the movie. In the End Dr. Stone makes it back to the Earth, she stands at some nameless Beach somewhere and we fade to black. The End. Did she got rescued ? Never shown! Did she accidentally land on a lonely Island in the middle of the Ocean? Never explained!OK, maybe i seem to be a little unfair to this movie, but i seriously liked it, with all of it's weird moments. It was Entertaining, it looked stunning and it's finally a new original Sci-Fi Story. I really liked it.",6,0,3,5 March 2014
