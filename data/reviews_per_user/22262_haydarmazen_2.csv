Despicable Me 2," Funny how? Felt disappointed
","This is what often happens with sequels, they disappoint the viewer – this means they are not as interesting as the first movie. This movie is not funny by any level and the character Gru lacks what he brought in the original movie (unpredictable behavior). I actually admired the character in the first movie, and some of that evilness in Gru should have stayed with the Character. This is what the title is based on (despicable me. Any change in the character takes the whole concept out and the movie becomes a repetition of hundreds of movies where the hero is at risk and then get saved at the last minute. The whole plot is stupid and 'déjà vu'. I am just surprised and disappointed with the level of this movie.",5,0,1,9 January 2014
Snatch," One of a kind!!!
","I have seen this movie more than five times! It is an amazing one to watch, it has all the ingredients for a successful movie, the plot is interesting, lots of amazing and unique characters, the accents used in the movie are impressive, and finally what brings it all to good closure is the unpredicted sequence of events. I do not know of many movies that are similar or even come close to the greatness of this movie. You can get many quotes out of this movie and it never gets old or dull. It should be rated as one of the top 10 or 20 movies ever made.I have it and I recommend others to own it!",10,0,3,9 January 2014
