The Lobster," Brilliantly absurd!
","Keeping it simple I'll say it's a legendary movie which shall find its rightful place in my all time favorites!Quite easily the best movie of 2015, the beauty of this movie lies in the sense of simplicity it creates while delivering an absolutely intriguing plot. Excellent performance by Collin Farrell - which I believe is thus far his best. Moreover the plot is so exceedingly brilliant and the ingenuity of the director in bringing out the absolute absurdity of it can be just too much on your senses. It might leave you absolutely spellbound or completely indifferent depending on how refined your own taste is.",9,0,2,26 December 2016
