Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Very Funny, but not for the PC
","This movie was amazingly funny, and exceptionally crude. Despite that, I'd have to say its a Must See. Kazakhstan and the Jewish will not be thrilled at their portrayals, but this movie pokes fun in so many directions at so many 'groups', one just roles with it all. One can't tell which are actors and which are real. Apparently the Frat boys might be real as they are suing for all the stupid things they said as they 'thought' it wouldn't be shown in the USA (drunken idiots). But the most offensive thing about this movies is the fat naked man, out of control! OK, OK, warned y'all about some of crazy stuff, that being what it is, I definitely recommend seeing this jaw dropping, over the top humorous film before some PC 'group' finds away to pull it from the market!",9,2,8,21 November 2006
