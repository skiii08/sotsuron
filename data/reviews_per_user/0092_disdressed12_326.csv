The Rock," fun action packed,thrill ride with some depth to the story
","i loved this movie,mainly because of the spectacular action sequences.this is definitely an action packed pop corn flick.there is also a list of huge names in this one.first,we have Sean Connery,who is usual very good in any movie.then there's Nic Cage,also great as an action hero.Ed Harris also stars,and is impressive.David Morse is also in the cast,and as always is understated yet brilliant.rounding out the cast,we have William Forsythe,and Michael Biehn,two fine but under rated and under used actors.so there's lots of star power in this movie,which is great.and their is also a pretty good story.but what really propels this movie is the action.yes there are some sequences that defy reality,but in this case that didn't bother me.i think mainly because of all the great actors and the fairly strong story(for this genre,anyway).basically,this is a fun, thrilling movie,with a bit of depth.i give 'The Rock' a 9/10",9,3,4,4 June 2007
The Blair Witch Project," truly pathetic
","yeesh.what a dumb movie.not scary,or suspenseful.made for very few dollars,which is quite evident.but that's not necessarily why it sucked.for one,there isn't really sense of evil or malevolence.at least i didn't think so.the camera work is not very good.the so called actors leave a lot to be desired.the picture is grainy and washed out.possibly intentional,for some kind of effect,i suppose.for me,if a movie gives me motion sickness,like this one did,and if you can only look at the screen for brief moments at a time,so as not to be assaulted by a searing migraine,the movie is already in the crapper.i know lots of people raved about this film.but like i said,many people just parrot what they hear others say,even if they themselves hated the movie.and i'm certain many people do the same without having seen the movie.sometimes i swear there's no such thing as independent thought on this planet.so,the movie was made for next to nothing.bfd(big f***ing deal)why should that automatically qualify it as a brilliant achievement.there are some low budget movies that are great movies,but it's not because they are low budget.it's because they have the right elements working together,to craft a good film.this film certainly doesn't deserve 6/10 rating,which is what it currently has.my vote for 'the Blair Witch Project':0/10",1,2,6,2 June 2007
The King's Speech," outstanding
","The King's Speech is a wonderful film full of rich performances from the two leads Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush.both are outstanding in their respective roles.Firth plays.Prince Albert,who in time becomes King George VI,who has a stuttering problem and yet has to address his subjects by radio.he seeks help from a speech therapist named Lionel Logue(Goeffrey Rush)to overcome his affliction.Heleena Bonham Carter is good in a supporting role as well.the film won four Academy Awards and it's easy to see why.it's very compelling and the story is well told.it's well paced,and is never boring.i'd watch it again.for me,The King's Speech is a well deserved 9/10",9,0,2,24 April 2011
Saturday Night Fever," 'You're a clich√©.You're nowhere,on your way to no place' (8.5/10)
","i had never seen this movie before.though i had heard a lot of things about it.anyway,i finally watched it today,and i really liked it.i thought it was very well paced.i liked the dialogue.i thought it was clever.the acting was good,but Travolta was outstanding,but very understated.the dance scenes were really good.Travolta looked like natural on the dance floor.i also really liked the 70's disco music.the movie was written very well,overall.it felt really authentic.the only negative thing i can say about the movie,is that it loses some steam towards the end.but as for the ending itself,i liked it.it wasn't your typical Hollywood ending.i think it was realistic.in my opinion,pretty much anyone can relate to this movie,especially if your just an average person with big dreams.depending on your age,this movie might bring back a lot of memories for you.i think it's still relevant today.for me,Saturday Night Fever is a 8.5/10",9,1,3,15 October 2007
Whip It," the positives outweigh the negatives
","i have mixed feeling on this movie.i was really looking forward to it and had fairly high hopes for it.i don't quite think it lived up to my expectations.however,i liked it more than i didn't,as the positives outweighed the negatives.i'll start with with what i didn't like.the first thing was i thought the movie was too slow at times.and it takes too long too get going.and the whole 'someone lives in small town and hates it and want to get out scenario' is all too familiar.i realize this is necessary to get to know the characters,but for me the least amount of time spent on that familiar scenario without compromising the integrity of the character development-the better in my opinion.once we get to the meat of the story,the whole roller derby aspect,that's when the movie picks up.Ellen Page is good,as is most of the rest of the cast.the only two people i didn't care for were Drew Barrymore and Juliette Lewis.i just didn't buy them in there respective roles.i just think they're both a bit old to be portraying those types of characters convincingly.maybe i'm way off there.on the other hand hand,i thought Kristen Wig was fantastic.anyway,the movie was mostly entertaining.for me,Whip it is a 7/10",7,0,2,30 January 2010
The Avengers," good first movie in the Avengers franchise
","this a movie I quite enjoyed.it hits all the right buttons.intense action sequences-check.funny one liners-check-good acting-check.there wee a number of moments through where the audience cheered and clapped loudly.most of your favourite marvel superheroes are here.there are too many characters to list here.the Hulk(Mark Ruffalo) is one of my favourite characters in this film.he gets some great scenes.there is some fun interplay Between Hulk/Bruce Banner and Iron Man/Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr which I found very funny.the action is off the charts.the acting is really good,as well.one thing I really like about the films in the Marvel Cinematic Univers,there is almost always a scene after the end credits start rolling.for me,The Avengers is a 8/10",8,0,1,19 September 2016
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," not quite as exciting as the original film
","while i found this film to be very good,i didn't think it was quite as good as the original.the film follows the same formula as the original,but takes longer to get going found it a bit slow going-in some parts,and it wasn't quite as exciting.the first film was thrilling from almost start too finish.whereas this film wasn't. get me wrong.there are still some thrilling moments,just not as many as as i had hoped or expected.plus,there were a few absurd moments even in the context of the film.still,it is entertaining and worth watching.this time around,Ed Harris joins the cast as does Helen Mirren who adds some class to the film.for me,National Treasure: Book of Secrets is a 7/10",7,2,2,3 April 2011
Black Swan," i wasn't blown away,but i did enjoy it
","i wasn't blown away by this film,but i did enjoy it.for me,it was well acted,creepy and bizarre. i guess you could classify it a horror/thriller.it might make you cringe in some spots.if you're squeamish,this might not be the best movie for you.but this is also a movie that really makes you think.you never really knew what's real and what's fantasy.Natalie Portman really immerse herself in the role and is very convincing.and the film is never boring.there is always something going on.if you like your movies straight forward with everything laid out neatly,this probably isn't the movie for you.otherwise,i'd say give it shot.for me, The Black Swan is an 8/10",8,0,2,2 February 2011
Scarface," not in my top 250
","wow,what a disappointment.i had high hopes for this movie.i had heard it was great.and it was directed by Brian De Palma with a screenplay by Oliver Stone.not to mention it's rated #161 of the top 250 on this site.so far,so good,right?wrong.for me,this is a decent movie but nothing more.it never really engaged me.i wasn't bored necessarily,but i wasn't overly interested either.the acting did very little for me,except for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio,who i thought was exceptional as Gina Montana.there were some good actors here,but i feel they were wasted. Al Pacino wasn't really impressive.also,this was supposed to be controversial movie,but i have seen a lot worse in terms of both violence and language.anyway,i would certainly not place this movie in my top 250 movies of all time.it doesn't have the impact of the original 1932 version.for me,Scarface is a 6/10",3,1,2,26 June 2010
Frost_Nixon," very good,not spectacular
","while i thought this was very good film about the infamous Frost/Nixon interviews,i don't think it was spectacular.i thought Frank Langella was very good as Nixon,although i have read comments on this site that his accent was horrible.having not yet seen the actual interviews,i can't comment on that.i also thought Micheal Sheen was excellent as Frost.he made me completely forget his character in Underworld I and II.the supporting cast was also very good,with Oliver Platt,Sam Rockwell,Matthew Macfadyen,and Kevin Bacon.however,i was most impressed by Rebecca Hall.as for the movie itself,i found it just this side of riveting.it was interesting,but it didn't have me on the edge of my seat or glued to the screen.still,it is a very good film.for me,Frost/Nixon is an 8/10",8,0,1,11 May 2009
Walk the Line," a stunning biography of johnny cash
","wow!!!i'd heard this was a great film,so i finally decided to watch it.i have to say,it exceeded my expectations.the acting was amazing in this movie,as was the direction.i really liked the fact that it showed cash at his worst,as well as his best.there was a great back story to walk the line,beginning with cash as a twelve year old child,and how he had a less than perfect childhood.his father was a jerk,to put it mildly ,while his mother just stood on the sidelines,allowing young john to be treated poorly.the supporting performances were also very good.but it was joaquin phoenix (as a grown up cash, and reese witherspoon,as june carter who would eventually agree to marry him and become june carter cash),who were both brilliant.there was great chemistry between the two,and you really wanted them to get together.i really liked the interplay between the two.the dialogue was well written.i also loved the old songs,from the 50s and 60's. this film showed cash as a rockabilly type singer,before he became famous for his country songs.he was very popular as a rockabilly singer,much more popular than i think most people realize.he wasn't a perfect person,by any means. he had his problems,but was deep down a good man,and really tried hard to turn his life around.you felt sympathy for him and felt his happiness when june carter finally agreed to marry him.this is one of the best movies i have ever seen.great movie all around.wow!!!i highly recommend it.even if you are not a johnny cash fan,(which i wasn't),you will be entertained. as an aside apparently both phoenix and witherspoon did all the singing themselves,making their performances even more amazing. 10*",10,0,1,16 October 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," wildly funny first half. after that---not so much
","this movie is hysterically funny,at least the first half is.the problem is,after that it just gets silly and old and pointless.to me,this is one example of a TV show character which doesn't quite make it in a full length feature.some of the things Borat does are done merely for shock value,but come across as being inane at best.there's only so much of the same thing you can take over and over again.some of it is undoubtedly in poor taste,but that's not the problem here.the problem here is trying to do too much with too little.i nearly peed my pants several times in the first half,but after that,nary a trickle.so,fora riotously funny first half,i give 'Borat' 6/10",6,1,3,19 May 2007
Alien 3," the weakest of the series(but still a very good movie)
","Alien 3, while still a very good movie,does not quite meet the standard of Alien and Aliens.there are some good things about this movie.one is the setting.the movie takes place on Fiorina 161 ,a remote prison planet which is host to all male convicts...until Ripley arrives.obviously there is tension right from the start.Ripley must contend with men who have not seen woman in a long time.Naturally,although unknown at first, an alien has also arrived with Ripley.this movie is very action oriented,not a lot of suspense,and lots of blood for this series.the alien has evolved,both the look of it,and also its characteristics and capabilities.there is also another danger to contend with,something unexpected(or maybe expected.)Anyway,this movie is more of an action,gore film,which is much lighter in tone than the 1st 2 films.the feeling of imminent danger or peril is lacking here.there is very little buildup to the killing.so,while still an entertaining movie,it doesn't quite reach the lofty heights it could have. 7/10",7,4,6,2 February 2007
Gremlins," great horror/comedy blend
","i liked 'Gremlins' a lot.i thought it was well acted and funny.it also had some black humour,which i liked.i liked the look of the gremlins.they would probably be scary for some children.they are quite freaky looking.i thought the puppetry was amazing.for the most part it really looked like these creatures were doing what the movie showed them doing.the gremlins were hysterical at times in what they said and how they acted.this is my idea of a good horror/comedy.it balances both elements well.it think the potential was there for the movie to be really awful,but good writing makes all the difference.the only real complaint i have about the movie,is you could really tell it was all a set,which looked suspiciously like many movie sets of the time.i'm sure they used that particular set for several movies.anyway,this is just a small complaint.and i'm probably being petty.otherwise,i really enjoyed the movie.for me,'Gremlins' is an 8/10.",8,1,3,20 April 2007
The Incredible Hulk," a much different beast than Ang lee's 2003 version
","i liked the first live action hulk movie from 2003 somewhat,but this is an entirely different beast.for one thing,the story is much stronger and better developed.Edward Norton is fantastic as Bruce Banner,the hulk's alter ego.Liv Tyler is also strong as Betty Ross,Bruce's love interest.Tim Roth is also pretty good as a gung ho soldier recruited by General Thaddeus 'thunderbolt'Ross(William Hurt)to try and capture Banner/the hulk in hopes of finding a way to use Banner's affliction as a military weapon.in my mind Hurt gives the strongest performance in the movie.the action sequences are breath taking,and the hulk itself is much more gargantuan than in the 2003 version,although i think he actually looks a bit more cartoonish.the movie also pays tribute to the 1970's TV show at times,both in dialogue and in action.all in all, i had one heck of a good time here.for me,The Incredible Hulk is an 8/10",8,2,3,18 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Keri Russel,Laurence Fishburne,Philip Seymour Hoffman....
","the three main reasons this 'Mission Impossible' entry is the best yet.yeah,Tom Cruise is back,of course,and does a good job as the main character Ethan Hunt.however,it is the presence of the three actors mentioned in my summary which make this movie succeed.first,Laurence Fishburne,a physically imposing presence for sure,but also extremely charismatic with a very palpably intense screen presence.i think he owns any scene he is in.next,Philip Seymour Hoffman,also a very strong screen presence who manges to be both understated and mesmerizing at the same time.and Keri Russel,(from the dramatic TV series 'Felicity'very impressive here in an action movie.she impressed me the most in this movie.there is just something about her,something intangible you can't put your finger on.the rest of the supporting cast are also strong.also,this third installment in the series is not convoluted,like the first,and not as reality defying as the second.don't get me wrong,there are some stunts that are not too realistic,but to a lesser degree and not as frequent.i also think the story is better and the villain is very strong.this would be the ideal end to the franchise,since it goes out on a high note.but time will tell.the last three or four 'Bond' films(excluding the last one) were much more unrealistic.i highly recommend Mi:III.an easy 8/10",8,0,0,2 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," the first prequel to the original trilogy(chapter 1)
","'The Phantom Menace was the most hyped movie since 'Gone with the Wind'(1939)to say it was eagerly anticipated is an understatement.after all,this was the movie which set the stage for the eventually genesis of Darth Vader.You see,George Lucas's original Trilogy began with episode 3,followed by 4 and 5.this was the first prequel,chapter 1.was it worth waiting for?it really depends on your perspective.as far as story goes,it is fairly weak.but visually it is very appealing.it is very well photographed.again we have an abundance of action.there is a very cool minor villain,whose character should have been developed more.let's not forget Jar Jar Binks,a character too juvenile for this movie.and,i swear he is a stereotype of black people.close to racist,in my opinion.and we get to see young Anakin Skywalker,as a 5 year old boy,who eventually will become Darth Vader.i enjoyed this movie quite a bit,though it is nowhere near the standard of the original trilogy.the one question i have is--who comes up with these titles.I mean,'The Phantom menace',come on.anyway,i think this movie deserves a 6/10",6,0,3,22 February 2007
The Finest Hours," exciting stuff
","I liked this film.it's set in New England1952during a massive storm at sea,which crucially damages as on oil tanker off the sea of Cae Cod.a daring Coast Guard rescue operation(with four coastguard members) is undertaken to rescue the crew of the tanker and get them home safely.this is Disney film,so sometimes the music gets a little melodramatic for my taste.but this didn't effect my enjoyment of the film.this being set in the 1950's,the women in the film are mostly relegated to the sideline.the one exception is the character of Miriam(Holliday Grainger(love interest for Chris Pine's character Bernie Webber))who is a strong female presence,but is sadly underused.also,the one black man on the doomed tanker gets one sentence the whole movie.if you can overlook these issues,you should enjoy this film.it's fast paced,thrilling and well acted.for me The Finest Hours is an 8/10",8,1,1,3 October 2016
Ali," a career performance by Will Smith(too bad the movie is sub standard)
","this film about Muhammad Ali is a disappointing effort.it's over long,boring at times and lacking much intensity.the movie is all flash and no substance.Will Smith though is very brilliant in the title role.he inhabits Ali's body and soul.the problem is,the movie is not worthy of his huge talent.it does have its moments,but really it has an empty incomplete feel to it.after it was over,i was left unsatisfied.this movie should have been great,but there's something missing.though Smith exudes heart,soul and intensity ,the movie has neither.i had such high hopes for this one.the irony of it all,is this may well be Smith's greatest performance so far,that i have witnessed.he really put on an acting clinic.even though the movie fails to impress,i recommend for those that want to see what real acting is.as a result,i give 'Ali' 6/10",6,1,3,25 May 2007
Catch Me If You Can," terrifically entertaining lite hearted fare from Steven Spielberg
","Steven Spielberg directed this light hearted 'based on a true story' crime drama.it's basically about one young man who assumes several different identities while forging millions of dollars worth of checks without the FBI being aware of it.along the way,he poses an a doctor,lawyer and a commercial pilot.once the FBI does catch on to him he manges to stay at least one step ahead of them.this movie takes place in the 60's and in this day and age,a Frank Abagnale would not likely have been successful in forging checks and/or eluding the authorities.Leonardo DiCaprio plays the lead role of Frank Abagnale.leading the FBI investigation is Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks.it's fun to see the two try to outwit each other,and there are some close calls for Frank,in which he is moments from being discovered.just like in The Terminal,Steven Spielberg shows he is just as skilled with the lighter fare as with the darker subjects he is known for.",9,1,3,22 January 2008
Marie Antoinette," witty and stylish
","for a period movie,i felt this was more lite hearted than most.i found it witty,even funny at times.it movies along at a good pace,and is never boring.the movie is also virtually very nice to look at.even though the overall tone of the film is fairly lite,it does treat the more serious issues with the darker tone the deserve.much of the music for the movie is contemporary,which might not work for some people,but i didn't mind it.at first,i didn't care for much of the acting,but the performances grew on me quickly.Kirtsen Dunst shines in the title role.Jason Schwartzman is also good.in a what seems a strange casting choice,Rip Torn also appears in the movie.but Torn makes his character work.though i thought this movie was exceedingly entertaining,i wish the ending had been different.it just didn't work for me.many people may not liker the fact that the movie is done in a lite hearted way,but that didn't bother me here.if it wasn't for the ending,i would have given this movie a higher vote.but as it stands,i give Mare Antoinette an 8/10",8,0,1,12 January 2008
The Ring," underwhelming
","i may be in the minority here,but i just didn't find the Ring to be a good movie.for me,it's not much different the the Grudge.i will say,i liked it a bit more than The Grudge,only because it isn't so annoying.there are a few differences between the two movies,but in my mind,it's almost the same movie.i do remember being bored and struggling to not nod off.i just didn't see any excitement anywhere in the movie,but that's just me.Naomi Watts is in it,and she's not bad,considering what she has to work with.but once again,the ghost is not scary,although it does look a bit creepy,i guess,vaguely.i didn't feel any suspense either.but if you liked The Grudge,then you might like The Ring.or you might want to check out The Messengers(which i liked) and Pulse,(2006)(which i liked)which are sort of similar but better in my opinion.as for The Ring,i give it 4/10",4,0,1,16 August 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," brilliant
","wow.this movie is way better than i remembered to be.it's simply brilliant.the story is great,the action is terrific,there's lot of excitement and the film really moves along.even though the story was co-written by George Lucas,the dialogue is surprisingly not bad at all.Harrison Ford is Indian Jones,the main character,an archeology professor and archaeologist.i read once that Tom Selleck was up for the role,but could not get out of his contract with Magnum P.I.thank goodness,because i can't imagine anyone besides Ford in the role.Karen Allen co stars as Indy's former flame.there's also a tiny monkey in the movie,which gets a few laughs.finally,there is the great musical score by the great John Williams.this movie is put simply a blast. 9/10",9,0,0,15 June 2008
Resident Evil: Afterlife," boring and slow
","man what a drag this movie was.i was bored out out of my skull for most of the running time.this is easily the worst of the Resident Evil franchise so far,in my opinion.parts of it reminded me of Ultraviolet,which i hated.it also reminded me of Aeon Flux,which i also didn't like very much.this movie is not that bad,but it isn't very good.there were a couple good things about it.the undead had something that made them a bit more deadly this time around,and there was a really neat undead character introduced.other than that though,i found it slow and boring in general,and compared to the other films in the franchise.for me,Resident Evil: Afterlife is a 4/10",4,0,2,6 May 2011
Casablanca," maybe a bit dated but well worth the watch
","i enjoyed Casablanca,but i wouldn't say it changed my life.it's a pleasant movie,with a good story,good acting,a good locale and an interesting cast of characters.there are some memorable lines,to be sure,but some of them some seem a bit corny.there were one or two eye rolling sentimental lines delivered by Humprey Bogart to Ingred Bergman.but i realize that's probably due to the fact that the movie was made almost 60 years ago.regardless,it's well worth watching,in my opinion.there's no special effects.so it's really all about the characters,the story,and the acting.if those elements aren't successful,then the movie won't work.in this case,they are.for me,Casablanca is a 7/10",7,0,2,21 February 2010
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," not sure who the movie is marketed to
","i didn't think this was a good movie.i can't pinpoint exactly why,but i can tell you i was bored out of my skull.it was much too slow moving,and i didn't find the gags funny at all.i'm guessing children would like this movie,but i think even most teenagers would be bored,but i could be wrong.truthfully i'm not even sure who the movie was marketed to.i mean,there are some funny cartoon moments that kids will probably find hysterical.and yet a lot a lot of the content is very adult oriented,especially a lot of sexual innuendo.however,i think it would be too slow for many adults.visually it's nice to look at,but that is not enough to maintain interest for very long.if you have kids who are preteen or younger,they will like this movie,yet it may not be suitable for them.i certainly wouldn't call this movie family friendly.i would have given it a PG-13 rating,at the very least,maybe even MA for mature audiences(14+.)anyway,parents should really use their discretion with this movie.overall,i think Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a 4/10.",10,0,1,19 October 2006
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," fun for the whole family
","i really enjoyed this animated Disney classic.it's just a lot of fun.lots of action and excitement,and an excellent choice for the villain in Cruella Devil.whose is iconic(or should be)in my opinion.very young children may be a bit frightened of her,as she certainly is scary looking.her 2 henchman are quite inept,and provide a lot of comic relief.i also really liked the voice acting.i thought it fit well with the characters.the animation is also good,considering it is from 1961,though i'm sure it took a few years before that to complete.anyway,in my opinion,this classic is good fun for the whole family.my vote for 101 Dalmatians is an 8/10",8,6,8,10 November 2008
Minority Report," disappointing collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise
","considering this movie is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Cruise,it should be a great movie.but it's not.it's based on a short story by Philip K.Dick.this isn't a horrible movie,but it's just not really good either.i liked the futuristic concept,but the execution of it just doesn't deem to quite work.i found it boring and too long,and not very compelling.Spielberg is a gifted director,and tom Cruise has proved to have a great screen presence,if not great acting ability.but everyone is entitled to a few missteps in their career.this movie is certainly the exception for Spielberg and Cruise seems lacking his usual presence.when it's all said and done,it adds up to a blah experience.i guess it's a bit better than average,so i'' give it a 6/10",6,0,4,26 May 2007
Finding Neverland," truly magical tale of the creation of 'Peter Pan'
","this is the story of J.M.Barrie, and how he was inspired to create the play Peter Pan.the year is 1903 in England.play rite Jmaes Matthew Barrie(johnny Depp) is out of ideas for a new play.he meets a widow with four children nd develops a relationship with the family.in time he uses the family as inspiration for a new play,which he calls Peter Pan.Kate Winslet plays the widow Sylvia.Depp is great,as usual and Winslet is also strong.i believe she is a very underrated actress and i hope Hollywood figures it out soon.anyway,this is a magical fable which both kids and adults will enjoy.i left the theatre feeling very satisfied and impressed.watching this movie will make you forget about your troubles and warm your heart.for me,this movie is brilliant.'Finding Neverland'is a definite 10/10 from me",10,2,2,3 June 2007
Friday Night Lights," best 'based on a true story' sports movie i have seen yet
","this movie was a real surprise.i didn't think it would be good at all.but i gave it a shot,and i actually thought it was pretty good movie.as 'based on a true story' sports movies go,it's probably the best i have seen so far.a lot of that has to do with the depth and heart of the story.it's hard not to get wrapped up in the emotion,and feel what the characters feel.the acting was very good,especially from Billy Bob Thornton.he brought real credible intensity and emotion to the role of head coach.i also felt this movie was more inspirational than others of the genre,but it's not over the top,or in your face.it's much more subtle,but also more powerful.for me Friday Night Lights gets a well deserved 8/10",8,1,4,28 November 2007
Kung Fu Panda," entertaining (6.5/10)
","well,i liked the movie.the story was interesting,and the action scenes were good.the voice acting fit well with the characters.i gotta say though,that,i never laughed once.maybe it's just me,or maybe you have to be in a certain mood.still,i thought it was a good movie.it moves along at a good pace,and it's certainly never boring.it reminded me of the movie Beverly Hills Ninja,starring Chris Farley from 1997.the main character is pretty much the same type of character,except in that one,our hero is a human being,and in this one,of course,he's a panda.the other difference is i actually found Beverly Hills Ninja pretty funny.but that's neither here nor there.as for Kung Fu Panda,i was entertained throughout.i just didn't laugh.for me Kung Fu Panda is a 6.5/10",7,1,2,26 December 2008
Chinatown," I have now seen 2 first rate Polanski films
","Well,i never thought i'd say this,but,i have now seen 2 very good Roman Polanski movies.(the other being the brilliant'The Ninth Gate')anyway,Chinatown is a simple story of private eye Jake Gittes,who stumbles into a murder mystery.Jack Nicholson plays Gittes,in a brilliantly understated performance.Nicholson makes Gittes into a very likable character.The film has a very unique and impressive visual style.Polanski's direction is very tight and economical.everything fits and each scene has relevance to the film.This is not an action movie,but more of character study,and is also very dialogue driven. What action there is,is low key and passive.this is no criticism of the movie,at all.it is so well written that it cannot fail to hold your interest,and as director,Polanski Tties everything up neatly.Faye Dunaway also plays a prominent role in the movie,delivering a very good performance.The only thing i didn't like was the ending.i don't mean to say it was bad ending,i had just hoped it would have gone in a different direction.the screenplay was written by Robert Towne, and Polanski himself had a hand in the screenplay,but is not credited.The screenplay is responsible for a great deal of the film's success,but this is clearly a team effort.All in all,Chinatown is a well crafted movie from all involved. 8.5/10",9,0,1,6 January 2007
Meet the Parents," a sometimes funny,often amusing, generally entertaining movie
","Meet the Parents is not generally funny in a hysterical way(though there are a few of those elements.the movie is more about the funny little things that occur when meeting the parents for the first time.anybody who has ever brought their Boyfriend/girlfriend or possible fianc√© to meet their parents for the first time can attest to this.of course the same goes for the person meeting the parents.this is generally what the movie is about.there are some very funny moments in the movie,to be sure.and there are very amusing moments all through the film. the movie is not funny all the time,but is always entertaining.the movie stars Ben Stiller(The boyfriend),Terri Polo,(the daughter)Robert Deniro(the Father)and Blythe Danner(the Mother)",7,1,2,1 January 2007
Mulan," excellent Disney animated film
","once again we have another excellent animated Disney animated effort. there are some good musical numbers here.many of them quite fun and catchy.there's plenty of humour as well,with some funny and memorable lines and great characters.i especially liked the characters of Mushu,voiced by Eddie Murphy,and Yao,voiced Harvey Fierstein.both were a riot.i also thought the voice acting was spot on.the movie also has a fair amount action and excitement,and is never boring.and it looks really great,to boot.but i think my favourite parts were the comic relief bits.all in, an excellent effort.for me,Disney's Mulan is an 8/10",8,0,0,22 November 2009
Se7en," Enter the mind of a serial killer
","warning:if you choose to watch this movie,know that you will enter on a dark and twisted journey.David Fincher directs this film,which concerns a serial killer who executes people,using the seven deadly sins as justification.though there are some horrific and graphic images here,there real genius of this movie is it's implied horror.this movie will leave you with an impact long after the end credits have rolled.David Fincher directs this intense psychological suspense thriller.Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play two detectives on the trail of the killer.Freeman plays veteran Detective Lt. William Somerset,on the verge of retirement,after this case.Pitt plays rookie detective Detective David Mills.Kevin Spacey also stars in a powerful performance that is mesmerizing.this is one of the best movies of this genre i have seen so far.if you are not affected by this movie,i'd be surprised.for me,Se7en is easily a 10/10",10,1,2,3 June 2007
Star Trek," Boldly goes where all previous Star Trek films only wish they had gone
","on a whim,i decided to see this latest film in the Star Trek Universe.i'm sure glad i did.this is one film that must be seen on the big screen to be fully appreciated.it's an origin story of sorts,a prequel(sort of) to the original Star trek TV series,and obviously all previous films.some things in the mythology have been a bit tweaked,but that's why it works.it's not the old tired formula.there were some good Trek films in the past,a few excellent and a few not so good.but this one blows them all out of the water.not only is the story good,but the acting is stellar.there are also some very funny moments here.and the action is first rate.for me,this is easily the best Star Trek film ever.if you can,i'd recommend seeing it while it's still in the theatre.10+++",10,1,12,4 June 2009
Citizen Kane," i hate to say this but i was underwhelmed by this movie
","OK,i'm certain i'm in the minority here,but whatever.i did not like Citizen Kane.first off,i didn't think it was profound at all.i also didn't think the look of the film was that great.many people say it has a great visual style,but i disagree completely.how this movie is number one all time on some lists is beyond me.to say this movie was a drag is understating things.there was and is too much hype for this movie.so it's directed by and stars Orson Welles.even worse is Welles is widely regarded as a genius as a result.big hairy deal.i was bored out of my skull.considering this movie is considered sacred and any negative comment is blasphemy,i'm glad nobody knows where i live,otherwise i fear i may be hunted down and killed.not too many people are likely to pay attention to this comment,but i don't care.this is how i feel about Citizen Kane.maybe i'm a complete idiot,or maybe i'm just missing something.either way,this movie rates a 3/10 at best.",1,18,33,3 June 2007
The Rookie," great family movie from Disney
","this a great Disney flick.it is the story of an aging high school baseball coach(Dennis Quaid),who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher,but suffered a career ending injury.but through series of events,Jimmy Morris(Quaid)gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the roster.this is a great family film.it is inspirational,but doesn't pour it on too thick.it's fun and entertaining.adults will enjoy this movie as well as kids.it is based upon a true story,though i'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties in telling the story.Quaid is sensational as the title character,very convincing.if you're looking for a film the whole family can enjoy,look no further.9/10",9,1,1,24 February 2007
Memento," a Christopher Nolan gem
","it's hard to comment on this title without giving away major plot points.basically,the gist of it is this,a man has no short term memory due to an assault during which his wife is raped and murdered.he doesn't no who did it or why,but he is driven to find out and bring the perpetrator to justice.but since he has no short term memory he has to use some clever methods just to get through the day,as he tries to piece together what happened.we see events unfold from his point of view.Guy Pierce plays the main character with Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano in strong supporting performances.the time line is a bit hard to follow so you really have to pay attention,and you may have to view the film more than once,but it's well worth it.for me,Memento is a 9/10",9,0,2,12 December 2009
Kickboxer," the movie is pretty good,the songs are crap
","'kickboxer' is one of Jean Claude Van Damme's earlier and better efforts.for a fan of the martial arts,it should satisfy.there aren't a lot of fight scenes,but what there is--is pretty good.there is however, complaint i do have with this movie,and it's not so much the movie itself.it's the sh*t songs in it.once again,we have bad songs by a band that wouldn't rate in the worst fleabag bar.if you can't have decent music(and i use that word very loosely),don't have any music at all.i did like the training montages.i thought they were kind of cool to watch,although they are pretty much the same as in 'Bloodsport', a previous Van Damme Vehicle.i don't think this movie is as good as 'Bloodsport',but it is still entertaining.for me,'Kickboxer is a 7.5/10",8,1,2,20 May 2007
Coraline," not so great
","this is a strange little film.it's probably too frightening for young children.it's a stop motion animation film directed by Henry Selick.i don't want to give any of the plot away.lets just say Coraline(voiced by Dakta Fanning lives mundane,banal life and wishes for something more.i found the movie to be quite creepy at times;it wasn't really a fun experience for me.i found it very twisted and disturbing. for me,there three film in a similar vein to this.James and the Giant Peach,Nightmare before Christmas(Both directed by Henry Selick)and the Corpse Bride,written and directed by Tim Burton.theses three films are much better film in my opinion.for me,Coraline is a 5/10",5,0,0,19 September 2016
Iron Man 2," great stuff
","i had high high expectations for this film,since the first one was so good.i'm happy to say i wasn't disappointed.there is more going on this one that much is certain.Sam Jackson returns as Nick Fury head of Shield in a expanded role.Mickey Rourke plays a baddie(with relish and gusto)Scarlett Johanssen's character is underwritten and underutilized,which is unfortunate,because the character is rife with potential.here's hoping they remedy that situation in the upcoming avengers film.Sam Rockwell has an interesting role.Don Cheadle replaces Terrance Howard as Lt.Colonel James 'Rhodey' Rhodes,and i have to say,i think he is a better fit.and of course Robert and Gwyneth return as Pepper and Tony.and we finally get to know Pepper's actual first name.for me,Iron Man 2 is a 10/10",10,7,12,22 May 2010
Alien: Resurrection," better than Alien3
","Alien Resurrection,while not as good as Alien and Aliens,is better than Alien 3.true,it is fairly light in tone,and not a lot of suspense.however it has a very eclectic group of characters.Ripley is back.there is some humour in this series,much more than the other Alien films.there is lots of action,but less gore than Alien 3.there are also some surprising revelations in this one.it is not as predictable as Alien 3.the aliens have undergone a transformation in this movie,as they have in each film in the series.they have a capability which was not explored in the original 3.there was talk at one time of a fourth sequel,but let's hope they leave the series as is--on a high note. 8/10",8,1,4,2 February 2007
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," i actually liked it ,but not for the reasons i thought i would
","i didn't really like this movie at first,but somewhere along the line it grew on me.it wasn't anywhere near as funny as i hoped or expected,but there were about a half a dozen very funny to mildly amusing moments.i did like the characters,and i thought the story flowed very well,from the halfway point or so.the writing was good,too.i will probably watch it again,and enjoy it more on second viewing.it's a bit raunchy,but i have seen worse.still,if you don't like coarse language,***possible minor spoiler***or full male nudity,this is probably not your movie.Paul Rudd's character ranged from mildly amusing to pretty funny,depending on the scene.Kristen Bell plays the title character ,and Mila Kunis also has a decent sized role in the movie.my advice would be to watch it at least twice,before deciding whether you like it or not,which is what i intend to do.for me,Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a 7/10",7,0,5,10 November 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," less hype,much better movie than the first one
","i must say,i quite enjoyed this movie,i think mostly because my expectations were very low.this is due to the fact that i was disappointed in the first installment,because my expectations were too high.how ironic.this entry had more action,better action sequences and more humour.it was at times also darker than the original and the acting had more depth.there were also more characters and various sub plots,but the movie was still easy to follow.the one thing that irritated me at first was that they made captain Jack Sparrow's character even gayer than the first.Johnny Depp does somehow pull it off,though,give him credit for that.so this was only a temporary annoyance and then the character'quirks,or foibles,if you will,grew on me.i don't perceive being annoyed by this in the next installment.this movie also had some more suspense and the action sequences were at times very intense,in a good way.there was an abundance of cgi in this movie,which was exceptionally well done,the best i have seen in a long time,possibly ever.the filmmakers did a great job of balancing humour suspense,action and some darker material together.the story also had more depth and i cared more for the characters this time around.i think most of the characters were better written,for whatever reason.the only other complaint i have is that the movie was a bit too long.i did however like the ending.nothing fancy,just a low key setup for the third installment.basically,this is a case of the sequel surpassing the original in every way.i can't wait for the third entry,though i have higher hopes and it has a lot to live up to 7.5+*/10",8,0,2,28 October 2006
Rocky V," the weakest of the series(but still watchable)
","i haven't seen the new Rocky movie,Rocky Balboa,so i can't comment on that.but of the first 5 movies,this is the weakest.they should have stopped at 4.the movie is watchable,it's just not up to par with its prequels.it is definitely smaller scale all around.this is obviously deliberate and it certainly sets a different tone for the film.there are some interesting things in this movie.one is who Rocky fights and why.the other is how and where.*mild spoiler ahead*.there is also a sub-plot involving Rocky's son.besides these things,however,it just fails to impress.there really wasn't any need for a 5th movie in the Rocky saga,but they made 1 anyway.so,is this movie worth watching?of course.it is entertaining.just don't expect anything mind blowing. 6/10",6,3,3,2 February 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," victim of too much hype
","what do you get when you have a movie that is over-hyped it can't live up to the expectation?you get pirates of the caribbean.my hopes were through the roof for this one based on all the ads and great reviews.man,what a letdown.this isn't necessarily a bad movie,but it is nowhere near as great as i was led to believe.the acting was okay,and there was some humour,but i think it tried to be funnier than it actually was.there are many films made with very small budgets,including marketing, and many turn out to be fine and sometimes successful films.i guess hollyweird just doesn't get it.then again, i guess i don't get it either since i believed all the hype and went to see this movie.i give it 5* out of 10 based mostly on the acting and some humour",4,4,8,9 October 2006
Star Trek Into Darkness," even better than the first one
","I thought the previous Star Trek film was brilliant.i gave it a 10+++ rating.however,I have to say that I thought this one was even better.the action and tension is ratcheted up a few notches.the acting is of course first rate.the one thing that puts this movie over the top is the choice of villain.the tension builds though for quite awhile before the villain is revealed,which only makes it better when he does appear.this villain is more than a match for Captain James T. Kirk and the Enterprise crew.they must rely on their brains and cleverness to defeat him.all in all,a great,entertaining film.for me,Star Trek Into Darkness is a 10++++/10",10,2,6,19 September 2016
12 Angry Men," an absolute classic
","this drama at it's best.considering most of it take place in one room,you wouldn't think it would be riveting,but it is.the dialogue is superb,and you hang on every word.the story is simple.Twelve jurors,in this case all men,a sign of the times),must decide the fate of one man.his life hangs in the balance.there is a bit more to it than that,but i won't say anymore.there is great ensemble of acting titans of the day here,all a the top of their game.Henry Fonda,Martin Balsam,Lee J.Cobb,Jack Warden,E.G. Marshall,Ed Begley and Jack Klugman are just some of the greats in this picture.for fans of classic cinema,(or for anyone interested in real acting)i would recommend this film.for me,Twelve Angry men is a 10/10",10,0,0,28 June 2009
Hostel," sick and depraved film
","this has to be one of the sickest, most depraved movies i have ever seen.the violence and gore(and there is a lot of it)were absolutely gratuitous and did not serve to further the story.there was no logical reason for this much gore,despite what people might think.usually in a 'horror' movie(at least a good one) there are other elements contained within, such as suspense and atmosphere.this movie has none of that.it seems to revel in its depravity.the characters were much too stupid and i could not muster any concern for any of them.i have seen many horror movies and have a strong stomach,but this was beyond my limits as far as taste goes.i'm not against violence and gore if there is a purpose behind it.of course there will be sequel, which will likely offer more of the same.if all you're into is blood and guts and aren't concerned with little things such as plot, suspense,and sympathetic characters who are more than one dimensional cardboard cutouts, then this movie is for you.otherwise avoid it like the plague.and maybe, if enough people stay away from the sequel,there will be less crap like this produced. the preceding comment refers to the unrated DVD version, not the theatrical version.",1,2,4,28 September 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," truly wonderful movie for kids and adults
","i loved this movie.it has just about everything you want in a movie.there's action,drama,mystery with an air of evil.it also looks great,with a beautiful pallet of colours.kids will like it for its sense of wonderment and magic,as well as its rich collection of larger than life characters.there's also a breath taking battle scene which is quite well done.but this is not just a kids movie.i think many adults will also enjoy it.Tilda Swinton Plays the evil white witch and is mesmerizing.she oozes insincerity,sarcasm and evil,while also holding a seductive charm over both the audience and the characters,especially the children.this is the first movie based on the beloved series of books by C.S.Lewis.as far as i can recall,it stays fairly true to its source material.a warning to parents.this movie might be a bit too intense for young children,due to the battle scene, and the white witch might also be a bit too scary.there are also many mature themes running throughout.for me,this movie is brilliant.i give 'The Chronicles of Narnia:The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe a solid 10/10",10,0,2,30 May 2007
Madagascar," riotously enjoyable animated romp
","for me,this is a ridiculously funny animated adventure.i had a riot while watching.there's some great funny dialogue,some hysterical physical comedy.there is nothing subtle about this movie.they really hit you over the head with the comedy.but in this case,that's a good thing.but beyond comedy,there's also some adventure.the story is also good.the movie is well paced,and has a terrific mix of characters,each with their own quirky traits,who all seem to fit well together.the voice work is very good here.every character's voice fits perfectly.the film is rated G,which is appropriate,although here is some rude humour involved.as far as animated comedy/adventures,this is one of the best.",9,1,2,24 January 2008
The Girl Next Door," disappointing
","boy,what a let down this movie was.i viewed the unrated version,which promised more sex,more skin,more laughs.from what i saw,there was very little skin here,not much sex,either,and zero laughs.Elisha Cuthbert is nice,but she can't make up for how disappointing this movie was.you can tell the movie had some intelligent thought behind it,and wasn't just going for bottom of the barrel comedy.unfortunately,something got lost in the translation for me,as the jokes weren't funny.in fact,i found the movie bland.though this version was unrated,the original version was rated R by the MPAA.in Canada,it was 18A,except for Ontario,which was 14A.i happen to agree withe 14A rating.for me,that's what it should have been rated,including the unrated version.my best advice,if you're a parent,is to pre screen the movie,and decide if you children are mature enough for it.for me,The Girl Next Door is a 5/10",5,0,1,30 December 2008
Ice Age: The Meltdown," sequel set during global warming(thousands of years ago-take that Al Gore!)
","this sequel to Ice Age came out 4 years later,and is a pretty good sequel.i wouldn't say it's as funny as the original,but it does have quite a few laughs.there are a few more characters this time around,which i didn't like at first.i kind of preferred the intimate setting of the 1st,with only 3 main characters.but,once the movie got going,i got over it.instead of an ice age,this one is set during global warming-thousands of years ago,of course(Ha!,i knew global warming wasn't caused by humans)anyway,this movie does tend to be a bit slow at times,but only for brief periods.Ray Ramano,john Leguizamo and Dennis provide their voices again,and are joined by Queen Latifah.this one is rated pg,and it does have some scenes of intense peril that might be too much for young children.there is also some very mild sexual innuendos, but these would be above the heads of any youngsters.as far as sequels go,this one is worth watching.",7,0,0,20 February 2007
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," enjoyed it immensely
","i have not played nor seen the the video game that this movie is apparently based on,so i can't say whether it does it justice or not.however,i can say i enjoyed it immensely.not only is it very exciting and fast paced,but it's also(intentionally)very funny at times Jake Gyllenhaal bulked up a fair amount here and is very convincing as an action hero.Gemma Arterton plays the love interest/sidekick and is also very good.she and Gyllenhaal have good chemistry.Alfred Molina is a scream and steals every scene he is in.Ben Kinsgley is great as well.this movie was way better than i anticipated,plus i saw it a $3 theatre.for me,Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an 8/10",8,6,10,29 July 2010
Balls of Fury," no masterpiece,but has its moments
","this is not a great movie by any means.but it is a movie that takes ping pong(or table tennis)to the next level.the spoof level,that is. as far as i know this is the first spoof that's been made about the game.there are some chuckles here,but no real big laughs.it's sort of like 'Karate Kid' but with Ping Pong.and obviously done with tongue firmly planted in cheek.it's fast paced,and has lots of action.Christopher Walken is the highlight of course,though we have to wait quite awhile to see him.you won't likely be bored while watching this flick.but i wouldn't expect anything resembling comedy of the fast and furious variety.for me,Balls of Fury is a 5/10",5,0,0,31 January 2010
Spider-Man 2," wow!!! is all i can say
","unbelievable.the first spider man movie was awesome,but this movie was even better.better special effects,better story,better villain.i didn't think there was any way the first one could be topped.in this one we have doc ock as the main villain,an inspired choice.the fight scenes this time around are absolutely mind blowing.added to the mix is that peter parker's friend harry Osborne has become spidey's mortal enemy since discovering spidey had a hand in his father's(green goblin) death.there is an interesting and surprising subplot,which i won't reveal here .i gave the the first movie 10/10,so i have to give this one a 10+/10 and i can't wait for the third installment.",10,0,0,23 October 2006
127 Hours," James Franco is brilliant
","127 Hours is the story of Aron Ralston,a mountain climber who decides one day to go on a trek by himself and not tell anyone where he is going.he ends up pinned under a rock in the bottom of a narrow canyon.the rest of the movie is him trying to somehow free himself before he dies as his food and water supplies dry up.there is a particularly gruesome scene in the film that may bother those with a weak stomach.you'll know when it's about to happen,so you'll have chance to look away.James Franco plays Ralston,and is brilliant.the movie succeeds or fails on his performance.the direction by Danny Boyle is good here too.he makes up for the substandard(in my opinion)Slumdog Millionaire.for me,127 Hours is a an 8/10",8,0,3,24 March 2011
Batman Returns," equal to the original,except for one small problem
","to me this sequel to 'Batman' is as good as the first,except for one minor complaint.i'll get into that later.first,the good.this movie improves i think,on the fighting scenes.i think they were a bit more spectacular.i also think the suit looked a bit different,darker maybe,which i liked.Michael Keaton is good again as the the title character/Bruce Wayne.this movie, while generally staying dark like it's predecessor,occasionally takes on a more magical,almost whimsical tone,which is not a bad thing.this time there is more than one villain.first,there's Danny Devito as the Penguin,and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman.Devito is great as the Penguin,clearly relishing his turn as a psychopath.nothing wrong with that performance.but here is the one small complaint i have:the look of the Penguin itself.to me,it just seems like you could tell Devito had padding on to look fatter.this annoyed me a bit.Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman is terrific,a dream to many males out there.she certainly looked good in that leather outfit.there is also a bit more chaos in this one,a few more explosions,but not so much that it becomes ridiculous.if it weren't for how not quite real the Penguin's bulk looked,this movie would rate as high as the first.however,instead of 10/10*,this film still gets a very strong 9/10 from me.",9,1,2,20 July 2007
Blade," a very well executed vampire film
","Blade is the first in the Blade trilogy(Blade,Blade2, Blade:Trinity)It stars Wesley Snipes in the title role as a human vampire hybrid,who has (almost)none of the vampires' weaknesses and all their strengths.Blade has made it his mission to hunt down and destroy the evil vampires.His one weakness is his thirst for human blood.Blade is aided in his quest by Abraham Whistler,Played by Kris Kristofferson,who has developed a serum to curb Blade's blood lust and to keep his vampire side in check.Stephen Dorrf,plays Deacon Frost,the main baddie and Blade's adversary.Snipes is very convincing as an action hero,he is athletic,charismatic,and the camera loves him.Kristofferson is cast well in the supporting role of Whistler.Dorrf is also very convincing as the villain.he too,is very charismatic.Stephen Norrington directed the film.his previous directing experience was 1995's 'Death Machine'.he also directed'The League of Extrordinary Gentleman'(2003).his other credit include special effects work on films such as 'Hardware,Aliens, and the Exorcist:the Beginning,as well as makeup effects for 'Hellraiser:Bloodline'.David S Goyer wrote the script for 'Blade'.he previously wrote the script for The crow:City of angels,as well 'Blade 2' and 'Blade:Trinity'He also wrote the screenplay and story for Batman Begins,as well as the story for its sequel,2008's Dark Knight'.anyway,back to 'Blade'.the film moves along at a brisk pace,is well directed and well written,with good dialogue.the film is also well photographed,is visually very appealing.the tone of the film is dark,without being oppressive and the music is appropriate.there is a lot of graphic vampire violence(the film is quite blood soaked at times)and some language.and obviously there are many action sequences,sometimes over the top,but this is no criticism.it works well with this movie.finally, the special effects are plentiful and generally well done.overall,a very well execute movie in the vampire genre. a strong 8/10",8,0,2,13 January 2007

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," two likable leads overcome lack of originality
","first let me say that there is not too much in the way of originality in this film.however,instead of being targeted to the teen crowd,this one has a more mature demographic,which is refreshing if nothing else.i won't bore you with the details,since i'm sure you can figure it out pretty easy.normally,i'd say this is a typical movie in the rom/com genre.except for one thing.the twp leads (Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey)are very likable.of course,Kate Hudson's always great,in my opinion.there is some great chemistry between her and McConaughey,so you can't help but root for them.the ending of course,is predictable,but it is fun getting there.everything considered,'How to Lose a Guy in 10 days' rates a 7/10 from me.",7,0,0,7 June 2007

Ed Wood," different
","this is an interesting film,sort of a biopic of Edward D. Wood Jr.,or Ed Wood,as he is more famously known.Wood apparently was one of the most inept filmmakers,ever.but he was also passionate about film.he just had trouble raising money,so he had to make his films on the cheap,usually with his friends in the cast.he also had no real idea about how to make a movie.his Plan Nine from Outer Space was at one time considered the worst movie ever made,and Wood became world famous for that reason.unfortunately this was two years after he died.anyway,Johny Depp plays the title character.there are some other well known actors here as well.the movie is at times sad,funny,enlightening,and certainly interesting.i mostly liked it,though i don't think it was a masterpiece.for me,Ed Wood is a 7/10",7,2,2,15 February 2009

","saying there may be something wrong with Esther is understatement.if hell is missing one of its demons,they can call off the search.Esther isn't really a demon,but you get the idea.the main premise of the movie may not be all that original,but this movie puts its own little twist/spin on it that i thought was quite ingenious.there are a few clues that lead you toward it if you really pay attention.and for once,i actually was,and knew there something else going on,and fleetingly had the right idea of what the twist was gonna be,but then abandoned it for some reason.beyond the great twist,though,the rest of the movie is also fantastic.it moves right along,has great suspense,has some very harrowing moments.the acting was great.i love Vera Farmiga in anything she appears in.she takes a back seat here though to young Isabelle Fuhrman,who portrays Esther.if this movie is any indication she has a very bright future ahead of her.overall,one of the better made suspense/horror films i've seen in awhile. 9/10",9,3,6,22 November 2009
Home Alone," classic
","this is a classic movie.i remember seeing bits of it a long time ago,but i don't remember it being so funny.there's lots of slapstick moments where i laughed hard.beyond that,though,it's also a very fast paced movie,but doesn't seem that way while you are watching it.it isn't frenetic or anything,but it's very well paced.it takes place during Christmas,and it has some heartwarming,touching moments.i had a tear or two in my eye.Macaulay Kulkin(at 8 years old or so),steals the show,while Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are also great as 2 hapless burglars,who mess with the wrong kid.it seems Kevin's(Kulkin) family has flown to Paris,but they forgot one thing:Kevin.so he's all alone in his big,expensive house,but far from helpless,when he matches wits with 2 witless thieves who try to rob the house.some of the traps he sets up are ingenious and elaborate.it's not likely most,if any 8 year olds could come up any of the ideas.so,in that respect,it's silly but in a good way.it's all lite hearted fun,but i would give it a mild PG,rather than a G rating,just because there is a bit of very mild language,and a one scene of violence(from a movie).the things that happen to the two thieves are cartoonish violence,very funny.anyway,i really enjoyed this movie and have to give it a 9.5/10",9,1,2,24 November 2008
Terminator Salvation," i was prepared to hate it
","this movie was better than i'd hoped or expected.but it's not really a Terminator movie.it's bleak vision of the future,interspersed with explosions and action sequences.i will admit that they really did a convincing job of showing a future with little to no hope.and the action sequences are not bad,although there's one sequence which belongs in a transformers movie,and was really out of place.it was close to unintentional comedy.and it's the only thing approaching comedy in the movie.there are no humorous moments at all,which drag the movie down.i also found it too long and there were a bit too many loud bombastic moments for my taste.as well there are two scenes which were so obviously on a sound stage,which took me right out of the movie.Christian Bale also seems to be channeling his gravel in the mouth batman persona from The Dark Knight.that was annoying to no end.but despite all this,i still liked the movie.the acting was good,and i liked the story.plus,i was prepared to hate it and didn't.anyway,somehow,the rating that comes to mind is 6/10",6,12,24,24 July 2009
Insomnia," unfortunately 'Sleep Aid' would have been a more apt title(although they tried hard to make this one work)
","i didn't like this movie too much.as a matter of fact,it nearly put me to sleep.how's that for irony.the movie is basically about murder which occurs in a small Alaskan town.two big city cops are sent to investigate.the twist to this movie.the sun doesn't set,which throws everything out of whack for the detectives and complicates their investigation.Robin Willima is in this one,in another darker role for him.Al Pacino,Hilary Swank and Martin Donovan also star.there's nothing wrong with the acting,but the movie is much to methodical,as it slowly plods from one clue(or non clue) to the next.as i said earlier,i had a heck of a time staying awake with this one.Christopher Nolan directed this movie,but he cannot be blamed for this one.the writing is the culprit here.i suspect,it looked good on paper and even while they were filming,but somehow the end product doesn't seem to work.i think they tried really hard with this one,but sometimes things just don't work out the way you planned.this is not a horrible film,but it's just missing something.i give 'Insomnia' 5/10 for the effort.",5,0,1,1 June 2007
L.A. Confidential," An unflinching tale of police corruption and scandal in the 1950's
","L.A Confidential is a great movie.it is very well written and very well directed.it is an unflinching tale of police corruption and scandal in the 1950's.this movie boasts a first rate cast,including Russel Crowe,Kevin Spacey,Danny Devito,Kim Basinger,and James Cromwell,among many others.all give top notch performances,but as usual Kevin Spacey stands out,and Russel Crowe is brilliant,as always.The man is a chameleon,inhabiting every role he plays.i have not seen him give a bad performance.the writing is inspired,with amazing dialogue,and well written situations and characters.the ending is explosive and leaves no loose ends.the film itself is very well paced,with superb editing and is also very stylish.it also has more depth than say,Cop Land,a similar though inferior effort.you can't go wrong with this movie. 10/10",10,1,2,4 November 2006

","...and there's bad news.first,the good news.great villains in The Sandman and Venom.Thomas Haden Church(from 'Wings' fame)is well cast as The Sandman.He makes a credible bad guy,and even brings some sympathy and humanity to the character.Topher Grace is surprisingly good as Venom.also,James Franco returns as the new Goblin.the fight scenes are spectacular and relentless,but there are not enough of them.the CGI is improved from part 2.the scenes of Spiderman swinging on his web and jumping from one building to another are almost seamless.The CGI Sandman is quite good,as is Venom.now, the bad news.none of the villains are given enough screen time,because the filmmakers tried to cram too much story into the movie.the movie enters camp territory at times,which is(or at least,should be)a no no for this franchise.also,the movie focuses too much on the dramatic aspect,the love story,between Peter and MJ.and,there is also a brief musical thrown in. and finally,there was too much sentiment in this movie,compared to the previous 2.hopefully,the filmmakers will get back on track for the 4th installment due in 2009.for a spidey movie,this one is disappointing,but still much better than most movies.for me, Spider-man 3,while not horrible, rate a 7/10,low by this franchises standards.",7,1,2,11 May 2007

His seduction of Nola comes across as real and authentic.Nola,played by Scarlett Johansson is woman who knows the effect she has on men and is more than eager to play the game.However,she lacks self confidence as an aspiring actress and is emotionally vulnerable.Johansson is very credible playing a character more mature than her age would suggest.Emily Mortimer,as Chloe,gives a wonderfully understated performance as the neglected wife who has self confidence issues of her own.as the film moves toward its concluding stages,Chris make his decision,leading to a startling and unexpected conclusion.this movie is very well executed and very entertaining,as well thought provoking.a strong 8/10",8,2,3,21 January 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," better than the first two by leaps and bounds
","i thought this was the best of the Resident Evil franchise.the action was more intense,the fight scenes were away more spectacular and i also really liked the music.obviously,it's not original,bearing many similarities to the first two.and it does borrow heavily from other movies.but still,it is an entertaining romp.i think it is much more gory and graphic than the first two.this is just an observation.it didn't really bother me.this is the first resident Evil movie i have seen on the big screen,and if you have a chance to watch it in the theatre,i think it's worth it.it won't win any awards for deep characterizations or storyline,but it really isn't that kind of movie.it knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else.i think it does what it sets out to do,and that is to entertain.for me,Resident Evil:Extinction is a definite 7/10",7,30,59,22 September 2007
Zodiac," the movie itself is pretty decent,but the disc is bare bones(2 disc special edition comes out in '08)
","i didn't find too many problems with this movie.i mean,it is 157 minutes,but that doesn't really have a negative effect on the film.the acting is good all around,but no standout performances.the story is well written,and easy to follow.by the way,if you're not familiar with the story,Zodiac is a killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 60's early 70's.the case was never officially solved.a lot of the movie consists of quiet,dramatic moments,with a bit of subdued action here and there.the movie is compelling enough to maintain interest,but not outstanding.i did think,however,that the tone of the film was a bit too light for the subject matter.otherwise,though,it's pretty good.the DVD is bare bones,but there is a preview of a special 2 disc edition coming in 2008,which promises insights into the case with in depth interviews from those involved in the original case and much more.i actually think this stuff will be more compelling than the movie.my advice,rent the bare bones edition and wait for the special edition.",7,0,0,3 August 2007
Milk," powerful,thought provoking,and important
","talk about a powerful film.the subject matter is quite controversial,even today:gay rights.the film takes place 30 plus years ago,and illustrates the attitudes people had back then and which some people still do today.Sean Penn plays the title character Harvey Milk.Penn,along with James Franco and Diego Luna put in very strong pivotal performances,and really show just how great they are as actors to portray a gay person as convincingly as they did,and then move on to other projects,and play a totally different character just as convincingly.the rest of the supporting is also very good.if this film, doesn't engage you and get you thinking,i'd be very surprised.it got my blood boiling a couple of times.it is based on a true story,and there is actual footage from that period used in the film.for me,Milk is 9/10",9,1,3,6 July 2010
The Prestige," betrayal,deceit and loss
","i watched both 'The Illusionist' and then this movie 'The Prestige' in my mind both are very good movies.both of them deal with illusion,but the similarity ends there for the most part.they are two very different movies.'The Illusionist'is very low key,almost sublime.the story of 'The Prestige' is more vivid in its presentation.it's on a grander scale,if you will.it has a bigger scope.there are plot twists in both movies,but many more in 'The Prestige'.it almost demands a 2nd viewing to fully understand it.this movie is,at it's core,a movie about betrayal,deceit and loss.there are some well known heavy weights in the movie.all put in very good performances.however,the two people i was most impressed by are Piper Perabo and Scarlett Johansson.i think Piper is very talented and underutilized in the industry.she always has an understated quality in every role.Scarllet impressed me with both her acting and her flawless British accent.i thought it was flawless,anyhow.both actresses hold their own very well.as for the movie itself,i think it is as good as 'The Illusionist' for some of the same reasons and many different reasons.my rating for 'The Prestige' is an 8.5/10",9,1,1,17 March 2007

Cloverfield," didn't work for me
","this is one movie i didn't get.sure,there's some monster attacking New York,and theirs a small group of people which the movie focuses on.it's done documentary style,as one of the characters has a video camera for pretty much the entire time.for me,that didn't really work for me.i also just did not find the movie exciting,or even engaging.plus,it didn't really make sense.it had a lot of hype before hitting theatres,and i'm sure glad i didn't see it in a theatre,because i don't think it lived up to the hype.everything happens so quickly,you never really get a chance to know anyone.the movie is less than 90 minutes,and if it had been longer,it might have made more sense,and there might have been more emotional investment into the characters.oh,well.i'm not gonna say this is a terrible movie,because it isn't.but it's also nothing exciting or interesting.for me,Cloverfield is a 5/10",5,3,5,10 May 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Ichabod Crane vs The headless Horseman
","Sleepy Hollow is a wonderful film.it is very atmospheric, visually stunning and very creepy.Tim Burton does a wonderful job of directing here.this a very well paced film with excellent acting performances from all.the great Johnny Depp plays the role of Ichabod Crane,a very quirky police investigator who,due to his radical theories,is banished to the remote village of Sleepy hollow.Once there it is his job to solve the mysterious murders supposedly perpetrated by the Headless Horseman.the movie is set in the latter half of the 18th century.The supporting cast all put in great performances.This a movie that will disturb you and keep you enraptured by it's beautiful visual style.Sleepy Hollow is also a movie of substance.Burton recreates the time and place very authentically.Though Burton can be hit and miss with his films,he hits the mark with this one. 10/10",10,3,4,6 January 2007

","the 3rd installment of George Lucas's spellbinding space saga had quite big shoes to fill,after 'The Empire Strikes Back'.this would be the last chapter in the original trilogy.off the bat,i have to say that this film is much lighter in tone than Empire.there is lots more action.Good triumphs over evil of course.and the time the evil is much more powerful and the stakes are much higher.there is also some nail biting suspense.there are also some comic elements in this one.i will admit there are few weak spots in this film compared to the other 2,but overall i'd say it is very close in terms of entertainment to its predecessors,slightly surpassing 'A New hope,but not quite as good as 'Empire'.this movie still gets a 10/10",10,0,2,22 February 2007

Blade II," worthy follow up to the original
","'Blade 2' is obviously the sequel to the original.David S Goyer once again wrote the script,based on characters created for Marvel Comics by Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan.Guillermo del Torro takes over the directing reigns from Stephen Norrington.the storyline this time around is more complex than the original.the original had a pretty basic storyline,which is fine for Blade's introduction.now that Blade's character has been somewhat fleshed out,a stronger storyline has to be established.so there is an interesting twist in this film.the stronger story makes the movie more dramatic,so there are less action sequences.the story is slower of course,but it is worth it.a more human sensitive side of blade is revealed.there are still plenty of action scenes,many of which are more spectacular this time around.Wesley Snipes reprises his role of 'Blade',naturally and Snipes really gets to show of his fighting prowess and athleticism in this installment.the direction is as good as the original,though it has its own style.the special effects are improved here,and the tone of the film is darker in generally but there are little touches of mild humour added.the music is again well suited to the movie.overall, a good followup film. a solid 8/10",8,0,2,13 January 2007
Alien," rebirth of the sci-fi/horror genre
","hmmm.here we have another example of classic,iconic movie,which is improved on by its sequel yes,the sequel is better,but that doesn't take away from the brilliance of this film.Alen is obviously a part of pop culture and well it should be.it revitalized the science fiction/horror genre,actually re-wrote the book.1977's Star Wars of course redefined science fiction,but Alien was responsible for the re genesis of the horror/sci-fi combo.although released in 1979,it still stands the test of time,and contains perhaps the most horrific scene in the genre to this day.the suspense factor is still very high to this day.the movie may seem a bit slow at times,but that is to build the suspense.this is not a 'b' movie by any stretch of the imagination,though that might have been the intent at one point.the production values look very high even though the budget was tight.the film has a gritty,dirty feel to it.it looks very authentic.the reveal of the creature was well done.instead of giving too much away,you are shown bits at a time.when the creature is revealed it is something that hadn't been seen before,thanks to the genius of H.R. Geiger,who designed the look of the creature.Ridley Scott,of course,directed the film.if you haven't see Alien yet,you should.just be prepared to be patient,and remember it will be worth it in the end.my only complaint about this film is during the end scene when Ripley is about get into the cryo-stasis chamber.in this scene we see Ripley(Sgourney Weaver)wearing a pair of panties so undersized it is absurd.i'm not sure if this is supposed to be sexy,but it isn't at all.it is laughably ridiculous and sad.i suppose some teenage boys might be turned on by this,but i doubt it.someone really dropped the ball here.anyway,that is the only complaint.other than that,great movie.though like i said,the sequel improves upon it.",9,1,2,2 February 2007

","i really enjoyed this movie.it's the second film directed by Ben Affleck,who also stars in the film.i thought it was well written.the dialogue was very good.the movie flowed very well from one scene to another.there is a fair amount of action which is well done,and there is lots of tension and suspense.the acting is good all around,but i thought Jeremy Renner was really impressive as James Coughlin as was Blake Lively as Krista Coughlin.the Boston accent is pretty thick at times,so you might want to use caption or subtitles so you don't miss anything.there is a fair amount of strong language here,as well as some nudity.and of course being a crime drama,there is some violence,but it's not a violent as you would expect.the extended version clocks in at 150 minutes compared to the theatrical version of 125 minutes.i can't compare the two,as i only viewed the extended cut,but i will say it never found it boring or slow.for me,The Town (extended cut) is an 8/10",8,1,1,3 February 2011

Battleship Potemkin," has to be seen more than once to fully appreciate it
","after viewing this film,i'm amazed at how much the director Sergei Eisenstein was able to get away with.many of the scenes must have been thought of as too brutal for audiences,and also as depicting the army in a negative lite.it depicts a revolution by the sailors on the battleship Potemkin in 1905,which spread beyond the ship to the street.there are some pretty impactful scenes in the movie,particularly during the demonstration in the street..i'm not a history buff,but i think the event actually did take place.this is silent film,so it's not for everyone.this is my 2nd viewing of the movie,the the first was over 10 years ago in a film studies class.i plan on watching it again soon.for me,the movie is well worth watching if you a classic film buff",Null,0,1,13 July 2008
Taxi Driver," one of these days i'm gonna get organiz-ized
","i can't believe i waited this long to finally watch this classic.this is one brilliant film.De Niro is excellent as the title character AKA Travis Bickel.Martin Scorsese directed this masterpiece.i don't wanna to oversell this film,but it's something else.i'm not gonna give any of the plot away,because i think any way who goes into this should view it without any preconceived notions.DE Niro is brilliant here,that much i'll say.i also loved the look of the film,the style,the colours.it's currently #39 on the top 250 here on this site,but i'd probably even rate it higher than that.if you haven't seen it,i would highly recommend it.for me,Taxi Driver is a 10/10",10,1,1,11 April 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," better than the first Captain America film
","this second movie in the Captain America franchise was much better than the First Avenger,at least in my opinion.i thought it had more energy and better action.i also thought the uniform was much better,and I liked the villain more.once again the acting is good.Sam Jackson returns as Nick Fury.Scarlett Johansson is back as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, and Anthony Mackie is good as Sam Wilson/Falcon.i also really liked Cobie Smulders(the TV series How I Met Your Mother,and Avengers) as agent Maria Hill.overall,this was just a better film.but again this is just my opinion.for me,Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an 8/10.",8,2,3,18 September 2016
Tangled," great cg animated film from Disney
","i thought this was a great cg animated film from Disney.it's one of the best animated film i have seen in a long time.the colours are vibrant,the animation is excellent.i liked all the characters.the songs were all good.i liked the story.i thought it was well written.it's also a fast paced movie.kids and adults alike should enjoy this film.it's basically about Rapunzel the girl with the really long golden blond hair.it's rated PG for some brief mild violence,so it might be a bit too much for the really young kids.parents should use their discretion of course.generally,though it's a movie the family can enjoy.for me,Tangled is a 9/10",9,2,5,7 April 2011
We Are Marshall," strong acting,but just a bit too long and a little slow at times
","this is a pretty terrific movie.the acting is great there's tons of action,and there are even a few touches of lite humour.the movie is also very touching,and heartrending,especially near the beginning.it's hard to watch without becoming emotional since the movie is so intense.it's a true story about hope and faith and battling against the odds.but it doesn't hit you over the head with sentimentality,at least i didn't think so.there were probably some dramatic liberties taken to make the story more appealing for the contemporary audience,but i'm sure the gist of the story is accurate and intact.the only minor negative things i can say about this movie is that i felt it was too long and a bit slow at times.it can also be quite depressing,though that's too be expected due to the subject matter.still you prepare yourself for that.otherwise this is a movie well worth watching.i give We Are Marshall a strong 8.5/10",9,0,0,9 January 2008
The Grapes of Wrath," A John Ford classic
","grapes of Wrath is the story of a family who is forced to leave their Oklahoma Farmstead due to the great depression.they leave everything behind,and head for California,where the men hope to work and the family can make a go of things.things don't go as smoothly as they'd hoped,of course.the movie details the struggles they go through.the movie is based on the novel by John Steinbeck(Of Mice and Men)while the screenplay is written by Nunnally Johnson(the Dirty Dozen).John Ford(The Searchers,Cheyenne Autumn)directs.Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad,on of the sons in the family,and the unofficial leader.the acting in this movie is superb from all concerned,and the movie is also well written.it's not an action movie at all,but a story and dialogue driven piece.i didn't find it slow at all,due in large part to John Ford's direction,the great acting and strong writing.it's sad at times,but never depressing.for me,The Grapes of Wrath is a 10/10",10,0,1,26 April 2008
Empire of the Sun," effective and moving
","i really enjoyed this Steven Spielberg film,for a couple of reasons.the acting was one of the reasons.a young Christian Bale(around 12 years old at the time,i believe)is stellar.John Malkovich is excellent as well,as is Miranda Richardson.but Ben Stiller was almost unrecognizable in one of his earliest feature film performances.the story centres mostly on Bales character(Jim Graham)as he struggles to survive daily life in the wake of the Japanese occupation of Shanghai during the second World War.as well as the performances,i liked the look of the film.i think the filmmakers painted a vivid portrait of what daily life would have been life in an internment camp during that time,as well as the effect the physical effects the war would have on the landscape.i thought it was all quite effective and moving.for me,Empire of the Sun is an 8/10",8,0,3,13 July 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," a scathing indictment of the world of fashion(true or not-but probably true)
","this movie is billed as being a comedy drama,but it is more of a black comedy than straight comedy.the movie is very sarcastic and ironic in its portrayal of the fashion industry in general,and the head of a major fashion magazine in particular.Meryl Streep plays Miranda Priestly the head of the major fashion magazine Runway.Anne Hathaway plays Andy Sachs,an eager young woman who dreams of becoming a top journalist and thinks that working as assistant to Miranda Priestly for one year will be her ticket into real journalism.Stanley Tucci plays Nigel a lifer at the company(really nothing more than a glorified worker bee,who thinks much higher of himself) who hopes to one day leave the company and have a venture of his own.Streep Plays Priestly as a scathing,ruthless,ice queen,concerned about nothing and no one but herself and the magazine.she has little time for the peons under her(who of course do all the work and get no credit).she is virtually void of emotion or human feeling of any kind.though there are a few scenes witch show there might be a human being under there.she is also shown,in a few scenes as being vulnerable and insecure,as she has a husband who treats her as she treats those around her.Hathaway's Sachs is a fashion neophyte,as naive as she is eager.time goes on and things change,of course.in time Sachs learns valuable life lessons,naturally.the movie at times is sappy and maudlin and the character of Sachs is played a bit to unreal in the latter stages of the movie.the movie filled with witty,sharp dialogue that flows very smoothly.Streep' performance is subtle and understated but bang on for her character.Tucchi's Nigel provides some dry comic relief and glimpses of humanity.Hathaway fails to make a big impact,and is really just fodder in much of the movie.the character of Miranda Priestly is purportedly based on a real person,although no one can say that of course.either way it offers a scathing indictment of the fashion industry,especially the elite.these people deserve to be skewered,and if they can't take it, they are as thin skinned as those people that work beneath them and are also accused of being thin skinned.How ironic.i hope people in the industry watch this movie and feel uncomfortable, as they should.this movie rates a solid 7/10",7,0,0,19 January 2007
Rocky II," the beginning evolution of an icon
","I actually enjoyed Rocky 2 more than Rocky.while not as iconic as Rocky,i thought this one seemed to flow a bit more smoothly than the first.don't get me wrong,Rocky is a great movie.this is just one of those instances where the sequel outdoes the original(i.e Empire Strikes Back,Superman 2)there is more excitement in this film,the fighting scenes are more intense and the story is a bit stronger.and of course Rocky's character is a bit more developed.the inspirational factor is still here of course.i thought Rocky's motivation is stronger in this one.there aren't too many obvious flaws in the original,and there are not many evident in this film,either.Stallone wrote the script again and pours his hear into both the writing and the character of Rocky.i gave the original Rocky 9/10 only because this one is slightly better(i may be in the minority here) and deserves 10/10",10,1,2,29 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," chapter 2
","Attack of the Clones is a better effort than 'The Phantom Menace'Spoiler ahead***however,the title is a misnomer,meaning the movie has very little to do with the clones attacking.oh well.anyway,in chapter 2 we've moved ahead a few years.Anakin Skywalker is now a teenager,(and we begin to see the dark side emerge in him)and a headstrong pupil of Obi-Wan Kinobi(Ewan McGregor)McGregor should have received an Academy Award for his uncannily bang on portrayal of young Obi-Wan.he had the intonation of Alec Guinness,who would later play Obi-wan as an old man.truly amazing.anyway,back to the it does advance the movie a little bit.tons of action.as a matter of fact too much,too many things going on to keep track of.also some fairly big leaps in logic,and some suspect acting.still and all,better than 'Phantom' 7/10",7,0,1,22 February 2007
Corpse Bride," pretty well done stop motion animation film from Tim Burton
","for the most part,i liked this stop motion animation film,directed and produced by Tim Burton.he also produced The Nightmare Before Chtistmas and James and the Giant peach.anyway,back to Corpse Bride.i thought it was very stylish and nice to look at.i liked the mix of oddball characters with their quirks.i found the movie comical at times,and also very haunting. the story was interesting and engaging,in my opinion.i really liked the voices for the characters.they really went well together.the filmmakers really picked the right actors for this movie.anyway.what i didn't like as much were the musical numbers.i felt they were overdone and a bit repetitive.the also went on a bit too long.and i thought they also stopped the flow and momentum of the film.there were also a few moments were i thought the film dragged a bit.otherwise,though, enjoyed it.i wouldn't recommend this movie for any one under the age of ten,as it does have some disturbing and frightening themes.for me,Corpse Bride is an 8/10",8,0,0,28 October 2007
Forrest Gump," overrated maudlin inspirational speech
","many people love this movie,some even calling it a work of art.however,i must respectfully disagree.i found the movie uninspiring,at best,at mostly one long bore.if you like your movies heavy on sap,you will like this movie.this movie at times felt like one long 'i'm okay, your okay,we're all okay'inspirational speech.if i want motivational advice,i'll go see Anthony Robbins or some other guru. all kidding aside other than the film's heavy handedness,there are a few good thing about it.the acting was good,the special effects were decent.the best thing about the movie,however is its 1960's and 70's soundtrack.despite it good points,the movie is not worth recommending. 3/10",3,4,12,8 January 2007
Gone Baby Gone," good movie,but not as good as the trailer made it out to be
","i initially had no interest in seeing this movie.then,one day,i happened to catch a trailer for it.the trailer made the movie look fantastic,so my friend and i watched it on pay per view.i have to say,i'm disappointed.don't get me wrong,this is still a good movie,but i don't feel it's the masterpiece it was mad out to be.for one thing,i found it too formulaic and predictable.there is of course a moral dilemma for one of our characters.stylistically,it reminded me of both The Departed and Mystic River,which isn't a bad thing in this case.it's just an observation.the acting is very good,in this movie,Casey Affleck holds his own against Morgan Freeman,who is brilliant as usual,though his role is not that big.for me,Gone Baby Gone is a 7/10",7,1,3,21 March 2008
"Monsters, Inc."," Monsters, Inc.
","i didn't find Monsters,Inc all that funny,although i did chuckle a few times.i did find it very entertaining though.it's quite fast paced,and it's certainly never boring.i liked the witty banter between the two main characters James P. 'Sulley' Sullivan(voiced by John Goodman)and Mike Wazowski(voiced by Billy Crystal).i loved all the characters,but Randall Boggs(voiced by Steve Buscemi)was probably my favourite. speaking of the voices,there couldn't have been a better cast.every actor/actress fit the voice of their character perfectly.there are a few mildly frightening scenes,but generally,this is a film the whole family can enjoy.for me,Monsters, Inc. is a 7/10",7,0,1,11 April 2011
Ant-Man," for some reason it under performed at the box office,
","but I thought it was a freaking' riot from the get go.there are some hysterically funny moments here many of them courtesy Michael Pe√±a(End of Watch,Gangster Squad,American Hustle,Vacation 2015)who plays Luis is very funny here.the movie didn't do that well at the box office,which surprised me to no end. but I read there will be a sequel in 2018,which hopefully more people will go see.i know I will be there.anyway back to the movie.there's some good talent here.Michael Douglas is great as Hank Pym.Evangeline Lily(the Hurt Locker,real Steel,two of the hobbit movies and the TV series Lost)is great here as is Corey Stoll(TV's House of Cards and the Strain)Bobby Cannavale( the TV series Vinyl)plays Paxton.I also liked Judy Greer(Jurassic World,the animated TV series Archer.and of course Paul Rudd is terrific as the title character.ha makes a good action hero.for me,Ant-Man is an 8.5/10",9,1,4,18 September 2016
Bridget Jones's Diary," not a good movie,by any definition
","this movie is not funny at all,not even mildly amusing.It is one long bore'm at a loss to understand why so many people rave about it.to be fair,it is a comedy drama/romance.it is dramatic alright,melodramatic.this is not a brilliant piece of work.there is romance,but who cares.the story is not compelling at all.as a matter of fact the whole movie is actually really depressing.however,i will say that Renee Zellweger's British accent is spot on.that is certainly no reason to recommend the movie.in fact there is no reason to recommend the movie.someone thought this thing merited sequel,which i would avoid as well.buying the DVD will definitely be money well wasted.but if you need a new coaster or a doorstop,or a Frisbee,then the disc contained in the DVD case could be an option.otherwise keep you money.",2,2,5,17 January 2007
Captain America: The First Avenger," lacks the energy a marvel film should have
","in my opinion this entry in the marvel Cinematic universe is one of the least enjoyable.i didn't think it was very exciting.in fact I found it downright lacklustre.the villain really didn't do anything for me.i also didn't like Captain America's uniform,to me it just looked lame.the acting was good though.Sam Jacksn reprises his role of Nick Fury.Tommy Lee Jones also appears ,and is very good.Chris Evan is of course great as Captian America/Steve Rogers.but the movie itself seem lower energy than a marvel movie should.that's not to say this was an awful film.from it.but it just didn't live up to it's potential.of course this is only my opinion.for me,Captain America: The First Avenger is a 6/10",6,0,0,18 September 2016
The Godfather: Part II," as good as the original
","usually sequels are not as good as the original film,but in this case it's pretty close.this one is about 25 minutes or so longer(about 196 minutes)and it does feel a bit long on occasion.but it's just as engrossing as the original.i think the story has more depth to it.there's much more going on.the movie jumps back in forth in time.minor spoiler ahead***Robert De Niro is brilliant as a young Vito Corleone***end of spoiler.Al Pacino Returns as Michael Corleone.the supporting cast is great,as well.i'd say this film rivals it's predecessor,despite the few moments where it seemed it bit too long,due to the story being better.for me,The Godfather: Part II is a 10/10",10,2,4,10 April 2010
The Bourne Ultimatum," third in the Bourne trilogy the best of the series
","i'm gonna go out on a limb here,and say that this third Film in the Bourne franchise is at least as good as the last Bond Film,Casino Royale it may even be better than some of the older Sean Connery Bonds.this movie left me breathless.there's no time to get bored while watching this film.the action scenes are intense and frenetic.the fight scenes are even better than in the Bourne identity and Bourne Supremacy,and that's saying a lot.this is the fist Bourne movie i have seen on the big screen,and it's worth every penny.if you get a chance to see to go see it in the theatre,you should do so.anyway,Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne,and is even more convincing here than in the previous two,which is also saying a lot.again we also have a strong supporting cast.there isn't as much drama in this one,in fact very little.this movie does strain believability a bit more than the two previous film,but it is escapist entertainment.i think this movie is the best of the Bourne Trilogy,which,again,is saying a lot.for me,The Bourne Ultimatum is a 9/10.",9,0,1,11 August 2007
Predator," Arnie at his best
","Predator is another classic Arnold Schwarzenegger Movie.Basically the movie is about a group of commandos in the jungle of Central America,who fall victim to a alien warrior.but this is no ordinary warrior.this warrior has great strength and advanced weaponry and is able to blend into his surroundings.One by one the commandos are dispatched,until only,Dutch,played by Arnie,is left.this movie is not for the squeamish.there are some very gory scenes,as the soldiers are killed in gruesome ways.again there are some great action sequences,leading to a the ultimate showdown between Dutch and the 'Predator'.there are also some good one liners in the film,as with any Arnie movie.a very entertaining film",8,1,2,5 November 2006
Notting Hill," slightly above average romantic comedy(not one of Hugh Grant's best)
","i didn't like this movie very much.i didn't think it was horrible,but i just found it slow for a romantic comedy.Hugh Grant is in this movie,along with Julia Roberts.i think Hugh Grant is very funny most times.but in this movie,he didn't seem as funny as usual.i watched about 45 minutes before my attention completely wandered,then i stopped the movie.Grant is also in '2 Weeks Notice',a romantic comedy with Sandra Bullock.that movie i really enjoyed.i felt Grant and Bullock had great romantic and comedic chemistry.i didn't feel any chemistry between Grant and Roberts,for whatever reason.i will say that Rhys Ifans had some funny moments as the roommate of Grant's character.overall all though, i'd say this movie is slightly above average(what i saw anyway)but not enough to make me watch the whole movie.thus,my rating for'Notting Hill'is 6/10",6,1,2,25 March 2007
The Aviator," Brilliant depiction of Howard Hughes's early years
","'the Aviator is a brilliant piece of work.Martin Scorcese did a brilliant job directing it.but credit must also go to everyone else on the crew,for the astonishing look of the film.The film is a biopic about the early years of Howard Huges.it clocks in at close to 3 hours,but is so well paced,it is never boring.Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of Hughes,and i have to say he blew me away with his performance,especially in scenes where he begins to deteriorate mentally,up to the point where he is a full blown paranoid schizophrenic.DiCaprio handles these scenes masterfully.The supporting cast is also very good,including Alec Baldwin,Cate Blanchett,Alan Alda,among others.i have no idea how factually accurate the movie is,but that is why it is called a biopic and not a documentary.I'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties to make the film more appealing and relevant to today's audiences.This is all in all,a brilliant effort from all involved. 10+/10",10,2,3,4 November 2006
L√©on: The Professional," painfully slow with stilted dialogue
","this movie was a real drag.i found it dreary and depressing and agonizingly slow.it has a high rating of 8.5 on this site,which boggles my mind.it's about an professional hit man who ends up befriending a young orphan girl and eventually (though reluctantly) begins teaching her is craft.Jean Reno plays Leon,the hot man and Natalie Portman plays Mathilda,his young charge.this is an early performance for Portman,her second in fact.she is certainly a talented actress,and Reno is also a skilled actor.it's not there performances that are the problem.rather,for me,i think it's the stilted dialogue and the overly dramatic script that sinks this movie.i don't think been this depressed about a movie in a long while.i wouldn't recommend it,myself.it's not the worst movie i've ever seen(and i've seen a lot)but it is certainly closer to the bottom than the top.i don't think i can muster more than 2/10 for this one.",2,10,33,2 June 2007
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," a movie set during the Vietnam war blending comedy and drama very well together
","this is a highly entertaining movie,which flows very smoothly and moves at a good clip.it is based(although very loosely,but it works in this case)the exploits of unorthodox Radio Dejay,Adrian Cronoar.The movie stars Robin Williams As Cronaur and is set in Saigon during the Vietnam war.Cronaur brings his own unique blend of humour to the airwaves.nothing is off limits and everyone and everything Cronaur can think of is skewered in some way.Cronaur is wacky, manic and raunchy at times.this,of course upsets the sanitized and safe version of events allowed on the airwaves.naturally the troops in the field get a big boost of moral and they love Cronaur.the the top brass try everything they can to keep him in line with 'the program'(with hilarious results)and to get rid of him.the movie is not just comedy however.it contains some strong scones of drama,and is even touching at times,yet not maudlin or sappy. Williams was born to play this role and is brilliant as Cronaur.the supporting cast all put in great performances,as well.but credit must also go to director Barry Levinson,who keeps the flow of the movie intact.the dramatic scenes are handled very well,and as i said never drift into maudlin territory.and given the movie's sensitive subject matter,Levinson does very well at keeping the movie from crossing the line into bad taste.I really enjoyed this movie.it is well worth spending the 2 hours.a strong 9* out of 10",9,1,1,1 January 2007
The Bourne Identity," first in the Bourne series(8.6/10)
","this is in great movie.it has tons of action,spectacular fight scenes,beautiful locales.it's a very taut,intelligent movie with a very good story.Doug Lyman directs and does a superb job.Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne,and is incredible in the role.the guy can act,that's for sure.Franka Potente plays a pretty big role as well.there is also a great supporting cast.the dramatic moments are done very well and are very compelling.there's lots of suspense and tension,as well as some twists and turns.i liked the characters themselves,as well as each how each actor made their roles their own.as this type of movie (Spy/intigue)goes,this is one of the best of the genre.it should keep you glued to your seat for the 119 minute running time.if you like this movie,you might also want to check out Mr.and Mrs.Smith(and vice versa),also directed by Doug Lyman.for me,The Bourne Identity is an 8.6/10.",9,2,2,11 August 2007
Hot Rod," i don't see the appeal
","maybe it's just me,but while watching this movie,i was reminded of Napoleon Dynamite,which i thought was a depressing bore.while i don't think this movie was as bad,i still didn't really enjoy it.i found it unfunny,and not amusing.i didn't really care about the characters.i didn't get the jokes,and i don't understand the appeal of the movie,but that's just me.if you liked Napoleon Dynamite,you might like Hot Rod.for some reason,the last 20 minutes or so became mildly interesting,though i'm not sure why.Sissy Spacek and Ian McShane are in this movie,and i think their talents deserve better than this.this probably sounds a bit harsh,but the most i can give this movie is a 3/10",3,2,8,13 April 2008
The Matrix Revolutions," the conclusion of the saga
","i found this concluding chapter of The Matrix trilogy much better than the second installment and probably better than the first one.this one was more coherent and made more sense story wise.plus there aren't as many drawn out repetitive,and absurd fight scenes.this movie is actually pretty exciting,particularly during the showdown between Zion and the sentinels.but this movie,like the other two,borrows heavily from other sources,most notably the Alien franchise,and the biblical parallel is once again very strong.there are some logic gaps,and things that don't make sense,but at least the story wasn't as muddled.to me,this was the most satisfying of the trilogy.for me,The Matrix Revolutions is a 7/10",7,1,2,22 February 2008
Man of Steel," i liked it more than Superman Returns
","as far as superhero movies go,this one is fairly decent.but it doesn't compare to most of the Marvel cinematic universe.as a movie in the DC cinematic universe it's not too shabby.it's got good pacing,the action and fight scenes are well choreographed.the story is okay.it is another origin story to a point.but it doesn't get bogged down in that aspect of the film.the acting is good here all around Amy Adams shines(in my opinion)as Lois Lane,Laurence Fishburne makes a good Perry White.Michael Shannon is convincing as General Zod.Russel Crowe Plays Jor-El and Kebvin Costner and Diane Lane play Clark|Kent's adoptive parents.Henry Cavill plays Clark Kent/Kal-El,and he brings some gravitas to the role.while putting his own stamp on the character.for me,this film is better than the previous installment,Superman Returns.for me,Man of Steel is a 7/10.",7,2,3,14 August 2016
28 Weeks Later," nowhere near the standard set by the original
","for me,this sequel to '28 Weeks Later' is quite inferior to the first one.i found it slow and very boring for the most part.there is less action,but when there is action,it is relentless and frenetic.this is a good thing,except there are not enough of these scenes in the movie.on the plus side i thought the infected had a much better look in this one.they really looked more enraged in this one.i did not like however,the emphasis on gore in this one,compared to the first.i don't mind gore,but the first one succeeded without it,so this one should have as well.mind you there isn't a lot of gore compared to other movies.but there was too much for this movie.i also didn't like the ending.it was too abrupt for my taste.there was a 5 year gap between the original and this movie.to me,it wasn't worth the wait.i won't say this movie is horrible.it isn't,it just doesn't measure up to the standard of the original.if their is a third,i hope they do a better job than this one.for me, '28 Weeks Later' is a 5/10",5,2,6,16 July 2007
The Thing," not quite as good as the 1951 version,but still pretty good
","i have to admit,i actually liked the 1951 version of this film better.don't get me wrong,this is still a good film.it has a good deal of suspense.the setting is good,the whole being isolated in a remote location,nobody around for miles scenario.Alien had the same sort of vibe a few years before with the added element of claustrophobia in the mix,and did a better job.The Thing is just a little too slow and drawn out.add a few scenes of chaos and noise for effect,and a creature that just didn't do it for me in terms of how it looked and moved.despite that,i did like the whole mystery element to it.that was well done.and the ending was interesting.you sort of have to draw your conclusions.for me,The Thing is a 7/10",7,0,5,9 January 2010
21," liked it,didn't love it
","while i liked this movie,i didn't love it.it was entertaining,but not really very substantive.plus,while watching,i couldn't help but think i'd had seen the movie before,under a different title and with different actors.the name of said movie still escapes me.to be fair though,when you make a film centered around the subject of gambling,there's isn't too much you can do to distinguish one from another.i will say,though,that i thought Kevin Spacey was brilliant in his performance and Laurence Fishburne was equally good.Spacey and Fishburne owned the movie in their scenes.Kate Bosworth and Jim Sturgess were also in the movie,but were overshadowed by Spacey&&&possible minor spoiler***Spacey and Fishburne are hardly really in the movie and i don't think he and i don't think they had any scenes together****.i was mildly entertained,and never bored,but nothing beyond that.for me,21 is a 6/10",6,1,2,23 October 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," retread (2006 version)improves very slightly on original(1977);still crap
","the remake of the hills have eyes improves moderately on the original.there are fewer filler scenes,and the movie has a more clear direction.there are less drawn out, tedious sequences.things actually happen for more of purpose.no repetitive scenes of characters running around aimlessly,screening at the top of their lungs, just to fill the running time.not much suspense to speak of,but at least some action. the characters are none too bright, to be polite, so they all deserve to die.the lunatics are not scary in any way, and in fact are quite repulsive and stomach churning and not in a good way.there is of course more gore than the original,for no reason other than to show gore.pointless.the music at least is at least a very slight improvement,not grating and pointless, like the original.there is nothing new or original in this movie.really,there is not much more to say.very moderate improvement,still crap and still not worth watching.1.5&1/2* as opposed to 1.5* for the original",2,4,12,7 October 2006
Cold Mountain," Cold Mountain
","it's been awhile since i've seen Cold Mountain,bit i do knew that i enjoyed it immensely.though it does take place during the the last days of American civil War,it's not really a war movie.it's more of a romance/drama.and it works.mainly because of the performances.usually i don't like Nicole Kidman,but i liked here.i thought she was very convincing in her role.i liked Rene Zelwegger,as well,who i'm not usually a fan of.Jude Law is good as usual.the supporting cast.there are some great supporting performances her,too numerous too mention.there's also some breathtaking scenery in the film.and there are also a number of very nice musical pieces as well.the story is sad and tinged with tragedy but it s a beautifully done well told story.for me,Cold Mountain is an 8/10",8,1,3,12 December 2009

","if this movie isn't as good as terminator 2,it's darn close.it's definitely a worthy sequel.and as much as i liked the first Terminator movie,i think this is a much better movie.it has pretty much everything.it's part comedy,part action adventure,part drama.and all those elements work here.of course it helps if you have good actors,which this one does.Nick Stahl and Claire Danes play the two romantic leads,and both are quite credible in their roles.of course,Arnie Returns,and is great as usual,especially with his deadpan delivery of the funny lines,which there are quite a few.but to me,the best Part about this movie was Kristanna Loken,who played the T-X ,or the Terminatrix,the villainess of the piece.i think she nailed the part of the cold calculating,unstoppable killing machine.she brings a great intensity to the character.this female Terminator is virtually indestructible,which leads me to the action/fight sequences between her and the good terminator.these scenes are intense and relentlessly exhilarating.at least i thought so,any way.the more i think about it,the more i believe that it's too close for me to call whether this movie or part 2 is the better movie.maybe i'm crazy,but i have to give terminator 3:Rise of the Machines a 10/10.",10,1,4,24 November 2007
The Orphanage," quite suspenseful,if very bleak
","i thought this was a very good suspense movie.there were a number of creepy moments,and thankfully no cheap scares.i also liked the fact that unlike in many of types of films,there are no gimmicky CGI ghosts that look ridiculous.the acting is very good too,especially from the woman who plays the mother.i did think it was bit long though,at 105 minutes.i think they could have stream lined it a bit and knocked off a few minutes.the movie is also quite bleak,a bit too much,except for the very last scene.and as for the ending,i' found it a bit confusing,but maybe it's just me,me,because after checking the boards i noticed many people seemed to have the ending figured out.anyway i'll have to watch it again to see if i can figure out what i missed.overall,i'd give The Orphanage a 7/10",7,0,2,22 November 2009
U-571," wow.outstanding!!!nerve shredding tension!!!
","OK,first things 1st.this movie is almost certainly not completely accurate historically,so if that's what you expect,you'll be disappointed.but if you can put that aside,you should love this movie.anyway,on with the show.this movie takes place during the 2nd World War.it focuses on a small group of Americans and a very important mission,one that would eventually turn the tide of the War.virtually all the action takes place at sea,and i gotta say,the tension in this thing nearly wrecked me.there were times i couldn't breathe and other times i thought i was=as gonna explode.if you like nail-biting down to the millisecond suspense,i can't see how you wouldn't love this one.there's not a lot of room for character development,but that's a good thing in this case.in fact,it may have ruined the movie.it's so well directed,i still can't believe.as a matter of fact as i'm writing this,my nerves are still shredded.this brilliant film was directed by Jonathon Mostow,who also wrote the story and the screenplay.He also directed and wrote both the story and screenplay for 'Breakdown' another really good film,but nothing compared to this.anyway,i could go on forever,but for sheer tension and suspense,this is hands down,the best movie of its type i have seen,and i have sen some great ones.'U-571' is off the charts for this rating system,so i'll give it 10+++/10",10,2,11,10 June 2007
The Shining," just watch it
","i don't know if i can meet the required 10 lines of text for this movie,but i'll give it a shot.i had heard great things about this movie over the years,but i thought people were just exaggerating its greatness.imagine my shock when i finally do end up watching.turns out,the greatness of this movie is not at all exaggerated.this may be the greatest,most complete horror film i have ever seen.by complete,i mean it has everything a good horror movie should have.i'm not talking about your typical hack and and slash gore fest.i'm talking about pure psychological terror.the suspense in this movie starts from the get go,and doesn't let up.i gets pretty unbearable.plus,there are some pretty terrifying images.and the acting,don't get me started on the acting.it is simply brilliant.i'm not really a big Jack Nicholson fan,but he leaves nothing on the table here.Shelley Duvall is also excellent,and the kid who plays there son,fantastic.the supporting cast are also very good.when you add a fantastically eerie and terrifying soundtrack,there's nothing else needed.id' pit this one right up there with the original The Omen(1976)for sheer terror.the only downside to this movie is that for some reason,it was only filmed in full frame.if there's ever a movie that cries out for a widescreen presentation,this is it.well,waddaya know,i guess i did meet the 10 lines of required text. 10/10",10,1,2,17 January 2008
BASEketball," starring the two guys who created The South Park animated series
","considering this film stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone(the creators of the long running animated series south Park it's surprisingly not as crude or disgusting as you might think.Maybe David Zucker(director and co-writer) reined them in a bit anyway,Parker and Stone play two lifelong slacker friends who come up a new game combining elements of Baseball and basketball.i found it entertaining and funny. it isn't a masterpiece,nor does it pretend to be.for what it is,(a silly comedy)it works well.the main goal with this movie is to make the audience laugh.and in that regard,(for me anyway)it achieves its objective.for me,BASEketball is a 6.5/10.",7,0,1,14 September 2016
Over the Hedge," average animated movie,below average animated comedy
","i'm a bit surprised at the fairly high rating this movie has(just over 7/10)the film was hyped so much and heaped with praise.even a good friend of mine told me it was hilarious.imagine my surprise in finding out it is not hilarious at all,barely even comical.there are a couple of 'light chuckle' moments,but that's it.i know it is an animated movie and maybe i'm being too sensitive here(or,maybe i'm just out to lunch),but i actually think the movie is mean spirited in some parts. as an animated movie goes it is about average,certainly nothing more.as an animated comedy,it is lower than average.so,i'll give 'Over the Hedge' 4/10",4,0,3,17 February 2007
Wanted," logic?what's that?
","if you go into this movie,expecting logic and/or realism,you will be disappointed.it has almost neither of those elements.nor is it original.what it is,however,is wall to wall action,with death defying stunts and explosions galore.the acting is adequate,though it doesn't really mater here,as it(and everything else)takes a back seat to the spectacle.however,i will say that the casting of Morgan Freeman was a very inspired choice.you get to see him in a role quite different than usual for him,and you get to hear him say words you wouldn't normally hear from him.James McAvoy plays the hero,and does a flawless Shia Labeouf impression.Angelina Jolie plays a prominent role,and Terrence Stamp has what is pretty much a cameo appearance.as for the movie itself,it is intense,loud,and frenetic and there is one plot twist i didn't see coming,though most people probably will.anyway, found it to be a fun waste of time,thought not really memorable.8/10",8,0,2,4 August 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 'I know now why you cry,but it's something i cannot do'
","as good as the first terminator movie is,this one is better.it's got harrowing action sequences,quite a bit of humour,and more character development.it's not as dark as the first one.instead it has more of hopeful tone.it has strong message too,that is becoming more and more relevant each passing day Arnie is back,but this time his terminator is has more dimensions to his personality.Joe Morton,a terrific(though underrated) actor also plays a prominent role,and is also terrific.Linda Hamilton returns and her character is much more defined and has more to do.she is certainly up to the task.but really,the(human)star of the movie has to be Robert Patrick in what i think was a career making performance.the guy is just amazing.the biggest star of all in this movie would have to be the special effects.they were beyond cutting edge then,and they still stand the test of time today.for me this movie is definitely in my top 10 movies of all time.my vote for Terminator 2:Judgment Day is a perfect 10/10.",10,4,6,23 November 2007
Salt," wall to wall action
","my friend and i thoroughly enjoyed Salt from the get go.it's basically wall to wall action.yes there are no doubt plot holes,and logic gaps,but it's all about the action here.and it's so much fun.plus it's so fast paced,you don't really have time to think about logic or plot,unless you really want to.we just went with it and had a blast.and actually the story is generally well written and has some very clever sequences.if you can just turn your brain off for the allotted run time,you should really enjoy yourself.but if you need you movies to have a high degree of logic and realism,this likely isn't your cup of tea.for me, though,i loved it. 9/10",9,1,4,2 February 2011
Disturbia," better than many of the genre
","this thriller rises above many in the genre,thanks to its tight pacing.there are a couple pulse pounding moments and some genuine suspense.the acting is decent enough for the genre.David Morse is good,as always.Carrie-Ann Moss(who i've always liked)is good but has minimal screen time in a thankless role as Julie Brecht,our main character Kales' mother. the relationship between Kale(Shia LabBeuof)and his hot new next door Neighbour Ashley(Sarah Roemer)felt contrived to me.i never really bought it.besides that though,i enjoyed the movie.it's not a masterpiece but it has its moments.for me Disurbia is a 7/10",7,0,0,3 May 2008
The Patriot," astounding in every way(be warned though,it is brutally violent and bloody)
","i thought this movie was absolutely brilliant.it's set during the time of the American revolution.Benjamin Martin(Mel Gibson)is a simple farmer who does not want to get involved,as he doesn't believe in war.in short,he's a pacifist.that it,until one day a sadistic act of violence is perpetrated against his family.Martin transforms from the meek man he once was,to a man on a mission:to get revenge against the British in general,and the one Britsh officer in particular responsible.so, he becomes the leader of the Colonials.there's a lot of great names in here,and i won't mention them all.but i will mention Jason Isaacs,brilliant as a sadistic British Colonel and Chris Cooper as an American Colonel.i mention Cooper because you are guaranteed to see great acting from him.this movie is quite bloody and brutally violent.there are no punches pulled here.if you have a weak stomach shy away from this one.otherwise,for a war themed movie,i highly recommend it.one of the greatest movies i have ever seen.10+++/10",10,2,7,7 June 2007
Van Helsing," one wild ride
","i don't understand the low rating for(5.4/10)for this movie on this site.i thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout.the basic Gist of the story is this:Van Helsing takes on Count Dracula,The Wolf Man,and the Frankenstein Monster in one adventure.what more could you ask for?this is one fast paced thrill ride,with spectacular action and fight sequences.Hugh Jackman is Van Helsing,and makes the character larger than life.Kate Beckinsale is Anna Valerious,whose family has for centuries tried to rid the world of evil.she teams up with Van Helsing,and the sparks fly.there is no denying the chemistry between the two.i wouldn't call this a scary movie,but it is very intense at times,and a bit morbid.it doesn't take itself seriously though,which works in this case.for me,Van Helsing is an 8/10",8,1,1,24 January 2008
Monsters vs. Aliens," good concept.too bad they didn't explore it more
","this movie doesn't quite live up to the hype for me.that not to so it was a bad movie,because it wasn't.it was entertaining,fairly fast paced.it was over before i knew it.maybe that was the big problem.nothing much really happened in the less than 90 minutes running time.the characters were interesting.the problem is,they were never explored beyond the quick superficial minute or two(if that) explanation of how they came to be.basically,the movie is all potatoes,no meat.it certainly isn't funny.if it is,i must have missed the memo about the funny parts.the concept is good,they just didn't do enough with it.despite it's problems,i did find it entertaining enough to give it a 6/10",6,0,0,31 January 2010
Rocky IV," better than the 3rd film in the series
","Rocky 4 is a better movie than Rocky 3.there is more depth to the story.The villain is a mush greater threat and there is more at stake.the is a second antagonist which Rocky must fight,but you will have to watch the movie to understand.the setting for the movie is also a positive.it is set in Russia in 1985.the movie also has a moral which the three previous ones do not.this movie focuses much more om the training for the final fight than actual fight itself.the fight scenes are well done,but there is less realism.by that,i mean no man could tale any where near the punishment endured by Rocky and remain alive for the duration.other than that,the movie is well done.though not as good as Rocky2,it is a close second to the original.A fine addition to the series. 8/10",8,0,1,2 February 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," just slightly above awful(and i mean slightly)
","first off,i will say this movie is better than 'Anchorman:the Legend of Ron Burgundy.i mention 'Anchorman' Because it has a bit of a connection to 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' in that the producer of 'Anchorman'(Judd Apotow) is also the producer of 'Virgin'.i hated 'Anchorman' saying in my review that 'i would rather have my sinuses scraped'.while i didn't hate 'Virgin' as much as 'Anchorman',i didn't think it was a good movie.there were some amusing moments,and there's a really hot chick in the movie.mostly though,i found it tedious,boring and non funny.there are many lame jokes in here and i don't mean that in any good way.this is one movie to avoid for the most part.i'll give it a 2/10 for the hot chick and nothing else.",2,1,7,30 May 2007
Spider-Man," an awesome big screen debut for spidey
","this first Spiderman is an awesome movie.it has a great story,a great villain and excellent music.the cgi effects were not quite perfect,especially in scenes where spidey is swinging along or leaping from one building to another.however once you are immersed in the story you quickly forget all that.Tobey Maguire seemed an odd choice to play Spidey at,first,but he quickly grows on you.Kirten Dunst does a decent job as the love interest,Mary Jane Watson.However,it is Willem Dafoe who steals the movie with his portrayal of the Green Goblin.the Goblin is a great first villain for Spidey.i do wish though that the had chosen a better costume for him.i like the fact that they stayed fairly true to the comic,and kept Peter Parker/Spider Man as a(sort of)normal human being with problems in his personal life and at school.he is someone the average joe can relate to rather than some godlike being.summing up,this a great first movie for Spidey's big screen debut. 10/10",10,1,2,23 October 2006
Jarhead," a pleasant surprise
","i had no interest in seeing jar head.judging by all the previews,i thought it would be just another boring war movie,at best.however,my buddy had taped it so we decided to give it a try.after all, we had just sat through the train wreck that was silent hill,and it couldn't be any worse.turns out, it was quite a well done movie.its depiction of a company of marines and their lives, during dessert shield and dessert storm,was, i'm sure, an accurate portrayal of military life.giving this movie extra credence is that it is adapted from a novel by Anthony Swofford, who was himself a marine during both dessert shield and dessert storm.The book and the movie chronicle his experience during that time.and while the producers may have taken some dramatic liberty,i believe it does stick close to the facts.Jake Gyllenhall does well as the title character,and Jamie Foxx is very strong as Staff Sgt.Sykes his,commanding officer.Peter Sarsgarrd is also strong as Troy, a fellow marine and friend.and i can't forget Chris Cooper who has a small and memorable role as well,which he infuses with his usual brilliance.I believe the filmmakers did a good job depicting life as a marine waiting for action in Kuwait.the film is well paced, and tightly directed,with very few unnecessary scenes.there are also touches of humour injected into the film.for a movie of this genre,it is surprisingly lighthearted for the most part.it did not feel heavy handed at all,and did not have the cloud of depression hanging over it as most war themed movies do.it did have its dramatic moments of course, but these moments did not oppressively choke the film.all in all, a solid,entertaining piece of work.",7,0,1,27 October 2006
Collateral," hit man coerces cabbie to drive him to his hits
","this is a Micheal Mann film,starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.This has too be Cruise's greatest performance.He plays a hit-man named Vincent who forces a taxi driver named Max(Jamie Foxx) to drive him around all nite to his hits.Cruise is brilliant in this role.Vincent is a conservative,impeccably dressed man somewhere in his fifties.this is a much older character than Cruise usually plays.he is also really great as the villain.he exudes menace from every pore and has ice in his veins.Foxx is good as Max,but the movie belongs to Cruise.Mann makes this movie a real suspenseful nail biter.i think this is on of his better movies.Jada Pinket Smith and Mark Ruffallo are also in the movie with small parts,but both are pretty good in their respective roles,though i though Pinkett Smith was more impressive.i thought this movie was brilliant.i give 'Collateral 10/10",10,3,5,29 May 2007
Ratatouille," i don't see it
","i did not like this animated offering from Pixar.i didn't think it was funny,or even amusing.i did however find it loud and boring.i actually couldn't finish watching his thing,i was that bored.i really wanted to like it,but it did nothing for me.although all is not lost,since i now have something to practice skeet shooting with.i don't know why i didn't like this movie.it just didn't seem to have the zip and wit that many Pixar creations have.the physical comedy bits all fell flatter than a pancake for me.maybe i'm just out to lunch with this movie.it wouldn't be the first time,and i'm sure it won't be the last time.oh well.i will say the movie was well made and looked nice,so that's something.for me,Ratatouille is a 4/10",3,1,3,12 June 2008
Aliens," more sci-fi/action than horror,but a better movie than the origninal
","although Aliens is not the iconic film that alien is,it is still a better film.this film adds a new element by having multiple aliens rather than just the one.it improves upon the look of the creatures,and while maintaining high suspense,adds more action.this film is less character driven than the first.the characters are more developed though and there is more of a group dynamic going on.we have some of the characters fighting each other,as well as the alien threat.the pacing is a bit better in this film.Obviously,this film is not responsible for the rebirth of horror/sci fi,since the original lays claim to that.but it is,in its own right a classic and will be remembered for a long time to come.10/10",10,6,10,2 February 2007
The Fast and the Furious," a fun ride.
","while i admit,this isn't the most smartly written movie,it is fun,especially the races and the chase scenes.some of the souped cars are quite something.there's isn't a great deal of acting required here,as the focus is mainly on the cars.i won't get into the plot,as it's just held together by a thread and there are holes everywhere.there isn't much in the way of character development,but Paul Walker and Vin diesel do have some charisma,and Jordan Brewster is easy on the eyes.things move along at a good clip.it's really a fast food movie.you throw it in,it fills you up,it's over.if you just want to be entertained,this may be what you're looking for.if you want something more substantial,look elsewhere.for me,The Fast and the Furious is a 7/10",7,2,4,28 June 2009
Captain America: Civil War," the best of the Captain America Franchise
","this third instalment in the Captain America franchise is the best one overall.the energy is higher.there is more action and it's funnier.plus,it introduces some great character into the Marvel Cinematic universe.the new(and hopefully improved)Spider-Man(Tom Holland)Ant-Man(Paul Rudd)Jarvis/the Vision(Paul Bettany)Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/the Scarlet Witch.Scarlett Johanson Retuns as Black Widow.and finally Robert Downey Jr. reprises his role of Tony Stark/Iron Man.the action here is off the charts and the time just whizzes by.it's over before you know it even though it is almost two and a half hours long.for me,Captain America: Civil War is a 9/10.",9,1,6,18 September 2016
American History X," deserves its spot of #38 out of the top 250
","this is one gripping,emotionally charged film.the subject matter of racism and its impact is both explosive and controversial.Edward Norton and Edward Furlong both put in award winning performances.Beverly D'Angelo is also great in a very unglamorous role.from the get go,the movie grabs you,and doesn't let go till it's explosive and shocking(though not necessarily surprising)ending.there are several racial slurs uttered here and some brutal violence and very coarse language,but that only adds to the realism of it all.the filmmakers and actors hold nothing back here and it shows.for me,American History X is a 10/10",10,0,5,26 September 2009
Saw III," 3rd installment the natural progression and the best in the series
","i'm not sure where to begin with this,the 3rd installment in the Saw franchise.i guess i'll start with the gore.this film is much gorier and graphic than the first 2.However,it is not gratuitous.it all fits with the story and is essential to the movie.however,there is one sequence which i found stomach churning,which had nothing to do with gore or violence.it's just a sick scene,which really wasn't necessary and i could have done without.for me,this actually lowers the rating of the movie slightly.there is some nudity in this one,and i don't recall the 1st two having any.the traps are more complex in this film,as is the storyline.that is to be expected at this point in the series.while the first film had a rough unpolished feel, as did the 2nd to a lesser extent,this 3rd film is almost slick in its texture,but that doesn't detract from the quality of the film.for me,it is a natural progression for the series.Saw 2 being the best of the franchise to this point,set the bar high and although it's close,i think overall this 3rd film sets a new standard,not just for the series but for the genre.it has more of an emotional impact than the 1st 2 films,and that is no small praise.i give Saw III a 9/10",10,1,2,26 January 2007
The Conjuring 2," outstanding
","I really enjoyed the first The Conjuring.i thought it was well done in every aspect.it was suspenseful and scary and the music was used to good effect.the acting was very good as well.however,The Conjuring 2 blows the original out of the water.it's it's more suspenseful,unnerving and scary.most so called horror movies don't usually scare me,but this one had me thinking about leaving before it was over,because it was so intense.however,i stayed to the end.i can honestly say that this is not only one of the best horror movies I have seen in years,it is also one of the best movies period I have seen in years.for me, THe Conjuring 2 is a 10/10",10,0,0,31 August 2016
Die Hard 2," McClane is at it again
","this is still a good movie,although it's not as good as the first one.for one thing,it's a lot slower paced and there is less action.John McClane is once again the only person who seems to be standing in the way of terrorists carrying out there plan.this time,it just happens to an airport which is the scene.Bruce Willis is back as McClane,of course,and he actually has some more and funnier lines than in the first.William Sadler plays the main bad guy in this one,and puts in a great performance.i liked his character better than the main villain in the first movie.the biggest problem with this movie,like i mentioned,is the pacing.it is a bit slow especially compared to the first one.but that makes a big difference in how enjoyable it is is.it's just not as fun or thrilling.for me,Die Hard 2 is a 7/10",7,23,38,16 February 2008
Resident Evil," it didn't work for me
","i watched this movie a few years ago and remember liking it.but not this time.honestly,this movie is just one long bore,with a bit of action thrown in occasionally.it just doesn't work for me,plain and simple.there are two good things about it though.one is the pretty decent makeup effects,and the other is the music,kind of a techno/trance cross.otherwise,this felt like one of the longest 100 minutes of my life.to me,Doom is a better movie.it's fun and doesn't take itself seriously.Maybe Resident Evil would have been better if they had made it a bit lighter,or at least added some humour.or maybe not.but for whatever reason,i just didn't like it.for me,Resident Evil is a 3/10",3,0,2,16 August 2007
Quantum of Solace," not as good as casino Royale
","this Bond film is much darker than Casino Royale,(which i thought was brilliant)the previous one.Bond is it's also the only one that is a continuation of a previous Bond film,as far as i know.this one has a fair amount of action,which are all well done,but ti also has its slow spots.the storyline is not as fleshed as i thought it could have been.there are some characters that had very little to do.however,i still enjoyed the film.i just don't feel it was on the same level of Casino Royale.i would still recommend it as worth watching.but lets hope the next Bond film is an improvement.for me,Quantum of Solace is a 6/10",6,1,3,26 March 2011
Independence Day," great potential,but suffers from too many flaws
","independence day looked like it could be a good,even great movie.it has great actors,and loads of action.it also has some humour courtesy will smith and jeff goldblum.goldblum is the perfect straight man for smith's witty quips and one liners and even ads a bit of his own brand of comedy to the mix.these two play off each other very well,and there is undeniable comedic chemistry between the two.the supporting cast is also very strong.and then there is the premise.aliens invade the world and the military must save the day.not a bad premise,although not original.there must be something new added to the mix or this becomes just another alien invasion movie.the question is,is there anything original in this movie?true,the comedic element is a step in the right direction.but is in enough own its own?not quite.there are problems which overshadow the positive aspects of the film,one of them being the special effects,which admittedly are well done.however,they are overpowering in this movie.the viewer is bombarded with explosion after explosion.independence day becomes a movie about the special effects, so the characters take a back seat for most of the movie.true,there are some touching dramatic moments in the middle to latter stages of the film,but the characters are not given enough screen time to be developed,so there is less of the human feel than there might otherwise be.another problem is the film goes more than a little overboard with the flag waving patriotism.there is nothing wrong with patriotism,unless it is taken overboard.there is an inspirational speech given by the the American president,which seems like it is patterned after a speech by winston churchill during the second world war.however,in this case it comes of as maudlin and absurd.bill pullman,fine actor he may be,is no winston churchill,and does not have the charisma or screen presence to carry this speech off.it is a real eyes glazed over and rolled back in the head moment.not believable.which lead us to the dialogue.aside from the president's speech there are are other examples of cringe worthy dialogue.the actors cannot therefore take total responsibility for this.the writers should shoulder some of the blame. finally there is the discovery which leads to the eventual defeat of the aliens.in my my mind the odds of things happening this way are astronomical at best.so,basically the movie(although entertaining)fails for the most,and is moderately successful in other parts.end result: 4* out of 10",4,1,3,19 October 2006
The Butterfly Effect," decent time travel movie
","this movie has a good premise.going back in time to change your present or future and the ramifications this could have.it's not an original premise,but it's 1 that hasn't been done to death yet.at least i don't think so.the movie has some good dramatic moments and some suspense ,but i didn't really find it all that compelling.it is quite disturbing in some scenes.i think this is Ashton Kutcher's first big starring dramatic role,and i didn't quite buy him in the role.he has improved since then,though,most notably in 'The Guardian' also starring Kevin Costner.in the 'The Butterfly Effect' he seems a bit over his head.Amy Smart is also in this movie,and is good as always.my vote for 'The Butterfly Effect':6/10",6,2,2,9 July 2007
Alien vs. Predator," much better than i had anticipated
","i really like this movie,although i will say that any semblance to the story lines of both the Predator and Alien franchise has been thrown out the window.still,it is an interesting storyline,and i like the good back story.i thought that both The Alien and predator creatures were very well done,and they even had some character to them.the action in this one is first rate.the one thing i didn't like was the cast.none of the characters inspired any interest,except for one.Sanaa Lathan's character(Alexa Woods) was well written and interesting,and she was also very credible in her role.as for the rest of the cast,the characters were pointless.but the good news is,the humans are only a small part of this film, so its success does not hinge on them.they are merely plot devices,nothing more.the focal point of the movie is the Aliens and the Predators,and they do not disappoint.the fight scenes between these 2 evenly matched enemies are very,very well done and thrilling.both are pretty much evenly matched,which pleasantly surprised me.i had my idea of which of the 2 would be the better fighters.i won't say which.the point is,this is a well made movie and undeserving(in my opinion)of the low rating it has.(5.4/10).naturally the purists,or most of then anyway,believe this movie ruins the franchise.i happen to disagree.it's a separate entity and isn't trying to be just another Alien or Predator movie.so instead of being a rip-off,it has its own story with added dimensions.by the way,i'm willing to bet those same purists would also criticize the film if it had have been a rip-off.regardless,i say give it a chance before just parroting what all the critics have to say.for me 'AVP:Alien vs Predator' is a 9/10",9,0,2,19 May 2007
No Country for Old Men," well told story
","i've seen a few of the Coen Brothers movies,and didn't really like most of them.i just thought they were too weird.but this one's different.it seems more based in reality.these characters could exist and their actions are plausible.i also thought the characters were well defined within the confines of the movie.this is a dark movie,for sure.the story is set in 1980,and is more or less told from the point of view of the local sheriff and his perspective on the changing times and the new breed of criminal.this is a crime drama,but it's also a western of sorts.it's violent,but not as much as many other movies.this is a character and dialogue driven movie.i thought it was well done.it's not an action packed movie.in fact,it may seem a bit slow at times but the story is told well enough,and the characters are interesting and engaging enough that it never becomes boring.in fact,i found it very compelling.i liked everything about this movie. No country for Old Men is a 10/10",10,1,5,15 March 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," well written and well acted
","this is more than just a movie about the killing of Jesse James.the story is about the event leading up to the title and the aftermath.it's a well done movie with great performances from Brad Pitt as James,Sam Rockwell as Charlie Ford,and Casey Affleck as Robert Ford.the supporting performances are also very good.this is not an action film,but a deliberately paced character study.the film is well written and has some very good dialogue.it also has a voice over narration,which i thought worked well with this movie.it does tend a bit toward slowness,but only for brief moments and only occasionally,and is never boring.the story and characters are quite compelling.i found myself quite engrossed in the story and the characters.for me,The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a 9/10",9,2,5,15 March 2008
Batman Begins," one of the best superhero movies ever made
","Batman Begins is easily one of the best superhero movies ever made.the movie basically tells the story of the genesis of the caped crusader.obviously,there is a fair amount of character development involved,which you would expect based on the title.but not so much that the film becomes tedious.Batman is shown as more of a full dimensional character than in previous incarnations.this version is also more faithful to the comic.Director Christopher Nolan shows great skill as a director,pacing the film very well.there are also some touches of humour throughout and we get to see a more human side to Bruce Wayne.The villains are also more fully realized than in most movies of the genre,instead of simply being devices for the hero(the protagonist)to have a villain(antagonist)to defeat.Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are standouts in their respective roles,as is Liam Neeson.Katie Holmes Has yet to reach the level of maturity require for her role,so she is a bit weak.This Batman movie is less cartoonish than previous efforts,and is closer to the realm of realism(relatively speaking)the movie is also more thoughtful than many movies depicting superheros there is much more substance.in fact more substance than style,though it is just stylistic enough.All in all a brilliant depiction of the origin of the caped crusader.this movie sets the bar high for its successor,the Dark Knight,which is to be released sometime in 2008. 10/10",10,8,12,5 January 2007
Meet the Fockers," decent,but lackluster follow up to the original
","The follow up to Meet the Parents is generally a decent film.not as funny as the first,and a bit tedious at times,but all in all not a bad effort.In this installment,Pam's parents,the Byrnes(Robert Deniro and Blythe Danner)meet Greg's parent's,the Fockers(Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand).the two families are like night and day,which should make for some hilarity,but fall a bit flat.there are some funny moments,just not as many as there could be,and this movie is not always entertaining.there are some spots that lag or scenes that could have been cut.the movie doesn't flow as smoothly as it should.The acting is fine.it is the material that is lackluster.i believe there are plans for a third installment.if so lets hope they iron out any bugs and maybe the third will be more on par with the first.this movie is average,but could have been so much more. 5* out of 10",5,0,0,1 January 2007
The Princess Bride," exquisite
","i remember seeing little bits and pieces of this movie throughout the years.but i had never seen the full movie.until now.i wish i had seen it sooner,but it was more than worth the wait.this thing is a masterpiece.it's a fantasy/romance/comedy/adventure.my sides were splitting from the endless sight gags,some subtle,some not.plus,the movie is very touching.there is a veritable who's' who of famous people of the time,some when they were just starting out.it was directed by Rob Reiner,and it also reminded me of Mel Brook's type of humour.this is #186 of the top 250 and deservedly so.if you're feeling down,throw this in.if you're not uplifted and aching from laughter,i'd be very surprised.for me,The Princess Bride is a 10/10",10,5,10,3 August 2009
The Pianist," powerful wartime drama about one humble man and his music
","this is an absolutely brilliant movie set during World War 2.it stars Adrian Brody as Jewish musician Wladyslaw Szpilman,whose only escape from the wartime hell is playing the piano.the screenplay is written by Ronald Harwood,based on the book by the real life Wladyslaw Szpilman,and is directed by Roman Polanski.the movie is touching and heartwarming,and also heartbreaking at times.it can be depressing,but is is also an inspiration.one man survives hell through music.but more than that that,others too are uplifted and have hope,all because of one humble pianist.Brody is brilliant ,as always,inhabiting his character,as he always does.i don't think he's made a bad movie yet.or at least,he's always been great in every film,even if the film itself isn't.in this case,though,the film is brilliant. and say what you want about Polanski,he knows how to direct a movie(we won't count 'Rosemary's Baby').if this film doesn't have an impact on you,i'd be surprised.",10,0,2,3 June 2007
28 Days Later...," not a zombie movie,but much more
","28 days later is a well made film.it has good performances from its main actors,it is suspenseful,and there are some scary moments.the director maintains tension throughout the movie.the make up effects in the film are very well done, so that the infected look much less than human,quite horrifying in fact.the action sequences are well done as are the dramatic moments.this a not a zombie movie per Se,but a movie about human relations and interaction in the face of what seems like hopelessness.the most horrifying thing in the movie is its premise,which is: plague has spread throughout the land,infecting people and turning them into animalistic creatures,not quite zombies,but not human either having no thought other than attacking and infecting the uninfected.it shows the desperation that some people are willing to go through to survive.it depicts a small band of soldiers who at first were prepared to save the lives of as many people as they could.however,having been all alone with no female companionship for a long time,they take in a small group of survivors,one man and two females, one just a teenager.this seeming act of kindness comes with a price however as the men plan to keep the women as slaves for their sexual gratification.in essence they become like animals themselves no better than the 'creatures' they are fighting.i won't spoil any more of the story except to say that there is a hopeful,if not happy ending. .this is a well crafted movie all around.it is a deep movie with a message and it asks some very scary questions.highly recommended 8* out of 10",8,5,8,15 October 2006
JFK," exceptional
","i found this film about the assassination of John f. Kennedy and the aftermath to be riveting and compelling.it mixes historical fact with speculation and conjecture and paints an interesting picture of what might have transpired on that day and just who might have been involved,and how far reaching the conspiracy(if you believe there was one)goes.it doesn't give any definitive answers.it's up to the viewer to draw their own conclusions.the acting is stellar here from all concerned.my only real large complaint about the film is Joe Pesci's character.Pesci must have it written into every contract that his character must drop the f bomb at least every other word.i grew quickly irritated with it.it just wasn't necessary.aside from that,though,this is an exceptional film.even though it's close to 305 minutes,it doesn't feel like that at all.for me, JFK is a 9/10",9,1,11,4 October 2010
2012," it was entertaining
","if nothing else,this end of the world flick form disaster specialist Roland Emmerich was entertaining.there sure was a lot of CGI used here.in fact probably ninety percent of the movie is comprised of it. December 21,2012 is the day that the Mayans predict a cataclysmic event will occur on earth,which has led to speculation that the world as we know will cease to exist.the movie only makes passing reference of the Mayan's,and instead just focus on on the destruction and mayhem side of things.maybe it's just me,but the special effects don't seems to have improved much in the last six years or so since the The Day After Tomorrow another big budget disaster opus,also from Roland Emmerich,which had a nearly comparable amount of CGI.or maybe i'm just jaded,and CGI really isn't that exciting more.either way,2012 failed to fully engage me,on an excitement level.the movie does however,has one thing in its favour.unlike many flicks of the genre,there were no real maudlin or sappy moments,no over the top corn ball inspirational speeches.and i loved Woody Harrelson's character.i also thought Thandie Newton was good as well.the movie wasn't boring.and for a movie that clocks in at 150 minutes before the end credits roll,that's something.for me,2012 is a 6/10",6,0,1,6 March 2010
Ghost Rider," Ghost Rider makes the leap from comic book to screen
","as far as comic book adaptations go,this is not a bad movie,i can't say how accurate it is to its source material,but i didn't mind it.it's basically about a young motorcycle stuntman named Johnny Blaze.as a young man.johnny is tricked into selling his soul to the devil for reasons revealed in the movie.years later,the devil calls upon his services as 'Ghost Rider' a flame skulled entity from the dark side who is basically the devil's bounty hunter.i liked this movie quite a bit,although it seemed a bit rushed.i think they could have fleshed it out a bit more.but to be fair,there is some voice over narration in the film,which does provide an overview of the whole Ghost Rider Legend.if you're a fan of the comic,you probably know all you need to know.Nic Cage,as the older Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider is well cast.he seems to suit the role well and is believable(in the context of the movie).i like the music.it went well with the movie.there is a lot of action in the movie and some cgi,which is well done,but not groundbreaking or anything.(although Ghost Rider's flaming skull was kinda cool)The beautiful and talented Eva Mendes plays the love interest,but her screen time is far too short.her character should have had more to do.she is very charismatic,so the scenes she was in left me wanting more.oh, well,hopefully her character will play a larger role in the sequel.as for the movie itself,my friend and i had free passes,so i can't really complain.it is a fun movie to watch,but doesn't linger long after viewing.i will go see the sequel when it comes out,as i believe it will probably improve on this one. 8/10",8,4,6,18 February 2007
Hellboy," entertaining,but missing something (6.5/10)
","i kinda liked this offering from Guillermo Del Toro.it's a sort of science fiction action adventure hybrid,with some humour thrown in.there's a great mix of oddball characters,some good stunts,and the look of the film is fantastic.the movie also has a great assortment of weird creatures.yet i came away feeling a bit empty,like there was something missing.despite all the good things about the movie,i guess i felt it had very little heart or soul.having said that,from a shallow point of view,i liked it.it isn't boring.i just think it had the potential to be more.when you add it all up,my vote for Hellboy is a 6.5/10",7,0,0,30 December 2008
P.S. I Love You," touching
","i found this romantic drama to be a pleasant surprise.it's well written,with good dialogue.the acting,especially from the principles,Hilary Swank,and Gerard Butler is terrific.the movie is very touching and tender,without being depressing,and there are even some humorous moments.i also found it authentic for the most part.there are a few things i didn't like.one of them was Lisa Kudro's character.i found her vulgar and crude,and whenever she was on screen,she changed the tenor of the movie,not in a good way.there were also a few scenes which i thought cheapened thew movie a bit.you'll know what i mean if you watch the movie.i also didn't buy the friendship between Holly(Swank) and that of Kudro's and Gina Gershon's characters.they just seemed out of place to me.i think it is a case of miscasting.despite the problems with the the movie,i still found it worth watching.i give P.S. I Love You an 8/10",8,1,2,10 May 2008
The Mist," eerie and ironic
","this adaptation of a Stephen King short story,directed by Frank Darabont(who also wrote the screenplay)is quite entertaining,though no masterpiece.there are some bloody moments and some excitement.the acting,although adequate,does not stand out.except in two cases.the first being Andre Braugher,who plays Norton,the neighbour of Tom Jane's character.i found him quite strong in his role,and very charismatic.the other is Marcia Gay Harden,who is brilliant as Mrs. Carmody.i liked the ironic ending of the movie,which i didn't expect,though i probably should have.the music is also very haunting,perfect for the movie.when all is said and done,The Mist is a 7/10",7,0,2,8 August 2009
Stardust," decent fantasy adventure movie
","this fantasy adventure movie is not as good as i'd hoped,but it's still pretty good.it does plod along though for the fist 60 minutes or so,then it pickup for about 20 minutes.from there it slows down,but not as slow as it had been previously.the last 30 minutes are quite good,in my opinion.things really pick up here,with some great action and excitement.this movie has some original ideas in it,but it also borrows from other movies.there are some pretty big name actors in this one.and all put in terrific performances.Robert De Niro in particular,gets to have the most fun with his role,i think.he really lets loose.anyway,this movie definitely has its good moments.for me,Stardust is a 6/10",6,1,3,12 January 2008
I Am Legend," ...and i am merely confused
","why?well,i'm glad you asked.the reason is quite simple.this movie seems to have gotten rave reviews,and it has a high rating(7.7/10)on this site.this really astounds me,since we are talking about a movie that has no real story,is dragged out and boring,and has underwhelming looking CG creatures.this movie is just over 90 minutes,but it sure felt a lot longer.my friend told me i fell asleep for about 10 minutes,but i did not miss anything,as he also said the movie was boring and nothing had happened in those 10 minutes.nothing really happens of any consequence here in 90 minutes either.i felt for poor Will Smith,having to carry a movie about nothing.he does his best,but when you have nothing to work with,it's an uphill and futile battle.for me,this is the most overrated movie i have seen since Pirates 1.anyway,i give I am Legend a 3/10",3,24,89,20 December 2007
The Bourne Legacy," not horrible,but not great
","for me,although this movie was decent,it didn't really feel like a Bourne movie,mainly because the character of Jason Bourne isn't in it.that's not to say it's a bad movie,because it isn't.it just doesn't stack up to the three previous Bourne films in terms of action characterization and dialogue.the story was okay,but again not overly compelling none of the actors can be blamed.they all put in good efforts.this film just had too big a pair of shoes to fill.Tony Gilroy(Duplicity,Michael Clayton) directed and co-wrote the screenplay.as far as I can recall,none of the characters or actors from the three previous film appear in this,although I could be out to lunch on that.for me,The Bourne Legacy is a 6/10",6,1,4,15 September 2016
Dog Day Afternoon," very raw and gritty
","this crime drama is based on an actual event that took place a few years before the release of the movie.basically it's about a bank robbery gone horribly wrong,from the get go.it's a slow mover,but there are some great quiet dramatic moments,as well s some great dialogue exchanges that must have been add libbed.unfortunately as the movie wears on,it becomes increasingly depressing,and harder to watch.it isn't a movie i could watch again right away.it just takes too much out of you.as for the acting,well,Al Pacino is good in the lead,and really brought out the intensity and hopelessness his character feels.but i really thought John Cazale was brilliant as the brooding,ticking time bomb,Sal.look for many cameos by actors just getting their start,as well.for me,Dog Day Afternoon is a 6/10",6,1,2,3 September 2009
Amadeus," riveting and compelling
","my roommate and i both enjoyed this film on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.it's basically told from the perspective of Antonio Salieri(F. Murray Abraham).the movie may or may not be historically accurate,but so what.it isn't a documentary.it's a Hollywood film,so of course dramatic liberties have been taken.the point is,it a beautiful looking film.the music is superb.the acting is first rate.the costume are exquisite.the tension is at times palpable and there is comic relief.Tom Hulce doesn't get a lot of recognition as an actor,but he is certainly brilliant here as Mozart.Jeffrey Jones has a great turn as well as Emperor Joseph II.Roy Dotrice is also a standout as Mozart's Father Leopold.all told,this a remarkable achievement. 9/10",9,0,1,2 September 2010

Nicholas is dead set against going to the address listed on the card,but eventually relents.he signs up for 'The Game' and his life is forever altered. weird and bizarre occurrences start to happen and Nicholas can no longer tell 'The Game' from reality.tragedy occurs and Nicholas begins to lose his tenuous grip on sanity.to say anything else would give too much away.let's just say,the film is suspenseful,action packed and filled with twists ans turns that will keep you guessing.very well made film.more than worth your time. 8/10",8,1,2,14 January 2007

The Hurt Locker," an eloquent poetic ballet
","wow.just finished watching this film about an hour ago,and i'm still trying to put it into words.it's basically about an elite military bomb squad unit in Iraq,whose job is made tougher because they are still very much in a combat situation.this a very powerful moving experience.riveting right to the last frame.nail biting suspense.great acting.sometimes the quite moments speak louder and more clearly than any words can.the movie is very well constructed.its all so eloquent,like a poem,a ballet.the running time may just be shy of one hundred and thirty minutes,but it sure doesn't feel that long.i could watch this film again without hesitation.war themed movies are not everyone's cup of tea obviously,but if you are a fan of the genre,you owe it to yourself to check this film out.i haven't seen a film this good in a long time.for me,The Hurt Locker is a 10/10",10,11,30,7 March 2010
The Longest Day," should be in the top 250,in my opinion
","this may not be the greatest war film ever made but it ranks right up there in my opinion.i'm actually surprised this isn't in the top 250 movies.it tells the story of the hours leading up to and including the D-Day invasion by the Allies.but it's unique in that it gives the perspective of not just Allies(The British,Americans,Canadians,The French Resistance)but also of the Germans.it's just shy of three hours but doesn't feel like it at all.there's a veritable who's who of famous actors of the time(and some that would become famous),but the star of the movie isn't any of the actors.it's the Invasion itself that's the star.for me,The Longest Day is a 9/10",9,2,4,10 February 2011

The Illusionist," romance,mystery,suspense all add up to a very good movie
","i liked this movie a lot.i thought the acting was very good.Jessica Biel really impressed me in her role.she really brought some depth to her character,and proved that she definitely has talent.she held her own against some real heavyweights in the film.i also liked the setting of Vienna sometime in the 19th century,i believe.i think Vienna is really appropriate,because,to me it seems like it would be a romantic city.the movie has a romantic air to it,but it is also a mystery/suspense film.i thought the story was also very good,and well told.the characters had some dimension to them,at least i think they did. i liked the ending,even though it was anti-climatic.it fit with the rest of the movie.by that i mean it all makes sense at the end,but you have to think about it a bit.if you enjoy movies that are challenging,and if you are a bit of a romantic,(even if you're not)you will probably like 'The Illusionist'.for me,this movie is about 8.5/10",9,0,0,16 March 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," again,lacks the epic quality it should have,but it doesn't exactly suck
","well,at least it didn't suck.but it wasn't as good as the potential hinted at.i guess it's maybe slightly better than the first one,but barely.the story is interesting and has some merit,but the execution of the film left me empty.the Silver Surfer is a pretty cool looking character,but i wish the character had been developed more.Having Laurence Fishburne voice the Surfer was a definite plus,as his voice fit the character perfectly.no disrespect to Doug Jones,who physically played the character.i'm mot sure i've heard Doug Jone's voice,so all i can comment on is Fishburne.like the first one,this movie is too short and seems rushed.it lacks the epic quality this type of movie should have.another problem is the characters didn't really have to do much more or different than they did in the first one.having said that,the movie is entertaining,if not compelling.even with it's problems,i'd give 'Fantastic Four:Rise of the Silver Surfer' 7/10.as a final word,if another installment or a possible Silver Surfer spin off,is planned as rumored,one can only hope they pull out all the stops and make whatever's next into what it really should be:an epic tale worthy of its source material.otherwise,there's no point and they should stop right now.",7,2,5,17 June 2007

Men in Black II," much inferior to the original
","here we have case of a sequel much inferior to the original.there are very few laughs in this movie.also,the filmmakers decided to make the film more serious.this is it's downfall.the formula that made the first one so successful was taking a comedic approach to the subject matter(alien invasion).i also thought the main villain was weak and uninteresting.there is less comedic banter between agent k and agent j(Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.the writing wasn't as clever this time around. and there's no sense of irony,which is what provided much of the humour of the first one.it's as if they used up all the good ideas with the first one.there are still some funny bits but not nearly enough.sadly this movie taints the franchise by going out on a low night.this is just another average movie in the genre.as a result, 'Men in Black 2' is a 5/10 in my books",5,0,2,24 May 2007

Million Dollar Baby," new shoes?30$------Million Dollar Baby?priceless
","every once in awhile,a movie comes along that defies description.Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is that movie.One of the best movies ever made by one of the greatest directors,this is a movie that will not leave you untouched.Paul Haggis(Crash) wrote the screenplay for this cinematic treasure and the stage was set.with Eastwood as Director,the next piece of puzzle was the cast.And what a cast.You have Hilary Swank in a moving,powerhouse performance in the lead role.you have Eastwood himself in strong supporting role.and you have the great Morgan freeman in an understated,but no less superb performance.these three make it seem so effortless.the rest of the supporting players are also strong.I don't want to give too much away,for those who haven't had the pleasure yet.the basics of the film are as follows.Hilary Swank is Maggie Fitzgeraldd a woman who has nothing-but a desire to be a boxer.Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn,a grizzled boxing trainer,hardened by life.Morgan freeman is Eddie Dupris aka 'Scrap',Frankie's lone friend and Manager of his boxing club.Maggie walks into Frankie's life one day,desperate for him to train her.Frankie refuses at first and Maggie never gives up.Frankie finally relents(with a bit of help from 'scrap'.and the stage is set.What follows is the growing relationship between Maggie,Frankie and 'Scrap' and the lessons they learn nd teach each other.until the end,with a closing act you won'soon(if ever) forget.",10,1,2,7 January 2007
Donnie Brasco," a top notch gangster flick(Depp does it again)
","now this,is a good movie.It is based on the Book co written by Joseph.D Pistone and Richard Woodley,chronicling undercover FBI agent Pistone and his life as 'Donnie Brasco'.Brasco/Pistone infiltrates the New York mafia,and befriends 'Lefty Ruggiero',(Al Pacino)becoming close to him in time.Donnie collects information for the FBI,and over time his mob persona begins to assert itself.as a result,his family life falls apart and Donnie faces a dilemma.if he stays undercover,he risks being found out and executed.if he is pulled out,'Lefty' will be executed for allowing him to infiltrate the organization.Johhny Depp plays Brasco/Pistone and delivers a very compelling performance.Pacino plays 'Lefty' and is equally believable.this is the 2nd gangster movie i have seen,(Casino being the first,and lesser of the 2)and i must say,i am impressed.Anne Heche plays Maggie Pistone and does very well as the wife who sees her husband less often than the mobsters.her role is not that large,but is important to the movie.others in the film include James woods, Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, and the great(but very underrated) actress Gretchen Mol has a small role. all deliver excellent performances.but it is Depp's performance as Brasco that anchors this movie.his performance is what sells the story. 'Donnie Brasco' gets a strong 9/10",9,0,0,24 January 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Edward. R Murrow vs senator Joseph McCarthy
","i just watched good night,and good luck,which is about CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow and his fight against senator Joseph McCarthy, a junior senator from Wisconsin,during the 1950's.this was a time of hysteria regarding communists and communist sympathizers in America and anyone else who may have had dealings with them.it was basically a time where anyone who was deemed a threat to national security was targeted by senator McCarthy and others in hearings held against them.many of these people lost their jobs or worse based on little or no evidence against them.that is the premise of the movie good night and good luck.it is based on a true story,but you have to take it with a grain of salt as it is biased on the side of Edward R. Murrow and other people who share his view and opinions.obviously it is slanted towards the view of the people who made the film.so you really have to make up your own mind about how accurate it might or might not be.however,as simply a movie,it is very entertaining,with great performances all around from an ensemble cast.it is well directed and shooting it in black and white was very effective.at times however,it was preachy,which was annoying,and i'm still not sure why Murrow ended each broadcast with the words'good night and good luck' and i found that a bit annoying.i would have liked the filmmakers to give an explanation for those words,maybe show the genesis behind them and give them more meaning,put them into context.i'm not saying whether the movie was accurate or not,and can only rate it for it's entertainment value as well as its technical merit.overall,the film was well made, with a good eye for detail of the era,and it had a very authentic feel about it.it was well paced with crisp dialogue and for a drama it was better done than many films of the genre.it was at times engaging,yet not quite riveting.the only other complaint i have is that it could have had more substance and been a bit more in-depth.otherwise,i enjoyed it. 6*",6,2,3,18 October 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," faster pace,more action than the first,still not that great
","i guess this movie is better than the first Resident Evil.there is more action and a bit of humour,which is sorely lacking in the first one.and i like the characters more in this one.i think it was a better mix of personalities.what i didn't like is the story.this one is more about the action and there is quite a bit more than the first one.you know,people getting shot and dying,lots of stuff blowing up,that sort of thing.sometimes the movie borders on the ridiculous with some of the stunts they do.plus there is some totally gratuitous nudity that does nothing to movie the story.don't get me wrong,i like nudity as much as the next guy,but it should have some point.anyway,if you're an action junkie,you might like this movie.other than that,there's not much here.having said that,i do you like it better than the first movie,because it is not mind numbingly boring,as the first one was.4/10",4,0,1,16 August 2007
Caddyshack," you're joking,right?
","i had hear a lot about how great this movie is,over the years.so imagine my shock and disappointment to find out it's pure crap.i didn't find it funny,or amusing,or even entertaining.i swear i never even smiled once.i realise this is just my opinion of course,but i can't get over the high score (7.3/10)this movie has on this site.it boggles the mind.anyway,for whatever reason,i didn't think this was a good movie at all.in fact,it's brutal.there are some big comedy names of the era in this one,so you'd think that would count for something.but it doesn't seem to,at least in my opinion.i'm sure i'm in the minority,but my vote for Caddyshack is a dismal 1/10",1,18,41,30 December 2007
The Evil Dead," works well for what it is
","A while back,i did review of Evil Dead 2,which called absolute garbage.well,i stand by that review.however,it is only fair to give a review of its predecessor,so here goes.'Evil Dead' is a pretty decent movie,offering up some genuine chills.one particularly effective scene involved one of the female characters and half of the woods come to life.the acting was decent.with no hammy overacting which is what plague its successor.there was not much comedy in this movie.it was played pretty straight,and was effective for the most part.the plot was pretty straight forward although bizarre to say the least.the demons were quite revolting.this was a low budget movie,but that did not detract from the overall feel.creepy,to be sure.i think this movie was effective because it didn't try to be something it was not.it is not a masterpiece,nor does it try to be one.i enjoyed it a quite a bit. 6/10",6,1,3,5 November 2006
Saw II," better than the first, and that's saying a lot
","if you liked saw, you will really like saw 2.it improves upon the original,surprisingly.there were more characters and the setting has changed slightly.whereas in the original,most of the story takes place in one room,there are now more rooms.the traps are more inventive than the original,there is more action and a group dynamic going on,setting the stage for a sort of mob mentality among some of the characters.this time we have a new group of characters.in this bunch there are some truly evil individuals,lumped in with some that are not.this is, good as it allows you to play some characters off each other. you still have your sympathetic characters to root for,and you also have the others that you can hope meet a grisly end. of course, the original villain is back and one other character from the original also returns.there is a higher budget this time around,hence a more polished look to the film, which works here.there is a twist ending, which was a bit of a surprise,setting up the soon to be released saw 3 nicely.and there is also a healthy dose of gore.what else can i say?saw 2 is highly recommended.if you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? 8.5*",9,1,2,7 October 2006
Clash of the Titans," decent enough remake
","i definitely didn't like this remake as much as the original version,but it's still not that bad,all things considered.it deviates considerably story wise from the original.the basic framework is still the same,but a lot of particulars have been changed.Perseus is a much different type of character.his journey is much different.the focus is on different characters as well.there are certainly some exciting moment in this one.there is no nudity or profanity that i can recall.there was a bit of miscasting in the acting department in this one,whereas in the first one,i thought the acting was aces all around.otherwise though,this was a fairly decent movie.for me,Clash of the Titans (2010) is a 6/10",6,0,1,9 October 2010
Jurassic World," much more epic than the original
","in my opinion this this entry in the Jurassic franchise is better than the original.it's more suspenseful and exciting.the acting is superb headlined by Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt.it's much more epic than its predecessors.i thought the story was good,as well.the CGi is is pretty close to perfection.i wish they had brought back Jeff Goldblum though.i liked the quirkiness he brought to the the character in both the original Jurassic Park and and the second in the series,the Lost Worlld:Jurassic Park.but that's a small issue.other than that,i really had a blast watching this film.Colin Trevorrow directed the film and will also be directing Star Wras XI as well as the sequel to Jurassic World,both of which I am looking forward to.for me,Jurassic World is a 10/10",10,1,3,18 September 2016
Mission: Impossible II," not hard to follow,but the script blew up in the first of way too many explosions
","this movie is a different beast than the first one.oh,sure,it has some of the same characters and is also a spy movie/secret agent film.whereas the first one was so convoluted,you needed a map to follow it,this sequel doesn't suffer from that same deficiency.it's much easier to follow alright.the reason being that they sacrificed story and character for nothing but wall to wall action.now,i'm all for action,but not at the expense of everything else.when this was over,i felt liked i'd been in the Iron Man Triathlon.not only that,but there is next to now believability in this, at least in the stunt dept.the could have made the costumer's job a lot easier by having the characters all wear a red cape and blue underwear.at least there would have been some believability.also,it seems everything in the movie blew up somewhere along the way.i think the script blew up as well.certainly this movie was more exciting than the first one,but there be some balance.i'll give 'Mission Impossible 2 a 6/10",6,1,2,24 May 2007
The Adjustment Bureau," what if there was a predetermined plan mapped out for your life?
","i enjoyed this film based on the short story by Philip K. Dick.the premise is that we are not in control of our destiny,that their is a plan for our lives.if we deviate from that plan,there is a small group of men who are sent to get us back on track,and following the predetermined plan.if we refuse to accept the plan and continue to deviate,the consequences can be dire both on an individual level and on a larger scale.This is what happens to David Norris(Matt Damon)who wants more than what fate has planed for him,and so he gets a visit from The Adjustment Bureau.i won't go any further into the plot.you'll have to watch to the film to find out more.suffice to say,the movie is entertaining,thought provoking and compelling.for me,The Adjustment Bureau is an 8/10",8,0,1,6 May 2011
For Love of the Game," third Kevin Costner baseball themed film
","in my opinion,this third baseball themed film starring Kevin Costner(directed by Sam Raimi)is the best of the three.it is fairly long at about 130 minutes or so,but it's worth it.for one thing,there some character development and a bit of back story.the writing and the story are strong.the movie is mostly pure dram/but there a romance angle thrown in.but they didn't lay it on too thick,so it's not unwatchable.there is a lot of baseball actually being played here,but most of what we see(both during the baseball scenes and most of the other scenes as well)is through the eyes of Costner character.baseball is portrayed as being not just a game but life itself,something magical and profound,and that is conveyed very well here.by the filmmakers and by the actors,especially Costner.the supporting cast is great,but this really is Costner's show.he puts in a very deep performance.Sam Raimi directed this masterpiece.for me,For Love of the Game is a 9/10",9,0,1,4 January 2010
Avengers: Age of Ultron," surpasses the original in my opinion
","I liked this sequel more than the original.as usual there is a ton of intense action sequences.it's also a very funny movie and once again the acting is as good as or better than in the original.there are also a few more marvel characters dropped into the mix.but the one thing that makes this film superior to the first(in my opinion,anyway)is the villain Ultron.this is one of the best villains to come along in the last few years.he is certainly a worthy adversary to the Avengers.Havin James Spader voice the character was a stroke of genius,in my mind.his voice just fits the character so well.overall,an excellent film.so far,Marvel is winning the superhero sweepstakes against DC,for two very important reasons.firstly,humour,second a relatively lighter tone.DC films tend to be dark and bleak.until DC figures this out,they will continue to lose ground to Marvel.this is just my opinion of course.anyway,for me Avengers: Age of Ultron is a 9/10",9,0,3,19 September 2016
Major League," entertaining and amusing,though not insanely funny baseball movie
","i thought this was a pretty good movie.it wasn't insanely funny or anything,but it had some amusing moments and was certainly entertaining.what i liked about this movie is is the fact that,although it's an underdog story,it is not preachy and schmaltzy.there's very little rah,rah,rah,everyone's a winner clap trap.it just goes to show that a movie can tell an under dog story,without hitting you over the head with it,and making you nauseous.i also liked the unique mix of characters in the movie,with all their quirks.they are really an oddball assortment.i'm not really a baseball fan,but i liked the movie just as a movie,and not so much as a baseball movie.for me,Major League' is a 6/10",6,0,2,22 May 2007
The Dark Knight," for me,it doesn't even touch Batman Begins
","i loved the previous Batman film,Batman Begins.i thought it was brilliant,possibly the best superhero movie ever made.and with stratospheric hype this newest film had,combined with the trailers i had seen,i knew i had to see it.many people commented that it more than lived up to the hype,so i expected something earth shattering.to say i was disappointed is an understatement.there were moments where i was bored,and hoped it would end soon.Batman's voice in this movie annoyed me.it sounded like he had swallowed a bucket of gravel.either that,or had a bad case of laryngitis.maybe there was a reason behind this.but all it did was annoy me.as for Heath Ledger,and his performance as The Joker,i found it OK,but i wouldn't say it was award worthy.i mean no disrespect by this.when the movie finally ended and i left the theatre,neither the the character of The Joker,or any aspect of the movie stayed with me.bottom line,i didn't find anything profound in this movie.i was massively disappointed.it doesn't even touch Batman Begins,in my opinion.for me,The Dark Knight is a 5/10.",5,11,21,4 August 2008
Into the Wild," a bit long at 148 minutes
","this movie is basically about a man who abandons a life of comfort and gives away all his money to go live in the wild.along his journey,he meets some interesting characters and learns things about himself.it's another 'based on a true story' movie.i liked some things about this movie,and didn't like some other things.i liked all the interesting people he met.i like the fact that he had the courage to live like he wanted to,not how society dictated.you might think he was crazy to live like he did,or you might think he embraced life.he did do some dangerous things,that's for sure.i liked the folk music soundtrack,and i thought he voice over narration from Jena Malone(as his sister)very effective.i didn't like the preachiness of the movie.and i also thought at 148 minutes it was too long.it's not what i would call fast paced.i also found it a bit depressing at times.generally though i found it interesting enough.for me,Into The Wild is a 6/10",6,0,3,22 March 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," mind bending
","this is one interesting movie.it's hard to follow,doesn't appear to make sense,and has very limited dialogue.i found the first half fairly slow,but it picks up after that.the space scenes are very spectacular,and very realistic,as in the incomplete stillness of it.there is no sound at all in space,and that is conveyed very well here.the music is simply fantastic.i did say that the movie is hard to follow,and i suspect on subsequent viewing,this would be less so,as for it not making sense,i get the feeling it isn't necessarily supposed to.and the quiet scenes without dialogue are very compelling.there is a real air of mystery around the whole thing,and i did like that aspect.this must have been quite an ambitious undertaking and it shows.i do plan on watching it again soon,to see what i have missed and what i can discover.for me,2001: A Space Odyssey is a 7/10",7,0,5,3 September 2009
Toy Story," definitely a classic
","Toy Story is easily one of the best CG animated movies ever made.it was the first one completely animated by computer.the story is simple but wonderful.the voice acting is terrific.all of the voices fit the characters very well.the film is very fast paced.both kids and adults should enjoy it.it still stands up well after over 15 years.Randy Newman's music takes a bit of getting used to.he has has a distinct voice.but once you get used to it,you can focus on the rest of the film.if you haven't seen the film yet,what are you waiting for?run out and rent it.you won't be sorry.you'll probably end up buying up like i did.for me,Toy Story is an 8/10",8,1,1,22 April 2011
Blood Diamond," fast paced and exciting,but touching and heart breaking
","i really liked this movie.it''s faced paced and exciting.it's also very touching and heartbreaking.it concerns Sierra Leone in 1999 and the bloody civil war, and the illegal,conflict diamond trade by big jewelery companies.the movie contains lots of violence.many innocent people are killed.if you are squeamish about violence,you might wan't to steer away from this one.it is not a documentary,so i'm sure a lot of liberty was taken for dramatic purposes.as far as i know,the part about the civil war and the conflict diamond trade are fairly accurate.Leonardo DiCaprio turns in another great performance.he's turned into quite an actor.as a matter of fact,i liked him better in this movie,than 'The Departed'.Jennifer Connelly is good in her role,although i wish she had been given more to work with.but the real standout in this movie is Djimon Hounsou(The Island,Constantine)as the anguished father looking for his family.i thought his performance was brilliant.i also liked the views of the landscape.overall,a very good movie,though not easy to watch.i give 'Blood Diamond' an 8.5/10",9,1,2,31 March 2007
Men in Black," one of the best sci/fi comedy movies ever made
","this is a very clever and witty movie.it takes a serious subject,such as Alien Invasion and turns it on it's head.there will be a lot of laughter involved in the watching of this movie.at least there should be.the whole premise behind it is absurd,intentionally so.there's a lot of irony in this movie.Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith Play the two main Men in Black character.Jones plays agent K (Kay) and Smith plays Agent J(Jay)K is the straitlaced veteran who reluctantly trains a newcomer,Who takes the nickname or code name K(Smith)Jones and Smith work brilliantly together.Jones as the strait man and Smith as his comic foil.these two have some great comic chemistry.whoever had the idea to pair these two up deserves medal.i don't think they could have found two more perfectly suited actors on the planet.but amid all the hilarity,their is some serious stuff happening,and that is handled very well.even the serious scenes are played for laughs.this is in my top five in comedies.brilliant.",10,0,0,23 May 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," not a horrible movie,but much too methodical for my tastes
","this is a hard movie to review.i mean,it has a unique premise:that it is possible to erase selected memories from your mind,so you can forget any heartache and pain.that's sort of the gist,but things don't actually work out quite that way for the characters involved. aside from the unique premise,i found the movie hard to follow and much to slow and melancholy.it's also much too methodical for my tastes.it seems to dwell too long on certain scenes or situations.the movie is also very bizarre at times.this is no summer popcorn movie.it's definitely deep.too deep for me. i guess it's sort of a lesson that there's just some things you shouldn't mess with as there may be unexpected repercussions. i found the movie on the cusp of being compelling,just enough to keep watching to the end.the acting in the movie is good.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play the two lead characters.the supporting cast is also strong.this movie won't make you feel uplifted,so if you're feeling down,you might want to hold off on this movie.all things considered,the most i can give 'eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a 5/10",5,2,6,3 June 2007
Taken," great action film
","Liam Neeson proves he can play the action hero as well s anyone in this action thriller.he plays the father of a 17year old who has been kidnapped while in Paris.with very little to go on,he races against time to find her kidnappers and save her.oh,and he has a very particular set of skills.in short,they messed with the wrong guy.what follows are some very intense fight scenes,which are very well choreographed.but this is not just an action movie.there are certainly some dramatic moments and the movie is tinged with sadness,as some of the events in the movie mirror reality.of course being a Hollywood movie,you pretty much know how it will end,although it didn't end completely the way i thought it would.all in all, a very entertaining movie,that also makes you think.for me,Taken is an 8/10",8,0,0,22 August 2009
This Is Spinal Tap," this is funny...
","and clever and relevant and probably spot on in regards to how some people in the music and entertainment industry act.i loved the British accents ,and some of the gags are just too funny.the motley mix of characters are also great.the music actually isn't too bad sometimes,though i suspect that's probably unintentional.usually it's dog awful,and very funny which i think it's supposed to be.for a movie that's a quarter century old,you'd think it would feel dated,but i didn't think so at all.a lot of that is probably due to the writing of Christopher Guest and Michael McKean.for me,This is Spinal Tap is a well deserved 9/10",9,0,3,9 November 2009
The Mummy Returns," better than the first one(very high praise)
","if it's possible,this sequel to 'The Mummy'i s even better than the original.it's just as fun and exciting,but i liked the story better.i really liked the way the filmmakers developed the characters and gave them more to do.i also liked the direction the story took.the humour is still there,and Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz return in their original roles.they are a great screen couple.John Hannah also returns in his role as Evie's(Weisz) Brother.the visual effects are just as good,maybe better.the bad guys are more dangerous than in the first outing.again,realism is not of the utmost importance in this movie,nor should it be.if it were,this would be one boring picture.for me,'The Mummy Returns' is a strong 9/10",9,0,0,23 May 2007
Avatar," technically it's brilliant
","this movie blew me away.i'm not sure what i was expecting,but my expectations were more than shattered.i mean,the movie looked great for one thing.it was like a colour bomb had exploded all over the screen.the action is is also fantastic.and i liked the story,even though it isn't original.and really,how many movies these days have an original story?there are some,but they are in the minority.if you are hoping for an original story,you might be disappointed,but from a technical standpoint Avatar gets top marks.anyway,if you plan on seeing it,3D is the only way to go in my mind.otherwise,there's no point.and this is not the gimmicky 3D where they thrust an object at the screen every once in awhile.this is real 3D,which the whole movie is filmed in.after awhile it became so seamless,i actually forgot i was watching 3D.it's not every day an event movie like this comes around.for me,the technical aspect was so good,that i just got caught up in the wonder of it all and the originality of the storyline did not bother me.for that reason,i give Avatar a 10/10",10,1,7,14 February 2010
Toy Story 2," not quite as good as the original
","there's a lot more going on in In TOY Story 2 than in the original film.the action and adventure quotient is upped quite a bit.the original had a very simple story whereas this one has a bit more to it.i think i prefer the first film slightly.the music was better,in m opinion.i found a couple of the songs it a bit too sentimental for my tastes in this film.it's definitely still worthy watching and adding to your collection and it looks great,especially in Blu-ray.if you haven't seen it,i'd encourage you to check it out.i added it to my collection and haven't regretted it for a second.for me,Toy Story 2 is a strong 7/10",7,0,1,22 April 2011
Chariots of Fire," powerful
","Chariots of Fire is an engaging,compelling and touching story.it centres around two men,one a devout Christian,the other Jewish.both are elite runners and both have a fiery competitive spirit.an both hope to compete in the 8th Olympiad.the two have different ways of trying to achieve success.the Christian is shown in a positive life as someone who sticks to his religious convictions at all costs,and relies on faith for his success.his character is not mocked or made fun of,which tends to happen a lot in movies.the Jewish character will do anything to it takes to win.the movie boasts a poignant musical score by Vangelis,which is probably one of the most recognisable scores ever composed.this is not an action movie.it is an engrossing character study,which is well written and well acted.and if you're a Christian,you will be able to appreciate a Christian character shown in a positive light.for me,Chariots of Fire is a 10/10",10,3,4,3 May 2008
Drag Me to Hell," Lorna Raver steals the show
","i liked this Sam Raimi film a lot.there are quite few spooky moments,and i love the atmosphere of dread.there are a lot of jump out of your seat scares,and a lot of eerie sounds.speaking of sounds,there are some very loud moments here,some of which border on repetitiveness.there were also a few campy moments,which to me weren't in keeping with the serious tone of the movie.and there is some really cringe worthy dialogue that had no relevance to the movie.otherwise,this is a great horror flick.Alison Lohman was really good as the lead character.David Paymer is very good in a small role.Justin long was OK,but had almost nothing to do.however there are two real stars of the movie,the first being Lorna Raver as evil incarnate.the second star is the makeup crew for Raver's character.it was nothing short of phenomenal.all tolled, Drag me to Hell is an 8/10",8,1,5,6 June 2009
Invictus," Invictus: unconquer, unconquerable, undefeated
","i won't go into too much detail about this film,because i think any potential viewer should go into into it with no preconceived notions.but,i can say it is one very powerful movie with terrific acting and directing.on he acting front you have the great Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela.and directing the proceedings is master of the craft Clint Eastwood.you can't ask for a better combination than that.Matt Damon also stars,and is very good,but it's Freeman's show.obviously there a political angle to the story.but there's more than that.there's a liberal does of Rugby as well.it's basically a drama/sports/biography(with some dramatic license)and political film.it all adds up to one engrossing,compelling experience.for me,Invictus is an 8/10",8,0,1,5 July 2010
Mission: Impossible," you'll need a map to follow this one
","you know,i think this could have been a good movie.trouble is,you need a scorecard and a code to keep track of who's good and who's bad,what side each person is on etc.it seems that everybody was screwing everybody else over.did i mention it was convoluted?i think you may even need a map for this one.i don't think it's good thing if a movie makes your brain hurt trying to keep up.i know it involved agents and double agents and some kind of evil scheming.Tom cruise was close to the top of his career when this movie was released,but even he doesn't save this one.not even the guy in the red cape and blue underwear could salvage this movie.it's no fun when you brain goes into overdrive all the time. instead of your adrenaline.and this is the sort of movie that should be fun,escapist entertainment.from what i could figure out and the fact there were some thrilling moments,i give 'Mission Impossible' 6/10. too bad,because a more coherent story would have elevated the rating by at least two points.",6,0,2,24 May 2007
Saw," well done horror movie
","the movie saw was well done in every aspect.i liked the opening sequence,which gave you just enough information to keep watching.i especially liked the intimate setting,which focused more on the characters than their surroundings which were very sparse. you are given background information on the characters, which is perfect for this movie.of course it helps that their are only only two main characters.you can't help but be emotionally involved as they wonder what to do next and how or even if they will survive.i liked the gritty look of the film and the lighting was well done.the actors were believable,and even though the victims were not necessarily the most morally upstanding people, they were still sympathetic enough to root for.the villain was very original and creative,the likes of which, as far as i'm aware had not been seen before, or since.i liked the fact that he wasn't your typical psychopath,in that,in his mind he was giving his victims the chance to redeem themselves,cleanse themselves of sin,and gain a new appreciation for the lives they were given.you might say he was merely doing a good deed.he was sort of a philosopher on the human condition.it was refreshing to see a villain who was behind the scenes and not actually perpetrating his crimes directly,like,say,your garden variety maniac.don't get me wrong,he was obviously crazy and had a messianic complex, holding the power of life and death over his victims.he just wasn't your typical crazy.he was actually a multi-dimensional baddie.imagine that.in a nutshell, he wore many hats.man,this movie is deep on so many levels.anyway,there was also quite a bit of blood and gore,but it was necessary for the story.the ending was also good,naturally setting up nicely for the sequel.i know i'm rambling,so i'll wrap it up.basically,saw was a very good movie.i recommend it highly,especially if you're tired of all the the slice'n dice movies with stupid characters that you actually hope get killed. 8*",8,0,1,7 October 2006
The Last Samurai," beautiful,moving,well acted picture
","Tom Cruise is Captain Nathan Algren,who in 1870 is hired by the Emperor of Japan to train the Japanese Army in modern warfare.The Emperor than hopes to bring about an end to the Samurai,who have remained with the old way of fighting.As events unfold,Algren is captured by the Samurai and while treated with indifference and disdain at first,he slowly becomes part of the community.he begins to learn the Samurai ways,and gains their trust and friendship.in turn,he develops a newfound respect for the samurai way,and in time,becomes a better man for it. Even if you are not a Tom Cruise fan,you should still like this movie.Cruise plays Algren as a man who is at first,deeply flawed,with no hope.Then,as the movie progresses,Cruise convincingly portray's Algren's slow,but noticeable change into a humble man who regains his humanity and discovers what it means to be a man.This Movie is directed by Edward Zwick(Glory,Legends of the Fall.The screenplay was written by John Logan(Any Given Sunday,Gladiator).the action scenes are well done and look authentic.the dialogue is well written,leading to some very touching scenes.the movie is also visually stunning. everyone involved put their heart and soul into this project and it shows. 10/10",10,11,23,29 January 2007

","Home Alone 2 has pretty much the same general plot as the first one.a few of the particulars have changed,including the location.this time Kevin is Lost in New York,while his family is somewhere else.the 2 bumbling Robbers,Marv(Daniel Stern)and Harry(Joe Pesci)return and of course meet up with Kevin and slapstick ensues.this movie is a bit longer,and i felt it took a while to get going,but once it does,it's very funny.the booby traps Kevin designs are just as elaborate and cause a lot of pain and grief for Harry and Marv,and a lot of hilarity for the audience.this movie is a bit more touching and heartwarming than the first one,and at least as funny.the only downside for me is the slow beginning.otherwise,it pretty much lives up to the first one.for me,Home Alone 2 Is an 8.5/10",9,3,5,24 November 2008
Up," not quite as good as i had hoped
","this was a fairly enjoyable animated film from Disney/Pixar.there's some funny moments here and there.it's touching without being too maudlin or sentimental.there certainly is a fair amount of action as well.the story is also good.there a few scenes of minor peril which might be a bit too much for younger children,and the movie fleetingly touches upon a sad topic.for the most part,i enjoyed the movie.i did think however,there were a few scenes that were probably intended to be funny,but came across flat and pointless in my mind.all in all,pretty good effort,just not as good as i hoped or thought it would be.for me,Up is 6/10",6,4,8,31 December 2009
The Fly," pretty good,but disgusting
","i thought this movie was quite well done,very atmospheric and creepy.Jeff Goldblum plays,Seth Brundle,A quiet,introverted scientist who spends most of his time alone working on his new project.Geena Davis plays Journalist Veronica Quaife,a journalist who Seth invites to his place to show her what he is working on.up to this point,Seth's experiments(teleportation) have been successful with inanimate objects,and not so successful with living creatures.Seth thinks he has worked out the bugs and tries the experiment on himself.the experiment goes horribly wrong.Seth begins to change from being mild mannered and shy to something else.Jeff Goldblum is terrific in showing the gradual mental deterioration of the scientist as he slowly becomes almost messianic,then terrified at the physical changes happening to him.the actual physical transformation that Seth undergoes is startling,but the final transformation is something else entirely and somewhat disgusting.but well done,considering the movie is over 20 years old.Geena Davis is good in her Portryal of a woman at 1st fascinated and then terrified by what has happened.the best part of this movie is the musical score by Howard Shore,which is very moody and eerie.Nile Rodgers also contributes a nice pie of music to the film with the original song 'Help Me'.i'd have to give 'The Fly' 8/10",8,0,1,24 February 2007
Invincible," a feel good family movie
","i liked this movie for the most part.it's based on the life of a 30 year old Philadelphia bartender who gets a shot a playing for the NFL's Philadelphia eagles.he has no college experience and only played one year of high school football.but his friends convince him to attend the open tryout held by the team.no one gives him a chance to even make training camp.i'm sure the filmmakers took some liberty with the movie for dramatic purposes,so how accurate the film is,i don't really know.i do know it is entertaining,with good acting performances.Mark Wahlberg plays VInce Papale,the character the movie is based on.he does a fine job,but i really liked Elizabeth Banks in a supporting role as the love interest.i thought she was fantastic.the only knock i would give this movie is that it gets a bit too sentimental at times,with that sweeping,emotional instrumental music.but then,this is a Disney movie,and from my experience they're sort of known for that.however aside from a bit of mild language and some football violence,this is a good family movie.i give 'Invincible' an 8/10",8,0,0,11 July 2007
Groundhog Day," a bitter man find himself relieving the same day over and over again until he gets it right
","this movie never loses it's charm and effect,even after repeated viewing.it's the story of a bitter,lonely arrogant,empty man (Bill Murray) who find himself reliving the same day(Groundhog Day) over and over again.each time he goes through he begins a slow transformation until he learns what life really means.he becomes a better man for the experience.Andie MacDowell plays the love interest and Chris Elliott put in a good supporting performance. also has this movie is at it's heart a life lesson movie,a morality fable,if you will.many of these types of movie are maudlin and inspirational ad naseum.not this one.it manages to avoid going down that route.i think this is due to the strong writing and direction.Danny Rubin wrote the story,and he and Harold Ramis co wrote the screen play.Ramis also directed the film.what's also good about this film are it's light comedic touches and even some flat out hilarious moments",9,0,2,25 May 2007
National Treasure," very enjoyable,thrilling, action flick
","National Treaure is the story of Bejamin Gates(Nicholas Cage) who has been obsessed with finding the mythical(but perhaps real) treasure of the Knights Templar,the greatest fortune mankind has ever known,since he was a child.Along the way,Gates makes an enemy(Sean bean)who also wants the treasure for himself(for purely selfish reasons).in a twist,it turns out that Gates must steal The Declaration Of Independence,(which contains a key clue to the Mystery)so it does not fall into enemy hands.along for the ride are Diane Kruger,Harvey Keitel,and John Voight.Christopher plummer also appears in the movie.what follows is one intense chase scene after chase in a race against time.National Treasure is basically one long chase movie,but well done.the acting is good,and the characters are convincing.the movie is very enjoyable--even thrilling, as long as you know what you are expecting.very few dramatic scenes,little character development(except for the character of Benjamin)and much of the movie is implausible,even unrealistic, but so what.sometimes you just have to turn your brain off and enjoy. 8/10",8,0,3,15 January 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Tarentino's directorial/writer debut
","i was pleasantly surprised by this feature film debut of Quentin Tarantino as writer/director.i had heard all the hype of how great it was over the years and was sure i would be disappointed.as it turns out,it was a pretty good film.great dialogue.memorable characters.smooth transitions from one scenes to another.the story was interesting.there's some violence,but bot at all at the level i was expecting.in fact,i had seen a lot worse before than and even directly after,while watching True Romance,coincidentally also written by Tarantino.True romance is much more blood soaked than Reservoir Dogs.however,there is some some very strong language.in conclusion,while i certainly wasn't disappointed in Reservoir Dogs,i wouldn't say it's a great movie.for me,Reservoir Dogs is a 7/10",7,0,0,27 March 2010
Total Recall," another classic Arnie film
","wow.i loved this classic Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.it's funny,fast paced.has some great lines,including some one liners from Arnie.it's also outrageously funny and over the top.It's based on a short story by Philip K.Dick,and it's one of the better screen adaptations of a Dick story.Paul Verhoeven(Hollow Man,Starship Troopers,Basic Instinct)directed it,while Ronald Shusset,who wrote the screen story for Alien,also wrote the screenplay and screen story for this movie.there is some brief nudity, some violence and a bit of language.compared to other Arnie films,though,the amount of coarse language is very low.for me,this movie is a thrill ride.my vote for Total Recall is a 9/10",9,0,2,21 March 2008
Rocky," classic underdog story
","Rocky is by now considered a classic movie,and well it should be.if you like underdog stories,you will love this movie.i won'y go to much into the plot,except to say this is a story of an unknown boxer who hits the big time when he gets the chance the fight the current world champion.Sylvester Stallone wrote the script and starred as rocky.the underdog theme in the movie mirror Stallone's life somewhat,as he was down and out prior to the film.Stallone shot to stardom after Rocky,becoming a household name.anyway,as for the movie itself,the story is well developed and the characters are well written.the dramatic moments are well done as are the action scenes.the movie is very inspiring,but stops short of being maudlin.you really care about Rocky and want him to succeed.more than a movie,Rocky has become a part of pop culture and will likely remain so for a long time to come.a strong 9/10",9,1,2,29 January 2007
Don't Breathe," claustrophobic suspense thriller
","this is one nifty little suspense thriller.once it gets going,it grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the end credits.i don't want to give away the plot,but lets just say that just because someone seems helpless,doesn't mean they are,as our three main characters find out when they break into a house to steal any thing of value.problem is,they picked the wrong house to rob.the owner of the house is blind but far from helpless.so our trio get much more than they bargained for.Stephen Lang plays the blind man and is pitch perfect here.the other here main actors are good,but Stephen Lang steals the show in my opinion.for me,Don/t breathe is a 9/10.",9,18,39,5 September 2016
The Descent," pure adrenaline rush (and frickin scary too)
","my buddy and i recently watched neil marshal's 'the descent'and i have to say we were impressed.unlike many horror movies, this one actually had good character development, crucial if you want the audience to have a vested interest in the characters and their fate.and the scenes in the cave are quite well done, showing the fear and panic of the characters.you really feel for them since you've had a chance to get to know them.once the action gets going, it grabs you by the throat and won't let go.we barely had time catch our breath before another intense action/horror sequence would bombard us.the tension at times was palpable,and once the creatures are revealed,they are truly terrifying indeed and you never know when or where they will show up.my friend and i both jumped several times throughout and it wasn't until the movie ended that we were able to take some deep breaths and sigh in relief, as our minds and bodies had been in overdrive.i thought the ending was good and unpredictable,which is rare these days.even after the movie ended it took awhile for us both to wind down from the adrenaline rush.this is a movie you might not be able to get through alone, so you are better of watching it with someone.be prepared for an adrenaline fueled thrill ride along with some genuine terror. you have been warned",10,4,9,30 September 2006
The Da Vinci Code," underwhelming
","after watching this movie,i have one overriding feeling.that of being underwhelmed.there was lot of hype for this movie,but it just didn't live up to it for me.it should have been better.i mean,it had good actors and a decent story.and the dialogue was OK.but.for whatever reason,it just didn't resonate with me.i guess the biggest reason is that i found it slow and boring.i found the end way too protracted fro my tastes.i also believe they could have shaved 30 minutes off of it.i also think Tom Hanks's character was too low key In this movie.for another 'quest 'movie,i would recommend National Treasure.it's not as deep,but i felt it was much more fun and action packed.but that's just my opinion.for me,The Da Vinci Code is a 5/10.",5,1,4,29 October 2007
Rocky III," 2nd sequel in Rocky series
","Rocky 3 is not a bad movie,as far as the series goes.it has lots of action,some good training sequences and some dramatic moments.however it lacks something that the first 2 have.and that is heart.it just doesn't have the depth of that they have.this is not a tangible thing,but more a feeling.if you watch Rocky 3,you will understand.the antagonist,(villain)Clubber Lang,Rocky's rival,is fairly strong as portrayed by Mr.T.though i get the sense this movie was made just to keep the franchise going.I say this because if you watch the next installment,Rocky 4,you will notice there is more intent to the whole movie.The antagonist is much more developed and there is more at stake.there are actually 2 antagonists and you will understand if you watch the movie.anyway, back to 3.the filmmakers could have done without this installment and went right to 4.as for Rocky 3-- 7 stars/10",7,4,5,2 February 2007
The Happening," i don't feel it deserves all its negative criticism (7.5/10)
","i really don't understand all the negative reviews and criticisms of this film.i thought it was very well done.it's very intense and suspenseful,and and very creepy.it builds up suspense from opening scene,and doesn't really let up.i thought the story was creative,and the reason for the events could be possible,even though it seems far fetched.i did however,think the characters were nothing more than plot devices,and almost caricatures.none of theme were really developed,and there isn't really much in the way of acting going on.but despite that,i liked the film,mainly because of the high suspense factor,which i feel overrides the negative aspects of the film.for me,The Happening is a 7.5/10",8,3,10,21 December 2008
The Godfather: Part III," fine conclusion to the saga
","in my mind the final installment in the Godfather series is as good as the previous two,yet most people don't seem to think so.i think the story is great.this is a more subtle movie,and more cerebral than the other two.it's very well written,in my opinion.AL Pacino Is back as Michael Corleone,and is great once again,but Andy Garcia is outstanding as Vincent,as is Sofia Coppola as Mary Corleone.it was made sixteen years after part two,so it probably wasn't originally intended as part of the series,(which is probably why many purists don't like it)but i'm glad it was made .i think it's a fitting end to the saga.for the purists that won't watch on principle,it's their loss.for me,The Godfather: Part III is a 10/10",10,1,2,11 April 2010
The Matrix Reloaded," random and incoherent
","this is the second movie in the Matrix saga.it chronicles the continuing fight of the resistance to free humanity from continuing enslavement from the machines which keep reality hidden from them.this is not what i would call good movie.it is a collection of repetitive and ridiculous unrealistic fight scenes,coupled with an incoherent storyline.plus there a lot of 'profound' sayings which aren't really profound at all.then you have characters speaking in riddles which are gibberish half the time.at time,i felt i was being preached a philosophy lesson.the rating for this movie is pretty high on this site(7/10)which astounds me.in my opinion,that is at least three stars too many.My vote for The Matrix Reloaded is a 4/10",4,9,15,22 February 2008
Enemy at the Gates," way too depressing
","Enemy at the Gates is set during ww2 during the Battle for Stallingrad.It is the story of a young Russian sharpshooter named Vassili and his battle with A German sniper known as Konig sent to assassinate him .Jude Law plays Vassilli,while Ed Harris plays the German sniper,Konig.Vassilli is quickly coming to fame for the amount of Germans he has shot and killed,which is leading to low morale of the German troops.So,Konig has been sent to kill Vassili and raise the moral of the German troops.there is more going on here but this is the main thrust of the story.The movie is exceptionally bleak in every aspect and is very hard to watch.there is an air of depression throughout the movie.i will definitely not watch this movie again. 2/10",2,0,2,9 January 2007
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," high octane action,with comedy and romance(what a blast!)
","wow,talk about a great movie.action,comedy romance,brilliant dialogue,you name it.add to that the perfect choice of casting brad Pitt and Andelina Jolie in the lead roles.the basic premise of the story is that Jane (Angelina Jolie) and John Smith(Brad Pitt)are a husband and wife who have become bored with their marriage.what the they don't know is that each is a top assassin.and each has been contracted to kill the other.all i can day is is if you're looking for high octane action,comedy,romance,look no further.the chemistry between Jolie and Pitt is so palpable it crackles.the action scenes will leave you breathless,the witty dialogue is brilliant.Vince Vaughn plays Eddie,friend to john and is hysterical in the comic relief dept.it should come as no surprise that this a well crafted film,considering it is directed by Doug(The Bourne Identity)Liman,another great action picture.The great writing comes courtesy of Simon Kinburg,who also wrote X-men-the Last stand.as for 'Mr and Mrs Smith' a perfect 10/10",10,2,7,17 February 2007
The Departed," If Scorsese keeps this up,i might end up being a fan
","The Departed is a searing crime opus directed masterfully by Martin Scorsese.this film blew me away.I'm not generally a Scorsese fan,but give the man credit.when he wants to,he can put on a directing clinic.the film is populated with great actors inhabiting the roles of memorable characters,both good and bad and some who are both or neither.add in to the mix intense action,double crosses and betrayal and you have one powder keg of a movie.the movie is not told in a linear fashion,(in other words,it is not straight forward)yet never strays towards convolution or hard to follow territory.the movie is ultra violently graphic and is very liberal in its use of profanity,which makes it more authentically real.there is a gritty,almost unwashed feeling to the movie,another positive.the acting is second to none,with a brilliant ensemble cast big name A-listers and some lesser known,though equally brilliant actors/actresses.the writers must also be given credit.the dialogue is crisp,smooth and intelligent.The Depatrted is stylistic,but with substance.it will leave a lasting impact.",10,0,4,6 January 2007
Glory Road," less preachy and schmaltzy than most Disney movie in the 'based on a true story'genre
","this is a Disney movie 'based on real events',which means the events and the characters are real,but there was probably a lot of dramatic license taken to make it more interesting for audiences.although a lot of times i find Disney movies of the 'based on a true story' genre overly schmaltzy and preachy,i didn't find that here.it is an a inspirational story,don't get me wrong.but it's more restrained than usual.this is really,odd,since it is a Jerry Bruckheimer production.i liked the movie,for the most part.i found the dramatic moments more interesting and entertaining than the basketball sequences.most of those i found underwhelming,except for the last one.of course,the movie is predictable.it is after all an underdog story,so i wouldn't fault anyone for that.the acting is good for the most part.the only thing i would say in the regard is that Josh Lucas,although good in his role as the basketball coach,doesn't always come across as having as much passion as his character should have.that could just be me though. i also didn't that this movie was quite as exciting as other movies of the genre.these are just minor issues though.it's still a good movie,though. for me,'Glory Road' is a 7/10",7,0,0,2 August 2007
Die Hard," Yippee Ki Yay

Psycho," the story is simple but the movie is very effective
","i think i had seen this ,movie,once,along time ago,or at least parts of it.but i had forgotten how good it is.naturally,the most talked about aspect of the movie is the infamous shower scene,so the suspense in waiting for that moment is something else.but the movie is great for other reasons.for one thing,the acting is superb,especially by Anthony Perkins,as Norman Bates.i also was struck by how good the dialogue is.the story is simple enough,yet very effective.this is widely considered Alfred Hitchcock's greatest achievement.Bernard Hermann's score is brilliant.the movie is done in black and wide,which i think makes it more effective than if it had been done in colour.all in all,an outstanding piece of work.for me,Psycho is a very strong 9/10",9,0,1,11 October 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," a more complete movie than the first
","while i gave the first movie a 10/10 for sheer entertainment,this sequel is actually a more complete film,in my opinion,as much as this type of movie can be.for one thing,the story is actually much more interesting and more developed.the humour quotient is upped in this one as well.there are quite a few chuckles.some of the transformers are really neat,especially on the Decepticon side.the fight scenes between the Transformers are quite spectacular,though that isn't surprising.what is surprising is that the transformation scenes(when the vehicles change into their robot forms and vice versa were not seamless,and looked herky jerky to me.in the original film,this was not an issue.still,it's immensely entertaining.and despite a few minor issue.a better movie overall.as an aside,the movie is nominated for a Razzie Award for worst movie,which mystifies me.it's nowhere near Razzie calibre.oh,well.for me,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a 10/10",10,26,48,6 March 2010
Rosemary's Baby," a very disappointing film from Polanski
","this movie sure was a downer.i did not find it scary,or even suspenseful.it was overly long,with very little of consequence occurring.the basic plot is that rosemary and guy woodhouse decide to have a baby.during the pregnancy,people begin behaving strangely (allegedly),including her husband.guy,a struggling actor of no consequence,starts to become more successful suddenly.you see it seems guy has made a deal with the devil to achieve success,but at a price. the bargain guy makes involves Rosemary's Baby.unfortunately for the viewer,we see very little of people acting strangely.there are very little indications of this in the movie.i watched to the end,hoping there would be a pay off that would have made it worth watching and explain some things.maybe tie up some loose ends.there is a scene toward the end,involving a group of people,which instead of having an impact,was laughable,with pathetic acting.the ending was anti climatic,but then so was the entire movie.there was actually a pay off,and that was end credits finally rolling.i can't tell you how disappointed i was with this effort.this movie came out in 1968 and i thought it might have been in the same vein as The Omen,which came out 8 years later.however,this movie is not even close to being in the same league as The Omen.i'm pretty sure i'm in the minority with my opinion,but that's just how i felt about the movie.i guess it was just too sublime for my tastes.anyway,for me,Rosemary's Baby is a 2/10",2,8,26,20 October 2006
War of the Worlds," focuses more on the human element
","when i first saw this film in the theatres,i was not too impressed.the movie didn't have much of an impact.however,upon watching on DVD recently i have a different impression.i really liked it this time around.there are some terrifying scenes,which gave me goose bumps.I recently reviewed another movie with Tom Cruise,where i said that although he has screen presence,i didn't think he is a good actor.i may have to adjust my opinion on that subject,at least as far as this movie is concerned.in this movie Cruise plays the everyman,and does a very good job of it.he had me convinced.Dakota Fanning so far,seems to be quite talented,but she annoyed me little in this movie.i found her too whiny at times.Tim Robbins has what amounts to little more than a cameo,and was just used as a plot device.as for the movie,the effects were very good.there was CG used,but it's pretty seamless.the aliens were very well done.this movie is more character driven,then effects and noise.i put this movie way above 'Independence Day' in terms of the alien Invasion genre.but then,that movie focused on special effects and spectacle more than anything else.for me 'War of the Worlds is an 8/10",8,4,8,29 May 2007
30 Days of Night," well,it sure felt like 30 days
","what a bore.this thing just plods along.it's slow slow,two snails circled the block before it was half over.the few action scenes are just way too frenetic and chaotic.plus,the movie doesn't really bring anything new to the table.the vampires are disgusting,and there are copious amounts of ketchup used for the gore moments.plus,the endless screeching sound they made drove me around the bend.i think i would prefer War and peace,the unabridged version than to have to sit through this again.what a pity.i actually had higher expectations for this one.the one positive is that the acting is good,even from Josh Hairnet.but it's not enough to save this clunker.4/10",4,1,5,24 July 2009

Ice Age," animated hi-jinx and adventure during(what else)the ice age
","if you have a pulse and can fog up a mirror,you should like this movie.it an animated(in 3d)movie that takes place during the ice age.it's a comedy,action,adventure flick that is very fast paced,and a lot of fun for both kids and adults.there are quite a few good laughs in this movie.the voice casting is brilliant.Ray Ramano,Legiuzama,and Dennis Leary,among others provide the voice work.this one of the funnier animated movies in along time.it is rated g,so the whole family can enjoy it.as far as i can tell,there is nothing which should be offensive or unsuitable for children.my advice,gather the family around,pop in the DVD and enjoy. 8/10",8,0,0,20 February 2007
To Kill a Mockingbird," classic with Gregory Peck
","this is an outstanding film.it deals with the subject of hate and ignorance,and basically tells us we should all treat each other with respect and caring.the dialogue is very well written and the characters are all interesting.Gregory Peck gives a brilliant understated performance as a humble small town lawyer who tries to teach his children the same morals and values he has.he ends up taking a very unpopular court case,and his resolve is tested.the movie has a voice over narration by the adult version of one of the children,and i found it very effective.not everyone will like,this movie.it movies a a sedate pace,and some will find that boring.but if you do watch it to the end,you will probably be moved by it.i know i was.my vote for To Kill A Mockingbird is a 10/10",10,1,2,2 May 2008
A Hard Day's Night," simply brilliant

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," there's a reason why it's #8 on the top 250
","i'm glad i finally got around to this film.it's currently ranked #8 in the top 250 here.i can see why.it's certainly an experience watching it.it's a very deep film,with a lot going on.it's very powerful,yet subtle.it's touching at times,sad at others times,and tragic at times.it's been referenced many times in movies TV shows,and more.it and it's legendary performances have become a part of pop culture.the acting is stellar.jack Nicholson won the academy award for his performance,and i'd say deservedly so.Louise Fletcher also won for her performance.she is mesmerizing.there are other great performances as well.i didn't recognize him for a while,but Danny Devito put in a great performance.there's also Christopher Lloyd in his first feature film.i also really liked the performance of Will Sampson.Brad Dourif in his his first credited film also really impressed me,as did Sydney Lassic.there are many other great performances here,too numerous to mention.the point is,i really like the film.beside the acting,it was also very well written,very clever.as it ended,i realized i was really moved by it all.some people might think this movie is overrated,and to each their own.but,if you haven't seen it yet,i recommend you watch with an open mind and draw your own conclusions.and don't let the running time of 133 minutes discourage you.it will(unfortunately)be over before you know it.for me,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is 10/10",10,2,4,11 April 2009
Army of Darkness," final chapter in the Evil Dead Trilogy but works as as a stand alone movie
","this third movie in the Evil Dead franchise is superior two the two previous movies,especially the second one,which was a pile of dreck in my opinion.this one though is very funny,and clever.it's lighter in tone.the story is much better.there are some very witty one liners.it's hard to believe this is part of the Evil dead franchise.but even if you're not familiar with the series you can still enjoy this particular film,as it works well as a stand alone movie.either way,it's a lot of fun.the only complaint i have is the length.at under 80 minutes,i found it a bit short.i think it could have been a bit longer.that's a minor issue.otherwise,i'd highly recommend it.for me,Army of Darkness is a 7/10",7,3,4,9 May 2010

","Scream 2 is just as good as Scream,in my opinion.it's more thrilling and suspenseful.and i think maybe a bit more entertaining overall.it's just as clever as the original.i think it's also better paced than the original.just like the original,,you're left guessing to the end as to the identity of the killer,as there as are so many suspects.there's a bit of character development too so you actually care about the characters.this one ups the ant a bit in the gore department.if you liked the first movie,you should definitely like Scream 2.as sequels go,it ranks right up there,proving that sometimes the second film in a series can be as good as the first or better.for me,Scream 2is a 9/10",9,0,1,11 May 2011
Bram Stoker's Dracula," colourful and stylish adaptation
","i really enjoyed this movie.it is beautifully photographed,with great camera work.i'm not sure how accurate it is to Bram Stoker's novel,but it is very different from the 1931 film. i thought the acting was good,all around,but in Particular, Anthony Hopkinswas brilliant in his portrayal of Abraham Van Helsing,bring some comic relief to the movie.and Of course Gary Oldman was outstanding as the count in his various ages.this is a very eerie movie,though not terrifying.there are a couple of very disturbing scenes.the movie is more style than substance,with great use of colours and is has a very dark pallor over it,which is expected.i was really entertained by it. 8/10",8,1,2,24 February 2007
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson team up
","of the first three Die Hard movies,i liked this,the third one,the least.i think manly because there wasn't very much action,but i also didn't like the story.i just thought there was too much going on.plus,i found the movie too long.it wasn't any longer than the first two movies,but i didn't feel the pacing was very good.plus,this movie doesn't really do a lot to distinguish itself from other movies of the genre.i did like Sam Jackson is his role as a shopkeeper who ends up helping John McClane.i thought he was funny and a good fit for Bruce Willis.i also thought Jeremy Irons was good as the man villain.Graham Greene is good too,in his role as a cop.This movie is missing Bonnie Bedelia,who played McClane's wife in the firs two movies.even though she didn't have that big a role in the other two films,i thought she was great with what she had.anyway,this isn't a bad movie by any means,but it's just not as good as number two,and nowhere near as good as the first one.for me Die Hard:With a Vengeance is a 6/10",6,0,0,16 February 2008
Con Air," great action,decent story,and comic relief from the master(Steve Buscemi)
","this is another action packed thrill ride,though i didn't like it as much as 'The Rock' another action adventure thrill ride which came out the year previous.Nic Cage stars in both of these movies,though in 'Con Air',Cage is the main focus,whereas 'The Rock' was an ensemble cast.any way,in this movie(Con Air)Cage is the lead star and the the main action hero,though he does have some help.the action scenes in this movie are great,though not always believable.there is also a semblance of a story which we are told near the beginning of the film.this sets up the action nicely.there are some big names in this movie,including John Cusack ,John Malkovich, Ving Rames, and Colm Meany.Danny Trejo puts in a very good performance,as well.but it's Steve Buscemi who provides the comic relief,in his usual wry, sardonic way.but,like i said,it's Nic Cage that takes centre stage as the action hero,and he is very credible in my opinion.before i forget,i must mention that the movie also has some dramatic moments which work good.i also like the soundtrack.i thought it suited the movie very well.overall,i liked this movie lot and would recommend it for action fans.i give 'Con Air' 8.5/10",9,10,17,4 June 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," i'd rather have my sinuses scraped
","This movie is pathetic.every drama i've ever seen is funnier than this 'alleged'' comedy.even the anti piracy warning before the movie,is funnier.i'd give an overview of the plot,but it's just too painful.right after the movie,i booked myself for a sinus scraping,followed directly after by a 4 day insurance seminar.i had an ear to ear grin through both the scraping and the insurance seminar.they were both much more entertaining than Anchorman.i know some people thought this movie was funny,but i can't help but wonder if they were either paid,or were somehow involved with the making of the movie.there's no other rational explanation.i didn't find the movie offensive in any way,it was just horribly,depressingly boring.maybe if i had gouged out my eyeballs while watching it,i would have been more entertained.if you like your comedies with no comedy involved,this one's for you.otherwise,try Harold and Kumar go to White Castle,or Repli-Kate, two insanely hysterical comedies.there is no rating low enough for this dreck.",1,11,23,4 January 2007
The Green Mile," a mystical,supernatural journey seen through he eyes of one man
","we have here another rare case of a Stephen King novel which translates well to the big screen.i really enjoyed this story.it's has elements of both the supernatural and the mystical.or maybe those two elements are both the same.either way,this is a well written movie,with well written characters.it's very dramatic and quite long,but that's no criticism of this movie at all.quite the contrary.the movie flows very well and is almost over before you know it.you will want to watch this one more than once.the green mile refers to the long walk from the jail cell to the execution chamber in one particular prison.the movie takes us on a journey of many years as seen and told by one prison warden in particular named Paul Edgecomb and played by Tom Hanks.Edgecomb's life will eventually be transformed by an encounter with one very special man,who end up a prisoner.this is where the supernatural and mystical aspects come in.i'll leave it at that.fro me,'The Green Mile' is a 10/10",10,0,2,30 May 2007
Jaws," did for swimming what psycho did for showering
","this is the movie that ushered in a whole new era for movies.the original shark movie.the movie quickly became part of pop culture history,and has pop culture history and has inspired(and i use that term loosely,for the most part)many pale imitations and pretenders.but no one has had anywhere near the impact 'Jaws' had and continues to have.this movie did for swimming in the ocean what psycho did for showering.the movie has an OK story,but that is not the focal point of this movie.what drives this movie is the suspense and,at times almost unbearable tension.and that's coming from someone who had seen the movie at least once before,so i knew what to expect.the main reason for this is the the musical score by the great John Williams.his theme for Jaws may be the best ever written and performed,and also the most famous.the only other contender in this category is 'Star Wars',much of which Williams is also famous for.i also like the colourful characters,especially the three main ones.we have Roy Scheider as the fairly new police chief(Martin Brody)of the small coastal village called Amity,who has no idea what he is in for.next we have have Robert Shaw as Quint,a crusty sailor/slash would be shark killer,for a fee,of course.and then we have Richard Dreyfuss,as the the upstart scientist(Matt Hooper) specializing in fish called in by Brody for assistance.i am not going to say anything more about the plot.i can only find one problem with this film,and you will probably figure it out when you watch the movie.if you haven't seen this movie,you owe it to yourself,and then you can decide whether it is worthy of all it's praise and lives up to it's reputation.keep in mind,'Jaws' was released in 1975.what is undeniable is that this movie revolutionized film-making for years.for me the movie 'Jaws' is a strong 9/10,only because of the one flaw.",9,1,4,2 May 2007
Hancock," 'i've lived for a very long time...and the one thing i learned...fate doesn't decide everything.people get to choose'.
","this comment refers to the unrated version. i think this move was better than i expected,and different.Will Smith plays the title character,a boozy,rude semi bum,who just happens to be be a super hero and who only reluctantly helps people and usually end up doing a lot of damage in the process.he's pretty much hated by everyone.that's basically the beginning premise of the movie.you can probably predict what happens from there,but you might not predict how it gets to that point.there's a very surprising twist,that i wouldn't have seen coming 100 miles away.i felt there was some depth to the story and to Hancock,as well as some other characters.there are some really touching moments,as well.the tone is not exactly lite,but not quite dark,either.it's somewhere in the middle and sometimes a bit of both.it's not epic or anything,but i found it enjoyable.for me,Hancock is a 7/10",7,1,2,6 December 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," chapter 3
","of the 3 prequels,this one is the best.Anakin is now a young man,very close to the dark side.helping him to get there is supreme chancellor Palpatine(Ian Mcdiarmid)a dark lord of the sith.Mcdiarmid clearly relishes his role as he brings an intensity and believability that must be seen to be believed.this is an Oscar worthy performance.the movie does a fairly good job of tying things up,as the saga concludes.there are,a few problems with the time line,of course,but despite that,the movie works.what everybody was waiting for was the reveal of Anakin into Darth Varder,and those chilling words:'Rise Lord Vader'(Palpatine)'Yes My Master'(voice of Darth Vader)so was the last scene worth the wait?for the most part yes.it treads close to being funny,but stops just short.as for the movie itself,the best of the prequels,and closer in quality to the original trilogy. 8/10",8,2,4,22 February 2007
Ray," A biopic on the great Ray Charles which does not realize its full potential
","i can't say Ray is a bad movie,because it certainly isn't.however,it could have been better.Jamie Foxx is very good in the title role.the problem however lies with the film itself.Ray gets high marks for style,but not so much for substance.it just doesn't have the depth,the heart and soul it should have.this movie also tends to be depressing at times and seems to drag.Ray Charles was a genius and that is shown very effectively in the movie.he was also shown to be a less than nice human,to be polite.the filmmakers were striving for accuracy and i get that.but sometimes the film focuses too much on this aspect of Charles and this is where it languishes.Ray could have been a great film.instead it sits somewhere between good and very good.A disappointment considering the subject matter.",6,0,3,29 December 2006
Shooter," high octane action,suspense and intrigue
","this is a great movie.the action is through the roof.Mark Wahlberg is fantastic in the title role.you won't be bored for a minute with this film.but it's not just action.there's also some intrigue and suspense.Antoine Fuqua(Training Day)directed this movie and Jonathon Lemkin wrote the screenplay.he also wrote the story for Lethal Weapon 4.the movie is based on novel By Stephen Hunter called Point of Impact.anyway,this movie is entertaining from the get go.there is some graphic violence and coarse language,so if that's not your thing,you might want avoid this movie.anyway,in my opinion,this movie is entertaining from the get go.for me,Shooter is a 9/10",9,1,4,25 November 2007
The Lion King," brilliant Disney animated film
","this Disney film was probably the most ambitious undertaking by the studio up to that time.the amount of animated sequences are astounding and the detail equally so.so from a technical stand point it's brilliant.and the content of the movie is great as well.the story is wonderful.and unlike many earlier Disney animated movies movies,the villain in this movie is much less evil,and the movie is suitable for most ages.there are a few intense scenes though,and a scene dealing with ***possible minor spoiler***the loss(death)of a character.other than that,though,it should OK for anyone.there are also a fair amount of catchy songs that kids will like,and even the adults might like.for me,The Lion King is a 10/10",10,5,5,9 May 2009
Inception," a victim of the over hype machine
","i might be in the minority here but i was not blown away by this film.don't get me wrong.i enjoyed,ans it's well made,and has an interesting concept(the art of stealing a person's secrets from their subconscious while they are dreaming.but to me,it didn't(or couldn't) live up to the hype.it has its good point.it isn't boring and the acting is first rate,especially by Leonardo DiCaprio.i liked the look of the film too.many people i know have said it was so complex that they had to watch it more than once to understand it.i don't agree.i didn't find it complex at all.think it's well worth watching,but like i said,It just had too much hype to live up to.but that's just me opinion.for me,Inception is a 7/10",7,5,9,27 March 2011
Lord of War," Interpol agent pursues arms dealer
","Lord of war is a very effective movie.it is well written,there is a decent back story to the main character via numerous flash backs.Nicolas Cage plays an arms dealer being pursued relentlessly by an interpol agent.(Ethan Hawke)I liked the first person narrative with Cage doing the voice-over.it worked well with this picture.a friend of mine complained that it was too preachy,telling us of the evil of guns and showing the deaths of many people particularly young people,to hammer home the point.However i chose to see it as a piece of entertainment,looking beyond what the agenda might have been.if we always look for a hidden agenda in a movie,then we rob ourselves of the experience and we limit ourselves to certain movies and lose out on other perhaps great films.Of course independent of all this we hope the movie is well made and has some entertainment value.Lord of War is one of those movies.it is immensely entertaining,with good performances.i love this movie. 10/10",10,3,5,3 November 2006

The Terminal," a very heartwarming comedy/drama
","the terminal is a terrific film,with just the right mix of humour and drama.terrific acting all around and superbly directed by steven spielberg,clearly demonstrating he has a gift for lighter fare as well as his brilliance for darker material.the movie is essentially about a man from a foreign country, who through no fault of this own, is forced to live in one of the airports in new york.the movie then details his struggle to survive in a foreign environment and to learn the language.i loved the look of the film.it was well lit,giving it a bright, sort of open mood.the sets were very authentic looking.obviously all involved put a tremendous effort into the making of this project and it shows.tom hanks is perfectly cast as the lead,as is catherine zeta jones as the romantic interest,which says a lot about her talent as an actress, because i have never been a fan of hers.a lot of credit has to go to the writers,who crafted the wonderful dialogue.i really invested a lot emotionally in the the characters especially the two leads and that investment more than pays off.you can feel the chemistry crackle between them stanley tucci was also exceptional in his supporting role.this is truly a wonderful movie;heartwarming and inspirational without going overboard.in the hands of a less skilled director,the terminal could have been a lesser movie.but, in the hands of the master,this film is exceptional . 8.5* out of 10",9,2,4,13 October 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," moving and emotionally impactful(if you liked 'The Green Mile' you will like this movie)
","like 'The Shawshank Redemption,'The Green Mile' is another case of a Stephen King story which translates well from the page to the screen.as in 'Mile',this movie is also directed by Frank Darabont,who also wrote the screenplay.another similarity is the prison setting and the fact that the movie is seen and told through the eyes of one man (Morgan Freeman)who just happens to be a prison lifer and the things he sees as the years go by.he tells the story of one man who becomes a prisoner(TIm Robbins) and who he becomes friends with.the movie then chronicles their friendship and struggles in the prison system.unlike 'The Green Mile',there is no mystical or supernatural element to this film.however,this film is of the same calibre of 'Mile',owing to its solid writing, acting, and direction.'Shawshank' is very dramatic,yet very compelling.it's also a very moving tale.it will likely impact you emotionally and intellectually. and before i forget,i must also mention the ending,which i thought was very strong.for me,'The Shawshank Redemption' is a strong 10/10",10,2,3,30 May 2007

Halloween," i remembered it being better than this (6.5/10)
","this movie is considered classic,and i can kinda see why.i guess it was the first movie to tap into peoples fear of the bogeyman and put it to screen in a horror film.it also has that great musical score by John Carpenter.i have seen it a few times,most recently last night.this time i was not as impressed as i remember being before.but then again i'd also just seen Rob Zombie's 2007 version.as for this movie,i found it quite slow at times.and the acting is not the greatest.the movie had a low budget,but that didn't really bother me.i think the filmmakers did a good job with the budget they had.it certainly could have looked a lot worse.there are also a few logic gaps,which i only noticed when things got slow.it gave me a chance to think about things in the movie.i didn't find it scary, or even suspenseful,but i can see how it might have been scary back in the day.for me,Halloween(1978 version)is a 6.5/10.",7,1,2,6 November 2007
Despicable Me," mildly entertaining
","i found this movie mildly entertaining,with a few light chuckles here and there,but i don't think it wasn't as funny as i had hoped or expected it to be.there were no real 'laugh out loud,tears rolling down your face moments'.i think it was just a case of a lot of the jokes falling flat.it had some cute moments though,and of course there's a feel good ending.it's suitable for the whole family and kids will get a kick out of it.for me,it was just this side of boring.compared to a lot of animated films i've seen this one just doesn't stack up.having said that,however,it's far from being awful.it's just not great.for me,Despicable Me is a 5/10",7,4,9,2 March 2011
Carrie," nearly perfect movie...just one major flaw
","i finally got around to watching 'Carrie'.while it was worth the wait, i was a little disappointed.the first two thirds of the movie are very well done.it is very easy to sympathize with 'Carrie',given the evil witch(Piper Laurie in a brilliant performance)she has for a mother.Carrie(Sissy Spacek in an equally greet performance)is an awkward outsider who has been sheltered from life and does not fit in.she is frequently the target of mercilessly cruel verbal abuse and torment from her classmates.but Carrie has a secret.she has the ability to move objects with her mind.this ability could have been explored and developed more in the story.however,now we come to the last act of the film.after a particularly cruel prank(having a bucket of Pig's blood dumped all over her at the prom),Carrie exacts her revenge-sort of.and herein lies the one major problem with film.given her obvious humiliation and anger,you expect the cruel mongers would get their just rewards for what they have done.yet the revenge that Carrie exacts is much less than what these wretches deserve and is anti climatic.her so called mother also deserves a much worse fate than she receives,as well.although the destruction of the house and its being swallowed up by the earth does imply that she gets her just reward in hell.the only problem is that Carrie is with her and hardly deserves the same fate.there is however much more that is positive about this film than negative.the brilliant performances from the two leads,as mentioned,and the very well executed direction,which provides many moments of tension and suspense.the most important aspect of this film,however is the brilliant score by Pino Donagio,which elevates this movie to a whole new level.so,how to rate this film.only one flaw,although a major one. 6.5* stars seems fair for this movie",7,1,2,22 October 2006
The Queen," Helen Mirren is astounding as The Queen
","i have to admit,i had no really interest in seeing this movie.but a friend brought it over,so i thought why not.turns out it was a mixed blessing.on the one hand,Helen Mirren absolutely channels Queen Elizabeth.her performance is unreal.and James Cromwell is good as her husband.however,the actor portraying Prince Charles,was,in my mind miscast.i also didn't think the movie was in depth enough.for me there just wasn't enough substance.that's not to say it's a bad movie.it has its good moments.,and there are some compelling scenes.but overall,i just didn't find it spectacular.but Helen Mirren elevates the material.hence,for me,The Queen is a 6/10",6,1,3,22 August 2009
1408," i think i've seen this movie before
","i liked this movie mildly.it is really bizarre,which is not surprising.it does come from the imagination of Stephen King.the thing is,i felt like i'd already seen this movie before.so it isn't completely original.it seems to take elements from other movies and meld them all into one.the other thing is that it's convoluted.after it's over,no explanation is given for what happened.for me,a movie doesn't necessarily have to resolve everything,but i would prefer if it presented some possibilities.this one just seemed unfinished.i didn't find the movie all that creepy.i did find it loud and chaotic though.and i have to admit i felt it was over acted at times.it's far from being a bad movie,but i don't think it lived up to the hype.but strangely enough,i still think it rates a 7/10",7,0,0,18 October 2007
Raging Bull," raging bull? raging bore
","wow, what a letdown.i had heard friends and critics say that raging bull was a great movie,even a masterpiece.well,i finally decided to watch it.all i can say is...i don't think so.i found the entire movie a complete bore and horribly depressing.the movie may have been based on a true story,and maybe Scorsese was going for reality,but i'm sorry, what a horrible human being Jake Lomatta is.how can anyone remotely sympathize with this wretch.he deserved everything he got.but this is the one time Hollywood should have taken dramatic license and made the character into a semblance of a human being.anyway, the film chronicles the rise and fall of boxer Jake Lomatta played by Robert Deniro.Scorsese filmed the movie in black and white,supposedly for effect,but it was lost on me.a good movie needs a main character you can relate to and/or sympathize with and this movie doesn't have that.there are no redeeming qualities in this movie.i felt like i wanted to kill myself after watching it.simply put this movie is a colossal waste of time.i know many people totally disagree with this view point and i can't for the life of me understand why,but that's life. 0* out of 10",1,24,60,14 October 2006

","this movie has a lot of good things going for it.one of them is the great ensemble cast.this includes Al Pacino and Cameron Diaz as the marquee names.however,i don't think they were the stars of the show.that distinction is shared with the supporting cast.there are some big names here.Jamie Foxx and Dennis Quaid are both terrific.LL Cool J also puts in a strong performance.James Woods give his usual good performance.in smaller roles,but no less effective,are Matthew Modine,Aaron Eckhart and John C.McGinley.Lauren Holley,though, puts in a very strong performance and really impressed me.the movie also has a high degree of realism during the scenes on the football field.you can hear every bone crunching hit wit astounding clarity.and there is a high energy atmosphere for the most part.there are some down sides to the movie,though.one of these is the running time,at over two and a half hours.i felt they could have shaved off maybe twenty minutes.also i felt that the movie doesn't always follow through with the momentum it builds.it gets a bit tedious at times.finally,the scenes with Cameron Diaz and Al Pacino together.i felt Pacino tended to overact a bit,and Diaz seemed a bit out of her depth.Diaz was pretty good otherwise.anyway,for me,Any Given Sunday is a 6/10",6,0,1,21 January 2008
Iron Man," more than an action movie
","this is one movie that was way better than i thought it would be.it's not just an action movie.it's also a smart,cleverly written movie,with some great dialogue.it also incorporates real global problems,serving as a sort of commentary on our times.it's not preachy,it just shows how far we've progressed.or maybe regressed as a society.there is also the theme of redemption in the movie.i mentioned the good dialogue.an example of that is the witty banter between Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.)and his assistant Pepper Pots(Gwyneth Paltrow).beyond that though,Stark is generally witty.i liked the origin story of the film,though i can't say whether or not it's accurate to the comic book.naturally,there are some great action sequences,especially the flying scenes and the combat scenes.and that suit is very impressive,both in looks and functionality.as to the cast,Downey is very good as Stark/Iron Man.Paltrow is very likable as Pepper Potts.Terrance Howard is good as Stark's military friend Rhodey,but i feel he was underutilized.oh well,maybe the sequel will rectify that.i heard that Howard is being replaced in the sequel by Don Cheadle.nothing against Cheadle,but i think they ought to stick with Howard,since he originated the character in the film.but the best actor in the bunch,in my opinion is Jeff Bridges,who gives a William Hurt type performance,understated,yet simmering with passion and charisma.that's just my opinion.anyway,,the movie is fun and engaging,but it's no empty headed action movie.not that there's anything wrong with that.no,this is a smart movie with heart and soul.my vote for Iron Man: 9/10",9,2,2,23 November 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," better than i had expected
","I found this latest film in the DC Cinematic universe quite entertaining.this isn't an origin story(except for a few brief moments)which is refreshing.Henry Cavill is back as Clark Kent/Superman and is again very good here.Ben Affleck is really good as Batman/Bruce Wayne.Gal Gadot is exceptional as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman.as is Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor.the rest of the supporting cast, many of whom return from the previous film,Man of Steel are all good as well.most movies in the DC Cinematic Universe are criticised as being too bleak and dark,especially compared to Marvel.i don't feel that way myself,although I can understand why some people might think that way.However,for those people,there may be a change on the horizon,if the trailer to the upcoming Justice League is any indication.for me,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is an 8/10",8,3,4,14 August 2016
Tombstone," powerful performances from Kurt Russel and Val Kilmer
","i really enjoyed this western,headlined by Kurt Russel(Wyatt Earp)and Val Kilmer(Doc Holliday). i thought Russel was very strong as Earp.he really has some charisma and stage presence,at least in this movie.but i thought Val Kilmer was mesmerising as Doc Holliday.he put in a really touching performance.as for the characters,i really liked what they did with the character of Earp.i thought he was well developed and i liked the internal conflict he had.this came across very strongly with Russel's performance.the rest of the characters are supporting players but no less effective,for the most part.Sam Elliott was great as Morgan Earp,one of Wyatt's brothers.i didn't like Bill Paxton that much as Virgil,another Earp brother.he just didn't do it for me.i just didn't by him or his performance.that's just my opinion of course.i like some of Paxton's work,but i just don't think he fit in this movie.Michael Bien was very good as Johnny Ringo,although it took a little time to warm up to him.the rest of the supporting cast was also good.even though i enjoyed this movie quite a bit,i didn't like it as much as as Kevin Costner's Open Range or Brad Pitt's The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford.i think maybe the story had a bit more depth and dimension in those two movies.Still,Tombstone is never boring and there are some spectacular Gunfights.for me,Tombstone is a strong 8/10",8,1,2,19 April 2008

","i'm afraid i have to disagree with the high rating this film has(8.3/10)i found it tortuously slow and i couldn't finish watching,though i tried hard.so many people rave about this film,and i'm at a loss to explain.yes,it is very stylish.it has a very atmospheric dark mood to it.it's also pretty creative,i guess,or it was for that time.but the problem i have with the movie is the action is much too sublime for my tates.i need a bit more happening in the movie i watch.or at least more compelling dialogue.i didn't think the screenplay was all that great either.so when you you add all this up,you're left with one big yawn fest.this is just my opinion,of course,and i wouldn't say it's a bad movie.i do think it's overrated though..Ridley Scott is apparently going to release a definitive version of the film i the not too distant future,so that may be a better version.as for this film as it stands, i can only give 'Blade Runner' a 5/10,mainly due to its style.",5,2,11,27 July 2007
Bruce Almighty," '...and that's the way the cookie crumbles.'
","as far as Jim Carrey movies goes,this is not one of his funniest.there are definitely some hilarious moments to be sure,and a fair amount of amusing moments.but it's more of a fantasy/drama than a comedy.it's definitely entertaining and well worth watching.just don't expect a laugh a minute.Basically,Bruce(Carrey)a chronic complainer to God)is given God's powers so he can he can find out for himself how hard it is to run things.Jennifer Anniston co-stars and is decent enough but doesn't have a lot to work with.Steve Carell has one very funny scene which had me in stitches.and Morgan Freeman was good in a small but pivotal role.overall,a very entertaining movie that will keep you occupied for just over ninety minutes.for me,Bruce Almighty is a 7/10",7,0,0,28 April 2011
Casino Royale," i think it is one of the best Bond film in years
","i think this is one of the best bond films in recent memory.it'more realistic(for a Bond film)the fight scenes are better and the whole movie is just more exciting.i also thought they made Bond more human,instead of almost superhuman,like in some of the films.the movie is much more story and character based,so there are no gadgets,which i really like about this movie.also think Daniel Criag is very natural as Bond.he's a very good actor.in my mind,he is 1 of the top 2 bonds of the series.i saw this movie in the theatre,which is the best place to see it,if you have a chance.i really enjoyed myself with this movie.it is fairly long but that doesn't take anything away from the movie.the only thing i didn't like,and this is just my own personal opinion,was the title sequence.it does fit with the movie,but it just didn't do it for me.anyway,that'a minor complaint and nothing to do with the movie itself.for me,'Casino Royale' is a 9/10",9,3,9,19 March 2007
Toy Story 3," the best one of the trilogy
","in my opinion,this is the best of three films in the series.i thought the story was better,there was more depth,not just to the story but in characterization,as well.this one was much more exciting and faster paced and even though it was the longest of the three films,it didn't seem that way.there was also more heart and soul in this film.at least i thought so.it looks fantastic on Blu-ray.all three films are wonderful and would be a great addition to your collection,but for me,this third one has that special something that makes it just a bit better.it sits currently at #33 on the top 250 on this site and is well deserving of that ranking.for me,Toy Story 3 is a 9/10",9,0,0,23 April 2011
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," the best in the series so far
","to my amazement,this third film is the series is actually better than the first two.i really enjoyed the first one,and thought the second one was pretty good,but was a step or two down.but this one was funnier,and had a better storyline.and more and better action sequences.plus,the animation is actually better.one thing that really worked in favour with this movie is that they didn't over do it with the jokes.they knew when to hold back and just how far to go.they also knew how far to utilize the character of Scrat,who may be a secondary character but is very popular.there is a wealth of material for the series to keep going as long as the writing continues to be strong.if the filmmakers continue the less is more philosophy,this franchise should continue to be successful.for me,Ice Age:Dawn Of the Dinosaurs is a 9/10",9,0,1,25 December 2009
Bull Durham," first of three baseball themed films starring Kevin Costner
","i enjoyed this little baseball drama/lite comedy movie starring Kevin Costner,Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins.it's one of three baseball themed films starring Costner,the other two being Field of Dreams and For Love of the Game,both of which i have seen and will post reviews of.as for this film,even though i'm not a baseball fan,i still liked the movie.it tries hard to make the game seem profound,but it doesn't quite convey it,in my opinion.the three main characters are likable and sympathetic,so you really want to root for them,yet at the same time they are sad and almost tragic.but the movie is worth watching.it never gets boring.for me,Bull Durham is a 7/10",7,0,2,4 January 2010
Signs," what if?
","Signs is a thoroughly engaging,thought provoking film.it makes for very compelling viewing.i won't get into the plot here,as i'm sure many people have already done that.suffice to say it involves aliens.the film is not only directed by M. Night Shyamalan,but he also wrote and produced it.there's loads of suspense and vibe of creepiness and tension throughout the film.the the characters are well developed,and the story is good.i'd rate it a bit higher than the rating of 6.9 it currently has here on this site.i think it's a clever film.it's inevitable it would be compared to The Sixth Sense,M. Night Shyamalan's breakout and by most accounts brilliant film,but these are two different films and two different genres,so this film should be judged on its own merits.for me,Signs is an 8/10",8,2,8,14 April 2011
The Deer Hunter," one of the better ones out there dealing with The Vietnam War or any War
","well,i don't think they make movies like this one anymore.and that's a darn shame,because this is one powerful,well made movie with a great story to tell.it shows the real horrors of war and how it changes people.it is also powerfully illustrates how little value some people place on human life.there are a couple of scenes that reflect this very well.i won't give any of the plot away,as i think the movie is too good for that,and should be seen without knowing beforehand what's in store.it is over 3 hours long,but it is very compelling viewing,and never boring.it is however sad and tragic,even startling.Robert De Niro heads the cast,which also includes Christopher Walken,Meryl Streep,John Savage,John Cazale,and George Dzunda.Walken won the academy award for best supporting actor for his performance and deservedly so.his performance is powerful.De Niro,who i usually don't care for,was excellent in this film.i also thought Streep was very good.my only regret is that i waited so long to see this movie.it is certainly worth the wait.a word of warning:it is very disturbing.my vote for The deer Hunter is a 10/10",10,2,5,1 April 2009
Speed," solid action,nail biting tension
","before this movie,who knew Keanu Reeves could be a credible action hero?Reeves impressed me with this effort.he put on a few ponds of muscle for this one.Sandra Bullock is also in this one,and although her character is likable,she just doesn't make the same impression as Reeves does.i guess part of the reason is that her character really isn't the focus,which can't really be blamed on her.Dennis hopper has a nice turn as a sadistic villain.aside from the acting though,there are a lot of good things about this movie.one is the relentless action.this thing really movies.it's also a real nail biter at times.the writing by Graham Yost is also good,as is the direction of Jan de Bont.as far as action movies go,this one is right up there,in my opinion.i give 'Speed' a solid 8/10",8,2,4,2 June 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," a real rush,but those of you who need a little bit of reality and/or logic to their action won't like it
","this ,the 4th installment of the Die hard franchise is easily the most thrilling and action packed.however,logic and reality are thrown out the window for the action scenes.if you like your action with a little bit of realty and logic,you won't like this movie.but for me,the movie was so fun,i didn't care.but beyond being just a slam bang action thrill ride it's also very relevant and thought provoking.if the technology that society almost totally depend on were to completely crash,how would you react,and hoe would the general public react.this movie gives one hypothetical example of the answer to that question.it's great to see this installment is geared more towards our techno savvy contemporary audience.but it's also still great for audiences that grew up with the franchise. not only is this a thrilling and thought provoking movie,but it's also very funny,possibly the funniest of all four movies.for me,Live Free or Die Hard is a perfect 10/10 for sheer excitement alone.the rest is just gravy.",10,1,3,16 February 2008
The Sixth Sense," a modern psychological suspense masterpiece
","i'm not going to give much of the plot of this one away,just in case you're one of the three people on the planet who hasn't seen this movie.suffice to say that it is one of the greatest psychological suspense thrillers in modern time.this is one eerie movie,strongly anchored by the performance of Haley Joel Osment.,who plays the character to which the title refers.Bruce Willis and Toni Collette also put in strong performances.and watch for a brilliant performance from an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg(yes that Donnie Wahlberg from 'New Kids on the Block' fame).who knew he could act?you will almost certainly have to watch this movie more than once,and you will discover something new each time.if you have'nt seen it,and somehow have managed to avoid knowing anything about it,i highly recommend it.to end,i will just say that this movie is a modern Masterpiece.10+++/10",10,2,3,4 June 2007
The Producers," way better than the 2005 remake
","this Mel Brooks directorial debut is actually much better than the 2005 remake.this one actually has some amusing moments.it wasn't what i would call hysterically funny or anything.but it was entertaining.Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel work well together,and have great chemistry,whereas in the remake,Nathan Lane and Mathew Broderick merely grated on me.my only real complaint with this version was that it gets a bit too loud at times,as in too much shouting and screaming,which never really does anything for me.otherwise,i actually didn't mind it.definitely way better than the insipid remake.for me,The Producers (1968) is a 6/10",6,1,3,14 February 2010
Final Destination," unique,effective thriller
","this is a pretty good entry in the thriller genre,with a twist.the killer in this one is unseen.death,to be exact.the unique premise in this one is that death has a design and is targeting a group of people according to that same design.sounds far fetched and way out there, right?well it is,and if you have trouble,suspending your disbelief,this is not your movie.many of the things that happen defy belief.but, get your head around that,and you have a thrilling,intense movie.it may be pretty gruesome for some people.it's also quite oppressive in feel.there is a definite pallor of doom hanging over it.overall,it's very effective.i enjoyed it a lot and highly recommend it to anyone who likes the thriller genre of movies.just remember to throw any semblance of realty out the window before watching.",Null,1,5,16 June 2007
The Purge," welcome to a world where all crime is legal one night a year for twelve hours
","I liked this movie.it was suspenseful,thrilling well acted and unpredictable.at least I thought so.basically,the U.S. government has sanctioned one day a year,for twelve hours where any crime,including murder is legal.this is called the purge.as I said I liked the movie.the premise is very creative.at ;east to me. I haven't seen anything like it.it takes some interesting twists and turns and doesn't end up the way I thought it would.it stars Ethan Hawke as James Sandin,Lena Heady as his wife,Max Burkholder as their son Charlie and Adelaide Kane as their daughter Zoey.together they must try and and make it through the purge without being killed.that is all I will say on that.for me,The Purge is an 8/10",8,0,2,5 October 2016
A Nightmare on Elm Street," introduces a new iconic villain
","as far as horror films goes,this is one of the best in modern times.the premise is unique,as far as I know.but I could be wrong on that count.the acting is good,the dialogue fairly well written.i don't think it's award winning or anything.it has a villain that is instantly iconic.the characters are all sympathetic,so you are invested in what happen to them.of course,like in most horror films,most of the characters will be killed,but you don't who will go first.Johny Depp has his screen but here,and he still managed to get work in the industry and became a huge star,so I guess this movie wasn't a career killer.if you haven't seen it,i won't give anything away.i will simply say that it is not as graphically bloody(except for one scene)as most horror films made today.for me,A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 7/10",8,0,1,18 September 2016
The Matrix," not sure what all the hype is about.
","i'm not sure what the big deal is about this movie.i mean,it borrows heavily from other sources,such as the bible and Star Wars,among others.the gist of the story is that the world people see around them is isn't real.it's actually a construct made by machines.Humanity is actually enslaved by the machines.but there is one man who can free humanity.that man may be a hacker who goes by the name Neo.Neo is portrayed by Keanu Reeves.also playing prominent roles are Carrie Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne.but in my mind,it is Hugo weaving who steals the show as the enigmatic agent Smith.i will admit the movie has some great special effects and some spectacular fight scenes.but some of the moves in the fights are really silly and are not what i would call practical.also,a lot of the movie is slow moving,and the characters don't behave in logical ways.still,the movie does have its good moments.there are some genuine moments of high tension.this is the first of three movie in The Matrix franchise.for me,the first movie in the series is a 6/10",4,3,5,22 February 2008
Shall We Dance," Bored lawyer adds spice to his life by secretly taking ballroom dance lessons
","this movie is a remake of a Japanese film made in 1996.i haven't seen the original,so i'll only comment on this,the 2004 version.This movie is about a bored lawyer who has been married for nearly 20 years and had the same job for a long time.he decides to spice up his life and without telling anyone begins taking ball room dance lessons.Richard Gere is John Clark,the bored lawyer.Susan Sarandon is his wife.Jennifer Lopez is the dance instructor who John feels a connection to.Stanley Tucci provides some light comic relief as one of the students.This is a whimsical,light hearted movie .it is enjoyable and there are some good performances.Gere in particular seems to really be having fun with his character during the dance scenes.Lopez,however,comes off a bit stiff and forced at times.Tucci turns in another great supporting performance and is very funny at times.Lisa Ann Walter also provides some laughs with her character Bobby.Richard Jenkins plays a detective named Devine,hired by Clark's wife Beverly(Susan Sarandon)who suspects he may be having an affair.Nick Cannon plays Devine's assistant.Susan Sarandon is very good as Beverly Clark,but has a fairly small role in the film.the film is a romantic comedy,emphasis on romantic,but as previously mentioned,does have some comedic elements.the comedy is more of the amusing,chuckling type of laughs.there is nothing which could be called hysterical.if that's what you're looking for,this is not your movie.the movie is fairly predictable,and has the usual feel good ending,but arrives there a bit differently than i expected.Overall,i really enjoyed this movie. 8/10",8,0,2,25 January 2007
Casino," Nowhere near as good as it reputation(but entertaining,nonetheless)
","well,i finally got around to watching Martin Scorsese's 'Casino'tyhis one has some big names,but to be honest the only standout performance was by Sharon Stone'she runs the gamut of emotions in this one.i won't give any of it away,however.The rest of the actors are okay in their respective roles.Joe Pesci makes sure everyone knows he can skillfully add the f-word into nearly every sentence at least once.that is a dubious distinction and not really an impressive one.after awhile,it just gets annoying.credit that to Nicholas Pileggi,who wrote the script and co-wrote the screenplay(with Scorsese),based on his novel.anyway, considering how much this movie has been praised over the years,i expected something approaching spectacular.it is not spectacular,in any sense of the word.it is a good movie that is entertaining and well paced,given its nearly 3 hour running time.but a disappointment if you are expecting a movie that will knock your socks off and remain with you for days. i just watched it,and it's already fading from memory.keep your expectations low for this one,and you won't be too disappointed.6/10",6,2,7,24 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," the landmark space fantasy
","what can you say about his movie.it set the bar by which all movies to come would be judged,and this was 1977.i'm talking about the visual effects,which were nothing less than astounding.it still stands up well to any movie in that regard.remember,they didn't have the benefit of CGI back then,so they relied on miniatures.when you add to that,a compelling story and a soon to be iconic villain(not to mention,the colourful cast of characters)and you have box office gold.sure,the dialogue may be wooden and stilted at times,but that is overshadowed by the achievement of the film.Besides,the film was marketed at 12 year olds,so they're not gonna care about stupid things like dialogue.The original 'Star Wars' or as it is subtitled 'a New Hope,was a landmark film and single handedly reinvented the science fiction genre. Obviously 10/10",10,5,6,22 February 2007
The Replacements," heartwarming,funny
","i enjoyed this sports comedy/romance.i found it funny,touching and engaging.it's not one of those bust a gut funny movies,it's more of the pretty good chuckles variety.it's one of those feel good kind of movies,where you just can't help but root for the guy and girl to get together.even the action bits(mostly comedic football action) are good.Gene Hackman and Keanuu Reeves are the headliners,but i found Brooke Langton to be very good in her role.it's nice to see Hackman and Reeves in a lite movie,rather than the intense movies they're usually known for.at the end of the movie,i felt pretty good.at the very least,you might forget about you problems for awhile.for me,The Replacements is a 7/10",7,2,4,31 December 2008
Cube," a template for 'Saw'?
","Cube is an example of minimalist film-making at its best.this movie may have been the template for 'Saw'.the plot is very simple.basically,a group of people find themselves in a labyrinthine maze full of rooms,many of which are filled with lethal traps.the group must then try to to survive and find a way out.there is an interesting group dynamic going on as each person reacts differently to their predicament,each offering their own ideas of why they are there and how to escape. naturally paranoia sets in affecting each person differently,with conspiracy theories abounding.the acting performances are solid.however,there is never any clear reason given as to why these people are there,and who or what may be behind it all. this is the only complaint i have of this movie.it would have been nice to know the purpose of it all and the motivation behind it. this a minor complaint though.this a very thought provoking film,which does not rely heavily on special effects,or gore,though there are two gruesome scenes.this is more of a study of psychology and human relations.it is a very low key movie,which works in its favor. 6* out of 10",6,0,1,21 October 2006
Apollo 13," excellent
","i remember watching this film eons ago,and thinking it was horrible.in fact,i even fell asleep while watching it.however,i decided to revisit it a few days ago and had the exact opposite reaction.this time,i thought it was brilliant.i thought the story flowed perfectly,and the tension mounted at just the right tempo and hung there until the very end.the acting was spot on.and the music added the perfect atmosphere.i haven't seen too many Ron Howard film's,but this is one of the best that i have seen of his.i would encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to check it out.who knows,you might be surprised,for me Apollo 13 is a 9/10",9,2,2,25 October 2009
The Thin Red Line," a real yawner
","yawn.just thinking about this movie puts me to sleep.this is 170 minutes of your life you will never get back,so think carefully before attempting to watch this thing.as far as i can recall(and it does pain me to do so)there's virtually no action.unless soldiers walking through field is action.and once in a while,a shot is fired,and some grass flies in to the air,but that's it.i guess the movie is more about the psychological effects of war,and that's fine,but in my opinion,there should be some action as well,or at least some interesting dialogue.this movie gave me a headache and depressed me to no end.it's not for action buff,that much is certain.it's not my bag,that's for sure.for a realistic,riveting and exciting war movie,i'd recommend Saving Private Ryan.a word of warning though,it is brutally graphic in its realism.anyway,as for The Thin Red Line,i give it a 110",1,1,8,16 August 2007
Fantastic Four," decent superhero film,though not of the epic scale
","this movie was certainly entertaining,although it felt a bit incomplete somehow.it is certainly not a movie you would call epic,by any means.it is much more low key than your typical blockbuster movie,i.e the Spider Man or X-Men series.i believe the filmmakers were going for blockbuster status,but the film did not reach that level.from both a critical and artistic standpoint,this movie was received lukewarmly at best(although some critics and fans praised it.)one of the problems is that the story could have been developed better.the filmmakers focused more on style than substance.the special effects were pretty decent,although at times they were a little hokey.this is probably due to the relatively low budget of 80 million dollars.also some of the dialogue was cringe worthy at times.however,the acting was solid,their was plenty of action and the film was not boring.However,like i said,the story was sacrificed for style.there is a sequel in the works.let's hope it's more fleshed out.as for this film,despite a few flaws,it was relatively well made.this film gets a strong 7/10",7,0,1,29 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The strongest Entry in the Star Wars Saga
","how do you top a movie like the original star wars.well,it's not easy,but you make a better movie.by better,i mean a more fleshed out storyline and characters.also the motivations of some characters are more clearly defined.this movie is definitely darker than the original,which makes sense since the enemy triumphs,if only for a short time.this movie built upon the strengths of the 1st one,namely good story line which carries the movie forward and of course the villain,who is much stronger in this installment.it goes without saying that the visual effects are once again outstanding.this entry is considered by many to be the strongest of the saga,and rightly so.it sets up perfectly for its sequel'return of the Jedi'.this film gets a very strong 10/10 only because that is the highest rating given by IMDb",10,1,2,22 February 2007
Gangs of New York," long,but doesn't feel like it
","this is a Martin Scorsese epic,and it certainly has that epic feel.i'm not sure how accurate it is historically,or if things really looked the way they do in the movie.i still liked the look of it.to me,it seems a lot of work went into the whole production and it shows.Daniel Day Lewis is astonishing(nothing new for him).Leonardo DiCaprio was also good.Cameron Diaz was not bad,but she didn't really impress me all that much.her character wasn't as substantial as it could have been.like in many movie,there's a good supporting cast.the movie is brutally violent,which is probably an accurate depiction of that time.it is over two and a half hours long,but it doesn't feel like it.i found myself becoming very quickly and easily involved in the story,a sign of a good movie.i wouldn't call it a masterpiece,but it is a very good movie.for me,Gangs of New York is an 8/10",8,1,2,28 January 2008
Windtalkers," spectacular action sequences
","this Second World War film directed by John Woo has it's good moments and it's not so good moments.the action sequences are spectacular.the acting is good,as well.what doesn't work so well are the dramatic moments.they really slow the momentum of the movie down.in some spots,it's downright tedious to get through.the film focuses on one battle during WWII in which Navajo Marines used their language as a radio code the Japanese could not break.another Marine would be assigned to protect the 'code talker' at all costs.the movie is inspired by a true story,so how accurate it is,is anyone's guess.for me,Windtalkers is a 5/10",5,1,2,16 April 2011
Coach Carter," the movie is inspirational without being preachy and Samuel L.Jackson puts on an acting clinic
","there are many 'based on true events,underdog stories' made into movies.but this one is different.yes,it is inspirational,but it isn't preachy and schmaltzy like so many have been.maybe the studios are finally seeing the light.after all,this is the second recent movie of the genre(that i have seen) to get it right,the other being 'Glory Road'.as for 'Coach Carter',it's a pretty subdued affair.it focuses on a High School basketball coach(Samuel.L.Jackson)who has a vision for the students at his school.not only will they become winners on the basketball court,but they will also be inners off.this means as human beings,they will lose he loser,mediocrity mentality which has been ingrained intro them,by the school system and even their parents.of course,he meets fierce opposition.does he succeed in this vision?well,lets just say things don't go quite the way you might expect them to.this movie is very character and story driven,so don't expect a lot of action.there aren't that many basketball sequences.much of the movie takes place off the court.but the movie works for 3 reasons.first,its ability to tell an inspirational story without bringing out the sledgehammer.second,the the supporting performances are all credible.but more important is the masterful acting of Samuel L.Jackson.the man is simply mesmerizing.you believe every second of his performance.the man has great screen presence and charisma and the emotion he conveys is real.the movie is long,but it's all about getting there,not being there,and the journey is worth it,in my opinion.",7,0,0,3 August 2007
True Romance," directed by Tony Scott, written by Quentin Tarantino
","for me,Tony Scott can be hit(Crimson Tide,Top Gun and miss(Domino,Man On Fire) as a director.so where does he fit with this particular film.well for me,it's a hit.this is a fairly fast paced film.with lots of action,there lots of violence and bloodshed in this one,but there are also some tender and dramatic moments,which are handled well.the dialogue is sharp and clever and there are some memorable characters.much of the credit of that must go to Quentin Tarantino,who wrote the script.but to his credit Scott was also much more restrained in his directing style back then compared to on more recent films like Domino,where everything is hyper-kinetic and migraine inducing.bottom line-i found True Romance entertaining on all levels.but be warned,it is extremely violent and there is a lot of very strong language.for me,True Romance is an 8/10",8,0,3,27 March 2010

","i have to say,this animated movie was disappointing,to say the least.to me,it had no point to it.i also found it too long.with a title like 'Happy Feet',you would expect the movie to be uplifting,if nothing else.at least,i did. if you're In a depressed mood before watching this movie you likely won't be feeling much better after the end credits roll.the movie was marketed as being a comedy,and being uplifting and even inspirational.i saw none of those elements.maybe i watched a different movie.there are two positive things about this movie.first,the voice actors fit their roles very well.two,the animation was very well done.other than that,my friend and i just kept hoping it would end.for me 'Happy Feet'is 4/10* at best",4,0,1,11 April 2007

","'Gladiator' is a roman epic directed by Ridley Scott (Kingdom of Heaven,Hannibal,Matchstick men)David Franzoni(KIng Arthur,Amistad) wrote the story and the screenplay.the movie is the story of Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridious(Russel Crowe) and his quest to avenge the death of his wife and son by the hands of Commodus,Joaquin Phoenix)neglected son of dying Empopore Marcus Aurelius.this is the basic plot line,although of course there is much more going on.Scott is Masterful in his direction,weaving a brilliant story of Roman times.i can't say how accurate it is to history,but then,i don't care.if i want a history listen,i will watch a documentary.many people will not see a film because they believe it to be inaccurate historically.that is their loss.they miss out on some great experiences.Gladiator is one such experience.beautiful to look at,compelling story,good characterizations and very entertaining.Of course the acting abilities of both Crowe and Phoenix elevate most films they appear in,and this is no exception.Of course the writing of David Franzoni must also be given its due.he has crafted a wonderful, thrilling tale,which Ridley Scott has brought to life on the silver screen.Brilliant all around easily a strong 10/10",10,1,2,13 January 2007
Contact," astronomer searches for life on other planets(you might be surprised at the outcome)
","this movie pleasantly surprised me.i had put off seeing it for years,mainly for 2 reasons.the first reason is that the movie looked like it would be 1 long bore.the 2nd reason is Jodie Foster.i have never been a fan of her.something about her just rubs me the wrong way.however,tonite the movie was on 1 of the movie channels,and i thought,what the heck.i'll give It a shot.i figured i'd watch for a short time,then become bored and do something else.that was not to be the case.yes,the movie is long,clocking in at almost exactly 2 and a half hours.but it doesn't feel like a 2 and a half hour movie.i thought the time went by rather quickly,and considering the subject matter,you wouldn't think that would be the case.the movie has a lot of dialogue and passive action,for the most part.a drama,more than anything.but the filmmakers made it interesting,and even compelling at times.the visual effects were very well done.the film has a beautiful look to it in many scenes.Jodie Foster did a good job in this movie,and i didn't find her annoying at all.i think she really brought some heart and soul,some passion to her character.i also liked the use of irony in a scene towards the end of the movie.it's nice to be pleasantly surprised once in awhile.for me 'Contact' is an 8.5/10",9,2,5,24 March 2007
The Social Network," highly recommended
","this movie about the creation of the phenomenon Facebook and the aftermath is one well crafted and compelling movie.David Fincher directed it and Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay.s.it's not hard to tell Sorkin had a hand din it.the dialogue just pops.the acting is superb all around.the main characters are well drawn.Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg,and it's hard not to feel some degree of empathy for the character,though i wouldn't exactly call him sympathetic.Andrew Garfield plays Eduardo Saverin,a co-founder of Facebook.but it's Justin Timberlake who i found really impressive as Sean Parker,founder of Napster.he plays a totally unlikable character and pulls it off perfectly.i would highly recommend this film.for me,The Social Network is an 8/10",8,0,0,24 April 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," return to action
","this third movie in the Indiana Jones series is much liter in tone than the second one,The Temple 0f Doom.there is also more action,a lot more.and there are also number of comic moments,courtesy of the banter between Indiana(Harrison Ford)and his Father,Henry(Sean Connery)the two have great general and comedic chemistry and both have some good lines.this movie is clever and witty.Connery is a nice addition to the series.i think it's as good,or near as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark,the first one in the series.i liked how the movie ended on a high note.this would have been a fitting end to the series,if they hadn't made a fourth installment,which i have yet to see.as for The Last Crusade,i think it rates a 9/10",9,0,1,15 June 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," almost as good as the first Bourne film(The Bourne Identity)
","while not quite as good as The Bourne Identity,this is still a great movie.Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne,and is outstanding.Franka Potente returns,as well,and puts in a good performance.again,we have a strong supporting cast.like 'Identity'this one has a lot of action,which is spectacular.the fight scenes are once again superb.again there's lots of tension and suspense,and twists and turns.the only real drawback i found to this movie,is that the dramatic scenes don't seem as compelling,and they seem to go on a bit too long sometimes.other than that,it's pretty much as good as as 'Identity'.for me 'The Bourne Supremacy' is an 8/10",8,3,4,11 August 2007
The Birds," another Hitchcock(not quite) classic
","this classic film by Alfred Hitchccock was undoubtedly terrifying when it first came out in 1963.it may be less terrifying by today's standards.but I still found It to be exciting,tense suspenseful and eerie.the acting here is very good,in my opinion,especially by Tippi Hedren.by today's standard it]s not as bloody.the movie is more about instilling fear and panic,not in grossing you out.it doesn't get as much attention as another Hitccock classic,Psycho.nevertheless it is eminently watchable.i would watch it again.just don't go into the movie thinking it will offer you buckets of blood,because you will then be disappointed.otherwise,you should enjoy it.for me,The Birds is a 7/10",7,0,2,18 September 2016
Beetlejuice," very creative
","this Tim Burton film is quite good,but i was a bit disappointed in one thing.for me, the character of Beetle Juice doesn't have enough scenes in the movie.he takes too long too actually appear first of all,and then his screen time is limited.however,the character is a real scream and Keaton is brilliant in the role,and there are some other very unique characters as well,and the world Tim Burton and company have created is fantastic.there are some truly very funny moments here. and the cast no doubt had a heck of a lot of fun making the movie.overall,the movie is exceptional,with just that one minor complaint.for me,Beetle Juice is an 8/10",8,1,2,4 September 2010
The Simpsons Movie," a laugh riot
","i loved this movie.i was skeptical about it ,thinking it would just be an overextended episode of the TV show.after all,many half hour shows have tried to transition into a successful feature length film,and very few actually succeed but since my friend bought it,i thought why not.as it turns out,this was one funny movie.and it actually had enough of a story to make a feature film.it was at least as funny as the earlier Simpsons episodes are,and a bit more risqu√É¬©.but the bottom line is that it is hysterically funny.i don't know what else to say,other than i'm just so happy the the movie actually succeeds,with a decent storyline.it probably helps if you've seen the TV show first,but i don't think it's necessary.The Simpsons movie gets a 10/10 from me",10,0,4,9 February 2008
Dodgeball," it has David Hasselhoff(that's not a good thing)
","i honestly don't get the critics,especially those who heap praise on this film,even suggesting it is one of the funniest movies ever.as Chandler Bing('from 'Friends')says--could they BE more wrong?most of the so called jokes in this turd are infantile at best.if you're three year old,you might find this thing amusing.but this tripe is probably beneath the intellect of most three year olds.so,why does this kind of thing get made.?who knows.apparently there's market out there for this brand of humour.i looked high and low,but could not find Rob Schneider's name connected with this mess anywhere.if i had,the mystery would be solved.i really expect something like this effort from Schneider(who should never be allowed near any movie set again.in fact i wish all the movie studios had a restraining order against him.that way,he can't get close enough to taint the movie)sorry about the rant.anyway this movie does have the talented Thespian(trust me,i'm kidding)David Hasselhoff instead.things don't get much worse than this.i'm in a generous mood,so i'll give 'Dodgeball:A true Underdog Story' 2/10",2,0,3,22 May 2007
The Fighter," great acting
","this film exceeded my expectations by quite a bit.i thought it would be an OK movie,but it was much better than that.the story is quite compelling for one thing.it just draws you in.but it's the acting that really makes this movie.Mark Wahlberg plays the title character,boxer 'Irish' Micky Ward.Christian Bale plays his crack addicted brother/trainer Dicky Ecklund ,Mellisa Leo plays the mother,and Amy Adams plays Ward's girlfriend.for me,Melissa Leo is a revelation here.Christian Bale was also very impressive,as was Amy Adams.Wahlberg is good in his role,but is outshone by the three people i just mentioned.one thing about this film:there is some very strong language.for me,The Fighter is an 8/10",8,0,2,25 March 2011
Evil Dead II," absolute garbage!!
","evil dead 2 is possibly the worst movie ever made.bad acting,a plot that made no sense and had more holes in it than swiss cheese.supposedly a sequel to the first one,it starts off as if the first one didn't exist.the whole movie is one incoherent mess.it was billed as being a scary movie, but my friend and i merely laughed at the absurdity of it all.granted,in most horror movies, characters do stupid things, but in this movie they do things that completely defy logic and reason.i could sort of be forgiving if these actions furthered the movie in some way, but since there is nothing resembling a plot,all they do is make things even more coherent and stupid.the effects were abysmal,even laughable.it looked like they spent five dollars on the whole movie.the first one was good,even scary at times,but the same cannot be said of this bomb.only rivaled in awfulness by 'the gate'.pure and utter garbage.avoid,avoid,avoid",1,12,33,3 October 2006
Up in the Air," breezy little film
","this was in interesting little film.it's basically about a guy(George Clooney)whose job requires him to live out of a suitcase for at least two thirds of the year.he flies around the country to different companies and tells people they been terminated from their positions with their company.basically he feels most at home on the road,so to speak.there's more to the story than that,but you'll have to watch the film if you want you know more.i thought the dialogue was clever and witty and the chemistry between the actors was good.and Clooney creates a sympathetic character.Jason Bateman really impressed with a small role.overall,this film had a breezy feel to it,in my opinion although it did also deal with some pretty weighty issues,which i thought were handled well and with respect.for me,Up in the Air is a 7/10",7,0,2,11 March 2010
V for Vendetta," a totalitarian government state of the future
","V for Vendetta is a pretty good movie.before watching it,i had no interest,just based on the trailers i had seen.but,it was on one of the movie channels,so i thought i'd give it a try.turns out,it is a much better movie than i thought it would be.it's basically set in the future,with a fascist European government and a terrorist(or freedom fighter,depending on your viewpoint)dressed as Guy Fawkes,a revolutionary in the 17th century,who tried to blow up the Parliament building)has for some time killing high level people in government and others from his past.his ultimate goal:to blow up the parliament buildings on the same date that Guy Fawkes had attempted,hundreds of years earlier.it sounds like it would be a bleak scenario,but the movie itself didn't seem bleak to me.there's lots of action,and there is some violence,but most of it is almost cartoonish(deliberately,i think)which makes it seem less graphic.the movie is certainly thought provoking,but it is also entertaining.for me,V for Vendetta is an 8.5/10",6,2,5,25 March 2007
The Island," drama,action suspense.this movie has it all
","i enjoyed this movie quite a bit.the 1st half or so is very dramatic,while the 2nd half is action packed and suspenseful.there are a lot chase scenes and things blowing up.the action is frenetic.i also liked the subject matter dealing with clones and the whole ethical/moral ramifications aspect.i thought it was very thought provoking.plus,it was fun.movies like this don't win too many awards,but that is not the intent.and,yes,there may be elements of implausibility,but if you go to the movies to escape the doldrums and routine of ordinary life,then whether something is realistic or not,is not likely a huge concern for you.i know for me,it's not.of course there are always exception.sometimes believability is thrown completely out the window over and over and over,to the point where almost nothing about the movie has any degree of realism.that bothers me.as for 'The Island' i think it contained enough realism for this kind of movie.i liked it,and though i wouldn't say it's a masterpiece,i'd give it a strong 8/10",8,1,3,15 March 2007
The Godfather," 'leave the gun,take the cannoli'
","much has been said about how great this film is,and i hesitated for the longest time before breaking down,but finally i bought the Restoration Box set which contains the three films and two bonus discs.so,after watching this first film,i must say i was pretty impressed.it's a well crafted film.at a running time of just over one hundred and seventy three minutes,you'd never know it.there never a dull moment.it's exceptionally engrossing from the opening frame to the closing credits.the acting is superb.Marlon Brandon is excellent,but i would say that a young Al Pacino matches him.the dialogue is also well written.for me,The Godfather is a 10/10",10,2,5,10 April 2010
