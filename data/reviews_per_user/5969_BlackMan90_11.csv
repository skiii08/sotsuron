Minority Report," Spielberg's best of the 2000s
","In the future, murders are prevented before they are performed. When pre-cog officer John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is accused of committing a pre-crime, he must find out why he will kill a man he has never met.'Minority Report' is Spielberg's best of the 2000s.Great story and script. It fast-paced, intelligent, and real at the same time.Tom Cruise gives a great emotional performance and uses his smile perfectly. Samantha Morton gives a great performance as a woman who is frighteningly not used to the world around her. Max Von Sydow is good, but not memorable. Colin Farrell gives a great snobby performance and his chemistry with Cruise is top-notch.The star of the film is Steven Spielberg. This movie is an old-school noir story, set in the future. The production design is high-tech with chrome and clear windows everywhere. The special effects are amazing, as well as the cinematography and editing. Visually this is one of the best movies. I've ever seen.Never boring and always interesting. This is Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' and 'The Color Purple' for the new millennium.",10,7,13,1 August 2007
Amistad," Flawed, but powerful
","Spielberg's worstPros: The powerful performances by the entire cast. Djimon Hounsou gives powerful emotion. Matthew McConaghuey would seem miscast, but he does a great job. He reminds of Tom Cruise at times. Anthony Hopkins is an absolute scene-stealer. He plays his role with the right amount of seniority, intelligence, and humbleness. Morgan Freeman is the weak link and is nothing more that a place holder. The visuals are stunning as they always are in a Spielberg film. Great cinematography, editing, and production design. The highlights of the film are the battle scenes, the slave capture, and the journey through the Middle Passage. Spielberg is master of re-creation and he doesn't disappoint here.Cons: Except for the 1st scene, the 1st hour is very boring, and the first act and a half seems very jumbled together. The speeches delivered by anyone except Hounsou, McConaghuey, or Hopkins are boring. The ending last hour tightens everything up, but the aftertaste of the beginning is still there.Overall: Flawed, but powerful",6,1,3,5 August 2007
Zodiac," Fincher's worst
","Very ambitious, but flawed. Scenes are mishandled, have the wrong tone, and have bad acting. Their are some bright spots though.As usual in a Fincher the cinematography and editing are top-notch. Gyllenhaal is kinda bland in the beginning, but comes alive and is great in the last hour and a half. Robert Downey Jr. turns in another great performance. Mark Ruffalo is great as well. John Carroll Lynch and Brian Cox also make the most of their appearances. Plus, the film has two of the most terrifying sequences I've ever seen.Despite this, the weak beginning lingers so much, that the film couldn't be elevated to great status.",7,3,5,15 September 2007
Batman Begins," Excellent
","This is the best Batman film yet. It tells the story of how Bruce Wayne, becomes Batman. His journeys take him from Gotham to Asia back to Gotham where he must save the city from destruction. It sounds clichÃ©d, but it's really unique in it's presentation.Christopher Nolan's direction is excellent. He creates a darker and more depressing Gotham city not seen in the previous Burton/Schumacher films. The cinematography and special effects are also great and they work with the dark mood of the film great. The fight scenes are perfectly edited. They show the quickness and panic of the scene.Nolan wrote the script along with David Goyer and it's truly great. It has great humor, great insight on revenge, justice, and relationships.Christian Bale (American Psycho, Equilibrium) is the best Batman yet. He completely inhabits the arrogance of Bruce Wayne and the strength and anger of Batman. Michael Caine (Educating Rita, Alfie) is a great replacement for Michael Gough as Alfred. He plays the English butler the only way he knows how: Sophisticated but also tough and witty. Gary Oldman (Dracula, Leon) gives a nice performance as Lt. Gordon, one of the only straight cops left in Gotham City. Katie Holmes (Pieces of April) plays Bruce's love interest Rachel Dawes. She gives a decent performance, but she is miscast because of her looks. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman.Now on to the bad guys.Liam Neeson (Schindler's List, Kinsey) plays Henri Ducard, a man that Bruce meets while is Asia. Henri ferociously trains Bruce to join the League of Shadows, an organization designed to restore balance to the world by any means necessary. Liam plays the role intensity and intelligence. Ken Watanabe plays Ra's Al Ghul, the leader of the League of Shadows. he doesn't have much to say, but broken speech is entertaining. Cillian Murphy plays Jonathan Crane, a psychologist at Arkham Asylum who is fascinated with fear. He cooperates with mob boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) and they smuggle drugs together. Along with drugs, they smuggle a gas Crane created that brings out a person's worst fears when inhaled. Murphy gives a great performance bringing instant creepiness to the character. Tom Wilkinson plays the mobster role quite well.OVERALL: If you're looking for a great movie, look no further",10,2,2,13 August 2006
The Insider," Well acted and directed, but poorly paced down the stretch.
","Michael Mann's 'The Insider' is directed with technical precision and skillfully acted by numerous veterans in this well-made drama about the exposure of the tobacco industry.The film follows Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) & Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino). Wigand is a scientist who is fired after he finds out that the tobacco company he works for, chemically alters nicotine. Bergman is a producer for the CBS show '60 Minutes' who entices Wigand to speak out against the tobacco industry. Based on the Larie Brenner article 'The Man Who Knew Too Much', Eric Roth & Michael Mann write a thorough and enticing screenplay.Russell Crowe gives his best performance to date. His subtle and heartfelt performance anchors the film. Gaining ? pounds and greying his hair, Crowe transforms himself into this sympathetic character. We feel his anguish and pain. Al Pacino gives an underrated performance as Lowell Bergman. He is efficient & gets the job done, but he truly cares about the stories he works on and Pacino shows this perfectly. Crowe and Pacino play their parts perfectly and their character chemistry is great. Christopher Plummer gives a good, albeit overrated performance as Mike Wallace. Diane Venora gives a natural, underrated performance. Her chemistry with Russell Crowe and emotional depth give the film a heart. Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, and Colm Feore add veteran backup. This is an efficient cast, but the film loses steam when Crowe, Pacino, or Venore aren't on screen together.The cinematography, sound mixing, and editing gives the film a documentary feel to it. Michael Mann's rapid, fast-paced editing succeeds in making the film seem shorter than it actually is. Mann uses very small things to develop tension in between characters. The films only fault is the pacing down the line. It feels like it has several endings. But just as soon as it starts dragging, a key encounter occurs that grips you back into the film. This is a surprise because Heat & Collateral were expertly paced.All in All, this is a film that is well acted and directed, but poorly paced down the stretch.",8,1,3,3 March 2007
The Last Samurai," Excellent
","The Last Samurai is an excellent movie.It's about an American who embraces the Samurai culture and fights against his own country. The script does something that most epics fail to do: Make the story understandable. The viewer can understand what's happening and not be confused.Tom Cruise gives another great performance as the American chief Nathan Algren. He starts off a depressed alcoholic and becomes the fierce soldier that he once was. Ken Watanabe also gives a great performance as the samurai leader Katsumoto. He becomes the character with fierce tenacity and intensity, but also with warmth and respect. They have great chemistry together.Great cinematography, art direction, and costume designs. Good visual effects every once in a while. Brilliant battle scenes.OVERALL: Excellent film",10,1,3,30 June 2006
Titanic," Good, but flawed
","The shipwreck of the Titanic is one of the greatest sequences ever directed. The editing, tense score, and the performances of Winslet and Zane are all top-notch. If the whole movie was from the beginning of the shipwreck to the final ending, this would be one of the greatest films ever made. But with everything that came before that, it's just a very good film.Their's nothing really wrong with the beginning, but the anticipation of the sinking makes me continuously look at the clock. The script is kinda cheesy, but it fits Cameron's glamorous direction perfectly. Some of the best production design ever. Winslet's best, and her only great, performance. DiCaprio is weak, but their chemistry together is great. Zane, Gloria Stuart, and Kathy Bates are all great supporters.",8,3,5,15 September 2007
The Departed," Best film of the year
","The Departed, based on the Japanese film, 'Infernal Affairs', is the best film of the year and never fails to entertain.It's about an undercover police officer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who infiltrates the mob (Lead by Jack Nicholson), and a young gangster (Matt Damon) who infiltrates the police department. William Monahan's writes the best script of the year. His Boston dialog and aura, diverse characters, and quick twists will keep you on the edge of your seat.Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of the best performances of the year. He plays his character with an anxious fidgetyness and a bunch of controlled fear and anger. Matt Damon gives a criminally underrated performance. His character isn't entirely bad, but I feel that he does the deceptive things he does out of honor and devotion to his 'Dad'. Jack Nicholson is a constant threat in this film. His tenacity and unpredictability strikes fear in the hearts of everyone he comes in contact with. He demands respect and he gets it. His chemistry with Leo and Matt is top-notch. Mark Wahlberg play an A-Hole in every form of the word. If he doesn't know you, he doesn't like you and doesn't get to know you and Wahlberg plays it with perfect arrogance. Vera Farmiga holds her own on the screen with DiCaprio and Damon, but she is easily forgotten. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Ray Winstone add great veteran backup. Props to Marty. This is the best cast of the year.Martin Scorsese perfectly crafts this crime thriller. The cinematography, editing, and Howard Shore's pulsy score gives the film a deadly Boston personality. He perfectly paces this film and gives it dramatic tension and suspense at the right moments. On an emotional level, he shows what life on the undercover is like. Always having to look back behind your back can wear a person out.All in all, The Departed is a brilliantly acted and directed film. Marty's best yet.",10,1,2,1 March 2007
Munich," Spielberg's worst
","The story had potential and Spielberg dived into most of it. Maybe too much of it.Great performance by Eric Bana, but the rest of the cast does nothing except Mathieu Kassovitz, who has a great scene, in one of the movie's preachy scenes. Spielberg, a master of re-creation, doesn't fail here. His interpretation of the Black September is terrifyingly real, aided by Kaminski's camera-work and Kahn's editing.The movie runs too long. I usually don't have a problem with running time, but it tends to drag towards the middle. It's preachy also, which bored me more.Overall: 6/10 2/4 3/5 B-",6,2,11,15 September 2007
Sin City," Brilliant stories, acting, visuals
","Sin City is an amazing movie. The script was taken directly from Frank Miller's graphic novels, so Frank takes the credit for that. He, Robert Rodriguez, & Quentin Tarantino create a city that nobody would like to live in, but would love to visit for an hour or 2. Excellent visual effects & cinematography. Mickey Rourke gives an amazing as the tough guy Marv. Benicio Del Toro gives a great performance as the woman beating cop, Jackie Boy. Elijah Wood gives a great silent performance. Bruce Willis & Clive Owen give decent performances. The best out of the girls was Rosario Dawson as the prostitute leader, Gail. Gripping stories.Overall-A+",10,0,1,23 June 2006
The Island," Interesting plot and great action. McGregor is poor
","The Island is a good movie, It's a group of people in a Utopian world who are told that their was a large contamination on earth that killed off life. Every once in a while, people are chosen to go to the island, the last known uncontaminated place. A member of the society (Ewan McGregor) discovers the truth behind this situation and seeks to exploit with help of his best friend (Scarlett Johannson). The script is pretty good. It has a great concept and funny dialog every once in a while.Ewan McGregor gives a poor performance. His character is supposed to be child-like and he does that well, but his performance lacks small details that make it realistic. He also plays an actor in the film who has a key role in story. He does this with a bad Scottish accent. Scarlett Johannson gives a very good performance. She has limited dialog, but she plays her character quite well, and is brilliant on one particular scene. Djimon Hounsou gives a good performance as a bounty-hunter who has a change of the heart. Steve Buscemi gives a good comedic performance.It's a Michael Bay film so you the action and cinematography are top-notch.OVERALL: Other than the Ewan McGregor's performance, The Island is a highly entertaining.",8,0,1,7 August 2006
