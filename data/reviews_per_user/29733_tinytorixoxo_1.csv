The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Amazing
","Fan of the books or not, this movie was great. This one, like the previous, are action filled and suspenseful, making the movie even more enjoyable. Being a huge fan of the books I must say that they did an awesome job of following the story and all characters. I love the casting of all characters- Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson especially, they did amazing in all three films! If you watch this movie you will not regret it!But- if you haven't watched the first two films, you will definitely be confused so go back and watch The Hunger Games and Catching Fire first if you haven't already!!",10,3,14,12 April 2015
