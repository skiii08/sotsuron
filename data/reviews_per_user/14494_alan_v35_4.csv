3:10 to Yuma," Anyone else find this story impossible to buy???
","Well, I have never seen the original version of this film, but I trust it was more convincing than this. As a true western lover, I may have had expectations that were too high, but this movie didn't manage to win me over. The action is very well done, particularly the early stage robbery, and the characters are initially good, though Crowe's scripture-spouting evil superman-like outlaw leader never really rang true for me. This started out as a mild, nagging irritant that grew as the story unfolded. Crowe and Bale's performances are very good, and Ben Foster is good as 'Hand of God' (Great name) gunslinger, Charlie Prince, though his character is never developed beyond the superficial level. The story starts out strong but gradually lost me until its ending turned ludicrous and had me looking around to see the reaction of the rest of the crowd, but they appeared to be surprisingly engrossed in the silliness on screen.The story is about two men, the first of whom is Dan Evans (Christian Bale), whose ranch is being strangled by a greedy businessman. the second is an arrogant outlaw leader named Ben Wade, who Evans sees leading an attack on a heavily armed stagecoach. Shortly, the stunningly reckless Wade is easily captured. A plan is hatched to move him to a nearby railroad town and send him to Yuma Penitentiary, but Wade's gang presents a problem. Evans offers to join the transporting posse, in return for much-needed cash and the story is set. Some kind of Old West-style Stockholm Syndrome sets in and the rest....well, i don't want to blow the rest, but be careful not to give it any sort of thought.There is some excellent, and original (particularly impressive in this genre) action and this backed up by some interesting characters, but Crowe's characters' actions are so far-fetched, that the whole story collapses and will likely leave all, but the action crowd unsatisfied.This work was first published on realmoviereview.com",6,8,15,12 September 2007
Balls of Fury," Anyone seen Enter The Dragon?
","Ben Garant joined with fellow Reno 911!er, Thomas Lennon to write this comedy, before getting behind the lens for his first feature film, while Lennon took the supporting role of German champion Karl Wolfschtagg. However, the star here is Dan Fogler, in a Jack Black kind of role as a Ping Pong protégé turned has-been, Randy Daytona. The acting is fine, and it's always great to see Christopher Walken back on screen. The story is pretty much a by-the-numbers spoof of Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon, with some James Bond, Scarface and every clichéd martial arts film ever made. The script, the bread and butter of every comedy, is only passable, with more smiles and chuckles than laughs.Randy Daytona loses the 1988 Olympic Gold medal for ping-pong, and his father on the same day, and becomes a has-been haunted by his line, 'I'm going to Disneyland'. Daytona gets another chance when he is approached by FBI agent, Ernie Rodriguez (played by George Lopez), to go undercover at an underground ping-pong tournament run by the evil criminal emperor, Feng (Walken). After a gruelling training regiment under Master Wong, played well by veteran actor, James Hong, and his daughter, Maggie (Maggie Q) who looks great and has some very cool moves.This review has come out pretty positive, but, although there are some good characters and ideas here, there is a lack of really funny jokes and, really, in a martial arts spoof about ping-pong that is packed with more talent than Tiger Woods, it shouldn't have been that hard to get a few really good laughs.This work was first posted on realmoviereview.com",5,4,6,12 September 2007
Superbad," Porkys and American Pie have nothing on Superbad
","The teen sex comedy is back and in the fine tradition of countless, tasteless classics, Superbad picks up the fallen torch and uses the light from it to look for a way to get laid. The movie is not original or deep, but it is pretty damn funny. The young performers are great and actually look the parts they play and show some real acting ability. Hill is a regular part of the Seth Rogan mob that is ruling Hollywood comedies these days, while Sera is in his first big screen starring roles after years of TV work on Arrested Development. The real shock here is the teenager, Christopher Mintz-Plasse who is on-screen for the first time and is great.The story here is simplicity, itself. It's two weeks to high school graduation and Seth (Jonah Hill) desperately wants to share some carnal moments with a girl, preferably Jules (Emma Stone). His best friend, Adam (Sera) has romantic aspirations for Becca (Martha MacIsaac) and the key to these dreams seems to be Jules' party for which they have offered to come up with the booze  a tricky offer when you are three years underage. The key to their plan is the hopeless, Fogell, (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who has just bought a new fake ID, and gave himself an attention-grabbing new name to go along with it. The simple plan of having Fogell buy the booze and arriving at the party as heroes and stepping into the waiting arms of their intoxicated fantasy girls for an evening of new pleasures doesn't go as smoothly as they planned (obviously) and soon all three are off on a series of misadventures that include two police officers (Hader & Rogan), an armed robbery and a couple vehicle-pedestrian accidents.This movie is not for everyone. This is an adolescent comedy from the same minds that came up with the 40 Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. It's similar in mindset to Porky's and the American Pie series. If you enjoyed these movies, then Superbad will be a couple hours of groaning, giggling and loudly laughing at the high school antics that we were never dumb enough, desperate enough, or unlucky enough to engage in when we were in high school. Or so we claim, anyway.This review was first posted on realmoviereview.com",Null,1,6,13 September 2007
Blades of Glory," Well, it has its moments
","This movie is one of those Hollywood Cinderella stories that we hear of from time to time. Unknown Directors, Gordon and Speck, teamed up with a pair unknown brothers (Jeff and Craig Cox) to somehow land a project with star Will Ferrell and Napoleon Dynamite's star, Jon Heder. The result is a silly comedy, that is just as dumb as it appears to be, but is entertaining, nonetheless.Chazz Michael Michaels (Ferrell) and Jimmy MacElroy (Heder) are bitter figure skating rivals who are stripped of their gold medals and left banned from men's figure skating. Soon, they find a loophole that will allow them to compete in the pair's arena, much to the consternation of the ruling champions, Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Arnett and Poehler), who set out to disrupt their progress. Their coach (Craig T. Nelson) has a secret move, though. It's dangerous, but can min it all for themÂ…if they can just master it in two weeks! This movie has some funny moments with overblown skating scenes, though the gag about homophobic guys who are freaked out by physical contact with another man is played to death. Look for some cameos by a number of skating stars. This will be enjoyed by Ferell fans and others who don't mind comedies that don't recognize any limits on how silly a movie can get.This work was first posted on realmoviereview.com",6,0,1,12 September 2007
