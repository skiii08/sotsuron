Casablanca," hits the right spots
","this film is probably one of the best ever made, just somehow hits just the right spots all along, beautiful beginning, excellent plot, and an ending you'll never forget... so many quotes from this film are classics, the song is a must know, bogey is his charming self (here's looking at you kid ;-)) ingrid is extremely moving, the whole crew (yes they do look like the ones in the maltese falcon don't they) is just perfect",10,1,1,21 September 2003
Apocalypse Now," Redux ?! No thank you
","This is just to tell all you movie lovers out there that yes, apocalypse now is definitely a must see, but now, you don't have to get the redux version, really, I've seen both and although I'm not saying the redux film is bad, I must say it really doesn't add anything to the movie...Let's just say the 50odd minutes added are a waste of time : the original cut is unquestionably a master-piece, but the scenes with the play mates, the pathetic french colonialists or willard stealing the surfboard somehow don't fit in, at least not at the same level. But if you haven't got the choice you can still watch the redux version, you'lljust miss some of the magic I found in the original cut.",10,0,0,30 December 2001
The Game," well crafted, a good piece of american made action
","david fincher is probably more famous for his more recent works like fight club, but this movie is also up there amongst the very few enjoyable and interesting movies in the last 20 years. Very well crafted, a real thriller and no it's not like the boring old american plot, it really is different and worth watching no masterpiece but certainly watchable",8,0,1,30 November 2002
