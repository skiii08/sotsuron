Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a good beginning
",some people may say George lucas lays off the action a bit and its too talkative but remember this is the start of the saga the sith have been wiped out you would know if you'd have played any of the knights of the old republic games.i think that it's a good start we can clearly see that anakin is strong even though he's ten years old.the end lightsaber battle is great but with qui-gon gone is there really any point to have him in the movie?altogether a good start to the saga and special effects are almost there the podrace is really good it really builds up tension.we see a young but powerful obi-wan-kenobi and yet more of the future.altogether 8/10 a start that will be remembered in my DVD collection.,8,1,2,21 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," is it really a good addition to the star wars saga?
","i think the empire strikes back is really disappointing.did george lucas really need to add this to the saga.the only bit worth a mark is the lightsaber fight at the end and the dark secret.from the hoth battle its just a downward hill struggle up till the duel.its a good job i watched this in about 3 parts cause if i'd have watched it all together i would have fell asleep.i can never watch this all the way from hoth to the lightsaber battle.darth vader,emperor palpatine and Luke skywalker are the only characters worth a mention they are a good asset to the story.if it were'not for them empire strikes back would have skipped my DVD collection for ever.so 6/10 a really wasted effort to the star wars saga.",6,0,8,21 August 2005
