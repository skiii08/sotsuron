Saturday Night Fever," a 7 (or good on IMDb scale) if you like cheese
","So most of us know Saturday Night fever that are between 30 and almost dead. It has some iconic and often spoofed dance scenes. I wonder if the youngin's of the world today have heard of this movie or for that matter seen it. So is it a classic, well that depends on how you look at it. If you are shallow and have an insipid mind it is. If you are someone who likes to make fun of Disco and cheesy movies it is as well. I think, though I could be wrong, that I fall into the latter category. I enjoyed watching this movie not because it was good, but because it was just humorous to watch Vinny Barbarino in action, and I admit he is a good dancer. I found myself making fun of this movie while I watched it, but it is not terrible or undeserving like say the Blind Side (which I just reviewed), of being in this blog but just dated and just o.k. But there is that music by the Bee Gees that I am almost ashamed to admit I like, and the disco which along with the 80's are among America's cheesiest decades. So I recommend watching it to feel nostalgic, to see what the disco era was like if you are young, or just to laugh at a la mystery science theater 3000. Oh and look for a ridiculously hot very young Fran Drescher in the movie, marone that chick can get sausage stiff if yo know what I sayin' yo know what I am say sayin, ohhhh... marone, I think I just felt the thunder bolt (my attempt at being a stereotyped Italian from Brooklyn or I guess New Jersey as well).",Null,0,2,8 August 2011
Whip It," could have been good but sadly nope
","So I watched whip it from 2009, well some think it is good some not so much. Which camp am I in well the not so much one. I really wanted to like this movie, it had hot bad girls in mini skirts (so you can see their panties-what I am a man) being rough and acting tough, a killer soundtrack, an interesting story (based on a real league out of Austin Texas), and good acting, but in the end was just another predictable Hollywood movie for the most part. It suffered from a disease that I find runs rampant in sports films, it involves the main team going from last to first just like that, it involves the rookie sensation going through several personal trials often at the same time, a nasty rival team that shows respect in the end, and the big showdown to end it all. It is systemic and has infiltrated almost every sports flick I have ever seen, it even affects the movies that are spoofs of this very phenomenon. I honestly can't say whether to skip this one or not, maybe if the story had been more simple and had more grit it could have been a great freshman directing attempt by Drew Barrymore, but I was personally left feeling disappointed. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",Null,3,6,14 August 2011
The Secret in Their Eyes," sex, humor, mystery, redemption, murder, and love it just has everything
","So I saw 'the secret in their eyes' from 2009. S0 is it good, I say Si! This movie is from Argentina and enlightened me in ways that I never knew possible, chiefly that Argentina has a film industry. Once I got past this shocking revelation I was ready to watch the movie. So this movie won awards all over the globe including the Oscar for best foreign film, and literally every award offered by the Argentinian film awards (which suggests to me maybe Argentina doesn't have a film industry so much as makes a movie a year). This movie was one of the best I have seen in years. It has flash backs that are actually purposeful and not confusing. It has humor. It has suspense. It has mystery. It has not one but two great love stories. It has violence. And it brought me into the world of Argentina, a world I am not that familiar with other than the rumors that Hitler is secret living there. I loved this movie, from the first shot to the ending, that I thought would be all typical Hollywood bull crap, but surprised me completely and made me go 'hmmmmm.. I did not see that coming,' which is something I wish I could say more often with thrillers. This movie is a must see unless you hate subtitles. I can see Hollywood making a version of this and ruining it, so see it before Hollywood rapes and kills this movie. Oh and by the way that is the main plot of the movie (the rape and kill thing not the Hollywood thing) so if that makes you squeamish, that may be another reason not to see it. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",8,2,3,19 May 2011
Pirate Radio," walk the plank before believing this is good
","So I watched 2009's pirate radio inspired by the real life British pirate radio stations of the 1960's. Well was this movie good I have to say ehhhhh...it was alright. The best part about this movie is the soundtrack, but that is no reason to watch a movie, we all have ipods or pandora so why bother. This movie could have been good but it just tried to do too much and create conflict where apparently there was none in real life. This movie is directed by Richard Curtis who wrote or directed such schmaltzy girl crap like love actually, Bridget Jones Diary, and four weddings and a funeral. These are not bad movies per say but there just fluffy and so was this movie. If you like fluffy movies with ensemble casts then maybe you'll like this one to. Me personally I can stomach his movies but are not in ah of his talents. Stream line the plot, kill off a few characters so we can to know them better, kill the false tension and struggle, then re-shoot it and get back to me.",6,0,1,29 June 2011
Megamind," it didn't suck and I enjoyed it overall
","So I watched 2010's CGI cartoon flick 'megamind'. Well was it megagood, well for a kids flick I say it was good. Now as a flick just for adults it get's an ehh. However, if I had kids I could sit through this film and enjoy it which I did overall, and I think kids will love this movie. The animation is just standard fare here, nothing special but then again everything CGI to me at this point is wonderful, it just doesn't stand out here like it did in say 'rango'. The plot is interesting enough, two aliens crash on earth at the same time one destined to be a superhero and one destined to be a super villain, or perhaps not? The acting is solid and comes from some of the industries best Ferrel, Fay, Jonah Hill, David Cross, Stiller, and Pitt (hey my second review today with him). In fact, the character that Ferrel developed for this film was memorable, not Ron Burgundy memorable but good. It was interesting if I had to compare it to say 'the incredibles' it is not in the same league, but it is good for a kid's flick. And I said most adults with the exception of my best friend who hates anything that isn't completely obscure should enjoy this 'popcorn' flick.",7,1,2,4 September 2011
Horrible Bosses," a 7 or what I consider to be a good flick on IMDb if you remember not to think
","So I saw 2011's horrible bosses starring well a lot of famous people. So is it good, well that depends on a few things. So if you are looking for a really well developed story well this movie is horrible. However, if you enjoy mindless comedy, this movie is worthy of best picture. This movie is hilarious. However, that is about it. So did I like it well yeah, but I am also a huge fan of this type of film when it is done right. This movie in some ways reminded me a lot of (what I consider to be the best stoner comedy of all time) 'Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle.' In it three individuals, hate their bosses and want to kill them. So who are these individuals. Well my favorite is played by Charlie Day of one of the best sitcoms of all time, 'it's always sunny in Philadelphia.' He essential plays a smarter version of his character on that show, he even is a self proclaimed law expert in this movie. The second is played by Jason Batman who plays the same character he plays in every freakin' movie he is in for the most part. Hey Jason, you better ride that money train for as long as you can, because people are starting to get bored with the under appreciated executive you made famous in (another one of the best sitcoms of all time) 'Arrested Development.' Finally, the last killer in repose is played by Jason Sudeikis who plays an interesting character who is somehow competent and a good guy while being a very smarmy sex addict. The cast is rounded out by several greats all playing some really horrible bosses. We have Jennifer Aniston playing a Nympho dentist who is not afraid to sexually harass Charlie Day. This movie is worth seeing just for her alone and the chance to see her near naked body WOW! Then there is Colin Farrell who has the best comb over of all time, he is simply horrible, but in a good way. And then there is Kevin Spacey who is horrible but who is really over the top, which I didn't like. Finally there is I think a character played by.....well a cameo so if you don't know why spoil it (I know I was surprised). So this movie is basically character and joke driven. In this sense it is immensely successful, and should have very broad appeal. So go and just turn your brain off and laugh, oh and if you can manage to see it with the worlds most beautiful woman I highly recommend it. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",Null,0,0,19 July 2011
The Town," good if you can past the total B.S love twist
","So I watched 'the town' written, starring, and directed by the poor man's Matt Damon, Ben Affleck. I am not a huge fan of Ben Affleck, he has done some good work chiefly 'Good Will Hunting', but overall his work is more like the idiotic Paycheck (I have got to read the Philip K. Dick story it is based on it can't be as bad as the movie). So is it good, well yes and no. It is a brilliant, taught, suspenseful, well acted crime drama. It also has an interesting twist in that Ben Affleck's character falls in love with a hostage he takes on one of his bank jobs. However, what happens later in the movie is complete and total B.S. I am not going to say it, anyone who has read a review or two of mine knows I try to stay away from specific plot points and sometimes even the plot in general. I don't like to spoil the adventure. This movie is one of several recent gritty movies to take place in the bad part of Boston where apparently America's non hillbilly white trash settle down (read my review of Eddie Coyle). So this is a good movie, with one glaring unrealistic aspect, but if you can get past that, and if you like crime dramas you should like this movie. Kudos Mr. Affleck you are apparently more gifted than most of your film roles would lead the general public to believe. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",7,0,0,8 August 2011
Judgment at Nuremberg," one of the best films of all time
","So I watched the award winning 'Judgment at Nuremberg' from 1961, and directed by Stanley Kramer. So is this movie a classic, I say yeah! So not only is this movie a classic, I would rank it among one of the best films I have ever seen. This movie has twists and turns like a suspense thriller, but is very subtle in those twists and turns, they are neither obvious nor are they possibly even intentional. This film is brilliantly written, it is brilliantly acted, was wonderfully cast, and directed by a master. This film is both unflinching at times, and surprising at other times. These surprises aren't typical surprises in the traditional sense, these are the twists and turns you feel. Every moment you feel is building to some sort of sympathy by the head Judge played by Spencer Tracey for the German's particularly one of the defendants played stoically by Burt Lancaster, but he is pragmatic and unforgiving without being angry or vengeful in the end. I personally think his performance was better than Maximilian Schell's, which garnered him a well deserved Oscar. In addition to these brilliant roles, there are strong roles played by Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, and Richard Widmark. Additionally, there were roles performed by iconic characters of the small screen, by Captain Kirk in one of his first film roles, and Colonel Klink from 'Hogan's Heroes' (Werner Klemperer). So basically this movie is moving, surprising, exquisitely acted, wonderfully written, perfectly cast, classic in every sense of the word, and award winning. So yeah I think it is one of the best films of all time, even if you don't agree with that sentiment, I would be surprised if you watch this film and don't love it. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",10,0,1,14 June 2011
Salt," what is this 1988
","Alright one reader I am out of retirement. So what movie is so powerful it could drive me out of my golden critical slumber it is 'salt'. So salt is not critically acclaimed, it is not a classic in the making, and it is not an indy, what it is is a movie that sucks. I mean really sucks. Its premise, about a sleeper cell of Russian agents hell bent on bringing down America would have flown 25 years ago, but not now. The action sequences were laughable. I mean fine we are almost always supposed to believe people can do things in these movies that would kill other people but come on this Russian bitch jumped from truck to truck on a highway like it was nothing after jumping onto a truck from an overpass. One of the things I will always love about 'diehard' is that by the end Bruce Willis was so badly bruised, bloody, and beaten it was plausible that this man went through what he did. The fact that Angelina Jolie still had perfect makeup after this ordeal tells me one thing, people don't pay to see an ugly Angelina Jolie just ask the people who made 'a mighty heart', which by the way did not suck, this did stay away unless you don't mind a horrible plot, laughable heroics, and plot twists that leave you saying 'i saw that coming'!! if you like concise reviews of interesting flicks read my blog at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",5,2,5,8 May 2011
The Men Who Stare at Goats," as far as i can tell no where near as good as the real life tale it is based on
","So I watched the men 'who stare at goats' from 2009 starring George Clooney. So is it a good movie, well it could have been. I am going to add to the review after I have read the book, and seen the documentary it is in part based on by Jon Ronson. I read a lot of reviews before watching this movie, and got the sense that people in general liked it but that it eventually fell flat which is how I felt. I have seen some exerts from the documentary that came before the film and I have to say, that some of the weirdest stuff in the doc is also some of the weirdest and most unbelievable stuff in this movie. So should you skip it, well I will comment after the documentary and book have been completed but for now, I say if you don't mind watching a movie that starts out with a lot of potential but then dies suddenly towards the end go for it. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",Null,0,3,14 August 2011
Ratatouille," don't kill that rat he is the best chef in France
","So I watched 2008's Oscar winner for best animated feature film Ratatouille. So is this movie good, I say once oui, bon tre bon. I think this movie is an instant classic, and is one that does not just appeal to kids and most adults, but in particular to gourmets, which I am. This movie captures perfectly what it is like to be in love with food. It defines the dividing line between what is eating to survive and surviving to eat. About the only character I had a problem with is Linguine, which I didn't dig. The character didn't seem up to the standards of the others, and he does share the lead with Patton Oswalt's wonderful Remy the rat. Besides from that I literally loved every single second of this movie. From the beautiful animation, to the clever story line, to the interesting characters, it is one of the best animated films I have seen period. Some of the people who do voices may surprise you, not in the sense they are doing this film, but in the sense that I honestly (outside of Patton Oswalt) didn't know who did the voices until I looked it up, and was very surprised. This is particularly true of Janeane Garafalo who apparently doesn't have to sound like some whinny gen x'er who smokes too much all the time. Too sum things up, I have to say, any movie that can make rats cooking in a kitchen adorable, has to be good. Why? Because if you saw that in real life all the rats in this movie would be dead not cooking. So enjoy this flick maybe even make some ratatouille yourself, because as Gusteau says anyone can cook!",9,0,1,28 May 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," the must see movie for comic book video game players
","So I watched Scott Pilgrim vs. the World from 2010. This falls under the indy movie category for me, so was it good I say yes. I am getting older (not old yet) and though I have a wii, I am not video game dude nor am I a comic book junkie. However, this movie had great acting, an interesting premise, was well done and extremely creative, and very enjoyable from start to finish. My one complaint is sometimes it was a little too much. What that means exactly is it moved like a video game, fast and with constant activity and no time to breath. But then again that may be the point, but then again this is a movie, not a video game. This is a movie for hipsters,video game freaks, and comic book guys (and gals). The fight sequences are very refreshing and there is both great humor and several good love stories. This movie seems very youth oriented, but as I said I am not as young as I once was and am no longer this movies key demographic, and I had a blast watching it.

Lawrence of Arabia," wow
","So I watched the award winning Lawrence of Arabia from 1962. Well is it a classic well yeah that's an easy one. This movie stars Peter O'toole as the sexually ambiguous T. E Lawrence who led the Arabs to freedom in the early part of the last century. This movie was directed by David Lean who also won an academy award for 'The bridge over the river kwai'. What both these movies have in common is a grand scope and an eye for detail that is unparalleled in most movies. The movie has one problem it is 3 hours and 35 minute before the final credits start. It is only a big deal if you are planning to watch it in one sitting, but in general it doesn't play long. The long slow scenes don't play so because you really are brought into those seemingly infinite deserts and feel the struggle for survival experienced by the characters. This movie is about as well made as you can get, there is a fair amount of testosterone thrown around but this movie should appeal to both sexes. It is a true classic. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",9,1,4,22 May 2011
The Hurt Locker," boom goes the dynamite
","So I watched 2009's best picture winner The Hurt Locker, well was it good, well yeah. Was it truly the best movie of last year, well of the ones I have see I would give that nod personally to the surprisingly good district 9, but this movie was pretty damn good. I reviewed Jeremy Renner in 'Neo Ned' in which he gave an incredible performance, and though the acting isn't as good on his part here he does a great job. Katheryn Bigelow, does a really good job of bringing us into the world of someone in the grips of war in a very dangerous , very adrenaline related, profession, of bomb defuser dude. I liked the cameos by Lost's Evangeline Lily, and one of my personal favorites Ralph Fiennes (watch in bruge or red dragon if you haven't already). I liked this movie, and it is good. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",Null,0,1,8 August 2011
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Powerful ending, the rest not bad
","So 'I watched the boy in the striped pajamas' from 2008. So was it good, yeah it was good. Now was it great, I say no. So Vera Farminga won the BIFA for best actress, for portraying a German chick with an English accent, portrayed by a U.S born chick who only spoke Ukrainian until she was six. So I guess that's what got her the award, because that is kind of challenging. Other than that I didn't find her performance all that note worthy. As far as Nazi flicks I have seen better, namely in the form of 'Schindler's list'. 'Schindler's list' didn't pull any punches, making it one of the most powerful films of all time. But this movie is good. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. One of the problems I had was all of the German's spoke with British accents, which threw me off a little at first, until I realized they were Nazi's. The story itself is good and centers around a small boy who befriends the boy in the striped pajamas. I will admit the ending is very powerful, and in a tamer movie would probably have ended differently. The end in this movie is more than just the final act, it is what this film builds too, and I guess that is why I just liked it and did not love it. I guess what I am saying is if the rest of the film had been as unflinching as the end it could have been great. However, this is one of those movies I think everyone should watch, not just to form there own opinion of this film, but to serve as a reminder that humans in reality can be monsters far worse than anything with fangs or sharp claws. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",7,0,0,6 June 2011
Paranormal Activity," not too much of a spoiler really so read on if you dawre hahahahaha (evil laugh)
","So I watched 2007's surprise hit 'paranormal activity' starring two people I have never heard of before or since this movie came out. The stars are also the directors as this movie was shot on a single camera. The stars are Katie somebody and Micah somebody playing fictional couple Micah and Katie somebody. So in other words this movie isn't about the stars. So what is this movie about? Well let's not discuss plot but rather what this movie is. Well it is a horror movie of the best kind, minimal where the chills come from what we don't see. Often this fear of the unknown affects are own lives and I often prefer movies that reflect the heightened sense of fear we often display in the face of nothing to be afraid of. This movie is very similar in concept to 'The Blair Witch project'. Unknown actors are given a camera and imersed into a scary situation. However with this film there is a very structured plot and use of minor but highly effective special effects. The result is a movie which is very creepy. So I have waited to say whether it is good or not, well yeah it is good, and I think it could have been great. The ending is much like Blair witch, but unlike Blair Witch instead of just ending when the big horrible crescendo is reached, we are exposed to a coda which kind of ruined it for me. So it is good, it has broad appeal, and if you liked Blair witch you will probably like this movie. It is a really great flick, if unlike me you turn it off when you hear the final blood curdling screams. I know I wish had.",7,0,0,19 July 2011
Alice in Wonderland," pretty lousy for burton
","So I watched 2010's Alice in Wonderland done by the genius Tim Burton. So is this movie a flash of genius well, no quite frankly. Is this movie visually stunning, yes, is the plot any good well no. If I had tackled this project I would have been faithful to Lewis Carrol's original masterpieces and maybe made two films. However, I am not, I am a guy who will probably die un-famous and unregarded as a visionary director. However, I am right in suggesting why screw with a classic story and combine the elements of both books with elements that are original. If you look at Jackson's Lord of the rings trilogy, he may have changed some things but left the series as a trilogy and stayed true for the most part and that is why it works. Even a movie like 'No country for Old men' where the Coen brothers changed the basic premise of the original story to be about two men in a struggle, was still dedicated to the original story and dialog why because it is awesome, well the same is true for Lewis Carrol's endeavors written over 100 years ago. The story rocks and the dialog rocks so why mess with it, well the answer is don't, and that is why this movie kind of sucks. However, if you do lots of hallucinogenics check it out, once again it is visually satisfying. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",5,0,2,19 May 2011
Avatar," an instant classic
","So I watched 2009's Avatar well is it an instant classic well yeah. Is it the best movie ever no! So why a classic. Well this movie was the first really to fully utilize modern 3-d and has done it in a way that was very satisfying, especially since this review is based on my second watching in 2d. Also the animation is spectacular from start to finish. When I think of the artistry that goes into just one second of a movie like this my mind gets blown man. So why is this movie not the best ever, well several reasons but lets focus on some core things, one it is pretty predictable, two the story though original contains many not so original concepts. Well what does 'two' mean, well if you change the Na'vi to American Indians you have the plot to almost every movie done about the white man versus the American Indian. Also, if you replace the other main plot point, the need for a greedy nation to have power both literally and figuratively, you have the plot of any anti American movie dealing with the middle east. However, the Na'vi and their world are beyond interesting, and the incorporation by Cameron of both the sci-fi elements he has explored in the past and his love of 'aliens of the deep' make this a very satisfying ride. At the end of the day you have to remember this is basically a kids movie, so to look to harshly through any other lens is sort of off the mark. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",8,2,5,23 May 2011
Invictus," powerful movie great poem
","Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll. I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.That is one powerful poem I tell you. I know it inspires me, and it is one of things that kept Nelson Mandela going during his 25 years in prison. The film Invictus from 2009 directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Matt Damon is a good movie. Is it a great movie hmmmm.....well some of my biggest problems with the movie are things that actually are true, so I don't know what to think. I mean Nelson Mandela chooses a rugby team to be the symbol of cooperation and reconciliation after apartheid, and then shortly thereafter they host the world cup and he in part Drives the team to victory and gets the country to rally together black and white behind this one cause. Well I would normally say come on I can write better fiction in my sleep. However, it pretty much went down that way, so what can you do but heap another log on the grand fire that is the legend of Nelson Mandela. Morgan Freeman does a spot on Mandela and it helps they do kind of look alike. I liked this movie, I didn't love this movie, nor do I think it is a classic in the making, but with time maybe my mind will change. In any event I learned a really kick ass poem. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",7,0,1,6 July 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," not good for hipster adults but this is a kids movie for kids
","So I saw 'How to train your dragon', from 2010. So is it a good movie. Well the answer is no. O.K this movie is visually stunning, but with the evolotion of CGI, these incredible to look at movies are becoming common place. Also this is a kid's movie, and yeah if I was a small child I might think wow this is awesome, but I am not. There are movies which cross the divide between toddler and adult, for instance the original Shrek or even Shrek II (when the cops found a bag of catnip on puss'n'boots and he says 'thats not mine' is just awesome). Hell, I even loved all three toy story movies. Granted you could say I have a problem with the kids all having American accents, but even if I accept this because it is a movie, why do the adult Vikings talk with Scottish accents. Shouldn't they sound more like the Swedish chef from the muppets, now that's funny. This story will probably play over well with average people and kids. However, if you are an adult, and don't have a dragon fetish, this is just the same old story about how we don't always know someone, until we get to know them, and a monster is not always a monster. Unless I was planning to do some hallucinogens while listening to pink floyd, while this was on in the background, it is just not worth seeing. If you have a family or are not into truly interesting cinema maybe this movie is your cup of tea. If you are a hipster who enjoys movies like the original shrek, you will probably be disappointed. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",5,2,13,16 May 2011
Some Like It Hot," a true comedy classic and one of the best films I have ever seen
","So I watched the film classic from 1959 'some like it hot'. Let me describe the movie in simple terms; what happens when you take a pure B movie plot, add great dialog, superb acting, and near perfect direction from a Hollywood legend, well you get pure comic gold. This is one of those movies you hope they never remake. It is now more than 50 years since this Billy Wilder gem was made and its stands the test of time. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are perfectly cast as two down on their luck musicians who are on the run from the mob. They take a gig as female band members in order to get out of town and hilarity ensues. The dialog between them is fantastic and they sell every line that would probably be real cheesy if delivered by almost anyone else. Marilyn Monroe is well HOT. This is my first Marilyn Monroe movie and well I get it now. I always saw pictures of her and said o.k shes a babe but, man there really was just something about her. My favorite lines in the movie are in the very last scene. I won't spoil it for the possible one person who reads this someday, but man I almost peed myself. If you haven't ever taken the time to see this movie do it, unless you are made of stone I dare you not to enjoy this comic masterpiece. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",Null,1,1,4 September 2011
Hoosiers," this movie sucked so bad simply OVER RATED!
","I expect this review will be a bit controversial to some. I am going to say something that some of you will agree with and well will outrage some as well. What is this magic word that will divide the hopefully two people who see this at some point before this blog disappears, well it is 'OVER RATED !!!!!!!!!'. I hated this movie. I thought the very 80's theme music sucked, I thought Dennis Hopper who got an Oscar nod for this over acted. I thought the love interest angle involving Barbara Hershey and Gene Hackman was obvious. Every thing from the towns people hating newly arrived basketball coach 'Gene Hackman' , to the local phenom stepping up to the figuritive plate just at the right moment, to the incredible and subtlety racist ending was obvious. Have you said the phrase 'this thing just writes itself' well the chuckleheads who got the green light to do this must have uttered that constantly as they wrote this piece of garbage. Oh and by the way I know I forgot to say it earlier but 'hoosiers' is an Oscar nominated film about a basketball team that wins the big game in the 1950's and was made in 1986. You can skip this one 'over rated' 'over rated' 'over rated'!",Null,2,8,4 September 2011

Well before I answer that let me say I am not opposed to watching the odd popcorn big budget bonanza, but as my blog states, I shoot more for quality overall than just great special effects. So my girl had free tickets and that is why we went. So did I like it? Well if you don't take it seriously it is kind of funny, something I hoped legendary Kenneth Branagh (who directed this film) intended. Oddly he was a perfect choice for this film considering the Thor planet parts with Sir Anthony Hopkins play more like Shakespeare. Is it really good, no. Is it worth it to see it in 3d, no. Some movies like avatar are meant to be seen in 3d, where it is much more than a gimmick. This movie if you see it in the theaters, save the cash see it in 2d you won't be missing anything. Otherwise the special effects are great, and the acting is not horrible. I kind of thought of it as a modern day 'flash gordon.' It is a little cheesy, a little over the top, but if you find it funny it is enjoyable, just don't tell anyone I said that. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",6,0,2,13 May 2011
The Blind Side," come on America let's demand more from our movies
","So I watched the Blind Side last night, well was it good well no. This  movie is the flip side of this blog. One side is to hopefully find  other movie geeks like myself, and create a forum for introducing good  movies to one another. The other is to discredit those that are  supposedly good but lets face it are not. So why would I watch a movie  I normally would not watch. Well, it was Sandra Bullock's academy award  winning performance of course. I looked over the list of past winners  from 1980 on, and one thing stuck out whether the performances were  memorable or not they all came from good flicks. This thing seriously  felt like a made for TV movie. I think the Michael Oher story is truly  incredible, and the family that adopted him just incredible, when I see  pictures of the very white, very rich, and very southern Leigh Anne  Toughy with this enormous black man from the wrong side of the tracks I  admit it brings a tear to my eye. This movie as of the day I wrote this  review has a 7.7 on IMDb, which on their scale is up there among the  best. Each of these reviews is obviously one mans opinion but come on  people, if we continue down this path of calling movies like this good,  America may someday become no better than one of the f'tard nation of  this world. Come on America we can do better, there is better, please  do not allow Mediocrity to become the new gold standard. Come on  everyone U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A, say it with me and burn this movie and  melt that statue Sandra Bullock won. Oh and the kid who played Michael  Oher actually did a good job of acting, where is his award.",6,2,4,6 June 2011
Rango," liked this film but then again i am in it
","So I watched Rango from 2011 and starring Johnny Depp. So was this movie good, I say yes you bastards, sorry I tend to curse when I channel the voice of Dr. Duke. I am perhaps a little bit biased in my assessment of this film, I do have a very brief cameo in it. Look for me in the beginning I am driving the Cadillac with my lawyer in the back seat. This is a kids film, but fortunately it is one of those films the adults can enjoy as well (the fact that I am in it should tell you that). The story is very predictable and has been done a million times in a million movies. We have a fish out of water (well lizard), who pretends to be something he is not, gets caught eventually, but comes back to both redeem himself and save the day and of course gets the girl. However, it is the original take on this premise as well as the subtle deeper thoughts that this movie touches on that makes it good. It also is one of the most beautifully animated films I have seen yet. I heard this movie is spectacular in 3D, which is something I would not doubt. So this movie is well shot, well written, and well acted, it has great and original characters, and in general is really good for a kids movie. I will say this critters die in this flick something I was not expecting in a kids movie. But then again it is not graphic and we are talking about birds and other such critters so unless your kid doesn't understand why grandma can't come over for the holidays anymore, don't worry about your kids watching this film. Most people should enjoy this film it is very enjoyable on many different levels and as I said visually stunning. So go watch enjoy whatever your personal movie preferences are. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",7,1,1,7 August 2011
Despicable Me," not good after say age 8
","So I watched 2010's CGI cartoon Despicable Me, starring, the not so great since 40 year old virgin, Steve Carell. This movie is not good plain and simple. The animation is solid, but that is all I can say that is positive about this film. This is not of the caliber of the toy story franchise or ratatouille. O.k so that being said am I this movies target audience, well no this is for little kids. And I would not doubt little kids will love this film. Will a lot of those kids grow up to watch it again someday when they are older and say 'why did I like this?', yes I think the ones who got past the third grade will! Oh, and if you are an adult doing hallucinogens there are better movies to trip to, not that I would know anything about that, it's just a suggestion. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",5,0,5,6 July 2011
Mary and Max," great flick
","Mary and Max is a suberbly crafted film released in 2009, and is written and directed by Adam Elliot. To start with this film is Austalian, but takes place in both Australia and New York New York. Next, and most importantly I loved this movie. It was poignant, deeply moving, visually stunning and made you laugh, cry, and think. What more can you ask from a film. This film is somewhat intellectual and takes on some very difficult subjects while having the look of a Wallace and Gromit cartoon. It is beautifully narated by Barry Humphries who is most famous for his Dame Edna character. It also has wonderful supporting voices from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Toni Collette. This is not a mainsteam film and if I find a following, I would hope they maintain a higher standard for their movie watching experience and seek this film out. I can rave on and on about this film, there was not one moment where I did not find myself completely enthralled. If you like great movies which I hope you do, please don't overlook this glorious treasure. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",8,1,3,9 May 2011
Fantastic Mr. Fox," this is cussing good
","So I watched Wes Anderson's adaptation of the book The Fantastic Mr. Fox, so is it good I say unenthusiastically yes. It wasn't great but it was good. Once again I have not read this book, but as a child read other Roald Dahl books and loved them. So why without enthusiasm, well I guess the story doesn't seem to go anywhere I guess. The end was the end, and that is about that. I liked how every 'cussing' cus word was said as 'cus', something cute for adults that still made the film a 'kids movie.' I also liked the ravenous eating habits as well as the animation technique. I have enjoyed all of Wes Anderson's films including 'The Life Aquatic' (though marginally in that particular case), and I saw elements of his unique visual style translated into animation. The acting is good with an award winning cast, and the movie is very watchable for children. I am a big kid so I liked it, but I did not love it and do not think this film is for everyone out there, and think even amongst the intellectual sect there is probably much disagreement as to the worth of this film. However, it is worth watching and is in the end enjoyable to do so. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",7,0,1,6 July 2011
The Sixth Sense," a true classic
","So I revisited the sixth sense today. I can't think of too many people who haven't seen this flick at this point, but there is a whole new movie watching audience growing up right now that may have never even heard of this 'classic'. So the first time I saw this movie I didn't know the secret, but I knew there was one and figured it out about 10 minutes into the film. If you are young and don't know why someone just said 'I see dead people' this movie is where that great line came from. This is also in case you don't know, pretty much the only film M. Night Shamalan did that isn't crap (I also liked unbreakable). So was this movie as good as I remember, well it was even better. I didn't spend the whole movie trying to solve a puzzle so I think I was able to really enjoy what a good story this is. For all you youngins' out there in the year 2100 who come across this as an archive, well for one greetings from beyond the grave, and secondly check out the sixth sense it's awesome. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",Null,0,0,21 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," go be nerdy if you have seen the other films you won't be disappointed
","So I watched the mega blockbuster finale to the Harry 'the nerd sorcerer' Potter saga 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' from 2011. So was this movie good, I say abracadabra bitch, or yes in muggle speak. I have seen every Harry Potter movie and enjoyed them all. I especially like how the movies (and I guess the books to) have matured with each passing film. They also went from somewhat structured like in the sorcerers stone to less predictable and original as time has passed. I saw this last one in IMAX 3D, I personally found the 3D to not be mind blowing, which I think is common among films not shot in 3D. So if I was you I would save the cash and see this in regular boring ole' 2D. So this movie just like the others is a little dark, has fascinating characters, a mystery to be solved and mysteries to be revealed. This movie delivers these Harry standards in spades. This movie was enjoyable except for the final scene for me. I won't spoil it but it is taken from the final books epilogue. It seemed tacked on and kind of pointless. I personally think much like star wars we have not seen the last Harry Potter film. I see the next one coming in about 10 years after the next Harry book by Rowling comes out called 'Harry Potter and the quest to find something else to write that failed and the search for more money.' I think the next one should be R with a little graphic interracial (muggle on wizard) hardcore action. So this movie is a worthy ending to the series, it answers all the questions, has a wide demographic base from young to old from magic nerd to jock. So go enjoy and be nerdy for a couple of hours, but just don't start here these movies for the most part should be watched in order. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",7,0,0,7 August 2011
Get Him to the Greek," really a 6.5 on the IMDb scale almost good but not quite
","So I watched 2010's raunchy comedy 'get him to the Greek'. So was it good, I say ehh.. it started good. This film stars Russel Brand who I personally think is hilarious, especially when he appears on talk shows. He is an odd ex drug addict, who is sexy and looks like a rocker, so he is perfectly cast here. It also stars P-diddy as a record label owner a role he is well suited for. Additionally, it stars Jonah Hill who is very finny, and several supporting roles all done well. This movie starts awesome. It has sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll, all with raunchy humor and an interesting take on the classic road trip theme used by movies. However, the third act doesn't just feel weird and out of place it also feels awkward. The film comes back together by the final sequence, but by then I at least lost interest. This movie is geared more towards stoners, raunchy comedy fans, and the youth of this world. If you are not part of this demographic you will probably not care for this film much, and if you are, you may find yourself rolling on the floor in laughter until the third act when you may find yourself saying 'what?'. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",7,1,3,26 June 2011
Easy A," Amanda Bynes will you marry me, this has nothing to do with the review just putting that out there
","So I watched 2010's 'easy A', starring the current 'I'm a smart complicated actress see I have brunette hair' chick, I mean Emma Stone. So far I have seen her in other movies playing basically the same character, such as 'zombieland' (which I liked) and 'the rocker' which gets an enthusiastic ehhhh. So is this a good movie, I say no. However, though I think the movie is much worse than I am going to admit, I am going to do a first and see this movie through someone else's eyes. I am going to think of this movie's target audience, chiefly mildly interesting and intelligent girls in their mid teens to early thirties. This movie got some pretty warm reviews from both people on IMDb and critics. I didn't like it, I could see how this movie could have been good but just not to me. The parents played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are the best part of the movie. They are the kind of parents I hope to be someday. They are warm, funny, and have an open honest relationship with their kids. The relationship between Thomas Hayden Church and his wife played by Lisa Kudrow is interesting and complex. I even appreciate the multiple homages to John Hughes and other 80's movies that are similar to this one. Overall though I just didn't say wow. But that brings us back to the target audience. Look if you are a female in the age range listed above (and even outside of this range( you will probably like this movie regardless of personal possibly esoteric movie standards. If you are someone enthralled by 80's teen movies you might get a kick out of this. If you like barely legal hot chicks and dudes playing high school kids you might satisfy your personal fetish. However, If you watch only weird indy flicks or a lot of action/thriller movies, you will either hate it or be like me and say 'my life isn't better or worse for having seen this and I didn't try to commit ritual suicide during it, so ehhhhhhhhhh; but really mean eh (which is not as good as ehhhhhhhh.)",6,0,1,22 May 2011
The Great Escape," da da da da da da da da da da da (sing it with me)
","So I watched 1963's 'The Great Escape', starring dead people who include Steve Mcqueen. So is this movie a classic, well I say yes. If you watch this movie you may find yourself saying ohh.. that's where that came from (in reference to any number of movies and TV shows that have paid homage to this movie including say the Simpsons). The whistled theme is just awesome something I have whistled since I was a kid. The movie is true to the original true story. It is very well acted. Exciting from beginning to end, and does not have a happy ending (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Well why not because sometimes it is more about the journey in life than the destination, and the creative forces and sheer will of these men to escape from their German captors makes for great movie watching. I say see it young or old, male or female, this truly is a classic. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",9,0,1,8 May 2011
The Runaways," you would think a hot rock chic movie with great music would be awesome
","So I watched the movie 'the runaways' based on the book by Cherie Currie and released in 2010. So is it good, I saw ehhh. It is really for me a 6.5 on the IMDb scale, a movie between 6.5 and 7 on this scale in my opinion could suck could be good, it depends on what you like, but doesn't have that magic something that makes most people say that was pretty darn good, like say another Dakota Fanning movie called 'Man on fire', which is awesome. It is an indy film and one that got some critical praise, but for me it was just o.k. This really sucks, I wanted to love this film because well it is a rock chick movie, with a very hot make-out scene involving a young Dakota Fanning (who is growing up before our eyes) and that depressing vampire chick Kristen Stewart, truly awesome music including the stooges and the sex pistols, and well in general sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll. So you think with that pedigree it would rock. And at first this movie did, but then it just got sort of boring (even with the drug abuse) toward the middle of the movie and just stayed that way, flat. The acting is pretty good, and the casting of Michael Shannon as Kim Fowley was perfect. If you want to get a sense of the real Kim Fowley watch a good documentary called 'Mayor of the Sunset Strip' about Rodney Bingenheimer, who played a role in the runaways career as well. Some might find this movie awesome, and I would not discourage someone from watching it and forming their own opinion, but when I hit pause to go do the dishes when there is a f'd up Dakota Fanning in lingerie in front of me you know there has to be something missing. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",6,0,4,19 May 2011
The Social Network," over hyped just like facebook but still good
","So I watched 2010's most over-hyped film 'the social network'. So was it good, well yes, was it as awesome as advertised well no. This film has quite a pedigree Oscars, David Fincher, Aaron Sorkin (not a fan, I personally think all his characters speak with the same tone, just watch Sports night to get an idea of what I am talking about), and universal critical praise. I personally liked this movie but did not love it. It is a fictionalized version of the truth, a truth that is still the present for the most part. I personally don't see what is so great about facebook. I have an account, but most of the time when I log on I see someone 'likes q-tips', thanks for sharing. But it is fascinating that this genius named Mark Zuckerberg, basically took being socially awkward, having a chip on his shoulder, and programming skills, and turned all that into a company that is somehow magically valued at around 25 billion dollars (another thing that I just don't understand). Zuckerberg apparently did all this while he sacrificed friendship, and screwed over a couple of uber twins to become the king nerd. This film does give us some sense of the basic story of how someone became the world's youngest billionaire. It is also interesting, well acted, and has broad appeal. However, just like facebook itself I think it is overvalued, over-hyped, and may very well be more of a fad than a classic. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",7,0,0,26 June 2011
Up in the Air," another great one from the son of a comic genius
","So I just watched 2009's Up in the air, was it good well yeah. It was directed by Jason Reitman son of Ivan Reitman who gave us some comedy classics and gave us some real stinkers as well. His son has given us in his relatively short career this movie, Juno, and Thank You for Smoking. So I can picture this kid being in his dad's world and learning from it, being inspired by it, and taking it to the level his dad hasn't. What I mean is I love Stripes and Meatball's but Jason's movies are much better and in this case deeper than his father's work. I have to think his dad is proud of his son. This movie had great acting from America's sweetheart George Clooney who is embracing getting older, and the rest of the cast including Vera Farmiga. It was deep without being obvious about being so, comical, and enjoyable to watch from start to finish, this is one of those movies that most people can find enjoyable. If you are intellectual you look for deeper meaning, if you are average you laugh and enjoy the ride. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",Null,0,3,8 August 2011
