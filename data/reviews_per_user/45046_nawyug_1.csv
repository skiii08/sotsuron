Captain Phillips," An ordinary movie with Extraordinary acting..
","I am a die-hard fan of Tom Hanks. So i was planning to watch this movie for last 2 weeks. I had to skip my office to watch this one and i was not disappointed.It is always difficult to make a movie on true incidents because there is very less freedom a director can take. This one is no exception. But It was the Paul Greengrass's direction and Billy Ray's screenplay which makes it possible to convert it in an interesting movie.It is a story of Captain Phillips, Captain of a cargo ship , navigating it through the horn of Africa. As a Captain he is well aware of the dangers of these waters. And he was not wrong.This movie starts like a normal Hollywood movie. In starting it's a bit slow pacing. The Background sounds, camera angles, military operation scenes are very ordinary and we have seen them in many crisis movies. But the acting of Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi makes all the difference.Tom Hanks is, as always, extraordinary. His acting is so natural that we forgets Tom Hanks... and only remember the Captain throughout the movie. Last 20 minutes of the movie are awesome. We can feel the inner-self of the caption and that is certainly because of Tom Hanks. As a pirate's group leader Barkhad Abdi has done a great job.In all other departments the movie is an ordinary Hollywood movie. But this movie is a must watch if you don't want to miss the best acting of Tom Hnaks after Castaway.As a whole, i would like to give Captain Phillips 10/10 rating.",10,0,1,6 November 2013
