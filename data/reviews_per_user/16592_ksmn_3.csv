Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It All Begins Here
","This movie is a great beginning to the Star Wars saga. Here we view Anakin Skywalker (Darth Vader) as a young boy, Obi-Wan as a Jedi apprentice, and the state of the Galactic Republic prior to the Emperor's becoming unquestioned ruler. The events in this film ultimately will of course lead up to the Galactic Civil War, but probably only Yoda and some of the other Jedi have a clue about Anakin's future role.Basically this story is about how they find young Anakin Skywalker and discover that the Sith have returned. The status of Anakin's childhood certainly must have affected his later life. People who grow up in slavery and are separated from their parents by strangers they barely know can become aggresive people in their adulthood. I thought the portrayal of his life on Tatooine was great!My main complaint probably is that midi-chloridians, which are interesting in their own right, doesn't sound appropriate for a Lucas movie. Since when has he based an element of the Force on school biology?",6,0,1,27 May 2000
Toy Story," Great Animation, Great Characters
","This movie probably was the best kids' movie I've ever seen in my life. Its animation was superb and Tim Allen was very funny as the voice of Buzz Lightyear, an action figure who really thinks he is the space hero he's supposed to be. The rest of the characters also had great things to say. 'That's not flying, that's falling with style!' was an unforgettable line.",10,0,0,20 December 2000
Toy Story 2," Special comment
","I am talking about the 'dancing Barbies scene' which I believe was inspired by <i>Valley of the Dolls</i>. I just want to comment that this probably was the strongest 'sex reference' in a Disney cartoon, not counting Jessica Rabbit's behavior. I mean, traditionally Disney characters never get sexually attracted at feminine bodies. On the other hand, it is debatable how those seven dwarves exactly felt about Snow White.Of course I enjoyed it. After all, I remember finding Barbie dolls in friend's houses and taking the clothes off.The rest of the movie was pretty good, including Buzz Lightyear's space hero dialogue which I've always enjoyed.",Null,0,1,10 October 2001
