The Blair Witch Project," Ignore the hype
","*SPOILERS* Ignore the hype surrounding this film.  It is a good piece of work for the small budget used in making this film.  I will not go as far as saying it is the scariest movie of all time...but it definately has its moments.  One thing that made me enjoy this film is that I kept thinking to myself, 'What if I was in their shoes?'   Would I be scared?, 'Very much so!!!'  One scene that sums it up is when Heather ask 'What if it is somebody messing with us?'  Michael (I think it was him), replies, 'I don't wanna mess with that'. Heather then ask 'What if it is not a person?'  Michael replies 'I don't wanna mess with that either!'  My point is even though they never see the Blair Witch, as far as their concerned at the beginning of the film, it is just a local legend, they get freaked out by forest noises and stick figures as the film progresses with each passing day. It would still creep you if it had been you, no matter how tough you think you are.  That is the 'point' of the film.  Forget the hype and view it with an open mind. 8/10.",Null,0,0,5 November 1999
