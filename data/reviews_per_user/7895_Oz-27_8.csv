Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Darth Maul and Jar Jar steal the show.
",I saw TPM on sunday and I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. This movie lacked any human feeling what so ever. There was so many creatures that i thought i was watching Muppets in Space. I did enjoy certain aspects of the movie though. The music was awesome. Darth Maul's theme was great. Darth Maul was a cool villain(too bad he gets barely any screen time). Jar Jar Binks was also a funny addition to the cast. This movie does not live up to the first three. Go see it if you're looking for cool effects and a bad story.,7,0,0,24 May 1999
Sleepy Hollow," The Best Film of the Year
","Sleepy Hollow proves once again that Tim Burton is one the greatest directors alive today. This should be considered a true masterpiece not only for him but for the history of film. If he doesn't get any recognition for this movie i will be really shocked.Sleepy Hollow is a more gorier re-telling of the story of the Headless Horsemen. Icabod Crane(Johnny Deph) is sent to the town of Sleppy Hollow to find a killer who severes his victims heads and takes them. At first icabod doesn't believe in the horse-man until he sees him for hisself. He also meets a young girl named Katrina(Christina Ricci) who he becomes very attracted to. A lot of things follow and this becomes one of the best movies i have seen in a long while.The acting is really superb in this film. Johnny Deph is my favorite actor as of now. He is the most versatile actor in recent memory and he is always willing to take chances. he should really get something for this film because he trully brings icabod to life. Christina Ricci is also good as the innocent Katrina. She is one of the best younger actresses in hollywood and this is one of her best performances.Tim Burton again, i bow in your prescence. He is a true visonary and fora lack of a better word a cinematic genius.The Music is also superb. Danny Elman is a wonderful composer. i really loved the music in this film. i smell an oscar in the air.All in all a great film that left me speechless 10 out of 10",10,0,0,26 November 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," One of the best Teen films of the year!
","I saw 10 Things i Hate about You with my friend Novia and she cried throughout most of the movie. I thought the film was funny, Had great acting, and had a good story. My friend Novia read The Taming of the Shrew and said the moving was a good adaptation.The acting was good. Julia Stiles( The 60's) was good in the film. I hope to see her in more films. Larisa Oleynik( Secret World of Alex Mack) was very funny and she should continue to chose roles like this one. Heath Ledger was also good. I haven't seen him in anything else, but he was really good. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Andrew Keagon shine in Supporting roles.Backed by a cool soundtrack, Ten things i hate about you will not be forgotten",10,0,0,14 August 1999
American Pie," Has a huge gross-out factor, and the misuse of apple pie.I LOVED IT!
",This movie has to be the most hilarious teen film of all time. Funny performances and snappy dialog make this a cool movie experience. The best thing about this movie is that it cast un-known actors and was able to make this movie a huge hit.The performances were great. Jason Bigs stands out amongst all of them. He blends funny dialog with very funny physical comedy. I hope to see him in more films in the future. Alyson Hannigan who has a small but funny role is also great. She says the best line in the movie. ( you have to see it just to see her say that line)The actors worked exceptionally well together and I really enjoyed the film. Go see it.,10,1,1,14 August 1999
The Lion King," Best Disney Film Ever. Also the darkest
",The Lion King is the most intriguing and most interesting Disney movie ever made. I thought the story was great and that the chracters were just fantastic. Also i would like to point out this is the most serious Disney movie ever made in my opinion. I think this has to be one of the first Disney Films to appeal to kids and adults at the same time.Seriousness of this film is shown throughout the film. Scar is the jealous brother of Mufassa and he desperately wants to king. He later kills mufasa and takes the thrown. i feel this one element sits it apart from other Disney Films. it also focuses on serious issues and it handles them really well.Everyone who lent their voices to this film are great. i thought that everyone brought their characters to life.The Soundtrack is also good. The score is the best ever in a disney Film. Also this film has the most memorable songs out of all of the Disney films. This movie is a triumph. A solid 10,Null,0,0,4 December 1999
Scream," Good Horror Film
","When i first saw this movie i was amazed immeadiately by the first 10 minutes of the film. Never had i seen so much suspense and scares that early in a film. This movie is a thrill ride from beginning to end. Clever and Witty dialoge, great actors, and a clever script by Kevin Williamson make this film a must see.The acting is great all around. Neve Campbell is very good in the film. Unlike some horror movie characters you actually feel sorry for her because she is so convincing. Courtney Cox is good, but even better in the sequel. David Arquette is always funny. But the standouts are Skeet Ulricha nd Matthew Lillard. Loved their performances.Backed by a good score and Soundtrack, this film is well on its way to becoming a classic.",9,0,0,16 August 1999
Halloween," Defined the slasher genre. A true classic
",Halloween is my favorite horror movie of all time. very creepy and terrifying. I'm scared out of my shoes everytime i see it. The music is so haunting and suspenseful with a sinister tone that you will never forget.Jamie Lee Curtis gives a good performance in this film. i loved her character in this film. She was smart but very naive at the same time. Donald Pleasance was good as michael's doctor who knows that 'Michael will come home to kill'. Backed by very good supportng stars this film is just great.I also have to say that the last 10 to 15 minutes are the most tense and scary minutes in horror movie history. Almost all slaher films have tried to imitate the big chase scene at the end but this will always be the best. The ending is a shocker also. **** out of ****,10,0,0,5 November 1999
Any Given Sunday," Awesome Movie
","I really enjoyed Any given sunday. i thought that it portrayed the world of football very realisticly and it showed how that people in charge of sports teams in general sometimes have differences of opinion and most of the time those opinions clash.Any given Sunday begins during a game when the sharks star quarter back(who is on the verge on retirement) is injured during a game. after this tony damato, the head coach, sends another player in who is also injured. next he sends in willie Beaman, who throws up everytime he is brought out on the field. At first willie is rusty but in future games he becomes better and he even becomes extremely cocky. so cocky in fact that when the teams are in huttles he changes the plays. Tony doesn't like willie disobedient attitude but, christine, the owner of the team doesn't care how you win as long as you win, her nature of winning soon clashes with tony's more traditional ways and soon everyone is at each other's necks.even though this film is really long your nver bored with the film. The football action is wonderfully directed by oliver stone. the football scenes are very intense and as a director he succeeds in making all of them intense.The acting is good from everyone on board. Al pacino is excellent as the head coach. he's a very intense actor and he can make the most out of every scene he's in cameron Diaz is the big surprise among the cast. as the teams owner, cameron diaz, bites down into this role with fury she is very good at playing it mean and bitchy. you can tell she was having fun with the role. jamie foxx proves that he can do more than just comedy. he is very good in the role and also a big surprise amongst the cast because he also turns in a very nice performance. LL Cool J has become a great actor as well. he is great in this and i'm glad he's doing good in his films.All in all a good movie and very entertaining. B+",8,0,0,13 February 2000
