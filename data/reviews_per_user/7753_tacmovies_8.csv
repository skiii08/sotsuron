Changeling," Confessions of a JMS-aholic...
","I'm going to break from my usual format for the purpose of reviewing this movie. From Captain Power to the Real Ghostbusters to Babylon 5 to his run on the comic book Spider-man, J. Michael Straczynski is not so much my favorite writer as he is my writing God. So, when I heard that a major motion picture, written by him, was being produced by originally Ron Howard, then Clint Eastwood and that A listers like John Malkovich and Angelina Jolie were going to be in it, not to mention Jeffrey Donovan, the star of Burn Notice, were going to be involved in it, I was excited and nervous beyond all hell. I'm not really a sports fan, but the feeling I had is the way I think a fan feels when they find out their home town team is playing for the World Series or the Superbowl. I was excited because JMS was finally going to break into Hollywood. I was nervous because, well what if it sucked? I mean, I loved JMS's work on TV shows, but while the Babylon 5's made for TV movies weren't bad, they were nowhere near as good as the show itself. I was worried that JMS might not be able to pull off a movie. Furthermore, a lot of hands end up touching movies before they get produced. I wanted to see my home town team win, not get humiliated. So, I was nervous.Also, I was confused. The movie was called Changeling, which to me, the Star Trek nerd, is the alien species that Odo from Deep Space Nine. I couldn't believe for the life of me that all these A-listers signed on for a sci-fi movie, despite the fact that JMS had made his name writing sci-fi. Then I heard it was based on a true story. This confused me even further.But, all my anxiousness didn't stop me from being a one man advertisement team for this movie. I bugged and threatened and bargained with all my friends to go see this one when it finally came out. In retrospect I think some of them might have decided to skip it because I was annoying them that badly.Well, the movie came out... and it was amazingly good! I mean, I know I'm a JMS whore, but it really, really was awesomely good. The cast was awesome, the visuals were awesome, the music was awesome, everything about it was freaking awesome, and the writing was beautifully, magically awesome! My only minor complaint with the movie is that JMS may have been too faithful to history and might have shortened the end by combining a few scenes. But, seriously, this is definitely my pick for best movie of 2008, and probably ranked number two or three of the decade, following Finding Neverland and (500) Days of Summer.

10 Things I Hate About You," A Time Capsule of Stars
","Story: When updating Shakespeare, a strong story is virtually guaranteed, and this one doesn't let us down. It remains true to The Taming of a Shrew but doesn't feel terribly locked into an era. It should still be enjoyable in 20 years. A Acting: Everyone brings the goods. Ledger, Stiles, Gordon-Levitt, and Oleynik all give memorable performances. A Direction: It's almost shot like live theater, in that the takes are long instead of the usual quick cuts that get associated with modern cinema, and it works, largely because the actors were strong enough to make it work. B Visuals: Nothing terribly memorable here. The dialog was the star of the movie and the visuals weren't bad, but they also weren't awesome. C Overall: This movie is a lot of fun and it captured many stars in their younger years. Julia Stiles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt have all gone on to make names for themselves, and this will be a testament to the fact that they've always been good. Heath Ledger fans should remember Heath as Joker and as Patrick Verona from this movie as I feel they are his best performances and they showcase his range as an actor, as Verona and Joker are so different that it takes a careful eye to notice that the same man portrayed them. You should see this movie and I give a B overall.",8,0,0,18 December 2009
2012," The Feel Good Comedy of the Year!
","Story: The movie starts in 2009 Platt and Ejofor informing a president of these United States who is curiously not Barack Obama in this world (weird... but at least he's a messianic black man right? Between this and Deep Impact, Hollywood is definitely telling America that we should be thankful to get through the Obama presidency in one piece, because the message is clearly the if you have a black president the world will try to kill you... not the political world... THE EARTH ITSELF WILL TURN ON YOU!!! If you liked that joke, it was mine. If you thought it was racist and offense, then my roommate Joseph came up with it.) that the apocalypse is about to begin and that like Noah, we need to build an ark.Speaking of Noah's, did anyone else notice that Jon Cusack's son was named Noah? What do you mean it's not symbolic? Although I can't come up with any reason why the digital television conversion didn't happen in this universe, as there are analog TV's without converter boxes functioning. Maybe there's some hidden symbolism there that I'm not getting.Some complaints with the storyline (SPOILER ALERT): If the tectonic plates decided to shift and the continental US began to sink, then who thought that landing in Hawaii to refuel would be a good idea? I'm not an expert and even I recognize the stupidity of that idea. Then we get the laziest deus ex machina in the form of the plane crashing from lack of fuel conveniently in China because of the shifting poles.(SPOILERS ALERT CONCLUDED, YOU MAY OPEN YOUR EYES NOW) All in all the story gets a B.Acting: There really are some good performances here. Danny Glover does an awesome not Obamessiah president. Woody Harrelson surprised me by even being in this movie and doing crazy in a way that only Woody can do. I'm glad to see Oliver Platt in something big again, even if he is the 'bad' guy (although if I had been in his shoes, I wouldn't have opened those doors either!) It's good to see John Billingsley on something other than Star Trek: Enterprise. Stephen McHattie was only on screen for a few scenes but completely stole those scenes. Oh, and the nuclear family plus the step dad aren't bad either. The acting department gets a solid A.Direction: Roland Emmerich gets a lot of crap for his movies and I'm not sure why (except for Godzilla and to certain extent The Day After Tomorrow which I thought were lesser movies of his) but, as my friend Andrew pointed out in my original review of this movie, the fact that Emmerich keeps dealing with apocalyptic subject matter does technically make him an auteur. Overall, there are some scenes where the audience really has to suspend their disbelief, like when Jon Cusack outruns a volcanic eruption and catches up with a plane on foot, but they work from a suspense point of view. However, I do have to fault Emmerich for a few of the plane take off scenes feeling identical to the one that just preceded it in the scene before. Of course, the band Austrian Death Machine might say, 'Of course they look and feel the same, because they all look BRUUUUUTAAAAAL!' B Visuals: If you haven't watch the Escapist's Movie Bob's review of this movie, I recommend you do so. He assessed the visuals in this movie in a far superior way than I ever could, so I'm not even going to try. Suffice to say, the visuals get an A.Overall: I laughed all the way through. . . and yes, I know this means that I should probably be seeking therapy. In my defense, everyone in my party was laughing too, so if there's something wrong with me, my friends have it too. This movie is close to A range, but really is more in the realm of B because of dumb things that drag it down, but regardless you should see this movie!",8,0,2,18 December 2009
Avatar," It's Soooo Beautiful!
","Visuals: For years Star Trek, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and all sorts of other sci-fi or fantasy movies have been trying to take us to another world. This one succeeded, and it was so beautiful. I swear that I had a religious experience in reaction to the visuals to this movie, probably akin to the feeling that many people had when they watched the original Star Wars for the first time in theaters. I don't tend to get teary eyed over physical beauty that often, but this world moved me to tears from the sheer beauty of it. It was like stepping inside an expressionistic painting. If you get a chance to see this in 3D, do it! If you get a chance to see it in the theater, do it! If you miss out on all that and watch your DVD in an old tube television, well... still watch it, although you might not have quite the same reaction as everyone else. The visuals get an A, and I somehow feel that an A isn't high enough to do this movie justice.Sound: If the sound had failed, then the visuals would have too. Pandora sounded alive and organic. The creatures made sounds that matched the visuals and the music superbly added to the drama of what was going on. A Acting: I tip my hat to every actor in this movie. The humans interacted with the CG characters in such an organic way that I really never questioned the fact that the humans were reacting to no one. Sam Worthington, mixing this with his roles in Terminator 4 and Clash of the Titans, may be establishing himself to be the next big action star since Jason Statham. Likewise, Zoe Saldana's career is on the rise as she just came off playing Uhura in the Star Trek reboot. And then there's Stephen Lang... good Lord, I do not want him angry with me under any circumstances ever. The man was ripped in this movie and looked like he could give Chuck Norris a run for his money. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing a movie with Stephen Lang portraying a character very similar to his role as Col. Miles Quaritch, but as the movie's main protagonist instead of villain. The acting department gets an A! Story: Normally, I tackle story first thing in my reviews. I saved it for last here, because I really loved this movie, but that doesn't mean that I'm blind to some issues with the storyline.My initial review was too long for IMDb, to read my full review visit tacmovies.blogspot.comAnyhow, this is the archetypal mole goes native story. There are some shocking similarities between it and the novel Call Me Joe, and it wouldn't be the first time that Cameron had been sued for plagiarism, as Harlan Ellison sued him over Terminator, but I still think that simultaneous creation is possible in this instance. Regardless, the story is pretty good, but it's definitely the weakest link in the chain. All of the characters played their parts in making this story function, but I definitely thought some parts were written a bit shallow, for instance (SPOILER WARNING): 1. The Na'vi never once thought that Jake was giving intel to the humans? I think tvtropes.com might call this 'Plot Induced Stupidity,' especially when you consider that they only let him stay there to gain intel on the humans. Slightly hypocritical, if you ask me. Since we're on the subject, Neytin turned on Jake and immediately never wanted to see him again before the humans attacked and her father died. This despite the fact that the Na'vi mate for life and the two just mated. After taming a red dragon-like creature, she welcomes him back with open arms.Okay, this functionally works to progress the story, but I think a better progression would have been to have the two mate, Jake reveals his mole status and the rest of the Na'vi turn on Jake but Neytin, feeling that strong, irrational mating bond, stands by her man until her father dies, at which point she turns on him. Jake then tames a red dragon and symbolically regains the trust of the Na'vi but it takes a little longer for Neytin to forgive him. At least, that's how I would have done it.2. The evil human corporation is willing to massacre innocent natives to make a quick buck. It's so one dimensional that it's painful. Not to say that it couldn't happen, but I wanted more, and I think the movie hinted at more. In fact, Worthington's character mentioned that the earth had been ruined somehow. If we as a race no longer had a home world and were dependent upon Unobtainium to survive, and the Na'vi were unwilling to negotiate giving us any Unobtainium for over six years (which the movie stated was the timetable the negotiations had gone), then I think stealing it wouldn't necessarily have been the right thing to do morally, but necessary for the survival of the human race. The story hints that this is what's going on behind the scenes, but never says it outright probably because we the audience would turn on Jake Sully if we knew that. In any case, I would have preferred that the storyline be less cut and dry. The soldiers just started shooting. They didn't try a covert mission to steal the Unobtainium first, and the money grubbing corporation didn't recognize the potential money to be made in harvesting the forest's telepathy/soul bank? Again, I thought the writing was okay, but with some major problems. C Overall: You should see this movie. It's awesome. Yes, the writing is a bit shallow at times, but it's still really good in spite of the writing. A",10,28,43,7 January 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Good Acting, Average Story
","Acting: Robert Downey Jr. is awesome at any role, and I'm glad that he's finally getting the recognition he deserves. He does a great job of making Holmes quirky and borderline unlikeable at times, but he just has this innocent sort of charm that makes us like him. Jude Law plays a great Dr. Watson. I have to agree with Moviebob in saying that it is nice to see a Watson that isn't played dumb or flat so that Sherlock looks more interesting by comparison. Rachel McAdams... was hot! She's an excellent femme fatale-ish sort of gal and seriously, she should be more famous than she is. Between Mean Girls, the Notebook, Wedding Crashers, and her best role (in my opinion) Red Eye, she really should be a household name by now. In many ways the actors were the main attraction in this movie and the banter between Jude Law and Downey made this movie. A Visuals: This movie had a great steam punk look to it and was generally a feast for the eyes. The fight scenes where Holmes would plot out each of his moves and the anticipated counter move was an item of beauty. Now, since I deleted my direction category in favor of a sound category, I'll attack the director here: This movie needed to be shorter. At least by ten minutes, probably closer to twenty minutes shorter. B Sound: The music was quite epic and, again, there were no foleys that kicked me out of the movie. The general sound of steam being released fit the whole steam punk atmosphere. B Story: Eh... I really don't like mystery movies or books as a genre. There are exceptions, but as a general rule they just don't pull me in. To the masses, they're good for maybe two viewings, once to try and figure it out as it plays out and another to check and make sure the writer didn't pull a fast one on the audience. The goal, I suppose, is to make the audience try to solve the mystery with Sherlock Holmes. But, all movies are to a certain extent a fantasy instead of reality, so logic goes out the window when the writer uses lots of supernatural elements or applied phlebotnium to drive the plot, making any real world speculations on our part a general waste of time. Hence, I never even try to solve the mystery and never get pulled in because of it.All right, enough about the genre, how's this particular mystery? Well, it's okay. I cared more about the banter between characters than solving the mystery, so I thought they could have cut a lot of the clues and speculations segments and gotten the running time down some. It would have made me happier. The villain's overall plan was good, but I think that a suspense thriller approach of letting the audience know his plan but not Holmes would have kept me interested when I tuned out, but I prefer thrillers over mysteries any day. C Overall: It's not a bad movie, and it seems to be fairly faithful to the Holmes mythology (even if he is a bit more physical than he ever was before... but I only read The Hound of the Baskervilles, so my knowledge of Holmes is limited to what my roommate, Robert, who read every Sherlock Holmes story ever, tells me) and ultimately it doesn't matter. This movie creates its own continuity and seems to stay consistent. I recommend this movie to fans of the players involved (Downey, Law, McAdams) and say that it's probably worth sending between five and eight dollars to see, but anymore than that might leave you feeling ripped off.

The Blind Side," It Made a Non-football Fan Care
","I'm going to preface this review by saying that I did not want to see this movie. Why? Because I hate football and because I watched Michael Phillips and A.O. Scott write it off as cheap, overly sentimental Oscar bait. I ended up seeing this because my mother wanted to see it for her birthday and I planned on taking a nap it the theater.Well, Mike and Tony, you were wrong. This movie was awesome. Freaking awesome. Again, I hate football and did not want to like this movie, but I loved it. So, I no longer record At the Movies. You two are heartbroken, I know.Story: The story follows the true story of Michael Oher as he was adopted by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw. He bonds with them and comes to see them as his own family. He gets his grades up, excels at playing football, and gets to go to college on a football scholarship. Then, the family gets put under a microscope by an investigator who wants to know why Sandra Bullock adopted Michael, suspecting that she did it so that her alma mater would have a powerhouse football player rather than out of a sense of charity. It is that last part that makes this movie so good, because we live in a cynical society where we want to know what the charitable are gaining by being charitable. It doesn't dodge that question.The only possible complaint I have with the story is that, under the correct viewing, the story could come off a bit racist. It inadvertently asserts that white culture is superior to black culture. The generous white people save one poor black kid from the horrors of living in a black world. This could have been subverted some by having the ghetto not be uniformly black and the white world being so uniformly white. However, being a true story, maybe that's how it happened. In fact, it does sort of come up as a plot point when Michael writes in his journal about feeling isolated by being the only black kid in the school. So, I don't think the movie was trying to be racist, but I do think some people will be offended. B Acting: Sandra Bullock's character came under fire by Scott and Phillips as a one dimensional idealized characterture that didn't grow throughout the story. They were particularly harsh on the line where Sandra said that Michael was changing her life, arguing that she showed no signs of that. I disagree. She was growing, but very subtly. Yes, she was headstrong and stubborn and changed very little, but she did grow, and if she hadn't been so persistent then this story never would have happened.Quinton Aaron also fell under fire, saying that his portrayal of Michael Oher was reduced to reaction shots and that he became an ancillary character in his own movie. Again, wrong! Yes, Michael doesn't say much, but he said everything that he needed to say through those subtle looks. Quinton did a fabulous job.Jae Head made this movie a lot of fun with his enthusiasm through playing SJ, Sandra Bullock's biological son who immediately bonds with Mike. Even the most jaded cynic will be smiling during SJ's scenes.Lastly, I knew Tim McGraw was in this movie and I kept wondering which character he was playing. I was shocked, absolutely shocked to learn that he had been playing Sean Tuohy, Sandra Bullock's husband. He disappeared into the role utterly, totally and completely. I had no idea that it was him until the end credits rolled and then I kept wanting to see his character again to see if it really was him, but instead the movie ends with photos of the real life Michael Oher and Tuohy family. Props, Tim! You were able to match energy with Sandra Bullock and were awesome! Acting gets a big fat A! Visuals: This movie did a good job (perhaps too good considering the potentially offensive racial message it sent) of making Michael's world and the Tuohy family world seem completely different. One is soft and pretty, the other is dark and gritty. The football action drew me in, an accomplishment when you consider that I don't enjoy the sport. All around, the visuals get an A.Sound: The soundtrack felt a bit southern, but it fit the movie and the mood they were trying to send. The foleys kept me believing that there really was a football game being played and didn't kick me out of the movie at any point. A Overall: This movie is really good. It's uplifting and generally gives a feeling of hope for the future. I hope no gets too terribly offended by it, but by and large I think you should see it. A",10,2,5,7 January 2010
1408," This movie actually scared me a few times!
","Story: This movie does a perfect build of creating anticipation in the mind of the audience, mainly through Jackson's constant warnings about room 1408. We're caught between saying, 'Don't go in there, stupid!' and, 'But I'd really like to know what's in there, since it's been built up so well!' Sometimes, Cusack's character comes across as a bit dense, but if he didn't then we wouldn't have a movie. B Acting: John Cusack does a great job of portraying a man who has given up on his life and is simply living and writing for a paycheck. He then convincingly grows as a character without being cliché about it. Samuel L.Jackson is Samuel L. Jackson and awesome because of it. A Direction: This creates an atmosphere of anticipation in an expert fashion. In terms of quantity, there are very few scares in this movie, but those work and work well because of that atmosphere. A Visuals: If the visuals hadn't worked, the direction would have failed in this movie. I think the best scene visually would have to be the scene of Cusack in the (SLIGHT SPOILER... BUT IT WAS IN THE TRAILER) snow filled room attempting to communicate with his wife through his laptop. The image is distorted and hard to make out when his avatar starts talking without his prompting, telling his wife to come to room 1408. The shot of his possessed avatar looking back at him though the LCD screen with a slight smirk on his shadowy face is probably one of the most effective visuals I've seen. A Overall: I've read far too few Stephen King stories, something that I'm trying to rectify, but the most recent movies based on his stories have been absolute gold, and this one is near the top of the mountain along with The Mist. You should see this movie. A",10,0,0,18 December 2009
300," This is CAKE TOWN!
","Story: Not much to say. It's the classic story of the 300 Spartans, retold in the style of the Frank Miller graphic novel. It's perfectly adequate to showcase the awesome fights and visuals. Nothing earth shaking here, but it gets the job done. C Acting: Gerard Butler is one of those truly great actors that disappears into a role to the point where you sometimes don't recognize that he's the same actor from movie to movie. He is great in this movie and deserves the lead role. David Wenham and Stephen McHattie are also really good in their roles. Overall, acting gets and A.Direction: Zach Snyder is very quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. This one isn't as good as Watchmen but it's still very, very good. A friend of mine didn't like the movie, describing it as being 'very, very gay.' She was using gay to mean that it showcased lots of very pretty, muscular men acting as masculine as possible, not gay as in a generic insult from the 90's. Now, as a man who identifies himself as being a 2 on Kinsey's scale of sexuality, I don't see this as being a bad thing. Besides, there have been quite a few movies lately in which the only positive thing going for them would be lots of hot women in skimpy, skin tight outfits, so I see the pendulum swinging the other way as a positive. B Visuals: What can I say about the visuals beyond that they're truly awesome? This movie has some of the best sword play I've ever seen. The switches from slow motion to regular speed create an epic effect of showcasing just how fast these guys are moving but also allowing us to see the details of their movement. A Overall: This movie is lots of fun. It's not realistic at all and doesn't try to be. See it, unless you're a history major who would be offended at how historically inaccurate it is.
