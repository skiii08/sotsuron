The Avengers," Goes Beyond the Ridiculous premise
","If somebody were to tell you that there's a film featuring a man in a metal suit, a guy who wears the American flag, a demigod and a green monster, wouldn't it strike you as silly? Oh and it gets even better, there is a man with an eyepatch, a guy with a bow and arrow, and a flying fortress.Well with all that put together it still is one of the best superhero films I have seen. When I found out that Joss Whedon, the man who made Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was set to direct, I knew the film was in good hands. It was unbelievable how he managed to regulate this ensemble cast, I felt like nobody was cut short of screen time. The plot was actually pretty solid, the characters had weight and the action didn't sacrifice much of the plot.There is one thing I am very glad the film didn't do: put in Ant-Man or Wasp, then it would have been too ridiculous.",10,2,6,6 May 2012
Skyfall," Bold, emotional and still a Bond film
","Daniel Craig isn't a traditional actor to play Bond therefore his Bond films aren't traditional either (yes even that abomination Quantum of Solace).Even though Casino Royale is the best of the Craig series, it lacked the certain Bond clich√©s we all love. Here we actually have some throwbacks in this reboot franchise. So there is something for the die hard Bond fans.The dialogue in this film is fantastic. Very organic, sophisticated, the bickering between Bond and his superiors and his colleagues is there, and we actually hear 'Bond. James Bond'.The characters in this film are solid and multi-dimensional. We get introduced to a young Q, who actually does more than just introduce gadgets. Tia Dalma (I forget the black chick's name) plays Eve Mo- ahem a fellow agent and you actually like her and the sexual tension between her and Bond. M here is a huge part of the story. She no longer is just the MI6 director who barks order and tells Bond off, she's one of the foci of the story. There is a really beautiful woman who's another Bond girl, but I found this one sort of forgettable. Like well into the film I forgot about her.And the villain. Wow his mullet was the most menacing thing I've ever seen. Javier Bardem plays Silva and as you can tell from the trailer he's a former agent. He's not a villain with a Machiavellian scheme, he's just out for (an elaborate sick, twisted) revenge. He's a great villain and he doesn't require a Persian cat or a hollowed out volcano.The story is much more dense here. Bond is given a lot more dimension like Dalton's. Unlike Timothy Dalton's Bond, he still has a deadpan sense of humour though. In the first two acts you get a general Bond film. In the third act however it becomes incredibly emotional.The ending of the film will remind a lot of people of Hard Target and Home Alone, this wasn't intentional but it happened. Nonetheless it's a very different kind of climax, and its refreshing to see one that doesn't take place in a villain's lair or submarine etc.One thing that will strike you are the visuals. Each shot has a rich blend of colours. The cinematographer and director were very meticulous here, job well done. I guess it's because the director's the guy who did American Beauty. So for those of you who knock digital film, well there you go.50 years into this series, and I'm pretty sure Ian Fleming would be proud.",10,6,16,9 November 2012
Iron Man 3," I am never watching another Iron Man film ever again
","OK severe spoiler warning impending. There will and there are a lot of fanboys who are incredibly outraged myself included.First of all as a film it was genuinely decent. It was the only Iron Man film with an actual driven plot which is loosely based on the Exremis graphic novel, unlike the completely filler 2nd film. In fact its the plot that made me stay in the theatre, which in itself is complex enough for a 2 hour long film. Basically Tony is dealing with post traumatic stress and insomnia after the events of the Avengers. So with that he becomes a workaholic making his suits with more artificial intelligence. And he has to deal with the threat of the Mandarin, a terrorist who has become a threat to the Americans.Now I was fine with not making him Chinese or East Asian. I was fine with him not coming face to face with Tony Stark liked he did in the comics. I was even fine with not making his rings magical even though we're in a post Avengers universe. Here was this bin Laden like figure who was incredibly menacing but ....HERES THE SPOILER He was not real. Nope. He was an actor hired by Aldrich Killian as a ruse, to put a face to the villainy. Except it used one of Marvel's most iconic characters. Never mind that Killian was breathing fire or Iron Man wasn't actually in person when he saved the passengers of Air Force One, this is what really got me heated.And its not even in the same vein as Batman Begins where it turned out that there's a real Ra's al-Ghul. You do have Killian saying 'You wanted the Mandarin, I am the Mandarin!' while he's spewing fire and sporting dragon tattoos, but well.... no. Killian being the Mandarin is analogous to your parents being Santa Claus, yes he did do those villainous things but he is not the Fu Manchu sporting long coat wearing arch-nemesis of Iron Man who's been in the mythology for almost half a century.I understand that filmmakers are entitled to some artistic liberties but to take it to the point to negate the existence a character thats was ranked among IGN's top 50 comic book villains, what was the point of all that buildup? In the first film his presence was really hammered in with the Ten Rings and all the Genghis Khan talk. I do know that the portrayal of the Mandarin has varied from a bad ass to a complete buffoon (lets not forget Modok) but... that is the same for any comic book villain including the Joker (*cough* Ceasar Romero *cough*).I honestly wanted to walk out of the theatre after that big twist but I felt like this film still deserved my full viewership (and I didn't want to waste $11) as it still was a good film let alone. If you are not a die hard fan of the source material, you would really enjoy it.Like Cracked.com said, comic book films are now in decline. I still look forward to Man of Steel because it genuinely looks like it's a good movie actually improving on the source material.",1,3,6,3 May 2013
Fight Club," An enigma
","This is another brilliant existentialist Y2K work of art. This is not just a movie but it is also a huge puzzle. Mostly you, the audience, have to piece together the entire thing. This film used really unique visualizations. And may I say this has to be the best plot twist ever made. If you watch closely there are several clues that point to that crucial moment. However you happen to ignore of those clues because of the bare knuckle brawling and because the story happens to go through the narrator's perspective (and maybe even the soap). I really liked the details the narrator used throughout the entire film. Along with the Matrix you will never see a film that really gets you thinking.",10,0,2,30 June 2008
Memento," Nolan's Best Film
","I always do reviews according to some connection with another film coming out the year I do it. In other words since TDKR is coming out in a week (I got tickets to it in IMAX!), I would like to go through some of Nolan's films. I consider this (and so will many) to be his best.The Batman films and Inception were brilliant as well but they were made with large budgets. Low budget films tend to be more focused. They use clever filmmaking techniques, a non-ensemble cast, and tend to let the story keep us captivated.Most of us know the story. It follows a man, Leonard, who can't make new memories, who tries to find his wife's killer using Polaroids and information tattooed to his body.It's presented in a non-linear format. The events are given to us in reverse order giving us a sense of the Leonard's condition. When the events unfold you truly get to see what his intentions are.This is what makes it Nolan's most thought provoking film. The thing with Inception and The Dark Knight is that their issues don't have much gravity when they take place within an established fictional universe. Memento is very much grounded in reality. There are people who suffer from anterograde amnesia and the film portrays it very accurately. Ask yourself: If you could not make new memories, if you could only store certain pieces of information about your experiences but not all on some tangible object, how would YOU come to define yourself? What mistakes would you choose to learn from? How would you choose to feel guilty? This was just part of a string of existentialist films that came out during that two year time span from 1998 to 2000 but it's by far Christopher Nolan's magnum opus.",Null,0,2,12 July 2012
Iron Man 2," Passed the sequel challenge
","First things first how did this sequel one up itself from it's predecessor? Continuity: The film takes place 6 months after Stark reveals his identity in the first film and the entire plot is driven because of that.Characters: Downey Jr. is back and his freestyle acting yet again is what brightens his screen time. Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodes, which really didn't bother me that much because personally I think both Cheadle and Howard are brilliant actors. War Machine will not disappoint. Mickey Rourke plays Ivan Vanko who is a hybrid of the Crimson Dynamo and Backlash and this character should have been given more screen time. Paltrow comes back as Pepper and her ability to keep up with Downey has improved. If there is no Mandarin for this film at least they got Justin Hammer another well known foe who I think should have been the villain of the first film. Scarlett Johansson plays the Black Widow, pretty much that is a character for the male audience. And Sam Jackson plays Nick Fury.Action: It had a lot more bad-assery (hope that's a word) than the first film, a lot more. However it wasn't presented like that in the trailer, which therefore I was sort of hesitant to expect greatness. If the trailer was presented like the A-Team thats coming out this year or the first Spider-Man film eight years ago then I would have bought my ticket way in advance. But don't be mislead, there is a lot of action sequences.",9,4,6,8 May 2010
Star Trek Into Darkness," I would be lying if I told you I wasn't impressed
","J.J. Abrams to me has now become sort of interchangeable with Joss Whedon. Both filmmakers made good television shows, wrote mediocre scripts in the 90s and now directed really good films which are immersed in fan fiction.Now I am a Star Wars fan, so I never really was into Rodenberry's... stuff. So yeah I prefer light sabers over phasers. I know bits and pieces but not anything like the Klingon language.I do know that the even numbered films are way better than their odd numbered counterparts and this still makes the case. The first film was OK, but it was mostly set up and the villain was a generic Romulan.Here the villain was, and lets be honest here they weren't fooling anyone, is Khan played by elongated faced British man. A white Khan, but nonetheless Khan. However its a more densely layered story, so there is another villain played by RoboCop who wants to start a war with the Klingons. And Iron Man 3 should take notes. What they did with the two villains was brilliant, with Khan initially forming a loose alliance with Kirk and then ascending as the main bad ass. So instead of lame cop outs, you have one take out the other and go hard.And I was completely blown away by Spock. In the third act, he actually showed emotion! And he was able to match himself mentally and physically against Khan, and I would be lying if I said that I didn't get overjoyed when he used his Vulcan death grip. But sadly he wasn't able to pull off that classic line by Shatner: 'KHAAAAAAN!'.Now this film had some things that weren't necessary. The prologue sequence didn't really drive the plot, it was meant for purely for some establishment of characters. The conclusion was also very abrupt. There was constant use of pans, Dutch angles and lens flares. And that gratuitous scene of the blonde chick in her lingerie, really? Are you that desperate to get prepubescent teens? That still is very well compensated by a really well paced film and a very great plot in which only a percent of the elements are contrived for fan pleasing. It's now guaranteed that Abrams will make an awesome Star Wars installment.",10,4,12,21 May 2013
Green Room," Who knew that punks vs. Nazis would make for one of the most viscerally intense thrillers ever
","Let's get into a little background here first before discussing the movie itself.Like the director of this film, I am a huge fan of the hardcore punk (or more simply hardcore) genre. I am a fan of bands like Black Flag, Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Agnostic Front, Sick of It All, Cro- Mags, Gorilla Biscuits, Suicidal Tendencies, Dead Kennedys and the more recent metallic incarnations like Madball, Hatebreed, Earth Crisis and Vision of Disorder. In short, it is characterized by frenetic instrumentals and shouted (and later screamed) vocals. It is not a well known genre as I have a very difficult time finding anyone who knows about it let alone be into it. It's a shame because it has come to define modern day rock and metal music as the genre has influenced very well known bands like Metallica and Nirvana.I have been to hardcore shows. Because of the lack of basic popular support, hardcore bands are pretty poor and perform gigs in small, dark, dingy bars where they are right next to the audience moshing. Hardcore as a genre has attracted a wide array of audiences of differing ideologies: the straight edgers, the skaters, the vegans, Hare Krishnas and even, unfortunately, Neo-Nazis.And that is the film's premise. A hardcore band that gets booked into a gig for neo-Nazis and they witness a murder which leads to them being held captive in the green room. As a thriller, the premise is quite original. And its not really a battle of ideologies between the parties. Yes you have punks and skinheads but both sides are just trying to get through an ordeal as we see with Chekove and Picard. But also as a thriller, its pretty clich√©d. The so called protagonists don't make the best decisions when dealing with their captors. But that is OK, since the film wasn't trying to be subversive in that manner. Where it was really effective in was its violence and gore. There was one particular scene that really affected me profoundly. One character gets his arm savagely mutilated and his fingers broken where the makeup was uncanny. It showed all the deep lacerations and the bone sticking out and the camera did not cut away from it, making the audience collectively gasp. Now I've seen enough violent films, but the acting that accompanied that scene of the character reacting to his situation really unnerved me. Usually in hyper- violent films, the violence has an almost comic tone. Here it didn't. And I swear, this is very true, I passed out momentarily. This is a thriller that is not meant to put you on edge. It is mean to really put you off balance and make you insanely uncomfortable. This movie is not for anyone with a weak stomach, as I figured out the hard way. We as film audiences have become so fascinated with violence but have never seen a film that lets us soak in the realism. Believe me, If I am to watch this film again, I need to down a glass of whiskey or something before doing so. Yea I'm just gonna watch some cartoons to offset this experience.Well there you have it. This review went from hardcore punk to ultra-violence. I still hope whoever's reading this has a listen to the bands I mentioned at the beginning. Really hardcore is actually very positive music albeit loud and unclean.",9,6,14,1 May 2016
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," lol XD....
","Good thing I went yesterday when it was half price for each ticket. I was bored at home, I just wanted to do something with my friend. I wanted to put my brain to rest while remaining awake. Never expect much out of a big budget film that was based on a video game. Like Pirates of the Caribbean, you could expect randomness mixed with a moving plot. Some of the action sequences do pay homage to the video game but I can't help but think it also borrowed some sequences from Assassin's Creed, hmmm. Don't expect any historical accuracy, in fact I wanted to see some opening text that said 'In a time when the Persian empire was at its peak, there were mosques even though these Persians were pagan, and everyone spoke in an uppity British accent...' instead there was something about 'destiny'. I had fun, me and my friend enjoyed some good laughs during some cheezy moments. Oh and it wasn't Jarhead that stood out it was Dr. Octopus. Alright. See Ya.",6,2,5,2 June 2010
Ted," Family Guy humour actually works on live action
","I laughed pretty hard throughout the entire film. So that should tell you it's worth watching.So yeah straight to the point, I had no clue that Family Guy's humour could actually translate so well into live action. The cutaway gags, pop culture references, the non sequitors, the New England backdrop it all works here.The character Ted to me is a cross between Peter and Brian Griffin. He's like Brian because he's this little fuzzy thing you're not supposed to take serious but you do. And he's like Peter because, you know... the voice.The film doesn't revolve around Ted as much as it revolves around Mark Wahlberg's character and his relationship with Mila Kunis who are both very likable.If you like Family Guy or just have a really good sense of humour this is for you.",10,5,15,6 July 2012
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Another harmless entertaining flick in the MCU that Sony should be happy with
","See Sony you get to have your cake and eat it by giving Spider-Man back to Marvel. I haven't done a review in a while because I get really defeated with typing my thoughts out and there ends up being a lot to say. But this film was a pretty shallow entertaining flick brought to again by Marvel.And like an MCU film it hits those same beats, frenetic action sequences, a rich colour palate (a huge step up from the Webb films by the way), tons of cgi, and ohh the incessant humour.Overall I liked this film, but I wasn't so excited about this like I was as an 11-year old back in 2002 seeing my favourite superhero come on screen for the first time. I liked the fact that they didn't rehash the origin story. This time Spider-Man is a small player in a much bigger Avengers laden world and he's figuring out what his purpose is. The villain in this film is actually interesting which is a rarity in Marvel. There is very little setup for future films and it actually is pretty self contained. And they actually goofed on the fact that him swinging around to transport himself is hardly possible outside Manhattan.Now onto gripes, which are there but it didn't take me out of the film like the Webb films did. Spider-Man's suit is way too tricked out with Tony Stark's gizmos, which makes him too much like Iron-Man and not really himself, which is a plot point but still. And it occurred to me: where's his Spider sense? Isn't that a key component to this character? Anyways just watch this. Have fun. It's a huge step up from the Amazing Spider-Man films but still doesn't stir the emotions of the first two Raimi films. I think I'm done here. It's good. Have a watch. Or don't. Up to you. I made a review. Hope you found it useful.",Null,14,23,8 July 2017
Fast & Furious 6," Watch it with half the brain you used to watch Fast Five with
","Oh wow, this is what you call jumping the shark. It all started in 2001 with a low budget film about the street racing subculture. Now its become an action film franchise with over the top machismo. Each film progressively chipped away more logic and physics.Now I actually liked Fast Five because it actually had a believable premise given the context. Yes it was cheesy and over testosteroned but it actually had a well paced plot. However the cast has ballooned to a very large size, this film's become very unfocused. So much so that every character is now laughably one dimensional. There are numerous contrived plot points and no character ever questions anything. The Rock's character is after a bad guy but since the bad guy uses cars, oh, I need Vin Diesel AND HIS TEAM for this. And yeah, everyone is willing no question.I thought that Fast Five actually concluded the characters story arcs but they wanted to due a fan service by resurrecting Michelle Rodriguez. And it was done in the most contrived fashion as possible by giving her amnesia.The film did have some pretty good set pieces but sadly you saw all these action sequences in the trailer. And thats because the film slows down in the second act and it tries to liven up by even putting in a street race in the middle of a surprisingly empty London. And that's weird seeing how each film's plot revolves around how many car stunts they can put in.And the action scenes really make the vault drag in Fast Five physically plausible. There is so much flying around and defying gravity, I'll bet you'll see less in the upcoming Superman film. And the physics of this film is so inconsistent. In the tank scene we see the villain engage in casual murder by pancaking all the cars in a highway yet it seems to have trouble crushing Tyrese's car. Also the plane scene in the climax; that must be the longest runway in the world.I can see why Justin Lin took this franchise to that many films, because the initial ones weren't that profitable. However at over 2 hours long, you start wondering how you could take any of the cheesy dialogue that fills this film seriously.Oh well, its pure popcorn pleasure. It knows what it does, even though you'll be palming your forehead at many instances.",6,1,3,4 June 2013
Malcolm X," It's about Malcolm X that's what made this Spike Lee movie actually good
","I know it's 18 years too late but I want to review this. I was watching a documentary on Muhammad Ali on TV two days ago so one thing led to another therefore I was watching this. Spike Lee is a very weird director. I've seen a couple of his films like Inside Man, He Got Game and Clockers. All these films were watchable but they were made with such weird techniques.So initially you get that Spike Lee smear when you watch the first hour of this film which chronicled Malcolm's teenage years in Boston and Harlem. However when you think about it was filmed that way just to indicate how buck wild the young Malcolm was.Once the movie enters the stage of Malcolm's incarceration and transformation that's when you see less of Spike's running gags and more substance from the man Denzel himself.Great film, I learned what I needed to know about the most complicated figure in the Civil Rights Movement.",9,2,5,2 September 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America and SHIELD is a more apt title
","Well for starters as a Marvel fan I was pretty happy. And as a Canadian watching a film about a walking American flag, I enjoyed it. 'MURICA! Any ways I usually give films a 10 star rating as long I don't get wholly taken out of the film and for the most part this film managed to keep me invested.I do like the fact that it is very tonally different from the other Marvel films we've seen so far. This is very much a spy thriller film with comic book stylization peppered in. It has a very engaging plot with a very cool twist in the middle which I won't spoil.The plot involves Cap now working for SHIELD, doing missions, 70 years after being in suspended animation. He no A major story arc in the comics is how Rogers is trying to adjust to modern society. While the film does touch on this, it gets sacrificed for screen time and it looks as if Cap is more or less content. Something I do like is how, this once unrelatable superhero from the 40s who did nothing else but punch Axis agents in the jaw, is now the voice of reason against blind patriotism, over surveillance, the climate of fear and the drone culture.The titular character, the Winter Soldier, is in all of his bad ass glory. While he doesn't get a poor send off like Bobba Fett or Darth Maul or get reduced to a punch line like (shudder) the Mandarin, he still kinda gets pushed aside for the larger plot elements. I do like the fact that they totally stuck to the comic book design of this character although the Soviet Star on his metal arm only confused me with his allegiance. You will see why.The other characters were just awesome. Robert Redford doing his spy movie thing, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is hot as always although these films really like scratching at her back story but never provide. Anthony Mackie's character as the Falcon I thought was a cool addition and not too contrived seeing that Black superheroes are generally lacking.The more technical stuff I enjoyed was actually the downplaying of CGI, the action set pieces and the fight choreography. I will have to say Marvel, they're on the up and up again after Iron Man 3.",10,1,2,6 April 2014
Interstellar," Not Nolan on his A Game
","Look this is still a good film and my rating system has no actual weight here. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant film maker but lately you start noticing that he is not without his shortcomings.His films are laden with the same tropes especially the massive plot holes. And that was the reason I wanted to see this film, to see what plot hole he had this time and yes they are a plenty.I will still give credit to where it's due. He really wanted to make a head scratcher and this time with the laws of general relativity which the film does closely follow. Basically the emotional device here is that Matthew Mahogany traveling at a fraction of the speed of light through space makes him age slower than his kids and basically its a race against time.However the Nolan-isms come full circle with not-so-subtle foreshadowing, overly pretentious unnatural dialogue, heavy-handed symbolism, a really ear-ringing Hans Zimmer score which make the Inception horns sound like and an unnecessarily long run time.I can see that this is a script he didn't really have time to think through but you can see he tried and its still pretty entertaining. However it's no 2001 A Space Odyssey. He should stick to thrillers. Sorry.",8,9,18,14 November 2014
Predator," One of the best Sci-Fi films of all time
","Since the new film is coming out this year I've decided to watch the original again. And I have realized how original this concept is. Simply put a group of soldiers in a Central American jungle carrying out a mission are stalked by an extra terrestrial game hunter. It switches from the clich√© alien visitation concept of 'Are we alone in the universe?' to 'What the hell could have done this? There is something out there.' I like it how the characters themselves are not innocent, but you must sympathize for the lesser of two evils. I love how it transitions from a brainless action flick to a very suspenseful sci-fi horror-fest. Yes the action is brainless as I said, just like Shwharzenegger's previous film Commando, where he's a soldier firing from the hip surprisingly hitting every target while his enemy are unloading and missing him. Arnie is not without his stupid one liners although I do really like two of them which are 'You're one UGLY motherf***er!' and 'What the hell are you!?'. Since the story, concept, effects and creature design are so original, makes it excellent even for a Schwarzenegger film.",9,1,1,9 May 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I must be one of the few
","Now I haven't read to book but I am a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy so epic franchises aren't foreign to me at all. I must be one of the few that just wasn't completely blown away by this franchise.These films are good but to me they aren't worthy of really good, like Godfather good or Dark Knight good. I would make it Titanic good.Well the effects are mind blowing given that this was less than a decade after Jurassic Park. Also the sweeping shots of the New Zealand landscape were incredible. There was a really rich blend of colours used to indicate the tone of each scene. All in all it does a great job in showing the epicness and that the stakes are incredibly high. The casting was very well done. A very ambitious and fruitful effort which took between 4 to 6 years to make.OK now that's out of the way. There are a lot of elements of this film that really took me out of it. I know its nitpicking but all this stuff happens way too often.First of all the choice of close up shots. I know that this film won an Oscar for cinematography, but for every sweeping shot of landscape, there's a weird close up shots. Why is there a wide angle lens shaky camera in front of Sam's face? What's with the chopping of frames in some shots? Why is the camera so invasive to so many actors' faces? Then there are just some moments that come off as silly. Like when Saruman was spinning Gandalf on his head, it looked like he was break dancing. Or when Elrond was chanting in Elvish, they used a wide angle lens right in front of his face with a fading background and its edited so weirdly. Then there's the crying. Oh man how many characters just keep shedding that one tear. All Arwen ever does is cry. And I laughed when Boromir spontaneously cried when Galadriel communicated with him. Galadriel by the way just came off as creepy.The biggest thing that annoyed me was Frodo. To me he just came off as, and I'm sorry for saying this, retarded. OK I know Frodo is meant to be this non-adventure seeking hobbit with very little warrior skills but HE KEEPS FALLING DOWN! I know he is under four feet tall but seriously that doesn't mean he has the coordination of a toddler! He is the main protagonist and his constant clumsiness really took me out of the film. Every other hobbit was likable but holy smokes.But still after all this, this really paved the way for larger films and is still quite epic. One redeemable part of this film is Ian McKellan's performance. Magneto saves the day.",8,0,1,6 January 2013
Man of Steel," You'll believe that a Superman film can be satisfactorily done
","Right now you need to ignore most critics if you're a fanboy. This isn't the Dark Knight by any stretch of the imagination but it still is a pretty cool adaptation of a huge cultural icon. Since it's explosion from the beginning of the millennium, superhero films are being taken more seriously and are even becoming more plot driven. Now unlike Batman, it's quite difficult to get a proper story for Superman due to him being what fans call 'over-powered', so it's hard to present a challenge. Superman's more of an image of the perfect being rather than a character for good storytelling.However this film actually managed to get a plot going, and just like all the recent superhero films it even ties the story arcs of the hero and the villain. That is why the film actually spends a good amount of its beginning in Krypton. And this has to be the coolest depiction of Krypton yet, as it actually looks like something out of the Lucas pages.Because it spent some time on Krypton, when baby Kal-El lands on Earth, it immediately cuts to him as an adult. It presents him discovering his powers and coming to terms with his origins in the form of flashbacks. This causes some pacing issues though and you sort of get lost in some scenes. And all of a sudden he comes out as Superman with no big reveal like the 1978 film. He isn't shown flying around Metropolis saving cats from trees, stopping bank robberies and just flat out messing with Darwinism. And this is what I actually enjoyed. It's a very different take on Superman, he isn't the boy scout Christopher Reeve portrayed, he is this flawed individual who has to step up when Earth faces a Kryptonian invasion. And Henry Cavill was a really good choice to portray this version of Superman, his undersized height notwithstanding.Yes time to get to the actors. Amy Adams as Lois Lane, not the best choice because Lois is supposed to be feisty and Adams doesn't give that kind of vibe. But her Lois was still well portrayed and thank god she's not an idiot. She actually figures out Superman's identity and you should've picked that up in some of the featurettes. Michael Shannon as Zod, while to me he was still the best choice to play him, it wasn't necessarily a part exclusive to him. Russel Crowe was good as Jor-El. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane were good as the protective Kents, and it was nice to see Costner again. Fishburne was good as Perry White. And Faora, wow, she sort of stole the show when it came to the bad guys. Every line she delivered oozed sensuality. So the cast was solid.While the film had some Nolan influences you could still tell Snyder was in full creative control. However because of Snyder's penchant for the visual the throw-down scenes between Kal-El and Zod got a little excessive almost delving into Michael Bay territory. While the actual tone of the movie wasn't actually emotional, like it was presented in the first 3 trailers, and instead more of a sci-fi action flick, my majority feelings were positive. I enjoyed the hell out of this and it easily washed away the bad taste Iron Man 3 left. It was really awesome to see a very headstrong Superman that actually threw punches and was not a complete dork. This is the proper launching pad for sequels and possibly now DC's movies can compete with Marvel. Justice League movie anyone?",8,0,3,14 June 2013
Wanted," Weird, yes, buts its supposed to be like that
","This movie is pretty much a mix of Fight Club, X-Men, The Matrix and Kill Bill. Like Fight Club there are sequences which use CGI that portray the frustrated mind of the protagonist and the story is narrated by the protagonist using very unique details. Like X-Men this movie is about a brotherhood of super humans. The curving of the bullet is pretty much a reflection of the Matrix. And like Kill Bill this movie is about hit men. This movie had it all. It was really funny, it was deep, it was gory and it basically defied the laws of physics. Only thing is that I wish Angelina was less skinnier. It seems like Tomb Raider is long gone. This movie had the best ending I had ever seen when Wesley looks directly at us and says 'What the f*ck have you done lately?'. The best R-rated movie of this year.",9,3,7,28 June 2008
Silver Linings Playbook," Fly, Eagles Fly!
","I am a Philadelphia Eagles fan. One of the few in Canada, because most NFL fans here are Patriots, Bills and Packers fans. Why am I talking about the Eagles? Well they are actually a large plot point of the film. I'll get to that in a bit.Bradley Cooper plays Pat Solitano, a man discharged from a mental institution as he is diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He is trying to patch things up with his family and his wife while focusing his aggression into something constructive. Cooper was excellent for the part and I think it has something to do with this film being centred in his hometown. When I think of Philadelphia, two actors come to mind: Will Smith and him. Too bad he didn't do the accent, would've loved the have heard 'dat Philly tawk yah mean?'. And he can dance, that's nice. I heard Mark Wahlberg was in talks for this role... yeah... dodged a bullet there.Jennifer Lawrence plays Tiffany, a fellow nutcase who helps Pat find focus by involving him in her dance project. She was very good in her performance. It just keeps bugging me that she's my age. She is already and accomplished actress while I still have no clue whether or not to apply for grad school. Damn.Robert De Niro, I love seeing him back. He plays Pat's dad, a very superstitious Eagles fan. See. He also bets on Eagles and Phillies games. This role is slightly different but still De Niro. Since he is from New York it was nice seeing him as a South Philly dad.And it was great seeing Chris Tucker again especially in such a downplayed role. As a comedian I never thought he was funny, he was always just shrieking in his whiny register, here I actually liked him. And also the Indian guy who plays Pat's therapist, man the onslaught of Indian actors in American films continues.I guess I liked this film a lot because it was directed by the director of Three Kings, which is actually one of my favourite films. Also this film wasn't over-dramatic it had the right balance of emotions.Going back to the Eagles. I could tell from the beginning line that this film took place in 2008 because they were referencing DeSean Jackson dropping the ball at the 1 yard line. That was a surprisingly good season, since they went to the NFC title game for the 5th time but they lost. I hate Larry Fitzgerald for that. Because of this film I really miss Donovan McNabb as quarterback and Andy Reid. Hopefully Michael Vick and Jason Peters can recover and give us the ring we badly deserve.Finally in all the bits involving the Birds, why couldn't they get Merrill Reese to do some voice overs?",10,1,7,11 January 2013
Face_Off," John Woo is the man
","Michael Bay should take notes on how to make an emotionally driven action film. Who knew that you could make a very well paced Hollywood heroic bloodshed film.John Woo films are an acquired taste. Somehow you can easily suspend your disbelief. The firefights in where everybody is diving, the slow motion, the marksmen who are bad shots, the dramatic Mexican standoffs, the use of doves, just the general over the top sequences are not mean't to portray realism but rather the intensity of the situation. And it works.This also has to be the best body swap film. Freaky Friday and a whole bunch of other works are just... played out. This is much more refreshing, seeing it being done through medical technology instead of some contrived magic spell. Not only that but its not meant to be quirky, that is not to say the movie is without some laughs.However there are some things that are sort of cheesy, the maniacal laughter, the whole peaches thing and the face caress. Those are minor however.John Woo is the man. There should be to an extent more Hong Kong directors in Hollywood with a lot of creative control. And I'm sorry Bollywood fans, your directors are inept to this task (I'm only saying this because I'm of Indian descent). It's only a matter of time we see another heroic bloodshed Hollywood film.",10,0,1,7 September 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," There will be mixed reviews
","I guess the best way going about this is by comparing this one to the 2002 film. After watching this film I can confirm that Raimi's semi campy version is marginally better. For the record I'm saying that Raimi's version wins by split decision, sort of.First of all, it's quite surprising that the 2002 film is more faithful to the source material than this one. Don't let the artificial web shooters in this film mislead you, it strays from it afterward.They had to redo the origin story in this one as well as add other elements to it which really start to make certain plot points incredibly forced. We didn't need to see another origin story, they could've done it like The Incredible Hulk where it's presented in fragments. Nope instead you end up with this poorly paced film with these subplots that never resolve, unnecessary sequences (skateboard) and a huge amount of suspension of disbelief (bending a field goal post and still no one suspects Parker is Spidey?!). Uncle Ben's death in this film was more contrived here, and it doesn't resonate as much as it did in the original.What's really good though is that Andrew Garfield is a way better Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire. He was portrayed excellently in this one. Showing that he is very crafty, inventive, productive and reclusive at times. And Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was so much better than Bring It On as Mary Jane. Gwen isn't just some damsel in distress, she is a very useful character. That is where the film gets huge plus points. They have really good chemistry and their romance is genuine and not tiresome.However the Raimi films (first two) dominate in the villain department. And I know what your thinking: the Green Goblin in that ridiculous suit?! That's better than the Lizard?! Yes. Ignore the get up and actually observe the dynamic between the villain and Spidey in each film. They have a sense of humanity, you really get to care for them when they die. This film really had a good opportunity with the Lizard by portraying him as someone struggling with a Jekyl/Hyde syndrome, just like the comics. Instead both personalities are just insane and with no shred of humanity. So much for staying faithful.Some reviewers say that this version is darker and 2002 is very light hearted to which I say: the 2002 version has a bigger body count first of all and Danny Elfman did the music.I'll end this user review on a positive note. Like I said I have mixed feelings for this one. So I have to name the rest of the stuff I liked. The effects were much better here. The Mirror's Edge like sequences rocked. And I really liked the scene where he's in the sewer and he makes a web to detect vibrations like a real spider does.Go watch it, you'll either love it or hate it. Luckily I'm sort of a tweener.",7,1,3,5 July 2012
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Messy but still enjoyable
","I really love the first two movies. I really do. They were made during a different climate. Audiences are very used to comic book films now and their grandiosity but back then the first two films were very much contained. Therefore they had more subtlety and sophistication.They were also directed by Bryan Singer, the genius behind one of the coolest films I've ever seen (KEYZER SOZE!) and it makes you wonder: where the hell was he in the last four films?!And you an definitely see that he is now cleaning up the last four turds that were dropped on the franchise he built. Yes I even include First Class which basically butchered any discernible continuity and messed up all character arcs.And the film messily incorporates all the elements of the preceding four and on top of that has to incorporate fan service, build the plot around CGI heavy set pieces and a gratuitous ass shot of Hugh Jackman's bare ass (shudder). Throughout the film I've had more questions than answers. The plot is all over the place that some characters are rendered useless, especially our favourite Wolverine, since he time travels to when he had bone claws.However when you get past all that and go straight to the Singer elements that's when you appreciate it. The acting is still really good and the imagery and themes capture the pathos of the comics really well. Also the opening credits just like the first two with the DNA helix roller coaster, just awesome to see that again.I can honestly say that this film series has seriously jumped the shark. But as a film with the basic metrics of acting, production value and emotion it is still very good. However for the love of god just give the rights of X-Men to Marvel studios, the same goes for Spider-Man.",9,1,4,24 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," What can you say? The MCU's batting average is pretty solid
","The Marvel films have come a long way now. First they started with movies establishing the characters. Then they all crossed over to fight threats. Now the only sensible thing to do is to start having them come into serious conflict with each other.The MCU films have so far been solid. You have had great ones like Iron Man, The Avengers and Winter Soldier. And you've had meh ones like Iron Man 2, Thor the Dark World. For me personally, the worst of the bunch is Iron Man 3 but even that is somewhat well made.I will say Civil War is the more appropriate Avengers sequel. Ultron somewhat gave me a headache as it was all over the place. And its no surprise Joss Whedon just quit after that. This film is surprisingly contained despite being based off of Mark Millar's very extensive storyline. Having removed Hulk and Thor really helped contain the story.The action set-pieces, while not as all over the place as Ultron was, were still sometimes difficult to watch. I like that the Russo brothers introduced some grit in the Winter Soldier, but they introduced a mild form a shaky cam in Civil War. Yes the camera jolted up and down at times during a frenetic action sequence with some quick cuts.The best set-piece though had to be the airport throwdown. And unlike Batman v Superman earlier this year, there was a proper build-up to the throwdown between the two disagreeing factions. Not only that, the airport was empty so you can watch the fight with maximum comfort and not worry about civilians or wanton destruction.And with the build-up to the fight, you can definitely see the characters really develop, not only in this film but the preceding ones as well. Tony Stark started off as basically a neo-con in the first film, then to a guy who opposes the government to now believing in accountability therefore being surprisingly in favour of the superhero registration accord. Steve Rogers a guy who is a relic from a different time is basically someone who always wants to do the right thing and working for the government that looks out for its own self interests may not be the right thing. Both have equally valid points.There are two new additions. Black Panther or T'Challa is the first. And I'm so glad he finally got his big screen treatment. He is such an awesome character and adds to the diversity sorely lacking in superhero films. His costume is amazing as well. With the director of Creed making his film, it will kick a lot of ass.The second addition is Spider-Man. And this is one of the better adaptations of the character as they really embellished on his youth. We keep forgetting that Spidey is in his teens. Although I am concerned now that the Marvel films have an over-abundance of quippy characters: Iron Man, Starlord, Ant-Man and now him.As usual in an MCU film, the villain is forgettable. In this case however, you can excuse that because the main conflict is between the heroes. The revelation in the third act really helps to reinforce that.So yes this film was really enjoyable. More focused than Ultron and better story telling than the DC films. The only gripe is just with the filming and editing of the action sequences. Marvel, you done it again.",9,14,28,6 May 2016
District 9," South African film well invested in...Worth Watching
","It's nice to see a science fiction film in which aliens are not blowing up New York or Washington or any part of the States. Johannesburg is a refreshing setting.These aliens are not hostile but they are refugees in need of asylum. So therefore the South African government allows them to settle in the slum of District 9. Eventually the slum becomes militarized and some of the aliens or 'prawns' become violent. So the weapons company of Multi-National United or MNU take responsibility for relocation of the aliens to another camp.If those who have watched it have not figured it out, this film directly mirrors the apartheid era, hence South Africa is the setting.For an international film the visual effects are really good. I am saying this because I do watch these new Bollywood films and the effects are pretty bad.The violence and gore in this movie makes Kill Bill look like a kids film.I liked it a lot.",10,2,6,19 August 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Underrated
","I saw this movie when I was a kid about 10 years back. I felt nostalgic, so I went to my cupboard, took out the VHS and placed in on my VCR. This movie is pretty much underrated. Since it didn't follow the novel that much and it had a bit of flat dialogue and characterization, it received 50 % positive reviews. I believe this film was better than the first in some ways. It had really good action sequences and its visual effects were ahead of its time. Even after the release of so many movies that have advanced in effects such as Transformers, Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, Spider-Man, King Kong (2005), Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. I still found the effects very believable. So believable that when I saw the scene with the Rex chasing the hunters and the other scene where the Rexes push the trailer off the cliff, I had a heart attack. This movie also one upped from its predecessor by placing the T-Rex in an actual city, and this was a year before Godzilla came out. In terms of characterization, I liked it that they made the genius mathematician Ian Malcolm the top character of the story. In the novel he was a key character who actually predicted that the park would fail, yet in the first movie it was more about Dr. Grant and the kids. The only thing that this movie may have failed in is just the dialogue which sounded a bit rehearsed, rushed, too quiet and used a bit too many big words and when I saw this movie I was 7 so I had a bit of trouble on trying to capture the plot. In the end this movie deserved better ratings and I will always be a fan of this epic franchise.",8,14,19,14 May 2008
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," If 'Planet of the Apes' wasn't in the title, it would just be called 'Semi-intelligent monkeys gone wild'
","Well let me start off on a good note. The acting was pretty good. The script didn't suck. So those things made the film watchable.But seriously I found it a bore. So the plot goes somewhat like this. A brilliant scientist (Franco) comes up with a retro-viral solution to Alzheimer's and administers them to (CGI) chimpanzee subjects. One chimp shows improvement but goes crazy one day and is shot down. Just before that she gave birth to a baby chimp, Caeser, which Franco is now taking care of. Along the way Franco meets that Indian chick, they both care for Caeser and at times Caeser scares the neighbours. YAWN. That alone takes up more than a quarter of the film. And it only moves on gradually. Caeser than scares the neighbourhood by biting off some guys finger and then he's sent to live in a zoo sort of place which is run by Malfoy and he treats them like crap, yawn. Then in the last 20 minutes they rush everything. Caeser breaks free and administers an airborne strain of the anti-Alzheimer virus and then the rest of the monkeys become intelligent and then they break out and trash a part of San Francisco and then they settle in the nearby redwood forest. THE END.That was it. And the only reason why people will watch this because it has 'Planet of the Apes' on the title. I mean seriously its called 'PLANET of the Apes' not 'Downtown San Francisco of the Apes'. Where was the sense of global urgency? None of that happens in the film. Only in a mid-credits scene is there a small sign of a global pandemic. I seriously think Charleton Heston is turning in his grave. But that's just me.",Null,3,7,23 August 2011
Django Unchained," Tarantino-gasm!
","Merry Christmas to all you Tarantino fans out there. I hope you made a Tarantino checklist so here we go.Witty dialogue, check. Excessive profanity especially use the word 'nigger', check. Excessive violence including testicles getting blown off, check. Soulful musical score, check. Sometimes non-linear narrative, check. Shots of women's feet, check. Very great character driven plot, check. An actual spaghetti western, even though it takes place in the American South, check.There are four standout characters played by the top billed actors.Jamie Foxx plays Django, a freed slave who becomes a bounty hunter. Even though he is the titular character, he gets downplayed when in the presence of the other actors. Still he delivers a solid performance, in fact hes very convincing. We all know Jamie Foxx as this golden voice RnB singer and comedian with a very clean cut image. He was able to pull off the whole transitioning from a timid slave to a menacing bounty hunter. Not only that he had the whole look down too, with all the facial scarring and the messy hair.Christoph Waltz plays Dr. King Schulz, a German dentist turned bounty hunter who frees Django so he could help pursue his previous owners who are targets. Waltz is a very charismatic actor, and thats how he does this role. Presents every line with finesse.Leonardo Dicaprio is in his best yet. He plays a plantation owner, Calvin Candie, and is the owner of Django's wife. This is a very different role. We've seen Leonardo in gritty roles before but never did he play this lecherous antagonist. We were all used to Leo being this teen idol, who looked like a member of Hanson. Here he's this Southerner with discoloured teeth and a scruffy beard.Finally Samuel L. Jackson who plays Steve, a house slave who you could say is the secret antagonist here. For all the screen time that he has he dominates. Sam usually plays boisterous roles as a tough guy, but it was very interesting seeing him play a devious and manipulative old man.The only gripe here was that this film was a little too long exceeding the three act structure, but its an epic western film so I'll excuse Tarantino for that. Yet again he made another great film with a lot of flair and carried well by the four big hitter actors. Well done Mr. Tarantino.",10,411,661,26 December 2012
2012," Headache
","I liked the special effects. But the movie itself was so long and it laughs at the face of geophysics. Rest assured many of you doomsdayers, nothing will happen on that year. Gravity is a weak force even though thats how planets interact. And a planetary alignment will not break apart the earth's crust. Rifts are actually quite harmless. But as usual it follows the formula. Mass destruction, bad acting and some random White American family survives. 2 and a half hours of this kind of gave me a migraine. I still like the effects though. Thought it was pretty cool. Honestly you could tell that 90 % of the shots were CG so the actors had no clue of what they were actually running away from, hence the bad acting. To get the true sense of the film, if the kids actually saw the city cave in, they would be leaking their pants. Now that would be an Oscar performance.",5,0,2,15 November 2009
The Bourne Legacy," If this wasn't in the Bourne universe, then it would be alright
","The previous Bourne films deviate from Ludlum's novels drastically, now there's a film without the franchise character.Now I think Jeremy Renner is an excellent replacement for Matt Damon (picture the Team America puppet if you will). He's come a long way since SWAT and he's become this token action star. But even he couldn't bring virility to this poorly developed character.Jason Bourne has become one of cinema's bad asses. He's incredibly skilled, resourceful, crafty and one hell of a hand to hand combatant. But what's really cool about him is how elusive he is and how he taunts the people on his tail.You don't get that vibe at all with Aaron Cross. And I don't blame Renner at all, I blame the poor scriptwriting. Where in any of the three films did we see Bourne having a dependence on pills? Or unaware that he's been surrounded by local police without someone yelling it at him? And in the film he doesn't even interact with his handler, Ed Norton, apart from a flashback scene.I knew they wanted not to make a carbon copy of Jason Bourne but Aaron Cross is a Treadstone assassin, you think you would be seeing some strong similarities. What ends up happening the whole time is that you see a cheap knock off of Bourne.And the main problem is that it had to force in these scenes reminding us it takes place in the Bourne universe. It shows how Treadstone is being uncovered when the plot surrounding Aaron Cross is completely different. Had this Jason Bourne plot line been erased you still would have had a generic albeit good film about an assassin trying to escape certain death because his government program failed. That would've been good.This movie is enjoyable but not memorable and it should keep Jeremy Renner's career fruitful. It ultimately suffers from the and gives into the pressure of its franchise.",7,5,8,29 August 2012
X-Men: Apocalypse," So the era of big budget messy comic book films continues
","This is not Bryan Singer's fault. I love the usual suspects and the first two X-Men films. I can definitely see a leaky script and studio meddling here.I don't get it? Why does every comic book film since the advent of the Avengers have to be these poorly paced bloated CGI messes? And are we really following the messy continuity and character arcs of First Class ?Re-watching Singer's first 2 films I realised how brilliant they are and how much I dislike everything since. Those first two films basically showed us how less is more. I found it strange how back in 2000, when comic-book films were still finding their footing, Fox decided to adapt one of Marvel's longest running and convoluted properties of a team of superheros where the roster constantly changes. Especially with a relatively low budget considering what they cost now. But it worked, since Singer stuck to limiting the characters, grounding the story and stylistic elements and focusing on the main themes of persecution and prejudice. And they hold up really well.It was unfortunate how the first two films focused a little too much on Wolverine. But hey, the character is the most popular and he serves a purpose so it really never bothered anyone. However for this new reboot/prequel series, I DO NOT CARE ABOUT MYSTIQUE! PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP TRYING TO MAKE HER HAPPEN! STOP TRYING TO MAKE HER A PIVOTAL CHARACTER! I don't care that the studio got Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence to play her. She is a shapeshifter, what good is that going to do when you are fighting a demigod who can bend reality?Oh yeah the villain, Apocalypse. He is your generic villain that wants to end the world while ensnaring other mutants to do his bidding while he speaks in a Buffalo Bill monotone. What you expected a villain on par with Ian McKellan's Magneto or Brian Cox's Stryker who were actually layered and multi-dimensional? And yeah Fassbender's Magneto is so all over the place? What are his ideologies? What are his convictions? Why is he still on good terms in Prof X even though he paralysed him and dropped a baseball stadium over the white-house only furthering the fear of mutants? Usually I moan about character development especially with a film that features an ensemble cast, but actually some were done right. Jean Grey and Cyclops were actually pretty interesting. We see them young and trying to develop their powers, although still they have yet to explain why Cyclops can't control his beams while his eyes are opened (hitting his head in a plane crash). And Jean Grey is mostly a telekinetic so why did they focus on her telepathy so much? The Quicksilver scenes were awesome as usual with his slowed down perception. One character who I felt somewhat got the Shaft was storm, as early in the film she became Apocalypse's underling. She is one of my favourite X-Men and is very powerful but we don't see her use them in a useful way.The pacing. There is one sub-plot which came out of nowhere and was used for fan service. And the many of the Mystique scenes.Ultimately this suffers from Age of Ultron syndrome. This is not a bad movie. Nowhere near the mess of Batman vs Superman. However it does not have the balance of Captain America Civil War. It is still another CGI orgy. In the end I really like the first two Singer films. They were so in tune with the themes of the comic book and didn't really care about the look so this film is not my cup of tea. If you like the flashy stuff and not really care about character dynamics then you should be fine with it.",Null,1,6,27 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," It's the Amazing Hipster Spider-Man
","I'm sorry, I really want to love this film and in general the film series but for the most part I was mildly thrilled. I still have a soft spot for Raimi's film's even though I know Garfield and Stone are way better to watch than Maguire and....ugggggh...Kirsten Dunst and the 3rd film was awful. However I will give credit to where credit is due, this film does do some stuff better. Like they show the Rhino, pre-armour, as this crazy Russian gangster. The swinging and action sequences look cool as hell. Spider-Man makes his wise cracks, which were rarely in the Raimi films. Also Peter Parker takes the initiative and researches ways to defeat his foe. And Spidey's got the original costume.Yes I said foe, singular. The plot is too dense for it's own good and it ends up devoting screen time to the wrong things. The villains are one of them. It eventually ends up being that Electro is the main villain, and man is his story arc weak and silly to begin with. Seriously, who keeps a vat of electric eels lying around, and conveniently place them under a live wire and- OK calm down. And they call Raimi's films silly. There are way too many plot threads, and some really didn't require a resolution. Especially that thing with Peter's dad. Any idiot from a mile away could've easily figured out that his dad was fleeing because this company wanted to misuse his inventions and blah blah blah screen time wasted.Another thing that wastes screen time is the on again off again relationship between Peter and Gwen. Sure the two actors have chemistry but this stuff relative to the plot was tooth rotting. And also it really pushes the hipster aesthetic on you. And for those who've read the comics, you can tell that this movie has way less than subtle foreshadowing. And this is where my argument, on why the previous decade's Spidey films (at least the first two) are actually better, comes full circle. The Raimi film's have more of a timeless quality to them. They have that post 9/11 vibe and the stories flow really well albeit being very simple. When I watch the Amazing Spidey films, I can easily tell how dated they are. From the bad haircuts and clothes to the dubstep-ish music. Thank you director of 500 days of summer.In the end this movie is enjoyable. I can nitpick it to death but we all know Marvel needs to consolidate all their characters, now.",6,4,11,11 May 2014
Jurassic World," It's actually not as silly as I thought
","OK it still was but there are some very interesting moments. This film is a mix of things, part Spielberg movie, part monster movie and part brainless summer popcorn flick.Let's start off as I usually do with the plot. Let's be honest, the first film had a lot subplots that went nowhere like the sick triceratops, the lysine contingency, the dinosaurs breeding and especially the stolen embryos. Sorry Spielberg fans.Here there is simple albeit a very cohesive plot. The park is now operational for many years but attendance is dwindling so they engineer a hybrid. The hybrid gets loose and chaos ensues. It does get silly however, especially in the third act with the velociraptors.So yeah, lets talk about the dinosaurs. From a technical standpoint, the CGI it....sucks. The first two films had such gorgeous digital dinosaurs because the animators used a lot of computing power to produce altogether 4 minutes of shots. They got the lighting and the physics right and they were only used in wide shots. In this film they are ugly, pasty, floaty and cartoonish looking things. Also they seem to behave more like movie monsters than animals. The velociraptors are supposed to be intelligent, I get that, but its supposed to be in the sense of opening doors and cornering their prey and not in the sense of communicating with Chris Pratt and what happens in the third act.Then the human characters. They are all very one dimensional. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard's character, no one else seems to have a story arc, again something the first film did really well. Chris Pratt is basically Muldoon but he just espouses Legolas like commentary like 'she's killing for sport' which is very insulting to the audience's intelligence. Bryce Dallas Howard is this uptight corporate person who wears high heels throughout the entire movie, even during chases scenes. Vincent D'Onofrio is this military industrial complex guy who wants to weaponize dinosaurs- yeah you read that right. BD Wong who had one scene in the first film returned for a much more expanded role here.Then we have the two kid actors who are supposed to be Lex and Tim. And oh god I hated them. This was one of the more futile attempts to make the film more Spielberg-ish and no, let Steve handle child actors from now on. Among all this silliness though there are unusual flashes of brilliance. What am I talking about? I actually saw some of the themes, motifs and imagery of Michael Crichton's original novel. The original novel went at great lengths to describe unstable systems and chaos theory which sadly the original film just glossed through. In the novel the park was said to be an unstable complex system doomed to fail by Ian Malcolm, then Nedry shuts off the power. In the film it shows Nedry being more or less responsible. In this film its actually more subtle when we hear the guy from Let's Be Cops hint at it and we see the Indominus Rex destabilize the park.Also the death scenes are very akin to Crichton's book. For a PG-13 film there is a lot of blood spatter. However there was this one death that was in very poor taste and I felt should've weighed in on the characters a bit more but no. And that's what I meant when I said this more or less is a brainless film.I still think the movie is pretty silly overall but whenever it goes away from being a Spielberg wannabe and a Michael Bay film, it actually has its moments. It will never be as good as the first film, hell even the second which I actually liked but it more than surpasses JP3 as it does manage to capture the theme of Man vs Nature again pretty well.",7,9,31,16 June 2015
Logan," The last film with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine just happens to be a borefest
","Look I'm not trying to be non-conformist here. It seem's like I've been crapping on every X-Men film since the 3rd one. However there are actual good things to say about this film. The acting and the script are really good, and the tone is actually pretty consistent here. Its also very nice to finally see a Wolverine film where there there is a good amount of blood.But for every scene where Wolverine hacks away at the bad guys does it have to be filled in with 40 mins of snail paced scenes? There are so many scenes of just... talking and... driving and...drinking and... pill popping and... sleeping and driving and talking DEAR LORD! I know this is supposed to be a gritty, almost western like film based off the Old Man Logan comic where its more about the character arc than saving the world but... no that's still no excuse. The studio threw a budget into this and this is Hugh Jackman's last outing as the character, it could've done better.The plot could've been better. It could've been about Wolverine renouncing the use of his claws (just like Old Man Logan) but something from his past comes back to haunt him and he must fix this before his time runs out and in the process hacks away at some armour-clad gunmen. Instead we get a weird Last of Us ripoff mixed in with a road trip movie where Wolverine, the badass mind you, is a baby-sitter and nurse. And the villains suck by the way. The first one is played by the guy from Narcos, and I don't remember the character's name at all that's how forgettable he was. He didn't really do anything menacing. The second is the first one's boss. A scientist who just happens to make stuff happen with little to no explanation. There is a huge bit of exposition regarding the second villain and in essence the film's premise but it was all condensed into one throw-away line. Let me compare this to another R-rated superhero film with a brooding protagonist which also kick-started the Marvel boom: Blade. I remember there were actually a lot of quiet slow paced scenes. But why do I like that film way more? Well actually even the slow paced scenes served a purpose, they weren't filler. The protagonist was consistently badass and stoic and had a mission from the beginning and wasn't thrust into a situation. The villain was a lot of fun. The movie had a lot of atmosphere and world building. And most of all, every character tried to be pro-active.I'm sorry you had to read this but this is film. It's subjective. I understand there are some emotions attached to this as Hugh Jackman will say goodbye to this character and I think X-Men will start fresh. But take off those goggles and watch it as just a film and you will see just how boring it is. Hey at least that opener with Deadpool was fun.",Null,3,8,9 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," (Sigh)
","I think the Marvel studio heads should realise now that comic books and film are two very different media. I don't feel like I'm watching a film franchise any more but a television series on steroids. And everything has to tie into the next couple of episodes.And hence you get to see this bloated mess with so many sub-plots and really uneven pacing. Initially it starts off strong, cool action sequence in a snowy mountain and everything. Then Tony Stark and Bruce Banner create an artificial intelligence via Mcguffin and it becomes sentient and then genocidal. Which at this point in the MCU Tony has become such an unlikeable character. I don't understand why Hank Pym wasn't introduced earlier on in the franchise. It wouldn't balanced out Tony's character a lot more, but now he's reckless and just straight up stubborn.Once Ultron gets loose this is where you get to see why the first film was so much better. Much of the second act in the first film had all the characters, even the antagonist Loki, in the heli- carrier, and you get to see them all interact, develop character and advance the plot. Here the second act was literally all over the place as they hopped from one set-piece to another. First you have the Iron-Man Hulkbuster throwdown in Wakanda where they level a 30 story building where it brought up uncomfortable 9/11 imagery. Then the movie just stops where all the characters reconvene in a log cabin where Hawkeye can finally get some character development so the audience can be told 'Hey! He's not that useless. We hired Oscar Nominee Jeremy Renner for a reason'. Then you have a forced romance between Banner and Romanoff which came out of left field. I'm sorry what was all that between her and Captain America in the Winter Soldier for? And what happened to Betty Ross? Then you have Thor and his water well, I dunno. The second act was disorienting to say the least.Ultron is not a good a villain as Loki. He's an artificial intelligence who has access to nuclear launch codes, and the characters point that out but he doesn't go through with it and instead opts for a more convoluted scheme. Also at times he gets very comical. The final confrontation between the Avengers and Ultron was also messy. The previous film also had an intense chaotic final act but it was still easy to follow. This one got really difficult to follow with characters disappearing for minutes at a time and attending to stuff which really seemed minor to me at times.As a Marvel film its nowhere near as good as the first Iron Man, the fist Avengers film or the Winter Soldier. However as a popcorn flick its still there. Hmmmmmmmmmm.",7,3,8,8 May 2015
Men in Black," If only mainstream sci-fi films could learn
","I could have reviewed this film after Men In Black 3 came out, but whatever.I was seven when I first saw this. I remembered the heavy promotion and the music video of Will Smith's resurgence into hip hop. I remembered two things: This film is kinda weird and I want a pair of Ray Bans.Weird in a good way. It's not a conventional sci-fi film. I would go on to say that it's a dark comedy. Everything about sci-fi films is portrayed in such a different tone. It has an unusual blend of wonder, eeriness, and comedy, which you could tell right off the bat with the opening music.I found the idea refreshing. We've all heard of the mythical men in black, supposedly shadowy figures that silence UFO witnesses. Here they portrayed much more light heartedly, as people doing a job. The exposition in this film is actually subtle. The humour derives itself on the fact that most characters are so deadpan and that they're very used to dealing with extra terrestrials. Instead of a film where we're trying to understand how to defeat the antagonist, we're looking at a film where it's just all in a day's work.Another source of great humour is the dynamic between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. The grizzled emotionless veteran and the young idealistic new recruit. Agent J shows us the human perspective while throwing in that genuine Fresh Prince comedy.What baffled me is how lowered the scope is of this film. The climax involved the destruction of the earth by an alien battleship and they bleakly made it clear that it doesn't matter.'There's always an alien battle cruiser, a Korillean death ray or an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this miserable little planet and the only way these people get on with their happy lives is that they do not know about it!'. Basically put, we don't matter, we are insignificant in the bigger picture.I remember that parts of this film freaked me out, especially scenes with the Edgar bug. But that has to be the best silver screen villain ever.I loved it and it will be one of my favourite sci-fi films ever.",10,3,4,15 September 2012
Avatar," Whoa....
","Its basically the visuals. I could see why this film took 12 years to make. The plot is relatively simple. Its like the good conquistador and the natives just before the rest of the Spanish arrive and rape, pillage, plunder, except the natives are blue not brown and the Spanish are Earthlings. The visual effects are crazy son! Its an entirely lifelike world created in a desktop. There's a detailed explanation to every fictitious wildlife. However watching this you realize that the imagination is only limited to whatever we see. Everything in the film comes from something we have seen before. Native tribes, tigers, rhinos, lemurs, horses, wolves and giant birds. 12 years of work went into it so the hype didn't fail. One thing. This movie is called Avatar, a word from Hindu mythology, did it have anything to do with it? Possibly, because there were BLUE PEOPLE in the movie!",8,10,17,21 December 2009
Super 8," What was up with the hype?
","I still clicked on the spoiler warning checkbox but I don't know how necessary that would be considering you could figure it out yourself. You know that its an extra terrestrial on that train. You know that its 'plan' is basically it wants to return home and it needs parts to build a ship. The alien looked very similar to the Cloverfield monster, how original. You know the military gets involved to cover up their tracks. You know that it takes place in some quiet midwestern town in the 70s. Seriously this movie was hyped for no reason. They could have taken the marketing slowly like Transformers did. First trailer they show a vague figure. Then they show the actual robots but you don't hear their voices and so on. Yawn.",6,2,5,13 June 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," It's a sequel...
","There were some scenes that sort of made me uncomfortable.The action was of excess to the point it could give you a headache.And it looked like a military recruitment film.It's a sequel. It's supposed to be bigger and badder but it sort of misses the mark. I liked it that there were more robots, there was more of robot against robot fighting, that there is more robot-human interaction, and that it draws a bit from the old cartoon.Just watch it, have your popcorn and if the action becomes too much, close your eyes for a minute.",8,11,19,3 August 2009
Zero Dark Thirty," Insanely well done
","Who knew that the director of Point Break would make one of the best films I have seen so far. You thought the Hurt Locker was good.Now the Hurt Locker when I saw it, I couldn't find a story out of it. This movie is based on true events, so there is an excess of story. The actual manhunt for UBL goes back to the Clinton administration in the late 90s. The story here actually starts in 2003, and the screenplay does a good job in actually keeping the progression of the plot pretty linear. You can actually keep up with it and it trims a lot of the excess information. The movie focused solely on one narrative from the point of view of a single CIA agent who is obsessed with finding a certain courier.Now the actress who plays the CIA agent is very solid, I really enjoyed her screen presence. She really convinces you that she is thorough, dedicated and methodical and at the same time you still notice that she is hot. And the supporting cast were pretty good too.You will also notice that some of the lines are kind of cheesy or the delivery of them were cheesy. For example 'he is one of the disappeared ones','I'm the mother****er who found the compound', 'what convinced you? (guy waves his hands around) her confidence' or 'I'm not your friend. I'm here to break you'. Seriously we didn't need lines for the trailer.The authenticity is what really struck me. I am kind of suspicious as to how production manage to reproduce the surveillance footage of the compound. Hmm. Also the torture scenes, wow, they really make you uncomfortable. Is the film pro or anti-torture? Or is it that they just want to present you with the hard truth? Still the director decided to take some artistic liberties, such as the depiction of the Marriott bombing, which you will see what I'm talking about or actually notifying the SEALs who their target is days before takeoff to name a few.Speaking of which the last half hour is intense. We all know what happens so this isn't really a spoiler. The realism of the event was phenomenal, showing every maneuver and breach etc. So if your expecting some sort of Rambo like shoot out... umm no.What I actually really liked about this film was that it really didn't on the religious aspect that much, in fact barely at all. Generally films about Islamic terrorism like Executive Decision, The Siege, Body of Lies and The Kingdom always have this message of religious tolerance. This movie, like me, doesn't care about that at all. It just outlines who the bad guys are and how they operate. It doesn't explore the topic of their ideological motivations that much, but in one or two scenes they do talk about their financial motivations.All in all this is a really well done, gritty production and I don't think personally it glorifies or antagonizes anyone. It just shows what happened. OK there maybe a small chance where some guy in the theater may go 'USA! USA!'.",10,11,30,4 January 2013
American Gangster," My favourite genre lives on
","I like crime epics. I love crime epics. Something about them I cannot resist watching. Maybe because they are 2 and a half hours of getting money, power and respect.My favourite films are The Godfather, Scarface, Heat, Pulp Fiction, The Departed, Goodfellas...These films though the same genre, they vary in some way. They are about Italian American organized crime, Latin American drug cartels, Irish American organized crime, heists, hit men and so on...American Gangster follows the format, this time it chronicles an African American, Harlem based crime lord's rise to power and a New York City cop's quest to bring him down and also corruption in the NYPD.I liked it. It's one of those films you can call your favourite. You can walk out of the theatre enjoying and still thinking about it.",10,2,3,3 August 2009
Kong: Skull Island," Such a weird film experience that really ended up being fun
","I wanted to see a movie on discount Tuesday and thought to myself why not watch another studio churned cgi mess? This is exactly what it was but somehow managed to be subversive enough in its presentation that I had a lot of fun watching it.This is supposed to take place in the same universe as the Godzilla film of 2014. That is why King Kong is the size of a 30 story building, in hopes that he can throw down with Godzilla in a crossover film. Unlike Godzilla however, this film didn't shy away with showing as much Kong as possible and it was glorious. The scenes where Kong smashes helicopters and fights monsters had that perfect blend of over-the- top action and just being visceral. And the violence in this film had a degree of macabre, so there were moments I was like gasping and chuckling saying 'Oh my god!'. So many characters get picked off at unexpected moments that it kept the film really suspenseful.Now this film follows a trend where this is the sophomore film of a director who's debut was a low budget indie film. I think studios do this so that the director is easy to push around and you can cheap out on his share of the budget. And I think the director knew this so he decided to mess around with the audience. There is so much weird dialogue about nothing and I swear the median shot length of the first act was around 1 second because it kept quick cutting. And rather than being annoyed with it, I embraced it and only make me like it more as I placed myself in the directors shoes.The plot was also weird to say the least especially the setting. Why they wanted the film to be set during the Vietnam War confuses me still. Is it because they wanted to represent a demoralized military force being defeated again by a primitive enemy? Or to push Samuel L Jackson's character as really jaded as he is a Colonel in the US Army. Either way it really worked, because what we ended up getting was a mix of Apocalypse Now, an adventure film, a monster film, a b- movie and Moby Dick.The characters in this film were a mixed bag. Loki and much of the cast were uninteresting and one dimensional. I don't recall Loki ever going through a character arc and all the blonde girl was characterized as an anti-war shutterbug. The two most interesting characters were played by John C Reilly and Samuel L Jackson. Reilly plays a WW2 pilot who crash landed on the island and had survived off the natives. He was so eccentric and funny and I loved him. Samuel L Jackson though stole the show. As mentioned he plays a very Jaded US Army Colonel who basically becomes the Captain Ahab of the film. I love it when he plays these intense unhinged characters and was so glad he could fit this into his filming schedule. Please keep making movies Sam, I beg you!So yea, I highly recommend this. Its a very entertaining film that doesn't take itself too seriously unlike Godzilla 2014 did. It has a lot of the generic big budget action tropes but it also manages to mess with your expectations.",10,4,8,14 March 2017
Inception," Nolan. Period.
","Now I'll admit that this doesn't make you think as much as the Matrix did but it's still very brilliant. If you think like Nolan you will be able to understand as to how he constructed the rules of this film. When the main characters go through so much of the rules of a dream with you it naturally fits in with how a person scientifically interprets it. Rather than just nodding your head and accepting like whatever you hear in Pirates of the Caribbean, the elements of this film just flow. Hence I didn't have a hard time understanding the plot.Unlike the Matrix or Fight Club this film is not an existentialist but rather an analysis of the human subconscious. Therefore you will not have any sleepless nights after watching this film. There are barely any religious implications thats what I love, instead very scientific.Now lets get to Nolan. I love his films because they are both plot and character oriented. You have excellent development in both areas. That's why they aren't hard to love.This film itself will plant the idea in your head to like it. I guarantee.",10,1,5,9 August 2010
X-Men: First Class," Continuity and Magneto
","Well I still think its a good film because the script wasn't corny, the acting was terrific, and the story itself is actually solid. However being a fan of the comics and the previous films, I can't help but shake myself of the fractures in continuity.OK fine, I very well know it's a very loose prequel, granted that. I don't care how for the most part it doesn't fit into the X-Men films of the 2000's, that's not it. I care because it really hindered Magneto's character development.Magneto is one of the greatest villains of all time and you can even check that on IGN.com. The reason why is because of his convictions and how he was strongly imbued with them. Having survived the Holocaust, Magneto becomes convinced that his fellow mutants could suffer the same fate as the Jews, hence he becomes the terrorist that he is.In this film however he meets the film's villain, Sebastian Shaw, in the death camp. Shaw wanted Magneto do display his power by moving a coin, and to provoke him he shoots his mother right in front of him and yes he triggers Magneto's powers in the process.So basically, Magneto's initial intentions are revenge against a single person rather than humanity. So you can see how the scope is lowered. Only until the end we see Shaw tell him that when the Cold War ends, humans will turn to mutants and hunt them down. That's when Magneto becomes Magneto. I think that's too cheap. It seriously spoiled the modus operandi of one of the greatest comic book characters.However it's still a good film. Better than Thor. I don't think it's better than the original X-Men films however, X2 was brilliant. I like how Professor X became a paraplegic in this film than in the comics. In the comics his legs were crushed by a boulder where in this film a bullet hits his spine.It's still worth a $10 ticket.",8,1,4,6 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," That's how you conclude a trilogy
","Superhero trilogies have a way of ending in a sour note. This is the first one to end on a high note.Straight to it. The plot: Takes place 8 years after the events of The Dark Knight, Batman has disappeared, Gotham is enjoying peacetime, Comissioner Gordon is racked with guilt having to conceal Dent's murders,and Bruce Wayne is a recluse whose physical and mental condition has deteriorated. Bane emerges as a new villain who plans to destroy Gotham (which oddly enough looks exactly like New York City now, instead of Chicago like the last two films). Like Batman Begins the events leading up to the grand destruction are subtly put in place to show us the calm before the storm. And as you can tell from the trailer Bane severely injures Batman and drops him into this underground jail.Unlike TDK, TDKR has a much more cohesive plot with much less plot holes even though they still exist its not as extensive as TDK (5 dead two of them cops, where?!). It also has a proper three act structure with a climax towards the end of the film and not the middle like TDK. I also felt that this film had much less cheesy dialogue than TDK.The cast is again on point here. Christian Bale again does a pretty good job in showing a Bruce Wayne gone through hell, and this time he eased up a little on the Batman voice. Michael Caine as Alfred who is still the comic relief but unfortunately he's absent through most of this film (part of the plot). Gary Oldman as Comissioner Gordon, who's not so stressed out in this film like he was in the last oddly enough. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays John Blake an idealistic cop who actually is useful. Morgan Freeman, still love him. And Marion Cotillard plays a new board member Miranda.Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was incredible. She was actually really hot, her costume looked dynamic like an actual high tech jewel thief and not some sort of weird S & M outfit (safe to say she doesn't have a whip), and she was portrayed as a femme fatale which was so much cooler. When initially learning that Tom Hardy was going to play Bane and not some taller guy, it was the same reaction as to when we learned Heath Ledger was playing the Joker, and yet again I was proved wrong. Tom Hardy was menacing as Bane. He looked physically imposing and his voice is much clearer but still a little muffled.This has to be the best superhero trilogy ever made. Since DC Comics keep re-imagining their characters they are open to many artistic interpretations and Chris Nolan did it the best with Batman. He took this comic book character that for many years was placed in this very cartoonish universe and was put in a very realistic place making a very visceral piece of art. Each film had a very different look to it and thats what makes it a really good trilogy.I have very little gripes with this film, actually just one but that pertains to the ending. But its just a minute detail.On a side note I hope the state of Colorado can pick themselves up again after another tragedy. I hope the United States realizes how important regulating guns is and not chastising the media (this is just a friendly message from a Canadian friend don't take it the wrong way).A very satisfying conclusion to an excellent trilogy.",10,9,20,20 July 2012
Iron Man," Ballin!!!
","After the really crappy Spider-Man 3, Marvel movies have gone back on the map with this film. This time it has the word ballin!! written all over it. Robert Downey Jr plays billionaire industrialist Tony Stark who is a baller. This man drives an Audi R8 which is one of the sickest whips ever!!! Then there are just really off the chain action scenes. I found it really tight when he was evading the F22s. You would have never seen anything like that in a Superman movie which goes to show you that this movie has some sense of realisticness (dunno if thats even a word but whatever). And this guy saves a village from insurgents, however since this is a PG-13 movie that scene was toned down a bit, but still u don't see any other superhero do that. And also what i really like about this movie is that it's really chilled out and that its not as depressing as other comic book films but it does get serious when it should. This is 2008's movie of the year. When the sequel comes out I hope that there will be a War Machine and Mandarin.",10,1,3,16 June 2008
Toy Story 3," Takes Me Back
","I saw the first Toy Story film when I was six. Second when I was 9. It was worth waiting over 10 years for the third installment. When I went to the theatre to watch it today, I only saw one family and everyone else were my age, in their 20s. Nothing was messed around with. Actually maybe one thing... I will discuss that shortly. The original voice cast was brought back, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Wallace Shawn and Don Rickles. The story structures were kept intact, toys escaping from concrete areas. Since Pixar's technology has really developed, so have the environments and you will experience them in 3D pretty well. It has a lot laughs, some tears. Only one thing that may have been messed with was that Buzz Lightyear got reprogrammed in Spanish. This movie should take you back.",10,3,7,18 June 2010
The Matrix," Existentialism is the shiznit.
","I saw this movie when I was 10 years old and at first I did not understand it but I watched it again and again. The more I watched, the more I understood. The more I understood, the more difficult it became for me to sleep at night.However its the sequels that ruined the thought provocation and therefore it turned into a trilogy with an ending of good triumphing over evil rather than the enigma that the first installment left.This is about the first and I must say it is captivating. The visuals, the sound, the plot, the theme, motifs, the action and so on.In my English class, we had an assignment. We had to write about something that shaped our perception of the world. And one of my classmates wrote that watching this film did it for him.Entertaining and overwhelming.",10,0,1,16 August 2009
Godzilla," Eahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhr! (Supposed to be the Godzilla roar)
","This was one film I really wanted to see this year thanks to be shrouded in such secrecy. It could really enhance the film experience or ruin it. In a way, while I still enjoyed this film, it did kind of both.I will try not to spoil this film but what the trailers hinted at is that this movie takes place in a world where monsters exist. And given that zombies have taken over pop culture, Pacific Rim really needs some backup.The plot basically starts out with Heisenberg trying to figure out the truth behind an incident which he witnessed and that leads to the revelation that monsters exist. However Malcolm's dad isn't the central protagonist of this film, he actually gets cut short of screen time. Thats what happens when you get the 'and' label in the opening credits. However the amount of screen time he had, it was either go hard or go home, and he put his Breaking Bad chops into play.Actually the central protagonist is Kick Ass, and really? He's too damn young or at least too young looking to play a high ranking military guy and family man. Just because he's married to a lady twice his age doesn't mean he can play mature roles. And he's basically has a Brad Pitt World War Z story arc, trying to reconnect with his wife, a good looking Olsen sister I didn't know exist. There is Saito, who plays the scientist researching the monsters and has some pretty questionable philosophical views. And there are way too man expendable characters.I've been talking about the actors too much and that's because the movie focuses on the humans. Which is good story telling because it's easier to be invested in the story, just like the Walking Dead. But let's be honest, aren't we here to see monsters scrap? Well we kind of do but there's way too much buildup. Whenever we do see monsters finally come on screen the first couple of times it immediately cuts to the aftermath. You get serious blue balls. Eventually it does pay off, not the way you hope but it has some insanely cool moments.The imagery of this film, wow. Remember that 1998 Roland Emmerich film? Yea that's a Disney film, with all the markings of a pre-9/11 light hearted romp. This film has such beautiful but shockingly dark and brooding imagery. When the carnage and destruction takes place, it's a little disturbing but jaw dropping at the same time. It basically recaptures the sense of atmosphere by the original 1954 Ishiro Honda picture.This movie also has a not-so-subtle anti-nuclear power and weapons theme. Come on, Hollywood why do you keep demonizing something that you clearly don't fully understand? Nuclear energy is clean and renewable, and if disposed of properly the waste decays in time without doing much harm. And nuclear weapons while scary, will always be used as deterrents and not as actual weapons.In the end this film is a very solid effort. You will find yourself, like me, nitpicking the crap out of it, but still enjoying it. It is not disappointing at all like the 1998 movie and it manages to capture its tone really well.",9,4,10,17 May 2014
Deadpool," A way better love story than Twilight
","2016 is going to be an insane year for superhero movies, yet the only one I was really interested in is this one. Seriously I am so disinterested now with the big budget superhero films with such convoluted plots, excessive and gratuitous use of CGI, awful pacing, and even being unfaithful to the comics.Speaking of unfaithful, I was so looking forward to seeing Wade Wilson in the 2009 Wolverine movie, even more when I heard Ryan Reynolds was playing him. That's perfect! Van Wilder can quip like no tomorrow so he's perfect for playing the Merc with the Mouth... sewn shut. Yea great job there Fox. And great job with Fant4stic too...Then the leaked test footage came out and all of us were like DO THAT! And the coke snorting corporates at Fox listened. From the cleverly designed marketing campaign you knew exactly the direction they were going and man did they not disappoint.This movie was so much fun. They really got the character so right because I was laughing non-stop. This was a really funny movie. Deadpool is one of the very few characters in the Marvel universe that can break the fourth wall and is self aware. And the movie really got because it is rife with meta-humour which can be seen in the very beginning with the best opening credits scene ever. And yes we see him breaking the fourth wall, making pop culture references, and slicing up bad guys. The film is not tame. The humour is nowhere near South Park levels but it does give the biggest middle finger to PC culture. The action scenes are also a lot of fun. From the sword fighting, to the shooting, to the acrobatics, they were all filmed really well. It delivers on the violence too, which is cartoonish enough but it doesn't go too much into Blade territory. Although with Wade Wilson's face, in the comics it is really boiled and deformed and here he just looks like a prune. Guess they wanted to use Ryan Reynolds as much as they could.The story is quite simple here. Its a love and revenge story. It is well paced though as it is told in a non-linear style. It somewhat slows down for me when it does get to the love story part but thankfully those scenes are mercifully short. There are some plot holes, but you really don't care because of how fun the movie is.This movie is so refreshing. I thought I was too jaded by superhero films but when you pick the right character to adapt, you can have so much fun with him or her. Honestly I really don't care about any of the upcoming Avengers films or this new X-Men film or the Superman vs Batman film because they're all so formulaic. Deadpool brought us something different and it was awesome, like a chimichanga.",10,37,80,12 February 2016
Fast Five," There we go
","So I went to watch Thor today and it was OK but then right after I went into another screen where Fast Five was playing and then thats when I felt like I paid to watch a movie.Let me quickly go through the first four films. The Fast and The Furious introduced the idea of an action film that can be done with cars readily available on the streets like the Mitsubishi Eclipse or Honda Civic. 2 Fast 2 Furious introduced the repeated villain in the franchise which is the powerful drug-lord. Fast and Furious brought in the crazy action but somehow wasn't able to expand its potential. Tokyo Drift was a complete abomination and felt completely unnecessary.Fast Five really seals in the gaps and blends all the best elements from the previous 3 (I will not include Tokyo Drift in this!!!) and wow, its a great theatrical experience.Rio was used as a setting and even though that's becoming a little played out, it's still brilliant because it allows for brilliant action sequences. Whether it's a rooftop chase in the favela, a motorcade ambush by a favela gang or an intense high speed chase sequence with two cars hauling a vault (you saw that in the trailer no big spoiler).Overall everything is so much better, character development, plot lines and story lines, action sequences and even emotion. It does go Hollywood though meaning there is a good amount of suspension of disbelief.I loved it, its good not only as a Fast and Furious film but as a film in its own merit. It took 4 films before but it finally hit the mark.",10,0,2,6 May 2011
Slumdog Millionaire," Overrated
","Couple of things.This film perpetuates the western impression of India being a wasteland just filled with vice. Nobody cares that the nation has stepped up its game in so many ways.This movie was the white man's attempt to win an Oscar and that was it. It had no message. A movie like Boyz N The Hood did show a very gritty side of Los Angeles. However John Singleton, who is a native of South Central, wanted to show what he went through when he was a child. His message was clear. This movie is pure fiction. I strongly presume that the director did not grow up in Mumbai's shanty towns.Then comes the story. I heard that Salman Rushdie, a guy who is not welcome in India and who writes stories that make no sense at all, comment that SM's story did not make sense! The story was nothing spectacular, it's the same crap I watch in Hindi films.Overrated.Plus this has to be the most pretentious use of Dutch angles.",1,33,63,12 January 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Hopefully this is the last one
","I still liked it and enjoyed it, especially in 3D but I hope there's no more to this. Each film in the series progressively pushed what was acceptable in the defilement of a Saturday morning cartoon. The first film paid way too much attention to the humans. I know they had to show less robots for budget concerns but did we really need to know about Anthony Anderson's character's grandmother? The second film really had its contrivances like the character Leo or the unnecessary sexual dialog or Sam's mother high on weed but somehow it remained a little more faithful to the show by actually mentioning things like 'Energon' or 'The Matrix of Leadership'. Now this film improved a little bit but not so much. There were still some scenes that made me uncomfortable such as when Sam was shoved into the bathroom stall by Ken Jeong's character or when Ken Jeong out of nowhere draws two pistols in front of Laserbeak or the occasional awkward dialog from Sam's mother. Still it remained faithful by adding more from the franchise such as Sentinel Prime, Mirage, the Wreckers and the Pillars. One thing I really enjoyed was the Decepticons have human allies and therefore we have our first human villain. And I didn't mind Megan Fox's replacement at all. She is actually quite tolerable and isn't bad as a first time actress seeing that she is able to cry. I actually like her because she doesn't have that look of conceit that Fox has because everyone thinks that Fox is the hottest woman on the planet. Personally, even though I think Megan Fox is hot, she still isn't the hottest. Anyways, I do hope there is no more and I think Michael Bay should move on. I want to see another Bad Boys film!",8,2,6,30 June 2011
Furious 7," Wow there are seven of these
","This is my third review of this franchise. Instead of going through the absurdity of the action set pieces, the insanely cheesy dialogue, and just the overall middle finger to logic and the laws of physics I will just talk about how I feel about the franchise itself.First of all I absolutely wholeheartedly recommend you watch this film. Yes its stupid and cheesy but the film knows it. Unlike Michael Bay's films, the Fast & the Furious films are actually tolerable. I think its because the action set pieces are properly shot with little quick cuts and shaky camera and hence do not induce headaches. The humour in these films are a lot more organic and not at the expense of stupid racist gags. The female leads while attractive are not sexually objectified. There isn't any weird fetishism involving the military. The action sequences aren't fireworks shows. And overall the, same film is not being made over and over again. Yes believe it or not there is a proper well driven plot here albeit it gets insanely convoluted. Its a revenge story but it also involves the retrieval of this God's Eye MacGuffin, I dunno. The movie knows its stupid though and boy is it really really stupid. These movies now show you can basically do anything with a car, possibly open a beer bottle as well. And the human body apparently is made of steel too as it can survive being in a car tumbling down a cliff and ... screw it you've heard me say this before in the previous review.I remember in early 2001 when I was 10 or 11 years old seeing a TV spot that had Limp Bizkit blaring in the background and people driving brightly coloured sedans starring that pretty blonde dude from Varsity Blues and the Iron Giant. This film looked stupid as it was one of those Point Break rip offs that explored a subculture. I would've never guessed it would turn into a multi billion TV show that jumped the shark. And there will be more. What you think they'll stop when there's money to be made?I'll also have to admit I got really emotional when it came to Paul Walker's story arc ending. The film really handled his send off well and did a really good job in paying him tribute. Ultimately I'm glad this was his last film and not Brick Mansions.",Null,0,14,8 April 2015
