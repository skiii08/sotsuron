3:10 to Yuma," Absolutely Moving...
","There are people who say this movie is just like any other western movie and that it tries to lure it's audience with action packed gun fights.... Obviously, these people do not understand what the movie is trying to portray. The characters were built up well from start to finish... Yea, the action scenes were pretty bizarre and not like 'real life'... But, it's a movie... and the characters' behavior and moral decisions are as real as they get... This is the story of man against the world that he knows. The moral of the story will impact you if you can look beyond what seems evident... And for some, it may even make you look at yourself....",9,1,2,9 December 2010
