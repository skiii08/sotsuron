United 93," Very good movie
","Very good movie and it looks like real event, but this is a perfect propaganda film for us , now. The event was happened but we have five years to forget it. i think this movie is second 9.11 terror on film.If we removed by this movie, many of us remember that terrors and will think our war against terrorism is right. but it is not my opinion. I felt that ,so I talked about that feeling with my friend and same.Please check your feeling and opinion. Truly American war is right ,but I can't praise this movie. If you feel good for our hero's action , maybe it have some falsehood in this movie.",8,0,2,8 October 2006
