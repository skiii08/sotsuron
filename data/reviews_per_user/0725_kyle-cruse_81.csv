The Incredible Hulk," A huge improvement over the 2003 version
","As opposed to 'Hulk,' the adaptation made in 2003, 'The Incredible Hulk' actually looks like some work was put into it. The first film had no emotion and was mostly filled with long scenes of dialogue or useless scenes with the Hulk fighting other creatures. That film also made up stuff about Bruce Banner's dad being involved in turning Bruce into the Hulk, which was never a part of the old TV shows. This film is very emotional and puts a greater focus on Bruce, not what he turns into. Unlike the first film, the cast is actually made up of known people, including Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, and William Hurt. There are also little bits of humor that make this a more fun film to watch, such as Bruce's girlfriend giving him a pair of purple shorts to wear. The action scenes are good, but not great. This is a pretty gruesome film that can be a bit disturbing to some audiences like myself, though it is still far less than 'The Dark Knight.' It can be painful to watch when the two Hulks are fighting and when Bruce is injected with the chemicals. This is not an unwatchable film, but be aware that it can be tough to watch at times. Parents take caution; it is fairly violent (not bloody) and somewhat gruesome for young audiences. Know your kids and whether or not they should see this.*** out of ****",8,4,6,22 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I personally feel it's underrated
","Most people seem to dislike this film, and I'm not entirely sure why. I personally like all of the 'Star Wars' movies, and though this is one of the lesser ones, it is still enjoyable and a well-made piece of an excellent saga. A few things seem to make people dislike this movie. One, apparently no one was expecting Anakin Skywalker to be a kid here, and though it isn't what we thought, it really doesn't affect the rest of the saga, and it shows how Anakin was influenced from an early age. Second, most people cannot stand Jar-Jar Binks. Personally, I like him, and I don't think he's any more annoying or unusual than any other comical characters from the rest of the saga (many characters from 'Return of the Jedi'). Third, Darth Maul. I might agree in this case. He is not a great villain, has no character, and is simply a disturbing person to look at. Fourth, the Podracing scenes. Though they are not essential to the plot, they are some of the most well-done scenes in the saga. They really do add to the movie. There may be other reasons people don't enjoy this film, but I've tried to justify the main ones. People seem to be missing many of this film's good points, such as Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson), one of the best characters in the entire saga, a brilliant and intelligent role as a Master Jedi. It's not a perfect film, I will agree. However, I love the dark, uncertain nature of this film, meant simply to set the stage for more great films in the saga. There are enough good points for me to enjoy the film. Not one of the best 'Star Wars' movies, but definitely one of the most underrated ones.*** out of ****",8,0,3,18 September 2008
The Sound of Music," Simply one of the best ever made
","There are few films, and few musicals, that can touch the excellence of 'The Sound of Music.' Not only is it an extremely well-written musical in itself, but this film adaptation is absolutely perfect, easily the Best Picture of 1965, and one of the very best ever made. It's hard to know where to start when a film simply has so many great elements to it. These are some of the best musical songs ever written, some of my favorites being 'My Favorite Things' and the one in which she teaches the children how to sing. The musical is based on the touching and amazing true story that has managed to inspire so many. Julie Andrews is perfectly cast (being one of my favorite actresses) and was robbed not to receive an Oscar for this role, in addition to the one she earned the previous year for 'Mary Poppins.' Christopher Plummer is also an excellent choice as the tough military father in the film. I love the tiny humorous moments, such as Plummer seeing his children in the tree or all the children falling out of the boat after seeing their father. Excellent from beginning to end. For me, it's between this and 'Singin' in the Rain' for the all-time greatest movie musical, and it's truly impossible for me to make that call. If you have never seen this, you've missed a real treat. It is a must-see for fans of musicals and movies alike. Perfect.**** out of ****",10,2,8,16 September 2008
Catch Me If You Can," Fun, fascinating film
","Based on true story of con artist Frank Abagnale, Jr. (played here by Leonardo DiCaprio) and the detective (Tom Hanks) in pursuit of him, 'Catch Me If You Can' proved to be a fun-filled, fascinating movie. Rather than telling this story as accurately as possible, Spielberg manages to spice it up with tons of little bits of humor and fascinating facts rather than just tell it as a straight story. There is enough humor here for this to be a comedy, from Abagnale pretending to be a substitute teacher to get back at some students who made fun of him to him pretending to be a former graduate from Harvard to impress his girlfriend (Amy Adams) and her father (Martin Sheen). On the other hand, there is a moving story here, dealing with the struggles in this man's life and his family. It is truly a fascinating story on its own, especially the areas regarding Abadnale's high level of intelligence, and it is a story told very well here. The film could afford to be shortened a bit, as it tends to be a little long overall, particularly with the long scenes with Abagnale and his father (Christopher Walken) and other scenes having to do with his family. The recurring Christmas theme is also somewhat unnecessary and not necessarily beneficial. Nevertheless, this is an impressive movie, one of Spielberg's best, in my opinion. Not entirely perfect, but not too far off. Worthwhile for just about anyone, especially if you like excitement as well as great character studies.***1/2 out of ****",8,1,3,16 September 2008
Ghost," Something for everyone
","Although it might sound like a clich√© phrase, I feel that 'Ghost' is a film that has something for everyone in it. Such a combination of fantasy, romance, thrills, drama, and comedy would be risky in many other films, but it works very well here. The film involves Sam (Patrick Swayze), a man who is murdered on the streets and, as a ghost, discovers that the man who killed him also plan to kill his girlfriend (Demi Moore) and rob the bank at which he worked. He attempts to communicate with a psychic (Whoopi Goldberg, Oscar-winner for this role) and get her to warn his girlfriend. The main plot is a fantasy by nature, though the cross-genres are very evident here. It is a very romantic film, and I believe that Swayze and Moore have some of the greatest on-screen chemistry I've ever seen. There are thrilling scenes involving fights for those who like action movies. The film is also decently funny at times, mostly thanks to wisecracks and situations by Whoopi Goldberg. I have never professed to be a fan of Goldberg, but this role was completely enjoyable and made the whole film even more worthwhile. It takes about 30 minutes for the film to really get going, and some parts can be somewhat bizarre, but hold on. The rest of the film is excellent in just about every way. This is an all-time favorite, and I believe everyone can find some aspect of the film they can enjoy.***1/2 out of ****",9,1,2,20 June 2009
Casablanca," The true greatest film of all time
","Although I've listed 'The Fugitive' as my favorite movie of all time, 'Casablanca' is truly the greatest. I find 'The Fugitive' to be the most interesting and engaging film I've seen, but this one has true greatness and has and will continue to endure as a true classic. Though the plot is not greatly complex, it works so well and allows the audience to focus more on the characters, which is really the greatest element of the film. Humphrey Bogart is perfectly cast, and the tough yet romantic character he plays seems to appeal to all audiences. 'Here's lookin' at you, kid' is just one of many famous lines in this film, and this movie contains the most memorable quotes of any I've seen. Claude Rains is also an excellent supporting actor as Louis, and he and Bogart were both robbed of the Oscars they deserved. The film proves to be interesting, humorous, and inspiring, and it becomes more so 'as time goes by.' See it.**** out of ****",10,3,5,9 August 2008
Citizen Kane," Incredible film-making
","Continually hailed by the critics (especially the American Film Institute) as the greatest film ever made, 'Citzen Kane' remains a classic and one of the most well-written and executed movies of all time. The film was really the first of its kind, and its simple concept of flashbacks (which is taken for granted in all films since) was revolutionized by this movie. I don't know what impresses me so much about this film, whether it's the excellent writing, the mystery that surrounds the film from the beginning, or following the reporters' path from Kane's last word to the revelation at the end. Whatever the reason, it's just a great film. Somewhat loosely based on the life of reporter William Randolph Hearst, 'Citzen Kane' can be described as a drama crossed with sort of a mystery. The techniques used in this film, including original ideas for camera angles (such as zooming in through windows) was basically created by this film. Orson Welles proved himself to be an ingenious filmmaker, though 'Citzen Kane' was largely underrated for its time, winning only a single Oscar for its screenplay rather than all nine it deserved. Is it the greatest film of all time? Not in my opinion (I choose 'Casablanca'). Nevertheless, this is truly monumental movie-making. All movie lovers need to see this film. Nearly perfect.***1/2 out of ****",9,0,1,26 August 2008
Shakespeare in Love," Very good, but...
","Here's the thing. I really enjoyed 'Shakespeare in Love.' I am a fan of Shakespeare's works, and even though I know this film is not the least bit historically accurate, I was still fascinated by this concept that Shakespeare's plays could have been inspired by a secret romance such as the one in the film. I loved watching how much his play 'Romeo and Juliet' changed throughout the film and his romance evolved the play until it became the one we all know and love. There are great performances in this film, including a best actress Oscar for Gwenyth Palthrow. For me, the most noteworthy performance is Judi Dench, an absolutely flawless and funny performance as the Queen, for which she won a much-deserved supporting actress Academy Award. I do have a few small problems with this film. First, there are a few parts in the movie that come off a bit cheesy to me, such as Shakespeare pretending to be the maid by covering his head with a sheet. Also, what about a man dressed as a woman being mistaken for the woman pretending to be a man? I don't know. It seemed cheesy to me. With things like that in the film, it doesn't seem right that the film should win Best Picture, especially when it was up against two nearly perfect nominees, 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Life is Beautiful.' All in all, a fun and fascinating film, but not perfect. Had it not won Best Picture, I probably would not critique it so much, but despite that, I recommend it, especially to those interested in Shakespeare.***1/2 out of ****",8,0,0,10 April 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," The most underrated in the series
","I really don't understand why some people don't like this film. It's definitely one of the most engaging and likable entries in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series, in my opinion. I admit I could do without the love triangle that begins to blossom between Jack Sparrow, William Turner, and Elizabeth. Nevertheless, I found the film enjoyable, without being overly long as the third film was. While Jack Sparrow's character is not played quite to the perfection of the first movie, he still throws in plenty of memorable lines here, including his 'Why is the rum always gone?' and 'You're not makin' any sense at all.' I have heard complaints about the scene on the island with the sword fight on top of the spinning wheel and how unrealistic the scene is. Who cares if it's unrealistic? These movies weren't meant to model real life. They are just for fun. To anyone who is critiquing these films too hard, just sit back and enjoy them. I have had fun watching this entry in the series, so don't go by what many critics and even fans have said about this movie.*** out of ****",8,0,1,27 June 2009
12 Angry Men," Arguably the great courtroom drama of all time
","For me, it's between 'A Few Good Men' and this for the best courtroom drama, but most likely this is it. This is not the type of film I would typically expect to even be interesting. Nearly all of the film takes place inside a single room, as one lone juror (Henry Fonda) tries to convince the other eleven that the accused party is not guilty of murder. The film is composed of nothing but dialogue, but don't let that stop you from watching it. Few films can rely this much on dialogue to keep its viewers interested the entire time. Like all great courtroom dramas, '12 Angry Men' is an intense film, not because it is action-packed but because we must watch twelve men make up their minds and weigh all of the evidence. It is intriguing what each of these men come to realize as they ponder for hours upon end. Not a bit boring. I can watch this film multiple times and still be fascinated by it each time. The acting is some of the most superb I have ever seen, causing the audience to feel the tension going on in the room in each scene. An absolutely perfect movie.**** out of ****",10,0,0,2 September 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A lovable fantasy film
","Being a fan of this book, I found 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' to be a great film version. It stuck to the story and events in the novel very well. A story like this deserves to have big-budget companies like Disney and Walden Media to make it into a great movie. The filmmakers obviously went to great lengths to find child actors that actually seemed like real children, unlike many of the young performances in films and on TV today. Liam Neeson is also the perfect voice for Aslan, the king and hero of the story (the lion of the title). Tilda Swinton is also well-cast as the White Witch; it takes a good actress to pull off an evil character like her's. Being a Christian, I love the spiritual allegory of Jesus Christ portrayed as Aslan in this film, showing the saving power and redemption He brings. It's a great film that accurately follows the original C.S. Lewis book. Some of the battle scenes at the end are a bit too long, and some of the attempts at humor in the film are too lame and annoying, both of which prevent this from being a perfect movie. Nevertheless, this is a very exciting, touching, and happy film, with a great spiritual message as well. I'm not a big fan of fantasy films, and I still enjoy it. This one is worth owning and seeing again.*** out of ****",8,0,0,9 September 2008
Dead Poets Society," Sad, though quite inspirational
","I generally find great inspiration in films like this, and 'Dead Poets Society' is no exception. Robin Williams stars as a professor who encourages his students to 'make your lives extraordinary.' This ends up causing some of the students to go too far in this direction, resulting in the 'sad' elements of this film. I did, however, feel a sense of encouragement in what Williams says, realizing that we've only got one life in this world and should make it something great. The scenes with Williams are superb, some of the best dialogue you will ever hear, in this film that won an Oscar for its screenplay. Williams was robbed of an Oscar here, though he later won one for the similar film he appeared in 'Good Will Hunting.' Though I like 'Good Will Hunting' even better, I truly enjoyed this film. The one thing I felt it lacked was enough scenes with Williams and his students. Too many scenes feature the students off on their own in their club, or getting in trouble with other students or their parents, scenes that can get depressing when there are so many of them. Fortunately, Robin Williams comes around often enough the lighten things up a bit, though this is considered one of the first of his more serious roles. The ending scene is great, as is the one with Williams telling the students to rip out part of their textbook. A nicely-done, inspiring film. Not perfect, though it is still quite good.***1/2 out of ****",8,2,2,17 September 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Not a very good sequel
","I enjoyed the first two 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies, but this one proved to be a great disappointment. 'At World's End' ended up being way too long, dull, and far-fetched. Many parts of this film are just pathetic. The first scene with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in this film, in which he is seen in Davy Jones' Locker surrounded by a bunch of clones of himself, is one of the most ridiculous excuses for a movie scene I have ever seen. There are so many side stories in this film that I just couldn't keep up with all of them. It is a very long and confusing film with few moments that hold my attention. The scene where the characters turn their ship upside down has good photography and special effects, but it is still a useless concept for a scene. Also, the bits of humor in this film are also pretty lame, compared to the ones in the first two films. These jokes suffer from poor delivery and poor writing in the first place. Every time you think this film is about to end, there is another boring scene coming your way. I don't even know why I rated it as high as I did. Obviously, this film and the previous one are meant to be seen back-to-back, or you will be likely to forget who half the characters are, as I did. Not really worth watching. Stick with the first two.** out of ****",5,1,1,20 August 2008
Yes Man," Surprisingly, it works
","Like most of Jim Carrey's films, 'Yes Man' is random, over-the-top, and silly. However, like many of his other films, this one works. It's a simple story about how a guy who always says no to everyone and chooses to spend all of his time alone is convinced to go to a club that will encourage him to say 'yes' to everything and truly live his life. As a result, he is challenged to say 'yes' to every opportunity that comes his way, which ends up advancing his job, friendships, love life, etc. No matter how much or little you know about the film, you'll probably be able to predict just about everything that will happen. Nevertheless, it proved to be a tender and uplifting story anyway. Despite the random and corny jokes throughout, I found myself laughing. This film easily stands up to Carrey's similar films ('Bruce Almighty,' 'Fun With Dick and Jane'), and is in some ways even better than those. I enjoyed the romantic parts of the film as well, with Zooey Deschanel providing a great female companion for the story. Of course this is not perfect, but a Jim Carrey film like this is one we do not (and cannot) expect to be perfect. Not great, but enjoyable, and you won't feel like you wasted your time. By the way, I could relate to Carrey in the film, understanding how he often preferred to spend his time alone. Maybe you'll relate to it as well, and enjoy it just that much more.*** out of ****",7,1,1,17 April 2009
The Terminator," Classic
","'The Terminator' is a classic 80s action movie. Yes, it's a bit cheesy, the special effects are obviously fake now, and there isn't a huge amount of character development in this film, but it's still the best of this series, in my opinion. This is considered to be a low budget film, as most of the stars were unknowns at the time. Now that Arnold Schwarzeneggar is a huge star (as well as governor), the film can be looked at somewhat as the beginning of a career. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is rescued from the Terminator by Kyle Reese, a man from the future who knows that Connor's son John will lead the rebellion against the takeover by robots in the future. The rest of the film consists of the two of them trying to escape this Terminator and the events that will result in John Connor's birth. It's still a great film, and the best of this series so far, even though it doesn't have great visual effects. There are good performances from the entire cast, and there are tons of humorous bits throughout the film that lighten up such a suspenseful, frightening story. 'Terminator 2' is an impressive sequel, but because I feel it is overly violent, I'm not going to rate it higher than this film.***1/2 out of ****",9,1,3,19 August 2008
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Impressive western film
","To tell the truth, there are very few western films that I actually see. 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is a rare exception. This film truly is not your average western. For one thing, the film does not revolve around good guys vs. bad guys the entire time. It's more of a story about Butch and Sundance themselves. The movie can be humorous at times, throwing in tons of little bits of intelligent verbal comedy, as most great films throughout time have been able to do. Robert Redford shows a side of brilliant acting with lines such as those in his 'Can I move?' scene in which he cannot simply stand still and shoot his target. Paul Newman is also especially good, interjecting some wit and sarcasm that make this film so enjoyable. This movie also introduced 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head,' one of the best original songs in movie history. Though I like Newman and Redford's second film together ('The Sting') even better, this is still a great film on its own. Perhaps it's only the film's ending that makes this movie less than perfect for me. Though it is more historically accurate, it does provide somewhat of a sense of disappointment here. Nevertheless, the rest of the film is nearly perfect, very enjoyable and worthwhile. A classic, and one of the best films of the 60s.***1/2 out of ****",9,3,5,4 September 2008
Ocean's Twelve," Way underrated
","'Ocean's Twelve' is possibly the most underrated film I've ever seen. If you haven't seen the film, watch it now (or better yet after seeing 'Ocean's Eleven'). Forgive me for giving away scenes of this film, but I cannot properly describe what I love about it without doing so. Everything about this movie is brilliant, and you won't realize that from seeing it only once. By watching it many times with my family, I've found that this film is chock-full or little surprises and ingenious quotes you won't help but remember; from the great gag with Julia Roberts pretending to be herself (including a cameo with Bruce Willis) to the Night Fox's (an excellent character) attempt to steal the artifact Danny and his gang are after, the plot and script are excellent. If you only choose to see the film once, you'll be not only confused but possibly bored with the film. Multiple viewings will cause you to see how amazing this film is. In my opinion, it's the best of the 'Ocean's' series.**** out of ****",10,7,11,11 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Underrated, and completely satisfying
","Some people have disliked this film, and I truly don't see why. 'Return of the Jedi,' does not, contrary to popular opinion, ruin the original 'Star Wars' trilogy but rather ties it up in a perfectly satisfying way. The opening scenes at Jabba the Hutt's palace are well done. Jabba is a much meaner and scarier villain here than the short clip in the 1997 re-release of 'A New Hope' showed him to be. Luke Skywalker is forced to make his most difficult choices in this film, and the intensity of the film's last half-hour is some of the most compelling film-making I've ever seen. The themes and messages of redemption and good vs. evil are superbly done here. 'Return of the Jedi' is a very exciting and engaging film, memorable and worth watching many times, especially now that Episode III has been made. It's not as perfect as the previous two Star Wars films were, but it is a very pleasing and happy conclusion to an amazing story. The fourth best in the saga, behind the two originals and Episode III. Nearly perfect.***1/2 out of ****",9,8,14,13 September 2008
Elf," So funny
","Watch 'Elf' a few times and it instantly becomes a favorite Christmas movie. At least it did for me. Nearly everything about this film is funny. An Elf (Will Ferrel) leaving the North Pole to find his real father (James Caan) is just the setup for this film. From there to the end it's straight laughs. So many great gags are formed by Ferrel's ignorance to the real world and other peoples' reactions to him. It's fast-paced and very funny. Some minor drawbacks include some gross sequences with Buddy the Elf overindulging in sweets in unappetizing ways, as well as an unnecessary scene in which he gets into a fight with a midget-sized famous author with a temper. Aside from that, it's one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in quite some time. I've seen it at least four times, and it's still just as funny. Not only is Will Ferrel well-cast for his role, but it's also great to see older stars such as James Caan and Bob Newhart make a comeback for this back. Watch it next Christmas or you'll miss out on an annual treat that is very charming and fun. Great for the whole family, and for just about anyone.***1/2 out of ****",9,0,2,8 January 2009
Ocean's Thirteen," Good, but inferior to the first two
","In my opinion, 'Ocean's 11' and '12' were two of the most fun and entertaining films I have ever seen. '12' was especially ingenious and brilliant, especially and viewing it multiple times. 'Ocean's Thirteen' is not a bad film by any means, and it manages to entertain very well and provide a lot of laughs.Several aspects of this film make it inferior to the first two movies, however. First of all, the plot element of the team trying to make a hotel rater's stay at Mr. Bank's hotel miserable sort of made me feel negatively about this film. This was an almost disgusting section of the movie (poisoning his food and putting lice on his bed) that could have been done in a less disturbing way. Also, what's with the character of the Night Fox in this film? In the previous film, he was a smart and clever character, and here he is simply made to look like an idiot. The writers could have done much better here. Most of the regular cast is good in this film, as usual. Al Pacino, though he makes a fine addition to the series, is not himself here. He neither acts nor sounds like his old self. It's hard to believe this is the same person from 'The Godfather' movies. Not really a bad film, but had it been better, the 'Ocean's' films could have been an absolutely perfect series. Still worthwhile and fun.*** out of ****",8,0,1,2 September 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Another underrated 'Star Wars' film
","The 'Star Wars' saga is easily my favorite movie series of all time, and I have found enjoyment in every installment of the saga. 'Attack of the Clones' is one of the three films in the series that I feel is underrated (the other two being 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Return of the Jedi'). To be honest, I wasn't even very interested in the 'Star Wars' films until I saw this one and decided to pay more strict attention to it. I truly enjoyed this film, and it inspired me to go back and watch the earlier ones, which I fell in love with for the first time. This is definitely not the best film in the saga, and it ties with 'The Phantom Menace' for my least favorite. Nevertheless, neither one of my least favorites is a bad film, and both are essential for the entire saga to play out. This film has some of the best dialogue of the three new 'Star Wars' films. The love theme music is some of the best original music John Williams has written for the saga in quite some time. This movie also gives Yoda the best scenes he has been given since 'The Empire Strikes Back,' particularly toward the end. It's not a perfect movie; the acting could be better, and some of the action scenes toward the end could have been cut down slightly. The film will not waste your time, however, and it is rich in character development and gives signs of what is yet to come in the saga.*** out of ****",8,1,3,17 October 2008
The Godfather: Part II," Almost as good as Part 1
","What an impressive film. I rank 'The Godfather: Part II' as the third greatest sequel I've ever seen, behind 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Toy Story 2.' Like those two films, this sequel does not attempt to use the same structure and style as the original. Godfather II shows Michael Corelone's (Al Pacino) struggle to hold his father's crime empire together as he begins to abuse his power, and this is combined with flashback scenes showing how Vito Corleone (played excellently by Robert DeNiro in an Oscar-winning role here) came to form his empire. I don't even understand why I like the film so much, as it grows more depressing and disheartening as the film goes on. Nevertheless, it is amazingly brilliant nonetheless. At almost three and a half hours long, the film is not slow-paced at all. It moves along smoothly, yet it takes plenty of time to adequately convey both stories in great detail. The flashbacks are the real highlight of this film, and watching Robert DeNiro as he begins to gain power is engaging and very interesting to watch. It's amazing how much different Michael's character is in this film from the first one. This doesn't top the first film for me, probably because Marlon Brando, who made part I so great, is not in it. Nevertheless, this is easily the best picture of 1974, and the performances are some of the best I've ever seen.***1/2 out of ****",9,1,3,20 August 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," I loved this movie
","To tell the truth, I wasn't even that big of a fan of the Jason Bourne movies until I saw this film. 'The Bourne Ultimatum' provides the perfect conclusion to what I now realize is a great series. This sequel takes place in both Russia and in America, and once again Bourne (Matt Damon) must find out who he really is while evading those chasing after him. The film is highly suspenseful and action-packed, and it provides more entertainment than your average action movie. Watching Bourne's clever ingenuity and ability to escape his enemies in the most impressive ways is what really makes this film so fun to watch. Joan Allen and Julia Stiles are great co-stars once again, as is David Strathairn (lesser known but brilliant actor from films like 'Sneakers' and 'Good Night and Good Luck'). After seeing this, I had to go back and watch the first two again, and I enjoyed them even more than before. This film, however, is easily the best of the three. It grabs your attention from the beginning and hooks you the whole way through. Few films can do that this well. Almost a perfect film.***1/2 out of ****",9,1,3,19 August 2008
Predator," Decent, but I'm afraid it could have been better
","I enjoy Arnold Schwartzeneggar movies as much as the next guy, and the Terminator films are some of my favorites. Because 'Predator' received some fairly good ratings, I decided to check it out. I admit it can be fun, and there are some good moments of humor and action. However, it's far from great, and I'll tell you why. We hardly get to know any of the characters, especially Arnold. In a movie like this, we want characters we can really care about so we can hope they'll get away from the bad guys (and the alien in this case). Secondly, Arnold's movies are usually much more chock-full of funny lines than this, which usually give the movie a reason to stick in your brain. The action scenes are pretty good, although some of the scenes with Arnold and the Predator toward the end go on a bit too long, and they seem to keep on going back and forth. This is a decent action movie if you don't want to think too much while you watch it, but if you prefer something with a bit more depth to it, I recommend the Terminator films or 'True Lies' instead.*** out of ****",7,0,1,15 May 2009
The Caine Mutiny," Well-made in most ways
","'The Caine Mutiny' is a fascinating and entertaining film that you're bound to find memorable. The crew of the a Navy ship known as the Caine receive a new Captain (Humphrey Bogart), who proves to be difficult to deal with in that he restricts the freedoms and liberties of his crew. The men of the crew begin to suspect he may be mentally ill once he begins making bad decisions in the midst of battles and storms, and they attempt to get him removed from the Caine. The film has strong parallels to 'Mister Roberts,' in that both have a difficult Captain, both involve the Captain waking up his crew for petty reasons, and both involve the crew trying to remove the Captain. This film, however, takes a slightly more serious approach, and I actually like this film better. What makes this film interesting, and even funny, is the methods used to show the Captain's perceived insanity. For example, to demonstrate strawberries he feels are missing from the ship, he uses sand, which makes the crew feel awkward and gets some laughs from the audience. I'd have to say that this film is significantly less than perfect, however, because too much is spent on telling the predictable difficult love story of one crew member, which sets up an unnecessary second plot which does not enhance or have anything to do with the first. With better overall focus, the film could have been a true masterpiece. Still a very good, well-made movie worthy of the title of classic.***1/2 out of ****",8,0,3,30 May 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Far exceeded my expectations
","Generally a second sequel like this would easily be a bomb. Truly, many of the elements of the film do not look positive, right down to Schwartzeneggar playing a different Terminator than the character in the first two films. However, I truly enjoyed watching 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.' This film does not try to fill up the entire story with useless action scenes. Instead, the action sequences are well done and fun to watch. Usually a sequel like this would lack good character development and would not focus on the people in the story enough. I felt there was significant development of the characters here, especially since this film takes place at least ten years after the events in the previous film. This film may seem a little more depressing than the previous two, but it is a lot of fun nonetheless. Schwartzeneggar plays his role just as good as he did many years ago, and I feel this is his swan song to Hollywood. This film has been needlessly criticized, when in reality, there is no reason to expect any more from it. This is a worthwhile and satisfying movie, and I hope that part 4 will pull it off just as well.*** out of ****",8,1,1,29 August 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Good sequel, though I prefer the original
","There's no reason why I should prefer the first film in this series to 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day.' Perhaps the original is more of a classic and a personal favorite to me. This sequel goes for more in-depth with plot and character development than the previous film. However, there are several reasons why this film simply cannot measure up to its predecessor. First, this is far more violent than the original. It seems that every couple of minutes someone is either getting shot, beat down, or thrown through glass. Also, I dislike the character of Sarah Connor in this film. She is shown as a far more aggressive and tough woman than in the last movie, which can be unappealing to many. The movie also drags on a little too long in the last couple of scenes and really could have ended sooner, with less action and fighting sequences. Nevertheless, the chase scenes in this movie are some of the most fun and exciting ones I have ever seen. After watching it a few times, it starts to become a classic. Most of the film's elements are masterfully done, right down to the classic scene with the Terminator entering as George Thorogood and the Destroyers' 'Bad to the Bone' plays, as well as the well-known 'Hasta la vista, baby!' Could be improved upon, but an enjoyable film that lives up to its reputation and a newer sci-fi classic.*** out of ****",8,4,6,22 August 2008
Duck Soup," Excellent comedy
","'Duck Soup' is excellent, not only one of my top five favorite comedies, but also in the top ten on my favorite movies list. However, I rate this film just slightly behind 'A Night at the Opera.' Although this film is as hilarious as it could be, I find the gags in Opera to be even more ridiculous, giving me even more to laugh at. However, this film leaves nothing to be desired. Moment after moment, the film gets more outrageous as the situations grow more and more implausible. Groucho is over the top as usual, and for me, there's nothing funnier than listening to him insult everyone who comes his way. Chico taking everyday words and mashing them together is also hysterical. Harpo is ingenious in his act as well. Even Zeppo gets a decent role in this film. 'Duck Soup' includes two of the most famous Marx Brothers acts, the mirror sequence and the final battle scene. As usual, the events stay funny right up to the end. No movie made in recent years can possibly compare to this comedy. You will laugh and laugh at this film, and there are so many verbal gags that you won't possibly remember them all, making this worth several viewings.**** out of ****",10,1,2,19 August 2008
Ocean's Eleven," One of my favorites; a truly perfect film
","Watch this film a couple of times and catch all the great one-liners and little details, and you'll realize that 'Ocean's Eleven' is brilliant. This is the movie that sort of brought back the 'caper' film, a style used in older films such as 'The Sting' and of course the original 'Ocean's Eleven.' Convict Danny Ocean (George Clooney) assembles a team of twelve men to pull off a heist to rob three Las Vegas casinos. Supporting characters like Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac (rest his soul), and Elliot Gould are all excellent, but for me it is Brad Pitt that manages to steal every scene and deliver every line in the funniest, smoothest way. Andy Garcia is also perfectly cast as Terry Benedict, the casino owner who commands authority just by his actions. This is one of the rare films that everyone in my family (Mom, dad, brother) all enjoyed equally. It's easy to watch and completely entertaining. I like 'Ocean's Twelve' even better than this film, since the comedy in that one is even more brilliant and improves ever more with each viewing. This, however, ranks nearly as high as that sequel. What a fun film. Don't miss out.**** out of ****",10,1,4,21 August 2008
Enchanted," A rare treat that comes along once in a lifetime
","Rarely do I go to the theater and see a movie as enjoyable and great as this one. Disney made 'Enchanted' as an effort to recycle some of the classic formulas and poke fun at them at the same time. It tells the story of Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) falling down a well and landing in the real world, and while waiting for Prince Edward (James Marsden) to rescue her, she meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter and both ends up learning from them and touching their lives. Not only was it hilarious watching the characters try to adapt to these situations, but the film ended up being incredibly romantic and touching. 'Enchanted' has quickly become my second favorite live action Disney film, next to 'The Parent Trap.' See this film, or you may miss out on a real treat. Close to perfection.***1/2 out of ****",9,2,2,9 August 2008
Die Hard 2," Good 'Die Hard' sequel
","I found 'Die Hard 2: Die Harder' to be quite an enjoyable film, and would rank it third best in the saga (my rank is 1, 4, 2, 3). It has great characters, memorable scenes, and a great concept for one of these films, in which John McClane must stop terrorists who have turned out the airport lights so planes cannot land until the bad guys get what they want. The film could easily have made second best in the series, but it lacks the good character development found in 'Live Free or Die Hard' and, of course, the original. Nevertheless, this proved to be an exciting movie, as most action films surrounding airplanes are (such as 'Air Force One' or 'Executive Decision'). This, however, is better than those films, mostly because we have John McClane, a character who is like a real person on the screen and keeps us engaged in his personality. The plot may be a bit unbelievable at times, since it would be more practical for the planes to land at another nearby airport. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it. I also liked how this film brought back some of the great supporting cast from part one, including Reginald VelJohnson and William Atherton. Not a perfect film like its predecessor, but entirely enjoyable and fun. Worthy of the 'Die Hard' series.*** out of ****",8,0,1,18 September 2008
Gone with the Wind," Excellent classic film
","There's very little to say about 'Gone With the Wind,' that hasn't already been said a million times before. Nevertheless, it is excellent, probably one of the best films of all time. It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and how she deals with a long-time struggle trying to get the man she loves (Ashley, played by Leslie Howard) to fall in love with her, unaware that the whole time she is actually falling in love with Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), the tough-yet-romantic character who she thought would never appeal to her. Vivien Leigh is perfectly cast here, in an Oscar-winning role in this Best Picture of 1939. She makes the character of Scarlett believable and lovable, despite the over-controlling and selfish nature she often possesses. Gable was robbed of an Oscar here, as he plays one of the most engaging, tough, and fun characters ever seen on film, delivering one great line after another (down to his famous 'Frankly, my dear...'). The supporting cast, particularly Oscar-winner Hattie McDaniel as Mammy, is perfect, and really makes the film. It's a long film, over four hours long, yet those four hours fly by as you get caught up in the drama and fascinating story of Scarlett. It's truly a classic and one film movie lovers cannot miss. Very close to perfection, composed of one great scene after another.**** out of ****",10,2,3,30 September 2008
Batman Begins," The best superhero movie ever
","I'm not a huge fan of superhero movies. Many of them turn out to be too corny or predictable. 'Batman Begins,' however, is a rare treat. This film shows how Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) conquers his fear of bats by facing his fears and becoming a superhero with bat-like ability. It's truly a fascinating story that shows Wayne from his childhood to his battle with his first villain, the Scarecrow. Christian Bale proves to be the best movie Batman ever. This film also has an excellent supporting cast, featuring Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, and my favorite, Morgan Freeman. This film includes an excellent balance between humorous and serious moments, making this a very interesting and entertaining ride. Not only my favorite Batman movie but my favorite superhero movie as well. Close to perfection, and worth multiple viewings.***1/2 out of ****",9,2,2,12 August 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Excellent depiction, but not a perfect film
","I do not see a whole lot of war movies, but 'Saving Private Ryan' is definitely an exception. This film simply has a fascinating plot and great dialogue between the soldiers. The film tells the story of a group of soldiers who must find private James Ryan (Matt Damon) and send him home to his mother, as she realizes that her three other sons were killed in battle. The rest of the film deals with issues such as deciding whether saving a man's life is worth losing several lives of your own soldiers and to what extent one must be loyal to their given orders. Tom Hanks could have (and probably should have) won an Oscar for his role, as he pulls off each scene amazingly well, as usual. The interactions between him and the soldiers, especially Private Ryan, are perfectly done, proof of Spielberg's excellent directing. What prevents the film from being entirely perfect is the overall lack of scenes with dialogue. So much of the film (at least 60%) is made up of battle scenes. Although the depictions of war are very realistic and well done, they tend to drag on too long. It's the dialogue scenes and the decisions the characters must make that make the film as great as it is, but more of those scenes are needed to keep the audience engaged. Nevertheless, an excellent depiction of war, great direction, and great acting make this a very monumental and interesting film. Definitely worthwhile and important to see.***1/2 out of ****",8,1,5,9 September 2008
Bolt," The biggest delight of the year
","It's been a while since I've been this pleased with a film I've seen in the theater. 'Bolt' was a film that all ages could enjoy. It was not only very funny but a very touching movie as well. John Travolta and Miley Cyrus were perfectly cast as the voices of Bolt and Penny, respectively. The plot twist toward the end, which I won't give away here, was one of the most pleasant movie surprises I've seen in a long time, and I had to check my tears at this point. The opening scenes are some of the most exciting action-packed scenes I've ever seen, especially for a kids movie. Aside from all of this, 'Bolt' may not be the most original movie I've ever seen. It has elements of previous Disney films, such as 'Toy Story' (1 and 2) and 'The Incredibles.' It's not entirely perfect, as some occasional supporting characters can be annoying after a while. Nevertheless, I was able to overlook all of that considering how much I enjoyed and was touched by this film. It's easily the best film Disney has released since 'Enchanted.' A few more pleasant surprises like this each year would be great. This is the first film I've seen in a while that I've been eager to recommend. Great for kids and adults, and worth paying to see at the theater.*** out of ****",8,3,7,22 November 2008
Good Will Hunting," Better every time
","I'm not sure why I like 'Good Will Hunting' so much. The plot is such a simple story of Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a young man with intelligence way beyond his years, yet all he is choosing to do with his life is cleaning the floors at his job and hanging out with his friends. After getting in trouble with the law, college professor Sean Maquire (Robin Williams, in his Oscar-winning role) is the only person willing to counsel him and turn his life around. Maybe I enjoy this film because I relate so well to it, as I am a college student unsure of what to do with my life. The film has rightly been described as a 'slow-burner,' and I would agree. It was during my second viewing that the film's greatness suddenly hit me, and I really began to like it. It entertains but also brings tears to my eyes. It has the same inspirational value as Robin Williams' earlier film 'Dead Poets Society,' for which he also should have won an Academy Award. Although I prefer this film, since it focuses more on inspiring a single person rather than an entire group, both movies are excellent. Maybe it's not an entirely perfect film, but watch this one (more than once if necessary) and be prepared to be moved.***1/2 out of ****",9,0,1,9 August 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The best of this trilogy
","Generally I'm not a fan of fantasy films, and while this series is an exception, I cannot understand why people love to sit down and watch all three of these films at once. I find each film in this series too long and drawn out. Despite that, however, all three of these films are superbly done, and 'The Two Towers' proves to be the best 'Lord of the Rings' film, in my opinion. From the opening scene, showing the details of Gandalf falling during the middle of the first film, this is a masterpiece. Everything else, from Gollum's 'My precious' to the talking and walking trees in the forest is very entertaining. The epic battle scenes toward the end, though overly lengthy, are well done, with tons of little bits of excitement and humor. This movie is filled with great film-making and story-telling from beginning to end, and it also features bits of spiritual allegories, likely inserted into the writing by author J.R.R. Tolkein. A great film, however way too long, as all the films in this trilogy are. I simply can't watch this over and over as some people can without getting bored at many of the long parts. Fantasy lovers, however, and most movie lovers will love this film and everything about it.*** out of ****",8,0,3,17 September 2008
Schindler's List," Amazing and inspiring
","Currently hailed as one of the top ten films of all time, 'Schindler's List' remains an amazing story depicting the persecution of the Jews during the Holocaust. If you ask me, the film is not truly about the Jews themselves. For me, the main part of this film deals with the man Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson, in what is possibly his best role) and the life change he endures by deciding to help out the Jews. He begins as a selfish man using the Jews to work for him so he can make a profit. As a result, he pays to save the Jews from Hitler's persecution so he can use them to work for him instead. A large number of Jews end up on his list (the list of the title) and come to work for him. By the end, however, he sees what he has done for them and wishes he had been less selfish and could have spent more of his money (which he now sees as worthless) to save the lives of more of the Jews. The scene in which he realizes this is my personal favorite scene of the film. This is where the movie is at. It makes us all wish we could do more to help. At over three hours long, this film can prove to be a bit long and slow at times, which is really the only reason I cannot call it perfect. Nevertheless, everything about the movie is perfectly well done. The depictions are very realistic and the acting is brilliant. Spielberg pulls it off once again. Hard to say if this should be the Best Picture of 1993, though. 'The Fugitive' is my personal favorite movie and I would have liked that to win. Of course, it is a film like 'Schindler's List' that truly deserves a Best Picture Oscar. Not one of the top ten of all time for me, but a must see for all.***1/2 out of ****",8,9,13,16 September 2008
School of Rock," Very funny
","I would never have thought this concept would turn out so funny. Jack Black plays an guitarist who cannot find a gig and must take a job as a substitute teacher to make ends meet. He soon starts teaching his students all about rock music and he and the class secretly for a rock band to perform in the 'Battle of the Bands.' Some of the biggest laughs come when Jack Black makes odd references to bands from several decades ago that would, in reality, go over the heads of most kids in the grade he is teaching but would easily be understand by the average adult. Black's hyper personality and hilarious remarks in the conversations with other staff members are also very funny, as he makes additional references to song lyrics and even quotes from Woody Allen. Joan Cusack is superbly cast as the school principal, suspicious yet still completely unaware of what's going on in the classroom. It's implausible that no one would figure out what the class was doing, but that's another thing that makes this film so funny. Parents, there are occasional sex and drug references, so you may want to wait until your kids are old enough to know better, which depends on the age and maturity of your individual children. Otherwise, see this film. It's one of the funniest movies made in the last five years.***1/2 out of ****",9,0,0,21 August 2008
Amadeus," What a great film
","There simply aren't enough good things to be said about 'Amadeus.' This is an Oscar-winning Best Picture that truly lives up to its reputation, and is a personal favorite as much as a critical one. This film is full of fascinating (and funny) scenes, one of my favorites being Mozart (Tom Hulce) playing Salieri's (F. Murray Abraham) piece from memory after hearing it once and criticizing it somewhat unintentionally. An example of how great the film-making in this movie is involves the scene where Salieri helps Motzart finish his composition as he lies in bed dying. What Salieri learns from this is simply amazing, and it doesn't deserve to be spoiled here. The film is masterfully told in flashback, as Salieri reports the story as an old man in a confession to a priest. The film is not really a true-to-life biography of Motzart's life, and many of the interesting little facts, as well as the whole plot element of Salieri conspiring against Motzart, are more or less implied, speculated, or just plain made up. That's not the point, however. The film takes a true story that would ordinarily bore audiences and turns it into a movie that is highly entertaining, funny, and remarkable. I'm sure many people can relate to Salieri and what he must feel, knowing that in real life, there is always someone better than us. This Oscar-winning role makes the character of Salieri completely believable, allowing us to feel the envy that grows throughout the film and the redemption he feels toward the end. The only drawbacks to this movie are the mediocre acting jobs done by a few of the supporting characters, such as Motzart's wife, which don't really fit with the great acting done by the lead characters. Nevertheless, this does not ruin the movie by any means. This is highly recommended, even to those who don't tend to like biography or history films. Almost perfect.**** out of ****",10,1,2,4 December 2008
Moulin Rouge!," Incredibly different, and I loved it
","It was hard to know what to expect with 'Moulin Rouge!' and truthfully, nothing could have been expected. It's a totally unique film in just about every aspect. The film is a musical that maintain's the typical musical feel that goes along with such a love story as this, but what made it different was the fact that none of the musical was original. All of the songs are fairly contemporary, including such tunes as 'All You Need is Love,' 'I Will Always Love You,' and my favorite from this film, 'Come What May.' I would never have thought such a thing would work, but believe me it does. I couldn't help smiling throughout just about every musical number in the film, and the spontaneous singing or songs we all know but could never have predicted in such a film as thing made it even more delightful. Plot-wise, the story is similar to such things as 'Shakespeare in Love' (in which the play being written in the film is being inspired by the main characters' secret romance) and 'West Side Story' (in which the main characters cannot be together due to forbidden love and such). However, it was the way this film was made that made it feel so original, with the quick and unexpected scenes such as characters suddenly falling in through the roof and the quick pace at which the film goes by. The music made the film for me, and Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman had perfect chemistry. I admit that it might be bizarre at times, which may turn some people off, and it is still a tragic story, but I loved it anyway. Wow, it's hard to know what else to say about this film, expect that it became an instant favorite and is a must-see for movie lovers. It was robbed of Best Picture. We don't see many films this unique, or this good, anymore.***1/2 out of ****",9,0,1,20 June 2009
Patton," Flawless
","How does one make a war movie that both depicts the truths about war and entertains its audience at the same time. It's hard to say, but 'Patton' does just that. I feel that this film captures much of the true essence of General Patton, played perfectly in an Oscar-winning performance by George C. Scott. Although I don't necessarily like his foul mouth, I think it accurately recounts who he really was. The film makes him overbearing and gives him a sense of humor, making him real and someone we love to watch on screen. This film manages to entertain very highly, throwing in tons of details, down to Patton's wimpy little dog, to keep us interested the entire time. At nearly three hours, the film flies by. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Some scenes, such as Patton slapping another soldier, may be controversial to some, but they make it all the more interesting and thought-provoking for me. 'Patton' is a rare film that gives me no reason to mark it down at all from a perfect rating.**** out of ****",10,1,3,26 May 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Great depiction
","'Good Night and Good Luck' proved to be a very accurate and engaging film telling about 50s TV host Edward R. Murrow. Brilliant actor (though lesser known) David Strathairn, from films like 'The Bourne Ultimatum' and 'Sneakers' is perfectly cast here and has his role as Murrow down perfectly, right down to his gestures and ways of speaking. It has a feel similar to 'All the President's Men,' as a documentary meant simply to tell the true story. This film does not really attempt to go into grave details about much of Murrow's personal life or the lives of any working with him. The film is not necessarily meant to entertain, though it does at times. I was surprised that a film like this managed to squeeze all of the facts of the true story into a 90-minute movie. It is not boring; it is not long enough to become boring. The supporting cast, including Robert Downey, Jr., Jeff Daniels, and George Clooney (also director) is excellent and very realistic. Strathairn was robbed not to win the Oscar for this superb depiction of Murrow. Not absolutely perfect, but rarely do I see a film like this that doesn't have many dull spots. Worth seeing, one of the best documentary-like films I've seen.*** out of ****",8,0,0,17 September 2008
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," It surprised me, being a fan of the original
","I have been a fan of the movie 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' for many years now. I have also taken great pleasure in reading the novel by Roald Dahl. After seeing previews for this film, I had doubts that a remake like this would work for me. I thought I would love the original too much to like anything about this film. Nevertheless, I was wrong about 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.' I was uncertain about Johnny Depp playing Willy Wonka, not sure he had the right potential for this particular character. Depp actually played the role superbly, creating a character so over-the-top and zany that I'm sure Roald Dahl would have been pleased. Freddie Highmore plays Charlie very well also, coming across as the innocent, poor boy made manifest by the book as well as the original movie. AnnaSophia Robb also stands out to me as Violet Beauverguard. This version also restored some sections of the book not made into film in the original version, such as the story of how Willy Wonka found his Oompa-Loompas and building a chocolate castle for a rich prince. Also, this film adds a great new story that is both touching and fascinating, the story of Willy Wonka's dad (Christopher Lee), the dentist who drove him to rebel and create a chocolate factory. This is actually my favorite section of this movie. Not a perfect movie, as the original was for me. I miss many of the original songs such as 'Pure Imagination' from that film. Nevertheless, this film did not try to copy that one but rather relied on the novel. If you're uncertain about this remake, take it from a fan of the original: this one is worth seeing.*** out of ****",8,3,4,18 September 2008
Rudy," One of the better football movies
","My pastor once said that the only time guys are willing to admit they cried is while watching the end of 'Rudy.' This is one of the better football-themed movies I have seen, mostly because it does not revolve around the tired old plot of a football team who must overcome their differences and work together to win the game. Instead, the focus here is on one person (Rudy, played nearly perfectly by Sean Astin) and how he proves he can make it to Notre Dame and play on their football team, despite what everyone said. The plot is still typical and predictable, but how well the filmmakers took a true story and turned it into something engaging and watchable is what makes this a worthwhile film. What this film teaches us is that we cannot wait around for our dreams to fall into our laps. We must work for them. Rudy had to work to get better grades, get admission to Notre Dame, get a job just to know the field better, and eventually convince the coach to let him play. It's Rudy's interactions with those he comes into contact with throughout the movie, and the effort he puts forth to everything he does, that makes this film good. Not outstanding in every way, but inspiring and uplifting, and it has a great, memorable film score as well.*** out of ****",8,0,0,26 June 2009
The Dark Knight," Don't know why I'm justifying it
","After seeing 'The Dark Knight,' I left the theater disturbed and even a bit depressed. Because of that, I cannot understand the large mass of hysteria that surrounds this film. It's really not all bad. There are great action scenes (such as one with Batman escaping a building by attaching to a plane and flying away), as well as some good moral choices made by some characters (such as the passengers on two boats deciding not to destroy each other when the Joker threatens to blow they both up if they do not). Christian Bale plays Batman/Bruce Wayne very well once again, and my favorite supporting actor from 'Batman Begins,' Morgan Freeman, is also excellent. I found much of the film disturbing, however. The Joker (Heath Ledger) was just plain bad. It's really not a good performance, a bit too put on and exaggerated, and I don't feel Ledger did as well as everyone claims. The site of Two-Face after the incident that burned him was extremely disturbing, and I still cannot get that image out of my mind. I'm still giving it a fair rating, because the action scenes and some of the characters are somewhat interesting, but it's far below the last film for me. Do not take the kids to this one. You won't want them to witness this film. For mature viewers, still take caution, and you may enjoy some of it.*** out of ****",7,4,12,15 August 2008
Toy Story," The funniest, most creative, and most intelligent family film ever
","Being a monumental achievement in modern film-making, 'Toy Story' also proves to be the greatest family film I have ever seen. It is truly a brilliant concept. Young Andy's cowboy doll Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) becomes jealous when Andy starts paying more attention to his new space toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). Buzz, however, does not grasp the fact that he's actually a toy and thinks he is a space ranger here by mistake. Hanks and Allen are the perfect voices for these characters, as are Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, and numerous others. There are more great one-liners in this film than any other family film I can recall, one of the best being Buzz's 'I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school.' I have seen this film countless times, and it has become a true classic. It's masterfully done, not only being the first fully computer animated film, but also for it's superb writing and concept. Everything about the film, from the staff meeting scene in the beginning to Buzz seeing his TV ad, is perfectly done. Randy Newman's three original songs are all excellent. 'You've Got a Friend in Me' lost to Pochahontas' 'Colors of the Wind,' which I also love, but I'm not sure which was better; maybe this. Anyway, see this film. It's a treat to all ages.**** out of ****",10,1,2,20 August 2008
Singin' in the Rain," Possibly the best movie musical of all time
","It's between 'The Sound of Music' and 'Singin' in the Rain' for the best movie musical, in my opinion. It's difficult to choose, but this might be it. This film proves to be so funny that it could make a great comedy on its own. However, the songs really add something to the story and now I can't imagine the film without them. In an Oscar-nominated performance, it is Jean Hagen that cracks me up the most and really steals the show. She can't sing and act, but she can certainly make an audience laugh. Watching the three main stars (Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds) sing 'Good Morning' is one of my favorite moments of the film, not to mention Kelly's 'Singin' in the Rain' scene being one of the most famous moments on film. Donald O'Conner's 'Make 'em Laugh' is one of the most unforgettable musical numbers anyone will ever see. No other musical in history has a great a combination of comedy and great songs as this one, in my own opinion. Considered one of the top ten films ever made, it's a personal favorite to me as well. Possibly better than 'The Sound of Music,' but it's hard for me to make that call.**** out of ****",10,1,2,28 August 2008
Toy Story 2," One of the best sequels of all time
","Good sequels are rare enough, but I can't think of another Disney sequel that comes even close to its original.

At Al's apartment, he meets his roundup gang (Jessie, Bull's-eye, and the Prospector). Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the toys attempt to rescue, and Woody must choose to come back with them or join his roundup gang again. The film is clever and full of references to many, many popular films. I still can't believe how much work must have been put into this film, including the clips of Woody's old TV show, some of the best scenes in the movie. The best movie sequel since 'The Empire Strikes Back.' If you've never seen this, you're in for a wonderful and memorable treat. Not as good as part one, but still excellent.

Up," After three lesser entries, well deserved
","Pixar has, in my opinion, delivered the finest computer animated films to date. However, Pixar's three entries before this film ('Cars,' 'Ratatoille,' and 'Wall-E', though most people will disagree with me on the last one) were, I feel, lesser entries. The last three did not have the overall appeal value that the previous films ('Toy Story,' 'Finding Nemo,' etc) had. 'Up' is a pleasant surprise in nearly every way. What a fantastic concept this film has, featuring a house floated away by a massive amount of small helium-filled balloons (I mean, who doesn't think it would be neat to have their house fly?) Of course, a great concept deserves an equally well-written plot and screenplay, and this film pulls off both of those. The film involves Carl, an old man trying to keep his late wife's dream alive by going to Paradise Falls to prove that their childhood hero, explorer Charles Muntz, was not lying when he said he had traveled there. Along the way, he picks up a young boy scout and a few animals to continue the journey together. This film features who is probably the all-time greatest movie dog character, Dug, a dog who says just what he thinks due to his automated voice collar. What a brilliant concept, rather than the overused one involving animals talking with moving lips. There's too much to share about this film in one review, but the most important thing to say is that I recommend it. It's visually stunning and full of laughs, excitement, and real emotion, with characters we learn to care about. If you're one of the few people who hasn't seen it yet, now's the time, while it's still in theaters.***1/2 out of ****",8,0,0,17 July 2009
Some Like It Hot," Funny, but...
","Don't get me wrong; this is a very funny film. The situations these characters find and put themselves in are simply ridiculous and outrageous, making 'Some Like it Hot,' a very enjoyable movie. Jack Lemmon is perfectly cast as usual, and delivers one great line after another as in just about every film he's in. Marilyn Monroe is brilliant here and proves to be a much greater actress than I would have thought. Tony Curtis also does very well in his role, and is very funny in claiming to be the owner of the Shell gas stations. My only problem with this film is the general job of acting done in this film. Somehow a lot of the movie just didn't come off as very realistic to me. In another film involving men disguising themselves as women ('Tootsie'), everything that happens seems believable and real. Here the acting by most of the supporting cast does not seem real to me. I personally find a film funnier if I can imagine all of the events really happening. Nevertheless, I guess it's just a comedy and shouldn't be critiqued too hard. There are plenty of laughs in this movie and I enjoyed it very much. I don't agree with the AFI's decision to name it the #1 comedy of all time, but it's not too far off. Not perfect, but you'll laugh at so many things here it really won't matter.***1/2 out of ****",8,1,3,9 December 2008
Pulp Fiction," Gets better the more I see it
","'Pulp Fiction' is one of those films that starts to grow on me because I fall in love with a few particularly good scenes. I do not consider the whole movie to be enjoyable to watch, as some scenes (such as the ones with Bruce Willis running from his boxing opponent and the scenes after John Travolta kills a man by mistake) are just brutal and are no fun to watch. However, when I consider the more entertaining scenes, like Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta having normal conversations on their way to do their job as hit men (making them seem like ordinary people, as they truly are), or the entertaining date scene with John Travolta and Uma Thurman, I realize that this film is full of little humorous, entertaining, and brilliant scenes that make it a pretty good film overall. The finest thing about this film, in my opinion, is the final scene in the diner. I was completely surprised to find out that this film has somewhat of a redemptive message, a choice that Samuel L. Jackson must make after witnessing what he calls a supernatural event. That was powerful. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are excellent in their roles, and both steal the scene whenever they are on. Not all of this film is good, but these scenes I've mentioned and several others make it worthwhile and fun. You may want to watch it more than once, as this film is somewhat of an acquired taste, and you won't realize how good it is until you've seen it a few times. If you do not want to see such strong violence or hear so many 'f' words, as I don't, some TV stations occasionally show this film with those areas toned down. It's much easier to watch that way.*** out of ****",8,0,1,16 August 2008
Titanic," Mostly historically accurate, but badly focused
","When this film first came out, I was a Titanic buff and read as many books and saw as many documentaries on the actual ship as I could get my hands on. As I result, I realized the great lengths James Cameron went to in order to make 'Titanic' as historically accurate as possible, in terms of the events of the ship itself. The film is perfectly done in that way, as it is the most realistic film about the Titanic ever made, in my opinion. Nevertheless, it is not nearly a perfect film, and I'll tell you why. All the young girls in the world will kill me for this, but I feel that the film is far too focused on the fictional romance between Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). This is not the first time a fictional story has found its way into a Titanic film (take the 1953 version with Clifton Webb for example). Being such a buff on the real Titanic, I did not like how so much of the film was focused on this story. What I really wanted was true historical facts about the tragedy shown on film. The story does not really need to be spiced up. It is tragic and fascinating, with tons of little interesting details, all on its own. It is truly a great story simply written by God himself. If you enjoy the romance between Jack and Rose, you're not alone. That seems to be why most people love this film. Nevertheless, I found all of the facts about the Titanic in this film to be completely accurate and well-portrayed. It is a worthwhile film for just about anyone. Not worthy of all 11 Oscars, though. 'Good Will Hunting' is what should have won that year. Of course, this does have that great original song 'My Heart Goes On,' definitely worthy of its Oscar.*** out of ****",8,3,5,10 September 2008
The Untouchables," The best gangster film I've seen
","In my opinion, 'The Untouchables' is the best gangster film I have seen. While I love the inside look of the Mafia seen in 'The Godfather,' I enjoy this film so much more. 'The Untouchables' manages to entertain rather than simply tell a story. Also, I like looking at a gangster from the point of view of the police (the good guys) rather than from their own point of view, as this is a more typical way to see the bad guys. Kevin Costner, Andy Garcia, Charles Martin Smith, and Robert DeNiro are all great, but it is Sean Connery as Malone (in an Oscar-winning role) that really steals the show. The film proves to be somewhat funny as well as dramatic, which gives proper balance and causes the audience to enjoy the movie more. It tells the story of how law enforcer Elliot Ness (Costner) and his team of 'untouchables' try to bring down mob leader Al Capone (DeNiro). The film is full of emotion, as well as humor, and manages to satisfy its audience. Almost a perfect film, and a classic for sure.**** out of ****",10,2,4,9 August 2008
The Godfather: Part III," Fair sequel with good moments
","The first two films of the Godfather saga were close to perfection, some of the most masterful movies ever made. Although part three is a big step down from those films, it has redeeming qualities that allow me to give it a passing grade. This sequel involves Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) trying to at last free his family from the world of crime and find someone to take over leading the family business. Michael's most likely successor is his nephew Vincent (Andy Garcia), the son of Michael's brother Sonny (James Caan's character from the first film). This is the area of the film that proves to be interesting, as these two characters expand on the details of events and people in the first two films and give us information we did not really go into in those movies. For example, they discuss Michael and Sonny's relationship and Michael's short-lived marriage before Kay. These discussions are truly fascinating. I disagree that the film is too long, as I think this movie, as well as the first two, move along at a fairly quick pace. It proves to be interesting enough to sit through without really getting bored. My first problem with this film, however, is casting the director's real-life daughter Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter in the film. Her acting was pretty unrealistic and did not fit with the brilliance the rest of the cast seemed to have. Also, I dislike how the film chose to end. It felt as though the whole of the saga was not really resolved, that all three films were building up to nothing. It's truly not a bad film, but it doesn't have the masterful work the first two had. It still proves to be worthwhile, and hey, who really expects the third film to be the best anyway.*** out of ****",7,0,1,22 August 2008
Die Hard," The best action movie I've seen
","Now this is what action movies are all about. 'Die Hard' stars Bruce Willis as New York officer John McClane, a cop who gets trapped in a high-rise in LA when terrorists come to steal a substantial sum from the building's safe. He single-handedly ends up defeating the entire team of terrorists. Although the film's action scenes are great (especially the classic one involving McClane jumping out of the building holding onto a fire hose), it is the interactions between McClane and Sergeant Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) and villain Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) that make the movie what it really is. Rickman plays one of the greatest movie villains, as he combines evil with humor, as every villain should. His performance was Oscar-worthy, in my opinion. It's great dialogue and fun characters that set 'Die Hard' apart from most other action movies. Its three sequels are all great too, but this film is still superior. Always in my top 5.**** out of ****",10,4,4,9 August 2008
There Will Be Blood," I honestly could not stand it!
","Rarely do I admit to hating a film. I can generally find at least I few things that made it worthwhile. 'There Will Be Blood,' however, is an unusual exception. I did not enjoy one minute of this film, and I'm not necessarily the type of person that dislikes this type of film. From the beginning, it does not, and cannot, grab our attention. The plot deals with a series of events that cause oil man Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) to care more and more about his fortune and less about the people around him. His character, although played well, is nowhere near Day-Lewis' best work. The film is too real and hard to watch, and it drags on because there is not a single character we are really able to feel sorry for or care about. By the end, I found myself fast-forwarding just to get to the credits so I would be done with it. The ending, without spoiling, is terrible and not edifying. I couldn't believe it just ended there. Do not watch this film. You will not get anything out of it that I will not tell you here. Bottom line, don't let your fortune control your life and turn you into a monster. One of my least favorite films and not recommended. You'll have a hard time getting through it, and for what? * out of ****",3,0,2,15 July 2009
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Exciting sequel, though probably my least favorite in the series
","You know 'Die Hard' is a good series when even the least good sequel is still a very good film. The action in 'Die Hard With a Vengeance' never slows down for a minute. Not only is Bruce Willis nearly as good as John McClane as he was before, but now we have the great Samuel L. Jackson to add more great elements to the film. His fights with McClane make the movie and manage to entertain to the fullest. Jeremy Irons also plays a great villain as Simon, telling riddles to intimidate McClane before setting off bombs that threaten to destroy New York City. He still cannot measure up to the brilliance of Alan Rickman's villain from the first film, but he is easily the second-best villain in the series. The action scenes are great, particularly the race to stop the subway from blowing up. The scene at the pay phone is very exciting as well. It is inferior to the original, as well as the other two sequels, however. This film lacks great scenes of character development like the first film had. All the dialogue scenes here are mainly used as arguments between Willis and Jackson. Also, the action gets very tedious after a while, and the viewer may be too stressed after so many races through the streets. It is very enjoyable nonetheless. Action movie lovers will embrace this film. What an exciting ride, worthy of this great film series.*** out of ****",8,0,0,16 September 2008
Jaws," A horror film I actually like
","Most horror films are just brutal or disgusting, with the whole movie just consisting of people being brutally attacked by the horrifying creatures. 'Jaws' is an enormous exception. In this film, Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) who refuses to close down a New England beach over 4th of July weekend due to a recent shark attack. After more attacks, he, a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss), and the owner of a boat (Robert Shaw) set out to destroy the shark. The shark is not even really seen for over an hour into the film, making the concept of a shark rather than the shark the source of the horror, a sense of brilliance not found in most horror movies. Also, the film revolves more around the characters and the decisions they must make to deal with the situation, which really brings about a more interesting aspect of the film. Audiences don't want a film to dwell on the horrifying objects that can't communicate; they want to expand on characters and people. That's what makes this such a great film. It's intense, a bit scary, and has little bits of humor throughout that make it fun to watch. The ending proves to be a bit too intense for me, so I don't feel it's absolutely perfect, but very close.**** out of ****",10,12,20,19 August 2008
Hitch," One of my favorite romantic comedies
","'Hitch' is a unique romantic comedy that I found completely enjoyable. It was one of the rare ones that is equally funny and romantic, and it wasn't overly predictable. A good feel-good movie like this puts the main characters in situations many of us would love to find ourselves in, such as Kevin James' (who you may recognize from the recent 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop') scene with the girl he loves in the meeting room. The plot revolves around Will Smith as 'Hitch,' the 'date doctor' who tries to place other guys in situations where they will find it easier to get a date with a girl they are in love with. However, as his own romance with Eva Mendes takes off, he finds love to be a difficult thing for him personally. What I loved about this film was that there are really two different love stories the film is following, yet we are inclined to care equally about both of them. Smith and Mendes have good chemistry, and the supporting cast works very well too. Kevin James is an easily likable character that many of us are can relate to and easily feel for. I could have done without a few sequences, such as Will Smith's allergy to fish and some of the stories of his previous romances at the beginning, but the movie doesn't give me too much room to complain. Entertaining and romantic, and this film combines those two very well.***1/2 out of ****",8,0,1,20 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Far better than it could have been
","I had been anticipating 'Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith' since 'Attack of the Clones' came out in 2002. That was when I really got into this saga and couldn't wait for the final film to be made. Despite that, I always feared that this film would be extremely disturbing and hard to watch, based on what I had read about the events that would take place in Episode III. Though the film was depressing and dramatic in parts, I was actually not bothered by that as much as I thought I would be. This film ended up having some of the best action scenes in the entire saga. For example, the battle between Mace Windu and Emperor Palpatine is one of the most exciting and fun-to-watch scenes in the series, not to mention Obi-Wan and Anakin's long-anticipated battle at the end. In any other case, I would hate to know how a movie is going to end before seeing it, but here, the ending is already well-known, and we are simply seeing the film to know how the events from Episode II are going to lead up to those of 'A New Hope.' The main problem with this film is the poorly-written dialogue, which doesn't seem to fit with that of the rest of the 'Star Wars' films. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed this film greatly and found it to be very well made. Anakin's downfall is made believable in this film, and the story is very interesting and kept me engaged for the entire time. Easily the best of the three newer 'Star Wars' films, and the third best of the entire saga (behind 'A New Hope' and 'The Empire Strikes Back'). Pretty close to perfect.***1/2 out of ****",9,1,2,28 August 2008
WALL¬∑E," Actually quite impressive; brilliantly done
","While I have heard mostly great comments on this film from people I know, a few have brought up the fact that there is little dialogue in the film overall. While I would I agree with that, it truly did not affect my enjoyment of the film. 'WALL-E' is actually a brilliant little film, easily the best Pixar film made since 'The Incredibles' ('Cars' and 'Ratatouille' were okay but definitely lacked what some of the earlier films had). Watching WALL-E (the last remaining robot on earth sent to clean up the trash and rubble after all of mankind has evacuated) collect artifacts such as toys and videotapes ('Hello Dolly') was fascinating for me. This is truly a culturally-relevant film, commenting on our society and where we could end up (fat) if we don't change our ways. There are little funny moments that made the film enjoyable for me, such as the captain of a spaceship assuming that seeds on earth grow pizza. The romance between the two robots was not as annoying or corny as I would have thought, and I found myself truly hoping they would be happy together. Not an absolutely perfect film, but manages to entertain in a unique way most of us do not expect. Not Pixar's best, but certainly the best we've seen from them in several years. A worthwhile, fun, impressive film, good for families and adults. This looks like a future classic.*** out of ****",7,0,2,12 September 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," Just great
","Always a favorite of the members of this site, 'The Shawshank Redemption' has proved itself to be much more than your average film about prisoners. It took me a bit of time to reflect on this movie before I truly realized how great it was. In this film, Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man sent to prison after being falsely accused of murder. He meets Red (Morgan Freeman in one of his best roles), and the two of them leave prison many years later as changed men. I can't explain what sets this film apart from so many films like it, but it simply fascinates me. Watching Andy bring redemption to himself and the other prisoners and his clever methods of escaping from prison are wonderfully done, especially when you don't realize until later what he is doing. Perhaps my favorite scene of the film is when Morgan Freeman gives his final speech on why he should be let out of jail, as this truly displays how much he has changed throughout the film. His choice of words is brilliant, and the scene can't help but make the viewer think. The film could be cut down a bit, as some of the scenes are fairly unnecessary and repetitive. However, even if you don't think the film is anything special the first time you see it, give it some time. 'The Shawshank Redemption' gets better and better the more you reflect on it in your mind, and the second viewing will prove it.***1/2 out of ****",9,1,2,15 August 2008
The Iron Giant," Just a great family film
","I have truly enjoyed this film since I first saw it many years ago. It manages to entertain to the fullest, and not a single scene is too stupid or annoying for the average audience to watch. Adults, especially those growing up in the 50s or 60s, will relate well to this film, knowing what it was like to grow up during the trials and uncertainties of the Cold War. 'The Iron Giant' tells the story of young boy Hogarth Hughes befriending a gigantic metal robot who has crash-landed on the earth from space. The government is suspicious, as usual, and wants to destroy the robot. Hogarth teaches the robot the truths and choices of using his powers for good rather than evil. What makes up this film is a very fun collection of humor and suspense. The humor is top-notch, from Hogarth saying grace and trying to hide the robot's missing hand at the same time to Hogarth's hyped-out experience after drinking espresso. It is also compelling and touching, as Hogarth and the giant must make choices and learn lessons throughout the film. What an enjoyable film. Worthwhile for just about any family audience, and just about anyone in general.*** out of ****",8,0,1,11 September 2008
Shrek," Not bad, but I don't get why people love it
","I found some very funny things to laugh at in 'Shrek' and managed to enjoy it somewhat. However, I simply don't understand why people are so crazy about this film. It's funny, but not that funny. Often times it comes off as just annoying and not very funny, with crude humor and jokes that don't make me laugh much at all. It can be a fun film, with great lines that you'll remember forever, particularly those from Donkey (Eddie Murphey), such as 'I'm makin' waffles' or 'Pick me, pick me.' Those lines are great, but I personally don't see this as a monumental film at all. Sure, it entertains, but I don't see how it revolutionizes Hollywood. Eddie Murphey is a perfect voice for Donkey, but Mike Meyers doing a strange accent for Shrek just comes off odd to me. Cameron Diaz is also as annoying as always, and I wish her character was more lovable. It would move the film along better. Without giving it away, the way Lord Farquod is done away with (killed) is very unappealing and sudden to me. The ending doesn't really work. All in all, enjoyable, but not a film that should be so big and popular. Worth watching, but I didn't find it as monumental as most people seem to.*** out of ****",7,0,0,16 September 2008
Iron Man," Great superhero film
","While I'm not a huge fan of superhero movies, some of them prove to be worthwhile. 'Iron Man' has plenty of moments that make it an enjoyable film to watch. The scenes toward the beginning feature Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., who plays his role well) building an iron superhero suit inside a cave to protect himself from his enemies who have captured him. These are some of the best scenes in the film, as it is fascinating to watch him build this suit from scratch. Toward the middle of the film, Stark tries to improve on his outfit, and watching his many failed attempts get somewhat boring after a while. The movie picks up with good action scenes toward the end. The final scene, without giving it away, is also brilliantly done. There are also plenty of good laughs as well. There are funny moments, such as Stark asking for a cheeseburger after returning home. It's well worth seeing, and I enjoy it even more each time I see it.. Stay after the credits for a final scene; this one is worth waiting for.***1/2 out of ****",8,1,3,20 August 2008
The Emperor's New Groove," Not just one of the funniest Disney films, but one of the funniest movies of all time
","Talk about one laugh after another. Few films, particularly family films, in the past few years have come off as funny to me as 'The Emperor's New Groove.' Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade, excellent) is a selfish ruler turned into a llama by a former employee after firing her. That's a funny enough concept on its own, but its simply the over-the-top, ridiculous characters that make this as hilarious as it is. Kuzco's overly selfish nature, such as him scribbling out characters on the screen so we can focus on him, is simply hilarious. Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her assistant Kronk, simply hysterical as a childlike supporting character that steals every scene he is in, are both great. There are just too many laughs in this film to describe in a review, and not a single one of them deserves to be spoiled here. I'll just tell you to see it now. Your whole family can enjoy it and laugh and laugh. Not quite perfect, because of a few annoying scenes, particularly with Pacha's (John Goodman) kids and a few poor attempts at humor here. Despite that, it's a very, very funny movie. One of Disney's best, and simply one of the most hilarious films I have ever watched.***1/2 out of ****",9,1,2,16 September 2008
Bruce Almighty," Actually better than you might expect
","'Bruce Almighty' looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry at God and is given divine powers by him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and though it isn't his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he does excellent with what he is given to work with. Although crude at times, the film does have quite a few laughs, from Bruce parting his soup in half like the Red Sea and the customers' reactions to him, as well as Freeman's seemingly laid-back and wisecracking image of God. It is overly exaggerated at times, and there is some crude humor, but overall it manages to be somewhat funny. There is a decent supporting cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, which always helps. The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear-jerking, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and 'be the miracle.' The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable, and far better than I and many people probably would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film.*** out of ****",7,10,15,18 September 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Second best in the series
","It took me over a year of watching this film to decide that it is my second favorite in the 'Die Hard' series (I rank them 1st, 4th, 2nd, 3rd). 'Live Free or Die Hard' is still inferior to the original, but this part four has become a favorite of mine. I honestly wasn't sure how good this film would be. I felt Bruce Willis was getting too old to play John McClane anymore, and I thought this concept of bad guys virtually shutting down the U.S. would be too serious for a somewhat humorous action film like this one. Nevertheless, this film works really well. It's better than parts 2 and 3 because it has a greater amount of character development. The action scenes are some of the most memorable ones you will ever see (the helicopter scene, the chase with the jet on the freeway, etc.). Justin Long proved to be a way better co-star than I would have expected, and he adds a more hip type of humor to lighten up this film. Bruce Willis plays his role nearly as good as he first did 20 years ago. It's not nearly a perfect film, however, since the bad guys lack the humor and brilliant acting that Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) had in the first film. Fortunately, the violence and language in this film are far less than that found in the first three films. A fun film, and the best 'Die Hard' since the first one, but not nearly as monumental as that one.*** out of ****",8,0,1,20 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the best movies ever made
","Always in my top five, 'Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope' is what sci-fi, action, and movies in general are all about. Even after two great sequels and three good prequels, this is still the best 'Star Wars' film. I love the simple plot of this film that gets an entire saga going. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) needs help in her rebellion against the galactic empire and sends her droids R2-D2 and C-3P0 (probably the two best non-human characters in film history) to get Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to help her. Along the way, they become property of and friends of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Eventually they all meet up and begin their battle against the empire. I don't know if it's the greatness of the characters, the plot, or the visuals of this film that make it such a classic, but it is. I can't explain why, but it still tops all of the other 'Star Wars' films for me. It's truly a perfect movie. The best film of 1977 (in my opinion) and one of the best films of all time. I doubt anyone reading this hasn't seen the film, but if you haven't, you're missing out on something wonderful.**** out of ****",10,0,0,19 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The greatest sequel of all time
","Like the original 'Star Wars' film, 'The Empire Strikes Back' always finds itself inside my top ten. It's extremely close in quality to 'A New Hope,' but I place this film just slightly below that one. This is however, in my opinion, the greatest sequel ever made. Like all great sequels, it doesn't try to be too much like its original. This film has a completely different feel to it, and it proves to be far more dramatic and intense than the last film. In this film we are introduced to one of the most well-known and most-imitated characters of the saga (and movies in general), Yoda. This character brings about not only some of the most humorous bits of the movie, but also some of the most important and challenging ones. It has a bit of a slow start, which is really the only reason I rate it less than the original. I'm not really sure why I prefer the original, but there are few circumstances when I like a sequel almost as much as the first film. The lightsaber battle at the end is probably the most intense one in the entire saga, and if you are unaware of how it turns out, watch it now and find out. This is the only perfect sequel in movie history, in my opinion. A definite favorite of mine.**** out of ****",10,0,1,20 August 2008
Aladdin," Probably one of Disney's best
","What an entirely enjoyable family film. 'Aladdin' is actually pretty close to perfection. The plot is typical for most Disney movies of its type, similar to films such as 'The Little Mermaid' or 'The Lion King.' As usual, of course, what makes these films great is not the plot but all of the little details throw in to make it fun. In 'Aladdin,' it's Robin Williams as the Genie that makes the film so great. He steals every scene he is in, moving quickly from one great joke or imitation to another. The reason I like this film so much is because of these scenes. I don't believe there's another actor besides Williams who could have voiced this role so well. Williams fans young and old alike will be entirely delighted and joyful after seeing his performance. This film also has several great original songs, including the Oscar-winning 'A Whole New World' and 'Never Had a Friend Like Me.' The only real reason the film comes off as less than perfect is because of the last few scenes. I hate snakes, and I think Jafar's transformation into a giant snake toward the end is far too scary for the young audience the film was intended for. If the film hadn't taken this unnecessary step, it could have been perfect in my book. Nevertheless, it is still tons of fun, and one of the funniest and most enjoyable Disney films you will probably ever see.***1/2 out of ****",8,1,2,30 October 2008
Braveheart," Brilliant
","Rarely do I find a film this long that can hold my attention the entire way through. 'Braveheart' is composed of one brilliant scene after another, all due to Mel Gibson's excellent directing, as well as his superb acting. From an early scene in which the little girl hands young William Wallace a flower at the grave site to Wallace pleading to the enemy to apologize to Scotland's people in an almost unreal way, great care and direction was clearly given to every scene in this film. The battle scenes do not drag on too long as in films such as 'Lord of the Rings' but instead are just long enough to keep us engaged. The battle scenes are masterfully balanced with scenes of dialogue and character development, which is important because it helps cause us to care about the characters. The film is brutal and violent by nature, so most likely it is not for everyone. Nevertheless, it's nearly perfect for me. Gibson draws the detail out just long enough to tell his whole story and still keep us engaged long enough to watch it all. A great, brilliant film, worthy of many of the Oscars it received.

","It's hard to know what to say about 'Slumdog Millionaire,' but I will do my best to put my feelings to words. The simplest way I can express my thoughts on this film is to say that I am impressed. First of all, this film has a completely unique concept, something very refreshing to someone like me who has seen quite a few movies. The plot involves a young man who has lived in the slums of India his whole life. When he has a chance to go on India's version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,' he knows the answers to nearly all the questions. He is arrested on the belief that he is cheating, since someone who has lived a life such as his should not know as much as he does. The rest of the film is told in flashbacks as he tells his life story, and how events in his life helped him know all of these answers. It's a fascinating story, especially when told in this manner. Although the plot seems fairly predictable, you'll find yourself watching every scene carefully to catch the details that make it interesting, and you'll soon realize that almost anything you predicted about the plot is wrong. I also liked this film because although it was a drama, the events were never so heavy and depressing that the film was unwatchable. The film is an eye-opener to the conditions of the slums in India, but there are some funny moments as well, such as the young boy pretending to be a tour guide of the Taj Majal, though he clearly knows nothing about it. Perhaps it's not an absolutely perfect film, since the events of the man's life and the questions on the show can be a bit coincidentally. Truthfully, however, I didn't mind. This is a watchable, moving film that entertains and fascinates. Recommended, and worthy of Best Picture.***1/2 out of ****",9,1,3,5 April 2009
Gladiator," An epic worthy of Best Picture
","To my surprise, I've read several negative comments on this film, referring to it both as 'fluff' and a 'Braveheart-wanna-be.' I found 'Gladiator' to be a well-made, engaging epic and character study of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a general who becomes a fugitive and comes back to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge on the ones who killed his family. Maximus is a great character that many people can probably somehow relate to. This is Russell Crowe's best film by a long shot. In the same way that 'Braveheart' taught us that 'Every man dies, not every man really lives,' this film teaches us that 'What we do in life echoes in eternity,' an equally compelling message that resonates both during and long after the movie is over. The film's unique way of depicting the afterlife (which I won't give away here) is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, and the flashbacks between eternity and the battle scenes toward the end are due to Ridley Scott's superb job of directing this film. It's not completely flawless as 'Braveheart' was, since I could have done without a particular murder sequence and a few of the battle scenes which are a bit repetitive. Nevertheless, I give this film a high recommendation. 'Gladiator' will entertain and engage you, giving you a lot to think about when living your life.***1/2 out of ****",9,1,2,20 June 2009
Pocahontas," Way underrated; the film is a masterpiece
","I can't believe how many negative reviews this film has received. In reality, everything about the film is masterfully done. The animation is beautifully drawn and the characters are all full of life. For some reason, people feel that the film is racist, but on the contrary, it teaches that we need not look upon others as inferior or unimportant but that we should all live together and share the land. One of the things that really impressed me about this movie was the music. Although 'Colors of the Wind' won the Oscar, 'If I Never Knew You' is even better, in my opinion. Nevertheless, these are two of the best songs I've ever heard in a Disney movie. The interactions between the characters are perfectly done. Without giving away the ending, the film doesn't end perfectly happy, unlike most Disney films. Not that I don't love happy endings, but this keeps the reality of the story of Pocahontas more accurate, and Disney should be applauded for that. Maybe not everything is perfect about the movie, but it satisfied me and proved to be enjoyable and filled with emotion. If you've put off seeing this film, don't deprive yourself any longer. It's worth your time.***1/2 out of ****",8,7,10,9 August 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The best Indiana Jones movie
","What a great film. This is one of the few times the third film in a series turned out to be the best. Most people probably consider 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' to be more of a classic than this film, but 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' proved to be the most enjoyable, in my opinion. This film has just as much potential of being a classic as the original. Consider the famous shot of Indy's hat being placed on his head for the first time. The flashback shots to Indiana Jones as a kid are masterfully done. Sean Connery, as Indiana Jones' dad, is a perfect addition to the film and, as usual, manages to steal every scene he is in (my favorite being 'I should've mailed it to the Marx Brothers.'). Following Indy through the path to the Holy Grail toward the end of the film is likely the best scene, with excellent camera-work and unpredictable scenarios he finds himself in. The scene in which Indy and his father must move from a blimp to a plane to a car in just minutes is a perfect example of how much fun this film can be to watch. Some of the fighting scenes can drag on a little, however, which tends to be a problem with all of the Indiana Jones movies. Nevetheless, this one is still the best and leaves me with very little room to complain.***1/2 out of ****",9,0,1,26 August 2008
Beetlejuice," I couldn't help laughing!
","To say I couldn't help laughing is not to say that the film was so stupid it was funny. I mean that 'Beetlejuice' was so funny that I couldn't help laughing at it, and that's not something I say all of the time. It starts off with a couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) crashing their car and getting back to their house and discovering they are dead and are now ghosts. What's worse, a new (and somewhat crazy) family is moving into their home, and they are so disgusted with the new owners that they decide to haunt the house and scare them off. The film gets extremely funny from there, as they are torn between scaring them off themselves or hiring a Bio-exorcist (Beetlejuice, Michael Keaton). It's hard to know what else to say, because there are so many funny parts to describe. For me, perhaps the funniest scene was watching the ghosts scare off the family by controlling their bodies into singing 'The Banana Boat Song' around the table while guests are present at dinner. The film is silly and over-the-top at times, but it has become one of my favorite comedies from the last 20 years. It's much funnier than I expected any film of its type to be, and is probably my favorite of the horror-comedy genre. It may not be for everyone, but if you want to laugh, I suggest you check it out.***1/2 out of ****",8,1,3,17 April 2009
All the President's Men," Excellent depiction of the events
","A true story in itself does not usually make a good film, but it's what the actors and director can do with that story that makes it great. 'All the President's Men' does not tell the story of Watergate but rather the story of the reporters who broke the story. Even the story of a real-life event that managed to cause the U.S. so much stress manages to entertain in this film. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are well cast as Woodward and Bernstein, the reporters. Redford's best scene is probably the one with him scribbling on his notes while on the phone, and Hoffman's is probably him sneaking into an office after getting the secretary out of the room. In his Oscar-winning role, Jason Robards is excellent as the reporters' boss. The film tends to slow down a little about halfway through, though the dialogue remains somewhat interesting. I guess the film can be a little biased in the way that it shows the papers blackmailing the leaders. However, it is still an excellent film, close to perfection. Easily the Best Picture of 1976, for me.***1/2 out of ****",9,4,4,22 August 2008
The Wizard of Oz," What else can I say?
","This is one of the few films that just about everyone I've ever known has seen. So much has been said about it before that there's almost nothing left to say. Having said that, what else can I say than that 'The Wizard of Oz,' is perfect? This classic seems to endure from age to age, generation to generation. So what is it about this film that works so well? The plot is ridiculous beyond all reason, but that's not the point. There's something about the film that makes me cry at the end every time. This is the film that teaches us to believe in who we already are, that 'There's no place like home.' There's also themes of the power of friendship, courage, etc. Combined with 'Over the Rainbow,' 'The Yellow Brick Road,' and more of the best original movie songs ever written, everything about this film works. It's humorous ('Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain'), touching, entertaining, and 100% engaging. In my opinion, probably the best film of 1939, maybe even slightly better than 'Gone With the Wind.' If you're one of the handful who hasn't seen this film, you've truly missed out. It's not just a classic; it's an American past time. Absolutely perfect.**** out of ****",10,3,4,30 October 2008
The Godfather," A truly impressive film
","I had to watch the entire trilogy and reflect on the films for a while before I realized what a great film 'The Godfather' is. As I watched all three films, I really got familiar with all of the characters and became more intrigued as the series went on. Looking back, I felt that this first film was the greatest of the trilogy for several reasons. First of all, it has Marlon Brando, who portrays the amazing character Vito Corleone. This is one of the most memorable, imitated, and lovable characters in film history. His character is masterfully balanced as a powerful mafia patriarch and a loving family man. For this he won a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar. I also prefer this film because Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is a hero rather than the villain he later becomes. As Vito Corelone is wounded by an enemy, Michael must take over leading his empire while he is recovering. The interactions between the characters is excellent here, as is the film's dialogue. There is also a great supporting cast, consisting of Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and more. What a well-crafted story. Part II is almost as good, but I think this is slightly better. Close to perfect.***1/2 out of ****",9,3,6,19 August 2008
