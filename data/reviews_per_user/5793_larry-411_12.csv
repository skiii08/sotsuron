Whip It," Drew Barrymore + Ellen Page = a winning team
","I attended the World Premiere of 'Whip It' at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. This is quite an impressive directorial debut for Drew Barrymore (who also stars).Barrymore works with a Shauna Cross script (based on her own novel Derby Girl) and an all-star cast featuring Ellen Page, Marcia Gay Harden, Daniel Stern, Kristen Wiig, Landon Pigg, Jimmy Fallon, Eve, and Juliette Lewis.Page is Bliss Cavendar, whose mother (Harden) sees her daughter in gowns and crowns as she continues the family tradition of winning beauty pageant trophies. But Bliss' chance encounter with a group of roller skating girls plants other ideas in her head. Austin, Texas happens to host a roller derby league, it's not too far away, and Bliss finally sees a way out of her town (and gown). This sets up a family confrontation that is the stuff of classic coming-of-age stories.The film starts out slow then whips into action, its brilliant ensemble cast hitting its stride and functioning like a winning roller derby team (without the bruises). Then just when you think 'Whip It' is headed into sports rom-com clich√© territory, surprising twists keep it original and refreshing. But despite the multitude of talented actors, Page clearly carries the film on her diminutive shoulders and is easily in control of the material.Production values are naturally first rate, with a vivid color palette and in-your-face costumes that are occasionally (and appropriately) over the top. Cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman and editor Dylan Tichenor work perfectly in sync by reflecting both the snail's pace of Bliss' home life vs. the secret one that flies on wheels around the Austin track. Camera-work places the viewer directly into the action. Despite having been filmed primarily in Michigan (due to favorable tax credits) the Austin scenes are prominent, placing its landmarks in a warm, affectionate light. One benefit of a big budget is the ability to purchase music rights, and the result is a killer soundtrack that will have the audience singing along. Be sure to stay for the second of the two closing credits songs, the best ever cover of one of the greatest rock 'n roll love songs of all time, The Association's 'Never My Love.' Fox Searchlight scores again with Ellen Page, just like they did in 2007 with 'Juno.' Unlike that (at the time) dark horse, this is no little indie. This is classic Hollywood comedy. 'Whip It' is another crowd pleaser to add to this year's must-see list.",8,62,86,24 September 2009
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Sets a new benchmark for what the coming-of-age genre can accomplish
","'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' redefines the classic American coming-of-age story. Writer/director Steven Chbosky has raised the bar on the traditional adolescent drama, with an emotionally-charged narrative infused with just enough bold strokes of joy and heartbreak to set a new benchmark for what the genre can accomplish.Based on Chbosky's own novel of the same name, the movie is about growing up in a tough and unforgiving world, yes, with its requisite lessons on overcoming obstacles. But it also touches on tragic notions of loss and grief, rarely explored in coming-of-age films with such mastery.Chbosky has said that if viewers take away one message from the film, it's that 'you are not alone.' This seemingly simple thought can't come at a better time, as bullying and its often devastating consequences have dominated headlines in recent months.The book's premise is deceptively straightforward. 15-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman) keeps a diary of letters addressed to someone real or imagined. 'Dear Friend,' each entry begins, as he recalls his tumultuous high school days, celebratory one moment, heartbreaking the next, but always poignant and full of promise. The movie brings Charlie's writing to life, with a charming cadre of schoolmates (and the occasional peripheral adult) taking the stage as Charlie stands in the spotlight. It's an ideal structure for a narrative as free of boundaries as the promising world of the adolescent. Charlie is everyteen, we've all been there, or have we? The Perks of Being a Wallflower wanders down paths seldom seen on screen, into surprisingly shocking territory that challenges audiences to open their hearts.The indie look and feel of the film is undeniable from the start. Single-point lighting is used effectively as a plot device. Charlie's face often appears split down the center, one side brightly lit, the other in soft shadow, mirroring his conflicted soul and sense of confusion, trapped between two worlds. Light falls gently on him when he's serene, more harshly in moments of crisis. The darkness hides the secrets he deftly keeps to himself as the narrative unfolds.Audiences of all ages will be able to relate to the 80s modern rock soundtrack -- evocative songs you undoubtedly know and love, spanning generations from Boomers to today's teens. Sound design is brilliantly orchestrated with action timed perfectly to the music cues. Michael Brook's original score is appropriately minimal. Nothing needs to be underlined here in a story that has no filler or room to breathe. Not a frame is wasted on extended character development or conventional transitions in this visualization of Charlie's nonstop roller-coaster of a diary.Andrew Dunn's stunning cinematography patiently engages the viewer, eschewing the hand-held shaky cam style so prevalent in the genre. His use of slow motion dolly shots brings us, literally, into Charlie's world. The boy's fear and sense of unease is heightened by intense closeups that reveal the bittersweet emptiness in his eyes. There's a lot more going on in that youthful head than he allows those around him to see, but even he isn't aware of it. We are but voyeurs, watching, examining, trying to make sense of Charlie's vulnerability and confusion.Editor Mary Jo Markey's loving hand allows us to embrace the plot's twists and turns without skipping a beat. The pace is calm but deliberate, and it's clear that Dunn, Markey, and the rest of the production team are as devoted to Chbosky's vision as a boy experiencing his first romance. You only have one chance to get it right.Chbosky has unquestionably assembled one of the most talented young ensemble casts in recent memory. As Charlie's love interest Sam, 22-year-old Emma Watson dominates the screen with the maturity and wisdom that only a polished veteran could bring to the role. Nina Dobrev, Julia Garner, and Mae Whitman are the free-spirited girls who surround Charlie and attempt to bring him to life. Their performances shine with an authenticity that is clearly rooted in passion for the material. On the male side, Johnny Simmons portrays football jock Brad, whose enigmatic personality figures prominently in the story in ways which will be left to the viewer. Nicholas Braun and Reece Thompson are standouts in support and much-needed comic relief.As Charlie's would-be best friend Patrick, Ezra Miller is shockingly brilliant as a gay-go-lucky teen who lives life as if every day is his last. His joie de vivre is infectious and vacuums the pain out of anyone who comes near.But 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' primarily rests on the shoulders of Logan Lerman. As Charlie, his ability to play down to 15 (he was 19 at the time) owes itself to a physical transformation he brings to every role -- in this case, widening his eyes and keeping an expressionless face that projects puppy dog innocence. His posture, walk, and pattern of speech all serve to underscore Charlie's youthful vulnerability. However 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is remembered, wherever it stands in the pantheon of coming-of-age pictures, Lerman's authentic characterization of Chbosky's semi-autobiographical protagonist should stand as one of the most iconic adolescent portrayals of our time.Some films are intensely personal, and that's as it should be. Art should move you, and you bring your own life experience to the table when considering it. 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' was so much more than I imagined. I expected to be moved but I had no idea where the film would take me. Whether or not you will be similarly affected is something you'll need to discover for yourself. I think you will.",10,15,23,2 October 2012
Lords of Dogtown," A very pleasant surprise
","Lords Of Dogtown was a surprise. Not a huge one, since I had seen clips and knew a bit about the film and the 'plot.' It's based on a true story, so there are no big mysteries here. So like any film based on a true story, the key is in the storytelling. I always want to be pleasantly surprised. So when I already know what is going to happen, my attitude is 'go ahead, make my day.' In no particular order, these were my pleasant surprises:1) The soundtrack. Or should I say the music. If you are familiar with the music of the 70s, you'll hear one classic after another. It is virtually nonstop -- more like an extended music video than a film with music. There are very few moments in the film when there isn't music playing. And I don't mean a score -- there isn't a traditional one -- there are mostly songs, one great song after another. Of course, if you have ever been to or seen any kind of extreme sports in person or on TV there is always rock blaring underneath. So the sound of the film is the sound of skateboarding itself. I can't imagine them having done it any other way. And the moments without music are so dramatic in the absence of it. It is essentially opposite of how films are usually made. Instead of music punctuating poignant moments, here we have silence punctuating most of the poignant moments. It is very powerful. 2) The look. It is shot more like a documentary, with mostly handhelds and natural lighting. The outdoor scenes all have the look of a home video to some extent. You really get the feeling you are following them around with cameras. And most of the interiors are very softly lit in hues of blue and amber, so even then it doesn't feel like a typical movie. In most films, lighting more than anything dictates the 'movie' look. Just like with the music, this takes the opposite approach. If you appreciate the look of a film and cinematography, you'll really enjoy how this was done.3) The performances. There are 3 main skaters. The one who is considered the 'father' of modern skateboarding is Jay Adams, played by Emile Hirsch. This is so different a role than any he has ever played. He is scary in this. He is wild, crazy, mad, and the rebel of the bunch. I know that he wanted to stay in character throughout the filming and it's easy to see why. It is an incredible transformation and a shocking performance. He is stunning in this, physically as well as in his performance. The next is Stacy Peralta, played by John Robinson. Stacy is the one who wrote the documentary 'Dogtown and Z-Boys,' on which this was based. He wrote and directed the documentary. It was so successful that many wanted to see the 'story' told. So he wrote this film. Since he wrote it, it is told from his perspective to some extent and so his character is the most sympathetic. But that is perfect for Robinson, since the character is very similar to his character in Elephant. He is sweet, good-natured, kind, friendly, affectionate, and pretty. So if you liked his character in Elephant, you will love him here. The 3rd is Tony Alva, played by Victor Rasuk. Like Jay, he is not necessarily a very likable character but it's not hard to imagine what it must be like to go from zero to hero.But the most amazing performance, and the one that steals the movie, is from Heath Ledger as Skip, who runs the surf/skate shop where they meet and first organize as a team. He is essentially the one who guided their careers in the early days, and although I am not a big fan of Ledger and wasn't expecting much, I would even say it is an Oscar-worthy performance. Just blew me away. Breathtaking. Again, it's hard to comment on the 'story' or the 'sets' since they are telling a true story. And they don't spoonfeed you the story -- it is told in bits and pieces and you sort of have to put them together yourself. They chose not to have a narrator, so there is no 'and this is the day we discovered swimming pools.' You just have to figure out the significance of the moments on your own. So if you know nothing about the history of these guys or of modern skateboarding, you may be confused. They don't telegraph much. You find yourself looking back on scenes and saying 'oh, that's what that meant' as opposed to going into a scene saying 'I know what's supposed to happen here.' The filmmakers assume going in that you know the story beforehand. So it might be good to read a bit about it if you aren't familiar with it. This was a very difficult film to make since almost all the action involving the 3 stars is dangerous. They could not use doubles or stuntmen for everything or else they would have had very little to do. So they had to learn to skate. And there are a lot of stunts that they did themselves which would be amazing even if they were stuntmen, and in many cases they are not. These guys could have gotten themselves killed on this film. Watch for Elden Henson (of Butterfly Effect), Rebecca DeMornay as Jay's (Emile's) mother, and Michael Angarano as Sid, another of the Z-Boys. He is adorable and a joy to watch. Watch for him -- he has a big career ahead of him.",10,1,15,30 September 2005
The Rocker," Two movies in one -- liked one, didn't like the other
","'The Rocker' doesn't quite fit the mold of the indies I generally see and review. It's distributed by 20th Century Fox or, more specifically, Fox Atomic -- the new youth-oriented distribution arm created by this Hollywood studio to tap into the MySpace market (literally). In fact, the social networking site holds a prominent place in the film as well as in its marketing -- MySpace and Fox are both owned by Rupert Murdoch. That said, having spent most of my adult life in the music industry, with it still being my first love, any film with rock & roll at its core is of special interest to me.Robert 'Fish' Fishman (Rainn Wilson), drummer for 80s big-hair rock group Vesuvius, is unceremoniously kicked out of the band just as they're about to begin their volcanic rise to fame and immortality. This forces Fish to put his dreams on the shelf. Enter his nephew Matt (Josh Gadd) who, 20 years later, is in need of a drummer for ADD, the band he's formed with classmates Amelia (Emma Stone) and Curtis (Teddy Geiger). And so begins Fish's journey to redeem himself, avenge his wrong, and fulfill his dream.'The Rocker' is schizophrenic. Director Peter Cattaneo ('The Full Monty') made two movies here. One stars Rainn Wilson channeling Jack Black and is a comedy heavy with farce and sight gags. His dialogue is a nonstop jokefest and the audience loved it. The other is an 'Almost Famous'/'That Thing You Do' drama about a high school band's rise to fame, starring Teddy Geiger as their frontman. He hardly has one funny line in the script, nor do several other bandmates and family members. And that was fine by me. That movie was story- and character-driven with poignancy and heart.I loved the ADD story (as in Attention Deficit Disorder, which might describe this movie's script). As a singer-turned-actor, Geiger carried that film on his shoulders with heart and soul. Robert 'Fish' Fishman's (Rainn Wilson) story is a cute skit that felt shoehorned into an otherwise authentic musical biopic. I get the sense that co-writers Maya Forbes ('The Larry Sanders Show') and Wally Wolodarsky ('The Simpsons') submitted two separate scripts and the producers couldn't decide which one to go with, so they flipped 'em like a deck of cards and played the hand that came up.Fortunately, the best thing about 'The Rocker' is, indeed, the music. While the soundtrack does include your standard classic 80s rock and hair band tunes (Kiss, Foreigner) it's the original music which made this movie work for me. Just as one could listen to 'That Thing You Do' over and over and over (which was exactly what writer/director Tom Hanks was aiming for in his film of the same name), the songs by Chad Fischer are good enough that I could have closed my eyes and still enjoyed the movie. Not only that, but the 'star' of the film, Teddy Geiger, (Rainn Wilson aside) is a bonafide singer/songwriter who actually does do all the singing himself. As Wilson pointed out in the Q&A following the screening I attended, having authentic music performed by a real band was a priority, and Fischer's songs along with Geiger's artistry fit the bill.Take out Fischer's original soundtrack and Geiger's performance and what's left is a tolerable 90 minute film that I wouldn't even be writing about right now. As it is, at one hour forty-two minutes, I couldn't wait for the credits to roll so I could go out and buy the soundtrack.",7,2,7,16 July 2008
Black Book," Hold on for an epic thrill ride
","I attended the North American premiere of 'Black Book' at the Toronto International Film Festival. Although my main interest lies in independent film, and I did see many indies as well as foreign films and documentaries in Toronto, I also saw a few of the 'Gala' selections. Of those 'big movies' on my list, the one which impressed me the most was this Dutch production from Paul Verhoeven. Set in Nazi-occupied Holland during World War II, the film centers around a young Jewish woman named Rachel, who changes her name (and hair, and personality, and more) to Ellis and enters an odyssey of determination and sheer luck in an effort to survive what would otherwise be certain death.Make no mistake about it: this is an epic in the true sense of the word. The visuals are stunning. Everything about the production from the sound to the effects to the score says 'big budget.' The story is chock full of more twists and turns than just about any film I've seen in this genre. And just when you think that, perhaps, Verhoeven is beginning to stretch the bounds of credulity, you realize (at the end credits, if not before) that 'Black Book' is based on fact.Most of all, the film's power is due to the magnificent acting of Carice van Houten. Her Rachel/Ellis is a character so unique, so original, that it holds up against the great heroines of contemporary cinema. Combine her marvelous performance with a wonderful story and superb production values and you end up with a thrill ride from start to finish. 'Black Book' left me breathless.",9,276,325,25 September 2006
21," Slick and polished like a blackjack table, and a complete delight
","'21' was the official Opening Night Film of the 2008 SXSW Film Festival. The film is based on the true story of a group of MIT students who use their math skills to 'beat the house' at blackjack in the Las Vegas casinos. Robert Luketic ('Legally Blonde') directed the Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb adaptation of Ben Mezrich's bestselling book 'Bringing Down the House.''21' is pure Hollywood all the way -- slick and polished, like the wardrobes and personalities inhabited by the kids in their transformation to high rollers. The tight ensemble cast includes Kate Bosworth and Jacob Pitts as team players and Laurence Fishburne as a security chief with a massive dilemma on his hands. But the show belongs to Kevin Spacey as professor Mickey Rosa, mastermind behind the escapade, and Jim Sturgess as Ben Campbell, the reluctant recruit who drives the film as it barrels headlong to a breathless climax.The script is clever, funny, and worthy of math geeks everywhere, and the widescreen action is as nonstop as that on the casino floor. Spacey is Spacey at his best -- just the Kevin we know, nothing more, nothing less -- and that's good enough. Sturgess, a Brit playing an American here (quite well, by the way), proves that he is destined for stardom in the States.In the intro to the screening, Luketic explained how Spacey had bought the rights to Mezrich's book, leading to his having to fight to win the actor over and let him direct the film. Memo to Kevin: thank you. And, whatever you do, wait for the end credits. The stunning remix of the Rolling Stones' 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' is almost worth the price of admission.",7,21,43,13 March 2008
The Dark Knight," Action, action, action, and Heath Ledger's Oscar-worthy final performance
","I attended a screening of 'The Dark Knight' last night. Indies are really my preference and, at $150 million+, this Warner Brothers movie is about as Hollywood as it gets. But it's impossible not to discuss this film, especially in the light of the untimely passing of one of our most gifted actors. The Joker was Heath Ledger's final role.Pluses: Action, action, action, and more action. Did I say action? Good Lord. Guns, bombs, explosions, knives, fistfights, various other weapons, car chases, more explosions, more bombs, and more car chases.You know how in most action movies there's one great bomb/explosion scene? Something big is blown up towards the end? Well, in director/co-writer Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' it happens time and time again, all throughout the film. Not only do you not have to wait until the third act to see something huge blown to smithereens but, every time you think, 'ah, that's the big explosion of the movie,' there's another. And another.Best of all, though, are the chases. This movie has some of the best chase scenes I've ever seen. And there's not just one. Cars, trucks, motorcycles, and even helicopters are involved in some fantastic action sequences. Crashes galore. And, just like with the explosions, just when you think you've seen 'the' big chase scene, there's another. And another.The action is relentless.There's even a love story thrown in for the ladies. And not one F-bomb. Not even an S-word. No sex. No skin. The kids will love it. Men, women, teens, all will find something to like here.Minuses: The storyline is a bit confusing. There's Batman/Bruce Wayne, the Joker, the district attorney, police commissioner, mayor, the Hong Kong businessman, the Mafia, and various other public officials and thugs. All play a role in the plot at some point, more or less, and it's hard to tell the players without a scorecard.Someone said to me, 'a comic book story and it's hard to follow?' Well, frankly, yes. I actually wished it was a bit more mindless so that I could focus on the action. I would have preferred to use my brain less in this case, to tell you the truth. But it didn't lessen the film's impact.Christian Bale is a capable Batman. But 'The Dark Knight' is, most of all, a tribute to Heath Ledger. His Joker and intense, maniacal portrait of him is, supposedly, what drove him to his death. As the story goes, he couldn't leave the character at the set. It haunted him day and night. It's not hard to see why. His performance is so chilling that it was hard to see him on screen and not imagine what it must have been like for him when he went home at the end of the day. Ideally, one is not supposed to be taken out of a movie -- the audience should never think about the actor instead of the character. But it was hard not to, knowing that this was the final role of his life, and one which may have contributed to ending it. That made it even more frightening.The curiosity factor will probably get people into the theaters who might not otherwise have gone. But it's just as well. It will be his legacy, or part of it, and must be seen to be believed.Is 'The Dark Knight' the best film of the year? I don't think so. Will it make a gazillion dollars and turn out to be the #1 movie of the year? I wouldn't be surprised. Is it worth seeing? Yes, I'd recommend it to just about anyone. Does Heath Ledger deserve an Oscar? I'd say yes. His performance IS all that the hype has led you to believe it is.",9,3,8,17 July 2008
Sinister," The movie for jaded horror fans who think nothing can scare them
","Directed and scripted by Scott Derrickson ('The Exorcism of Emily Rose,' 2008's 'The Day the Earth Stood Still') from a C. Robert Cargill story, 'Sinister' is an exquisite realization of an original paranormal theme. The movie debuted in this same town's SXSW Film Festival in March.Ethan Hawke is Ellison Oswalt, a true crime author and devoted family man with a what-have-you-done-for-us-lately fan base and editor anxiously awaiting his next blockbuster. Wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and youngsters Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) are tired of constantly moving from town to town as Oswalt is wont to plant temporary roots close to the subjects of his ripped-from-the-headlines novels. As the film opens, the Oswalts are moving into yet another new house, but Ellison swears this is the last time, and selectively informs his family of his intentions.In the process of unpacking, Ellison discovers a box of the previous owner's old home movies in the attic. Thus begins the odyssey into the unknown. Let it be said at the outset that this is not 'just another found footage film.' In reversing the role of viewer and protagonist, to some extent, it's Hawke's character who discovers the reels while we see his story played out on screen. We don't spend two hours watching shaky 8MM footage. They are integral to the narrative but aren't the sum of its parts.In his horror debut, Hawke turns in a striking tour-de-force performance that rivals anything I've seen recently ('Insidious'' Patrick Wilson comes close). Rylance is delightful as the patient but exasperated wife who's barely willing to stand by her man for one more moment. Foley (Abby in 'Win Win') and D'Addario (Josh in 'People Like Us') are frighteningly authentic as the glue that holds this tight-knit family together. Fred Dalton Thompson ('Law & Order's' D.A. Arthur Branch and former U.S. Senator) does a star turn as the stubborn sheriff who will have nothing to do with outsiders tarnishing his town's already-shaky reputation. Welcome comic relief comes from underrated character actor James Ransone ('Ken Park,' 'Inside Man,' HBO's 'The Wire').This is Ethan Hawke's first foray into this genre, a simple consequence of his passion for the material. 'He said he'd never do horror,' paraphrasing the filmmakers in the Q&A following the screening here, but he fell in love with Derrickson's script. The casting of Juliet Rylance as his wife was also done at his suggestion. Their on screen chemistry is undeniable.The technical team doesn't miss a beat. Top-notch visual effects are always key in a film like this, but the common flaw in this genre lies in overdoing it. CGI and post-production trickery can certainly advance the narrative where appropriate but 'Sinister's' old school in-camera effects, done while shooting, enhance the believability of the action.Cinematographer Chris Norr eschews hand-held for stationary tripod shots and Hitchcockian slow pans, with POV tracking shots that allow the audience to sense the protagonist's growing paranoia. The occasional subjective POV angle, where the character looks at the camera, effectively places the viewer into the scene.Lighting in the Oswalt home, where most of the action takes place, is appropriately subdued and rife with interplays of light and shadow. Hawke is often seen in silhouette, masking dark corners hiding secrets, literally. Terrifying night scenes beg the question, 'Why are you going up into the attic?' Christopher Young's original score blends perfectly with needle-drop songs from some of the filmmakers' favorite indie bands. In a typical production, where third party songs will be inserted, the actors work to a temp track -- music that plays in the background until the company can obtain licensing for the tunes they want for the finished product, usually unknown (although often hoped for) during filming, that are then added to the soundtrack in post-production. With 'Sinister,' Derrickson and his team were able to purchase the rights prior to shooting so the cast members performed to a playback of the songs that would actually be used in the final cut. It does make a difference, especially when seasoned professionals like Hawke are 'acting' in sync with the same music the audience hears in those scenes. It creates a symbiotic ambiance that links viewer to actor.As a reviewer, I try to keep expectations out of my thoughts and writing. After all, it's only fair to the filmmakers (and me, and my readers) to judge a movie on its merits. Fortunately, it's not too much of a challenge to be as objective as possible when entering the theater, especially if it's a premiere and no other reviews are out there (and you haven't watched a trailer). But Fantastic Fest is a genre festival, after all, and one would not attend, theoretically, without being a fan of same. So expectations are placed on the film simply by virtue of the fact it's even being shown.That's why I'm happy to report that 'Sinister' was all I hoped it would be. Yes, this is why I attend Fantastic Fest and movies like this make it worth the trip. This is the flick for jaded horror fans who think nothing can scare them. This one does it. 'Sinister' will give you nightmares.",9,291,423,10 October 2012
Looper," Intriguing and enjoyable as long as you don't take it too seriously
","Writer/director Rian Johnson's third feature ('Brick,' 'The Brothers Bloom') is another mashup, of sorts, in a season full of genre hybrids. On the face of it, 'Looper' brands itself as a time travel tale smack dab in the classic science fiction tradition of films like 'The Butterfly Effect' (in which Ashton Kutcher goes back to the past to change the present), 'The Jacket' (in which Adrien Brody goes into the future to change the present), and 'Donnie Darko' (in which Jake Gyllenhaal, well, we're never quite sure where he goes or why, but he looks good doing it). Of course, there's the iconic (and quite dark for its era) 'The Time Machine' and the (much lighter) 'Back to the Future' franchise, both of which send the protagonists forward or backward in time to escape an unexciting and, possibly, dangerous present.'Looper's' premise (laid out in the opening narration) is that time travel has been, or will be, invented at some point in the future. Bad guys can, thus, be sent back in time to be exterminated in the present, thereby eliminating them before they can get to be the bad guys they are to become. 'Loopers' are the assassins in the present (well, 2044) who've been given the lucrative assignment of preemptively eliminating these to-be-bad guys (from 2074, follow?). As it always has been, and always will be, ethics are trumped by dollars. It's a tough job but somebody has to do it. As the movie opens, we see 'Joe' (the always-dependable Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as the somebody in the process of carrying out this mission as future felons pop into view, only to be blown away seconds later in the middle of a cornfield. A Field of Nightmares, as it were. But Bruce Willis appears and, as he is wont to do, throws a major monkey wrench into the production and the story barrels off from there.Rian Johnson's project benefits from a stellar cast, including Emily Blunt, Paul Dano. Noah Segan, Piper Perabo, and Jeff Daniels, all turning in intriguing performances that confound at every turn. Look for little Pierce Gagnon as Cid, a Damien/Omen meets Haley Joel Osment's 'I see dead people' Cole as a sweet but creepy kid who steals every scene he's in, no easy task in this sea of veteran talent.Cinematographer Steve Yedlin (who also shot Johnson's previous features) maintains a consistent style throughout, making the present day settings somewhat indistinguishable from the future, adding to the delightful confusion of the audience. The music is never obtrusive as composer Nathan Johnson's original score serves the narrative without being showy. The pace is on par with the typical thriller, as editor Bob Ducsay ensures that the action flows at a steady rate without extended periods of introspection, as the filmmakers foil every attempt on the viewer's part to calculate the machinations and solve the riddles appearing on screen.Sci-fi morphs into action-adventure and psychological thriller as the viewer attempts to fit the puzzle pieces together. The identity of many of the characters, present and future, is a mystery -- and, as it turns out, that's really the point of it. There's plenty of eye candy, to be sure, but figuring out who's who and what they're really doing occupies most of the brain throughout 'Looper.' Johnson had a choice here. One option was to make the narrative so confounding that, a la 'Inception,' people would be scratching their heads afterward, at the risk of them becoming disgusted at what they view as self-indulgence on the part of the filmmakers. The other option was to push the movie ever so slightly in that direction but, with a bit of humor and well placed tongue-in-cheek, not take itself so seriously as to annoy the audience into writing it off as a lost two hours (and it is long at 118 minutes). 'Looper' walks a fine line between the two but, in the end, is more feast than famine, putting it in the category of films that must be seen again to be appreciated.",7,0,2,17 October 2012
Cloud Atlas," Look up 'epic' in the dictionary and you may see the poster for 'Cloud Atlas' staring back at you
","Based on the David Mitchell novel, 'Cloud Atlas' boasts a triumvirate of writers and directors. German Tom Tykwer and the sibling team of Andy and Lana Wachowski served as screenwriters, producers, and directors. Tykwer, an accomplished composer, also wrote original music for the movie along with Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek.It's incredibly challenging to write about this enigmatic film without giving anything away. While I still won't reveal details of the plot or actions of the characters, 'Cloud Atlas' cannot be reviewed without some discussion regarding what it's about, and that's no easy task.Pigeonholing a film into a specific genre is something I generally frown upon. After all, it's Hollywood that loves catchy terms like romantic comedies, spy thrillers, and murder mysteries. In the indie world within which my sensibilities lie, movies mirror real life -- funny, sad, tragic, poignant, mysterious and puzzling and absurd, often within the same scene. That's the kind of authenticity that can set the heart racing.'Cloud Atlas' unfolds as a historical narrative set in the 1800s. Suddenly it morphs into a 20th century period piece. It's at turns a pensive drama, detective potboiler, action/adventure flick, political thriller, dark comedy, and pure sci-fi. Then it cycles back again. The plot continually interweaves all the above -- six multiple story lines, all set in different eras with different characters. The only thing connecting these apparently disparate narratives is one curious conundrum that stares the viewer in the face, 'What does it all mean?'The cast is an ensemble within an ensemble, with many stars playing multiple roles across various story lines. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry, portraying three to four characters each, are clearly the names which dominate the scoreboard but every actor went well above and beyond for this production. Most play more than one role, even different sexes at times. This is the stuff of awards. But just mentioning what their roles are would reveal more than I already have, or am about to, so it will be left to the astute viewer to discover who's who.The production values on this omnibus cinematic achievement are stellar. That this is an independent film and not a Hollywood movie is incredulous at times. Each of the half dozen narratives has its own lighting scheme to match the era and mood, with a color palette befitting their respective landscapes -- earth tones in the early pre-industrial periods, primary colors in the present-day segments, and grayscale in the future, back to earth tones again in the great beyond.The camera-work is also story-dependent. Small wonder it 'only' took two cinematographers, not six, to shoot this film. Frank Griebe and John Toll are staring Oscar in the face with this superior display of visual genius. Every possible photographic technique is used here, capturing extreme closeups and sweeping landscapes, often in the same shot, yet the work is never self-indulgent art for art's sake.As literate as it is, the script doesn't take itself as seriously as many viewers will. While filled with platitudes and truisms, there's also quite a bit of comic relief at much-needed intervals.Despite the multiple parallel narratives, each piece has its own distinct mood. 'Cloud Atlas' is triumphant in its ability to integrate every inch of the emotional continuum. There are overt tonal changes across the story lines that, on paper, would appear to be an almost insurmountable task. Yet the filmmakers accomplished this by carefully sliding from comedy to dark comedy to drama to historical drama to mysterious present-day curiosity to scientific achievement leading to the wonders of the future and science fiction, cycling back again, never shocking with abrupt awkward transitions that would require some severe mental adjustment on the part of the viewer.This subtle ebb and flow is not unlike the composition of a symphony, literally echoing that being written throughout the course of the movie itself -- the 'Cloud Atlas Sextet' -- which also happens to form the basis of the soundtrack. It's an original piece composed for the film and its creation is the subtext for one of the story lines. Life imitating art imitating life. These movements, to continue with the musical metaphor, are accomplished by editors Frank Griebe and John Toll through long dissolves whenever possible, blending one narrative into another, a useful device that, again, relieves the viewer of having to put together the puzzle pieces ('Where are we now?'). This frees up the mind to contemplate the overall messages being imparted by the action instead of straining to understand the visuals (a la Inception).'Cloud Atlas' is one of those films that you think you get...then you revise your thinking...again, and again, and again. It's about slavery! No, wait...it's about the Holocaust! Or is it both? Aha, it's about prejudice through the ages -- against dark-skinned people by whites, against Jews, homosexuals...that's it, yes. It's about discrimination, bigotry, racism. But wait, no...there are themes of past lives and reincarnation here. The sins of the fathers are visited upon the sons. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. That's it! No, wait...what's going on here? Aha I get it now...it's about love! The next decision we make changes the future. You come to a fork in the road...do you build? Or destroy? Will your next act be of criminality or kindness? This choice can change mankind. Yes, that's the idea. Everything that occurs is the result of individual decisions. The ocean began with one drop. Is that what 'Cloud Atlas' is about? In the end, the answer is...all the above. But it can all be summed up in two simple words: Eternal Recurrence. That's it. (Really, that's it.)Look up 'epic' in the dictionary and you may see the poster for 'Cloud Atlas' staring back at you. Quite possibly you'll also find it under 'M' for 'masterpiece.'",10,105,200,9 October 2012
Moon," Classic sci-fi driven by a Sam Rockwell tour-de-force
","I attended a screening of 'Moon' at the 2009 SXSW Film Festival in the  legendary Paramount Theatre. There wasn't an empty seat in the  1300-capacity palace. Directed by Duncan Jones, 'Moon' stars Sam  Rockwell, one of our generation's most powerful actors.  The notion of a film being unique seems unlikely in 2009. Not here.  While 'Moon' is a modern-day science fiction film set in the future, it  pays homage to recent classics like 'Blade Runner' and 'Alien.' Viewers  will be dazzled -- fans of the genre will nod in approval.  Science has developed a way to mine the rocks of the moon for clean  energy here on earth. Private enterprise, in the form of a corporation, sends astronauts on a three-year work stint to carry out  this ongoing mission. Sam Bell (Rockwell) is the latest to undertake  this task, with the trusted robot GERTY by his side watching over the  base's operations -- think HAL with a heart. Of course, things are not  what they seem, and the viewer is mesmerized as puzzling and surprising  events unfold.  Cinematographer Gary Shaw contributes to the impression of the eerie  stillness of life on the moon with the copious use of still camera and  slow tracking shots, only using hand-held when necessary. Nicolas  Gaster's editing is sure and steady, emphasizing the slow pace of Sam  Bell's multi-year work assignment. Remember those pre-CGI days when  special effects meant miniature land rovers on a bumpy table? It can  still be done -- and be believable. 'Moon' is evocative of the sci-fi  greats whose visuals were done in-camera, i.e., on set as opposed to  being created by computers in post-production. Sam Bell's unearthly  home is comfortable yet aging like the patina of an old cottage.  Nathan Parker's screenplay (Jones wrote the story but handed over  screen writing duties to Parker) makes the most of Sam Rockwell's  considerable talents. This was quite a physically demanding role, as  well, and rarely has the actor been better (watch 'Snow Angels,'  though). He doesn't just carry the film -- 'Moon' is almost a one-man  show and Rockwell conducts a master class.  'Moon' is a classic, down and dirty (literally) science fiction film  with a baffling mystery that challenges the viewer to live in the shoes  of the protagonist. It's hard to imagine a better one than Sam Rockwell  or a more effective, entertaining, and satisfying cinematic experience.",10,486,597,25 March 2009
Up in the Air," George Clooney + Jason Reitman = classic rom-com hit
","I attended the World Premiere of 'Up in the Air' at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Co-written (with Sheldon Turner), directed, and produced by Academy Award-nominee Jason Reitman from a Walter Kim novel, the film features an all-star cast including George Clooney, Jason Bateman, Anna Kendrick, Vera Farmiga, and Melanie Lynskey.Ryan Bingham (Clooney) spends most of his life in hotels, airports, and on planes -- 'up in the air.' When companies need to downsize but don't have the cojones to send in their own people to do it, he's the one they're hiring to do the firing -- hatchet man at-large. It's not a life that lends itself to love -- trees need ground in which to grow. It's a classic rom-com premise that has all the makings of a hit.The film is primarily a vehicle for George Clooney and he's easily up to the task. There's quite a bit of sadness, though, which was unexpected. But a tour de force for Clooney and a clever script make it memorable. Co-star Anna Kendrick is a star to be reckoned with.'Up in the Air' is clearly Reitman's vision and he's assembled a team that executes it perfectly. There are no bells and whistles here -- visuals take a back seat to the performers, and Eric Steelberg's cinematography is observant but not intrusive. Dana E. Glauberman's editing is efficient and economical.This film is so incredibly mass appeal that I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it. The audience was rolling in the aisles. Jason Reitman does it again with a true crowd pleaser.",8,29,60,24 September 2009
