Captain Phillips," Interesting story but slightly boring.
",While I did like this movie I thought it wasn't very consistent. There were moments when I was bored and moments when the story was heightened with suspense. Obviously you can't go changing the boring moments of a true story but maybe they could have condensed the movie down to an hour and a half. The story would have been told without stretching it out for no apparent reason.Aside from the storyline the actors were really good. You expect that from Tom Hanks but the hijackers were the ones who really stole the show for me. They were very realistic and believable. They provided most of the entertainment in this movie and created a lot of drama.This is a movie that everybody should watch once in their life but I still feel that it could have been better.,6,0,0,8 March 2015
Amistad," Even a star-studded cast could not save this film.
","I just could not get into this movie and found it to be quite boring. Maybe there have been too many other slave/oppression movies that had a stronger story and were more visually appealing but it just didn't capture my emotions.It may have been better when it was released but if you decide to watch it now and have not seen it previously I think you will be disappointed. The reason I decided to watch this was because of the incredible cast including Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Djimon Hounsou and Matthew McConaughey. It was surprising that even their talents could not save this movie.I normally enjoy movies like this and respect the cast immensely but unfortunately on this occasion I think it just missed the mark.",2,13,25,23 February 2014
The Babadook," They took it too far just to be shocking.
",This movie is eerily creepy and suspenseful. It progressively gets better as you get through the movie but the beginning was extremely slow and boring.I have also found it hard to move past the following things. 1. The heavy Australian accent was too bogan for my liking. 2. The characters were annoying as hell. I don't know how the mother put up with a kid like him for as long as she did and she's just an all-round bad parent herself. 3. Never bring a dog into it. So not cool.Putting aside the above issues it did manage to create a certain level of terror. It was slightly erratic in parts and became quite sadistic and violent.I can see how some people may enjoy it but it's not my cup of tea.,4,3,9,15 April 2016
The Book Thief," Really quite enjoyable.
",From the very beginning I was intrigued by this movie. They set the scene so eloquently by addressing the world's mortality which only made me more invested in little Liesel Meminger's journey. Her thirst for new literature is not surprising as it would provide a much needed escape from a dismal reality.The whole thing really gives you a clear understanding of how terrible it really must have been to live in such a fascist time. I felt their fear around an uncertain future and respect their need to conform. The thing that really disgusted me though was the ignorance and naivety of some who truly believed in Hitlers regime. They relished in the prospect of war and treated human life like it was worthless.Although this movie was heartbreaking it was told beautifully with an air of sophistication.,7,0,0,8 January 2016
Pacific Rim," High energy with an exciting plot.
",I thought it was actually a pretty cool movie. Robots fighting sea monsters may seem like a stupid concept but if you keep an open mind and use your imagination then you might just enjoy it too. I wouldn't personally classify it as a blockbuster as it needs more than just a big budget to grant that title but it's a good sci-fi action movie.The character development seems a little weak though. And some of the characters are just plain annoying. Also what's the point of the two pilots. It seems like an odd plot point. But that's probably my biggest issue with the movie.Don't go in with high expectations and you won't be disappointed.,7,0,1,21 February 2016
Forrest Gump," A true classic film.
","This movie will always be a classic. It really tugs at your heartstrings and makes you care about Forrest. There's moments when you feel sorry for him but every negative Forrest turns it into a positive. Sometimes life maybe easier with a simpler existence and an always look on the bright side attitude. Sometimes you envy Forrest and the fact that he is happy with every success he obtains. There will always be haters who can't move on from their abysmal lives but there are always plenty of good souls out there to maintain the balance.This is definitely a must-watch movie that ages very well. It never feels like I'm watching a good old dated film, it feels like I'm watching a completely relevant movie. I cannot recommend it enough.",9,1,2,15 February 2014
American Hustle," A long drawn-out movie about nothing.
","The story was so slow to develop and basically went nowhere. It took so long for me to sorta start enjoying it but I never really did discover the point to it. I don't even know why people were praising this film. To put it bluntly, it was quite rubbish.The cast were excellent though. Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence were particularly impressive in their roles and transformed well. Christian Bale was pretty good too but the women really were the stars of this movie.It really is an overrated film and I would recommend giving it a miss. It's certainly not for everyone.",4,3,4,13 February 2016
Rush," Incredibly entertaining.
",I am so impressed with this movie. The trailer doesn't do it justice and I initially thought it would be a mediocre movie at best. I wasn't expecting the story to be so much deeper than two arrogant men just racing formula one cars. Their story was actually very captivating and they both have the spirit to make them unforgettable.It truly is a terrible experience but honestly I'm sure it happens all the time. And to keep putting yourself into harms way is either a very brave thing to do or incredibly stupid. Another surprise to me was Chris Hemsworth's acting. I knew he wasn't a bad actor but I didn't know he was a good actor. The cast are well suited to their roles and they really immerse themselves in their characters.Overall it was a great movie with a really good story.,7,0,0,28 January 2016
Oblivion," A good Sci-Fi action movie.
","This is probably the only type of movie that Tom Cruise is good in. I quite enjoy action movies that are set in another time with cool gadgets and end of the world themes. This one is no exception. It is a good movie, not great, but it is interesting and entertaining enough.The movie continually keeps you guessing as to what will happen but there are a few dull moments that creep in every now and then. Although I do find myself asking the question of why did they only have two people looking after such an important task? It is one inconsistency that seems odd to me. Of course if this wasn't so then there would be no movie.Overall this is a movie that is definitely worth seeing if you like Sci-Fi action films but don't expect anything too over the top action based or overly intelligent. It is a nice compromise between the two.",7,0,1,2 March 2014
Man of Steel," Better than the critics gave it credit for.
","Wow, the special effects in this movie are phenomenal. You can certainly tell they put a lot of money into it. It really paid off as it makes for a great action movie. Don't listen to the critics as Man of Steel is about entertainment and it does exactly that. Although the overall tone of the film is much darker than previous versions which is a little depressing and Amy Adams was quite possibly the worst choice for Lois Lane but other than that it is a great movie.I feel like this version of Superman has never been told before. It doesn't feel stale and 'done before' but instead offers a new take on a very familiar subject. It's no shiny saviour story, it shows how toxic fear and prejudice really can be. It probably didn't need to be quite so long to send that message but it fills the time adequately nevertheless.So watch and enjoy it for what it is, the cast is more than enough reason.",7,4,7,14 November 2014
Cast Away," Much better than I originally thought.
",I never really enjoyed this movie when it first came out but after watching it again over 10 years later I have found a new appreciation for it. I think initially I was too young to appreciate a film that consists of one man and a desert island for an entire 2 hrs. After I overcame this initial view I discovered that Cast Away is actually a really good movie. Tom Hanks truly is one of the best actors out there. He has the ability to catch your attention and keep you entertained with limited assistance.There still are the major cringe factors in the movie and also the scenes of heartbreak. And I never will love the ending but it really is a great movie that was very well done.,7,0,0,15 February 2014
We're the Millers," Incredibly funny.
","OK seriously, nobody would ever believe that Jennifer Aniston is a stripper. She is the most generic person ever and doesn't have a natural bad-ass bone in her body. Thankfully for most of the movie she plays a Susie bakes a lot homemaker which suits her to a tee. Aside from her the casting is perfect and makes the movie. Will Poulter is especially fantastic as Kenny the naive virgin son. He steals the scene regularly and adds some necessary morality.I was incredibly impressed with how funny the movie really is. From the trailer it looks like it might be a little lame but surprisingly it's laugh out loud funny with a hint of perversion. There are definitely some grossly disgusting to watch moments but they are done very well and only add value to the movie. Overall We're the Millers is a great film that delivers many laughs.",8,2,5,17 November 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," A very good thought-provoking movie.
",Although this is a really good movie I feel like now that I have watched it for a second time the rose-coloured glasses have come off. I too watched the movie at the cinemas and got conned into thinking it was a true masterpiece. Turns out that's not true. While the characters are fantastic the plot drags in a fair few places and I found myself thinking that this movie really should not have been 2 hours long.It is incredibly interesting though to have an insight into people suffering from bipolar disorder as it is still misunderstood. As you see people's awkward reactions and lack of understanding it makes you really feel for people with bipolar and other mental disorders.Now this may not have lived up to the hype but it still is a very good movie with a thought- provoking underlying message.,7,0,0,10 February 2014
Ender's Game," Not a well told story.
","This movie was enjoyable, interesting, exciting and dramatic but it was still average. The concept is so dark and is missing vibrancy. I just wish it didn't take itself so seriously because for the most part it's still a kiddy training camp. The enemy may be real but they are so developmentally challenged that they keep fighting themselves.The ending was pretty disappointing and quite anticlimactic for an action film. I shouldn't be surprised as it is probably aimed at the PG-13 crowd but they initially establish it as anything but a family friendly film. Maybe they needed to decide on an audience and then it would have been more successful. Overall it's just confusing.",5,0,2,12 February 2016
The Lego Movie," It was a bit of fun.
","It's a nice movie but I wouldn't say it was awesome. Concept was good but nothing revolutionary and it was a little bit clunky in its execution. I did actually enjoy the Lego format though. It brought back memories of when I was little and I used to love building with Lego...I mean who didn't. I still can't help myself if I have a pile in front of me. All the old references were classic and what made it fun.While the characters were a little one-dimensional they were lovable. I cared about them enough to keep me engaged in the movie, especially Emmet. The cameos and different Lego lands were also cool and turned it into a proper motion picture instead of a TV movie. So not my favourite movie of all time but it was a good movie.",7,1,3,10 January 2016
Now You See Me," Brilliant magic tricks but lacking in plot points
","It has the ability to draw you in and keeps you entertained and engaged for the entire film but it's lacking substance. Once the show's all over you move on with your life and then don't give the movie a second thought. It's a decent movie but there's nothing really more to it than trickery.Each magic trick they perform provides the beginning, middle and end of the movie. A clumsy cat and mouse chase and a stand up for the little man angle has also been thrown in but it could have been better thought out.I would recommend you watch it for the magic and nothing more. The tricks really are very clever.",8,0,1,2 April 2016
Gandhi," Gandhi was a complicated man.
","Gandhi is one of those spiritual figures that everyone knows of but sometimes you get caught up in the idea of something and forget that they are a real person. I confess, I was one of those people. I never really thought any further about Gandhi past those short statements made about him. 'He was a good and kind person, he was selfless and didn't back down from injustice but did so peacefully.' Well the truth is he was just a person. Neither good nor bad but he was complicated. His heart appeared to be in the right place but now I wonder if he was just as stubborn and arrogant as everybody else. The impression he made on others may have been created by right place, right time. There are many people out there who fight injustices but we don't put them up on pedestals, sometimes we can't help but tear them down.It gives you a lot to think about if you have never seen this movie or know very little about Gandhi. The three hours are well utilised and the cast feel very invested in this production. It makes you want to like the movie and respect the content. At the end, I haven't changed my opinion of Gandhi but I feel that I have a better understanding of who he was as a person and the trials he went through. Some people may disagree with some of the things he did but since he was only human you cannot expect him to also be a saint.",7,0,0,12 July 2014
Non-Stop," Totally unrealistic yet pretty good.
",Geez this movie is suspenseful. Who would have thought that a movie set solely on a plane could be so entertaining. It keeps you guessing the whole way as to who dunnit. Honestly the one person who is behaving strangely is Liam Neeson's character. He is a seriously angry man and should not be allowed to have a gun or a badge. The whole time you cannot help but think how unrealistic it all is. Normal people would never get into this situation.Aside from the ridiculousness of the whole concept I'm not sure the ending needed to be so deep and political. I wish it stayed totally action and didn't try to be all deep and intellectual. Luckily that was a very small part of the movie. Overall though pretty good.,6,4,5,21 February 2015
Schindler's List," Good but certainly not one of the greatest movies of all time.
","I am well aware of the hype surrounding this film but up until now I just never had watched it. Now many people will call me crazy when I say this but I just found it to be a good movie but certainly not one of the greatest films of all time.While the film had a sense of heightened emotion my heart did not ache for the victims portrayed. Don't get me wrong it disgusts me what happened and upon seeing other movies on the subject matter and visiting concentration camps personally nothing disgusts me more but I just couldn't relate to the victims in Schindler's List. Maybe it was because there was no individual character to feel for but instead these crimes were being committed against nameless faces.Also some of the scenes came off as slightly comical (whether they mean't to do that or not) but it made it hard to take this movie seriously. Maybe my expectations were too high, especially for a movie made in the early nineties, but if you are going to claim it is one of the greatest movies of all time then it better be able to back up that claim.",7,1,3,25 February 2014
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," A fun edible ride.
","It's such a fun and creative concept, who wouldn't want to see delicious food falling from the sky. Seems nice in theory but I'm sure it would be pretty sticky and smell quite bad.Because it's so imaginative it makes up for the one-dimensional characters. They may not have a lot of personality but they certainly have a lot of heart. It's just one aspect but they don't make the movie for me.It's the animation that makes it a memorable classic family film. It's beautifully colourful and has a nice amount of intricate details. They have really made the effort to create a wonderful world that enchants you.",7,0,2,16 April 2016
Lincoln," A movie that is interestingly not about Lincoln.
","This is a very good movie and I found it extremely interesting as I had limited knowledge on the civil war. But I will say this, it is a movie that you must focus on or you lose track of what is happening. It was a little slow in places and I was confused as to why some characters were introduced when they provided little substance to the story.And yes I must agree that as other reviews have mentioned this is not a movie about Lincoln. Although I do wonder if maybe people have put too much pressure on his legacy as a great leader. Maybe he was just a man who did one exceptional thing in history and was dull in every other aspect of his life. Isn't that all we can expect from a great leader, that they affect change and implement one great thing. The way the system works we are lucky if they accomplish anything during their time in power.All in all I did enjoy this movie and maybe I might watch it one more time to pick up anything I missed. After that though I believe it will fall into the masterpiece that you watch once in your lifetime category.",7,0,2,23 February 2014
Mama," Scared the life out of me!
",I was on edge for the entire movie. The level of fear created by the shadows and darkness was what made this movie scary. And don't get me started on the two little girls. They were incredible and possibly the creepiest children I have seen on film in a long time.I feel like the storyline is fresh and something we haven't seen before. While watching the movie I had no idea what was going to happen and how it would end. To me that is the definition of a good horror/thriller movie. And anyone who says they predicted the ending is a total liar. The last part of the movie I starred at the screen like a stunned mullet and couldn't fathom what I was seeing.A fantastic movie full of suspense but I actually took points away because it scared the life out of me in a disturbed way.,8,1,3,31 January 2014
Jack Reacher," Nothing new but it's pretty good.
","Jack Reacher is your generic action flick in some ways but overall it's pretty good. The backstory is interesting and provides you with enough mystery and intrigue to keep you engaged and the action sequences are all entertaining. Let's be honest, Tom Cruise was made for these roles and he does them very well but occasionally you get a déjà vu feeling. He's not over the hill just yet.My biggest problem with the movie is that there seems to be too many dumb moments to overlook. I'm not sure if that's the books fault or the directors. Either way it stops you from enjoying this movie fully. All in all it's not a bad movie.",6,0,1,21 November 2014
Thor," Throughly enjoyable.
","Thor is a visually brilliant movie but it unfortunately is lacking in substance. The character development of the gods is good but they have overlooked the humans. They feel weak and somewhat unnecessary to the story. While a few of the things are lacking the action sequences are very entertaining. They have put a lot of money into the special effects and it shows.To be honest, Thor is a dick. I'm not sure if it's Chris Hemsworth's portrayal or if that is just the character but he is incredibly unlikeable. As the movie progresses he does gain some humility but underneath you can still see his cockiness. Overall I really did actually like the movie. It was a great superhero action flick that keeps you engaged. Now I can't wait to watch the next one.",6,0,1,8 September 2014
Jersey Boys," Nice movie.
","I'm not sold on this movie. I just found it to be a little lacklustre and a musical it is not. The Four Seasons had some really classic songs and their rise to fame has some interesting points but it seems like every other artist around the same time. Childhood friends create singing group, they struggle to make it, they finally make it, the group suffers from ego problems...and well you know the rest.I never really knew the story behind the Four Seasons but I definitely love their music. But I'm not sure I cared to see it played out in the theatres. Besides no actor can do their music justice. The musical performances were OK but they were missing that spark. It's nice to watch but certainly not a masterpiece. Clint should stick to grittier genres from now on.",6,1,1,8 February 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," Probably should have been a television special not a 2hr, 40min movie.
","I understand why this movie was made and I also understand why many people wanted to love this movie but unfortunately it proves to be a disappointment. Everything up until the moment they actually capture Bin Laden is extremely dull and not really necessary. When you really think about it, it took 10 years to track him down and real life is not always as interesting as the movies. I imagine tracking down Bin Laden would have been boring with time delays, dead ends, misinformation and just generally painful and that's what shows in Zero Dark Thirty.Do civilians really have the right or need to know what goes on when the government does their job to bring down terrorist scum. Maybe not. A television special probably would have been sufficient to inform the world of the circumstances following the take down of Bin Laden not a 2hr, 40min movie. If you can't handle the full movie fast forward to when they infiltrate the compound he was hiding in. You won't miss anything and you will still get the satisfaction of seeing how everything played out.",4,4,8,1 July 2014
12 Years a Slave," A bit of a letdown really.
",I thought this movie had some good qualities but it was just missing something. Sure the aggression and oppression was there but I didn't believe the emotion. The characters all looked too clean and too well cared for. Nothing seemed to be authentic. Unfortunately the cast is speckled with talent but drowning in mediocrity and incorrect casting.Probably the best bit in the whole movie was when the little white punk got his ass whooped. Everything else just seemed to tick by slowly with no real climax.I really wanted to love this movie but am I missing something...? It was okay but it certainly wasn't good enough to be nominated for any awards let alone win. I've seen way better slave movies in the past that got less credit. I feel like this movie gave nothing new and was created to extend the feelings of 'white guilt'. It was a disgusting time and the movie reflects that but it doesn't change the fact that it was a weak movie. Every slave story is despicable but they don't all require a movie.,6,3,5,12 February 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," Plenty of action in a Groundhog Day inspired concept.
",I initially couldn't help but feel that this movie was another Tom Cruise ego project but then thankfully it started to get interesting. I will admit that the concept is a bit of a stretch and the whole groundhog day theme never really appealed to me but they did it in a way that didn't make you feel like you were watching the same thing over and over again.If I had to change one thing it would be to simplify the story. There are too many competing ideas and the movie goes past in a blur of information. At one point I found myself questioning what this movie was really about and the point of it. There is no real backstory as to why or how the aliens invaded which makes it a bit confusing. Aside from that though it's a good action flick.,7,1,2,29 June 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," A movie about disgusting pigs.
",There was not one character in this movie that I didn't despise. They were all absolutely disgusting and if anybody was going to become karma's bitch it would have been them. Their ego's are out of control for no reason. They're basically the equivalent of call centre operators or conmen. Their only skill is lying.I just don't know what to say because for what it was it wasn't a terrible movie but three hours of deplorable human behaviour is far too much. I got sick of seeing the same thing over and over again. It began to lose it's shock value and became uninteresting. After about forty minutes I was just holding out for the end of the movie when they finally get brought down.,6,4,6,8 January 2016
The Conjuring," Chills you to the bone.
",The Conjuring is actually an incredibly scary movie. You first get the old creepy house vibe like in The Amityville Horror and then it really begins to get terrifying. They use suspense and anticipation to set a truly terrifying scene. Sometimes the absence of something scary can be even more fearful and they play up that angle well. The whole ghost there one moment gone the next kept freaking me out.The cast are also fantastic in their respective roles. Especially the children. You can genuinely feel their fear and see the terror in their faces. Each character is so impressive and I honestly can't fault the movie. It's a brilliant horror film and I cannot wait for The Conjuring 2.,9,1,2,16 February 2016
Saving Mr. Banks," From a bitter woman comes a magical tale.
","All I could think was how could a woman who was so disgustingly rude create such a fanciful lovely character. Boo hoo, just because you have a tough childhood that does not mean you get a free pass in life. The way she treated Walt Disney and the Disney family was disgraceful. All she did was write a few books, Walt Disney on the other hand created dreams. So while I may not like the woman who created Mary Poppins I do love the story.The subject matter may not be likable but Saving Mr. Banks is a really good movie. It's beautifully told and acted. Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson were most certainly the perfect choices for their respective roles. Even Colin Farrell does a good job at portraying Mrs Travers pathetic father. So it's a sad story, something I wasn't expecting but nevertheless a really good movie.",8,0,2,24 February 2015
Thor: The Dark World," All action no substance
",I think my one major issue with Thor is that he is so vapid. I'm also not entirely sure that a second movie was required to tell a nonexistent story. If Thor had something to say or even more substance then I could see the benefit in this movie. The whole thing is filled with arrogant one-liners and pointless statements. There are some brilliant action sequences but overall it's lacking in emotion. Even the actors seem a little lacklustre and not fully committed to their roles. It should be better as there is so much talent in this cast but a bad script will always hurt a movie.I know I'm going to cope flack for this but Thor is certainly the worst marvel superhero that has been turned into a movie. He's one-dimensional and barely deserves his hero title. Watch it if you enjoy an action movie with no storyline cause that is exactly what you'll get.,6,1,2,7 January 2015
Lucy," It has an intriguing concept but isn't perfect.
",I personally found this movie to be quite fascinating. It was nothing like I was expecting but it certainly was interesting. It has a heavy philosophical focus and isn't your typical action thriller. It was actually rather odd in places and I couldn't pinpoint the exact genre they had in mind for this film. That didn't really bother me as it seemed to work but the transition could have been smoother.It was quite an emotionless film led by Scarlett Johansson but I did enjoy Morgan Freeman's role...as always. I liked the movie but I can see how others didn't. I'm sure there are many scientific inaccuracies but that's the point. It's a movie you can only imagine in your wildest dreams. The outlandishness of it all may be hard to fathom by some but do we really know what we think we know. I can truly say I don't but it's nice to see the possibilities.,6,3,4,9 February 2016
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Bill & Ted's Ridiculous Adventure
",OK so this was the first time I have ever seen this movie...I know a bit behind the times but I was only one when it was released. Anyway I thought it was awful. I had always enjoyed the little snippets that people used for entertainment value but the whole movie was just too much.There are a lot of reviewers talking about how only a literary genius could come up with this idea. Give me a break the only people who could come up with an idea like this were stoned at a frat party when they thought up this gem.Now I realise I am not the target audience for this movie so I rated it a solid three. If anything the whole thing may not have been great but it still has a few parts that you can't help liking.,3,3,9,8 February 2014
Godzilla," Really enjoyed this movie.
","I personally really enjoyed this movie. I found it incredibly exciting and very suspenseful. There is something truly terrifying about a ginormous creature that can basically do whatever it pleases and has special abilities. I was initially a little confused though as I was under the impression that Godzilla was the spider alien looking thing. I realised this was not so when Godzilla and the MUTO started to battle. But you know, it still worked for me even if I wasn't completely aware of what was going on.Aside from the somewhat hard to follow storyline everything else about this movie was great. It had a great cast and just the right amount of action and special effects. It may not be your traditional blockbuster action flick but it doesn't need to be. A good movie all round.",8,1,1,28 June 2015
Cloud Atlas," Worst part was when I thought I had been watching for hours then I realised I was only 60mins in. Pure torture.
",I'm going to have to agree with the critics on this one. What initially seems like a good movie from the trailer turns into a very convoluted mess. It confused me throughout and I found myself pondering 'what was the point of it'. I don't have any criticisms for the cast but I do blame the concept and execution.Overall it really was quite dull and felt slightly pompous. It was odd watching it and honestly why they thought this movie needed to be almost 3 hours is beyond me. All I can say is just no. No it was not any good. No this should not have been made. No I will never watch it again.,2,1,6,4 March 2014
Click," A thought provoking dark comedy.
","This may not be one of Adam Sandler's best movies but it still has his trademark comedy with a thought provoking message. As I sat there watching it I was reminded that I need to make the most out of my life and that currently the world is so focused on success and has forgotten about the simpler pleasures in life. It was refreshing to watch.The humour was a little darker than usual and some of the script felt like it was taken from Adam Sandler's real life. I could be reading into it too much but I wonder if he was feeling the pressures of work, wife and kids. It was entertaining nonetheless. Overall not too bad. If your looking for a deeper comedy than this is it but if you really want or need a laugh give this one a miss.",5,0,0,22 February 2014
Spectre," A dull pointless movie.
","I was finding it incredibly hard to stay awake through this movie. Even the action scenes were quite lacklustre. I think it had nothing to do with the big budget special effects but more to do with the emotionless performance of Daniel Craig's James Bond. Whenever anything exciting happened he acted like he didn't even care. He may do this every day but I can't believe it would ever get old or boring. In between the action scenes there were intense periods of nothingness. It's not surprising really as there was no real plot. I just cannot watch a mindless film about fighting, explosions and getting laid when there's no passion.Speaking of passion the 'bond girls' were a big disappointment and had no connection with Bond. It was not believable and super awkward. I know when I've just faced a life or death situation that's exactly the point when I can't resist hooking up with some random. It's such an old concept and it might be time for the Bond series to be put to bed.",3,135,263,2 January 2016
The Great Gatsby," Visually spectacular.
","If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be 'beautiful'. I was never really a big fan of the original. It was just a movie you got forced to watch in English class. Baz Luhrmann's adaptation on the other hand drew me in and held my interest for the entire film. The dancing, the music, the costumes... this movie was a performance piece and it shinned.I am aware that the film is quite unrealistic but I would like to think that would be how the billionaires of today would behave. It's about romance, fantasy and dreams. If you had all the money in the world how realistic would your life be. Besides; the cast were so incredible that you forgot about this fact.While I truly enjoyed The Great Gatsby, I still don't really love the original story. But that would be my one and only negative. It's still a fantastic movie and I applaud Baz Luhrmann for creating beautiful films that are timeless.",9,1,2,29 July 2014
Warm Bodies," Pretty good but could have been better.
","WTF! This is one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen and it was actually pretty good. I'm not sure I knew what to expect but it was nice to see the zombie's perspective this time. Who would have thought they had such an internal conflict going on. Aside from the absolutely ludicrous concept you have a movie with a lot of heart not much substance but I guess you can't have everything.I'm glad I watched this movie but I don't think I need to ever again. They put it all out on the screen with no hidden messages that make you want to come back for more unfortunately. Best part was the awesome old school music. So good try, talented cast, nice idea but once was enough.",7,0,0,23 February 2015
The Birds," Classic Hitchcock.
","This is one of the old classic movies that I actually enjoy watching. Everything just seems to work well together. It is one of those things that I cannot pinpoint as to what I like about it. The cast are engaging, the location is eerie, the script is great and it just seems to work.I love the fact that something so simple like a bird can generate an idea for a great suspense thriller. Alfred Hitchcock really was an incredible director. Even if he didn't have the best technology he used what he had to create a movie that might make you think the next time you come into contact with a little birdie. Even more interesting was his personal relationship with Tippi Hedren. Sometimes real life can be more interesting than the movies.",7,2,4,3 February 2014
