Kill Bill: Vol. 2," QT's Brilliant Way of Balancing Violence with Emotion
","Well,well......Vol 1 made such an impression, I was forced to see the 2nd one as soon as I could. Former was great , the latter greater(again not as great as the greatest::::PULP FICTION). Still a wonderful movie xperience where the characters actually come out.In the previous volume Uma's character was much of an action hero.....which turned into a complete woman. First was about fury,anger,revenge.....while the second one about love,depth and motherhood. It was only possible for QT to bring such a remarkable but still enjoyable contrast in the storyline of the two volumes which comprise of the same story. Still some faults may be detected with this one.Firstly Budds personal life description was not essential,secondly Pei Mei part was a bit comical which I think is harmful for a crime-drama-action movie,thirdly Bill's image could have been made a little bit more cunning(although brilliantly portrayed by Caradine). Overall a great movie made with a completely new style of story-telling.It's a must watch.Just can't miss.........9.5/10",Null,0,1,30 April 2004
Munich," violent, deep, touching....extremely moving...Spielberg does it again.
","I know I am running out of adjectives to describe this movie...but I must say I was deeply move by watching it. Firstly, a marvelous performance by Eric Bana (a fresh face instead of the hackneyed big stars). This was exactly what the movie needed for the lead role. Great European locations to give the motion picture a true feel of what was happening; rusty streets, intimidating men with guns, gun shots in the background. All worked out superbly. Most important of all the historical significance. We all know about the German Olympics in 72 and as rightly tagged this is what happened after that. One of the very rare weak points are its a bit long, at times it keeps on lagging. But the ending was brilliant and after watching the whole movie I felt it was worth 3 hours. If you are a movie who wants some fun, this one is not for you. Surely it doesn't bring the chills n thrills which king Kong or Narnia does, but its a class movie-making. And here Spielberg wins over Peter Jackson (there are some who have started comparing them). Overall, a must watch for all who wants to see good movies: 9 stars out of 10.",9,4,8,24 December 2005
