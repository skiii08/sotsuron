Vertigo," Visually stunning, nothing more than that
","Heard a lot about this film. After watching it, I can say the film 'looks good' but isnothing great. Good looks here means in terms of Cinematograpy, use of Colour, subtle changes in black and bright shades, set decoration etc.For all of those who are saying this is a supsence thriller, sorry but it's not. Atleast, in the second half. It can be considered an unusual obsession story. Logic can be overlooked while watching it.Story :- Gavin hires Scottie, an ex detective to spy his wife to know if she is poccesed by a spirit. Now, there are only two possiblities -either she is poccesed or she is pretending to be. That's why I said there's not much of a suspence. Most of the suspence comes through music only. With almost forty minutes of running time left, whole story is revealed .Now Hitchcock is a smart director, he did not try it make look smart by putting another twist but immediately changed the story from there. Now it becomes an obsession story, but story after that is not all that interesting.Overall, the fil did not impress me much.",7,1,2,22 April 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Dull, has not aged well
","I can never understand why this film is very famous. What's there to see in it. From an action film, I expect it to be entertaining at least, this film is exactly opposite of it. It's dull and boring from scene one. Some people get easily impressed by action sequences, I am not among them but to be honest, there were no good action sequences in it. At the name of story, there is not much to see. And that supernatural scene in the end, for some reason, has destroyed the film further. No matter, what kind of cinema you like to see, it's a film that none can enjoy. It's not for action film fans and definitely not for realistic cinema lovers, and not even comedy, it's nothing, totally nothing film.",2,2,8,20 March 2020
Coraline," Great horror film. But wait! It was supposed to be children's film
","As others reviewers are saying , a very grippy entertainer . A finely animated film with stunning visuals , unique concept and excellent editing . Even a Pixar fan can't deny that. But I find Wiby's character a little annoying . Also, the cat was not given much screen time and should have been properly utilized. But even with these little problems , this film is excellent.But then why PG. This is a dark film (I mean a little too dark ) . It has little feel of a horror film . And the biggest of all , there is a scene of a circus where a women (either Mrs spunk or Mrs forcible) is seen almost completely naked(private parts covered with glitter patches) and camera focuses on her breast moving . Otherwise , a great watch but not suitable for children.",7,0,1,17 November 2018
The Great Dictator," Mindless movie lacking seriousness
","Watched too many mindless comedies this decade. Every time I watch a nonsense comedy(that opens to negative reviews) , I wonder why people make these films. Now I think I got the answer.After watching this film , I realised that Charlie Chaplin was the one who started the culture of nonsense films . But what ever he made has been appreciated by the critics. I am sure if it was directed/acted by anyone else , it would have been forgetten by everyone.Sets used at the war scene were poor.So was the character portrayal of both Characters of Charlie Chaplin .Every character he plays has to behave like an idiot, even the cruel general . He think being mentally ill and doing silly things is the only way laughter can be brought into a film. There are so many inane scenes like one in which he plays with the globe. There are funny scenes too (actually many ) but most of the others are stupid. The final speech by the Jewish barber is the only positive thing about the film .Otherwise, it's what we call a mediocre film.",3,0,5,21 June 2018
My Neighbor Totoro," Too much for a kid's film
","This film is not only for kids . Infact , I don't recommend it to anyone below 13 . Most of the cartoons movies have a simple single plot. This one has two major plots and some sub plots too. I think it's a little complex for a children film.There is a scene where a father and his two daughters bath together which not okay for such a film. Maybe it's a culture in Japan but it can be disturbing for foreign viewers. Furthermore, there is a subplot of a love story between two kids. I admit that cartoons(And Animes) are also for adults but still this is a little too much for animation film.This is case with other Miyazaki films .Coming to the story , it starts with tatsuo kusakabe buying an old house . He lives with his daughters satsuki and Mei while his wife is sick and is in a hospital. Satsuki and Mei discovers that the house is haunted . They soon meet forest spirits and befriends them . First 50 minutes are wonderfully entertaining . It's a highly imaginative film. The bizarreness of the storyline keeps us engaged for entire 50 minutes. But after that the story goes downhill . It becomes confusing . The repetitive incidents fails to entertain . It drags for another thirty minutes.It does not have much of a storyline . It's a combination of sub-plots with a high amount of imagination which is best suited for kids . Miyazaki has a wide understanding about children's mind . More than any of us. But as I said earlier , its little too much complex . The idea of mother's death is dark for a children film.",8,0,0,22 July 2018
The Prestige," My review is a spoiler. Well, the whole movie in itself is a spoiler
","Rivalry between two magicians is a new concept explored by Christopher Nolan. It's originality is it's strength. It's weakness is it's predictability. Two and half hours long , but I still found this engaging till end. But the ending didn't go well with me. The ending is not exactly the ending . It gave away all the plot in about 2/3rd of movie. It was already known that Angier uses a double and that Borden must have used one . That double being a twin is not a surprise. And that the machine produces an another double is quite obvious when Angie dropped the hat and Tesla said 'All are yours'. And was it that difficult to tell Olivia that they were twins? Only good twist at the end was Angier being Lord Cadlow. I like the movie only for the first 110 minutes and not for the last 20. Due to Nolan's fine storytelling. The only bad part is when it tries to be intelligent without having that sort of story.",7,1,1,21 June 2018
American Beauty," Great execution of a poor story
","One of the films which are perfect in terms of acting and direction and every other aspect but lacks a good script.No.1 It started as a comedy , turns out to be a family drama and sometimes has glimpses of comedy. The film does not know what it is.No.2 Characters were unrealistic .No.3 The relationship between parents and children is depicted poorly. We sometimes have bitter relationship with our parents but that doesn't mean we hate them. Also the parents are not as big jerks as shown in the film.And a lot more problems. Ricky's character was so pathetic. Why they can't write a normal character for him .And why he dislikes his father? Because he wanted to give his son the best he can? There is no proper reason for Jane to fall for him. And all the characters were pretty hatable. And a lot more...5/10.",5,1,2,7 June 2018
Dangal," Beautiful but biased toward Mahavir Singh Phogat
","In scripting , direction , acting and technical aspects this film is perfect but digging deep into the story , you will find many flaws in the script and the story looks too fake. First thing is Mahavir Singh Phogat's character . The film tries hard to make his character look good. In the scene where Geeta and Babita goes to a friend's marriage and she explains them how their father does right by forcing them to wrestle is completely nonsense. It's a really illogical scene.Now, as a biography it is completely fake. The character of Coach Pramod Kadam was completely fictional . There were seven coaches in National Academy of sports and no one by the name of Pramod Kadam. There was no such villain in Geeta's real life. And it highly unlikely to believe that the coach in such a big institute gives wrong training to his students .But I always thought as a film it is perfect despite not being true. But, I was proven wrong when I read Baradwaj Rangan's review . (Following are his views on the film ) . I came to know this is highly fairy tale like film. She follows father's advice and won, she neglects him and she lost. In just one day , Mahavir learns that his girls are strong and decides to make them wrestlers. This film has a very few shades of dark. The atmosphere was always like she will win at the end and she did.So, for me it scores neither as a biography nor as a fiction.",5,1,2,28 July 2018
Edward Scissorhands," Just another love story, but here the protagonist has scissors for hands
","So we have an inventor creating a human(Edward). But he died before he could complete his hands. After doctor's death, Edward was exciled by humans for being ugly. Plot is taken from Frankelstien novel.Then a girl, Peg finds him and helps him to recover from depression. Edward starts loving her. But there's a boy Jim in her life. Good guy, but as we already have Johnny Depp as hero , he has to turn evil. Didn't I tell you this was a love story. The rest of film is filled by Edwards challanges to live in a human society a little of Edward's past. The ending was horrible and absolutely unnecessary just to make it look dark. We already have too much cliche like this. People with a brain will not like this film.",4,1,2,8 January 2020
Mr. Nobody," The only film I can call Intelligent
","I am so fed so fed up of seeing psuedo intellectual films rated 8+ on Imdb. The fans accounts of Nolan and Aronofsky rate every of their film ,a perfect ten even before watching it. For this, there are two many of such films on Imdb top 250. These people have ruined Imdb. While gems like this, which is masterpiece by all means is rated at an ordinary 7.8.This film is all about exploring posibilities. And it succesfully. It touches so subjects without being preachy, it's almost unbelievable. First one hour may feel a little slow and unmoving, after that it's so enjoyable to watch. It's not about if the ending makes sense or not as the purpose is served before that. There are some questions unanswered, but it actually doesn't matter.There are films like The man from earth made with similar intentions. But unlike that one , Mr. Nobody tells the story visually rather than purely talking.I can't explain the story here, but can only advice to watch it as well.",9,1,1,6 May 2020
Sultan," Grossly overrated
","Sultan is already 20+ and has no previous experience with wrestling. Learns wrestling for a girl and wins wins Olympic medal in 6 months beating all those who are wrestling for ages. Then retires, makes a comeback at over 40, practices for 15 days and wins a belt in mixed martial arts. Couldn't stand on his feet in final, but suddenly becomes stronger and wins the match after seeing his wife in audience. Story is a joke. Complete joke.",5,0,0,8 January 2020
Parasite," Unique doesn't equal great
","I am among those who openly oppose academy's decision to give Gisaengchung(or parasite) the best picture.The thing that other revievers have noticed and liked is that it has many genres at same time. I admit it's true to some extent. It has a few moments of comedy in first half although it would have liked it more if I could understand korean. Horror element is missing, expect for that scene of climbing down stairs. Mystery element seems fake, there was no need for it.It's only the ending which made the critics bow down to the director. Only one dialogue about crossing the line fooled everyone to believe it's a great film. It was not needed at first, then even if it was there, it was not that subtle or believable.There are films which are made on class differences. Parasite is a film attempts but fails miserably at it.",7,0,2,7 May 2020
Lucy," Most unscientific film i have ever seen
","The notion that an average human using 10% of his brain is completely wrong . Also CPH4 do not increase brain capacity , infact its not even related to the brain. OK, let's ignore this, but I still found this film completely illogical .In the scene where CPH4 start showing effect for the first time , how did she gain that physical strength . She was supposed to use her brain more than ever but has nothing to do with power. In an another scene, she removes a bullet from her shoulder without feeling any pain, means if you can you 70% of your brain you will not feel any kind of pain. Seriously? Then, she can see all the mobile waves traveling in the air with naked eyes and can even zoom it. The screen writer thinks you can do anything if you can use 100% of your brain. You will literally become God.Another dumb scene was in which Lucy explains to the scientists that numbers are just creation of our mind and does'nt physically exist. Like all those scientists are dumb and not already knowing that. And how come Lucy has gained so much knowledge. Brain capacity and knowledge are two different things .
This film is far, far away from Logic .",1,1,6,6 November 2018
