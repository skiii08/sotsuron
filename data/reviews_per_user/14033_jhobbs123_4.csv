Miracle," Amazing Movie inspired by an amazing true story
","The 1980 United States Olympic team was selected from a bunch of college players as the Soviet Union were a national team who had been playing together for 15 years. The Soviets were unstoppable and after beating the USA 10-3 at Madison Square Garden, the 1980 Olympics seemed just like another gold medal for the Soviets. Kurt Russel's performance is great as Coach Brooks and it's amazing how the players were selected. Brooks was looking not for a team, he was looking for a family who could work together. The Americans were believed to not even get to the medal round but something caused them to play unbelievably. After beating Czechoslovakia 7-3, Team USA built up some confidence and played in the greatest sporting event in history. The USA/Soviet Union game on February 22, 1980. This turned out to be the greatest moment in sports history and this movie really re-created it well. The actors were great hockey players and having Al Michaels announce the games was very cool.'DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES?' 'YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'",9,0,1,20 December 2008
Se7en," Extremely thrilling movie! Very Entertaining
","'Se7en' may be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The idea is very original and intense. The movie is not boring for a second. You will be entertained the entire time. This movie is definitely not for most people, but if you like violent and thrilling movies, this is a definite see. This movie came out a long time ago, but it is up there as one of the best movies in the past 20 years. Kevin Spacey plays an astounding performance as 'John Doe', the serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as a purpose to murder. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as well play excellent roles in this great movie. This movie is one of my absolute favorites and I could watch it every week and never get tired of it.",10,3,4,28 December 2008
Scream," Classic
","Scream is one of the greatest movies of all time, even though it didn't have much of a plot. I just enjoy all the laughs and chills you could get watching this movie. This movie is highly entertaining and in my opinion will never get old. It's funny to notice that the MPAA rating consists of strong graphic horror violence and gore when the movie itself isn't really that violent. But, for that time I could see it being one of the most violent movies of its time. It's just cool to see how special effects have changed over time and movies now are so violent that they take away the point of the movie. Scream is a perfect movie when you're in the mood to be entertained. No one needs all the blood and guts that come from movies like 'Hostel' and 'Saw', even 'Final Destination 3' was a little too violent. This movie will remain in fame for ever.9/10",10,0,0,26 March 2009
The Ugly Truth," I never thought I could predict a movie all the way through
","This might be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. And I've seen a ton of movies. This is ranks at the bottom next to 'Witless Protection' and 'Watchmen'. I am sad that I've wasted 1 hour and 30 minutes of my life that I will never get back. Anyone thinking of actually making the mistake of watching this movie like I did, please notice that you have been warned about how this movie sucks. I personally would rather go listen to Dragonforce for an hour and a half than watch this movie again. I am feeling generous today so I'm giving this movie a 4/10 because of Kathryn Heigl being hot and the two times I laughed during the movie. But please, anyone reading this, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE!",2,2,4,26 March 2010
