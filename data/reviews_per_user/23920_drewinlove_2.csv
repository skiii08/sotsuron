The Blair Witch Project," I know it's a fake, but still scary.
","Before I saw 'the Blair witch project', all of the mass media said that it was a fiction, more real than a non-fiction. I took it as a commercial thing, only to raise concern. They also recommended to go ad check the 'Blairwitch.com', an official web site of the movie.( Later,I was aware of the fact that without the basic information of the movie, it isn't scary at all.) I took their recommend and saw the movie finally. At first, the trembling of the scenes and unfamiliar actors seemed to me that it was pretending to be a sort of documentaries. But as running of the movie, I found myself trembling with fear just like the actors doing at the scenes. Even the subject of the fear,like Freddy Kruger, appears enough. It just gives you the feelings that you are chased with something, and you can sleep peacefully no more. It's the beauty of the film. It's not that kind of bloody horror movie. Without lots of blood, screaming, and chopped body, the Blair witch project team made it a really scary movie. Except The Blair Witch Project and The Exorcist, no horror movie made it 'horror' only with unidentified thing and people's fear and insanity ever. I know it's a fake, but still scary. Literally SCARY.",10,2,3,12 October 2001
