Blade Runner 2049," Bland runner
","Sadly this sequel is actually a deceitful attempt at rebooting a franchise for dollops of cash money. It doesn't in any satisfying way develop from the original; it is extremely poor as a sequel. Clearly this is actually the first installment of a legacy (money extraction job) trilogy of Blade Runner derived films. It's financial anemia will probably result in it remaining, entirely unjustifiably, as a direct delayed sequel to the original Blade Runner.I found the film to be utterly unconvincing as a return to the Blade Runner universe. Writing decisions regarding establishing a premise for this sequels events are awful...... Unbelievable. Unconvincing. Incredible. Unworthy.Do any of the actions and decisions which underpin this films plot scenario, and which orientate the behavior and opinions and ideas of the characters make any acceptable sense? To me, I can only say resoundingly 'no'.The obvious conclusion being that the utter deficiencies of the story treatment, when considering this film as a sequel to what has gone before, is because the actual writing concern is focused on the films that were intended to follow it.I deplore this kind of writing: if the first installment is bad or commercially unsuccessful then the emerging story strands and threads will never be seen; only an incoherent and unfulfilled singular film remains to testify to the creative intent.Over the course of a protracted and interminable run time this film deports itself upon a dystopian sci fi near future Earth tableaux of colour coordinated grunged physical decay of the lived in human environment and electric neo noir moral degradation of the living human ecosystem. Which, for a while, a short while, is visually and artistically interesting. But not for long enough. Eventually the production and artistic design follows the sound design and musical score into overstaying it's welcome.The best features of this film are twofold Imo:The first is the thematic interests which ARE directly referenced from the original; the memory/identity of individuals and individualism itself; the human-ness question on a world containing aware human inventions; human sexuality when it is fixated on, or by, 'artificial' partners.Indeed these thematic considerations are entirely in keeping with the wealth of literary sci fi that the original Blade Runner drew upon. Obviously the sci fi novella 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' for starters!
This is exemplified by the fact that, for me, the second most interesting character was a 'female' hologram.Secondly, and quite amazingly, the director manages to elicit the first actually good acting performance that I have enjoyed from Harrison Ford in several years (and a few reprisals of his most celebrated roles!) which genuinely surprised me. And thereby he provided the most interesting screen presence of the film for me.Ryan Gosling, however, plays a character so deliberately oblique and reserved that he reminds me throughout of his more effective turn in 'Drive'; in which film he illuminates his characters situation and orientation, whereas here he is unable to overcome the leaden weight slung onto his character by the requirements of a particularly severe version of the voluntary sacrificial martyr role. 'He grows to living and he is confirmed as living by his willingness to self sacrifice for others he cares for'. Fair play. But his willing sacrifice journey starts with him so stultifyingly inhibited, and for so long, that his unresponsive resting face is a useful visual metaphor for the whole stolid film.Of final interest, is that the (clearly never to be made) following film was probably shaping up to be a very heavily female lead film.....in the context of the desire to produce reproductive Androids by the antagonist the possible intended future shape of this franchise can probable be vaguely discerned.I partly enjoyed this film, but I was disappointed by the writing in all its facets and the shallowness of the visual, physical and audio production values when exposed to such a long run time......I give it a highish 4/10 to 5; but I regret deeply many of the creative decisions made and the business decisions that I feel underpinned the artistic direction.",4,3,5,17 December 2019
3:10 to Yuma," 4 out of 10 for Yuma two
","A remarkable remake of the classic and respected original 50's western b-movie of the same name.In this second version the sense of desperation which draws Bale's character into the plot to transport Crowe to Yuma prison is potently posited.The climax allows for a martyrdom which befits the gloom of Bale's character, adding doom to gloom.The rest of the film is a suspension of belief defying action/adventure with lashings of implausible macho detailings of our leading characters.Overall the staging of action sequences is athletically but astonishingly unbelievably delivered.The directing is best when the film is focused on Bale's family interactions and his all round degraded situation. His backstory and exploits, let alone his barmy male bonding is less successfully directed and acted.Action scenes have flat and unorganized direction and lack coherence and dramatic value as a result.The writing is probably the main culprit for this however, not the director.Overall I rate a 4/10 for a film that fails to live up to its name and to its early promise and further to this fails to deliver believability in its macho characters and it's action.",4,0,1,23 February 2020
Gravity," Relativity Disappointing
","What goes up must come down and this film certainly let me down rather uncomfortably after exciting considerable anticipation.Plotwise an incredible piece of utter bunkum that would have graced a b-movie of yore jarred conspicuously with a parred down aesthetic and a lean narrative style.Having two major Hollywood a-list stars leading proceedings prevented any sense of impersonality and 'this could sort of really be happening' suspension of disbelief on my part.Which again proved incompatible with the obviously earnest and resolute direction and tone.Also such obviously incongruous co-orbitals as the NASA Space shuttle (already retired with great fanfare) a live Hubble repair mission (similarly publicly discontinued....its on its own now) with the I.S.S. and the Chinese multi module space station (not yet built as of February 2020) further dented my interest in this 'realistic' film.Realistic, or realism, as a crucial value of this film was fatally undermined for me by all of the above considerations.Almost every conceit of the film was beyond any sustained credit, for example: a mission scientist realistically dealing with the return space craft was an odd point to insist that we accept.The travel between and arrival at each space station was equally comic book-ish.I found one plot conceit to be utterly bewildering however and that was the radio message conversation with a non-English speaker on Earth.... I can not accept that no ground based space agency, certainly not NASA, would have failed to attempt this method of communication with possibly living astronauts of theirs within the situation of events depicted in 'Gravity'.Preposterous is the best categorisation for this very notion.All taken together I was unimpressed by 'Gravity' 'in the round' and as much as I can complement some individual facets, as a whole it is much less than the sum of its parts.Those positives include fair work from the two leading actors.Good production design and impressive practical effects work.A clear, albeit incoherent, inconsistent and self-contradictory, creative vision.Therefore I rate at 4/10 where many features are highly commendable but the film as a whole delivers the highest of bunkum almost ripe from the fruitiest of early twentieth century science fiction literature let alone mid century b-movie madness and this creates a tonal mess of a movie which defies believability and frustrates enjoyment accordingly.",4,1,1,24 February 2020
Star Trek," Star quality
","To be honest, I was somewhat impressed with the viz and vim of this movie. I was impressed by the glee apparent in the portrayals of almost the entire cast. I was impressed by the interestingly odd reimagining of visual and audio cues of the source material. This film had a lot of style and panache which are surely values not to be underestimated in a piece of pop culture entertainment!In other aspects, well......... the film is insanely stupid, unbelievable, inane, insane, idiotic and doesn't merit any further description because nothing complementary can be forthcoming!!But it does have a dazzling smile and a cracking sense of devilment.I'm gonna rate it a surprising 6/10; all for style and absolutely none for substance. But if a film is aiming primarily at building a new reference of updated material distinct from, but developed from, something widely known then maybe a smash 'n grab of all smiles and styles isn't so strange.",6,0,5,14 November 2019
Fury," Fake
","Remarkably unconvincing and un-captivating war film depicting characters and scenarios that defy the suspense of disbelief. Unclear and unengaging set pieces progress for over two hours climaxing into a fully faux film in the final act.As a study in a masculine and macho community it has nothing original in it's ideas or in it's execution as actors struggle to deliver extremely thinly written characters across an episodic and jarring narrative.Possibly intended to work as a tribute to 'soldiers in war' in the general sense and possessing an a-list Hollywood leading man as it's fulcrum, 'Fury' manages to convey dirt and grime quite well but otherwise fails to convince as a cinematic salute to battlefield combatants.Acting throughout is limited by the thoroughly inadequate writing and the direction never overcomes the limitations of both the writing and a questionable production standard.Possibly the editing process was the most extensive stage in the process of making 'Fury'; there certainly seems to be a failure in the focus of the film, I'm tonal and visual consistency that suggests multiple edits and cuts.I rate a 3/10 with the main credit being earned by the fleetingly used female cast members and the military hardware. I would struggle to recommend this except to Brad Pitt fans or war film completists.",3,3,5,13 March 2020
Inglourious Basterds," 4 plays Tarantino
","Tarantino explores his own film making career with a fizzing demonstration of his writing and directing craftwork and zeal. Unbridled joyfullness in the extreme finds it's apogee with an adventure pulp fiction regarding cross and double cross under the Nazi empire in occupied France in World War Two with vengence and rebellion and spies and secret agents, Gestapo and SS, and almost every Nazi celebrity.'Inglorious Basterds' has multiple strands unflatteringly and inconsistently brought together in an orgy of climaxes.Tarantino used to write characters in the 1990's but often in the 21st century he seems to write caracitures and archetypes, when it works it produces screenplays that ooze Tarantino's vision and films fetid with his styles and signifiers. In this film I believe that it doesn't quite work out.In 'Inglorious Basterds' this forceful pulp fiction treatment of characters certainly inhibits nuanced or implicit acting by all except for the actors playing the cinema owning French 'undesirables' who are playing their parts as if in a different film from the rest of the cast. And in many ways they are. Which is the central criticism of the film as a whole.In a worthy effort at irreverent and intemperate iconoclasm and madcap imagination regarding the second world war 'Inglorious Basterds' seems less than the sum of it's considerable parts.At times gorgeous scenes, particularly in the first period, contrast with the vile behaviour of Nazi Germans in uniform and stylish violence and chaotic action scenes are trademark stamped like punctuation through the two and a half hours that the film lasts for.However my sense that this is an incomplete work, because it's own parts are somehow incompatible, despite the best efforts of Tarantino to write and direct them until they do gel, is my abiding impression.I rate a 6/10 overall because there is a good 4 films worth of bombastic and vibrant historical adventure material here and taken in smaller degrees much is to be appreciated but the work as a whole is not a fair comparison to the great work put into it.",6,0,0,8 March 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Best one
","'Rogue One' is the best Disney Star Wars film, which is not a high accolade, and the best Star Wars franchise film since the original trilogy, which is a similarly low threshold sadly.In its own right 'Rogue One' manages to tell a decent tale; plus show respect and sympathy to its originating source material and, as a vehicle for Disney, it manages to establish a reasonable start to Disney Lucasfilm's desire to produce self contained anthology spin off Star Wars films.Built upon a foundation of such films as 'The Dirty Dozen' or 'The Magnificent 7' a random ragtag group of individualists pursue a common purpose for an almost common goal against the backdrop of a powerful military threat 'Rogue One' tells it's story straight and without too much originality. As it is attempting to justify its own newness as a Star Wars anthology film this is probably a reasonable restraint in narrative invention.However there is a more involved level of treatment in the films themes, which focus on generational split, trust, manipulation, opposition of agendas and the experience of youth in an already established world created for them, by their elders, not by them. All these themes are played out via character traits, interactions and discoveries and under the pressure of the sprawl of an oppressive, destructive and hateful Empire pressurising every enmeshed characters realities.As an anthology film 'Rogue One' is positioned as an unofficial prequel to 'A New Hope' which it respects in its iconography whilst expanding on in cannon: the idea that the oppression and extortion that the Galactic Empire functioned by had caused the Death Star itself to have deliberately had a design flaw worked into it as a personal rebellion by its Chief designer.There are certain problems with the narrative delivery of 'Rogue One', the plot development and characters that prevent me from giving a higher rating however.The plot is overactive and loses a lot of its focus with jumping left and right at every opportunity to the next world and set piece action routine.There is an overall loss of direction for the actors and scenes as the film enters it's second half.Too many supporting characters fail to be characterized in their own right but are instead given just one identifying feature/function; this may be due to the declining directing of the film, or the writing: simply put there are too many characters doing similar things to satisfactorily differentiate.The juddering midpoint sequence of the film where the 'Rogue One' team and mission forms up is not so well prefigured and is therefore uneasily established.The level of contrivance needed to get a desperado team (Rogue One.) from within an over cautious rebellion at that juncture takes some accepting.The climactic battle, happening in and around the imperial library has the sense of being designed for a computer game and not a film. It's echoing of infiltration on the Death Star in 'A New Hope' and the confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader in 'Empire' doesn't outweigh that it is utterly unbelievable as a developing story.The space fleet battle around the planetary shield gates in orbit above the library is even more garbled. The entire shakedown of that battle suggests the imperial forces affording every opportunity to the rebels. Again like a computer game opponent.I rate 6/10 for a Star Wars film that I prefer to any other made in the last 35 years. It honours it's sources and builds carefully upon the visuals and themes of the original trilogy. Whilst developing it's own comments about the damage done by tyranny and resistance via it's own characters. Larger problems with the film are balanced by these strong attributes.",6,1,3,31 December 2019
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek into Flash Gordon
","When Star Trek reaches this point, there's only one conclusion: there is no point.At least in the hands of the people responsible for making the creative decisions on this film: there is no point.Stop making these Star Trek films. Stop making remakes!!! I sincerely believe that the lame and lacklustre, awfully constructed follow on 'Beyond' Star Trek film suffered it's box office disappointment, in part, in the dirty air that was this films trailing wake.In terms of technical credits this film sounds unlike Star Trek. In the character dialogue this film sounds unlike Star Trek. In the production design this film looks unlike Star Trek. In the character actions, motivations, reasonings, this film looks unlike Star Trek!So, if you are going to make a remake, at least make it Star Trek!! If you want to tell new stories, take new creative decisions, follow new directions with these films DONT MAKE REMAKES!!!In fact don't:
1) GO 'BACK' IN TIME (to young Kirk and crew) of something that informed fans know with familial familiarity if you want to flex your creative muscle2) DONT MAKE REMAKES and especially not remakes that are terrible due to misunderstanding the film that's being remade.So really, don't make this film; if the intention is to milk Star Trek milk it properly: if the intention is to be creative BE creative.I can not give this film more than a couple of stars out of ten.....even the visual flair that marked the '09 'Star Trek' reboot has diminished; even the panache with which actors interpreted or impersonated the original cast characters in that film has dissipated.The remaining film is an awfully conceived Flash Gordon esque treatment due to its being a badly considered remake of a film, the source of which clearly wasn't understood.",2,2,4,14 November 2019
Knives Out," Who didn't do it
","'Knives Out' performs as a pleasing entertainment without ever creating characters or situations that require any real amount of belief on the part of the viewer. A whimsy of a film that doesn't overstay itself and offers the chance for a few ripe moments of both character and physical comedy.In every respect I found 'Knives Out' to be adequately interesting and amusing without ever exceeding that mark.In my estimation it is a strong 5/10 heading upwards to a 6 but I think that frankly there were no stand out performances, or remarkable direction, writing, technical credits, etc: so a good 5/10 film that I would tentatively recommend to prior fans of murder mysteries of the Agatha Christie variety and to fans of the director; and to those who generally like a sprinkling of mildly quirky material.",5,3,5,6 January 2020
The Hateful Eight," Enjoyable Eighth from Tarantino
","'The Hateful Eight' seems to be a film that reflects it's auteur writer-director perfectly. His animating interests in life and film and the art form of film composition.Storytelling and it's elegant unrealness seems to preoccupy Tarantino here and he has produced a feature where narrative build and release via a seriously plotted script is the point in of itself rather than a means to display the intent of the story.I think that 'The Hateful Eight' almost makes this work for Tarantino but not necessarily for his audience.The cast realise, as far as I am concerned, that they are pawns in the experience of tale telling and give very 'scripted' performances: what's on the page is what ends up on the screen from every actor.The wonderful photography confirms Tarantino as an explorer in his own creation of visual narrative fantasy.There is a long time allowed for the real complex of violence and physical discord to unleash out of the carefully orchestrated plot lines which with hindsight prefigures Tarantino's next film 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'.I prefer this film a great deal over it's successor however and I rate an 8/10 and recommend it to fans of layered narrative form in cinema and to fans of Samuel L Jackson! Other positives include a typical virtuosity of character actors in supporting roles and musical score from the eminent Morricone.",8,0,2,1 March 2020
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Kidding us on
","A nice collection of character scenarios for the two stars to portray their standard screen personas together before climaxing with a well handled and cinematically famous last stand shootout.At no point is it not obvious and perceptible that it is Robert Redford and Paul Newman goofing off of each other and enjoying the opportunities afforded to strut their stuff.I quite enjoy parts of 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' for this reason, however I also find it remarkably unconvincing and unengaging for the very same reason.The film, of course, gains extra credit for it's justly famous climax and a nice goofy and lightly comedic tone permeates almost to the end.If the story was more interesting, or detailed in it's scenarios, and if the characters were more believable I would perhaps enjoy this slightly comedic and persuasive tonality but as it is it sits squarely as a chance to see the two stars in costume and finally going out with a big bang.Overall I consider this to be a great big confidence trick, a hustle, which was directly and explicitly replicated in a subsequent film starring these two together 'The Sting' which benefits from having Robert Shaw for Redford and Newman to play off which makes their characterisations in that film more effective dramatically.I rate a 4/10 and the film is watchable but I wouldn't recommend to general western fans unless you are familiar with either the sub-genre of comedy westerns or with the 60's styling. Also committed fans of the two leads get plenty of time to see them having a lot of japes.",4,1,1,24 March 2020
The Lost City of Z," Zzzzzzzzzzzzz
","Dreadful waste of talent (both in front of and behind the camera) and material and one of the most disappointing films that I have watched compared to my expectations.Perhaps the jungle photography and some of the period costumes come out of this effort with the most credit....but all other departments are lacking.One question that I had was how come this films version of Fawcett was a cartographer and surveyor and therefore deemed appropriate to send on exploratory expeditions into the un-mapped unknown?I really couldn't understand that. So I had to check that out afterwards and the answer explains a great deal about how this film was so badly botched.The factual Fawcett was an officer in the British Army artillery. Which meant that he was required and trained by the army in all the disciplines necessary to lay artillery barrages. Skills and techniques directly transferable to the explorer-surveyor and a direct explanation as to how he would be deemed suitable to participate in surveying expeditions and, from that stage on, a full blown explorer.Instead here in 'The Lost City of Z' there is no link made to a real, tactile, believable military environment for Fawcett. No convincing context for him to exist as we are meant to believe that he does.Clearly, I would posit, this redrawing of the man's military heritage was done so as to enable him to fight, with line infantry, on the front line trenches of the WWI western front. This is the most famous part of that conflict with the general audience and it affords a great chance to place our protagonist in extreme harms way back in his 'normal life', his European homeland.This is low hanging fruit in terms of dramatic art and causes any semblance of believability to depart the picture in the long run when you consider that this film is attempting to portray the literal and meta journeys of the character Fawcett.Had the 'The Lost City of Z' retained a more accurate military background for its protagonist then a far more interesting journey for our hero would have been sustained. The skills that have latterly made him a journey-er have caused him to be added to the battlefield carnage of a European generation.It would also have generated a more interesting angle on covering the combat of this conflict: indeed what is little known by the wider public is the truly astonishing level of expansion of field and siege artillery forces on the western front; with prodigious quantities of resource and manpower dedicated to this military arm by 1918's war end. This would again lead us closer to a telling of the story of the man Fawcett, in his time and place in this film, with all the potential for more resonant and powerfully dramatic situations that a more realised protagonist affords thoughtful dramas.Instead unbelievable, non-contemporaneous ideas and motifs are utilised to illuminate character interactions and 'help' us learn our characters for ourselves. I learnt that I didn't remotely believe that any of these characters had, or could, exist as portrayed here.As a last point to reinforce this, the real Fawcett disappeared on his final expedition accompanied by his son and his sons best friend. Now that sounds so real. So 1920's British. It could easily fit into any fictional tale originating from that very world. So 'muddle through'. So amateurish. So clubish. Essentially it sounds likely true to its time.This film decides to take the easy decision and omits the sons best friend. Because it would convolute and distract from a conventional and convenient father/son narrative.Altogether disappointing considering the level of critical acclaim earned. The film seems to pay homage to other sources, quite obvious film sources, rather than find an illuminatingband involving treatment of the actual source material: Percy Fawcett and his real happenings.The Lost City of Z is not totally without merit but I can only raise a 3/10 score myself; acting is competent but never convinces that these are people being portrayed by actors rather than actors playing characters that could be anyone; direction and editing lack thrust and nuances; music and sound design are unremarkable; creative decisions and writing were disagreeable to me but as I say, photography and costumes were quite easy to appreciate.",3,0,0,17 December 2019
Knowing," 'By the numbers' but not bang average
","'Knowing' sits astride two genres, being in part a disaster film and a mystery-suspense film; it's a combination that does have a certain impact on the mind even if 'Knowing' uses middlingly unoriginal characterizations and largely obvious plot conventions.If you have seen films in the vein of 'The Mothman Prophesies' then you will feel readily orientated for watching 'Knowing'.Oddly unrelated acting performances from the cast, almost as though the actors had been performing seperately only to be composited together in post production, is possibly because of the directing but I suspect that this film has been very heavily edited and re-edited.This would explain the quite jarring genre jumps, certain plot holes, unexplained plot strands and story points that aren't explained....an example being: how does Nicholas Cage's lead character know the death toll prediction of the first disaster if the pattern of uncircled numbers in the number sequence are still a complete mystery to him as we would be lead to believe at that point? I suspect serious editing after shooting is the reason for so many jumps and joins.However the film does mix it's genres with some effect, the final disaster I found interesting in its scope and in its depiction and Cage often brings a liveliness to his role that almost humanises his character here.Therefore I personally rate a fairly complimentary 4/10....I'm not sure why I liked this but I did find something in 'Knowing' that I liked. If only I knew why.....",4,1,2,19 January 2020
Dunkirk," Derrick-ly a comedy
","Nolan has conjured a remarkable comedy film in the style of Monty Python mixed with Dad's Army etc. A homage not so much to 1940's Britain and the Dunkirk evacuation as to British absurd and satirical comedies of the 1950's through 70's.I think that the writing needed improvement as the actual number of times that I laughed was only the once but I did grin and chuckle a few times.Water is wet. Planes fly in the sky. Ships float until they fill with water. Oil is black and slick. Beaches have sand. Bullets hurt people. Little ships have a shallower draft and can float in shallower water than larger heavier ships with greater displacement.Also, Spitfires have extremely large magazines for ammunition. And the glide characteristics of a glider instead of a front heavy pison engined powered aircraft.I do agree with Kenneth Branagh's naval officer characters estimation that it's all 'frustrating'.Although I would add that it is intermittently funny too.'drop his load' was a good evaluation of an imminent aerial attack. Except that it was a straffing run. It was also one of the funnier lines. Very Python. Taking the mock of British reserve and British slang simultaneously.'Dunkirks' sound design and musical score were oddly reminiscent of horror films or possibly the sci fi/horror sub-genre in examples like 'Sunshine' by another British director Danny Boyle.Practical special effects were astonishingly lacking in impact. Literally impact. Apart from small arms fire, nothing heavier like bombs and shells actually impacted in a torturous moment of kinetic energy. They just blew up where and when they were preset to. Very unsporting of the almost incognito German attackers.Editing. I think that there must be a multitude of 'Dunkirks' on the editors floor. So many cuts.I rate a 3/10 because I suspect that Nolan arranged to have as much original material as possible on screen in the films, particularly 'the little ships' of the 'miracle of Dunkirk'.Beyond the overworked editing and a certain amount of mirthful, posh 'I say' accents being proffered sometimes I can't think of any other facet of the film that I would gauge meriting more stars or a recommendation for anyone to watch unless you are a fan of mid twentieth century British parody/satirical/absurdist comedy.",3,0,0,6 March 2020
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Where was the fantastic?
","I found this film to be poorly considered and altogether inadequate in almost every aspect of filmmaking.Acting. Casting. Direction. Writing. (A lot on the writing front.) Production standard. Production design.Premise. Characters. Plot. Narrative.Derivative and imaginatively deficient would be a good summation of the films creative writing.Stolid and slow is how I would describe 'Fantastic Beasts' as a filmed production.Disappointed is how I would describe myself.The writing is a strange derivative of the dynamic from the TV show 'Dr Who' and the world building premise of the 'Men in Black' films.Our protagonist is an out of place loner weirdo with a mission of good; a case bigger on the inside than the outside, accompanied by a companion, some local allies and a novelty creature. Dr Who already does this. Almost every episode.The world building/premise is a reusing of the 'Men in Black' organisation concept....even in its appearance let alone it's story writing function.Characters seem to function in a film time and space that is extremely plastic, flexible and whimsical.....frequently entering stage left when the script requires their presence regardless of whether there is any consistent reality, from what has been shown previously, to justify this.The most interesting character and characterization is of a cgi Ron Pearlman who appears in just one scene. Everyone else is bland and repetitive from innumerable films that we've already seen.The direction is overwhelmed by the special effects requirements whenever dealing with action sequences or larger set pieces and undersold by inadequate writing during more character focused smaller scale scenes.Production design and standards produce the most bland and boring portrayal of historical New York that I've ever seen depicted. The reading room of a public library would have more life to it. Frankly this extends to interior as well as exterior scenes. There is almost never any interest provided by the environment of the films happenings.Overblown cgi special effects complete the sorry tale.I rate 3/10 and I could only recommend this to people who are gluttons for anything Harry Potter esque. For everyone else there are much better things of this ilk to watch.",3,0,0,8 January 2020
It Follows," It's and interesting premise
","It Follows has a high degree of original content in its set up: the originating premise is stark and bold. Imo however that is by far and away the best feature of this horror film.Even this though has the unfortunate defect of inviting speculation as to the immediate metaphorical meaning of the 'sexually transmitted misfortune'.There remains the decided possibility that it's just a good way of making the mechanics of a slasher teen horror film unfold as usual; and we are dealing with a neat and direct take on a writers crafting of cause and effect upon their story and their characters.Another possibility is that it's a direct filmmakers reference to the well known trope of this sub-genre to use youngsters getting frisky as a means of imperilling them at the hands of a monster that has used their 'distracted' state to get into an attack position!!A trope which is often over-analysed by film critics and fans as having moralistic rather than mechanical meanings.At times, particularly in the initial encounters with 'It' a good eerie atmosphere is generated; and this lasts for a fair while into 'It Follows'.Sadly as the plot proceeds most of this good work meanders and becomes formulaic with unremarkable straight forward exploitative shocks and 'nasties'.This left me less and less impressed and less and less sympathetic to the protagonists and to the film as a whole.My final rating is a strong 4/10.....with some recommendations but overall I'm not going to say that I enjoyed 'It Follows' any more than that; by the end I found it to be simply serviceable slasher horror",4,1,1,18 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once is enough
","This film defies expectation and defies conventional enjoyment too. With a very protracted run time and an undue interest in female feet.
The film is fascinated with its characters and their peripheral Hollywood lives. Sadly I thought that the characters as written and delivered required uniformly one note performances by every actor barring Leo DiCaprio who was required to extend the performance of his character at odd junctures of the films development. This style of piecemeal characterisation scenes is probably representative of the writer/directors approach but in this film the characters as written don't reward the actors or the film with any substance to grow a performance by.The plot and premise of 'Once Upon a Time.........' is threatened to overbalance as Tarantino's preference for sideways plots, dialogue and narrative pressure comes up against a really uninteresting overall treatment of the chosen subject matter.This seems to be because the film is not about anybody real at all. The depictions of every person and group, and therefore the play out of every character scene (and there are a lot of those.) are flimsily fanciful conglomerates of Tarantino's own past memories of the transitional period of American screen storytelling in the late 1960's and into the 70's.As there are no real individuals or groups of people within the films narrative that narrative is flabbily expended upon a distended 'interwoven stories' plot vehicle.For example what do we know of Brad Pitts character? Within half an hour? And then by the end of the film?DiCaprio's character? Surely we've guessed everything about either of them very quickly, so they prove highly anaemic avatars for us to watch Tarantino's vista by.Those 'hippies' that keep populating the film and irking various of our characters.....what are they trying to do? Where did they come from? What do they really believe? Answer to all these questions is 'nothing, no, nowt' to all of the above. Above all, can we actually recognise then as the cult? The family? Members of whom will perpetrate the infamous killings.Tate, is she in this movie? No. An episode of her life (watching herself in a movie of hers at a local cinema) that's what's in the movie. Not her. I guess that Tarantino is familiar and fixated by this moment of her life due to it's inherent ability to convey sadness and sympathy for someone senselessly, tragically killed.In summation, if you are a member of the general audience, the entire film rests on the ability of the ensemble of characters and their interwoven lives lived to make sense of the world that Tarantino is marvelling at.These characters are far to dimly perceived and posited to adequately guide us into a film that is a fantasy scape 'otherworld' constructed of Tarantino's inimitable cultural memory and wistfulness; and therefore we, the general audience, are never sufficiently orientated or acculturated within this fantasy Film to extract anything like the dividends that I believe that Tarantino was trying to share with us.And that is the sticking point, because it is that world of Tarantino's mental making, drawn from his knowledge and memories of that transitional time, that is the subject of this film. The film is meditating on the death of an entire time period and it's associated paraphernalia. And in not killing Tate, in not allowing the multiple murders to transpire the film wallows in the glow of keeping alive, in memory, that lost entire world.Therefore the witheringly slim characters, with their lack of satisfying definition, drive, causation, resolution, development and consequence ultimately deny to us a satisfying viewing.This is all the sadder as this film achieves, and squanders, a truly brilliant level of technical and audacious film making by a genuine movie creator and inveterate movie fan in Tarantino.Of all the films that I have watched before, the film that I am drawn to compare this to the most is 'Vampyr' 1932, subtitled, 'The strange adventure of Allan Gray' which is described as 'leading the viewer, as though guided in a trance, through a realm akin to a waking dream, a zone positioned somewhere between reality and the supernatural.'Whereas 'Vampyr' leads to a fantasy other-world scape of shadows, grey, mists and mires, 'Once upon a time.....' leads us into a fantasy 'never world' of glare, acrylic, marvellous hue and coloured tones but the experience of a voyage into a rare symbolic film is just as strong.Sadly the inability of the characters to help us there, to act as our true guides, utterly abrogates this film for us.",4,3,5,11 November 2019
Django Unchained," Unmistakable Tarantino
","'Django Unchained' has a capacity within itself for powerful storytelling and delivering equally strong messages about it's makers beliefs and motivations.I appreciate the strengths of vision, knowledge, and belief that underpin such cinema.This is Tarantino's work and he allows his fellow collaborators to participate in his overwhelming display of film making.His cast take the opportunity to give punchy and neat, almost clipped, performances with Tarantino himself providing a, for me, unwelcome and unsuccessful dose of 'free' acting towards the very end of proceedings.Cool dialogues and choreographed physical violence permit such dialled in machismo to predominate in most actors performances.The run time is extended and probably prevents a higher rating on my part; especially as a second climax scenario is less agreeable than the main narrative and contributes to this bloated overall duration.Great camera work, action scenes, story, production design, score and enthused acting make this film worthy of a very high rating in my opinion however this problem of 'more isn't always better' in regards to runtime and climaxes leaves me settling at 8/10 and a hearty recommendation to other film fans: as long as they have enough time to spare.",8,0,1,1 March 2020
Get Out," Gets halfway
","Get Out gets half a good film unfortunately though I've seen both halves and therefore half points is all that I can score here.Without a doubt there is a lot to admire and I liked several aspects of the film. In particular the audience mystery was held up in parallel with our protagonists: even though I knew that I was watching a horror film my own inability to orientate to the nature and form of the threat was nicely delayed through the opening scenes. I had not read reviews or any contaminating information beforehand so my responses to the films stimulus were well piqued by the film.Also I liked how the double issue of an interracial couple and a mixed social class couple acted to utterly inoculate our protagonist from his normal human ability to sense when things are 'off' or potentially harmful.After all that nice establishment of our characters, their environment and story start points I found that nothing positive lasted for long for me.People got stupider and events got more ridiculous until only lashings of coincidences and plot armour were being presented.Oddly unbalanced comedy entered at about this stage too.By the final act I was bored and unengaged: nothing new was being adventured any longer and plot devices were blatant.The explosion of suspense to scares was a whimper after a very long slow build up.I don't follow why the film needed to jettison it's attachment to character building in order to provide so little shock and awe.I rate a 5/10 for a film that tentatively interested me with its mature attention to character and legitimate scenario making but then completely lost me as it let it's jack in the box off for the second half.",5,2,3,18 December 2019
Patton," Painfully uninformative
","As a biographical film this must represent an unmitigated failure of interpretation and film making execution. With a prodigious runtime and a large budget, respected producers and writers, a very well endowed production scale with a high level of production values, including in the post production work, 'Patton' manages to produce 'Pap'.It is primarily for the films technical credits that I rate the film above a terrible 1-2/10 score. As a work of craft this is watchable but as a work of artistic output it is hindered by utterly bland and uncaptivating writing and stodgy direction, overblown acting, overlarge cast, overlarge set pieces and a complete failure to generate a convincing sense of time and place in almost any situation that it depicts.Karl Malden impressed me in small doses but the rest of the cast seem to be suffering from such a poor level of writing that any actors would be unable to overcome their material here. George C Scott himself, in the leading role as George S Patton, makes a remarkable effort but you can't carry a film if this length and supposed breadth with such pallid and flat material.Considering the man himself and his exploits and considering the historical context within which this film focuses itself onto his story: the western allies campaigns in Europe in the second half of the Second World War then I can honestly say that a well researched book or documentary will provide a far higher standard of exhilaration, excitement, interest and engagement.'Patton' to my mind represents an attempt at film making on a subject matter that the film makers in question were unequipped to justify.I sense that this film is so amazingly uninteresting and uninformative as a piece of artistic output because fundamentally those responsible for it's artistic creation, as opposed to it's technical production, were disinclined to view the subject with anything but dispassionate disinclination.I rate at 3/10 and I recommend to anyone interested in a meaningless powerhouse acting performance that says nothing of the historical personage being depicted and fans of seeing a lot of military uniforms and hardware on screen. I regret that Scott had to work with the script and the production team that he did; I guess that if his characters writing actually had any guts in it then he could of given an all time great account.",3,0,1,24 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The last remake? Hopefully
","The Last Jedi has a lot of problems, mainly, in my opinion, it's single greatest problem is that the man chosen to make this film doesn't understand, or like, or sympathize in any way with the necessary subject matter of his film.This is the second installment of the Disney made sequel trilogy and sadly, as with its predecessor, it is a remake of the corresponding film from the original trilogy. As such it is echoing the themes and tones of the darkest and most militant edition of that trilogy, 'The Empire Strikes Back' which is widely acclaimed as the best Star Wars film now, but which actually received mixed reactions when brand new precisely because of its darker and bleaker material.I do not believe that filmmaker Rain Johnson was capable of properly creating this remake with sincerity due to its necessary complete discontinuity and disconnect with his own ideas and ideals.Therefore this film proceeds to fail terribly.The story points of this episode are radically rearranged from 'Empire' but they are largely intact as features in 'The Last Jedi' within their new narrative locations.Such things as the frontal land attack on a fortified final resistance base.A trip to a capitalist outpost to seek aid only to be betrayed and almost suffer complete calamity.The young Jedi seeks and finds an old reclusive isolationist jedi master for training.In this training the apprentice undertakes a test below ground and sees a threat from the dark side.There is a sunken x-wing fighter.At the end of the film the resistance is on the run with no fixed base and reduced to a motley collection of survivors.The millennium falcon is chased through a ravine and subterranean spaces.Han solo is captured and out of action/Luke Skywalker dies and is out of action at the closing moment.The use of distant force communication between living force sensitive people Luke/Leia and Rey/Ren.Yoda shows some power!And tonally there is no doubting that the retreating and defeated rebels represents a mid saga lull or low point in the fortunes of the goodies. When good is under the pump.However this film contradicts, confuses, convolutes and counters this tone and the themes of its own story at almost every stage.This produces insurmountable, intractable and utterly irredeemable problems of story, narrative and characters all the way through.From the opening to the ending this film beats itself up uncontrollably.Characters get in the way of the story, story gets in the way of characters. Repeatedly and often in multiple ways within the same scene or sequence.In the end The Last Jedi feels like a space soap opera not a fantasy space sci-fi or 'space opera'; no it presents itself like a space soap opera.Incoherence is uncontrollably let lose upon the storytelling. However, not in any way does this produce a zany or dynamic free-form anarchistic film.It makes for incomplete, incompetent characters making inconceivable and inane and insane decisions. Characters that exist as martyrs to their own suffering at the hands of induced misfortune again and again and again. Until such time as every protagonist and antagonist across the film is jellyfied to a wobbly incoherent mush.Plot holes are another bane of this film: multiple plot holes and inordinate examples of plot conceits and plot armour.The most serious are regarding the climax however, as many people have listed the multitude of unbelievable plot cheats and plot holes through the course of the film already. At the climax however we have the appearance of Luke Skywalker, as a force projection, which buys time for a last ditch escape by the remaining fighters trapped within the base. However as portrayed in the film Luke's intervention in this manner causes his death and only serves to gain relatively fractions of time. There is an example effected however but only due to the offchance noticing of a form of local wildlife doing a runner. Erm. What? No. No. Was that part of Luke's plan? That someone inside the base would see a native animal in those few moments, see the animals appearing to flee, make a rather unfounded conclusion that they were fleeing cus they 'knew' what they were doing and rally everyone to follow. So....if those animals had already fled. Or been killed. Or lived in a different cave that particular day. Or if that single rebel hadn't seen them. Or hadn't drawn a highly contentious conclusion about their actions then Luke's intervention would have been simplely completely unhelpful. Pitifully meaningless. And pathetically useless. That's a serious plot hole right there. Right at the climax.And representative of the entire scope and condition of this film which I have had to rate as my first ever 1/10 as it ended my interest in this incarnation of Star Wars.",1,9,13,21 December 2019
Jurassic World," Dinosaur Disaster
","The best way to watch any Jurassic Park film in my opinion is not as a sci-fi, or fantasy or adventure film but as a disaster movie: like in any disaster movie we know what the source of the catastrophe will be and the entertainment is therefore twofold; firstly how exactly will things go from 'nought to sixty' and what exact mayhem will be unleashed!!'Jurassic World' services both these requirements perfectly well and produces an overall satisfactory disaster movie for its troubles.Adequately acted by the child actors and passably so by a mainly unchallenged adult cast the direction and editing keep the pace cranking along after first taking time establishing who's faces we are going to see contorting in fear later and in tipping us the wink as to all the possible domino effects that might unleash the impending doom!I found the references to the 'first island', and by extension the original film, to be an entirely worthwhile angle for this 'soft rebooting'/belated 3rd sequel to use.The special effects and the depictions of carnage and chaos as dinosaurs fought and killed and ate people and fought and killed and ate each other were excitingly sillified.Sillified madhouse nonsense sums up a decent disaster movie experience.I rate a 6/10 and recommend accordingly if the viewer treats this movie within its appropriate genre; but as an aside the sequel sounds terrible, not a good disaster movie concept at all, and I haven't considered watching it as a result.",6,0,0,24 February 2020
Logan," Morbid
","A definitive send off for Wolverine, and a well made piece of work, with good acting and a very heavy going quota of emotional baggage. Almost enough baggage to sink a ship that has a pretty slight and simple story, few important characters and a heavy handed approach to the characters emotional conditions.Also the film has a decidedly underwhelming villain and a less than imposing goon plus a gimmicky mirror baddie Wolverine.Direction and choreography are adequate for the task at hand and there is a well designed audio effects. The musical score follows the emotional morbidity of the films tone and never fails to reinforce the many opportunities for heart string plucking.The main gain for 'Logan' is from it's actors who mainly give excellent performances, particularly Patrick Stewart and young Dafne Keen; Hugh Jackman meanwhile has no problem portraying his character in absolute any condition required.'Logan's reverence for old westerns, and particular references to 'Shane' have the unfortunate effect of giving characters most of their most poignant and illuminated dialogues, which humanise them the most, as quotes from that other film. This degree of transference is a trying side effect of being so heavily indebted to another film whilst your own has issues of minimally written story, situations and characters.I rate an even-stevens 5/10 for a strong valedictory send off for the Wolverine character and some very good acting performances. In the technical credits the film is sufficiently proficient to get through various fracas. An overloading of the films protagonists with grief and calamity beyond that which some actors have the time to humanise adequately with their portrayals and a sadly unsubstantial breed of villainy means that I can't rate higher.",5,1,3,29 March 2020
The Last Samurai," Tom Cruise is Samurai.
","'The Last Samurai' is a film that does a lot right but so much wrong. Eventually succumbing to the twin perils of becoming a Tom Cruise centrefold vehicle and a painfully over earnest tragedy.Excellent photography and locations throughout the film are matched by lovely sets and costumes. The musical score fits the film better as it goes on and there are two or three very engagingly staged action scenes with lots of well edited cuts, sound effects, practical special effects, extras all generating choreographed mayhem.It is clear to me that 'The Last Samurai' was designed as a very soapy and emotional epic historical tragedy complete with a tone of great deeds and greater losses from the receding past. In effect a soft or sallow hero movie rather than a bombastic or assertive one.In doing this there are large heroic themes played on with this film; themes such as outsiders and outcasts not belonging in their time and place, old vs new, loyalty and humility vs selfishness and dishonesty, damage and redemption, and of course change and the passing of things.These are most obviouse in the person of Tom Cruise's protagonist and in the interactions between different factions of Japanese society and through the captivity middle section of the film where Cruise's character is the hostage of the rebels.All taken together 'The Last Samurai' has so much loaded into it and it becomes mawkish and morose in equal measure as earnest soap and flannel come to a cloying emotional payoff; or series of payoffs. All via the incredibly versatile, indestructible and irresistible Tom Cruise protagonist.So much soap and flannel, so much Tom Cruise, that by the end 'The Last Samurai' has vacated any meritorious territory and is on full orgasmic emotional romanticism.I rate 4/10 because there is a lot of good pumped into this monster but it accumulates into an astonishingly overwrought and overstated mess.",4,1,5,25 March 2020
The Witch," Weird Witch
","'The Witch' has a remarkable ability to sustain weird atmosphere and environment, and magical thinking almost throughout its runtime.A crafted and deliberate film which reflects on themes and tonal attributes clearly important to its filmmaker: writer-director Eggers; this directness of vision benefits 'The Witch' greatly.Technical credits and production standards are of a commendably high and effective standard.The period portrayal, whilst necessarily dramatically formulated, is immensely interesting: the language and accents, including the 'vocabulary of ideas' of the protagonists is a particular high point in this historical horror.On the flip side most of the best moments of the film are clustered towards the first half with a diminution of highlights as the film progresses.The climax is perhaps rather modern in its sensibilities which I found to be really jarring after a film that is constrained to its depicted environment so rigorously by the writing and directing almost all through the prior runtime.Some of the character scenes between family members could have been more energetically staged and frame compositions are sometimes unable to make use of all the potential of the environment.For a considerable contribution to the historical horror/folk horror genres, and from a first time director, 'The Witch' is a strong announcement of a filmmaker with vision and purpose; in itself there is much to commend.I rate 'The Witch' a 7/10 and I would particularly recommend to fans of psychological horror/thrillers, historical films, folk horror and witchcraft/black magic horror.....it is far from perfect but with allowances made for a first time director this is a really good if not quite a very best or great standard film.",7,1,2,8 January 2020
Joker," Dark Comedy
","The film Joker seems to be a black comedy; it's slick, sick and stylish sense of humour drawing on the 'all you can do is laugh at life' vein of thought, or should I say mood...In my opinion, the film does this well!Strongly influenced by many Hollywood classics of the 70's and 80's and rampant with a sense of it's individuality within a plethora of comic book material cinema adaptations.I thought that the lead performance eclipsed any other facet of the film and made for a lead character who could involve my attention all the way.There are lovely moments which perhaps hark to a slightly more recent American film making period, of 'Momentum', 'American Beauty', 'Eternal Sunshine....' and 'Requiem for a Dream' as well as the obvious references to the cinema of New Hollywood.I personally enjoyed the introduction of young kid Bruce Wayne once, at the gates to Wayne mansion, especially in the heightened context of a possible brotherly relationship that was slipping through the film at that juncture. I did not appreciate his reintroduction later in the film and certainly not when I realised that Batmans uber origin story was actually to be visualised AGAIN within this film.I also felt that there was perhaps more line to be played out about the conflict of realities that was represented by the possibility of his mother being right about his parentage and driven mad by the total denial of her truth or if she was indeed mad all along and culporable of negligent abuse....in essence was the Joker mad by this abuse or by inheritance and the one truth his 'mother' had spoken was of his actual parentage and his illegitimate 'Wayne status'. In the film it appeared that this tension was not played as far as it could have been....or was going to be in previous scripts.The musical score was sometimes distracting for me, and overloaded a scene or sequence in the film rather than heightening the effect of images and sound effect.However, I was readily, easily and effectively carried along by 'Joker' as it unfolded it's one-character story and I think that the film is worthy of plenty of praise for it's pursuit of such strong storytelling.The transformation of Jokers dancing routines alone, as he morphs through the stages if his changing existence, tells you how tightly the writing, acting and directing of this one character story focuses it's aim.A 7/10 rating from me for this juicy straight-telling darkly black comedy!",7,1,2,14 November 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Great trailer
","They made a great trailer. Shame about the movie.'Kong skull island' does seem to me at least to be better than the other two currently extant films in the monsterverse: the underdone 'Godzilla' and the overwrought 'Godzilla king of the monsters'.....how its monster conceivably fits with the same cinematic universe as the monsters depicted in those two films is a stark question that the next film in the sequence will be detailed to answer.As a sci-fi/fantasy adventure monster film this has enough cool set piece silly season monster violence to make a fine trailer but the paucity of supporting quality from any facet of the film leaves it threadbare at feature film length. Unless you are attached to a certain era of American Vietnam anti-war films beyond rational sane levels.Definitely don't take any human characters or behaviours or situations or interactions to heart.....which is a shame because that's exactly what those vaunted aforementioned American movies that this film intensively references were trying at.As a King Kong movie (which is probably an unfair, even invalid way of evaluating it in all honesty.) it is superficial and lacking in a full sense of humanity in the representation of Kong even when bringing into the equation the complete skeletal remains of both Kong's parents and a flashback (noble) death scenario.As the second part of the putative monsterverse it kinda opens questions that might give 2020's 'Godzilla vs Kong' a lot of problems......but if the film makers involved in charting this franchise have good answers to these questions.....it might make for a better film than this or either of the Godzilla prep fight films.Overall I rate this a watchable 4/10 and I would rather watch this than either of the Godzilla instalments because I think that this film at least develops a style in it's visual storytelling that gives it a more memorable distinctiveness. That's worth a star more in my ratings than either of Godzilla's efforts!",4,2,5,15 November 2019
Parasite," Detritivores
","Oscars best picture, Cannes winner, lauded and acclaimed, and a good and engaging film from beginning to ending. Good in most respects but mainly it has a catchy hook. An engaging premise. A peculiarity in its treatment of subject and theme.I would not agree that such novelty of idea makes, by itself, for an award winning finished film and certainly in this case I am fairly confident that the film as a whole is much less than the 'vigor' of its animating conceit; it's 'reason to be' (made).Ancient issues of human inequality of life invested with a catchy and up to date arrangement is a neat idea, hardly groundbreakingly original in world cinema, but it's a neat idea.Essentially a pursuit, in dramatic film, of the degree to which 'upstairs-downstairs' conditions the life choices, circumstances and outlooks of people caught on opposite sides, how it warps and differentiates lives lived to ultimately decide whole human lives without their own input.This 'have and have nots' and 'how the other half lives' drama is not new and indeed it has precursors in western and eastern film and broader fiction.The manner of this drama is in two stages: firstly the ingratiating 'invasion' of the rich households retinue by the Kim family; eventually completely usurping the established retainers and then secondly the heightening of the old household staff reappearing and ultimately revolting against their disposition; all transpiring almost entirely under the noses, and beneath the awareness of the 'upstairs' 'haves', the Park family.That's it. That's the best idea. The enervating treatment of an old dramatic theme of rich and poor.It's a good film in its runtime: reasonably written except in certain unbelievable characters and relationships; an insistence on a highly risky full assault on employment opportunities by the Kim family that I baulked at whilst watching; and a missed opportunities to illuminate the 'host' family of 'upstairs': the Parks.The acting was usually reliable although few actors were required to display much range in their performance. A major problem was scenes of drinking, 'drunk' acting was unconvincing.Direction and editing were certain if uninspiring. Technical virtues included a sympathetic use of sound design and a well chosen pallet of colours plus an interesting main location at the Park's house.Certain limitations in writing include the Kim daughters character, who I found utterly unconvincing and unbelievabile as presented: she is intelligent, resourceful, outgoing, manipulate, skilled and also beautiful, young, female and single.....and yet none of this seems remotely relevant to the young woman we meet at the films inception...was she being kept in a freeze dried bag until the day before the narrative opens? How can she exist in her environment without these character details having very pertinently pressed upon her life?
As the film proceeds she serves to help other family characters but otherwise she is a doll in a costume after that.The Kim mother is barely recognizable as a full human character with genuine characteristics and a independent life. Her marriage is seldom testified to, is it good to bad, or bad to good, how do they feel to each other and about each other, what little closenesses do they share unique to them....I dunno.
Compared to the Kim men the two females are badly nourished as characters and conspicuously so in the case of the daughter.The Park's family hints having real human people in it but by the end of the film even the husband, who seems quite human at times, is left uninteresting and unconsidered. The idea that they have a real life with skeletons in cupboards was absent. Only the phrasing of the husband to relate about his main encounters with the Kim's father to his wife, with phrases about 'crossing the line' and 'subway people' seemed to expand their humanity.There are 3 marriages featured in the film plus a teenage relationship and only the third and final couple, of the displaced housekeeper, actually seem to have a 'lived in' married life that feels like it proceeds the story concerning the film.The full attack upon maximum employment by the Kim family seemed to me to be an extremely ungainly insistence for the film to impose on my disbelief but it had to do it to develop it's plot line.Finally, in passages the film hints at metaphorical depths such as its talking about 'light', it's use of rain storms and catastrophic floods, underground dwellings and the rock 'scholars stone'. These metaphors interact with the upper class airy people and the ground dwelling lower class people: but here I would have appreciated some 'second unit' type environmental photography to tie the human story with the metaphorical levels with the films physical reality. I'd have accepted an extension of the runtime to achieve this extra footage on the edit.In summation I rate at a lowish 6/10 and I would reserve my agreement that this film deserves such rewards as it has garnered for what is basically a neat idea for a particular treatment of standard themes and subject matter which is amiably delivered on screen but suffers from varied failures in execution in the writing.",6,3,5,28 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Awkwardly forced
","This film was assuredly critic proof and having seen it that was certainly an advantage that it needed.Why would you make the 'next' Star Wars film like this? After a production hiatus and a change of franchise ownership. The first installment of a sequel trilogy? Episode VII of a nine part saga?It's as though there was no confidence on the part of the film makers and financiers that Star Wars fans would go see it........and take their families and friends.......in some instances repeatedly.They could have written, produced and released anything. Anything that their imaginations could conceive and their film making skills convey.So.Why this? Is this what they wanted to make?A one paced remake. A prolonged slow, plodding, remake apology for touching the Star Wars brand? Why did they turn apologists for their own film making?An entire movie of apologising for casting new actors in new roles in a new era of new stories. OK. We know it's not 1977 or 1999 or any part of the 20th century.But there was no confidence that anything that these filmmakers would produce would be accepted by fans without a two hour apology on the part of the new management.Perhaps because Disney had bought Lucasfilm simply because it was for sale and a desirable property to investing in.Maybe.As I watched this fresh in the cinema I realised that this film was bad because of how boring it was. Within thirty minutes of the opening scroll I was bored and getting increasingly so.I wondered how professional filmmakers could produce a film so one paced. So incapable of telling a story in a manner that human beings naturally respond to, like a rhythm of life, like how almost every competent story teller does it. Modulation I believe is the term. Changes of pace and tone. Changes if emphasis and urgency. Things like that diminish the capacity for boring fiction. This film has a sky high over capacity.Because the one paced storytelling is resolutely slow paced. Like a ship sluggishly responding to the helm at very low speeds. This film has a turning circle that never quits.In part it is slowed down by the plethora of characters. The film sadly has two casts and that is far too many characters for this level of storytelling to carry.You can almost see scenes getting out of the way so that the next character can introduce themselves. Then that scene stands aside so that a previously ponderously introduced new or reintroduced returning character can have a 'doing' scene. Then they, and their scene, step aside for the next introduction. Which repeats the formula once again. For ages this film keeps doing this.Unfortunately I found the acting to be as awkward as the written filmplay must have read. New actors were awkward. Returning actors were awkward. Awkward individually. Awkward in concert. Generational difference doesn't have to produce an effect like this....an effect similar to one you may experience bumping into an old friend that you no longer have anything in common with. Or an ex partner.....Harrison Ford seems as bored as I was watching his performance. I've since seen 'Solo: A Star Wars story' and I still think that this is the single worst performance of the role of Han Solo that I've ever witnessed.Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford's returning characters take the awkwardness analogy of exes too literally. Why and who even wrote that? And with them both being pretty severe victims of 'Hollywood face syndrome' I couldn't decide if they were too bored to emote or just too numbed.I thought that the sound design was poor for a Star Wars film, not least the iconic lightsaber duel sound effect, which was ruined by the debatable decision to give the chief goon Kylo Ten a 'lightbroadsword' which had an unattractive sound effect best put down as a simple 'bad creative decision'.Finally I suppose the believability of the drama was utterly lacking. After all these characters are introduced, given their own scene, moved around the galaxy in twos and threes, there's no build up of credibility in any one of them. No credibility means no involvement. No involvement means no suspension of disbelief. And that means no drama. No thrills. No suspense. No climax. No release.It means boring.This is compounded by the choice of premise for our dangerous motivating driver; the thing prodding our protagonist to protagonise: 'The First Order' and it's 'armed forces'.Hhhmmmmmmmm. Boringly derivative nonsense that degrades the original trilogy not so much by underplaying the extent of the goodies win in that contest but denying the new generation a truly distinctive baddie of their own to best. It isn't the original generation of character heros being short changed........its the new ones who are expecting to carry on the thrilling action adventures in space!!!What a way to start. With a total lack of confidence and conviction. A total disdain for the filmmakers own competency.That's my reasoning to explain why this is so boring that it's just finally, frankly, really bad.",2,15,18,19 December 2019
Godzilla," Muto's are boring
","'Godzilla' is mainly Muto's and their defining feature is boringnes. Even their sex lives. Graphic depictions of reproduction by gigantic, ancient, supernatural, monster, insects. Even that's boring. They can't carry this film. In part because their supposed capacity to be a parasite to Godzilla is oddly bypassed..... That's gotta be the real story angle with this set up surely!? But no. No. It isn't. Possibly designing them to resemble the beast from 20000 fathoms would have injected some non-boringness into them by being a kudus gaining reference for monster movie fans?! But no. No. They didn't.As many people have said this film is structured as a slow burn story, mainly availing the audience of snippets of Godzilla until he is unleashed in the climactic engagement with the Muto's. Snippets eventually have skirmishes added to them until the big kaboom fight.It's nice to know that the monsters in this film have read their fair share of film scripts. So that they know how to behave. Entirely the opposite of the monsters in the director Edwards' breakout film.By contrast the madness and of the Japanese Godzilla is gone. Why make Godzilla films if they're not mad? It's the main crazy enjoyment that I get from them! Sometimes watching Japanese Godzilla films I'm not sure if I have any sense of any sense at all and that's utterly absent in this film. The film makes rigid sense.Also Godzilla himself is surely a direct agent acting on humanity within Japanese film traditions: either as our enemy/destroyer/agent of judgement or as our odd/mad protector. From space alien giant robots and other denizens of 'Monster Island' and such like.Here Godzilla seems remote to humanity as a whole. Apart that is, from one American family possessed of truly prodigious 'right place right time' capacity. It's good to see that they read film scripts too!As another attempt to make an American version of a Godzilla film this is to my mind a failure.For me the actual artistic design of Godzilla has some good in it and his smashing sky scrapers with impacts from his prone body is actually quite cool in it's solid way. The skydiving military sequence is a proper piece of blockbuster filmmaking in my opinion.Therefore personally I rate this film 3/10; a notch above barely dismal level because one or two sequences of good visuals, one scene outstanding, are included.",3,1,2,15 November 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Carnival
","Fury Road has a great feature, and that is Charlize Theron, who gives a commanding performance in what is a selfless savior hero role: driven to act by desperate revulsion at her life and forlorn hope of redemption. She plays this really well, and certainly the film is centred on her almost character experience.Besides this the film displays itself like a symphony of carnival tricks, complete with clown and freak performers in a mad madly of heightened improbability; building to extensive intensely choreographed almost physical comedy routines.Max in all of it seems less a road warrior and more of a trapeze artist teetering above a big tent cacophony.If you like it you probably love it, but personally I only appreciated Charlize Theron's impeccable contribution.In terms of story telling, beneath the clownish stylistic surface features, there isn't anything else of note to see here in my opinion. Nothing remarkable or particularly new for this genre or this filmmaker.I personally prefer Mad Max 2 by a margin and overall I like the etchings of daily decay evidenced by the original Mad Max at the initiation of this property.I do see much style and practical artifice and one standout turn in Fury Road so I give this film a STRONG 5/10 score in my personal ratings",5,2,3,14 November 2019

","After the disjointed shambles that was 'Prometheus' 'Alien: Covenant' seems to confirm that making prequels to the classic 'Alien' is simply a bad idea. Whatever Ridley Scott can conceive of is not as good as the vacuum of unknowns from which the initial monsters sprung in that original film.For some reason metaphysics and pseudo 'hi-culture' themes are layered inexpertly onto a monster movie franchise.The plot requires levels of willful ignorance on the part of its cast of characters and, just as much, on the audience to make any kind of narrative sense; probably because this is an oddly positioned bridge between two films that occupy almost unrelated creative locations in 'Alien' and 'Prometheus' despite their sharing a director and a cinematic franchise.The result is a boring and derivative film.However a couple of the action sequences are well staged, particularly the rescue scene. Also the reappearance of iconic designs in the aliens life cycle is nice to see; especially the movements of the adult xenomorph, which in various scenes of 'Alien: Covenant' harks back to its upright stiff 'Alien' appearance and it's more charging 'Aliens' and it's animal like 'Alien3' designs.All characters apart from the female lead are almost completely underwritten and, barring the stand in captain, forgettable.Death scenes and horror sequences are barely horrifying due to a complete lack of emotional resonance let alone raw human emotional saturation.I rate 4/10 because I liked some of the xenomorph design work and the rescue sequence in particular was pretty well staged and developed 'outrageous exploits' stuff: good fun.However the rest is so repetitive and recycled from the alien franchise, other film of Scott's, and unrelated sci fi films of the last 30 years and so blandly handled by a director who appears more preoccupied by unnecessary and un-illuminating pondering that this is definitely a low point in a franchise which is starting to collect quite a lot of them.I think that the alien franchise has a good horror monster movie still in it, but I now doubt if Ridley Scott is a man capable of making it.",4,3,5,11 January 2020
The Martian," The Middling
","Charismatic leading actors can elevate films of they are well cast and 'The Martian' illustrates this point better than most. Matt Damon has enough screen presence to carry this mess off and carry the audience along with him.A large and illustrious production team also maintain acceptably high production standards and fairly imaginative production design work.....although at no single point did I think that anything looked like it couldn't have easily been filmed on Earth in a studio on a sound stage or semi dessert location. There wasn't a single moment of remarkableness in the visual design of the film.The artistic designs of the space vehicles and space travel seemed particularly unremarkable compared to other contemporary space sci-fi films.The script was miserably distracted from the fairly routine 'Lone survivor' narrative structure of 'carrying on surviving at any cost' main plot by silly space stories about loads of mundane things: such as extremely likely threats and risks to possible near-future spacefarers; and scientific/engineering challenges, being treated utterly incredibly and implausibily.I did not find this ratio of straight and silly to be a harmonious tonal balance.Thank heavens for Matt Damon. The stand out feature of this feature film. All the other actors could have been 'anyones', their characters certainly were.Ridley Scott made excellent films, sadly, he now seems to make indulgent films referential only to his own preoccupations. How will his 21st century ouvre be compared to his 20th? My answer is frankly: 'unfavourably'.I rate a 4/10 for a film that greatly disappointed me, but I'd recommend this firmly to Matt Damon fans and indeed, with rather more qualification, to anyone appreciative of star power/screen presence/ leading actors",4,0,1,23 February 2020
