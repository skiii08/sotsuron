Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," like watching a kid play with muppets
","This movie has to be one of the most disappointing pictures ever released. First a recap of the originals. Star Wars-great, stands on its own; Empire- expands on the first one and goes even deeper; Jedi- Good for kids but just rehashed plots from the first one, also got too cute, but still pretty good. This prequel is only a big expensive toy for George Lucas to play with. Bad script, Bad acting, (esp Jake Lloyd, where was the kid from the Sixth Sense?) with everyone stands around and recites stupid lines, cardboard characters... I can't go on I'm too depressed, taking a great franchise and ruining it. If I sound harsh,I am. These were movies I grew up with and now I have a bad taste in my mouth. I will see the other two coming out because i'm a glutton for punishment. Please Mr. Lucas, make them better. For fans who Star Wars can do no wrong, they will like it anyway. But for movies buffs who just like good movies please don't ruin a once great thing.",1,2,4,18 April 2000

You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.AndBernstein: Old age.

Singin' in the Rain," Not only a great musical,a great movie
","One thing I noticed in reading the comments of this movie is that nobody recognized the screenplay by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Without their screenplay the movie does not get made. It is a great script that was made better by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donens' fluid direction. Everything in this movie glides effortlessly. Throw in dancing by Donald O'connor, Debbie Reynolds, Cyd Charisse and of course Gene Kelly, Great songs and the willingness of producer Arthur Freed to let the creative people to do their thing and you have a classic.",10,85,114,20 February 2001
