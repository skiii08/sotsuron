The Blair Witch Project," I'm glad that I only rented it.
","After all of the hype we've heard, we rented 'The Blair Witch Project,' I'm relieved we didn't pay for a theater ticket to see it.  I will admit that I was impressed by the actors,  the characters were very believable.  The story did a good job of building up for an exciting conclusion, but that exciting conclusion never happened. I understand that the budget didn't allow for special effects, but come on, show us something!  Maybe with its financial success they can afford to make an actual  conclusion.",Null,0,0,27 October 1999
