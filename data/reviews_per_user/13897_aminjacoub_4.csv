Sucker Punch," Where is my joystick?
","I am fan of director Snyder, mostly because of movie Watchmen, which I really liked a lot. However Sucker Punch left me with different opinion. The plot is really interesting, and the atmosphere is mostly like it is in 300 and Watchmen, but... the concentration of synthetic CGI effects (even band from time to time) with mixing all kinds of well known characters, concepts and suggestions from various movies (Orcs from Lord, Matrix, I Robot... etc etc) results in feel more like it is some kind of movie techno video game goulash.The parts that are out of CGI sequences are fine, even the ending which is enjoyable. Because of those so much video game like parts I did not like the movie.If you are classic movie concept lover you will probably avoid this, or maybe share the same opinion, maybe. Maybe I am too conservative? Fot the conclusion what I admire the most here is that I had great resolution without need of some ultra quality graphic card, and only thing that was missed was a joystick.And what I really hate here is destroying the great Jefferson Airplane song: 'White Rabbit'.",1,6,13,19 June 2011
Brave," Great and touching
","Many reviewers have bad opinion about this movie. Many have mediocre opinion as well, but there are some of us that thinks that Brave is great. Oscar winning is not an absolute measure, but still reveals something about quality. Roger Ebert which is not among us anymore and which reviews I admire a lot, wrote that this movie kids will love, while parents will not. I am not a parent but I am in a mature age to be one, and I liked it. It even brings tears on, which only few movies, and not one animation till this one did. I will not put much criticism about it, but it is very subjective opinion of such admiration from me. The animation is really amazing, and the sceneries are fascinating. I am myself a fan of anything Scotissh and Irish, so the complete background of the movie fits more than well to me. It is funny, sometimes very funny, and it is very emotional, especially the ending, which is very happy indeed. I don't know much about background story of it, but I really liked it a lot, and I think there must be an audience that liked it same as me. It is innocent, brave and very positive; like the animation movies I remember from the old days.",10,5,11,30 May 2013
Super 8," Back to the 80ies?
","Now we have here bunch of good reviews, so I will not repeat the obvious as many perceived about this movie, nor will analyze the facts or anything else about it, only to express general feeling about it.Well what is so obvious it is that we have the same plot concept as it is with great titles like it is ET, Goonies, 1941., Stand by Me, and also IT which marked 80ies with its unique concept of friendship, and battle for moral and positive virtues, from perspective of kids.I like this movie from that side, as it perfectly fits in it, and it seems to me it is some kind of nostalgia from director. The influence of Spielberg is obvious here.Now, I am someone that lived in that era, and was the same age as it is our characters in this movie, so all that put me in state of nostalgia. I admit, the movie is great made as an clone of movies from that era.But what I don't like is that we don't have nothing new or fresh, just that repeated nostalgic concept from different perspective.I don't have a kid so I can't gave any conclusions how the young generations perceive it, but in time we live where everything is so fast and violent I think this movie might be responded as very slow from the audience.So it is OK movie, brings back fine memories, but still not that good as titles mentioned earlier, and nothing so special, even we all expected something maybe better. But as a conclusion, it is OK.",4,0,2,25 June 2011
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Definitive fan movie
","Watched that movie on TV last night, and even I told myself I will avoid it when it came up I was interested to see how right I was.I am a fan of Brad Pitt but not so big fan of Angelina. She is really beautiful woman and I admire both of them in there noble activities they do in their life. However this movie is an obvious representation of their sex appeal and rare chance to see them both acting together.So this movie is by my opinion something made for pure enjoyment in both actors with all there charm and look, which is here more affected than art of acting. They both are professionals and you can see how good actors they are, but this movie with its stupid plot and lot of energy packed action, which I did not like is more oriented in their brand.So for die hard fans of both actors it is perfect fun. As for movie itself it is just high commercial stupid flick.",2,0,3,19 September 2011
