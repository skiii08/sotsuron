Lucky Number Slevin," easy on the eyes.
","This movie has style - snappy editing.. cheesy interiors.. The dialog gets on shaky ground at times; the back-and-forth quips don't quite have the cocky self assurance that you get in a Tarantino movie. It's a minor gripe though. Josh Hartnett's acting isn't out of this world, but he doesn't need to because even if he's not exactly pushing boundaries he delivers the lines with aplomb and charm. At times the talky parts dragged on a bit but the action sequences were quite well done. Bruce Willis phones in a boring-too-cool-for-school hit-man performance and Lucy Liu tries too hard to be quirky/cute/weird but doesn't exactly get it right. I personally found her annoying. And we've got Morgan Freeman playing Morgan Freeman Acting Cool in a Movie. Towards the end where things fall neatly into place, things pick up. I found that the flashbacks to Slevin's past were the most interesting bits of the movie, as well as the race. Visually, the film is pretty if repetitive at times. Watch this movie if you like Josh Hartnett and want to see him look good in a bath towel and a slightly f-d up nose, and don't expect anything profound.",Null,0,1,26 March 2007
