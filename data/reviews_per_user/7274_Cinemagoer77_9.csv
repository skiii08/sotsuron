Hereditary," Best horror film in years
","The movie opens with a funeral and the death of the main character's mother. You notice during the eulogy, no one is particularly overcome with grief..toni c's character was possibly raised by a narcissistic parent and we know the damage they can cause. Toni Colette had overcome and continued to do so as a loving parent. The sympathy and hope for t.c.s character was established well in my opinion.
The writer did this for a reason and it worked so we could suffer the horrific shock as to what lies ahead for the family. There is an emotional tragic tone as soon as the 1st 'tragedy' took place and it never goes away. It is horrific and gut wrenching. The horrific scene is seared into my brain. Toni Colette is that tearful mother. I don't really cry at horror films but I almost did watching that certain scene. I like Conan the barbarian movies and am no easy tear dropper. From then on you realize even though the grand mother is dead the effects from her life carry onward. The feeling of absolute desperation for the family to beat evil never went away for me. Some horror movies don't get the same reaction from me. But....all of this hope only to find out this is one absolutely bleak horror film that built tension, desperation, throughout, masterfully. I was wanting and hoping they would over come. Don't wrongs get righted? They do in many other horror films. The kids are basically innocent and even they were not immune to this evil bleakness grandma carried onto them. The ending ties it all up with the questions being answered and why this evil befell them and yes it is rather horrifying and disturbing. Not unique but done better than anything I have seen with similar stories. Some didn't care for it but i liked the slow build up and the ending answered what it needed to. I think it is a a better horror film compared to rose mary's baby. I only say this because that is what some have compared it to. This is a time when some horror movies can be made better than the older films with similar ideas. I believe this horror film was the best to come out in a long time. A film that horrified me like it is supposed to. I thought horror films were dead and lamented that the genre produces nothing horrific anymore so this film was direly needed. It is not perfect and i don't understand some of the scenes yet..i give it a 9 because it isn't perfect.",9,3,6,26 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Overrated time travel plot
","After Infinity Wars, how Thanos could be destroyed given the odds is what I wondered from the time i left the theatre last year until May 16, this year. In endgame, Thanos is killed early and then we are off on a back to the future, terminator time loop plot. The thing about backward time travel if it were possible, is once you go back you would create another timeline and they are infinite mind you. In infinity Wars, Dr. Strange would have been sitting there forever until he found all the ways Thanos could be killed, and it wouldn't be just one either out of infinite timelines. I really wished they didn't have that kind of plot. If there are infinite timelines then there are also more than one timelines in which they win. So then what is so special about the current story line? Iron man dies? Well thats ok bc he exists in several other timelines. I couldn't get the multiple timeline part of it out of my head to care about this plot and the characters...a better and unexpected ending could have been Ghost Rider showed up in that timeline and ended thanos somehow for the atrocities he had committed or they could regain the stones to recreate the characters taken after antman subatomically enters thanos and blows him up. The plot could have been anything but a back in time plot..i tried to enjoy it..i tried to get into uncharacteristic Hulk and Thor but the back to future plot killed it for me...they could all die and they could all have figured it out on another timeline what's special about any one individual in this movie then?.movie is overrated big time. Avengers Infinity war was such a great movie imo and inspired many a mind to think how to defeat Thanos..but end game's plot is cliched and was a lazy way to end it all..it might be ok for younger folks but the multiple timeline plot makes it a heavily flawed movie. Acting was good, too much cgi, a few funny lines ..it was ok ..not a 10 remotely.",6,1,4,25 July 2019
Midsommar," Excellent horror film about a cult
","This is generally a disturbing film. Some people say it was funny perhaps because they were uncomfortable with some scenes yet so many people were offended or hated it. So my guess is the movie made people uncomfortable. Again, it was a disturbing film which many horror films are not these days. I welcomed Ari's latest effort as horror is becoming non-horrific lately with so many tropes that the genre is lacking these days. The 1 star reviewers ignore the story telling, ignore any of the characters, ignore the symbolism that exists through the entire story, and ignore the creepiness of some of the sociopathic members. You should rewatch it just to see how evil their foreign friend actually is. It is atleast a 4 or 5 star minimum. I say this is a thinkers horror film because i had to rewatch twice. Although the movie is gory it doesn't glorify the actions of the cult members. You get the feeling the cults are indeed the abnormalities we know they are and it's a visceral feeling to see them carry out their rituals. Cults can be argued as the anti-thesis of progress/freedom and how they possess the means to attract people is just as baffling. Well Midsommar offered a glimpse into the cult via codependency and loss. Add in charming sociopathy who tell people what they like to hear and we have some poor people who get lead into horror and loss of freedom/love. As a cult film this is atleast 8. Also, The wicker man comparisons need to stop. How many posession movies are there and how many times need they be compared? Cult horror is a sub-genre like zombie films are also a sub-genre. This is an excellent film about the horrors of a cult for modern times. I really think Ari is becoming a true master of horror. He leaves many viewers disturbed but also with warnings and lessons about what evil really is. He does not glorify horror..rather he reveals
consequences..8 out of 10 for me..",8,6,8,25 November 2019
Psycho," Horror Masterpiece
","No one actor will ever recapture Anthony Perkins performance as Norman Bates. No one director then or after will recapture on film a slasher tale of Hitchcock proportions. One must think how bold a topic mental illness was for 1960. Well, Hitchcock masterfully created an authentic horror story filmed in black and white and entirely iconic using mental illness as the catalyst. So much homage is due to Hitchcock and his 1960 masterpiece, Psycho. No monsters, no supernatural powers just a boy and his bestfriend.",10,1,1,26 November 2019
Mother!," Watch this from an allegorical mind.
","You must view this film as an allegory completely and not from a real stand point. Look for the meanings behind every item, set piece, and character. He is God, Mother is Earth or Nature and you will start to see the entire allegorical telling of the bible beginning to end from Aronofsky's mind. Mother is creation personified. For the overall point of the movie, keep in mind, Mother is the protagonist for whom we are to sympathize with. The entire adam and eve (a pretty stone was the apple), cain and abel, flood happen symbolically then He develops writer's block but winds up writing the new testament eventually symbolically it's poems. People keep showing up like He is a celebrity so much that it hinders his relationship with Creation. Keep in mind there is a reason the writer chose to use this nature between He and the visitors and why it is told this way allegorically. The visitors even cause disturbance as to hinder He from his Creation to the point that Mother has to literally shut them out of her presence. There is like 20 minutes of humans acting up. Away from the mob, Creation gives birth to a son behind a closed and blocked door.
The baby is Jesus as strangers are frenzied to see her new son..He tells creation the people need to see the baby despite her fear of them. (shouldn't this be Mary?) He winds up taking the baby to some strange room with mostly unquestioning human beings. They wind up passing the baby around as Mother finds them and you hear the baby's neck break, killing him. If these are Christians, christians didn't kill Jesus in the bible, accidentally or not, the Romans delivered his crucifixion execution. The symbolism meaning doesn't match the bible if you ever read it. Mother hears this and is frantic for her son and barrels through the seemingly brainwashed people until she comes to an alter where the baby's carcass is found. She sees the crowd eating the baby's remains. I assume this is Aronofsky's view of the catholic tradition of the bread eaten as the body of Christ. So mother become's angry enough to start slicing people up for killing her son. So Creation cared about one person? Not He or anyone else? If so what is the meaning? But we get that Christians and He don't care like a non-religious symbol does. ..They wind up turning on Mother, and beating her. None of this allegorically even makes sense lol. God's humans are now beating up Mother. I felt this was odd and could not see the allegorical meaning and how those scenes fit into the bible allegory. Word is this was meant to be earth's inhabitants polluting the world so I guess Aronfsky just threw that in there and made them Christians lol. He tells Mother the people should be forgiven. Mother is distraught and winds up going to a place that will burn up everyone and ignites flames burning all including the house, except He. Mother awakens and is burnt up. He is there caring for her but she had enough of being used by He, exclaiming He never loved her. What's that Aronofsky biblical God is a narcissistic fan loving being? Remember Mother is the protagonist not He. Anynow, He is saddened briefly as Mother wastes away turning to ash. He digs into her chest and pulls out a stone (the one similar to before that got eve and adam kicked out of the house (eden) and places it on a mantle as the incinerated house is renewed again. He is just powerful this He. The screen fades or some other technique is used and we see another young woman or Mother all over again. Which you have to ask why heavily in allegorical tales? So why does He do this all over again? He is self serving narcissist. If Aronofsky read the bible, this new Mother won't happen like that..or is aronfsky saying you can't trust the bible book doesn't matter now * sigh If only Aronofsky was better of a worldly artist since he is so darn artsy his atheism didn't shine through. He seems devoted to twist the bible book to fit something in his own mind. Remember Noah? It was worse than the bible book..if you think the flood story is crazy aronofsky went crazier. What was the point to that movie? the use of allegory required a purpose..to give it meaning..so watch it a few times and realize this one man's view point. Those saying it is open to interpretation it almost isn't because the why comes up ..why the He and creation relationship dynamic, why the believers are a nuisance..those have meanings..some of the symbolism is used incorrectly..creation not Mary gives birth to Jesus ..ok so then why? Eventually allegory makes sense. Someone said this is art, well art is made for anyone to enjoy..When you look at a picasso, you see different things but no reaction would mirror this comment section. It is not a smart person's movie either. Allegory tales can change people what does this do? this movie is bold but it has no long carrying meaning for the world. A smart film if you don't like christianity wouldn't be this one. Watch an evolution video it is similar but without the blatant disregard toward specific humans beings on this planet. 3 stars for acting..and some of the sets.",3,0,0,26 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Pop culture behemoth
","If anything Lucas is a special effects genius and this is the film that started it all. .the story of the force was the first of it's kind both special effects wise, and story wise. This film deserves some respect in the cinematic universe. There are iconic characters in Skywalker, Vader. With that being said doesn't mean that a new hope is a script masterpiece. Even the film opens up with a gaping plot hole that can't be ignored. Droids getting away from the most feared organization in the galaxy with plans that would doom them and it is casually blown off by the empire? That wouldn't happen. We have a protagonist that doesn't cry when he discovers his beloved caregivers are brutally murdered andddd desecrated. What was in the script? Luke feels bad? We also have a princess who also reacts generically when she witnesses the empire destroy a planet? We have a space opera and not much emotion. What Lucas is? A special effects genius who brought the world his visionary saga but a new hope is hardly hard hitting in other areas. I am an avid star wars fan even at some point was a purist but have changed over the years. A new hope is remarkable for it's time and respect is given for the iconic characters as well. I can't merely rate it on nostalgia though it is a fun space fantasy film, but it is a flawed movie. Ps i won't discuss science fiction in star wars because it is a space fantasy and there is hardly any science in it. Hello? Cool spaceship sound effects? Doesn't happen!. It is fun and something to be respected though, i give it an 8.",8,0,0,27 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Lucas is some kinda genius in the world
","In a new hope, the wizard behind the scenes capable of using special effects tricks on a lower budget to create a mythological world from his mind was a suspected genius. Well, Empire confirms that Lucas wasn't a one trick pony and confirms he is a genius in the cinematic world through vision and special effects. This time with Empire we get to see more of the rich galaxy from Lucas's mind and a better emotional tone than the first film which i felt was too lacking considering the genocidal actions of the imperial forces. While some people defend the lack of better emotional reactions in a new hope i argue that emotional reactions validate cinematic hardships. Well, In a new hope, Luke had begun to develop a bond (he wanted to be a Jedi like his father) or tie to his father who had fallen but he doesn't know the revelation ahead of him. Obi Wan the only person to truly help Luke understand who he is and where he comes from has died but his tie to Luke is still there helping him early before Han rescues him. We begin to see more of what the force is and Hans character development too in the rescue. The musical score also adds to the films tone which is something the first film didn't have enough of..i know for some the beautiful music as luke looks toward the sunset was enough in a new hope but since the emotion was off everywhere else i thought a musical score could have helped out or even a pensive stare later lol In empire strikes back we have the dreaded empire theme preceding Vaders 1st appearance in the film. Iconic music!. Before Luke uses the force in the beginning we hear soft music that precedes Lukes force use in a life or death situation.its actually emotional..we begin to see the force is about feeling. Later on Yoda hints to young Luke of the force, all of it and how scary it can get. Force users can succumb to darkness. Vader was once a decent person. Yoda tells luke you will..you will be.. (afraid)..Yoda warns naive Luke basically to help him on his journey because the road ahead is extremely arduous, physically and emotionally. Every force user faces fear..yoda trains luke as much as possible given the time..luke knows his friends are in danger yet despite all warning luke chooses his friends over yodas and obi wans warning. Luke is actually seen as reckless but imo he is facing fear and runs to it actually. I can go on and on how empire strikes back is a fantasy masterpiece in space..everything has been said about this film and why it is historic. There are cinematic moments the world will never see or hear again. Period. Yes the plot isn't perfect, but it is how the story was told..even better than the first film mind you fantasy films are difficult to pull off..The only fantasy world that i can think of off the top of my head with decent characters was the earlier seasons of game of thrones. Fantasy films are not easy to pull off given the 2 to 3 hours time given. Lucas created a masterpiece in over 2 hours.
With all being stated, Empire strikes back revealed that at his best George Lucas is a visionary genius and the world will likely never see such an original story told on the big screen like this one.",10,0,0,28 November 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Miller's Magnum Opus
","My world is fire and blood. George Miller went full maestro mode. This is one of of those films that Miller was probably dreaming about for 40 years. This is a film in which his visionary concept is fully realized. He interweaves high octane action scenes throughout an unforgiving aussie post-apocalyptic world and it never comes off as unneeded or over done which is something the fast and furious franchise suffers from.
Some of the vehicles are battle armored v-8's that resemble metal beasts of hell. Some of the older films I am sure suffered from budget constraints and you won't see many vehicles lacking here.
Even though the movie is a big chase scene filled with Miller's stylized action the movie never loses it's humanity or soul. 'Out here, everything hurts.' These aren't shallow protagonists. Max suffers from ptsd. Furiosa isn't just an escapee. Everyone has suffered except the psychopaths. The reasons and motives make sense in that mad world.
I still respect Mel as Mad Max and I also see Hardy as Mad Max. Can you imagine someone else playing Rocky or Conan the barbarian maybe? Rocky no, Conan yes for me. Replacing actors is not an easy feat to pull off and coming from a super mad max fan, they pull it off right away.
The dialogue is minimal but catchy and appropriate to the scene. 'Say bye bye to the neck!' Instead of 'you're dead meat', is fun and memorable. You will never hear the word mediocre the same again. The manner in which the main villain labeling something mediocre to boys is hilarious. What a bully.
There is directorial genius to George Miller's mad world that can't be seen in any other action films and it isn't for everyone. It is an action masterpiece.",10,0,4,27 July 2019
The Martian," Science fiction blockbuster
","Fun movie with bad science. Even the premise is bad. Read about Mars dust storms if you would like to know but don't get me wrong, I love the science fiction genre for both entertainment and implication. I don't even mind bad science if there is decent character development example, Ad Astra, Gravity, etc. With that being said, the martian is a film that leans toward entertainment and carries an overall optimistic tone despite events that would likely bear great emotional, psychological affects on any realistic main character. I believe it to be a blockbuster geared to make money. I do think Matt Damon is a decent actor but I could think of better actors to portray a stranded astronaut but hey, excellent acting was not the films intended purpose. There is little character development. The film is fun to look at but it's a generic rescue story that little to chew on intellectually afterward.",6,0,0,27 November 2019
