Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," not disappointed......
","George Lucas takes a new brand of Star wars and uses it to shove two fingers up at the critics. The film is superb, breathtaking scenery, an interesting storyline and best of all, a red and black dude with a double sided lightsabre!!! Darth Maul almost surpasses Vader as the best baddie of all time and its a pity there isn't more of him. McGregor is brilliant in a difficult role and you will never see a better action sequence than the pod racing. If you don't like this film, you should be kept in a small room with padded walls. ROLL ON EPISODE TWO!!!!",8,0,0,23 July 1999
Gladiator," The first epic of the new millennium.
","Well, if you haven't seen it yet, what are you playing at? Make sure that you catch this work of art in the cinemas as it will never have the same impact if you watch on video.Gladiator has some of the most intense battle sequences I have ever seen as Ridley Scott puts masterfully puts the audience in the middle of the action. However, the movie doesn't just rely on gory battles to interest the reader. A superb script is ably supported by brilliant performances from Crowe, Reed and Phoenix(a revelation in the evil conniving role of Commodus)and Gladiator is actually an intelligent movie with a true action hero with brains as well as brawn.Up there with American Beauty as the best film of 2000 so far (UK) SEE IT NOW! 10/10.",10,0,0,17 May 2000
