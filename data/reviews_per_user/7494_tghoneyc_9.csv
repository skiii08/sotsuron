Mission: Impossible III," I give you 'Alias' the movie!
","From the opening frame this movie is an adrenaline rush, the perfect film to open the blockbuster season. Tom Cruise, backed by solid talent, returns as super-spy Ethan Hunt in the best entry in the franchise since he was hanging on the roof of a speeding-bullet train. With the creator of 'Alias' and 'Lost' at the helm, we are back in the backstabbing world of intelligence and espionage.The movie plays largely like 'Alias,' with Jennifer Garner switched out for Tom Cruise, and Ron Rifkin exchanged for Philip Seymour Hoffman. And while the drama has been cut down to fit into a two-hour action flick, the human element J.J. Abrams is so handy with is still present.Ethan Hunt has now gone into semi-retirement, training others to become members of Impossible Mission Force. He is engaged to a lovely nurse (Michelle Monaghan), and all her friends and relatives couldn't be more happy to see her finally settling down with a man who seems to be the perfect guy. But the night of his engagement party Hunt is contacted by his handler, Musgrove (Billy Crudup, at his most subtle). Apparently a former protégé of Ethan's (Keri Russell) has disappeared while following a mysterious weapons dealer, Owen Davian (Hoffman). Hunt predictably accepts the mission, and reunites with likable hacker Luther Stickell, as well as two new recruits (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Maggie Q).I was surprised and disappointed with myself after watching. I believe I'm actually starting to let the media and gossip go to my head about Tom Cruise. Yeah, I won't deny he's a little cuckoo, but he's still a good actor, and to let that get in the way of enjoying the movie is just pathetic.Ving Rhames, as Luther, has been promoted to full buddy/partner status. On top of keeping the junior agents in order, he remains something of a straight-man to Cruise's increasingly volatile agent. Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of those villains that are just so bad that it actually becomes fun to watch them kick the hero's ass, because you know he'll get his comeuppance in the end, but he could have used a little more screen time. And some of the best one-liners were distributed quite evenly between Simon 'Shaun of the Dead' Pegg as a British version of 'Alias''s Marshall Flinkman, and Laurence Fishburne as the head of IMF. 'Well I don't think it's fair that chocolate makes you fat, but I ate my share and, well...' You can always trust that Cruise will make it through, but the fun comes from watching the rest of the cast act around him, especially Rhames, Hoffman, Fishburne, and Pegg. Scientology aside, it's two quick hours that I was happy to give up.",8,0,2,6 May 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Absolutely the Best Movie of 2006
","Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro revisits the world he explored first in the awesome 'The Devil's Backbone,' that of the Spanish Civil War. Only this time it's 1944 and the war has just ended. Only a few rebel groups are left to be defeated by Franco's army. The story here is set at one of the rural outposts where militia forces occupy the forest near an old mill.Ivana Baquero is Ofelia, a ten-year-old girl who travels with her pregnant mother to meet her stepfather, the sadistic Captain Vidal, who cares only about two things: that his son be born at the mill, and that he fulfill his duty and put down the uprising.Ofelia's only friend is Mercedes ('Y tu mama tambien''s Maribel Verdu), a serving girl who is feeding information to the rebels. After figuring out who she is, Ofelia agrees to keep her secret because she likes Mercedes, and fears Captain Vidal.To escape the violence, Ofelia loses herself among fairies and a faun who resides in an ancient labyrinth behind the mill. The faun (played by Doug Jones of Del Toro's 'Hellboy') explains to Ofelia that she is a princess who must complete three tasks in order to prove that she isn't mortal, and can be admitted back to her kingdom.The first of her missions is to destroy an obese frog who has burrowed inside a giant fig tree and is killing it. The scene is pretty funny, but every time she goes on one of these missions she gets berated by her mother, who seems to be even more afraid of Vidal than anyone else.Del Toro masterfully interweaves the real and surreal elements of the story, balancing them perfectly to create a flawless mix of real tension and magic. She must contend with her mother's worsening condition in pregnancy, and Vidal's growing impatience with her presence at the mill. The rebels know the terrain, but Vidal's men are better equipped, and more fierce. The violence in the movie is quite graphic and heart-wrenching.Sergi Lopez, as Captain Vidal, should take up residence as one of the great villains of cinema. Lopez imbues in Vidal the kind of humanity that seemed absent in Eduardo Noriega's Jacinto from 'Backbone'. As such he is a much scarier person. Vidal is the son of a military man who died in the line of duty. His only wish is to follow in his father's footsteps. But first, he must have a son to follow in his. And for this he has no room to care much for Ofelia, or her ailing mother, so long as his son is delivered.As the other great villain of the movie, Del Toro gives us the Pale Man, a murderous white creature (also Doug Jones) with eyes in his hands and long sharp claws. In his banquet hall there are paintings of him with piles of dead children mounted around him. Truly a menacing figure. His memory is not easy to shake.This often-shocking film is certainly not for small fry--it would surely give them nightmares--but it is an odyssey that must be seen to be believed. Drawing from a number of fairy tales, Del Toro has created an original work that goes far to become in my opinion the best movie I have seen this year, and certainly Del Toro's masterwork.",10,4,9,30 January 2007
Edward Scissorhands," E.T. meets Frankenstein (1931)
","Tim Burton is one of the true auteurs of our time. He manages to put his label on virtually any project he takes on. And this is arguably his masterpiece. Excepting the 'Batman' movies, the only other Tim Burton-directed movie that seemed to truly bring out his dark imagination is 'Sleepy Hollow.' My personal favorite is 'Beetlejuice,' but that is more for sentimental reasons than anything else.Johnny Depp is the title character, a Frankenstein monster who has been left in the large, abandoned mansion of an inventor. The mansion sits at the edge of a small suburban neighborhood where the housewives' only function is to spread gossip. Edward is discovered by Peg Boggs, 'the Avon lady,' after her unsuccessful bi-yearly visit to the homes of all the women in the neighborhood. Edward is brought home to the Boggs residence, and before they get home everyone already knows there's a tall pale man riding with Peg.The neighborhood is already full of kooks. Kathy Bates eats up her role as Joyce, the neighborhood slut, there's the overweight woman with curlers in her hair whose hobby is to stare out the window and spread gossip about what she sees. And Esmerelda, the neighborhood outcast, who raises hell, quite literally, when she sees Edward.Bill Boggs is a friendly man who is not above drawing the line somewhere. He just wants Edward to fit in. The Boggs' son, Kevin, is wowed by Edward, and even ventures to take him to show-and-tell. When their daughter, Kim arrives home, it is initially the entrance of someone who couldn't possibly be from the same family, but then we're reminded she's a teenager who has all sorts of inexplicable issues with her family already. For Edward it's love at first sight, or something like that, because being alone for so long, she's the first truly beautiful thing he's seen since he came down. Unfortunately, she's already attached to Jim, the spoiled bully who initially finds Edward amusing and pathetic, until Kim begins to like him, too, and stops seeing Jim. It's nice that as hateful as Jim is, we can see where it came from. He's the son of filthy rich parents. He never had to worry growing up. But his father won't buy him a car like he wants, he wants him to build character and earn the money himself. They have a top-of-the-line security system. And they are completely absent for the entire duration of the movie. We don't know these people, we just know what Jim tells us, and Jim doesn't think too highly of them, and as a senior in high school, he doesn't understand why they are the way they are.The cast is first-rate and inspired. Viewed in flashbacks, Vincent Price, as Edward's inventor 'father,' is a misguided man so fascinated by his own creations. It's no surprise Burton cast him, since he seems to have a great admiration for classic horror, and as one of his later roles, it serves the actor well. As Price plays him, he's not an evil person. He's just too old to finish what he started. Alan Arkin and Diane Wiest are perfectly cast. Their sensibilities as actors complement their characters, as middle-class every-men and women. Kathy Baker makes the most of her slutty character, Joyce. Anthony Michael Hall, for those who know John Hughes' films, might be the most surprising. Looking back at his dorky beginnings, who would have expected Hall to ever be so menacing? And then of course there's Johnny Depp. This is, I think, the movie that made him known, although he didn't rise to star status until 2003 with the character of Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp doesn't say much, but it's in his face and body movements that touches people. He is a tragic figure. He comes into the neighborhood like E.T., a freak with a heart of gold, but he's forced out by a mob of people who aren't so much eager to kill him, like Frankenstein, as they are eager to see what becomes of him. The women of the town are the kinds of people who buy tabloids at the supermarket, and so, as long as they don't know, they want to find out.Tim Burton seems to have made this movie as a critique of suburban life. This isn't 'Desperate Housewives' by any means, but a cruel and yet sincere observation of the human psyche, and what happens when everyone finds out.",8,1,2,11 February 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Now I see what all the fuss is about...
","I never doubted this movie was good, but I was eager to find out why it was good. And I was, of course, curious about the 'plot twist' everyone was talking about.This is an incredible little movie. Keep in mind that it is 'little,' because with all the awards this movie has taken home already, some might be fooled into thinking it is more than that. But hey, little is good.If you don't know already what the story is about, I'll give you a brief synopsis. Ageing, haunted Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) owns an old boxing gym. He is so full of guilt over his estranged daughter, Katie, whom he hasn't seen in years, and who refuses to read his letters, that he goes to mass every day. It's starting to get on the nerves of his priest. His only friend is Scrap (Morgan Freeman), a former fighter who watches over the place for Frankie, and keeps people in line.Frankie has a good fighter he's managing, but he doesn't like risks. He's holding him back from a title shot. His fighter likes Frankie, but he wants his shot at the title. He realizes if he's going to get anywhere, he needs to look elsewhere. Simultaneously, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank), a white-trash waitress from Missouri, wants to learn how to fight. Frankie won't train her, until he realizes her potential, and is egged on by Scrap. That's as much detail as should probably be revealed.The movie is almost entirely shot in underexposed film, giving it a dark, washed-out look that complements the boxing theme. It's like the entire movie takes place in a boxing ring, and that's where the lighting and colors are most alive. Eastwood has made a superb follow-up to his masterpiece of scarred Bostonians, 'Mystic River.' Like that film, this one has a strong undercurrent of Irish heritage and Catholicism. Frankie reads Gallic in his spare time, and even gives Maggie a nickname in the language. The detail given to the environment is also very similar. While in 'Mystic River' everything seemed cold and stark, here it's just dark and claustrophobic. This is a smaller movie, but it is just as good.And everyone in the movie gives first-rate performances. Hilary Swank has tapped into that same great ability that won her the Oscar for 'Boys Don't Cry.' I have always liked Morgan Freeman, and a lot of other people have, too, I know, but after a number of relative duds, he's reminded me why he's such a good actor. And finally, the real treat is Clint Eastwood. Some people may have written him off as a man who can't really act much. But either way, he's almost always played the same tough, hard-edged characters, people who at some point or other are willing to take a stand. Here, that persona, his persona, is not even there. Here, he is a man who has been falling apart for some time, and has payed the price for holding people back. But he unfolds into a man of compassion, who just wishes he could have the chance to fix his mistakes in life. The fact that he's seventy-four and looks it only helps in conveying his inner demons.This I know is not a movie for people who don't like to watch boxing movies. I don't like boxing, but movie depictions can be good. There are some bits of dry humor in the movie, and some that even take place inside the ring. The movie is also very heartrending. If you don't care for deeply emotional movies, don't watch it. But I personally give it a 10.",10,2,4,6 February 2005
The Fountain," The most visually stimulating movie of the year
","Okay, I'm not one of those people who loves to hype up a movie, and considering the mixed reviews this one's received, there isn't, I suppose, much risk of people taking what I say too seriously.That said, and in all seriousness, this is a fantastic piece of cinema! Darren Aronofsky, one of the most visually gifted directors working today, has created a masterwork so radically different from his previous two forays into the medium that comparing this to either his debut, 'Pi,' or 'Requiem for a Dream' would be unfair to what this has to offer on its own. Granted, it also means that just because you liked those movies doesn't mean you'll like this one.Aronofsky has created a complex, time-tripping story about love, obsession, life, death, and rebirth. Tom Creo is a man floating through space, with a tree, toward a dying star in the far future. He is a present day doctor who is searching for a way to reverse the effects on a chimp named Donovan, in the hope that the same can be done for his wife Izzy. He also imagines himself the protagonist in his wife's journal of a Conquistador who is sent to New Spain (Guatemala) during the Spanish Inquisition by Queen Isabella, with the mission of finding the Tree of Life.Cutting back and forth in time, through present and future and past, and leaving much unanswered, it is not the story itself that is important, the the themes at work here.Hugh Jackman gives the best dramatic performance I have seen b a lead actor all year. Something of a control freak, he goes to pieces when the one absolute - death - takes his wife from him.Rachel Weisz is the innocent, his opposite and equal, who is a bit of a free spirit. She prefers to leave things to fate. She conveys the fragile but fearless existence of Izzy, and the commanding vulnerability of the Queen of Spain.Ellen Burstyn and Aronofsky favorite Mark Margolis in particular offer great support to the two stars, as do Cliff Curtis, Ethan Suplee, and Stephen McHattie, as the Grand Inquisitor. But it is Jackman who shines the brightest, and Weisz who seals the deal.This, more than anything, is a film about ideas, and Aronofsky does a masterful job of showing these ideas unravel.P.S. There is a small twist with regard to the Tree of Life, but this movie isn't about twists.",9,0,1,3 December 2006
The Departed," Scorsese's Back!
","As an avid fan of the original 'Infernal Affairs' I can say this one just about equals it. Borrowing a premise and a few memorable scenes, it creates an original vision by substituting the Irish gangs of South Boston for the Chinese mob of the first film.Jack Nicholson, as mob boss Frank Costello, creates an honestly larger-than-life character. A monster who chews scenery as only Jack could. The first scenes feature a younger Costello, roaming his neighborhood in the mid '80s, and help set the pace of the entire movie as he recruits and trains a young boy named Colin Sullivan--later to join the State Police in the form of Matt Damon.Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is probably the film's best performance as the other side of the coin, Billy Costigan, recruited by fatherly Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his controversial colleague Sgt. Dignam (an explosive Mark Wahlberg). With few exceptions, DiCaprio has never really fit his roles (he was great in 'The Aviator,' but he looked too young). Here he perfectly portrays the manic, stressful situation he's been placed in as the cop infiltrating Costello's crew of thugs.Both men end up falling for psychiatrist Madolyn (the very talented Vera Farmiga) in what feels like a Hollywood love-triangle. But given the rather low-key way it is played out, it doesn't feel too corny, despite the improbability.Alec Baldwin offers some hilarious scene-stealing moments as Damon's superior. And British actor Ray Winstone gives a cold, menacing performance as Costello's bodyguard, Arnold French.Scorsese's direction feels fresh, not necessarily from his style, so much as the cross-cutting style he uses feels so totally different from anything else out there recently. And his use of music, as always, works to great benefit.The cast is absolutely stellar. William Monaghan really gives these characters depth. Jack does too. And Scorsese is at the top of his game once again.All I will say about the ending is, I thought I'd never see a movie end this way. But to be vague, it's all tied up in the end.Will this movie win Oscars? Maybe. It's got the acclaim, but I still wouldn't be surprised if it gets overlooked for whatever reason.",9,3,6,11 October 2006
Ray," Good Movie, Great Performance
","I would not be the least surprised if Jamie Foxx wins Best Actor. The Academy likes to acknowledge actors who go to lengths to change themselves for their performance, (see Best Actress 2003, 2004) and Foxx is also a master of mimickry, which has catapulted him to true stardom, beyond the restraints of his roles in dumb comedies. Coupled with his work in Michael Mann's 'Collateral,' he has turned out impressive, landmark performances in his career that are sure to elevate him to the top ranks of Hollywood.Taylor Hackford's almost-three-hour biopic has its share of flaws. No big surprise in such films, especially when following the life of a pop icon such as Ray Charles, or Mohammed Ali. Thankfully, though, for what it's worth, this movie's leisurely running time, while annoying at times, helps to make it more rounded, and not so 'Ray did this, and then Ray did that five years later,' something that was one of the more obvious flaws in 'Ali.' Here, Foxx is allowed to fully embody the late musician. And while the movie only tells his story up to 1965, when it ends rather abruptly and unpleasantly, the combination of Charles' music and the excellent acting of Foxx, Kerry Washington (as his wife), Sharon Warren (as his mother), and Regina King (as his mistress, one of the Raylets), make it work.Hackford paints a flawed picture of Ray, one that doesn't go for glorification, but spends a lot of time with his heroin addiction, his numerous affairs, and, as his success grows, the severing of loyalties to his friends. At the same time, his genius, music, and better qualities still manage to shine through. Hackford may not have been the director to bring Ray Charles' life to the screen, but Foxx certainly was the actor to make it ring true.9/10",Null,2,3,3 November 2004
Lord of War," A necessary evil...
","The master of film allegories, Andrew Niccol, has created a much more topical story than in his previous films, and one that deals with the problems of today, rather than the trials of tomorrow, and he has done it with just as much flare for character dilemma.During the opening credits, we are treated to the life of a single bullet in an AK-47. From its manufactuing in a Soviet factory, until it is loaded into an assault rifle and fired into the forehead of a Liberian preteen. From that point on we are treated to the inner-workings of the illegal weapons trade, and the violence that results from it, though seen primarily through the eyes of our protagonist, Yuri Orlov.The cast is stellar. Nicolas Cage dominates the screen as a man without a country who goes from the mean streets of New York's Little Odessa to become a leading exporter of guns. Told in first-person, we are forced to identify with him, despite his decidedly amoral business. Jared Leto lends great support as his wayward brother and one-time partner, whose sense of right and wrong become his ultimate undoing. Ethan Hawke is also in top form as Interpol agent Jack Valentine, who is only prevented from catching Yuri by his strong belief in upholding international law. Ian Holm adds another creepy character to his resume as Simeon Weisz, Yuri's nemesis in the world of arms trade. Bridget Moynihan, as Yuri's dream girl-turned-wife is also quite good.The synopsis talks about a gun-runner at the top of his game being attacked by his conscience. This is true, but it's never as simple as all that. The movie makes its point by largely avoiding it. We hear the shots, we see the victims, but only once are we treated to a lecture on the evils of arms dealing. We've heard it all before. We know it's bad. We don't need to hear any more than we are given. By converting the facts of gun running into 'wrong' or 'evil,' Niccol avoids being preachy. While 'The Constant Gardner' succeeded by preaching the evils of the pharmaceutical industry, 'Lord of War' succeeds because we already know why the gun running is wrong.This movie ends on a cynical note, that in the world of today there will always be war, and there will always be someone needed to supply the guns. And sometimes, in cases of conflicts sponsored by other countries, it helps to have someone on the outside.",8,3,7,17 September 2005
Casino Royale," James Bond for the 21st Century
","After all the controversy Daniel Craig has proved his mettle as a Bond for the new generation of moviegoers.Darker, more realistic in tone, 'Casino Royale' is the long-awaited adaptation of Ian Fleming's first book chronicling the adventures of 007, everyone's favorite British superspy. If it weren't for the necessity of introducing the spy as though he never existed, I don't know if Craig, a fine actor in his own right, would have been so impressionable had he been in just the next in the long-running franchise. That they quite explicitly are starting over, makes more sense in terms of who Bond is and what he's about.The film is less humorous than other movies, but a lot of the humor does stem from the sly references to the long-standing, immediately recognizable facets of what makes Bond Bond. 'Shaken or stirred?' 'Does it look like I give a damn?' Vesper Lynd in her introduction to Bond 'I'm the Money.' 'And worth every Penny.' Craig, in addition to turning in one of the best post-Connery Bonds, is, like Connery, an actor with considerable range. He's also got a bit of a following already. He's still a womanizer who, in this case, fancies married women, who are by nature lonely and dependent on their spouses. Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) is, in this case, everything Bond dislikes about women: cold, confident, and single--in essence, she is exactly like him. A great scene transpires where they analyze each other's character based on first impressions, nailing several qualities about each other that is symbolic of things to come. Thankfully, the scriptwriters did not have to go far to make Vesper a modern woman, as Fleming's own description of her was that she was beautiful with brains.Mads Mikkelsen, ever the character actor, imbues the treacherous Le Chiffre with all sorts of eccentricities. Asthmatic, with an eyelid that weeps blood, he is also seen as a pawn in a much larger game. Desperate for money, and with investors out for blood, he is prepared to do whatever it takes to stay in their good graces.The action scenes are exciting and full of amazing stuntwork, especially in the beginning, when Bond pursues a bomb-maker through a construction site. Non-actor Sebastien Foucan does some amazing acrobatic stuntwork, slipping his tall body through vents and making enormous vaults and leaps, where Bond has to improvise quite heavily to catch up with him.Most of the movie is spent trying to figure out who James Bond is. And we are left satisfied. If the movie seems to drag a little too long, it is worth it, just to hear him say the most famous line of the whole franchise.While Brosnan's suave portrayal of Bond as a dinosaur of the Cold War period worked well, here Craig gives us a man more atuned to modern cynicism and vulnerability, when the enemy is more elusive.",10,0,2,17 November 2006
