The Sound of Music," An Uplifting Movie
","The Sound Of Music is a classic of the musical genre and is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. The plot concerns a young Austrian woman called Maria (Julie Andrews) who is studying to be a nun in a convent and is sent to be a governess of the Von Trapp family by the Mother Abbess who feels that Maria would be more happy if she left the convent. During her stay, the Von Trapp family's lives begin to change forever. The dialogue is brilliant as every sentence suits each character and really brings them to life making you identify with them. The musical numbers are well-written and are some of the catchiest I've ever heard in a musical with songs such as 'Favourite Things' and 'So Long, Farewell' staying in my head for days and a beautiful score along with it. I also have to point out the engaging cinematography of Robert Wise who provides us with magnificent views of landscapes of the hills and mountains which really is the icing on the cake. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend anyone who loves cinema to watch this movie.",10,5,7,13 December 2015
The Big Lebowski," A Cult Classic

In addition to a hilarious script, it features a eclectic soundtrack of the likes of Bob Dylan, Captain Beefheart and Creedence Clearwater Revival which fits the mood of the movie. After seeing this movie, I would now put this film amongst my favorites and recommended that everybody see it. The dude abides....",10,0,2,6 December 2015
