The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The Perfect Film!
","I would call myself a hardcore film fan. I love art house movies and I love films that other people would find strange. I basically love films that the average movie-goer would not like. So when it comes to films which appeal to the casual consumer, I am not always a big fan. Movies have to do a great job to please me. Having said all that, this film BLEW ME AWAY!!!I expected this film to be a very by-the-numbers kind of film and it was anything but. The acting was incredible. The lead actor in particular was stunning, as was the performance of the other actors. The story was also surprising and contained a few twists which I did not see coming. Also the actors portrayed characters we've all seen in our schools. This air of familiarity gives this coming-of-age story a vibrancy very few movies have. I also think the fact that the film was directed by the author of the book it is based on did it huge favours.The film was nostalgic, witty and, most of all, courageous in handling it's subject-matter. I loved every second of it and have seen the film at least 3 times since it was released. The film may seem like your average high school movie but it has layers and layers of depth.I think this is a PERFECT FILM and definitely warrants a place in my top 10 films of all time. It is not many times I say this, but I do not know of any way this film could have been improved upon.Oh yeah, let's not forget the awesome soundtrack!",10,1,1,31 January 2014
Gravity," Sandra Bullock's Masterclass
","This film was amazing in it's visuals and it's ground-breaking CGI. But one thing that stood out to me was the incredible performance by Bullock. She was simply mesmerising.This film has the entertainment we all want to see when watching a space movie. It also has layers of depth not seen in many blockbusters nowadays. The themes of rebirth and sorrow are hammered home in a visually stunning way.However, the most incredible thing about the film was Bullock. She impressed me in every way. One scene in particular stands out (all I will say is that there was some barking involved!).George Clooney was also great, despite his short screen time. Overall, I think this was a highly entertaining flick which is technologically and emotionally incredible. And did I mention how GREAT SANDRA BULLOCK WAS!",9,1,2,31 January 2014
Spirited Away," Splendid soundtrack, average film.
","After years of hearing how incredible this film is I decided to give it a go. I should say that I don't usually watch anime but I do love animated features such as Lion King, Toy Story and Ratatouille. I could understand what the film was trying to do by letting the viewer experience a fairytale world come to life. The animation was also vibrant and quite incredible from an artistic and technical point of view. However, I could not help but feel let down by the lack of substance in the story telling. I did not get most of the characters and didn't like many of the characters other than the protagonist who was okay. Her parents, who are meant to be the reason she goes through this difficult journey, seem like snobs and as such the little girl's trials ultimately feel pointless. Although I should add that the last 15 minutes are very touching and make the film seem worthwhile watching. Definitely watch it to see if it's your cup of tea but as I much as I like animated films, I will not be returning to this one as I have to countless other Pixar/Disney films.",5,5,11,12 January 2014
Les Mis√©rables," Perfect Movie..........A musical for those who don't like musical
","It is very rare that a movie makes you feel the way this film does. Also, I am not a big fan of musicals and have only seen a few film adaptations of musicals over the years. Therefore, it is fair to say that I went into this film with a fair deal of scepticism. However, as soon as this film began I knew I was in for a ride. By the time the credits rolled I was nearly in tears and I am sure most of you will be. To start with, the music and the actors singing the music are absolutely superb. The music is as emotional as it gets and ties in amazingly well with the film's themes. In addition, there is not one actor who doesn't pull his or her weight to make this the musical masterpiece which it is. Essentially, the main theme running throughout the film is oppression and this is conveyed in stunning fashion by Hugh Jackman who steals the show and leaves you breathless for the 2 1/2 hour running time. His voice and facial expressions depict a man who has endured endless suffering and pain and is still willing to sacrifice more to help those in need such as Ann Hathaway's character. However, he is not a perfect human being and makes mistakes which he tries to rectify and this is why we root for him. By the end of the film he feels more like a close friend than an actor.All other actors such as Ann Hathaway and Russell Crowe deliver near-perfect performances and are also amazingly talented in the singing department. You would struggle to hold back the tears once you hear Ann Hathaway singing, the now infamous song, 'I dreamed a dream'. Despite what other critics say, Russell Crowe's character is also portrayed in stunning fashion by the immensely talented actor who we all know. Lastly, the cinematography in this film is also remarkably stunning. The camera pans close to the face of each character whenever they sing to show you what they are feeling in that moment. The film is also able to warp you back to the 1800's and make you believe that you are in France during that time period due to excellent production values and this is not surprising considering the amount of money having been spent to produce the film.Tom Hooper the director has created an astonishing masterpiece which must be seen by the most casual of film fans. If you do not like musicals, wait until you see this one!!!!",10,7,11,25 January 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," A Crazy Crazy Ride!
","All I can say after watching this film is that I have a headache. I mean that in the best possible way. So much is going on in this film at once, that some people would find to be too extreme and OTT. This film may seem superficial on the face of it, but what I found was a great depiction of capitalism gone wrong.The frenetic pace of the film may be too much for people to handle but it is what makes the film so entertaining. This is simply one of the most entertaining films to come out in the past decade in my opinion.Di Caprio is incredible as always but also surprised me in the lengths he went to portray Jordan as the greedy individual he was. Jonah Hill was also a great surprise for me as were the other supporting cast.This was a hell of a ride and should be seen. I don't know whether I would rank it as highly as Goodfellas but it is one of Scorcese's best.I have to say, however, that the film was about 30 mins longer than it should have been. But the film does a great job of entertaining you all the way through.This is a truly incredible achievement by Scorcese and lived up to all the expectations I had.",10,1,4,31 January 2014
