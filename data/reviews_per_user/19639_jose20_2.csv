Ali," Not bad, but not as good as 'When we were Kings'
","Ok, this movie is not altogether bad.. but do yourself a favor and go rent 'When we were Kings' . Much better in every single respect. Perhaps you shouldn't compare apples & oranges (one being  a work of fiction based on reality and the other a documentary), but on cinematic experience, side by side, WWWK is just no match for 'Ali'",5,0,0,5 August 2002
Pi," Excellent Effort
","Excellent effort --number theory in a movie that predates beautiful mind. Some people may say this movie is silly, or that the theories it portrays are explained incorrectly. I'd like to see them try to film a mathematical thriller. For me, it's Matrix (with more art) and Beautiful Mind (less apologetic, touchy-feely romance). Yes, the end is a bit of a let-down; and yes, the mathematical concepts are flashed real quickly in front of your eyes so you won't see the contradictions. But it's entertaining and original.",8,0,1,10 February 2003
