Kill Bill: Vol. 2," American chewing-gum for adults goes double
","It's a trashy movie done for entertainment. Well, if you find wasting the time of your life entertaining - you are welcome to the universe of the mighty Quentino Tarantino. Big-name actors, outstanding fight sequences, and impressive storytelling - it all cries out 'We are going for gold!' Some western characters are trying to show off as if they were Bruce Lees, Sonny Chibas or Jackie Chans. One matter makes me real uneasy: this piece dealing with second-hand trifle things, which we saw before in other movies, occupies a place of honour on IMDb top 250 list. And note that poor wire stunt on the railing (when the Japanese guy flew horizontally around the main heroine during combat) - that looked so amateurish and goofy. And if you notice that the snowfall is fake and consists of torn paper... Better watch 'Smeshariki' or 'Luntik' instead. Japanese actors should be ashamed to take part in this western action flick of the 'glorious master'.What about very original and entertaining 'Police Story', 'Once Upon a Time in China', 'City Hunter', 'Armour of God', and quite a number of other genuine titles? They are outsiders. Hopefully, the situation will change and the real classics will finally oust the box-office modern 'McDonald's' gems from the top list.And if you recall such titles as 'Snow Blood' and 'Battle Royal' this 'Kill Bill' will really shrink to something like a wet and dirty toilet paper roll.It has zero value, though it tries so hard to be so special, - 1 point out of 10. Thanks for attention.",1,2,5,25 January 2007
Come and See," 'The soundtrack is boring'
","To write a simple review seems to be an easy task. Let's complicate the matters a bit. If You have time and inclination, perceive my point and method of commenting this particular movie. All right, here we go. What do we have on the negative side? The following lines are taken out from the IMDb reviews.1 'The soundtrack is boring, without any decent music at all... Indeed, this is not a realistic film in any way, shape or form... Its propaganda, devoid of any artistic merit. I give it the minimum score because of its extreme pro-Soviet bias, which makes the film offensive and indeed Soviet propaganda'. (by Jose Cruz)2 'And I love films, but really films are supposed to be entertaining. Or shocking. Or thought provoking. This is so tedious it feels like the director is calling the viewers bluff'. (by robc-26 from United Kingdom)3 'A war movie should educate the viewer in any of a number of ways. We should appreciate courage and sacrifice, we should empathise with the cold, hungry and terrified. We should be told about historical events and their impact on the final outcome'. (by Reebox from United Kingdom)4 'Lack of dialogue and explanation means that much of the time you don't know who people are or where they're going or what they hope to accomplish when they get there'. (by hanfuzzy from Barrie, Ontario, Canada)5 'The character of the boy doesn't seem developed enough and the imagery presented in some so-called 'intense' scenes did not truly attract my attention nor made me empathize with the character'. (by dubbs37 from United States)6 'Bad lead character development'. (by entej from Russian Federation)7 'The film is very slow and at many times throughout, nothing much is happening... The long, ringing in your ears, muted sound is off putting and not effective'. (by richard6 from United Kingdom)8 'I wanted to see more actual fighting, and how the war was perceived by soldiers not a 12 year old boy...' (by Steve Johnson (twiglet-1))9 'The Nazis was professional killers, OK, but they were yet civilized (if I could say so) beside of a savage hypocrite murders called russians with their red army!.. Nazis were stupid kids beside Red Holocaust and Stalin. Be serious!!!!!' (by nazratst from Romania)10 'The infamous village massacre happens in the last fifteen to twenty minutes of the film, and the German soldiers look so ridiculously evil and cartoon-like that it's very hard for this scene to have any particular interest or emotion. To be honest, I was so bored up to this point that the barbaric events unfolding on screen before me were almost welcoming as at least something was finally happening'. (by JSwallowX1 from Ireland)So, we can sum it all up in the lines below (adding some groovy spice will also help).Being a piece of blunt Soviet propaganda, the film is devoid of any historical accuracy and artistic merit. It's dull and tedious with an uninteresting main character (who has absolutely no background and is free from any development – either physical or mental). Who cares about some kid during the war times? Give us a HERO, not a whimpering child! This 'war' flick is neither entertaining nor serious. Its fictional happenings (women and children burnt in the barns by the Nazis? come on, in reality it was vice versa! read the historical documents!) pump up to the levels of 'Star Wars' with one serious difference: 'Star Wars' was at least thought-provoking and shocking. There is no decent music in the movie at all and the whole soundtrack cries out to get turned off. The last straw that could break any camel's back (i.e. insult any viewer's ears) was some cheap melody at the end of the flick. The whole movie is boring to such degree that any normal human being will yawn and fall asleep during the initial 10 minutes. If you want to see a real feat for the eyes and ears, watch the documentary 'Der Ewige Jude', which IS a masterpiece at all levels and on top of everything has realistic cow scenes (unlike this one). Watch any USA picture with the WWII topic – they are not many, but at least they represent the historical facts and show us WHO won the World War II and at WHAT unspeakable price... The Russians exaggerate things immensely, making the events going on on their territory look like some kind of annihilation. Nonsense. The Germans were never cruel during the WWII on the USSR territory and they always behaved in a most decent manner. It was Russian troops who were deranged killers (there is even a historically accurate photo of a Russian soldier bullying a poor German woman and robbing her of her bicycle! and it happened in the streets of Berlin when the war was over! Check out the I-net archive footage if you don't believe! just imagine WHAT was happening during the war days!). The verdict: if you are a sane civilized and thinking European, stay far away from this schmoopy fantasy.Do You agree? What do You know about the WWII? How empty is Your vision? To which extent are Your brains brainwashed and 'freed'?Any further comment is superfluous. Actually, this movie does not need any review or comment. But our today's way of life needs it badly. And today's cinema.Thank you for attention.",10,22,32,5 June 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A whimsical UFO softie is the best friend for an American boy
","This movie is a turkey for a number of reasons.Reason No.1 Alien topic is not a childish one. Here the movie is a piece of supposed family-oriented entertainment, a kind of 'soft' sci-fi, which in most cases sucks. For children this piece of entertainment is harmful (it makes kids believe in a kind E.T. and other scum), while for grown-ups this film is simply flat.Reason No.2 This movie did not make me laugh or smile, did not make me fear or think, did not entertain me - it just dragged on for an hour and a half. Could not believe my eyes and ears later on when famous men were expressing their adoration before this flick and considered it to be the best of the best.Reason No.3 The idea of friendship between a child and an alien can be quite well executed but in this movie it just does not work. The extraterrestrial looks stupid and goofy while the child is a run-of-the-mill boy. There is no chemistry to amaze. A helpless wretched alien, who 'lost' his parents? Fie! Come on, give me 'Predator' to enjoy.Reason No.4 Lack of interesting fresh ideas. Oh, yes, there is a bicycle flying against the dark sky with moon as a background. It's still being remade and remixed here and there on TV. Big ...deal.There is a very low-end and cheap British movie 'Xtro', which is superior in each and every point mentioned above. The child who played Tony there was to be nominated for an Oscar, the aliens were real bad, and the chemistry between the child and his 'altered' father was grotesque.Agree or not, but 'E.T.' is too soft and too boring, in my humble opinion.While there still should be something good about this movie, which slips my mind, here go a few points to be more objective.Verdict: a very soft pathetic American sc-fi of '3 out of 10' kind. Thanks for attention.",3,9,18,6 March 2007
Chinatown," A thriller-flopperoo
","My opinion is that Mr Roman Polanski is one of the most prominent directors of our time. But 'Chinatown' is a flop.One day when it was shown over our local TV I tried hardly to enjoy it, but I could not. The same happened, when I watched 'The Ninth Gate'. I cannot mention a single thing, which I like about the movie. The movie just goes on and on and on, as if the director has nothing to say. As to me, I have certainly nothing good to say. I agree that it is a dark psychological drama but this film being on the top list is not right.It is also an unpleasant movie (not ultimately though). There exist much worse movies and that's why.. . I give it a weak 3 out of 10, sorry, Mr Roman Polanski. Thanks for attention.",3,9,32,12 May 2008
Se7en," 'Se7en' out of 10?
","Not on my scale. I choose '1' as a mark for this one. Why? Because it's sick and perverted, neither entertaining nor clever, neither beautiful nor comfortably ugly. Just oppressive. It's got very unpleasant atmosphere and imagery. Who are these movies made for? They are disgusting. When you watch this you feel as if you were bathing in manure. Is it supposed to be the development of cinema and taste of the audience since Chaplin movies? I'd rather keep with the old Chaplin ones.One disgusting occurrence goes into another, then - another, and so on until the list of the deadly sins is over. This flick deserves to be a piece of entertainment for bored hit men, who can later discuss 'the head in the box' with their buddies (remember 'Max Payne'?).If a movie is artistically weak and leaves an empty feeling - all because of some fiction created by somebody, what's the purpose of it all? I should also mention that many years ago I considered this movie to be wise. And of course I wouldn't bother to write a review, but, damn, it's on the top 250 list, which is depressing.Watch our 'Stalker', 'Ostrov', or 'Solyaris' if you want a clever film dealing with sins. That's all I've got to say.1 out of 10. Thanks for attention.",1,14,33,12 May 2008
Batman Returns," Unlike other follow-ups of the saga this one is artistically and atmospherically superb
","What I extremely like about 'Batman' (1989) bounces back again in 'Batman Returns': schizophrenic characters (in 'Batman' there were at least two super-schizophrenics - I shouldn't name them, should I? - but here there are distinctive three of them), enchanting atmosphere (the sets are beautiful, 'gothically' menacing, and simply outstanding), cool acting (when I say 'cool acting' I mean my absolute inability to poke finger at the characters with disrespect and contempt; quite the other way round: I do respect all the characters here, while they are never goofy, stupid, or over-sentimental), great action scenes (fighting against the hordes of clowns, great acrobatic stunts - I am especially happy with that scene where clowns are jumping onto the Xmas tree and bring havoc to the streets of Gotham, effective explosions, insane killing sprees, etc.), sharp black humour which reminds me of 'Hamlet' (remember the trio wild chemistry?), fine music (it is far from being some monotonous junk or over-imposed opera pieces) and tons of other minor 'Easter eggs'.By the way, I had a chance to watch 'Batman Begins' one day - is it supposed to be good? No way, it is clumsy. They ruined the whole concept one more time. Why do people go for those 'zero copies'? Wasn't 'Batman and Robin' enough? I respect Mr Tim Burton for quitting the 'Batman' project after this film. He's done more than enough for making the figure of on-screen Batman legendary. And when you think about comics as the source for the movie, you get the idea: this film is a damn impressive achievement.10 out of 10 - it is as good as the original. Thank you for attention.",10,6,12,5 February 2008
The Terminator," Do we really have to take this 'Emmanuelle' crap in order to know?
","A good and reliable film. Without children-oriented atmosphere of its sequel and without CGI-oriented smell of its blockbuster let's-have-some-fun sequel's sequel. Have seen it quite a number of times during these 15 years and it still does not wear out.The vocabulary of the cyborg is very curt and mature. So is the movie. The effects are restrained but notably to the point. The dark atmosphere is superb. The shootout in the police department is not bad at all. It is a real highlight.Bad thing is a sex scene. Do we really have to take this 'Emmanuelle' crap in order to know that this soldier is the father of the future John? It should have been moved to the deleted scenes (can't help mentioning 'First Blood' as a pure example of a very clever move in a similar case). Absence of this (as well as some verbal hints) would have added more mystery (like 'Is that man the father of John Connor or not?'). A pair of additional bloody fist fights or shoot-out scenes instead would have been quite nice though.Still, cannot give it a lower mark - it is a very rare example of tough revolutionary cinema. Thank you for attention.",10,1,2,25 April 2006
Alien," Finally in my DVD collection with tons of cute extras
","There are not so many movies, which I'm craving to have in my DVD collection, but 'Alien' is definitely one of them. It is grim and tough, it is dark and surreal, it is violent and freaky, it is thought-provoking and mesmerizing. You can try to make fun of it, but you cannot hurt its reputation of a solid sci-fi, because there are so few movies of this calibre. Like in case with 'Terminator' I do not like the following 'part': 'Aliens' and 'Terminator 2' turned the initial concepts into 'shoot-'em-all' parody.Atmosphere of loneliness and constant danger is created and being kept up all through the movie. One wrong actor could have ruined it all but the director made the right choice. Every actor is in its place and performs very well.I agree with those IMDb reviewers who mention that 'Aliens' destroyed the original concept. Damn right. 'Alien', as I see it, was never about a war of marines vs. hordes of ETs. 'Alien' was about our fears and loneliness, about such moments in our life when no living man, even with a big plasma rifle or whatever, can help you, and you have to fight for yourself.I'm very grateful to our DVD market that it lets us buy 'Alien' movies separately. I would never buy the 'Alien quadrology', because the quality of all the parts is extremely different.10 out of 10 - triumph of sci-fi genre. Thank you for attention.",10,0,1,27 December 2007
Battleship Potemkin," Bronetyomkin Ponosets
","Its bumping propaganda makes it a pitiful work of art and a viewer - sick (it has so much negative information that you may go puking). Though of course it is an interesting film because it lets us soak up the atmosphere of those times: mass hysteria and blasphemy. It is like a poster arranged by Vladimir Mayakovsky, only in black and white (with a bit of red). It's valuable as a vivid distorted history lesson. The musical score is far from being impressive but matches the style of the film perfectly.5 out of 10, groundbreaking in its propaganda and at the same time miserable, but letting 'Pet Shop Boys' spoiling the picture is not right - they should have accompanied 'The Godfather' instead ('Go West', you know). Thanks for attention.",5,6,12,11 April 2006
Full Metal Jacket," Twisted irony, acid mockery, and 'in-your-face' performance
","Finally I see a movie by Mr Stanley Kubrick that is up to my expectations. A solid war film full of twisted irony, acid mockery, and 'in-your-face' performance of all the actors involved. Though I wish I did not read the trivia, because reading that the movie was filmed in the UK with the plastic palm trees does not add any respect to the production (I think I should quit the trivia for certain great films – it simply ruins the whole impression sometimes). Still, even without that kind of authenticity the movie walks along quite well. Its ridiculous amount of fowl language is justified (just think how many movies nowadays are crammed with bad language which is there just because the director thinks it's cool no matter if it fits the film itself or not). You don't expect the military guys saying something like 'Would you be so kind to run faster, Private Vincent D'Onofrio', do you? The performance of Mr R. Lee Ermey deserves an Oscar without any doubt. However offensive his character is, you feel that he is making his job the best he can. His one-liners are something to hear. Sometimes you don't know: to laugh or cry.I cannot help pointing out that remarkable music during the tense psychological scenes (beating of Pvt Pyle and Pvt Pyle 's pay-back). Those scenes stand out and overshadow the war scenes.A great movie worth viewing. Definitely not for children. It's an example of film-making when any remake will not be up to the original. And I don't understand when spoof-productions of such war classics appear. I don't think that certain subjects can be made fun of.It's a 9 out of 10 from me. Thank you for attention.",9,0,0,12 November 2009
Predator," Better memories from my childhood
","We had once a black-and-white TV-set at home, which used to 'fade away' when showing something interesting. It was the case when they transmitted 'Predator' back in 1988-1991 (don't remember the year exactly). The image became weaker and very soon the signal was lost. It was lost completely during the 'helicopter' scene. Deep frustration it was. Then, years later, it was possible to get a VHS on the local markets. But that was not enough, of course. Now we have a DVD release. No extras - just the movie itself (like 'Commando'). Quite happy with that.'Knock, knock!' and 'Stick around' are charmingly cruel jokes delivered by you-know-who in a usual easy-going manner. All the characters in the movie are real tough. They look tough, they talk tough, and they can kill all right. There is no stupid 'love story' attached. The only detail, which is not very true to life, is the way the Russian men are shown. If the Russian men had dusted at least one or two persons from Dutch's team  it would have been more believable (as well as Dutch's death at the end). But that is a matter of personal preference In 'First Blood' also would like to see Rambo die (not because dislike him  consider it would have been more tragic and cool).The design of the title monster is quite good. The 'little painless' is superb. The choice of the actors surpasses any expectations. The music is very to the point  in a movie like this it is just priceless (it seems to be in 'jungle' trend). All in all this movie is of the highest class and can kick the hell out of nearly any action/horror of today's cinema. The second part doesn't get close to the original  it never had a chance. It could not have reached the heights of 'Predator', even if the big Dutch would have been there.After numerous watching still cannot see any interfering drawbacks.It is a definite 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.",10,12,14,12 September 2006
"I, Robot"," Why I consider it to be a poor sci-fi?
","1) The main character performed by Mr Will Smith is pathetic. He is like a run-of-the-mill hero of the day: cocky, chatty, self-confident, and invulnerable. He is black too, but it's not a problem (of course). Suppose, the problem is that the actor has the qualities of a comedian. I would prefer a serious brooder. Comedy elements often destroy sci-fi. Here it's a perfect example.2) The dialogues are too numerous and too shallow. The humans chat a lot and the robots chat a lot. And when you hear much of that during a sci-fi, you get annoyed and distracted from the main ideas. There are also some stupid phrases (they were pushed into the movie for a more 'teenager feel' maybe?), like the one pronounce by a boy from the rebelling crowd, when he sees how cool the woman is.3) The action scenes are laughable. Not because they are done poorly, but because they make the whole film look like a fantasy. Hundreds of tough robots collide with the crowd of men and it looks that the men are fighting off all right. And the main character is jumping about in slow-mo, waving his gun about and taking out targets while he's in the air. It should look cool if you are watching a mindless action, but here, with some serious topics as the background, it turns into a charade.4) The design of robots is not to my taste. I don't like it. They look goofy like cartoon characters from a 'Pixar'/'Disney' production.All these things have such an awkward impression, that I don't even want to think about the plot, however brilliant it should be.The final lines: it is a shiny Hollywood production for having fun on a Sunday afternoon, if your fun supposes watching movies like 'Independence Day' or 'Demolition Man'. You watch, you go 'Wow!' and you forget all this crap in a couple of hours never to watch it again. I really expected this movie to be from a different category (even with such an actor as Mr Will Smith). It reminds me of 'Bee Movie'. And that's not just a bad sign - that's a horrible sign. Whenever I experience such ambitious productions in the genre of sci-fi, my mood gets spoilt for quite a time. Sorry, but this flick has no chances against, for instance, 'Cyborg' (a sci-fi with a very low rating on IMDb and without any CGI at all). And if I mention 'Blade Runner' or 'Alien' A 3 out of 10. Thank you for attention.",3,3,5,5 September 2008
Apocalypse Now," Redux cut: tragically poetic and poetically tragic, but with flaws
","Being rather messy, it is a very good war film with lots of surreal twists and memorable characters. The helicopters attack scene is definitely one of the finest with a very proper soundtrack as a background.It is a USA film devoid of patriotism. At certain points of the film the long running time of the redux version is a torture because it contains two embarrassing episodes: the one with the 'Playboy' girls and the other – with the veiled smoking-sex scene in the French camp (?). More tough and mindless action scenes would be more suitable than these prolonged kiss-and-hug mishmash.The main spoilers of this message are the following hints on how to make the best of 'Apocalypse Now' viewing. Suppose that the movie should be a grand voyage with a glass of vodka consumed just before the opening scene. The TV colours are to be tuned to the maximum. The home phone must be unplugged, the mobile one - switched off, the door bell – disconnected. The windows - properly shut to keep all the street noises outside. And skip the two scenes mentioned above.The abominable and suicidal redux cut of this 'death card' movie still deserves a reliable 8 out of 10. Thanks for attention.",8,1,2,19 September 2005
Aliens," Mr Lance Henriksen pulls it to a more decent level
","The second installation, though miles better than the follow-ups, is nowhere near the original movie. I got the DVD for my collection only because of Mr Lance Henriksen. This actor is terrific in the role of Bishop. Everybody else in this movie is so-so. Hollywood makes a simple shoot-'em-all action out of a freaking sci-fi concept. We have too little left to our imagination. The aliens are not so frightening any more. I'm sure it is a solemn result of Mr Giger's absence and the absence of Mr Ridley Scott. These two guys should have done it in a much more depressing manner. 'Aliens' should have been depressing and shocking to the core.How would I improve the production? I would: 1. diminish chat-chat jokes of the marines considerably (come on, it's no 'Renegade Justice'); 2. not include aliens 'crowd scenes' (many creatures don't necessarily mean more fear); 3. by no means show the scene with the queen laying eggs and a hundred of aliens running about (the viewer has been robbed and treated as a low-grade loser who has no imagination); 4. keep a few shouts away from the final product (cf. the one in the beginning when the astronaut is shown with a face-hugger attached to him and the kids start to yell); 5. make a more complex script with fewer real people and more androids to face aliens (sending a bunch of flesh-and-blood marines to fight the unknown beasts looks a bit lame and scientifically not justified).Bishop saves the production. Otherwise it would have turned into a cheap popcorn flick. Well, yes, it's damn near that category but Mr Lance Henriksen pulls it to a more decent level. You are the Man.7 out of 10. Thanks for attention.",7,0,3,17 June 2008
Underground," Not to everybody's liking
","The movie is rather dark in mood and technically.Tragedy and comedy are linked together in a furious mixture accompanied by loud memorable music and songs. The surreal situations make this film a parable. In my humble opinion, it is the finest achievement of Mr Emir Kusturica. The movie has such an irresistible Slavic feel to it, that only a very limited number of viewers seem to be able to appreciate its charm. Not to everybody's liking. It's no 'Matrix', no 'Godfather', no 'Pulp Fiction' and it's no 'Fellowship of the Ring' or 'Star Wars'. 'Underground' stares at humanity with a grin. A mirror where we all can see the reflection of our past, present, and future. We know what a war is, but we cannot stop. It's a story without end. Three hours fly by in a blur.Some scenes have become classic for me: a monkey in a tank, the heroes with guns in a boat with the orange sunshine upon their faces, underwater characters, theatrical play with some crazy outspoken expressions and jests, the head-butted UN soldier (who started some brainwashing conversation and got served), the running Petar 'Crni' with a rifle shooting at a UN (?) helicopter, the 'flying' bride, the final gathering (which takes place in some meta-world, like the final scene in 'Solyaris').In a few words: it is a funny movie, which is at the same time very horrific.Excellent, 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.",10,6,10,10 May 2006
Batman Begins," But what three!
","While I enjoy Tim Burton 'Batman' immensely, I cannot stand this one. What are the problems with 'Batman Begins'? Well, I can name at least three ones. But what three!Reality. How come they put Gotham City into the real world together with Rome and other true-to-life cities? It is simply laughable. In the Burton movie Gotham is such an amazing ethereal place that it just frees your mind. And here we have a dirty town next to New York or whatever.Background. In certain amounts the background is great. But when everything gets explained, stretched out, chewed and re-chewed with a detailed psychological analysis of the characters... it gets boring and nauseating. In 'Batman' (1989) we had two psychos. They just clashed and the whole Gotham was a battlefield for the two maniacs who did not have to back themselves up with the loads of facts from their lives - they were too stylish for that paraphernalia and too insane. And what do we have here? Numerous flashbacks which are annoying. The main character's idiotic samurai-like training as if he were going to become a Jedi knight from 'Star Wars' trilogy (and there is also that actor who performed in 'Star Wars: Episode 1'). Scrutinized explanation of the technology performed by Mr Morgan Freeman and of the way it can be purchased. Deep speeches delivered by the evil and good guys that resemble the notorious rubbish talks from 'Matrix: Reloaded'.Actors with profound performance. What the hell is wrong with the performance? It's too self-imposing. I feel as if these actors are going to burst from inside  their self-importance is simply overwhelming. I feel the need to shout at the TV-set: 'Come on guys! It's 'Batman', not 'Born on the Forth of July'!' Those serious talks and big serious faces resemble scenes from 'Godfather'. Fine, they are making a deep criminal saga out of a comics booklet. Just brilliant.That's enough to lower the mark to a 3-out-of-10 level. The conception has been ruined. It's no match for the 'Batman' from the 1989. By the way, I tried to watch this movie twice. For me to watch it from top to toe was unbearable.My verdict: unwatchable for the most part of its running time, but at least not completely tasteless and repellent (its major achievement). 3 out of 10. I would never bother commenting this one but it's on the top list while 'Batman' (1989) is not. I cannot take this for granted. Thanks for attention.",3,2,3,28 August 2008
Dumb and Dumber," It is almost impossible to overdo what is done here
","The movie is unsuitable for clever and serious men and women because it is devoid of philosophical content and any deep thoughts. What is worse, the movie is totally devoid of sophisticated special effects and it is a very rapid example of cinema making (the movie has no intermissions when a viewer can think of his own problems). Where is a slow-paced movie with two-three jokes being prolonged and mixed with clever dialogues and fierce gun plays? Where are remarks dedicated to the meaning of life? Where is the perfect English speech? It is only a start of fault-finding.This movie must be re-cut in order to delete all the terrifying scenes (heart tearing, worms breeding, beating of a woman in snowy surroundings, tongue torture, bottle pissing, toilet destruction, spitting into food, rejecting beautiful girls in the end, etc.). 'Dumb and Dumber' is completely inappropriate for our modern high-tech community. Its full version must be banned in all countries and all DVDs with it must be demolished. Hate this movie because...In other words, it is a classic comedy stuffed with some unique gags, grimaces, and dialogues. Do not miss this one if you can endure a few crude jokes, which are quite harmless by today's standards.This disastrous piece of 'art' must be given, without any mercy, a 10 mark (excellence). Thanks for attention.",10,0,1,19 September 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," American chewing-gum for adults
","It's a trashy movie done for entertainment. Well, if you find wasting the time of your life entertaining - you are welcome to the universe of the mighty Quentino Tarantino. Big-name actors, outstanding fight sequences, and impressive storytelling - it all cries out 'We are going for gold!' Some western characters are trying to show off as if they were Bruce Lees, Sonny Chibas or Jackie Chans. One matter makes me real uneasy: this piece dealing with second-hand trifle things, which we saw before in other movies, occupies a place of honour on IMDb top 250 list. And note that poor wire stunt on the railing (when the Japanese guy flew horizontally around the main heroine during combat) - that looked so amateurish and goofy. And if you notice that the snowfall is fake and consists of torn paper... Better watch 'Smeshariki' or 'Luntik' instead. Japanese actors should be ashamed to take part in this western action flick of the 'glorious master'.What about very original and entertaining 'Police Story', 'Once Upon a Time in China', 'City Hunter', 'Armour of God', and quite a number of other genuine titles? They are outsiders. Hopefully, the situation will change and the real classics will finally oust the box-office modern 'McDonald's' gems from the top list.And if you recall such titles as 'Snow Blood' and 'Battle Royal' this 'Kill Bill' will really shrink to something like a wet and dirty toilet paper roll.It has zero value, though it tries so hard to be so special, - 1 point out of 10.

2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001 is history already
","This movie is 50/50 to my liking. If I skip certain pieces, it will be great (I am not speaking about the running time of the film - no problem with lasting movies). If I watch it all, it is far from being one of the top movies ever. To put it simple: there are good and bad things in this sci-fi.Good things. Slow pace with clear images of space, spaceships, and fine interiors. A powerful machine-vs.-man duel. A bizarre ending, visually very well executed.Bad things. Apes' war at the beginning. The apes are quite to the point in 'Planet of the Apes' but here it looks like a BBC wildlife production. Besides, the whole evolution representation is like a boring school film on history of mankind. A purely scientific approach to Man. The characters here look like empty shells. Where are souls? It is almost impossible to feel any compassion to these 'scientific shadows of man'. I don't give a damn if all the human characters die in the end. A kind of background Soviet/American rat race, which had been gone quite a time before the real 2001 ('Aeroflot' logos look out of place here). Triumphant music, that adds some cheap exclamation mark to the production. I have to jump from my seat to get the volume down - what the hell is that? I am not sleeping. To make an impression on the viewer it is not a must for an artist to yell his head off.Of course, in this one, Mr Stanley Kubrick does not fall as flat as in 'A Clockwork Orange' (which is, whatever praise, disgusting), but still, I had expected much more from a top 250 representative before viewing. After watching these two movies, I put off 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'Lolita' for good, while I suppose, they are also of this 'good hits and awkward misses' nature. Perhaps, 'A.I.' would have been a solid one from head to foot, but it is only 'dedicated to...'. A fine for 'awkward misses' maybe.Our 'Solyaris' is the indisputable winner in this competition and that's marvellous.5 out of 10. Thank you for attention.",5,1,4,24 August 2007
Total Recall," One of the weakest sugar-coated sci-fi attempts from Hollywood
","'Predator' and 'Terminator' are good. 'Commando' is funny and cool. 'RoboCop' is great. But this one is a turkey, neither cool nor funny, neither good nor ultimately bad. It pretends to be something valuable. But such elements as the fighting between the main hero and his 'wife' with 'picturesque' martial arts moves, stupid taxi service with that cheap talking driver-doll that tries to joke, bits of action without proper 'set piece' as a big macho is running, jumping, and killing some mutants and security guards, while trying to save the planet (is it a video-game? then where is the joystick?), pretentious performance and dialogues backed up by violence (remember the evil character shooting a lady in the bar just to show them who's the boss and his face expressions), too many trash-talking characters - especially mutants - making it all look hectic like some crowd scenes of 'Star Wars' are ruining it, at least to me. Even a greatly executed (visually) scene with the talking female cyber-mask, which blows the whole place off, cannot save it all. When I witness such things, I am not interested in the plot. It is just another eye-candy from Hollywood - it can be mind-blowing (and perhaps it really is) but I don't care what happens next. If you can appreciate all those super-entertaining details, then it is possibly a movie for you. I cannot. 'What a waste of everything' is the only phrase that comes to my mind.Just one parallel to mention here. Does anybody remember the PD shoot-out scene in 'Terminator' or any shooting scene in 'RoboCop'? The backgrounds for those scenes were overwhelming. The shootouts looked real and serious. They were kind of 'fortissimo'. And even after repeated viewing I watch them with some sort of awe. And what do we have here? It all looks like a cheap 'catch-me-if-you-can' game that just goes on and on till the finale. Cannot call any separate action scene even 'mezzo-forte'.Maybe I'm completely wrong and it is just the choice of effects, actors, and one-liners, which are to blame.Anyhow, I do not want to recall this 'Total Recall' because it does not worth it. The only reason I type this comment is that I disagree with the film's high rating. It is to be 5 out of 10 at most. 'RoboCop' (1987) is worth a thousandth buy (great job, Mr Paul Verhoeven) while 'Total Recall' is not worth even a second look (can't believe it is the same Mr Paul Verhoeven behind this production).3 out of 10 (to watch once is more than enough). Thanks for attention.",3,22,52,14 August 2007
The Matrix Reloaded," My personal system error
","To start with, feel very ashamed that have bought the special DVD edition of this movie, money gone a very wrong way. In the store it looked so great with so much extra material. But the brothers had made a big mistake by arranging it all. Yes, they surely did make money on this, but they ruined the atmosphere of the original 'Matrix' for me. The original 'Matrix' was original indeed with a good beginning and with a perfect ending. At the end we had 'system error'. One of the best final scenes ever. It was so clever of me to go for the sequel. And here is our champion - ' The Matrix Reloa', - no, sorry, - 'Matrix: Retarded'.IMDb is responsible for my failure to some extent, because it doesn't show 'comedy' in the genre section. It is a comedy, to be sure.The reloaded film is full of importance to the very core: vast amount of new heroes (including Roy Jones), philosophic dialogues that make it all look like adult shampoo, indecent sex scene that goes at the same time of the indecent rave-like party, super showing-off by nearly everybody on the screen (something like 'look at me, I am so tough in sun glasses'), etc. Would even pay some dough for just having a chance to absolutely forget about this naughty experience (IMAX experience, as they put it). Very bad sequel. It can be better, though. If one cuts out all the scenes and phrases that ruin the atmosphere of the original movie (how about that rubbish saying 'He's doing the Superman thing'?), we'll get a rather good sequel. It should finish with the incoming robots and Morpheus saying some apocalyptic lines ('to be concluded' must be extracted of course).The verdict: will keep it in my collection as a pure example of senseless Hollywood sequels. After this sequel don't even think to watch 'revolutions'. Don't you have enough of 'reloaded' stuff? The bonus DVD is packed full with commercials and some mocking crazy stuff - 'MTV award' short movie about two dudes travelling in 'Matrix' reality, who do not have the slightest respect for the movie (in such circumstances - totally agreed).A couple of points are more than enough for this abomination (at least the CGI department did some job). Thanks for attention.",2,0,1,25 April 2006
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Not bad at all
","Perfectly filmed action scenes. Tough realistic story of brotherhood. A history lesson for many of us. The filmmakers did make a very personal film.'Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo' has several intense war scenes (perfect cinematography) which just go on and on. They leave bloody under-taste in your mouth. No stupid intermissions, no mumble talks, no background humour - only blood, gore, pain, and broken lives.Some say that the main characters are kept alive in an unnatural manner. Well, war is also unnatural and some fantastic things happen (during the bloody wars in the 20th century quite a lot of unbelievable but true stories of survival took place). As to the gay topic - come on, it is ridiculous. How can such thoughts strike a viewers mind? When a boy buys his younger brother an ice-cream - is it supposed to be gay-like behaviour? One should refer to 'Brokeback Mountain' for such topics.There were no tears in my eyes at the end of the movie but it did leave solid and strong impression.One of the war masterpieces - 10 out of 10 (deep respect to Korea). Thank you for attention.",10,5,7,7 April 2006
Ben-Hur," One of the very best religious movies
","To start with, the tagline 'The World's Most Honored Motion Picture' is a very bold statement but it can be considered correct. To touch upon religious subjects and to keep oneself out of pile of dung is a very hard task. If a director lets himself some liberties (even tiny) - there he is, i.e. in a pile of manure up to his neck or even deeper.Here the film-makers arranged everything in a very cautious and decent way. The Saviour is present in every frame but at the same time is not openly shown on celluloid. We can feel it. Great stuff. This alone makes me give this movie the highest mark. One of the finest achievements in cinematography.10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.",10,2,5,12 April 2006
The Matrix," Shadowed in a very bad way
","The only thing that spoiled this movie was its sequels. They cast such an abominable shadow upon the original film that one just cannot give 'The Matrix' the highest mark. If they were shot by different persons, with different cast, etc. it could have been neglected. Alas, the same persons are doing it in. That is why 'The Lawnmower Man' is better and deserves a definite 10 out of 10.If you want to see how a brilliant movie can be destroyed by clumsy sequels - this is a sheer example.As to the movie itself, it is properly done and is captivating. In 'The Matrix' everything is slick...9 out of 10. Thank you for attention.",9,0,1,12 April 2006
Evil Dead II," An excellent midnight movie
","When Ash sits down and the chair falls apart. Damn, there was such situation in my own life once (before the class). The way he confidentially sits his ass down holding the shotgun in his hand and then - rattle-bang! - he's on the floor.The absence of immaculate computer special effects makes it only better. The leading actor can teach a lot of first-class actors how to perform with heart on screen. 'Who is laughing off top 250 now?!' This movie doesn't need any Oscars. It is just in the hearts of millions who saw it and evaluated its creativeness.Especially interesting is Ash's ability to solve a nearly impossible question without hesitation. When his hand is being possessed, he doesn't think, he doesn't cry his eyes out - he just saws it off. A real man. A real hero. And a real nut. Without muscles he can kick a zombie's butt just with the help of his incredible stamina.All the rest has been mentioned, and mentioned so many times.One of the best epic movies - 8 out of 10. Thank you for attention.",8,1,3,5 September 2006
