Conquest 1453," In the Turkish version the Nazis won
",Conquest 1453 is the first Turkish film I have ever seen so I really did not have any biases or expectations. I read older reviews and realized that is is a big mistake to compare it with 'Kingdom of Heaven' so I would like to compare it with Finnish production 'Iron Sky'. Very similar motivation to start a war (a leader long time ago hinted that lebensraum should be widened and property of others should be seized disregarding any right to it and brave soldiers shouting 'banzai' are charging without second opinion) just in the Turkish version the Nazis won. Loved the last shot - the sultan with a blond smiling baby. Just like Stalin's posters for the election day (do sultans get elected if he needs such a publicity stunt but cannot give a smallest peck on his own sons cheek?). For those who love the acting style of Venezuelan soap opera the film should really be a treat.,2,15,28,23 September 2012
