Whip It," Fun to make, mostly pleasant to watch
","It seemed that the cast was having a great time making this film, and I enjoyed it. The film recycled quite a number of themes from earlier films (otherwise known as clich√©s). A child entering a profession which a parent will find hateful? You can find a source as far back as silent film. Plus escape from a small town, disappointment in first love, losing local sports team turning things around.Maybe the novel made all of this fresh and vibrant. I don't care. I enjoyed watching this film, despite the lack of fresh insights or new situations.Ellen Page continues to delight. This performance is not much of a contrast from Juno, but I think: why shouldn't she do as many troubled/wacky juvenile roles while she still can? She can play Lady Macbeth later.Marcia Gay Harden seemed to be a bit over the top. She is an excellent actress, and I am afraid that the director's inexperience allowed her to settle for stereotype rather than the creation of an actual individual. She was good, but could have been so much better.Pash and Birdman were very pleasant and amiable, but never really became interesting. Oliver, the first love, was a total blank. No advance indication of his true feelings, and no later confirmation. So that swimming pool scene was not love, just foreplay? My opinion of Oliver is based upon what I have been told to believe, not on what I have seen.Coach Razor (Andrew Wilson) was fascinating. Here is a real person rather than a stereotype. What was his sexuality? Straight? Gay? Undecided? It doesn't matter at all to the plot, and my fascination is probably due to the lack of stereotype being used here.'Iron Maven,' the antagonist. I did not review the cast list prior to watching the film. During the course of the film, there was a reference to 'she-males' being the Derby stars. At a point in the film, I actually believed that 'Iron Maven' was a transsexual with perhaps a dubbed-in voice. Yikes! It's Juliette Lewis! Doing a fine job.And that's the irony of this film: the director, Drew Barrymore, started as a child actor and became a director with this film. Juliette Lewis (who has a monologue about age and accomplishments) also began when she was a child and her major accomplishments were a number of years ago. And the star is Ellen Page, whose current fame is her ability portray adolescence. Time, time, time, see what's become of me.This film will exit the theaters very soon. I think it will be a worthwhile rental, or PPV choice. It has its shortcomings, relying too frequently on stereotypes; but I liked it a lot, and maybe you will, too.",7,0,3,21 October 2009
Source Code," An amazingly good film, about hope
","There are so many lame-ass films out there, being made directly for cable. Or 'big' films being made in 3-D even though their plots and their merits are 'small.' They think that the special effects and the extra dimension might obscure the fact that no one would want to watch the film otherwise.I am not going to say anything at all about the plot of this film. I knew the set-up (I'd seen the trailers). And that's all you need to know if you haven't seen the film yet.After seeing the film, and then coming home and thinking about it all, there are obviously some major logical problems in the science behind this sci-fi. Could that actually happen? Probably not. But if that's going to kill your enjoyment of the film: tell me, where did Mary Poppins go when she floated up into the clouds? A UFO? Heaven? Neptune? The answer is totally irrelevant. If you are inclined to ask such questions, don't see the film.This film was so shockingly good, and literate. And human. This is probably the most human sci-fi film I've seen in years. It didn't rely on computers or visual tricks for its effect.What you take home with you after seeing the film will be a product of what you had in your heart before the film began. And after you see the film, is this more about love, or hope? (And the film clearly illustrates faith, hope and love, but it is not at all religious and you won't notice unless you are.) There are obvious parallels with earlier films, especially that absolutely terrific masterpiece Groundhog Day. But while I was watching the film, I was not focused on identifying the past similar themes.There is nothing in this film that would seem to pose a problem for home screening. No sex or rough language. No gore or graphic violence. I can't imagine a child under 12 years old being interested, but there's nothing here to warp their development. And I think this would also be a good 'date movie,' because a lot of it is a love story.Jake Gyllenhaal was nominated for an Oscar for Brokeback Mountain. Justly so, IMHO. But I thought that his performance here certainly equaled his earlier celebrated performance. Not a false note in this film, in which he is on screen for at least 90% of the time.I can't fault any of the acting. Amazingly good for a sci-fi film.I gave it a 9/10, because I've not yet totally concluded that something so unheralded and mainstream could be a masterpiece.This is a film as much about the heart as about the mind. Or scientific facts. I've often contemplated how the advent of cell phones has changed screenplay-writing, allowing the easier ability to call for help. This film integrates current known cell-phone technology seamlessly. And there is a cell-phone call here that is absolutely heartbreaking.I can't say more than 'see it.'",9,0,1,7 April 2011
Stop-Loss," Wish It Could Have Been Better
","Maybe the idea was to show the total hopelessness of the conflict--that it was not really a war but urban warfare, and that there is no way to win or to have a happy ending. But that's just an idea--it's not a movie.I thought that the set-up was fine. But I am not sure the filmmakers knew where to go with it. Their take on the stop-loss policy is obvious, and it is a message that should be heard. But I think the film would have been more interesting if any character exhibited any real growth during the film. The vets were all depicted as basket cases--the most well-adjusted vet seemed to be the double-amputee--he told us why he would want to go back to Iraq and there was at least some productive purpose that would have been served by his return there.Perhaps there are soldiers who don't mind being stop-lossed--who truly believe they are accomplishing something positive over there. It would have been refreshing to have a character like that--a non-basket case. It would have been good to hear arguments supporting the stop-loss program (if there are any).The last 20-30 minutes of this film were baffling. The end of the film (not an ending, just an end) was very unsatisfying.Ryan Philippe did a competent job, but rarely conveyed anything not apparent from the lines or situation. For example, you could see that a lot of his post-war angst was attributable to guilt. How that tied in with the ending is just a mystery to me.I recall that a very similar military policy was explored by Joseph Heller in Catch-22. I think a comparison to that novel and film is more apt than comparing this to The Deer Hunter.I wish this film could have been much better than it was.",7,28,44,8 April 2008
Friday Night Lights," Excellent retread
","(Spoilers ahead) Ironically, the spoiler is that the outcome of the big game is not what you would expect, and one of the major credits of this film is the unexpected but totally believable ending. I am so sick of manufactured plot twists that an unexpected but justified ending is especially satisfying.Notice that the reason the Mojo lost the game was a bad call which had nothing at all to do with their talents. The decisive point was a mistaken conclusion that the other team had accomplished something when in fact they had failed. Unrecognized failure in the other team was the reason for the loss--and everyone knew it.Some of the plot elements are familiar, such as the dutiful son sacrificing his future to take care of an ailing parent (I Never Sang For My Father is one example); and a son failing to live up to the expectations of a domineering father (The Great Santini comes to mind), and an adult who is trapped in his adolescence (Lifeguard, for instance). All of the themes were familiar, and possibly were done better in other movies. But regardless of the familiar territory, I can't deny that this film was powerful, exciting, and touching.I don't know the 'true' story, and can't comment on the film's fidelity to it. It seemed true to me, regardless of the actual facts, and that is what counts in a non-documentary.",7,0,1,13 October 2004
Fight Club," Difficult to Rate
","The film is very well made, with inventive directorial touches that actually help rather than hinder: such as the bit about adding subliminal porn, and the 180 degree quick pan, done vertically rather than horizontally.  In this 140 minute film, after the big plot twist occurs, there is not nearly enough remaining time to explore the resulting situation (but that would be a different movie).  The problem is that the film is unremittingly gruesome and at times, physically unpleasant.  I wouldn't want to watch this again, not because it is a bad film, but basically because I hated it.",5,0,2,30 April 2000
This Is the End," A devil put aside for me
","I thoroughly enjoyed the film, though in retrospect, I am not sure if it is really a great film--there's not much to compare it to. One thing's for certain: this film is not 'just like' any other film you could name. It is one of the funniest films I have seen in quite a while. And I am probably going to miss the Rapture as a result of my enjoyment.The film has graphic sex talk and graphic violence. The dialog could hardly be any nastier. And of course, hardly more sacrilegious. However, despite all of that, the film is surprisingly good-natured.This is not a film for children or for family viewing. Anyone who is squeamish or easily offended should stay away.And don't automatically assume that anyone over 40 would not like this film. I'm over 60; I had a great time. So I saw it a second time, and loved it even more.",9,438,751,12 June 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Amazing script, outstanding comedy
","The best thing about this movie (and there many great things) is the screenplay. Though I thought there were a few script problems toward the end, perhaps some shortcuts had to be made in order to keep the movie under two hours.The second scene between Jacob and Hannah is absolutely amazing, as Hannah unintentionally gives Jacob some important perspective on his life, and not by way of a lecture. For example, Hannah makes Jacob self-conscious about his appearance--compare that to a similar earlier scene. The Jacob/Hannah encounter is so well-written, so funny, and so well-acted, it's one reason I want to see the film again soon.Another instance of amazing screen writing is the scene which has Emily on the phone by the kitchen sink. The script furnishes an occasion for an actress to put so much across without really saying anything important, and Julianne Moore is terrific.Marisa Tomei is given the chance for a star turn, and does it perfectly.There are some flaws toward the end, and this is not a perfect film. But nearly so: extremely funny, well-written and well-acted.",9,3,6,4 August 2011
Troy," Myth understanding
","SPOILER, assuming you don't know who won the Trojan War.I haven't read The Iliad in decades, but wasn't Achilles invulnerable (like Superman), because as a baby he was dipped in the River Styx by his mother, except for one heel which she used to hold him? I am sure I am not making this up. So this means he would be incapable of being wounded (no lover would be able to cut his throat), and his mother would know about this quality. In this film, I am not sure anyone knew, or even if the invulnerability was a factor. The only blood I saw on Brad/Achilles was not his own.No scars visible on the 98% of Brad's body we were shown. But wasn't Achilles killed by a poison arrow? In the heel? Achilles without a heel is like Cyrano without a nose.It would have been interesting to explore the character of a brave warrior who knows he cannot be hurt. Is there any real bravery if you know you cannot be hurt? Patroclus stole Achilles' armor but could not steal Achilles' real protection. And how could Achilles hold Hector in such contempt if Achilles were indeed invulnerable, when Hector risked all and Achilles risked nothing?The movie played as though invulnerability was not a factor. Maybe the movie makers decided to scrap the myth. But if Achilles was not invulnerable, his survival of countless battles without a scratch is totally ludicrous.",7,0,1,19 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Much More Than Just Hype
","I wish very much that I had seen this film without knowing anything at all about it, and so my appreciation of it would not be colored by my expectations. I found the film to be a nice little film--entertaining, beautiful, extremely well-acted, and often very moving. But I don't think that it was intended by its director to be a trend-setter, or to make a statement, or to strike a blow for equality. And the fact that I could enjoy the film as a fascinating story, and at the end find it to be a 'nice little film,' rather than political statement, is a further testament to Ang Lee's artistry.Ultimately, whether or not there are many other persons 'just like that,' or whether life in Wyoming is 'just like that,' the more important fact is that the film convinces us that there COULD be, and that it is difficult to criticize the characters for the choices they made.My only complaints about the film (minor ones, admittedly) are that I thought the makeup--specifically the fake mustache and the sideburn extensions, could have been improved; and I am not sure what Heath Ledger had in his mouth to make him sound like that--I never saw him dipping snuff.SECOND VIEWING: I have raised my rating. After seeing the film again, there was so much more that I had not noticed before--a sign of an excellent film. The last 5 minutes of this film are absolutely unforgettable.",10,7,11,28 December 2005
Sleepy Hollow," The Biggest Mystery About Sleepy Hollow
","Warning:  Spoiler follows.Why was Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien) in this story?  Obviously, he is the antagonist in Washington Irving's story, but what plot function did this character serve in this film?  He says maybe a total of five words before he is unnecessarily killed off.  He does not even serve as a red herring, because no one could believe that he is the supernatural murderer.My guess (though I am not totally sure) is that Tim Burton liked the image of the headless horseman hurling the jack-o- lantern at Ichabod Crane.  That was a nice dream sequence, but it was completely unnecessary to this film.However, since the film seemed not to know what it wanted to be, an alternate explanation is that this started out much closer to Irving's story, but got transformed along the way.",4,1,2,14 December 1999
Hotel Rwanda," Don Cheadle Was Robbed
","I did not see this film before the Academy Awards ceremony. I wonder how many members of the Academy also did not see this film before the ceremony. Cheadle should have won the Oscar. Though fine work was turned in by the other nominees, Cheadle's performance was breathtaking. And heartbreaking.The very few negative reviews I have read will compare this film to Schindler's List, which also deals with genocide. However, the analogy fails because: (1) Oscar Schindler was not a member of the targeted group; (2) The distinction between Hutu and Tutsi was completely arbitrary and artificial; and (3) The West had 'intervened' in WWII.That distinguishing feature--the West's intervention or lack of it--is doubly ironic: first, it was the West's meddling which had created the problem in Rwanda, both the colonial aspirations and later arming the factions it created. And second, the people we were saving from Hitler were mostly white. No truer words were ever spoken than the line delivered by Nick Nolte's character as an explanation for the lack of concern by the West: 'You're African.' This film was horrifying without being unduly grisly--a remarkable and commendable restraint for a film about a war fought mostly with machetes. And without further explanation (in case you haven't seen the film), I point out there is one particular road trip in this film as chilling as anything in horror films.After about ten minutes into this film, I was thinking, maybe 8/10. By the end, it was a definite 10.",10,3,4,1 March 2005
Nacho Libre," Mediocre but pleasant
","This film should have been so much better. It was a relatively pleasant ninety minutes, and I guess there could really be a Mexican monastery with half-Scandinavian friars who are allowed to date nuns at night. But other than the costumes, this religious institution is unlike any I've ever seen.Jack Black does a terrific job with the little that has been given him, and he is absolutely shameless about his physical appearance. I thought it was interesting that his character was more concerned about the appearance of his wrestling costume than his body.There are so many promising ideas that come to nothing, such as the two midget wrestlers, who could have been much more funny. And the eagle egg scene is just a waste of time. The 'training' sequence has a few pleasant ideas, but I was wondering about some of the elements of the training: how hornets or cow manure figured in a wrestler's training.I had a chuckle or two, but not nearly what I'd expected from a Jack Black film. There was nothing so bad that I wanted to leave the theatre early, but that's hardly a recommendation.",5,0,6,11 July 2006
Shutter Island," It's not 'like' anything
","Please, please do not read this if you have not seen the film already. I am not going to disclose anything major, but the less you know about the plot, the more I think you'd enjoy it.From the time I first saw the trailer for this film, I was amazed that this was by Scorsese. A horror film? Okay. The film certainly establishes the mood and tension of a classic horror film, without dwelling too much on gore or relying too much on surprise cuts and sounds (the 'Boo!' effect).My recollection of the film is that the actors all gave extremely subtle performances which in light of the several plot twists in the end, all still rang true. I enjoyed the film so much on the first viewing knowing nothing, that I must see the film again to see if the earlier scenes still add up.The exterior shots are fascinating. I am not sure if this was a location someone found, or whether it was all created digitally or on a back lot. Even the cemetery scene, almost obligatory in a great horror film, was perfectly devised and filmed. Even the few 'daylight' scenes seem dark and gray, and the reference to a hurricane assaulting the island is an excellent explanation for the gloomy atmosphere to begin, which quickly deteriorates into an extended dark and stormy night when the storm causes a power failure.What is this like? It's not really 'like' anything. There are familiar elements: being cut off from the civilized world due to the weather (The Shining); haunting inexplicable dreams (Spellbound); crazed doctors on deserted islands experimenting on humans (Island of Lost Souls). An occasional similarity, but not a copy of anything.I didn't know the supporting cast before seeing the film, and then I saw Patricia Clarkson giving the best performance by a hallucination that I have ever seen. After you've seen the film, try to figure out what that was all about.Not entirely perfect. But very very close to it. After seeing the film, I have quite a lot of questions. But if absolutely everything was explained in detail, we'd have an 8-hour film. I loved it. I'm going again.* * * * *I've seen the film a second time. I don't think anyone can fully appreciate what Scorsese has done without seeing the film twice. Once you know the 'secret,' you can see how the earlier part of the film is so totally consistent with that secret. All characters act and react exactly in accordance with that secret. The secret is not just a bizarre computer-generated plot twist. The only potentially implausible thing is whether the government would have had the interest or the resources to underwrite what happens in this film, but this is not a film about government financing. This film is absolutely amazing. I upped my rating to a 10.",10,1,5,22 February 2010
Capote," Uncanny performance in enlightening film
","In the seventies, I read the three or four installments of Capote's novel-in-progress, Answered Prayers. The connection of the installments was not clear, but the individual pieces, which could stand on their own as short stories, were breathtaking. Until the time of Capote's death, he assured everyone he was working on the novel, and then, posthumously, it was discovered that there was nothing more--not even an outline.The segments of Answered Prayers were basically in the genre of 'non-fiction novels,' such as In Cold Blood, as the pieces were mostly based upon actual celebrities. I believe that the writing of In Cold Blood not only produced a piece that changed the nature of writing at that time, but it also took a terrible toll on Capote. I cannot help but think that the need for persons to die before he could complete the book, and the fact that the book required the betrayal of friends, all served to affect his future writing.The parallel is there: Capote began work on In Cold Blood when he saw a news article of the deaths of four persons, and his objective was to look for an explanation. He could end his work on In Cold Blood only after the deaths of two more persons, and furnished the explanation for his inability to produce another complete work.Mr. Hoffman's performance in this film is absolutely uncanny. Not only is he a gifted mimic of Capote's speech and mannerisms, but he is able to invest so much meaning without speech or mannerism. For example, the scene in which he says 'goodbye.' Earlier in the film, Capote speaks of his mother having abandoned him for her own reasons. In this goodbye scene, Capote obviously knows that he has already abandoned a friend, and that doing so is the inevitable prerequisite for a great personal success. Hoffman gets all of that across with 'goodbye.' I never imagined that a film about writing could be this good. A definite ten, in my opinion.",10,0,0,30 December 2005
Pacific Rim," Coolant low
","I will keep this short: I was so surprised. I went expecting a cut above the usual action movie, but I was amazed at how terrific this was. The screen play seems to be a collection of virtually every war movie and monster movie clich√© imaginable--all of which is obviously intended. It's like an intelligent and witty Transformers film, if you can imagine. The film does not try to be trendy and it avoids witty dialog, TG. The stock characters are given stock lines to say, and they do it perfectly. For example, the eve-of-battle speech.At first I was wondering if the director knew that the film was just one clich√©, in-joke or film reference after another. There was no doubt that he knew, after I saw the 'Coolant Low' warning.The 3-D and IMAX were distracting. When (not if) I see it again, it will be in 2-D, which is at least one dimension more than most summer action films lately.",9,13,20,30 July 2013
Burn After Reading," Entertaining but disappointing
","It would be very difficult for the Coens to top 'No Country For Old Men.' And they didn't. I regret to say that this was not even close. There are several films by the Coens which will be regarded as classics. This won't be one of them.There were so many talented actors doing excellent work (though I must say that Brad Pitt playing against type just did not score and was ultimately a victim of miscasting). The script got off to a very slow start and gained very little speed. I kept waiting for the action to begin--thinking that we were going through a remarkably extended period of initial exposition, as the characters were established. And then, the film ended.The most interesting character (for me) was J. K. Simmons, who had two scenes and did not do anything but comment on the plot (perhaps giving the audience someone to identify with).After seeing this mildly entertaining way to kill two hours, I can't help but wonder if this project would have been given the green light had the script been pitched by a totally unknown writer. I doubt it very much.",6,1,3,15 September 2008
Knowing," Determinism Equals Intelligent Design?
","Early in the film, there is much made of the very old philosophical question of whether life is merely a random occurrence, or whether there is a plan being followed. This is not just a religious question--it is the FIRST question. And that question leads to others, such as how free will is constrained by the Plan. And the ultimate question--exactly what IS the Plan? This film is based on that series of questions, and the film maker elects to answer the questions unambiguously.An earlier IMDb commentator referred to this film as religious propaganda, a fairly good assessment in my view (my impression of the last scene is that it is located in the New Eden). The aliens were also remarkably similar to angels. The religious propaganda never goes beyond themes into any specific dogma or theology. It is unlikely that any orthodox or fundamentalists would be able to reconcile the film with their beliefs.Determinism seems to be the equivalent of Intelligent Design. The film suggests that the intelligence which originally designed the universe is also still in control--the Planner is determining future events.The creators of this film are entitled to their view, but I think that view would have been much better served had the film ended with Nicolas Cage grieving at the departure of his son. Everything that comes afterward is unnecessary literal confirmation of what should have been only hinted.",6,0,1,15 April 2009
Coriolanus," The tragedy is this was invisible
","If you love Shakespeare, you should see this film. I was not aware this film existed until today. That's the tragedy.The film is done as a 'war movie,' and was promoted as such, but anyone looking for the usual action film will be disappointed in this film. This is not a war movie or an action film, any more than 'Macbeth' would be.This is an adaptation of Shakespeare's play. The setting is modern, but the words are all Shakespeare. I had not encountered Coriolanus since my college days decades ago, when we studied the text. I had never seen a performance of it, and it was considered one of Shakespeare's 'lesser' plays--not much poetry, not much audience appeal.This film was evidently released in this country in early 2012, at the time of year when 'problem' films are usually dumped on the market after the rush of Oscar-worthy movies. I don't recall it being released locally--maybe it played at a local art house. Maybe for a week.I think the film is a triumph for all concerned. The major achievement is making Coriolanus (the character AND the play) cinematically interesting. The script did an excellent job of pruning the text. Purists may recoil, but let's face it, a scene performed in front of military tanks not what Shakespeare would have imagined. Further, the script did not attempt to call attention to the cleverness of the adaptation, such as how a modern legislative chamber is used in place of the Roman senate. Instead, the script focused on the enduring issues, such as whether a public servant is chosen to execute the will of the people, or whether the servant is intended to exercise those personal qualities which caused him to be chosen. Or the question of whether there should be a separation between elected officials and the military.With respect to the cast, I have nothing but praise, and astonishment. Ralph Fiennes did a remarkable job, showing a restraint which was sometimes absent from earlier films which he did not also direct. Vanessa Redgrave was just incredibly perfect. She has had many recent, excellent bits in very low-key roles (e.g., Atonement). But here, she is given an opportunity to show what she can do, and the effect is heart-wrenching.Jessica Chastain did a fine job in what was basically a bit part. And Gerard Butler was (for me) the major surprise. Maybe he was offered the role because an 'action film' actor was needed to boost box-office appeal. Regardless, he was allowed to perform without regard to affecting a British accent (or any other accent). The choice to allow him to focus on emotion rather than sound was a major plus. (Side note: Butler's first theatrical offering was in a production of Coriolanus. See Wikipedia.) Brian Cox is a grossly under-appreciated supporting actor. His final scene (with dialogue) is the best of the film.I can't believe I missed this when it was released. I am so glad I found it today.",10,0,2,10 March 2013
U-571," A sea yawn
","The film is basically unnecessary.  I doubt that anyone who has seen 'Das Boot' will prefer this film.  The characters have personal conflicts which seem to have been devised by a computer.  Apparently the producers thought that stealing the Enigma machine and thereby saving the free world is not enough of a goal--the characters must also attain personal redemption. The costuming and editing are confusing in the initial confrontation on the submarine, and it is hard to follow the action.  But this confusion is soon overshadowed by the increasingly unbelievable plot developments and the convenient durability of a certain U-boat.  The most unforgivable transgression is that this film manages to make Matthew McConaughey and Jon Bon Jovi look unattractive.",5,0,1,27 April 2000
Salt," Mindless summer fun
","This film has about as much action as can be crammed into a 90-minute movie. Of course, everything in the film is basically unbelievable: such as Angelina Jolie being bulletproof, scaling walls like Spider Man, plus a whole lot of surprising resurrections--so why should anything else be believable? Angelina and Liev Schreiber (who plays her colleague) are gifted enough to get the audience through several plot twists.I was never bored, and there was some considerable suspense which built up near the end. I think the film can definitely be enjoyed if not too much thought is given to the motivations of certain characters. And the body count by the end of the film.",8,3,9,27 July 2010
Jarhead," The last in a terrific trilogy
","The Hurt Locker, Brothers, and Jarhead. In that order.Chronologically, you'd move Jarhead to the starting position. But the final scene in Jarhead cannot be topped. So I choose it as the end of this ad hoc desert war trilogy.I avoided this film when it was first released. From the trailer, it seemed like it would be a predictable gung-ho ad for the Marines. And it was shunned by any major awards. My, how everyone was wrong. This film was a victim of miscalculated ads and PR. Those looking for The Sands of Iwo Jima were disappointed, and those who would enjoy a character study with more questions than answers were scared away.The actors in the film are outstanding. Chris Cooper doing another Marine, after American Beauty. Jamie Foxx before the Ray Charles Oscar, and Jake Gyllenhaal before Brokeback, for example.This is not an action/war movie. It is beautiful, thoughtful, and message-free. It doesn't explain Why. You supply that answer, if you can.",9,1,2,27 February 2013
American History X," Talking Oneself Out of an Oscar
","One day, I'd like to see Tony Kaye's cut of this film, since he believes it was 'ruined' by others (star, editor, producers).  While some of the elements were a bit too abrupt, the film did not dispense easy answers to tough questions, nor did it sentimentalize or offer a pasted-on happy ending.  Very few current movies are so thought provoking.I think that the comments by Tony Kaye were due more to injured pride than injured film.  There are sure to be many acting nominations from this film, and I think the director may have talked himself out of an Oscar by claiming that the end product is not his.",10,0,0,5 December 1998
Pearl Harbor," Half Bad
","I saw only two hours worth, and by that time, I didn't care how it came out--neither the war nor that sappy romance.  The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor (what most people would assume this film is about) was compelling, but all tension and horror was obliterated by the constant cutting away from history, in order to dwell upon that incredibly bad Hardy Boys response by Our Heroes.  Two touching moments, before I made my escape (I left right after that Date Which Will Live In Infamy):  Cuba Gooding's brief moment with the dying captain of his ship; and the nurses facing the influx of an overwhelming number of casualties.   The former was so unexpected, so brief and had so much humanity in it; and the latter would be a worthy subject for a film of its own, but instead was obscured by artsy 'blurred' cinematography, to suggest confusion in lieu of dramatizing it.",4,0,0,20 June 2001
Tropic Thunder," Surprisingly funny
","I had not read much about this film before seeing it, and basically was looking for a pleasant way to kill 2 hours. I'd seen Stiller films before, and Jack Black films before, and they were mildly funny (at best) but often seemed a bit self-indulgent.This film is their best work to date. No doubt about it. The opening was a bit off-putting, with some really gross cartoonish violence. But by the time of the first 'Cut!' a few minutes into the film, the laughter had started. The story is a bit scattershot, but there are some comic scenes in this film that rival anything I have seen in many many years.Matthew McConaughey was perfect in his role--extremely funny, and not trading on his image as a movie hunk--for example, he did not take off his shirt in this film, something that cannot often be said of him.

No Country for Old Men," 'Near perfect execution of a difficult task'
","A. O. Scott of the NY Times said that, and I can only agree. In trying to think of flaws in this film, my only qualm is that it could have been a little less gory--do we really need to see, in extreme close-up, various wounds being attended to? I had to avert my eyes.However, there were other equally bloody scenes in which the gore was actually funny (think wood-chipper from 'Fargo').Aside from my squeamishness, I thought this film was perfect. I can't recommend any improvement. And I can't say that about many films, ever.What most impressed me was that the Texas dialogue was perfect. Perhaps Texans don't always speak in such shockingly beautiful words, but they could have. Tommy Lee Jones' character was authentic, and could have said those exact words. But aside from the script, what Tommy Lee Jones added is incalculable.The same is true of Javier Bardem. His lines were few, and were not poetic. His non-verbal interpretation of the part is a breathtaking accomplishment on its own, and he is ready for the Rogue's Gallery of the greatest villains of all time.Until I checked the credits afterwards, I was not sure who played Llewellyn. OMG. Josh Brolin? Who would have thought he had such talent within him? I could go on and on, but this is the best 2007 film I have seen so far. I was thoroughly entertained, engrossed, laughing, crying, and wanting to see it again.",10,0,5,30 January 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Simply awful
","I rented this film with high expectations. The expectations were consistently lowered through the first 30 minutes of viewing, until I was beginning to feel like a fool by continuing to watch something this bad.The cinematography is postcard-perfect. The rest of the film really sucks. It starts with a very pretentious narration, which continues throughout the film. Casey Affleck starts by mumbling his lines. Everyone else, including Bradd Pitt as Jesse, is totally undecipherable, despite the narrator telling us what to think and explaining what is going on.The film starts with an extended night sequence, leading me to wonder if this would be an attempt at film noir. Nothing much happens during the sequence. For a 'western' this film has amazingly little action. I've seen Ingmar Bergman films with more life.This film doesn't even work as a character study. It certainly aspires to do so, but between the mumbling, stasis and pretentiousness, I decided I had enough about 30 minutes into it. The last ninety minutes might be absolutely terrific, but I doubt it. I am not going to rate this film because I did not see most of it. Not having to sit through it all would probably cause me to be more generous with it.This is just awful.",Null,0,4,6 April 2008
Meet the Fockers," Missed opportunity
","When you have a cast which includes three persons who have won Oscars for acting and one who has won a Tony for acting, the result should be much, much better than this. The choice of Streisand and Hoffman as the elder Fockers was inspired, and it is a shame that the script and direction did not exhibit similar inspiration.The problem, in my opinion, was that the set-up evolved into a La Cage Aux Folles idea: to hide one's parents from one's prospective in-laws. It would have been wonderful to allow Blythe Danner to do something more than merely to tut-tut at Robert De Niro, or to allow De Niro to do something more than make faces, or to let Streisand put De Niro in his place.The film was amiable, with a few good jokes, some of which went on a bit too long. And if you watch the deleted scenes on DVD, there is one total misfire that you can only be grateful they did not include in the theatrical version (and should not have included on the DVD, it is so awful).",5,0,1,5 June 2005
The Mist," I'm sorry I can't recommend it
","There is a significant difference between a short story and a movie. An ending of a short story may prove to be a disaster in a film. And I think that's exactly what happens here.A short story is not required to have a 'happy' ending. In contrast, a theatrical film which expects a person to get out of their home, travel to the theater, and sit through two hours of cinema, had better have some kind of reward for the viewer. If not a classically happy ending, at least one which furnishes some kind of catharsis or resolution of themes brought up earlier in the film--a satisfying ending, if not a happy one.This film fails miserably. The ending is unsatisfying, unhappy, and deeply depressing. Recall that earlier in the film, the question of euthanasia was raised and was firmly rejected. In the ending, there seems to be a change of heart. Why? The question does not need an explicit answer, but at least a hint of an explanation. Otherwise, the ending seems totally arbitrary (as it did here).Beyond the euthanasia issue, the ending seemed extremely contrived. Rescue became available within a minute of the unfortunate killings? Oh, please. It's like deus ex machina, but one minute too late.In sum, a basically unexplained enemy kills a lot of people in unpleasant ways. No one figures out how to fight back, and virtually everyone dies. The only difference in the deaths is that the bad people generally died first.I always love Thomas Jane. He's so cute, and so intense, but is always a blank at conveying anything other than what's written in the lines.If you love Thomas Jane or Stephen King, you may like this film. I can't say I hated it, but it was very unsatisfying.",4,35,67,11 December 2007
The Hurt Locker," Failure as a documentary
","From what I have read, this film fails to accurately portray daily life for the EOD troops in Iraq in 2004. A documentary with such a flaw is completely unacceptable. As a documentary.However, I don't think this was intended to be a documentary. Was it? Maybe there was a statement in the titles indicating the film was based on actual events. But I didn't see that title, either.Does a viewer need to have first hand knowledge of the true situation in order to properly assess this film? I don't think so.I am not judging the film by its fidelity to actual situations, because I don't know enough to make that call. However, I think I can judge its quality as cinema.I actually thought the script was disappointing. Some things were just mystifying. Will's trip to visit the parents of Beckham. Finding a still-burning cigarette. Both of those incidents led to nothing.And I hate to say it, but I thought Will's character was a bit under-written. Jeremy Renner did a very convincing job, but it would have been nice to have a bit more information on why he could be so fearless, to such an extent that his fellow soldiers could seriously discuss fragging him for their own safety.A film is not required to provide all the answers, but a few more clues would have been beneficial. The film was two hours long, so perhaps there were clues that were cut in order to shorten the running time.The ensemble acting was terrific, and the direction was at least not noticeable. I thought this was a nice little film, but not spectacular.",8,1,5,18 March 2010
K-19: The Widowmaker," Long and unfocused
","Perhaps the reason why this film runs two hours and twenty minutes is that after commercials are added, the film will fill the 3-hour docudrama slot on Sunday night network TV.  Every underdeveloped theme in this film was done better elsewhere, and the film makers should have limited themselves to one or two themes in an attempt to create something new.  I thought this was a major disappointment, and I do not see where the participation of National Geographic was of any ultimate benefit.",4,1,2,21 July 2002

The Twilight Saga: New Moon," The horror! The horror!
","I saw the first film, basically for lack of anything else to do while on vacation. I saw about the first half of this one, before I decided to find something better to do.Jacob and his buds chased Victoria from Forks 'up to the Canadian border.' Meaning they chased her out to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and they all dived into the water and swam out half-way to the border. Or maybe they chased her in a giant U-turn all the way around Puget Sound and up to Canada. Or maybe they took a Seattle ferry (eastbound is free) and they all did laps chasing Victoria around the promenade deck until the ferry landed and they chased Victoria up to Victoria (why the border? No passports?). This was one of the two interesting 'mysteries' in this film.Poor Bella. Her major B.F. is a vampire, and her substitute B.F. is a werewolf. And her father is oblivious. Doesn't know who his daughter is running with.Vampires are apparently created, not procreated. A lifestyle 'choice,' I guess. Whereas werewolf-ism is a genetic trait, apparently limited to teenage males of the Quillayute tribe. What I noticed was the vamps and the wolves dissing each other, using quasi-racist insults.The pack of werewolves was interesting. Others have remarked on the Spandex. At first I thought it was a practical consideration, due to regular clothes being destroyed when the inner animal came out. But the CGI wolves were not wearing Spandex. And during one scene in which Jacob transforms, we actually see the shreds of his clothing flying off as he expands and changes in mid-leap. So when he changes back, where does he get the clothes? This was the other interesting mystery. I think the film makers cheated their teenage girl audience. Though it might be because Jacob won't be 18 until Feb 2010.About half-way through, I could not understand why Bella was still interested in Edward, when there was a local teen wolf who had many admirable qualities and who loved her and he did not suffer from bad makeup. So I left. Maybe I missed the big scene at the end where Bella is bitten by a smart bug and develops some common sense and goes for the wolf. But somehow I doubt it.",4,9,15,29 November 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A love letter to New Orleans
","I actually went to see this film, not knowing that it was set in New Orleans. I knew only that it had gotten a negative review from Roger Ebert, a critic I respect. It sounded like basically a vanity project for Brad Pitt.Yes, indeed, there is very much pride evident here, but it is pride in New Orleans rather than an overinflated ego. This is a love letter to New Orleans. I don't know of any other film which makes any better use of the city--it was even used for scenes set in Russia, Paris and New York. And it was also a period piece. I think the most remarkable fact about a nearly three hour film set in New Orleans is that there is not a single reference to Mardi Gras. Beyond this, the city and its history play an integral part of the story, rather than simply serving as a quaint backdrop.I don't know of any accent that was misplaced. The production design and art direction were stunning.With respect to the plot, the premise of a man being born old and growing younger would have served for the backdrop for a science fiction film. Or worse yet, a comedy. But the film makers here do not try to explore or explain Benjamin's condition. I think that the most uniquely New Orleans touch is that no character actually treats Benjamin like a freak.If you must have an explanation, you will probably not like this film. The film makers tell you this with the opening story about the clock. In the real world, that situation would not be allowed to continue--not even in New Orleans.The film avoids most of the major historical incidents and developments--those which are not needed for the story. For example, the racial segregation in New Orleans is simply ignored, since it would cause problems with the story. And I am not totally sure about the historical accuracy of the tugboat in WW2. But historical accuracy is not the point.Even the final image is true only in a general sense, but not literally.The acting was excellent. Brad was miscast and wasted in 'Burn After Reading,' but here he scores a major triumph. And Cate Blanchett may be in line for yet another Oscar. I have not seen all of 2008's films yet, but this is my favorite so far.A line of dialogue, when Tilda Swinton asks Brad where he's from:Brad-- New Orleans. (pause) Louisiana.Tilda-- Is there more than one?",10,0,2,6 January 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," News as Entertainment
","I went with high expectations, and at the start I thought it was terrific, and it only got better.Shockingly good. The use of Billie Holliday as interludes, in lieu of a score was outstanding. The use of black and white not only allowed the filmmakers to use actual footage, but our memories of Edward R. Murrow are all black and white.There are so many interesting but very subtle contrasts here, and there are parallels that might be drawn between these events of the fifties and subsequent occurrences. It would be a disservice to point them out if you have not seen the film.The acting was uniformly awe-inspiring. Let me leave you with one impression I had: before I saw the film, I had read little about it, and knew only the subject it dealt with. I didn't know for sure who directed it, but thought I recalled that Clooney did. As well as writing it. Toward the end, when Bill Paley (Frank Langella) gives bad news to Murrow and Friendly (George Clooney), Paley asks Friendly to stay for a moment as Murrow leaves the room. Oh, no, I thought, here is the Oscar-winning scene that Clooney wrote for himself (because there had not been any until then). I had to wait for the credits and then I was amazed that Clooney had in fact directed and written the film--because there was NO Oscar-winning scene. The camera waited outside with Murrow. This is definitely not a Clooney ego trip. The news of the fifties was very entertaining today. I'd give it an eleven if I was allowed.",10,5,9,11 December 2005
Evil Dead," Grossly disappointing
","If there was a moment of wit or humor in this film, I missed it. Perhaps it occurred while I took a restroom break for a minute or two.In 1981, when the theme of a group of youngsters imperiled in a deserted location was by no means new, Sam Raimi created The Evil Dead, and the film obviously did not take itself too seriously. In my estimation, Raimi was not attempting to one-up George Romero's Night of The Living Dead. Do I think The Evil Dead was intended to be taken as basically a horror film? No. Not at all. In 1981, Raimi took what was already a clich√© in horror films, and made what is mostly a parody of such films. Yet the genius in the film is that Raimi's film could be enjoyed as a horror film by anyone unaware of what Raimi was doing. (Unlike the 'Scary Movie' films, obviously intended as parody.)This film was promoted as being a remake of the 1981 film. If the creators of Evil Dead (2013) think their film is a remake of Raimi's, I can only say that they are probably one of those unaware of what Raimi was doing in 1981.This film--depressingly unfunny, and incessantly gross and unpleasant. How do we distinguish it from any of the dozens of other similar unfunny and gross 'horror' films being released? Well, perhaps because this one did not go straight to video, though don't ask me why.So, if you are expecting a remake of the 1981 film, generally similar to the original, you should plan to be disappointed. If you don't have any idea of the 1981 film, and you are entertained by unfunny, gross and unpleasant horror films, you will love this one.",3,22,41,7 May 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Really gruesome
","After the first ten or twenty gallons of blood (i.e., after about ten minutes into the film), it became somewhat repetitious.  Are there any real characters here, amid the blood and action?  Are we really supposed to care about any of these people?  Totally aside from motivation.  I know that Tarantino doesn't explain everything in a linear fashion, and perhaps Part Two contains the justification for anyone enduring the first part.  But I'll never know unless I read it somewhere.This was an excellently made film.  I only wish that I found some purpose in all the proficiency.",4,2,4,16 October 2003
Clash of the Titans," How to train your Kraken
","Toothless is lucky that he did not decide to attack Argos, or he might have been turned into stone in addition to being misunderstood. As for the mythology, just forget anything you may have earlier read--you are probably better off if you have never read anything about the ancient myths. And probably better off if you have not seen the eighties film.The ancient 'politics' behind this film were muddled. It first seemed like man vs. gods. And then it seemed like Zeus vs. Hades. And then there was Perseus, who was a demigod and seemed rather confused. But probably no more confused than his father Zeus, who eventually ordered Hades to 'Release the Kraken.' And why did they have to wait until the eclipse? Why not instant revenge on the mortals? Why was Zeus still speaking to Hades? Didn't Zeus know what Hades was doing? And if the Kraken was kept under the sea, what became of Poseidon? Maybe the god of the sea was lost in a budget-cut. Or maybe his part was given to Ralph Fiennes. And the Kraken gets released, and then gets marble-ized within a minute of emerging from the deep. Not much suspense there.The hunting of Medusa is an example of bigger not really being better. In the eighties film, you had a sense of space--the arrangement of the pillars in Medusa's residence. Here, Medusa had moved to a place in the country--on the other side of the River Styx, and why? Who would need to be turned into stone after they were already dead? Would Medusa find much fun in killing boatloads of already dead tourists? Her lair was just a confusing craggy locale with a pit of fire somewhere inside. You had no idea where anyone was.The gods seemed to be British (Liam and Ralph), and the bastard demigod son was Australian. Hmmm . . . And the not-very-comic relief sounded vaguely Russian. Was a statement being made? And Pegasus was black. But apparently had a lot of white girlfriends. And Perseus could just hop right on Pegasus at will whenever necessary, like hailing a taxi. And if there were all those other winged horses, why didn't Perseus and his buds just saddle up, rather than having to travel by scorpion?There was no real way to care much for any of these characters. I didn't hate the film (I didn't see it in 3-D) because it's not that awful. It's just not very good.",5,2,4,9 April 2010
The Hangover Part II," Monkey shines
","After reading reviews from critics I respect, I was reluctant to see this film, which I heard was an inferior copy of the original. I totally loved the original, and had limited hopes for this one. So I was pleasantly surprised. Don't take this as a recommendation.Some potentially hilarious scenes are a fizzle, such as the bit with the monk. Some scenes are more gross than funny, such as Samir's night club with the pole dancers. But there is one element that is priceless: the monkey. Especially the later scenes with the monkey. I usually don't like monkeys in movies, but this is the best performance by a monkey I have ever seen. A lot of the performance is probably CGI, but still . . .",6,0,1,15 June 2011
Sinister," Creepy little film
","This is a good example of the 'Boo!' horror film, which uses sudden loud noises to scare the audience. Once or twice is fine with me, but this film depended on it.I thought the film was decent, but not terrific. The set up was both interesting and creepy. But a film in which the main character is a writer of unsolved crime nonfiction, it should not have taken the length of this film for even a partially intuitive person to figure out what was going on. Especially since most of the audience knew what was going to happen by no more than half way through.I would have been more interested to see how the protagonist deals with an inescapable fate: does he provoke the end by leaving the haunted house, or is he trapped there forever? Of course, in most horror films you can't ask why the main character did not take the action that any sane person would take. For example, turning over the films to the police. He didn't take that action because that would have ended the film about ten minutes after it began.This will be a good film to watch on TV at home late at night. It will probably scare you, but if it doesn't and you doze off, it will wake you up before long. Boo!",6,1,1,19 October 2012
Groundhog Day," Neglected Masterpiece
","I thought the film was terrific when I saw it in theaters twelve years ago. Recently in watching it again on cable, I was amazed at the quality of the screenplay. I didn't notice the first time. But on repeated viewings (like reliving Groundhog Day), I was impressed at the story created by the writers. This film is so much more than witty jokes and comic riffs arranged around a gimmick. It has an internal logic and consistency that is very rarely found in screenplays. No joke seemed disposable, and as you laugh your way along, the philosophy underlying the film takes over your imagination.Check the IMDb listings for this film's awards: look at the numerous British awards for writing. And yet this film was not even nominated for an Oscar. It is so rare that a film's jokes seem just as fresh more than a decade later, but I believe that is because the theme underlying the humor will never go out of fashion.The acting was terrific, and I now think this is Bill Murray's best work (though I didn't take it seriously when I first saw the film.) But the screenplay is the one of the finest ever written. I don't know if it's studied in film schools, but it ought to be.* * * * *ON HAROLD RAMIS' DEATH: Ramis told The Associated Press in a 2009 story about the 50th anniversary of Second City. 'When you hit it right, those things last.'I found that quote in a story on Ramis' death. The story curiously did not mention 'Groundhog Day.' If there is any film to serve as a fitting memorial for Harold Ramis, it must be 'Groundhog Day.' A totally perfect script, perfectly executed. He hit it right, and when will he get the recognition he deserved decades ago?",10,339,398,21 August 2005
Les Mis√©rables," Wanted to like this much much more
","I felt very Miserables as I sat there, the only person in the theatre. The transfer from stage to screen was filled with problems. First, they couldn't cast basic unknowns in the lead roles of a big budget movie. They certainly could have found some actors/actresses who did Les Miz on stage and cast them (because they would know how to sing).If this was just a remake of the non-musical earlier films, I'd say that the acting was inspired, and a film with the same actors, sets, direction, but without singing, would be Oscar-worthy. Unfortunately, I found that the biggest distraction was the music. Bad thing about a musical.This is basically an opera. Onstage, there were only a few words which were spoken--everything else was sung. In an opera, the effect is created by beautiful music, expressive lyrics which denote what the characters are feeling, and singers who can sing. In grand opera, the typical audience member is far away (there are no close-ups), so subtle emoting is unnecessary in opera--the lyrics tell you what the character is feeling, and your imagination supplies what he or she might have as facial expressions, based on the lyrics.So having an extremely talented film actor (but a very mediocre singer) such as Russell Crowe sing a major role is a big problem. Expressive lyrics were unnecessary for him to put across the mental anguish of his character--his few non-singing moments were absolute perfection, because Javert is a very, very difficult character to make convincing. However, his final aria was unnecessary because he had already conveyed every word in that aria, but without signing. For example, when you see the film, he silently pins a medal on someone, and that five seconds on film said more than the final aria.Hugh Jackman was acceptable as Jean Valjean, but this should not be surprising because he won a Tony Award for singing Curley (Gordon MacRae's role) in Oklahoma!, in a Broadway revival. And he is an absolutely terrific musical stage actor. I can't fault his acting or singing. And noteworthy is the fact that the filmmakers resisted the temptation to find some excuse for Jean Valjean to lose his shirt, which in general is kind of a waste in a Hugh Jackman film, but TG they avoided unhelpful show-stoppers.Anne Hathaway was great, having to sing a deathbed soliloquy naturalistically in close-up horror-show makeup, but the director's insistence on putting her in excessively squalid surroundings was unnecessary, distracting, and counterproductive. Really: someone who has been so abused and is dying of consumption is not going to be warbling like a nightingale. Give the girl a break.Amanda Seyfried was surprising as Cosette. She started in soap operas, and had a few interesting but non-descript roles (she is playing Linda Lovelace in the film of that title to be released this year). Here she sings a high soprano flawlessly.When you see the film and are amazed at how great Eponine sings her songs: Samantha Barks (Eponine) played the role onstage.The Thenardier couple is played by Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen, and they are an invaluable addition of comic relief to a very downbeat story. I thought their opening number could have been a lot better if it had remained a rousing bar-song rather than turning it into a parade of unnecessarily-real grotesques.If you are not familiar with the musical, then the film may give you a good idea of what the stage show was. The dilemma faced by this film was how to replicate the stage show with the best chance for financial success.The final scene is a close (and very good) replication of the stage version. And the Bishop, who appeared early in the film and had very very much to do with all that happens afterwards, makes a return appearance for the finale. In the film, the part is played by Colm Wilkinson, the first Jean Valjean in the Broadway show.You probably should see the film. I am not saying you should rush out and pay full price.",6,1,3,9 January 2013
War of the Worlds," Tom's son was the true hero
","The old film followed the usual 50's sci-fi conventions of trying to figure out the invaders' weakness and develop an appropriate weapon. The twist was that humans could not do that, and that ultimately the aliens were stopped by a providential Creator. The ending addressed the problem.In Spielberg's film, the bulk of the story is an incredible journey survival story. The protagonist's goal is to reach Boston, not to stop the aliens. Well, Tom and family actually reach Boston--mission accomplished! Oh, and by the way, the aliens die--almost coincidentally. 'Welcome to Boston. And you might want to avoid that falling alien on your way to grandma's.' There's a moderately entertaining bit in the middle with Tim Robbins and aliens and a game of hide-and-seek. But that has nothing to do with very much. Tom's son turns up in Boston for the reunion at the end. We don't know how, because we weren't shown his story. But I can bet it was a lot more interesting that the story we were shown in this film--because Tom's son wanted to stop the aliens and separated from Tom just for that reason.The initial huge and realistic devastation of a city was extremely depressing in light of the experience of recent years, and showing that our nation was impotent to deal with the problem was even more depressing. The ending where the aliens die from a common cold did nothing to relieve the depression. Maybe Tom's son was the real hero of the film--maybe he coughed on them, or popped a zit in their direction.",5,2,4,14 July 2005
12 Years a Slave," Must be something wrong with me
","I really disliked this film. I am not saying it's not a fine film. I am not saying it is inaccurate. I am not saying that anyone who enjoys it is wrong. It is certainly thought-provoking. But it told me nothing new, offered no new insights, and I found it to be unrelievedly gruesome and depressing. After about an hour of the film, I decided to stop squirming and leave--that I would enjoy not seeing it more than actually seeing it. For this reason I did not rate it.I wasn't expecting sweetness and light from this film, only perhaps a little enlightenment presented in an entertaining or at least endurable manner. There must be something wrong with me--how dare I not like it? I recommend that everyone see the film. But if you don't like it, you are not alone.",Null,10,22,6 November 2013
There Will Be Blood," Not what I expected
","I was expecting a film to equal Magnolia or Gangs of New York (both 10's in my estimation). This was barely an 8.My mild disappointment begins with Daniel Day-Lewis' very eccentric performance. Maybe the director wanted to have an enigma as the central character, but throughout the film (and afterward), I was trying to get a focus on what Mr. Plainview wanted. I still don't know.The 'conversion' scene in church, and the final scene in the bowling alley--plenty of emotion was being displayed, but if the motivation is beyond comprehension, how do we know this is not just scenery-chewing? The final scene in the bowling alley was very well-constructed, very powerful, but very baffling. After the film, as I exited the theater with other mid-week matin√©e patrons, I heard several commenting on how the film was not as good as they had heard it was. I can't help but agree.The film is very interesting, worthwhile, and thought-provoking. The technical aspects are superb. This is not DDL's best work. He certainly deserves an Oscar. But not for this.",8,4,9,14 February 2008
Burlesque," Pleasant but mediocre
","I think the general plot setup was decades old when used in 'Showgirls' a decade ago. Except that the heroine in Showgirls had a dark side and was not a total saint. Christina did a fine job with the stock part she was given. It was also good to see Cher, but that's about all we did was see her. The leading men were picturesque, doing their part to 'flesh out' the cast.I didn't hate the show: it was pleasant. There seemed to be more production numbers than usual, but given the rather routine non-musical scenes, that is probably not a complaint.My problem with the film was not the general unbelievability of the existence of a club with perhaps 20 tables, being able to support a technical production to rival a Broadway show: costumes, sets, lighting, etc., plus about six to eight dancers and a five or six piece band. The major deficiency was the script.Alan Cumming as the box-office person? From MC in 'Cabaret' to ticket-taker here. I don't know who to blame for that.",4,3,8,30 November 2010
Raging Bull," Surprising After 25 Years
","I avoided seeing this film until today. Despite the awards and almost uniformly good reviews, I was not attracted by the thought of a realistic boxing film, and so I never saw this film either in theatres, or on cable. I rented the DVD today and watched it, and I was mesmerized throughout. I understand this film came out during the year of Chariots of Fire. If that is true, then Scorsese was robbed, in my opinion. This film was even better than The Aviator.I'm glad I was not aware how the film ends, and so I am calling this comment a spoiler. Jake sitting before a mirror rehearsing Brando's 'contender' speech from On The Waterfront--it left me weak when I realized what was occurring. An actor playing a real boxer rehearsing a speech given in a film by an actor playing a fictional boxer. And both actors won Oscars for giving that speech. That scene was so simple, so unexpected, yet so true to the rest of the film.There was not a dull moment in it, and unlike some of Scorsese's subsequent films, the film presented its story very economically, without unnecessary effects and unnecessary scenes.",10,2,2,2 April 2005
The Dark Knight Rises," Does anyone remember when Batman was fun and campy?
","You might see the film and think this is the greatest film ever. I am glad for you. But I recall what Batman comics were, and I recall what good films were, and this film was very disappointing. Good, but not great.I saw it on the first day of release, but I delayed in writing this comment because I wanted to think it over.Obviously, to call this film the third in a trilogy, there was a need to relate it to the two previous films, and to seem to tie the films together. I thought such tying was extremely forced and contrived. The various plot twists (which I won't reveal) were exciting and believable, but the enormous amount of 'backstory' added to tie everything together seemed to me to be totally contrived.Does anyone remember when Batman was fun and campy? Did anyone think that Adam West was going to have a dark (k)night of the soul? Does anyone recall why Tim Burton's Batman films were so much fun? There is an absolutely excruciating fifteen minutes or so in the middle of this film that I'd like never to experience again. Brutal and depressing. (My complaint is not about the acting or direction. Just the idea.) But after Chris Nolan got beyond the need to 'tie up' the trilogy, the ending of the film was satisfactory (even though it did not foreclose the possibility of further sequels.) The ending went far toward redeeming the misery of the middle.The film should be seen, without a doubt. Just don't plan to have a lot of fun.",7,4,9,23 July 2012
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Where was Sir Francis Drake?
","Maybe Raleigh in this film was a combination of him and Francis Drake. Or maybe the screenwriter got them confused. You'd never tell it from this film, but Raleigh was a poet and not Captain Blood. Until this film, I'd never really considered Raleigh in any other light but as a learned courtier.But I don't really care. The film got the general tension correct between England and Spain. If the film is not approached as a history lesson, it is moderately enjoyable in a very low-key way. There is not very much for a viewer to identify with.The acting is excellent and the costumes are Oscar-worthy. It's a shame that such talent did not have a better script.",6,7,12,15 October 2007
Flight," Contemporary morality play
","Anyone who thinks this is a disaster film (something like 'Airport') will probably be surprised, and possibly disappointed. The end of the doomed flight is a perfect piece of suspense and tension. But that episode is not the theme of the film.This film is actually about addiction (including alcoholism), but it is definitely not a sermon. Anyone unfamiliar with the illness may not notice what is being presented--so light is the touch here, and so excellent are the performances. There is an early scene of the dismal effect of addiction, and that is contrasted with a view of someone equally addicted but who is still 'functioning.' Is substance abuse not really a problem until something horrible happens as a result? Decades ago, Ray Milland won an Oscar for playing an alcoholic in 'The Lost Weekend.' And then there was 'Days of Wine and Roses.' There have been harrowing films exploring the depths of drug addiction, and the withdrawal from it. Denzel Washington makes the same point, without having an extended scene of excessive 'drunk' behavior. While prior films on the subject had casts and situations which really punched across the message, this film opts for a more subtle message in an interesting story.For example, when Nicole puts a blanket over Whip and leaves him, rather than helping him to his feet and tucking him in bed. When she is on the porch and Whip takes a quick glance at the book she has with her. Some of us know what she was reading and it's not a Bible).Note the various contexts of 'act of God,' and not just as a legal term: such as the members of the church returning daily to the crash site, the meaning that some survivors take from the fact that they survived, the issue of any divine intent behind cancer.There is also a great paradox in this film. Examine what you wish to happen in the final hearing. Who are you cheering for? The exchange between Whip and Ellen Block (the terrific Melissa Leo), is one of the most powerful scenes in quite some time. Without shouting, antagonism and wild emotions, Denzel and Melissa put it across. That final silent look she gives him has so much in it. I need to see that again.I won't say anything about the plot except this: anyone who laughs when the second refrigerator is opened has totally missed the point.",10,3,6,5 November 2012
Thirteen Days," Unnecessary Star
","Kevin Costner's character was totally unnecessary to this film.  We could have done without the attempt to turn the Missile Crisis into a personal drama.  The attempt to make this episode universal managed to trivialize it. Those same themes were dealt with more cogently in 'Fail-Safe,' both the film from the Missile Crisis era, and the recent live TV broadcast.  I was hoping (against hope) that some new perspective would be added, and for a while, it appeared as though the Adlai Stevenson storyline would be pursued. I was wrong.  Instead, we got more of the Costner family.Also, Costner should avoid doing accents:  not only does he do them badly (see, e.g., 'JFK') but it is patronizing to assume that everyone from a given locale must have an accent.  I've known a few people from the Boston area, and no one sounded like that.Also, I want to know if it is possible to have a spoiler in a comment on a docudrama?  Possibly there are some viewers who might not be aware how the crisis was resolved.",5,6,10,2 January 2001
Sin City," Graphic movie of graphic novel
","I haven't read the source material, and so I can't address whether the film was faithful to its source. In general I liked this film, but not ravingly so. I would have enjoyed it more had I cringed less, but I understand that that cringe-inducement is part of the film's charm for its many fans.I can't fault the acting, which was never less than impressive (particularly those actors having to deal with a considerable amount of makeup). I thought Mickey Rourke was especially good, and it took me some time to realize it was him. The computer effects in this film were less distracting for me than those of Sky Captain.I enjoyed the film, and I would not discourage anyone from seeing it. I just could have done with a lot less gore (even yellow gore).",7,0,3,4 April 2005
The Cabin in the Woods," No sequel
","I doubt that there will be a sequel to this.The beginning of the film tells you this is not the usual horror film, and you may quickly come to a conclusion as to what is really going on--the 'victims' in the film are similarly trying to find out what is really going on. You try to think of the right category: haunted house? slasher? mad doctor? evil spirits? Or possibly this is more a science fiction film than a horror movie? Or maybe . . . it's something else entirely.I thoroughly enjoyed the film. I was not bored at all, and I certainly cannot think of another horror film this is 'just like.' The acting is fine. The characters are intended to be stereotypes, and the actors make them interesting.The last part of the film has some very subtle wicked humor. The film also features some plot-connected marijuana use, which under the existing criteria probably did more to earn this film an R rating than did the gore or the nudity.",8,1,13,13 April 2012
Atonement," Glad I knew nothing about it in advance
","This is a romance set in England just prior to and during WW2. This was all I knew about the film before seeing it. I didn't read the novel. I had no real desire to see the film--it was more a matter of a convenient show time rather than being on my must-see list. If you do not know much about the film or novel, please do not read further.The film begins in a generally conventional way for a British period piece, but then a few events are shown from two different points of view--one which is objective and one which is very subjective. Showing the different points of view have fractured the time line, so in the second half of the film, the shifts in time continue--but is it also a shift from objective to subjective POV's again? The ending of this film was profoundly moving. I had no idea at all that Vanessa Redgrave was in this film. Her three or four minutes, in extreme close-up, are perfect. Absolutely perfect.Note what happens to your hopes during this film. The first half of the film ends with Robbie being unjustly arrested and hauled off. In the next scene, several years later, we find Robbie in uniform in France, and so we assume that the injustice has been corrected, otherwise he would be in prison. Then we find that he signed up in order to be released from prison. We then find him meeting Cecelia again, but this was prior to the scene in France. Will the lovers eventually be reunited? The situation at Dunkirk becomes increasingly hopeless. After the rescue from Dunkirk, we are surprised and greatly relieved to find the lovers have been reunited--just what we hoped for.And then there was the scene with Vanessa Redgrave, set in the present. The hoped-for conclusion was just fiction, and the truth was tragic. But the creation of the fiction, which granted the characters their hopes and wishes, was the only way to correct the injustice which had been done to them. I saw this film a second time, after knowing its secrets, and I enjoyed it even more. The actors are uniformly excellent. James McAvoy is even better than excellent--notice the scene in the restaurant, when his shame is so great a burden that he does not even presume to look Cecelia in the eye. This is an outstanding film.",10,3,6,22 February 2008
V for Vendetta," Loved it
","I am not familiar with the source material, but I must say that I loved this film. It is amazingly thought-provoking, with some very depressing parallels to current situations.I discovered from the credits that Hugo Weaving did V. He is, of course, a terrific actor; but I was wondering if we were going to have a 'Darth Vader' situation where one actor does the voice and another the physical movement.I can't give the film a 10/10 because there were some serious questions: for example, was the final fit of special effects actually necessary, or just a bit of decorative iconoclasm? And I also question the likelihood of V putting the heroine through the rigors depicted in the middle of the film.However, despite the fact that the film has some rather spectacular killings, I never found the film to be gory or gruesome, and I thought the smiling Guy Fawkes mask was a perfect touch--no matter how dreadful the subject, or tearful the scene, V would be smilin' thru. However, I am eternally grateful (and consider this a spoiler) that we had no Phantom Of The Opera unmasking scene. I must confess that a good portion of the tension for me was whether the heroine was about to snatch the mask. But the viewer is allowed to use his or her imagination, which I think serves much better than any make-up might have. A film that is well-made, entertaining AND thought-provoking is a rare occurrence. Savor it.",8,1,4,21 March 2006
