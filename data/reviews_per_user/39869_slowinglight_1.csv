Your Name.," Among the best of its genre
","The quality of animation and sound design in Your Name rival the likes of Akira and Studio Ghibli as does the level of creativity in its cinematography. These are what allow the film to generate laughter and then tears in succession with no diminishing returns. Likewise, Your Name is one of those movies whose plot repeatedly defies expectations and whose premise the audience will not likely pin down until the credits are rolling.Written with love and captivatingly delivered, Makoto Shinkai has written a story that would be done a disservice were it described only as a Slice of Life; a genre that Japanese animated and live cinema have already redefined. It is a love story, an Epic, a coming of age story and a comedy. Above all Your Name is quintessentially Japanese. Shinkai effortlessly synthesises life in rural, traditional Japan with the Westernised cityscape of Tokyo, draws on shared tragedy and explores the dual natures of progress and the loss of one's history. Your Name also bridges the gap between mythology and science-fiction. The effect of this blend is not to contrive the plot or overshadow the characters but rather serve to help realise both.",9,2,4,29 January 2017
