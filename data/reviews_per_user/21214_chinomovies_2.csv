Walk the Line," 4 out of 10
","This is a movie about how a person (in this case a man) becomes a star, how he abuses of certain substances and how his life is a mess based on his 'dark' past and the destructiveness of fame. Does it sound familiar? Yes, there are 300 movies about this subject and they are all pretty much the same and this is just another one. It doesn't even matter if it's about Cash, Janis Joplin, Ray Charles or, let's say, Barry Manilow. So we are talking about an extremely conventional type of movie. Then let's talk about the movie itself... first of all is waaaaay too long (at least 40 minutes longer than it should be) and that's a big problem. Then the acting Joaquin: kinda good acting (well I'm not sure) and good singing... but too much singing!!! I would've loved two hours (and more) of real Cash but not that much singing from an impersonator. Reese, she does a really good and authentic... Reese. I mean, I really like her (I actually love her in 'Election'), but in WTL there's no real acting or challenge at all actually, her acting was exactly the same when she got the Oscar. So, 4/10 just because I could stand the 136 minutes (men!) without falling asleep.",4,0,5,13 March 2006
Crash," Pretentious, preachy and intellectually immature
","From the stupid 'angelical' new age soundtrack, to the excess of slow motion and situations 'to make you think' and 'to make you cry', this movie is so pretentious, pathetically preachy, and intellectually immature that I don't want to waste my time analyzing it. But just to fill the ten lines required, I would say that in 'Crash', Paul Haggis, writer and director, teach us about racial misunderstanding and wrong human behaviors based on prejudice. The story is about a multiracial group of extremely stereotypical characters passing each other in the night, to predictably meet later at the end in a melodramatic finale. Only in Hollywood (only in the US) it could have happened that such a mediocre movie gets not only good reviews but even an Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the year. As a person who loves cinema and who specially loves American cinema, I want to say that just the fact that the critics took this movie seriously makes me feel sad.",1,19,30,13 March 2006
