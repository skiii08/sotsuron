Casablanca," Fight against the Nazis
","This production was very very well made especially because it was all shot and made in the studio. The acting was very well played also, Michael Curtiz playing two characters was amazing and he did a very good job with it. Movies like this unfortunately don't seem to keep my attention as much as a comedy does. That is a personal preference, if you are into these types of movies then definitely go for it because it really was great. I'm still learning to appreciate the older movies as oppose to the newer ones because I am so used to the newer ones. You won't be disappointed with this movie but if you are someone who is really into comedy, it might not keep your attention as much!",8,0,2,14 March 2011
Citizen Kane," Man dies after not being trespassed
","This is a very touching movie, because he went through his whole life with a no trespassing sign on his fence. Some people go through their whole life just minding their own business and not being bothered by anyone. For me it would be very tough for me personally to do that, because honestly I am a nosy person. The film and production is very good and the acting is phenomenal. I respected this movie because when the news hit the world, people tried to find out more and more about his private life and why he lived so secluded. It was pretty cool how they flashed back to parts in his life and showed them that way instead of just hearing about them.",7,0,2,6 April 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," Hitch hiker gets out of prison
","This movie is by far one of my favorite movies before 1950. I feel like this was one of the best planned out movies before 1950, this was really planned out and the plot flowed very easily. This movie was very thought out and they did a very great job on the acting. The fact that he got in the car with the preacher and that they actually learn to get along. The whole movie was amazing and it will definitely stand out to me as the years go on. In my opinion it stuck out to me and I won't forget this movie because i feel like the acting was way better then the other movies even though it still had the same look as the older movies.",9,0,1,1 March 2011
The Exorcist," Horror Movie
","This movie was very very cruel. You could tell the code was not in affect with this movie with some of the scenes and the cruelty in the little girls voice when she is talking to the priest, and the things that are said while she is being possessed. Personally I thought some of the scenes were funny because of how cruel it got. Not because of what was happening, just because i was sitting there like 'wow is this really happening?' They go through the movie trying to help her. I will not ruin the movie but if you do not like cruelty, i would not watch this movie. I had no problem with the cruelty, and the acting was phenomenal i thought. They did a great job at displaying the exorcism.",7,0,1,9 May 2011
Annie Hall," Woody Allen Film
","This movie was alright to me. It was a drama filled movie i thought because when his marriage didn't work out, and him and his wife split up, he tried to get her back when she didn't want him. (typical boring story line). The movie wasn't THAT boring though for the story line i have seen more than once in movies. (Where people are trying to get the one they love back). The acting was pretty well acted, Woody Allen is an amazing actor, to me he is kind of goofy, I think the best word for it is goofy. He is very awkward to me, with the way he acts, maybe its because he looks goofy, but he is an amazing actor and the movie was OK at best.",8,0,0,9 May 2011
The Graduate," After the code
","The Graduate I thought was very funny. There were some pretty cool scenes in the movie where they stretched the code by far, very far. But its a good thing the code wasn't in affect. Some scenes in the movie were pretty dirty, but it was good. It was good to see movie directors doing what they wanted instead of being held back. The acting was really good and the movie was cracking me up with some of the things that were happening (I don't want to ruin anything) Mrs. Robinson was being very seductive to a man while she was married, but does Mr. Robinson wind up finding out? And what is the deal with Mrs. Robinson's daughter?",9,1,1,27 April 2011
Singin' in the Rain," First musical
","This is the first musical I think I have ever seen in my life, so I do not have much to compare it to but surprisingly I thought it was a really good movie. It kept my attention the whole time for a musical which was even surprising to me because I usually don't like movies like that because I think they are pretty corny, but honestly the moves they displayed in the movie with the umbrellas were pretty amazing because I don't know anyone in person who can do that. Haha, but seriously the movies they displayed were amazing and the camera angles and the different shots they took was unreal to me. Very great musical and nicely done!",9,0,1,6 April 2011
Psycho," Very good suspenseful movie.
","This was a very good movie to me, and honestly I picked this movie because of the name. I saw the name Psycho and thought, what can go wrong with this movie? Nothing went wrong. It was a very good movie and the filming and acting was very great. A movie that came out in 1960 was pretty decent filming. I could definitely see the advancement in the filming and the acting seemed to have gotten better since movies started coming out (obviously it was get better with higher budgets) I really liked the story line with money getting stolen and then the cops follows Marion, I will not ruin the movie but there was some really suspenseful parts in the movie. Very good movie, give it a shot!",8,0,0,6 April 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Jack Nicolson, enough said
","Jack Nicoloson is probably one of my favorite actors. He always says something that doesn't need to be said or something that shouldn't be said. This movie, when i saw it i was surprised at how much i liked it. Jack in all movies always seems to be playing mind games with people that will always fall for it. His acting is unbelievable and the camera scenes and the filming was amazing too. If you look at it from my perspective, you can kind of tell its an older movie, but if your someone who likes movies (before 1950, and has watched a lot of them) this movie looks very new. This is one of my favorite movies of all time and Jack does a great job acting.",10,1,2,27 April 2011
