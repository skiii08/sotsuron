Child 44," Disgusting butchery of a novel
","Please, do not watch this mediocre movie with fake Russian accent. Go read the book. This movie had cut out everything that matters to the story and makes it a deep one. Even if you don't read books, this one will probably still be interesting to you. I would honesty like to give it at least two stars, out of respect to actors who had to denounce their talents so that they do what has been done in this movie, but no. This is absolutely horrid misuse of a good story. I don't recommend anyone to loose time with watching this. And don't get me started with bad acting, B class camera and mildly horrible choice of music used in this so called movie. Other books have been made into films too, but rarely one had been so butchered like we have it here.",1,2,6,5 December 2015
Knives Out," Classic but fresh
","The movie really successfully, in my opinion, flirts with the old way of making who-did-it crime movies in a modern setting. Characters are not deeply developed, but are skillfully portrayed and viewer has not much to ask himself about the personality of each one - but it's not so shallow not to leave out space for mystery. Craig really surprised me well with how he carried out this subtly comedic role.Really pleasurable experience for having a nice afternoon with the movie.",9,1,5,9 February 2020
The Greatest Showman," Seriously?
","This could've been a great movie, if not for concept. With all due respect to anyone loving musicals, and overly romanticized stories: This could've been a movie about struggle, about being human, about flaws and rising above them, about success and failure, about... So many things. But what it is - it's some producer's idea that 'we didn't have a musical in ages, this would be cool to produce as a musical'. And I don't care about people fainting over 'though guy can sing' - everywhere where there could've been great writing, great acting and great character development - there's a song. And not a very good one. This is below mediocre, and it's 4/10 because camera, costumes and few other things are decent. Otherwise it'd be 1. Acting is found in traces here. This is not a movie, this is not a musical, this is waste of money.",4,2,3,3 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," If Oscar was worth anything, this movie would have couple
","This is a movie that will tell you a story about a tragedy trough comedy. It will make you remember you know how to laugh, even tho' your tears are still on your cheeks. And it's an amazing movie.",10,1,3,29 December 2019
