Casablanca," Casablanca
","To the director Curtiz you did an amazing job on this film Casablanca. The story written is just unique and i absolutely enjoyed the film. i like all the turns in the film, have you thinking one thing and then before you know it something else happens that catches you off guard. i do a good job of seeing how films are going to turn out but with this one i couldn't. the storytelling was off the charts, the rising action and climax. the actors did a really good job as well, i just loved everything about this film. it was a true story that could really happen to anyone. i liked how you used the WWII with it too. this film relates to me in a way that i understand. its hard trusting people, you cant jump to conclusions. i learned that in this film, it really stood out to me because Rick had all the right in the world to feel what he felt about Ilsa. Ilsa had no excuse and i was agreeing with Rick. but after she told the story about what happened and why she wasn't on the train it made a lot of sense, and i understand why. man once again i just commend you on this film. you turned a negative into a positive, I'm sure people loved watching this to take their mind off the current situation that was going on. smart move. this was all about sacrifice and you will do dang near anything for the people you love. i really respect Rick for what he did, at first he was all about himself but at the end of the movie saved a lot of people. he was considerate of not only himself but of other people as well. Curtiz job well done, i am well pleased with this film. my favorite film that i have seen thus far in my class.",Null,1,2,26 September 2011
