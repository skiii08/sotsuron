The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Kinda Lame
","'Besides shooting an arrow at a jet which is shown in the trailer all Katniss really does is Propaganda Commercials and cry over things' Said best by another reviewer Daniel.It's boring. I got up to get a drink 3 times just to get over the boredom. I got really tired of Jennifer Lawrence's piercing stare and crying fits. The whole movie is one self aggrandizing infomercial about joining the rebellion. There is very little to like about the movie. It is nothing like when the games are going on. I would like to write more about how bad it is but I just draw a blank. It's a forgettable movie, probably best remembered as Phillip Seymore Hoffman's last film.",3,24,34,29 November 2014
