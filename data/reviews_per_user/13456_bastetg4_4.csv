Lucky Number Slevin," Derivative and boring
","The dialogue was laughably bad, and the acting (from some of the best in the biz) was sub-par for the most part. I recognize this is a 'thriller' and that doesn't always mean good dialogue, but there were far too many lengthy pseudo-intellectual scenes with no action to excuse bad dialogue. Oh, and of course, a chess game--the universal symbol for a complex sub-plot. I did enjoy Hartnett's character, but when I can see the end coming from a mile away it really takes a lot out of the movie for me. The ending was far too much like The Usual Suspects without being nearly as surprising or complex. If you see it free, like I did, it's not that bad, but don't waste money on it.",4,11,27,10 March 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," This is what filmmaking should be.
","If every other movie of 2000 had been miserable, this film alone would have redeemed the entire year.  I have never seen such an amazing film.  The locations, the cast, the action sequences, the sets, the theme - all so beautiful you want to weep for sheer joy - that is, when you aren't laughing out loud at the audacity of the sequences.  This is what filmmaking should be, and it is easily the best film Ang Lee has ever done.Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a timeless story of achingly beautiful magical realism.  The film seems to have something for everyone; battles to the death, intrigue, revenge, 2 epic love stories, humor, excellent acting and majestic filming.  And for those of you with a feminist bent, there is nothing better than seeing a 16 year old girl beat the pants off of a bar-full of trained assassins, mocking them as she goes.  In the final big fight scene between the female leads, I believe they manage to showcase every weapon known to a Chinese warrior.The fight scenes were so fast-paced that I have already vowed to see the movie again, to better appreciate all of the fancy foot and handwork going on.  But I want to see it again anyway - how often do you find yourself saying, 'Wow,' as the screen goes black and the credits start to roll?",10,0,0,20 January 2001
Shrek," Can't remember the last time I laughed so hard in a theater.
","I think the first thing I need to say is that normally, I don't like toilet humor.  Fart jokes and nose-picking are the kind of things that keep me away from a lot of 'comedies.'  There *was* a lot of that in Shrek, and yet... most of it was funny.  There's such an overall feeling of irreverence in the film that I surprised myself by laughing at that very humor, because it seemed to fit.  Maybe it's the knowledge that you will *NEVER* see a character in a Disney film put out a fire by peeing on it that makes it so delicious.  Speaking of the Evil Empire, I noticed that several reviewers considered the regular stream of Disney-knocking to be a drawback. Personally, those were the jokes I laughed at the hardest.
There are 2 sides to how I feel about Disney, sort of a love/hate thing - I love most of their products, but I hate who they are.  I grew up on Disney animation, and still hold many of their films dear to my heart.  I also lived most of my life within a 2 hour drive of the Magic Kingdom and have spent more than my fair share of time there, so I think I know more about Disney the corporation than your average American.  Frankly, they're a little scary with their, 'You'll be happy, it'll be magical, or else!' attitude, which is what makes Shrek so funny.  There were sendups of several other well-known and well-loved films, but the Disney jokes were the best. I think you have to love Disney and have a first-hand knowledge of the Disney experience to really appreciate those lampoons to the fullest.
I haven't said anything about the effects yet, but of course they were amazing.  Shrek truly leaves all other animation, not just Disney, in the dust.  It's the first animated film I've seen that really takes advantage of the technology currently available - it doesn't just pan in and out of scenes, it's three-dimensional, and pages crackle and light refracts, and characters move naturally.  It was impressive, especially when compared to the trailer that showed right before Shrek started - Disney's Atlantis comes out in 2 weeks, and it looks like formulaic, flat, 2D Disney.  Disney takes the same amount of time to develop a film, but they're clearly stuck in a rigid design mold - dig up a legend to animate, insert storyline here, drop in cute characters there, get famous singer to do theme song, ta-da! another blockbuster.The final great thing about Shrek was that they turned the typical dreamy animated love quest on it's ear.  As a woman, I'm thrilled to see more and more anti-fairy tales making it to the theater.  Sure, you could say that it's been done, and you'd be right, but it hasn't come near to being done to death as much as the 'typical' fairy tale love story.  As far as I'm concerned, make anti-fairy tales until the adults want to puke - little kids can use as much reverse gender-stereotyping as possible.  Here's to burping princesses who get involved in their own rescuing!",10,0,0,19 May 2001
Gladiator," 3, count 'em, 3 writers on the screenplay!
","If for some reason you are forced to see this movie (heavy sedation and the like), the costuming was sensational and the soundtrack is fantastic - try to focus on that.Otherwise,the plot (!) is cumbersome, the excessive violence is tedious, the paranoid emperor thing is boring and the hero against all odds has been done to death.Not even Derek Jacobi and Russell Crowe could carry this albatross.",3,0,2,7 May 2000
