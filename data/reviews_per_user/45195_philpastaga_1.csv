Marie Antoinette," Is there a message ?
","I don't want to enter into the historical debate. This film is not a historical movie. By the way it is quite funny to see the new attitude of Sofia Coppola not insisting too much now on her 'certain vision of Marie Antoinette real life'. Anyway, my comment is not there but on the movie in itself. What was the message ? Where is the scenario ? Why using the real Castle of Versailles if at the end Sofia did not make any effort on the quality of her technique : nothing on the colours (outside the poor scene on the 'sunrise close to the lake'), nothing on the image (I don't ask for a genius work on each scene but at least where is the novelty created in Virgin and Lost in Traslation). Where is the Sofia's touch ?????? In the flows of champagne, the excess of pink and the amount of cakes ? Boring, a long and boring suite of Vogue and Variety articles. Actors are so ridiculous because too much somes caricatures that you cannot believe in the story, get inside, share a certain idea of a teenager life... Nothing ... empty... from the beginning to the end. At least thank you Sofia for all the money spent for our Castle of Versailles museum... it will be used better. Americans are the biggest private contributors to our dear monument (and thousand thanks for that)but in general they prefer to organize dinners not stupid movies :=))))). One lesson from that movie ? Yes ! Real life (and real history) is much more interesting that this huge artistic error !!",1,39,76,3 June 2006
