Sucker Punch," After watching it, i feel...
","This movie gives me ambivalent feelings. It has excellent technical aspects, as one would expect from Zack Snyder, but i rather more enjoyed the LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS than this one, which although was an animated one about owls, had more story and worthy visual effects than this one. Mistake me not - the FX in this movie are super cool,and the eye-candy kicking their way through the plot are well worth it. But it is the plot that i cannot grasp. The director has definitely succeeded in blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, and you do get to understand the way things go even though it appears to be fantasy, which is the basis of this film ( as per tag line and storyline, a girl dreams of other things to plot of escape in a very glum asylum) However, after sitting for nearly 2 hours with this one, i can't keep wondering...what's the point of this film??",5,59,124,17 June 2011
