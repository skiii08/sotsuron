Sucker Punch," Deeper than expected, with awe-inspiring effects
","When I first saw posters for this movie, my first impression was 'Hot girls fighting against robots and other grunts, this is going to be an amusing yet shallow movie, but great fun'. So me and my friends went to the theatre to see this movie, expecting basically a war-ish kind of movie with an unimportant plot, and the first few minutes of the movie completely astounded me. A touching first scene, in black and white dealing with matters such as death, rape and loss in a sensitive way, as well as injustice. The fact that there was almost no dialogue and a great song definitely made the scene more impacting. The sudden jump to what appeared to be a porn shoot was definitely surprising and frankly confused me to bits, as did the next scene when she ends up in a Chinese pagoda. The action in the movie was solid, and after a while it was easy to get used to skipping between these worlds. As great as the action and the acting was, there definitely were plot holes, such as why Babydoll would leave evidence in the dressing room, but nothing too damaging. The story ties itself off quite well, and mixed with beautiful scenery, excellent effects, and quick-paced action makes for a great movie. In conclusion, a great guy movie, which girls could also enjoy but maybe not as much as men would. It has a pretty good plot, a nice ending and great action scenes,not to mention the good choice in music and the general look of the scenery, outfits, etc.",8,5,11,3 April 2011
