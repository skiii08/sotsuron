The Ring," SCARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","The Ring was the scariest movie I have ever seen in my entire life! It's a great movie, but dang it's a scary one. I was scared to death when I got home that night. I thought I would see that girl. Ooshhhh... I get so scared thinking about it. I give it my highest recomendation if your wanting to be scared and stay scared for a while. If you do watch it, watch it in the dark!!!!!!",Null,0,0,9 November 2002
