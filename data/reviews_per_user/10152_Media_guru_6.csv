The Ring," WOW!
","That is all I have to say after watching the Ring! The plot is great. After the funeral of her niece, Rachel Keller decides to investigate what seems to be a chain of death. Upon retiving clues she watches a mystious video and learns (from a chilling phone call) that she has seven days to live. this drives her on a rampage of solving the mystery and saving her and her son's life. I didn't find the movie scary because I was a vitim of spoilers, but it was exciting enough for me to enjoy. That starts to dwindle it gets a little boring and some parts seem like the cutting crew was asleep. But other than that the movie was suspenseful and cool. I recommend it.",Null,1,1,11 March 2003
Lilo & Stitch," Mazzy fun!
",if there is one thing I love about some Disney movies today is the level of realism involved as opposed to my day I went with three other people around my age and found we laughed more than my seven year old niece but it still is a movie for children which makes it so good. the movie is about a little girl with an attitude named Lilo and her equally mind-set sister nani shortly after lilo wishes for a pet enters stich lilo instantly falls in love with the destrucive animal only to discover he's a hawaiian space dog sent to destroy the earth. this movie also adds the sorrow of custody woes some children may find to sad but this is otherwise a good movie for kids and adults (with kids),Null,1,1,4 July 2002
Spider-Man," Oh Yeah... This Rocks!
",I Absolutely LOVED this movie! It lacks no interest through out the whole thing! it's great from the very beginning and Tobey is adorable! I highly suggest this movie to anyone! after seeing it you will certainly learn what all the 'hype' is about! I hope to see this one again!,10,0,0,8 May 2002
Men in Black II," not to disapoint
","If you liked the frist MIB, you should like this one. It is full of the same types of jokes and charaterization. Now, some may think that is a bad thing but I loved it. you should, however, watch the first one first, so you understand some of the jokes. A big percentage of the first movie's greatness is Will Smith's charachter, and that is no diffrent in this one. So if you enjoyed the frist movie, the second is recomendeed.",Null,0,1,10 March 2003
8 Mile," POWERFUL!
","Once you get past all the lingo, 8 mile is one powerful peice of work! loosely based on his own life, conserversal Eminem stars as Jimmy Smith J.R. Making his was through his life anyway he can, dispite horrible curcimstances. occasnally attending 'rap battles' to help him get further.Em defeats the singer = bad actor rule in this raw drama, somthing Britney Spears and Madonna have failed to do before Alhough it's not for everybody, pepole who hate Eminem will hate this movie but if you can get past that you will see that it is so exellent ot is acually award-worthy",Null,0,0,29 March 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Another Burton gem
","Tim Burton fans are not to be disappointed with his latest unique tale. Charlie Bucket is a happy, polite boy despite the fact his family is poor. When Willy Wonka announces he will be giving away tours to his legendary chocolate factory, Charlie dreams of how nice it would be on actually win. The golden tickets are found speedily by children around the world evaporating Charlie's hope, but in a luck only found the the movies Charile find money in a snow bank and rushes to by one more chocolate bar-of course he wins-if this wasn't intended for children I would have been a horrible 'convenice' but since the script is kid friendly, it was just cute. Enter Willy Wonka (the freakishly talented Johnny Depp)who's clever one-liners make the film He gives the winners the promised tour where all except Charlie fall victim to fun ploys suited to their chief sin.Like all Burton films, Charlie is an artistic masterpiece and the script is anything but a corny children's film.(although I see no problem in bringing a child) The kids are just nasty enough for a comedic effect with out getting annoying and Charlie is the ultimate protagonist and makes me want to have an impoverished Engiish boy-Highly recommended",Null,3,4,2 August 2005
