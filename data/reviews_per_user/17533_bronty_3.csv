Scarface," What's worse: the film or Pacino?
","Having seen this over 20 years ago on cable, I recently decided to see if the ensuing decades could make me appreciate this, and the answer is 'NO'. I thought then, and think now, that the film overall and its lead performer were and are over-hyped to the point of hysteria. I even call into deep question Pacino's standing as one of America's 'great' actors; for all those who love 'The Godfather' series (I'm not one of them: I think they, too, were equally overdone), I suggest taking a gander at such 'classics' as 'Author! Author!' (ever wonder why he doesn't do more comedy? A quick glance at THIS will tell you why). In the hands of the unreliable De Palma - for every 'Carrie', you get 'The Fury' - a man who, despite his blatant desire and attempts to be Hitchcock reborn, is at heart a lover of the overblown cinematic image, Pacino is allowed to give his tiresome ticks and actor's tricks full display in a part that SHOULD have been played with subtlety. If the film is watchable - and it basically is NOT - it is due to the scenery-chewing; Pacino hardly starts with nibbling; no, instead he swallows each shot whole, inspiring his fellow actors to go overboard along with him. For each laugh one has at the actors' expense, however, one needn't be Cuban to be even slightly offended: SURELY the makers of this film could have found more than ONE honest-to-goodness Cuban (co-star Steven Bauer being it). The accents, particularly Pacino and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, are akin to those in the old 'Speedy Gonzalez' cartoons - you almost expect poor old Juan Valdez to be trotted out, too, just for good measure. But how about the story-telling, the technical aspects? Well...once you get past the hammy performances - quite a struggle, believe me (you'll be tempted to bring out the cloves and pineapple) - and the assuredly overcooked direction, you are left with something that rambles on for nearly 3 hours, though with little reason beyond wanting to become a modern-day 'epic saga' a la 'The Godfather'. As for the LOOK of the film, it's not an especially attractive one: the print on cable - no, I haven't seen the DVD and don't care to - STILL looks downright muddy at points, as if copied from an old slow-speed video tape, though this could be as much to do with pan-and-scan as anything else. The much-lauded score by Giorgio Moroder is, THERE: not memorable, as with 'Midnight Express', but not a total failure and it DOES fit the cool, shiny-plastic beauty of Miami and its denizens as shown in this film (everyone seems to be dipped in either oil - the 'natural look' apparently never made it down in Florida - or sweat, for Pacino never seems to stop perspiring, which is understandable, what with the effort it must have taken to overact AND speak with some marble-mouthed, faux-Latin accent). No matter, though, what the film looks like, or how it's written (poorly; example: Michelle Pfeiffer, sporting one of her other noses, just disappears towards the end), or how long it goes on (and on, and ON, AND ON...), people watch this for the acting, the violence, and the love of the 'f' word (uttered 182 times), and they have dubbed this and 'The Godfather' as 'classics', all of which goes to show that if you say it long enough, some people believe it.",2,27,56,5 December 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Passionless, cookie-cutter, derivative & dull
","First and foremost, if they couldn't get James Cameron on board to helm a second sequel to 'The Terminator', they just shouldn't have bothered, but this is Hollywood and so they pressed on, engaging the services of one Jonathan Morrow, a director you've never heard of before and aren't likely to hear of again anytime soon: simply put, this is ONE LOUSY DIRECTOR! True, no one is ever going to accuse the first two films of being part of the greatest movies ever made, and while I enjoyed the first (it was what it was: fun and creepy, even) and hated the second (too full of itself, too full of its own supposed 'importance', it's James 'King of the World' Cameron's overbloated message movie saying 'war is wrong!'. This just in), one can say at the very least they both had a passion, that whatever their faults the director, his stars, the screenwriter, etc., BELIEVED IN IT. Not this time, baby: from the word 'go', there isn't an original thought or idea on display, either behind or in front of the cameras, and it even goes so far as to rip its own franchise off, and not too well, either. James Cameron supposedly didn't want to do this film because he felt, correctly, that 'T2' completed the story, and so THIS film becomes one predictable rehash of everything you've seen before, and NOT just in 'The Terminator' movies: if you've seen even just a handful of action flicks, especially in the last few years, you'll be hard-pressed not to accurately guess what happens in each scene, or each shot, right down to the FX, which, after 'T2', are also derivative and seem...been-there-done-that. One could hope that its stars might make up for the director's deficiencies but that's a lost cause, too: Nick Stahl, a not-untalented young actor, assumes the role of John Connor from Edward Furlong but doesn't have Furlong's sense of star-crossed vulnerability - he merely comes off cocky, and aware at every moment he's taken over a role ill-suited to him; as for the always-angst-ridden Claire Danes (seriously in danger of becoming this era's Jennifer Jason Leigh if she doesn't make a film in which she's happy, laughs, smiles, breaks wind, whatever!), she has the thankless task of replacing Linda Hamilton (this is driven home in one unintentionally funny moment when, in all seriousness, not long after Danes learns she and Stahl will be man and wife in the future and she's grabbed a gun and mowed down a machine-on-the-loose, Stahl says, 'You remind of my mother', which gives proof that this film is not only written by a man but by a man who doesn't understand the first thing about women. I dare ANY man to say those words - 'You remind me of my mother' - to a woman he likes or loves, then sit back and ruminate the possibility of a long, LONG, lonely existence.) Unfortunately, Danes has about 2 expressions: despair and disbelief. Both of these are understandable reactions to learning there are actual robotic lifeforms running amok in L.A. (as opposed to those making films like this), but her performance is wearing. HOWEVER, at least she GIVES a performance, unlike the Barbie doll chosen to be the Big Bad Terminator: for his role in 'T2', Robert Patrick says he perfected his creepy, shark-like stare by studying birds of prey, and he was entirely successful in instilling fear; the young actress here (OK, so I forget her name - it isn't all that important since I seriously doubt you'll be hearing much about her) resembles nothing more than the over-blonde love child of Christina Ricci and Jamie Pressly, all work-the-runway supermodel swagger and pout, and ZERO menace; her attempts at trying to be 'fearsome' - which consists of nothing more than lowering her chin and trying to stare through her tweezed eyebrows with her perfectly made-up eyes (apparently, in this terrible future, cyborgs - in addition to being the perfect killing machine - are also learned disciples of Estee Lauder) - are, at best, ridiculous, and often faintly hilarious. As for Arnold, well, all the concealer and pancake make-up in the world cannot hide what the camera makes GLARINGLY OBVIOUS: he's a little long-in-the-tooth for this kind of thing. At times, he practically seems to have been dipped in formaldehyde: you'll notice AT NO TIME is ANY strong light upon his face in ANYTHING but distant shots (where it may not be him, anyway), and all close-ups seem oddly darkened (Elizabeth Taylor used that trick, too: a black stocking over the lens to smooth out any tell-tale lines.) His appearance also smacks of desperation, reaching back to a role that he thought might put him back on top, after a grueling period where seemingly every film he'd made disappeared nearly without a trace. Actually, that, more than anything else, is what is wrong with this movie: the stink of desperation. Come to think of it, that ISN'T the worst thing; no...worse yet is that all concerned have succeeded in making an action film that's not just lifeless, it's dead-on-arrival.",1,7,13,12 June 2004
The Replacements," The sound of one hand clapping
","How's THIS for originality: a down-on-his-luck team owner recruits a bunch of 'wacky' and 'lovable' losers and misfits (are there any other kind?) who 'miraculously' band together and not only make a team...they make (sniff) a family. But since this a 'man's' movie, full of p**s-n-vinegar (yeah, they wish!), they're not supposed to be so much of a family as a bunch o' buddies, lest anyone accuse them of being weak (hell, no!) or pansies (god forbid!) In the annals (for the illiterate, that has nothing to do with anyone's butt) of cinema, there have been a good number of sports-themed comedies: 'Bull Durham', 'Slap Shot', 'The Bad News Bears', just to name a few, and while they, too, may hardly have been original, they at least WERE what comedies are SUPPOSED TO BE: funny. In the course of nearly two hours, there wasn't a single honest-to-goodness laugh. Hell, there wasn't even a moment that brought a grin! The hard part (other than why this was made in the first place) is where to lay the blame; the possibilities are endless. Let's start with Keanu Reeves: there's a reason why he's in not featured in too many comedies and that reason is the guy just ain't funny. And let's face facts: he can't act. Here, he is comatose, expressionless, with line readings that can only be called robotic. And do YOU see HIM as a quarterback? Talk about miscast! Next is the writing - no cliche is left unturned: will the former quarterback (Reeves) join the team? will he fall in love with the token female in the movie? will there a be a character who is hard-drinkin' and a wise-ass? will there be a sensitive moment when the coach tells the quarterback that he's the only one who really loves the game? I could spend hours telling of every overworked theme that's made its way into the movie; the sad part is that that would still be more entertaining than this dreck. And how 'bout those supproting players...not only do you get THREE - count 'em: THREE! - blubbery fat guys (numerous shots of their bulging bellies - isn't that funny?), but two are black and the other's Japanese, which provides countless laffs as they bounce racial slurs back and forth. Boy, there hasn't been THIS level of hilarity since the OJ trial! And, fresh from his annoying 7-Up commercials, Orlando Jones is featured in a role that is, essentially, 'the girly-boy': not only does he hide during the inevitable barroom fight scene, but he's also pretty fond of 'I Will Survive'; still, to prove he's 'all man', the filmmakers provide a few shots of him dancing suggestively with some blonde floozy. (Minus the dirty dancing, it could easily be Stepin Fetchit.) Jon Favreau portrays a the kind of character usually given a name like Killer or Meat: the snarling - but wacky-n-lovable! - he-beast. He is, in one word, an embarrassment. Not for a single moment is he believable. The worst fate is reserved for Gene Hackman, who is slumming here; he performs every scene lackadaisically, as if his heart just ain't in it. I certainly hope he was paid handsomely. I certainly hope it was worth it. Continuing to put the blame where it belongs, special mention must be made of the director, Howard Deutch, a man who hasn't helmed a worthwhile film other than 'Grumpier Old Men'; as with his other attempts at directing, this film is jumbled and at times incoherent - often, it's downright confusing as to just where this film is going (answer: nowhere) and what he's trying to say (the only clear message we get is this: rich=bad, poor=good, exemplified by the cartoonish pro players who go on strike to earn more millions and the even-more-cartoonish scabs who make up this motley crew whom we're supposed to be rooting for). Whole scenes go absolutely nowhere, a problem not exactly helped by editing that appears to have been handled by someone blind wielding a garden shears; numerous, useless shots seem thrown in blindly to pad an already-too-long movie. And then there's the photography: this is one UGLY looking film! I think there was an attempt to give the film a somewhat 'gritty' look but it serves only to make all involved seem vaguely unwashed. No, they look - well - skanky. (Which I suppose is only fitting for a story about a bunch of losers.) Keanu comes off the worst: either he's gettin' a little long-in-the-tooth or it just looks that way; throughout the entire affair, it appears he's just come off a long, long bender. Which might be a pretty good idea, now that I think about it; maybe if I had a few stiff drinks I could forget I wasted my energy on this c**p.",1,2,7,14 August 2000
