Black Swan," Not Good.
","This author says what I want too. (William C. White) What this film lacks is any sense of balance. Certain works of art are painful, and that's very necessary and natural. But when a work is dark, it must,MUST have moments of joy and lightness in order to succeed. 'Black Swan' starts in a dark place just gets darker and darker as it goes along.Plus, how much clunkier can an exposition get? 'You all know the story of Swan Lake' but I'm going to tell it anyway. Vincent Cassel was quite decent in this movie, but the script he had to work with was abysmal. Same goes for Natalie Portman, though she did have the one really decent scene.Overall, this movie went well beyond just being naive and childish: it was terribly vulgar in my opinion. Egregious, and without any point. If a piece is meant to be painful, I'd like to be able to revel in the pain a bit – sort of like when you feel a canker sore with your tongue. This movie was more like amputating your own foot.",1,5,9,6 February 2012
