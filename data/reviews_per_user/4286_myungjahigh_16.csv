Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," whole new sherlock
","I like it better than the first one. When I saw the first one, i didn't feel familiar with sherlock described in the movie because the character is much focused on his fighting skill and ability, not like original Sherlock in the books. But after it, I guess I got more comfortable with the new created Sherlock's character, because I really enjoyed the second series. And I found new type of Sherlock is also lovable. 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows' has its own color and interpretation which is different from the original works.The main actors did good job. Robert Downey Jr. so goes with Sherlock Holmes who is good at disguising and playing games, and Jude Law is perfect John Watson. Whom I like most is Colonel Sebastian Moran, acted by Paul Anderson. It was so cool to see him shoot, chase, run...hope there will be more series of this film.",6,2,4,8 March 2012
The Hunger Games," It was pretty good for me
","I've never read the original books before, and I enjoyed this movie. I had not expected that much about the movie... maybe that's why I found it fun during the running time. Still, I am satisfied with the movie and it makes me want to read books. I heard there are some people who argue that The Hunger Games actually stole the idea from Japanese literature and movie called Battle Royale. I am a huge fan of Battle Royale, and I also think the idea of 'killing' game is quite similar. However, it looks hard to say that The Hunger Games copied the idea of Battle Royale. People killing others in order to survive is a common theme in literary or media works, I guess. And The Hunger Games and Battle Royale are entirely different films. While watching this movie, I thought that the audiences from Panem are similar to people of the real world including myself. They are eager to watch more horrible and provocative things in media. It's getting worse in these days. Also, I felt that the world in the film is not that different from real. District 1, a strong one, already established the structured and well organized system to make its own weapon. In contrary, a weak District 12 cannot help but participate the games for living. And the Panem which takes control over the districts looks just hideous even though it is decorated with colorful stuff. I sympathized with the movie in terms of these points.Anyhow, I think the movie The Hunger Games is enjoyable enough. It is thrilling, and it's too terrible to imagine... I am waiting for the next series, and I'd like to read the books.",7,1,7,11 April 2012
Once," made me trip to Ireland
","Whenever I watch Once, I'm always moved by the beautiful musics, places, story, and so on. Most of all, the musics and Ireland described in Once are just incredible. I still remember the scenery and people of Once by listening to all musics in it. And this movie is the reason why i decided to go on a trip to Ireland. I visited Dublin and Killiney, and got inspired a lot. dropped by the spot where Glenn played guitar and first met Marketa. There were lots of musicians who are very passionate about musics. The street was full of joy and passion toward arts. The movie just describes the usual and real Ireland as it is. i think this is why Once got loved by a number of people from different countries. Oh and there is one thing i really want to mention. The Swell Season held a concert in Seoul around in 2009, and i was there. Before the concert starts, there was one korean independent band throwing their own small gig in front of the concert hall. It might be a kind of contribution toward the swell season, cause they played musics from Once. most people did not much care about them. Soon the concert started, and The Swell Season made their stages. After a few musics, they suddenly introduced the korean band to the audience and let them play on the real stage.. The Swell Season might have heard about them right before the concert and have been impressed, i guess. The band played its own song for a number of audiences, and the band looked so happy about it. And Last year, i found one article on a newspaper that the band made the independent film dealing with their amazing story about them having a chance to play on the real stage at The Swell Season concert, and the film was about to release.. I was stunned again with the thought that Once actually have inspired people all over the world. The Swell Season and Once probably got the band an 'once in a life time' experience. I must say that Once is truly beautiful because of that.",9,4,4,28 February 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," confusing but interesting
","While watching the movie, I was so confused to understand how the story goes. Also, as a foreign audience, i had some troubles to remember and tell the characters' last names, first names, secret code names, etc. I had not read the books, and maybe that's the reason why i felt this film is quite hard to follow... my brain went through the tough time.However, I also think that it is very worth to watch it, because I might have unconsciously felt that movies on spy are supposed to be splendid and full of visually thrilling stuff. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy actually broke the stereotype, and i'm grateful. Besides, in fact there are lots of scenes which make my palms sweaty even though the movies go so calm and silent all the time. This is very interesting and brilliant. I think this movie is one you should watch if interested in spy genres. Though the movie seems to struggle to carry the whole story of books in it, i would like to applaud the director and the writer for their talents in telling the story. Also, all the actors did so great jobs in this film. I loved their works.",7,1,2,28 February 2012
Watchmen," so good
","This is a different kind of movie on heroes. Whenever think about heroes and their powers, all I could have in my mind is saving the earth, defeating villains, winning peace and love. But for Watchmen, everything is disrupted and blurred. It's apocalyptic and tragic on the one hand, and very human or even subhuman on the other. Heroes who are supposed to help people are not able to do it due to their individual reasons. The world is getting dark and desperate, and heroes are getting to lose powers.Watchmen is very huge and enormous, because it deals with many prominent events in human history. It is even philosophical, and makes people think about human beings themselves. The best character for me is Rorschach. I don't know exactly why, but I am just attracted to him. I guess it is because he is only right one in this movie, although he is considered freak and weirdo all the time. What he says and shows in his journal always impresses me a lot. Rorschach is my all time favorite hero ever. Also, I really like Jackie Earle Haley's performance. He is a great actor. His voice and every step he makes were Rorschach itself. After watching the movie Watchmen, I read the original graphic novel. I think both movie and novel are great. It could have been so hard to carry the huge graphic novel into the movie genre, but it is nicely done.",7,4,7,19 March 2012
Hugo," masterpiece
","Tribute to Georges Melies, who opened the door to the world of imagination A few months ago, I mean, before Hugo and The Artist were released, it seemed very common that people just looked for more special effects or more provocative films and the film industry supported it. Meanwhile, The Artist and Hugo were shown to the public. Both the two are very special at this moment, because they are dealing with the film industry of the past which was not like these days at all. no special effect, no spectacle, not even voice nor color. And both of them did splendid jobs at Academy awards.Hugo, which is made with terrific 3D technology, impresses the audiences as the first movie of human history did. The reason why Hugo is such brilliant is not only because of its technology, but also its imagination and reminisce that it supplies. I think Hugo is dedicated to people who still believe that every imagination and film could be realized... just like the old days of 'A Trip to the Moon.'Lumière said that there is no future for films, but actually films have developed brightly. I would say that the development was possible because of various imagination and ideas of people. Of course technology and money also have had powers. The question is, will there be future for films anymore? What Lumière mentioned about film and technology was not totally wrong, because it was the era before A Trip to the Moon, the new film era of imagination. It is probably not coincidence that The Artist and Hugo came up at this time. I am sure there will be future for movies if they have own imaginative powers. and if they don't only depend on technology and capital.Hugo says that every single person, every single thing has its own purpose. And through the movie Hugo, it seems fixed where films must go, and what purposes they are supposed to keep.",10,3,7,7 March 2012
The Intouchables," incredibly funny and heart warming
","In these days, in my country, the movie Intouchables is ranked very high in box office. Usually French films are not that popular or familiar in this country's movie industry. Therefore it is quite surprising to see that people are very eager to see Intouchables, a film from France. At first, it was not famous to people at all because promotions were not big for the movie. However, as time goes by, Intouchables is getting bigger and bigger. Almost every person who watched the movie tells to friends or writes review on the internet that Untouchables is a amazing film. And I think that is a real and successful marketing.I also watched it today, and I definitely recommend this film just like others did to me. So fun, moving, beautiful. While watching the movie, the audiences including me burst into laughter or tears for every single second. very priceless moment.",9,8,16,31 March 2012
Kick-Ass," fun movie
","Kick-Ass is definitely a funny movie. And somewhat special, when it comes to say about hero movies. This film starts with the simple hypothesis: what if I become a superhero? And Kick-Ass gives the answer for that with hilarious and cool actions. Hero from YouTube generation would be like this.I didn't try to find any lesson in this movie. I just wanted to watch something that could make me feel good and happy, and I made a right choice. Also, what I like about this movie is that all the scenes and figures are described fantastically. Especially sound effects and sound tracks are awesome! The eminent part of Kick-Ass goes to Hit Girl, I think. She is the best character in this movie, or maybe the best female hero.",7,1,3,9 April 2012
The Nightmare Before Christmas," extraordinary
","Every single thing has its principle and purpose. I think The Nightmare before Christmas is profound which discerns this society... not only Halloween and Christmas.When Santa said Happy Halloween at the end of the movie, I was impressed so much. Everything goes back where it belongs, and that is very relieving and peaceful. Conversely, it is a violence to deprive and invade others. A lot of wars that occurred in the past because there was no respect for other cultures. It still happens even until now. In this movie, the relations between cultures, countries, or ideologies could be parallel to the relation of Halloween and Christmas. The two holidays respect each other, and then perfect peace and stability come. The characters in The Nightmare before Christmas are equally lovable. very creative and well made. I first watched this about 12 years ago, and watched again in 2006 with 3D. Add, yesterday one more. Each time I felt somewhat differently, and each time I love more.",8,2,2,30 March 2012
Drag Me to Hell," original, fun, and scary
","This movie is so rare, unique, it has its own style. I would say that Drag Me to Hell is pretty scary and horrifying enough to watch. There are many stuffs which you can easily find in other scary films, such as curse, screaming, a ghost popping out where you wouldn't expect it to be. The movie seems like it well follows the formulations and laws for its genre. However, it is different and special at the same time. It is very fun and even hilarious. I literally laughed a lot throughout the film, and that's what I liked most about Drag Me to Hell. It constructs the horror things, and it also destroys them repeatedly. I think it's so creative. I've never thought I could laugh while watching horror films before this film. Drag Me to Hell just wins both scary and fun.new and different style, and you will get unexpected joy from it. this is actually one of my favorite horror films ever!",7,1,2,25 March 2012
The Artist," amazing
","It is a great film. I think the director absolutely deserves the Oscar. All other factors are surely important when it comes to movies, but especially, The Artist makes me believe that editing takes a really huge part in movies.. I don't know about editing because i have never studied, but here's some points I liked about the editing of The Artist. When Geroge dreams about him getting start to hear everything beside his voice, I was just stunned while watching it. I could feel almost everything at once. his feelings, his fear, and even about the era when the silent film days were replaced. It was amazing to see how the movie describes the era and history. Furthermore, i was also impressed when George met Peppy at the company and walked down the stairs while Peppy went to the opposite side. The entire set of stairs and people ascending and descending looks like the life of people to me. George went down the stairs among a lot of people as if he walked out with the past. The scene was so great.I want to say you should watch this film. it is so heart warming and moved. It helps to take a rest a little bit for people who are tired of visually splendid and wordy things. The silence of this film is filled with audiences' laugh, sigh, and others, just like the audiences did within the film. I think it is needed to hear the real story and heart of films instead of technical effects for a while.",9,4,9,27 February 2012
Up," absolutely beautiful
","Pixa is literally brilliant. Creative ideas, advanced technology, ability to tell the story, all is great. Even before the movie really started, I was already deeply moved by the short story of clouds and storks. Pixa may be one of the best which know about human emotion and feeling for priceless things. For me, the most amazing moment of Up is in the first 15 minutes. With the old album showing Carl and Ellie's photos, I could see how much they have cared for each other, and how much they have dreamed. This scene is very well created. The colorful and beautiful balloons from Up will not be forgotten for a long time. Up realizes the dream, which anyone probably have had in his or her life, for the person. After watching it, I felt like I traveled somewhere very exotic and fantastic.",9,0,0,22 March 2012
The Lion King," to be, or not to be, that is the question?
","When i watched The Lion King for the first time, it was about 15 years ago. I was very young, and the death of Mufasa made me cry. And this year, I went to the cinema to watch The Lion King 3D. I had thought I would not cry this time, but i was wrong. I cried again in the same scene. It is still an awesome animation. through watching it, i felt this movie is actually based on Hamlet, which is kind of orthodox now. The basic story lines of the two are pretty much similar. Simba and Hamlet went through their fathers' death whose responsibility is on their uncles, and they try to fight against the evil uncles. Dead fathers' shapes make them feel guilty by keeping saying 'remember.' Still, the two works are different at the same time. Simba overcame all the problems and revenged his father. The Lion King ended happily ever after, unlike Hamlet. The differences are from the existence of Timon and Pumbaa, no doubt. The tragic question 'To be, or not to be' gets replaced with 'Hakuna Matata,' and the fact makes the wholly different endings. The two amazing and priceless friends are truly huge parts of the movie.This time when i watched it, I felt sorry for Scar a little bit. When i was young, Scar was an absolute villain to me, but i think Scar could be a pathetic thing which desperately desired to be a king. (anyway he definitely did wrong things) maybe I grew too much. Just as Spring comes after Winter, as Simba has his son, i hope the pure days come to me again.",7,0,1,29 February 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," good suspense
","It has been a quite long time to watch a surprisingly nice and scary thriller film like this. There is no ghost, no ear-splitting sound, but horror comes calmly. Power of story and characters. The Silence of the Lambs numbed me with its notorious(?) thrilling characters and scenes. Now I understand why this movie is so much famous and loved. It deserves to be called a masterpiece of thriller. I guess it will be fun to catch some homage for The Silence of the Lambs in later films. Anthony Hopkins was just Dr. Lecter himself. His existence was very irresistible. Buffalo Bill was also great, but it is well described in the film that he is just a cocoon compared to the moth, Dr. Lecter. The actors play their characters wonderfully. The most shocking thing about the film is that Anthony Hopkins was in the film only for 15 minutes, in total. He is brilliant. I hope I would have a chance to watch more films like this in 2012.",8,0,0,12 March 2012
X-Men: First Class," coolest x-men ever
","I am a huge fan of X-Men series, and I must say that X-Men: The First Class is my favorite of the all. At first, I didn't expect that much, but I absolutely enjoyed the movie and loved it after all! New more kinds of X-men and mutants are awesome, and the past of Professor X and Magnito is so interesting. Especially about Magnito, I think this movie is successful to make the character more lovable and attractive. Watching the time Charles and Eric were close friends was very nice. It is described with delicacy and care, so that the movie is somewhat heart warming, and somewhat thrilling. The tragic past of Eric makes me understand why he so hates normal humans and how the figure Magnito was created. He is not an evil nor villain at all, but he should keep fighting. And i think the fact makes X-Men series more profound and cooler.This movie clears everything up of the previous ones and contains a story about all of them, so it's meaningful for people who love X-Men. Now I am waiting for the next one. X-Men always feels good. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were great actors to play Charles and Eric respectively. Kevin Bacon was the best. he was a real villain in the movie.",8,1,1,14 March 2012
Toy Story 3," reminds me of my childhood
","Toy story 3 is definitely one of my favorite films ever. I watched toy story 1 and 2 when young, and i didn't have any practical concept about favorites at the time. Hence I would say that Toy story becomes my favorite quite recently. (but i am sure i enjoyed 1&2 a lot) Around the time when I am getting old and getting to forget about first and second series of toy story, i rushed into the theater right after hearing that toy story 3 is released. And some hours later, i found myself crying and this movie became actually one of my best. i must mention about the short but great story called 'day and night' shown before the movie. This brilliant idea and humanism Pixa makes always leads people to their childhood and purity even before the movie really starts. Such a great opening. While toy story 3 went, I could take lost parts of my childhood out to the real. It describes so well all the toys' feelings toward the process that one child who used to be the closest friend of them is actually moving on to a grown up who would not play with them anymore. And the fact that the process is a kind of destiny of human beings make it sadder. However, the film is not filled only with sadness. Of course on the one hand, it is quite tragic that toys got nothing but their human friends, and humans are destined not to take all of their toys to the society. On the other hand, however, it would suggest some ideas that we can possibly see the world in a different way. Toy Story 3 seems to change the trend and stereotype that toys only belong to children. As a genre, animation itself is usually considered as a child's one. but Toy Story 3 shows that grown ups actually can get impressed and enjoyed with all their hearts through animations. Toy Story 3 made me realize there were some moments I fell asleep hugging my toys and dolls. it was so nice and amazing to watch toy story again as an adult with the childhood memories. Another amazing fact! Toy story series itself has passed time and got old with us together. The producers, voice actors, and even the graphics. That might be a reason that people are moved more.",10,2,3,27 February 2012
