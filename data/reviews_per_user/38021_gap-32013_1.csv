Hereditary," Please read if you've lost someone close to you
","I've never written a review before. This movie had some good things in it but the over all, this crack pot story just wasn't good. The reason I wrote this is to warn people who have lost a loved one too young. Without getting into spoilers just don't watch this. I lost a brother about two years ago and I wish I wouldn't have watched this movie. It honestly made me feel sick. The movie to me goes like this. It starts slow as dirt. Then it shocks you and if you're like me makes you feel sick. Then it becomes just weird and demented. Saying all of this, it does have good moments and the acting is great; that is why I gave it a three, but over all I will not be recommending anyone to go and see hereditary in theatres or at home. This is a movie that I hope slides on through without anyone else being caught in the web of the 'this generations exorcists' reviews.",3,5,11,13 June 2018
