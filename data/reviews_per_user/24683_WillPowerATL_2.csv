The Blair Witch Project," An Interesting experiment, but failed in some aspects...
","Perhaps it was the buildup that killed this movie for me. Since I work in the entertainment industry, I have many friends who have already been to see screenings of this film in various cities, and although reviews were mixed, there were actually several who defined it as 'the scariest movie I have ever seen.'  When I went, I tried to keep my expectations low, so I wouldn't be disappointed, but it didn't work.This film just didn't scare me. I was impressed with the concept, and the improvisation of the three young actors was, at times, more original and heart-felt than most of the acting I have seen lately in big-budget films. But despite this supernova of creativity, BWP never became more than an interesting experiment for me.  The gaping holes and inconsistencies in the story made me think about things too much, and some of the improvisation and events were obviously 'goal-oriented,' and were too contrived to effectively mesh with the rest of the film's naturalistic methods.  In all, there were many times where I had to say, 'No way, someone in this situation wouldn't do that!' or even 'What is that supposed to be? I don't get it.'Although I am glad I saw the movie, apparently I didn't share the same experience most of my fellow moviegoers did. It seemed to me like I had just sat through a two-hour campfire story, but one told by a novice storyteller. I found myself picking at the inconsistencies, and feeling let down.  After several hours of buildup, I left the theater unfulfilled.Again, I seem to be the only one that thought this.  Most of my friends LOVED the film.  Of course, most of them are idiots, so don't take their advice.  See it on the matinee to really get your money's worth.",3,1,4,18 July 1999
The Legend of Bagger Vance," A Supermodel film: Beautiful but without substance
","This film definitely has a 'Robert Redford' feel to it.  It has some beautiful cinematography and a wonderful style to it.  Beyond that, however, it falls short of being a good film.  To begin with, the film is full of unbelievable moments.  Although suspension of disbelief is an important part of watching any film, this one pushes the limits.  Not only are the golf scenes a bit impossible, but such scenes as the one where the black caddie lounges in the white locker room are not easy to swallow.Also detracting from the film is the lack of closure or depth to any of the storylines.  We have a character scarred by war who neither explains his story nor comes to terms with it.  We have a boy at odds with his father, and the two never have a meaningful conversation but just miraculously appear to be reunited.  We have a girl left to wait ten years for her man, who simply welcomes him back without ever speaking her mind or seeking retribution.  Even the framing sequence is without substance.  None of the stories are resolved with any satisfaction, although all are glossed over to make for a happy ending.Finally, the actors are strong, but don't seem to fit their roles. Charlize Theron's accent is awkward, Matt Damon has trouble pulling off drunk and jaded, and the jovial Will Smith is implausible as the sage mentor.  The best roles are filled by the young boy and the two competing golfers, but none of them are written with any great depth.In the end, there are no lessons learned, no big point to be driven home, no gripping emotional realizations.  It is a beautifully shot film...about golf.  If you get anything out of it except for 'golf is good,' then let me know.  Believe it or not, I enjoyed the film a bit, but I was disappointed in the fact that it could have been so much more.  If I had paid to see it, I would have probably been more than disappointed--I may have been angry. Do yourself a favor and wait for the video version.",5,0,1,21 October 2000
