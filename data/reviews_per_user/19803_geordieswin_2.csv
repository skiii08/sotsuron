It," What a let down
","Massively disappointing, pennywise sounds like scooby doo,not a patch on the original. Be warned.... chapter 2 is even worse.",5,1,1,27 November 2019
It Chapter Two," To much change and to much cgi
","Well without being biased this was never going to be better than the original as its a classic and one of my favourite movies ever made. However this 'remake' didn't even come close. There was to many changes to the original and the CGI animations were unbearable at times,its also very long and dragged out. 5/10",5,0,0,27 November 2019
