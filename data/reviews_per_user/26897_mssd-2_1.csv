Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Gay? Like Fat Nude Guys?
","There really are some funny scenes But those are tempered by some really disturbing scenes... However, if your gay you may really enjoy this film.. Gays are well represented. As are Jews and a certain wild animal. I'd wait to rent it on DVD unless of course your under 30.. Then the movie will make you wonder what other visuals life might present.. I went to see this with an open mind and dragged my two sons along. Age 16 and 18 and they were totally 'scarred for life' by some of the Borat and crew nude fight scenes. I was really hoping for a better Pamala encounter but shouldn't have been surprised by the lack of imagination on the part of the writer. I can only guess he wanted to stay true to the Russian back woods theme. Overall this moview works. Not sure why, it breaks a mold I was not ready to see broken.",5,2,5,12 December 2006
