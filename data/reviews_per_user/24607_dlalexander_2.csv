The Incredible Hulk," Reliving the MCU... The Incredible Hulk!
","The forgotten movie of the MCU!Either through the replacement of Edward Norton with Mark Ruffalo or the darker tone/setting this film seems to be the one people ignore in their trip through the Marvel universe.I saw this in 2008 hot off the heels of Iron Man, and I was not disappointed! What a summer blockbuster! At the time it fit well into expanding the MCU, having a tonal shift from Iron Man made perfect sense fitting the character of The Hulk.With 2020 vision; the CGI isnt quite what I rembered it being (I was in awe in 2008 of the Hulk after previously only seeing Ang Lee's Abomination). But irrespective, it does not hurt the films action sequences.Speaking of action! The college campus scene is the standout, followed by the slums in Brazil. Both great sequences!The last fight in Harlem is a CGI mash up, not bad, but not the most engaging sequence the film has. It has a predictable outcome, that set up the future of The Hulk that never happend!Let's look at casting;Roth as Blonksy is inspired. He comes across as a psychotic soldier, turned into an anti-hulk. It's a shame he hasn't been brought back into the fold. He was clearly set up for being in The Hulks future.Liv Tyler plays the love interest well. She adds a subtext that serves the Banner character well in motivation. Bruce is a tragic figure, having this matched the tone the film was looking for. Again a shame she hasn't played a part in the future of the MCU. No Norton = no Tyler.General Ross is perfectly cast and makes his return as the Thunderbolt later in the MCU and rightfully so! He is the antagonist of Banner, and plays the obsessive General brilliantly. Their relationship could have been better later on, but is ignored primarily because this film is!Edward Norton as Bruce Banner...
The controversy! I enjoyed Norton as Banner, he played the quiet introvert aspect better than Ruffalo does.
Ruffalo brings the tragedy of the character out through comedy in comparison to Norton being melancholic.
Now... I would have been happy with a continuation of Norton but at the same time am happy it ended up being Ruffalo, whom could have easily starred in this film. Overall the tonal shift of the MCU fits Ruffalo better.Do not miss this film. It sits in the MCU where it should and plays it's part! It introduces the super solider syrum, carrys on The Avengers tease, expands the universe and has some nice Stark Enterprises easter eggs! It is there to be enjoyed and too its credit, is entertaining in its execution.",7,0,0,25 February 2020
Iron Man," Reliving the MCU
","On my nostalgia trip through the MCU, I have gone back to where it all began!Iron Man is one of those films that can be watched again and again without losing its charm or originality, even in 2020!The first time Tony 'suits up' is just as awesome today as it was in 2008, it was the moment I was hooked on marvel and hooked on the MCU.Paltrow brings a charm to the film that expands the character of Tony and makes him more relatable than the character we meet at the start. The beginnings of this relationship far reaching through the MCU.RDJ is perfect as Stark, exceptional casting for the character that shoulders Marvel for the next 10 years plus!The story of the film is pretty simple and follows true to the comics (adding it's own MCU twists and nuances) and quickly sets up the goodies and baddies needed for a superhero flick! Bridges is the sinister businessman that is easy to hate from the get go and establishes himself as the main antagonist by turning his back on Tony.The end fight is standard fair when viewing it with 2020 vision, but in 2008 had me jumping from the seat having never seen anything quite so much fun before. Mechanical suits, explosions, witty quips... excellent stuff.
When watching it now, I was taken back to the days when one superhero on screen made me gawk!I will watch and re-watch this throughout my life. A reminder of the simpler times of the superhero, but also a beginning to the best movie franchise ever made!Dont forget to watch the cameo at the end of Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. Blew my mind in 2008, now is a reminder of where the 'Avengers' first get mentioned in mainstream films!",8,0,0,24 February 2020
