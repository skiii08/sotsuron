Kill Bill: Vol. 2," This movie IS for everybody!!!!
",I saw this movie last night with my brother and we were stunned at all the beautiful camera work. The direction of this movie is enough to see the movie alone. The comes the movie itself which is amazing. Its better than the first volume and keeps itself fresh the whole way through. Its got a very good story and they pull it off brilliantly. The score adds to the movie to you'll especially notice how good the soundtrack is when the bride fights Elle.Spoiler ALERT...My favorite scene is where she's buried alive it actually made you feel helpless and like you could barely move. The music when shes digging out is also some of the best off the soundtrack.My only complaint is that we didn't get to see Bill use his kung fu skills. The fight at the end should have well.. happened because there wasn't a fight really.The training scenes were unforgettable as is the whole movie. I recommend this movie even if you didn't like volume 1 because they are very different in so many ways. Go see this movie. 10/10,10,1,2,17 April 2004
