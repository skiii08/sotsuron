Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great effects, the best Star Wars so far
","Star Wars episode one should have been made after the return of the jedi years ago, it was fantastic! The music was really good. However, Harrison Ford was much better than Liam Neeson. The imagination from George Lucas really shone through here and although the fighting scenes looked like the ones from Mulan and Braveheart, they were still brilliant. You have to see this one at the cinemas.",9,0,0,20 June 1999
The Big Lebowski," Lame excuse for a movie
","The Coen brothers latest movie is really disappointing. I really liked Fargo and wanted to see the Big Lebowski because Fargo was so good. The film went nowhere. A useless plot and unlikeable characters made this film sink into the depths of disaster. Watch it if you're bored, and can I ask what Julianne Moore was on when she decided to be in this rubbish?",6,2,5,4 July 1999
As Good as It Gets," Nearly as good as it gets.
","Jack Nicholson deserved an Oscar in this film for his portrayal of a guy who doesn't have the easiest of lives to deal with. He played him excellently well and Helen Hunt was also quite good. The movie wasn't a masterpiece, but it had some good lines and a sharp script. Well worth watching.",8,0,0,3 July 1999
12 Monkeys," Pretty good
",Twelve Monkeys keeps you wondering throughout. Madeline Stowe and Bruce Willis are both good in this film and as a result we are left with a spectacle of emotions and a plot which unfolds consistently and very well. It's good to see an idea which has transformed well to film because sometimes a writer can think of a good idea and waste it.,7,1,2,3 July 1999
Happy Gilmore," Sandler's best so far
",This is such a good movie you can watch it over and over and not get tired of it. This movie made Adam Sandler become the ridiculously wealthy person he is today.  It's very funny and there are many stand-out scenes. I think it is so popular because it makes fun of one of the most boring sports ever to be played - golf.,10,1,1,17 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," See it at the cinemas
",This is an above average comedy but repeated viewings aren't really what its about. The first time you see it will be very good but the others you won't find so funny. The songs are annoying after a while but you should go see it just for the swearing at the start and the Kyles mom is a bitch song by Cartman which is excellent.,9,0,0,8 August 1999
Blade," Surprisingly good
","I didn't expect much at all from this vampire movie, but it was actually quite good.  It showed some good ideas and was east to watch.  I don't know why they're making a sequel to this but I guess if it makes money...!  There was good action and lots of blood to quench a vampires thirst, go and see it.",6,0,1,17 July 1999
The Mummy," Boring!!!
",The Mummy is just another Hollywood stuff up. It has the potential but it just never breaks any new ground and never interests the viewer. I don't know how it made so much money because there are films out there that are so much better than this quickly made mess.,5,0,0,4 September 1999
L.A. Confidential," Bearable
",This is a movie which has received critical acclaim from critics. But why? It is interesting for a while but all in all it is pretty boring and to watch the whole movie would be an achievement. The acting is good from all the leads but the story is overlong and dragged out.,Null,1,3,11 July 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Above average comedy
","The first half hour of this movie is brilliant and the rest is also very good. Julia Stiles is awesome and very convincing playing the shrew who has a few layers of baggage from her past which has her running scared from a future. This is one of William Shakespeare's better story's. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",Null,0,0,11 July 1999
American Pie," WOAH Finally a brilliant teen movie!
","American Pie is the funniest, most interesting and surprisingly consistent movie I've seen in a long, long while. This is probably due to the fact that the script writers actually thought when they wrote the script! Unlike the writers of Runaway Bride and Carrie 2. When I saw this movie the whole cinema was full and it was such a great atmosphere because people were in constant hysterics from start to finish. Make sure you see American Pie, you'll only be disappointed if you decide to see Wild Wild West instead!",Null,0,0,3 September 1999
Face_Off," Cool Movie
","This is a film for everyone, it's fast paced although it is long, it's an action movie as well as a drama. This action movie is different from other action films because there is excellent acting and a good idea which has turned out well in a script over two hours. It could have been very easy for the director to make this a confusing story but he has made it a very straightforward one and a very interesting one. John Travolta is much better in this considering his other role in the horrible Mad City that same year, and Nicolas Cage is really good also. Both are very convincing. Joan Allen is also good as Travolta's wife. I highly recommend it.",Null,0,1,5 July 1999
Days of Thunder," Great action movie
","The writers of Days of Thunder brought a car racing film into life, gave it a great plot and put in some great actors like Robert Duvall, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. It really is a great movie and with its fast plot the action never slows down. If you've seen it, see it again.",Null,1,4,3 July 1999
Men in Black," Alien Movie...
","What else can you say about this, there isn't much of an idea here but it's still entertaining all the same. There isn't any Oscar winning acting or direction but it's still good to watch two guys blow up aliens and see them shoot people to make them lose their memory. I don't see any reason for a sequel but I'm sure they will make a lot of money none the less.",7,0,0,5 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," My Eyes were Wide Shut
","This is a promising movie for quite a while, until Tom Cruise's character goes into the orgy scene. From then on the whole movie falls apart, no longer are we intrigued about sexual desire, rather we are bored senseless by a bunch of people wearing masks and hoods. Nicole Kidman is the only good thing about this movie and really it would be nothing worth talking about without her. I've now seen two Stanley Kubrick films and I have to say that he is one sick man with no dream with his work, no vision and not a clue about writing either! Why does so much praise get given to him when his work is just long drawn out plotless crap?",Null,0,0,2 September 1999
The Waterboy," This is a comedy?
","The Waterboy is the most annoying, crap movie I have ever seen. I liked Happy Gilmore and the Wedding Singer but this was just too unfunny and did I mention boring! Most of the reviews for this movie tend to say what I thought after watching this movie...they say it's bad. I couldn't stand Adam Sandler's accent, it annoyed me so much I felt like screaming at him. Why did Kathy Bates have to lower herself and appear in this crap. She was so good in Misery, and to then go and do this to her credibility...now her credibility has lowered about 50%. This is a movie I advise you to avoid at all costs, renting it on video would be a waste of money, seriously.",4,2,3,11 July 1999
Scream," Brilliant horror movie
","Scream is another masterpiece from the director Wes Craven who brought us the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. With a terrific and truly magnificent script written by Dawson's Creek writer Kevin Williamson, Scream makes you wonder who the killer is for the whole duration of the movie. There are many twists and these twists make you question who the real killer is. An excellent cameo appearance from Drew Barrymore make Scream even better and great performances by Neve Campbell (Party of Five) and Courtney Cox (Friends), Scream will frighten you and make you SCREAM for more! Horrors haven't come better than this since Carrie and Halloween. I eagerly await Scream 3 with great anticipation.",10,0,0,12 June 1999
The Sixth Sense," Good
","This is a reasonably good drama (not thriller or horror!) with great acting from Willis, Collette and Osment. The two later should receive oscar nominations for their roles. Bruce played a character that wasn't to emotionally involving so it wasn't too much of a stretch for Willis. All in all an interesting plot with its share of moments of brilliance.",10,0,0,31 October 1999
Rear Window," A must see thriller
",Every thriller fan has to see this film. Its suspenseful throughout and never leaves you feeling bored. James Stewart is at his best here as a guy who watches some mysterious happenings through the lens of his binoculars. You have to see for yourself.,10,1,3,3 July 1999
The Truman Show," What's the fuss about?
","Jim Carrey's first attempt at drama has rewarded him with the Golden Globe and other awards but why is this? The film is boring and not really that interesting at all. I gave it a real chance though and tried not to be judgemental because I wanted to like it. But it did fall short of being a good, inventive movie. I thought Jim Carrey was good and so was Ed Harris and Laura Linney who was really good in her role. Despite the good acting, however, the film didn't quite reach my expectations and considerably fell short of being as excellent as everyone has been saying.",6,0,2,20 June 1999
The Matrix," Keeps you entertained
","The Matrix displayed a lot of depth script wise and acting wise. I enjoyed it immensely and found it to be very interesting which is something found rarely in this time of making movies in a month without caring if the audience will actually like the movie. The Matrix also has a great last 45 minutes of action which is similar but better than hackers. the acting was great because each member of the cast really cared about this movie, you could tell. They cared so much that the movie took almost a year to make. I recommend this film to everyone and if you can see it in the cinema it will be worthwhile.",9,0,0,20 June 1999
The Wedding Singer," Good comedy
","This is not Adam Sandler's best film but it is certainly better than the Waterboy! Drew Barrymore is always good and was convincing in this movie also.  This film will remind you of the eighties - the clothes, music etc. Could have been better but it's still worth watching.",8,0,1,17 July 1999
