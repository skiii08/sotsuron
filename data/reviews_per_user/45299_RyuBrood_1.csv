E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," EXCELLENT MOVIE
","Today I was having an argument with one of my friends regarding The Matrix being much more creative than E.T. Which I believe to be false, if E.T was brilliantly creative for it's time. If it was made today Spielberg, being the intelligent director that he is would have made this movie 10 times better than it was in 1982.Does anybody agree?",10,1,2,12 August 2003
