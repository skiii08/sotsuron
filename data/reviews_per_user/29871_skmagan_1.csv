E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 20th Anniversary Edition is no biggy
","With all the hoopla & rumours about this edition, my wife & Idecided to see it the first day it came out, in Rockland County, NY,at the 5 p.m. showing.   I've seen this movie everytime it came outin the theater, and maybe 6 times when it came out on videoawhile ago and besides E.T. and a bathtub scene, I don't see whatall the hype is about.  The sound stunk, which is due to a lousy jobby the theater crew at Loew's Cinemas and it stunk because afather kept talking to his kids, other than that, the sound was o.k. The 'bad' 'evil' words that were in E.T. are still in E.T., like 'PenisBreath', and 'Douche Bag' are still in the movie.   In the originaledition, I didn't notice the guns too much, so the walkie talkiesweren't too much of a change for me.    Other than poor sound bythe theater crew, and a father & a kid on his lap kept on flappingtheir jaws, the movie was still the same, a GREAT movie. :)",Null,0,1,23 March 2002
