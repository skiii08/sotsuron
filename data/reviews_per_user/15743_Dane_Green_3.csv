Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Spectacular... and it's only volume 1!
","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a story about revenge and vengeance. Uma Thurman plays *bleep* *bleep* AKA The Bride AKA Black Mamba, a female assassin. A member of the Deadly Viper Assasssination Squad AKA DiVAS. Bill is the leader of the DiVAS. When The Bride gets pregnant, she wants to get married and the leave the business. This cost her the lives of nine people, including her unborn child. After the DiVAS beat the hell out of her, Bill puts a bullet in her head. But, she's still alive. Just in a four year coma. But, when she wakes up... she has some unfinished business with five people!1. O-REN ISHII 2. VERNITA GREEN 3. BUDD 4. ELLE DRIVER 5. BILLThis film, in my point of view, is probably the most violent movie ever. It nearly was rated  NC-17 , do to the violence. But, Quentin put a part of the film in Black and White so it didn't look as violent. Used 450 gallons of fake blood. It features some of the best sword fights in cinema history. Along with one of the best performances in cinema history by Uma Thurman. Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece is perfect from beginning to end. At the end of the film, it includes the best cliffhanger in any movie I've ever seen.All together this film is spectacular... and it's only volume 1!Rated R for strong bloody violence, language, and some sexual content.100/100 10/10 5/5 ****/**** A+++++",10,1,2,4 August 2004
