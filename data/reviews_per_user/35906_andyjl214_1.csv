The Ring," very good movie
",i thought that this movie was very good movie because it wasnt like the typical horror movie which includes the same individual going around killing people. this movie has a virtually an annonymus killer and that i think adds suspense. another thing thats makes the movie good is the fact thats it also as mystery in it when the main characters try to figure out to destroy the tape.,10,0,0,12 December 2002
