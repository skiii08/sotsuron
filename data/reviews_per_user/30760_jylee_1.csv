Casablanca," what a movie!
","I know that I won't be saying anything original here, but I have just watched Casablanca for the first time in a few years and I continue to be impressed by it.  Not only is it not an exaggeration to call it the greatest movie in Hollywood history, it deserves revisiting--if for no other reason than to inventory the number of times dialogue, sets, plot, and characters have been 'borrowed' in other movies over the last fifty years or so. Definitely deserves all the praise.",10,1,1,24 April 2000
