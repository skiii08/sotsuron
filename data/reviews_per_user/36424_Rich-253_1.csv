Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A big disappointment. Weak story and dull characters.
","The movie definitely did not live up to its hype.  But even more it did not have the same feeling, the same emotion as the three movies that preceded it.  I wanted a good story and good characters that I could feel something for, and got little or none of that.  The entire film seemed aimed directly at kids under twelve, and was designed to dazzle them with as many special effects as could be crammed into 130-some odd minutes.  I found the overabundance of computer generated graphics and characters to be, in the end, distracting and a bit annoying.",6,0,1,27 May 1999
