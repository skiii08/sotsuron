50 First Dates," Interesting premise, but completely Sandler-ized
","OK, let's get the obvious comments out of the way: 'Groundhog Day' bladibladi 'Memento' blablabla 'The Misadventures of Death And Phug' blabla. Yes, this movie is about a person with no memory, repeating the same day over and over again. This has been done before, but it's not a clichÃ© - and anyway, the angle of this movie is a lot different than those three, so let's just give all that a rest.In actual fact, I found the concept of this movie interesting - a real twist on the old love story fare. Man With Fear Of Commitment Finds Woman With No Memory - it's a fun little jigsaw. And, for all intents and purposes, the skeleton of this movie works fine. But. BUT! This is where I get annoyed. This movie is crammed full of pointless and annoying cheap gags. I don't know if it's just me, but I am not particularly appreciative of super-intelligent cutesy animals who understand everything said to them in plain English and respond with a suitable adorable sound/flipper gesture. Animals don't act like this. They never have, they never will. It p***es me off. Also, the movie just HAD to tack on some meaningless gross-out moments via the horny and androgynous Slavic assistant and (hold on to your hats and glasses) somebody getting showered from head to foot in walrus puke. Ah, the subtlety. And will somebody shut the old Hawaiian guy up, who has no function in the movie other than saying 'hilarious' cuss words? I think the writer of the original screenplay is pretty horrified at how his movie was represented. I would have been.",5,6,11,1 August 2005
Fight Club," I am Dave's impressive, black film
","I can not say much about this film. I have just finished watching it this instant, and it's taking its sweet time to sink in.I can talk about the shallow stuff. The direction, as always with David Fincher, is impressive, innovative and flawless. He seems to be able to bring out hidden levels of talent in his actors. Even the usually good Brad Pitt moves up a notch when taking directions from Mr. Fincher. The camera, quickly and smoothly moves around places in some sequences that are, well, impossible to film. Everything about this film's feel relates to Edward Norton's inner character. It's just excellently well done.I can talk about the role of Brad Pitt as the Jesus-like rebel with the anti-establishment ideas and his rounding up of brainwashed disciples. A little controversial parallel, but in the bigger scope of things I think it's suitable.The resolution of this film is unexpected and excellent. Do all you can not to know anything about this film before you see it. The surprises should be surprising (and they are).I gave this film a 9. The only thing that held me back from giving it a 10 was the 'I am Jack's over-used joke line' (although it does, come to think of it, make sense in light of the ending). It it still an absolute must-see film.",6,0,2,21 May 2000
Sleepy Hollow," The True Story Of The Conception Of Sleepy Hollow
","One day, a board of movie studio executives were gathered around a big, big table. One of them burst out: 'Guess what! I just signed a deal to make the Sleepy Hollow story into a movie!'<ul><li>'Get out!', said the others, 'that cool story with the headless knight?'</li></ul><ul><li>'The very same', the first one said, 'and guess who will be writing the screenplay? Andrew Kevin Walker!'</li></ul><ul><li>'No way!', the others shouted, 'the guy who wrote Se7en and 8MM? That guy is a true master of the dark and the suspenseful! He'll make that story into the true underbelly of sleaze and grit it deserves! WOW!'</li></ul><ul><li>'Wait a second', said one of the others, even though he was as excited as the rest, 'won't the story lose the essential storybook feel if a realist like Walker is writing the screenplay?'</li></ul><ul><li>'Never fear!', proclaimed the first, 'because to direct this movie, I have none other than... Tim Burton! Complete with Johnny Depp and Danny Elfman, as always!'</li></ul><ul><li>'Fantastic!', screamed one of the others, knocking his chair over backwards in excitement, 'That's simply perfect! Burton's off-beat style will complement the story and Walker's gritty take on the story and make this the movie of the year!'</li></ul><ul><li>'The decade!', screamed another.</li></ul><ul><li>'The century!', shrieked a third.</li></ul><ul><li>'Marvellous!', they cried. 'Splendid! Wonderful! How did you do it?'</li></ul>But one of the others, a reedy little man with spectacles, said: 'I don't think it will be that good after all.'<ul><li>'Not that good?', exclaimed the others, furiously, 'weren't you listening? Burton! Walker! Depp!'</li></ul><ul><li>'Furthermore', the reedy man carried on, 'I think the end result will be disappointingly tame. There will be no sparkle, the actors will look like they don't really care about anything, and the whole thing will feel like a made-for-TV movie with a special effects budget.'</li></ul><ul><li>'Ridiculous!', hissed one.</li></ul><ul><li>'Preposterous!!', seethed another.</li></ul>But the reedy man was absolutely right.",6,11,18,22 October 2006
Taxi Driver," A powerhouse of a film
","I didn't know much about this film. I knew Jodie Foster was in it, and Robert De Niro. I knew about the 'you looking at me?'-part. But apart from that, I sat down with this film, knowing nothing about it.I have only seen it once, but I can't wait to see it again. It's one of those films that seem to unfold and develop, but once you've finished watching it, you see that it was like that all along. You want to see it again, armed with hindsight. A few words about the supporting cast. Jodie Foster is impressive, even though she is only on screen for about 10 minutes altogether. Harvey Keitel is wonderful and the sleazy, manipulative pimp Matthew 'Sport'.But Robert De Niro is, of course, the dominant role in this film. His unstable psyche is slowly revealed, but his near-total lack of social skills and weird behaviour is seen early on. But we don't see the extent of them until circumstances (Cybill Shepherd's Betsy and a character played by Scorsese himself) and his decisions drive him right down to the bottom. And I mean *right* down. And at the bottom, what do we find? Nobility. The last thing you'd expect to find there. But there it is, in a warped yet instantly recognizable form. Excellence on film.",10,0,0,28 May 2000
Full Metal Jacket," Like fine wine, it has aged so well
","pages of pages of user comments here have already'sung this fantastic film's praises. The ultra-memorable Parris Island sequence featuring Gunnery Sgt. Hartman (whom, I would wager, no-one -- at least no adult male - can ever forget seeing. That's how memorably mean he really is) - Pvt. Pyle's descent, the final scenes with the sniper, etc.etc. It's simply a sublime movie, and no-one questions it.No, what I'd like to add is that this movie looks and feels simply spectacular. Stanley Kubrick's patented long takes, slow zooms and steadicam work, which permeate such wonders as 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'The Shining', are in full effect here, as well. The outdoor Vietnam sets are huge, foreboding and 100% real (they were sites in England set for demolition, but put to astoundingly good use as burned-out Vietnamese cities). This really shows how visceral a movie can be - and with not a single CGI shot in the entire movie! That's the coup de grace of this film, which will keep it looking more and more impressive for every passing year. A remake of 'Full Metal Jacket' would feature copious computer graphics, and it would look a lot worse. The genius of this film is that it feels so real because it is.This is a must-see film. So see it. At least three times over the course of your life.",10,1,2,20 October 2006
Being John Malkovich," So twisted, yet so straight, yet so queer, so odd yet so even.
","(Warning: There are possible spoilers in this comment. For the best viewing experience, it is best to know NOTHING about the movie at all.)This movie, along with having maybe THE best and most daring and original plot in the history of Hollywood movies, also has wonderful, colourful human interaction. All the characters - and I mean ALL - are glaringly dysfunctional, but they are this in such a way that their defects 'click' together to produce some of the great dialogues in cinema. The point where Craig tries to explain Maxine about just having been inside John Malkovich's head is just incredible in its simplicity and effectiveness. The interplay between Craig and Lotte is also crackling. This movie also contains one of the weirdest love interests ever - between a quasi-lesbian, domineering woman who is turned on by a woman inside a man's body, and a bored housewife who experiences the thrill of being inside John Malkovich and decides she's a transsexual. Thus, lines like 'I have to see you, Maxine.' - 'Ok, Lotte, I'll see you in Malkovich in an hour' are born. Wonderful, wonderful movie. See it with an open mind (but not so open as to let John Cusack get in through a muddy tunnel).",10,0,1,18 May 2000
The Fast and the Furious," Who exactly is furious in this flick?
","Oh, please make the boredom go away! Yes, there are men with big muscles and/or nice hairstyles. Yes, they have cars that can go really really fast, and - hey, wow! - they have these red buttons on their steering wheel that makes their cars go even faster. Vrooom! Ok, so what's the plot of the movie? Well, there's a cop (with good hair)(and a fast car) who is supposed to infiltrate a gang of people (with big muscles) (and fast cars). And they drive around real fast and press their buttons. And in the end, the cop seems to forget what his job is and just drives his car fast.Yeah, that's about it.",Null,0,1,1 August 2003
Batman Begins," Daringly different and a heckuva lot better.
","Alright, so first things first: the 'Batman' movie franchise only had one way to go, and that was up. After the painfully dreadful last one with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze, even filming a post-it note reading 'Batman Rocks!!!' for two hours and sending the videotape into national theater release would have been seen as an improvement.But this really IS a good Batman movie. This time, we're not seeing a comic book superhero movie. We're gently guided through a solid plot that culminates in the birth of Batman, at which point we're prepared to suspend our disbelief and say 'alright, so I guess Batman could really exist after all'. Even the bad guy is semi-plausible (even though he, obviously, plans a wacky batman-style supervillainy stunt which would be far-fetched in any other movie).Another thing is that the movie feels very much like an action-adventure from the mid-80's. Nolan's decision to use as little CGI as possible really shines through and melds with his relatively old-school camera style nicely to create a film which at most times feels like a forgotten classic from the days of the 'indiana jones' movies.Definitely worth a viewing!",8,1,1,20 October 2006
Amadeus," F. Murray Abraham is excellent
","Amadeus is in no way the perfect Mozart/Salieri biopic. It takes tremendous liberties with the truth, but that's no matter: it's entertaining and inspiring beyond belief. Mozart's natural musical acumen which Salieri envies so much is portrayed beautifully, and I almost felt myself becoming better at appreciating the highest ideals of music through his descriptions. The scene in which Salieri and Mozart work on getting the Requiem down on paper is the highlight of this side of the film: hearing and understanding the separate layers before hearing them altogether is a goose-bumpingly great experience.And F. Murray Abraham is an astonishing presence in the film. At one point, a rather poor actor playing a doorman comes to the door as Salieri is giving a lesson. The doorman delivers his line flatly, but Abraham's acting, in comparison to that, is incredibly nuanced, natural-looking, well-performed and believable. That's when I discovered that he won that Best Actor Oscar for a very,very good reason indeed.",10,3,6,19 October 2006
Children of Men," Science fiction done WELL.
","Sometimes it only takes one film to move a director into my personal pantheon of great directors. It doesn't happen too often, but I can't think of a better way to hit the fast track than by presenting this film to me. Everything about this film is just astonishingly memorable. The world it portrays is not only original and chilling, but also utterly perfectly realized, with an incredible level of detail in the environment and camera-work which simply defies belief.The story is simple, yet monumental; tiny, yet enormous.This is a rare sort of movie. And a huge feather in the cap of Mr. Cuáron. I'll be keeping an eye out for you, mister...",10,2,6,17 April 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," I get it, but I just don't like the end.
","I get it, I get it. The first three parts of this essentially four-part film are varying degrees of great. The 'Dawn of Man' segment looks a little dated, but it's undeniably a classic segment of cinema. The 'Sentinel' segment on the moon sets up the tone, casualness and general laziness of the film (please don't read the word 'lazy' in any negative sense. The amount of attention to detail is staggering in this movie, but the feel is still best described as lazy - leisurely and for the most part banal. This is completely intentional on the part of Stanley Kubrick, of course.) The 'Hal' segment is without a doubt the greatest segment, with incredible use of silence and slowness as a suspense-building mechanism, the unforgettable 'daisy' scene, etc etc. This segment is what proves to me that this movie knows exactly what it's doing.Which can only lead me to conclude that it knows what it's doing in the trippy final 'beyond infinity' segment. Heck knows, no-one else knows, but people love it: they call it poetic, inspirational, mind-expanding and so forth. I won't deny that people can get very strong emotions from the ending.My problem is that this segment is undeniably super-pretentious. It would look weird in Bruñuel movie. French cinema don't even give us this sort of completely humorless symbolism, the kind where you can almost hear the director sitting behind the camera, thoughtfully scratching his beard under his french beret and pondering the bleakness of existence when he really needs to unbutton the top shirt button and chill the hell out.(I get it, by the way. The star-child is the next step of human evolution, guided by the monolith just like in the beginning, bla bla)I was disappointed that Kubrick chooses to end his epic film like this. It crosses the line from entertainment into 'if you don't get this it's because you're stupid' territory. And if, as has been stated many times, he can't be any less vague because no-one knows the answers to the questions he's posed, he has no business making this movie in the first place. Because it's a movie, not a documentary. You invented the monolith, so get off your hiney and tell us more about it, OK?",9,5,14,22 October 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Not as perfect as many people say, but darn good!
","Let me get this off my chest: this movie is NOT perfect. It starts off with a lot of stuff that seems more at home in a pretentious film school project than a Charlie Kaufman flick. I didn't know it was the great Kaufman who had written the script, and for the first 15 minutes or so, I sat there wondering if the writer and director were George Lucas' kids or something, given a bunch of money to make a big-name vanity movie, a la 'The Brown Bunny'.Well, if I were to watch the movie again now, I'd understand that vague beginning, because the film really IS beautifully crafted, heartwarming and true to the concepts of love. But it takes a while to get that. Compared to the other Kaufman flicks I've seen (Human Nature, Being John Malkovich) it fails in that respect: it doesn't convince me that the wackiness is worth it from the get-go. I could have turned this movie off in annoyance that the movie was trying to hide Elijah Wood from me so ineptly (when in fact, I DIDN'T know what the movie was trying to hide after all). I would have missed a good movie experience.",8,0,2,21 October 2006
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick has done it again - almost
","'Eyes Wide Shut' is a dense film. I'm not quite sure what means exactly. It's just the feeling you have after you've seen it. The atmosphere in this film is so thick, you could cut it with a knife. Even in the great halls of the ceremonial palaces, the thick atmosphere manages to fill every nook and cranny. It's incredibly engrossing.As an example, consider the scene, where Alice (Nicole Kidman) and William (Tom Cruise) are kissing in front of a mirror in the beginning of the film. Alice is looking at herself in a horny, bad girl way. The light is orange. 'Baby did a bad bad thing' is blaring in the background. It's incredible. If you've seen it, you know what I mean.Stanley Kubrick was one of the great directors. We all know this. His choice of musical score, lighting, camera angles were as effective as they were bold. Where this film fails to reach the heights of 'Dr. Strangelove','Full Metal Jacket','Clockwork Orange' and the other great Kubrick films, is in the plot. The direction is flawless. The acting, especially by Nicole Kidman, is astounding. Whenever she is in a scene, she lights up (or should I say darkens?) the film. The joint scene in particular - I never knew Kidman could actually act! (That said, Tom Cruise seems to be free-wheeling through this film).But the plot. It's mysterious and exciting, but in the end it's disappointing. Again, if you've seen the film you'll know what I'm talking about. It sort of falls flat. You're left with a feeling that nothing really happened, that no character really grew, and that the film was just a blip in the character's lives.Ironic, really. I think Tom Cruise got a bigger story to tell from working with Stanley Kubrick on his last film, than his character in the film would have to tell about his experiences.",7,0,0,20 May 2000
Carrie," Excellent Storytelling
","This is a classic film. So I had seen it before today. But I was a kid, and I seem to remember the shock-scary parts as the catalysts to my nightmares, and not much about the rest.Today, I saw it again, armed with a huge backlog of movies. I have seen enough to discriminate the bad from the good, the mediocre from the excellent. And Carrie is certainly excellent.OK, so the premise is at first glance a little weird and far-fetched, but hey, that's Stephen King. What Stephen King also does is to somehow get these far-fetched situations blended in with believable reality. He creates a sort of grey zone between horror and reality. I suppose that's what makes his books frightening enough to entertain millions.Anyway, this is not a litterary review. Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a girl in her senior year of high school, raised by a fanatically christian woman (excellently played by a psycotically frizzy-haired Piper Laurie). She is teased and made fun of because of her naivety and oddness.So, a stereotypical bitch girl in Carrie's class, looking hideously 70s right down to the 'who wears' short shorts, plots a nasty, nasty surprise for Carrie. Without giving too much away, this surprise comes right at a time when Carrie is truly happy, for the first time in her life.It is in this classic scene, before and after the prank, that you see that Sissy Spacek is perfect as Carrie. She is introduced in the film as a shy, odd-looking, bland girl. Before the prank, she beams and smiles and she is beautiful. The change is truly remarkable. After the prank, well, she is pretty scary. All these attributes are contained perfectly within Spaceks appearance and acting. It's a shame we don't see her in more movies.The storytelling, as I have said in my one-line summary, is excellent. The foreshadowing of the prank is subtely and deftly introduced, so that the viewer knows in advance what's going to happen. Everyone, it seems, knows. Everyone but Carrie. We feel sorry for her and are on her side afterwards as well. This is something of a feat to pull off in Hollywood's 'white-teeth-big-jaw-squeaky-clean-super-hero' ideal.Carrie's internal development (excuse the pun) is paced just as well. Her growing rebellions against her mother, her realization that there is more to life than bible bashing...all the way through she blooms. The symbolism is perhaps a bit overstated in places (Who ever saw a Jesus figure that looked quite like that?) but is none the less quite effective, and drenches through the film appropriately.Brian DePalma is excellent at making movies that appeal on many levels. As a kid, I liked the scary parts. My mother, whom I watched it with, enjoyed it for the human interaction and the bitchiness of the girls and their 'reward'. I, as I have pointed out, enjoyed the pacing and the whole imagery of the film. Something for everyone.Oh, wait. There is one thing. The sight of Tommy Ross (William Katt) in his tuxedo is just awful. He is supposed to look sexy - the big catch at the prom - but his huge curly hair and the large lapels on his turqouise suit under his enourmous bow tie serve as a hideous reminder that the seventies were The Decade That Taste Forgot.",10,45,68,29 May 2000
Bruce Almighty," A notch in Carrey's bedpost
","It's nice to see that Jim Carrey is managing to grow somewhat as an actor. He's still got a long way to go to match, say, a Robin Williams, on the ol' 'stand-up comedian to serious actor'-ladder. But at least he's moving upwards. (I'm looking at you, Chris Rock.)In this film, Jim Carrey is almost the straight man; the farcical elements happen AROUND him, not BECAUSE of him. Intriguingly, there IS a very Carrey-esquire moment, but it's not Jim Carrey acting - it's his arch-rival Evan Baxter, who gets to act like Jim Carrey (and, may I say, that was a very nice performance by Steve Carell, the Daily Show alumnus).I like this movie because it's gutsy. It ventures into a controversial, spiky arena. I'm sure a lot of people are offended by the very thought that God is played by a black man, and that's just the beginning. It's an OK movie, but probably ultimately forgettable. A rung in the aforementioned ladder for Carrey and probably not much more.",Null,0,1,2 August 2003
