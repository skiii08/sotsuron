Black Swan," The Bottom Line
","Not to detract from any of the excellent reviews already posted, but some media personalities went for the lowest common denominator with their 'reviews'. Many of them were positive; advocating for the film and recommending to the audience to view the film. However, the 'it' factor for the majority of them was the relationship between the lead roles. In the process, they twisted the truth to the casual observer, and as such, I would like to give everyone the bottom line:Yes, Natalie Portman plays a lead role in this film. Yes, Mila Kunis plays a lead role in this film. Yes, there is a lesbian scene this film. No, there is no nudity in this film.So please, if you are going to (emphasis) enjoy (/emphasis) this movie, please do so with the understanding that it is an artistic offering, and not the kind of tawdry smut the mass media would have you believe.",Null,0,2,12 January 2011
