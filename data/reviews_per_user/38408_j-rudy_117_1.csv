Iron Man 3," Made only in the hope of box office success
","1) You do not mislead the audience by teasing in the trailer and the hype that The Mandarin would be a force to be reckoned with, and then have the most ridiculous reveal! 2) Tony tells Rhodey that his suits are designed for him, but places them on Pepper and Aldrich, I'm not sure if its only the Mark 42 that can do that, if so, they should have mentioned it in the movie.3) No explanation as to why some people blow up when injected with the extremis virus4) As everyone is saying, his armor withstands the forces of Thor and Aliens but fails miserably against the extremis soldiers.5) This is supposed to be an epic conclusion, not a comedy romp. I felt like I was watching Lethal Weapon.6) If the Mandarin was just an actor why would he need body guards and an entourage? Very very poor script.7) Building gadgets with hardware equipment, HOME ALONE!?There were so many more gripes about it. Thats why Nolan and Zack Snyder are masters at making sure we connect with the characters and connect with the story, instead of having a fast paced movie where we wouldn't have time to relate to whats going on.The ending should have been in the Mojave desert, with an extremis base of maybe 10000 soldiers, the u.s. army fights against them with tanks and choppers, but they make rubble out of them, then Tony and Rhodey make their way to the base but the suits lose power and they face the soldiers ahead of them, as the soldiers walk towards them, the other suits emerge through the dust and the darkness behind tony and Rhody... And the war begins.",1,229,457,25 April 2013
