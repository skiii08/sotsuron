Skyfall," one of the few Bonds I liked for its story more than the action
","I only skimmed through some of the reviews for this films, but I was shocked to see so many bad reviews. This is probably one of the few Bonds films - since Goldfinger - where I was interested enough in the story that I didn't get impatient waiting for the actions scenes. Admittedly, I used to only like Bond films for the action, and if you compare this to some of the more recent ones, it's not that action-heavy. It does have good action, but it also has a great story - not an overly confusing one, like some Bonds do. Unlike with some Bonds, the formulaic elements (the action scenes, confronting-the-villain scene, etc.)flowed smoothly, without feeling tacked on. Skyfall is great in ways that a lot of Bond films aren't.",8,2,6,23 June 2013
