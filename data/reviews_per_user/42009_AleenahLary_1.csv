E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Childhood nostalgy
","I remember the old times when it was on TV every New Year's Eve. I used to wake up from all that mess and party and just share some moments with my family watching this touching film, leaving everything we should have done after it. This is my favorite movie ever since then... It always remembers me of those old and innocent times. I was really impressed by Eliott's skills, he acted so natural. I guess everyone that watched this film just melted. It is an emotional, sensitive and educative story. It always brings me (I'm sure I'm not the only one) tears in my eyes every time I watch it. It just never gets old... It's suitable for all ages - we all have a heart :)",10,0,1,29 September 2013
