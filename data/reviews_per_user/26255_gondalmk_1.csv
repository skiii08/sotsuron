Skyfall," the worst James Bond 007 movie ever
","I have to say this was one of the worst James Bond movie I have ever seen. This was such a waste of time, money and talent of all those good actors. The only thing kept from the James Bond character is his name. The man can not even order his favourite drink, he has to reach for Heineken. What would be next, are they going to make him wear a skirt just because someone will pay money to see him in skirt?! The only motive in the movie is to make money of it, there is nothing else in it. It's a disgrace and betrayal of the James Bond character. They are killing the character.",1,12,24,27 January 2013
