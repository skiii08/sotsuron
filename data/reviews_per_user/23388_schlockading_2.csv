Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Episode I: The CGI Menace
","(This is my review after watching the prequel trilogy in detail for the first time as an adult.)The original trilogy of Star Wars established an immediately recognizable style of visual storytelling that, while constantly being reworked and dumbed down by subsequent special editions, has remained largely intact for the viewers of today. The stories were epic in scope, deftly utilizing archetypal characters and plot arcs, all while wrapping it into a new and exciting 'space opera' package. This, I think, is how Episode I steps off on the wrong foot. I would argue that the story of Anakin is reasonably compelling in its overall execution; it's more the many less-than-ideal production decisions that detract from the timelessness that defined the originals.Perhaps the most glaring of these choices is the gratuitous overuse of CGI. Please, George Lucas, just stop. His zeal for adding in splashy computer graphics over old practical effects in the special editions has gone completely unchecked here, and since it is the earliest of the three prequel films, the level of advancement in CGI technology had not made it nearly far enough to be a reasonable alternative to practical effects. (The one exception is CGI Yoda, which replaced the original puppet Yoda in the theatrical release who looked even worse.) As a viewer in 2017, the vast majority of these are just inexcusably bad and unnecessary.I'm slightly less bothered by how the rest of the story unfolds. For the most part it holds up: the political maneuvering, the crisis on Naboo, the journey to Tatooine and Anakin's struggle to free himself and his mother from slavery, and of course, 'the phantom menace' of Darth Maul and Palpatine. Somehow the slightly lazier pace of this movie made it feel more realistic, like there wasn't *always* a dire, civilization-threatening crisis going on for these people. There's enough conflict among the characters in their own lives to keep it interesting.That being said, the character development is far below what I would expect from Star Wars. While all the Star Wars movies are very plot-driven, having relatable characters is incredibly important, and the combination of stiff acting and bad screen writing just doesn't cut it here with the likes of Qui-Gon, Anakin, Padme, or God forbid Jar-Jar. And Anakin *really* should have been more like 12 or 13. Having a seven-year-old spout the lines that he did, and with whatever attraction Padme had for him, would have been many times less cringey had he been about five years older.Episode I takes what could've been a successful formula and makes it much less so with poor casting, screen writing, and production. I think if George Lucas and his team had taken this in a more refined, more thoughtful direction, it could have been great. Sadly that wasn't the case.",6,0,1,17 May 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not the disaster everyone is making it out to be
","The Last Jedi is not The Force Awakens. Some words I would use to describe the latter are conservative, safe, familiar; the former by contrast is complex, surprising, unnerving, and at times just plain weird. It's not the Star Wars we're used to, but I would argue, unlike most of the reviews I've seen thus far, that in most cases - but not all - Rian Johnson's new take on the Skywalker saga is effective and compelling.The story picks up with the Resistance evacuating their base yet again - a callback to the abandonment of Hoth in Empire Strikes Back (the last scene on Crait is also very similar to Hoth in a lot of ways, with the giant door and the AT-AT walkers and what not). The ensuing space battle with Poe Dameron at the helm is exciting and checks all the boxes for Star Wars space tech nerds - the Resistance throws just about every piece of hardware they have at the First Order, who are also sporting an incredible new B2-bomber-esque star destroyer. From there we get some weird power struggles between Poe, whose verve and determination in the face of authority border on caricature, and Leia along with new addition Vice Admiral Holdo, played by a badass, purple-haired Laura Dern in one of the most enjoyable performances of the film.Meanwhile, Rey is met by a reluctant and reclusive Luke Skywalker, who immediately ruins the dramatic tension of the final scene of The Force Awakens by tossing his lightsaber over a cliff as soon as Rey hands it to him. Mark Hamill's performance is brilliant, no doubt, and I was completely enthralled by this much older, wiser, and 'you can tell I've lived by myself for thirty years' version of Luke. But the exposition of Rey's desire to be trained in the Force and Luke's behavior towards her were confusing, muddy, and inconsistent. Is Rey really being beckoned by the dark side? What is Luke's real reason for not wanting to train her? What really happened with Ben Solo and the Knights of Ren? None of these questions are answered in a good hour's worth of screen time for the two of them. Rey and Kylo's Force 'conversations' were also a little weird, but I think in the end they made sense. Their dynamic in this installment is believable and much more nuanced - both are being called by the light and dark sides of the Force, and in the end we still don't know where either of them are headed going into Episode IX.A third subplot revolves around Finn and his newfound Resistance friend Rose, played by Kelly Marie Tran in another strong performance (I was shocked by how low she was in the billing order during the end credits). This was where things got really off track. They make a random galactic Skype call to Maz Kanata - completely unneccesary - who tells them to seek out a 'codebreaker' at a casino. Weird? Very. The ensuing sequence at said alien casino is almost as cringey as the diner scene with Obi Wan in Attack of the Clones - painfully derivative of something you might find on Earth, and not very timeless at all. They also weave in a weird anti-capitalist undertone as they tear up the place with alien versions of race horses. Benicio del Toro's character is honestly a waste, as he later betrays Finn and Rose to Captain Phasma and leaves without a hint of where his very gray morality actually lies. Phasma, for her own part, once again has a pitiable throwaway role, but instead of getting thrown into a trash compactor, Finn whacks her across the face and then she falls into a fiery chasm. Nice knowing you, Chrome Dome.So yes, I do have my gripes about some parts of the story and characters. But beyond this, I'd say a good 80% of the film is downright awesome (thus my rating of 8/10). The dynamic range of emotion and action is far greater than in The Force Awakens, and I loved it. It pushes the boundaries of what we're used to in Star Wars, usually to great effect. The entire scene with Kylo and Rey facing up against Snoke was a pure adrenaline rush. The set design here was incredible - the solid red backdrop and the masterful choreography made it almost feel like a scene out of Kill Bill. Was Snoke getting sliced in half Darth Maul-style slightly cheesy? Yes, but still awesome. The shot of Rey pulling Luke's lightsaber through Snoke's torso and into her hand across the room took my breath away.There were also so many more fun and touching scenes than in The Force Awakens. We get moments with Luke and Yoda (who was animatronic, I think? Or at least rendered in CGI to look animatronic. Kudos to ILM), Luke and Leia, hell, even Rey and Kylo - that plumbed an emotional depth unreached by Abrams, or arguably by any previous Star Wars film (maybe Rogue One but in a very different way). Rian Johnson isn't afraid to play with our expectations and oftentimes completely reverses them - whiplashing us between drama and comedy, seriousness and folly. Snoke the supreme leader? Nope, just some dude in a chair. Rey the daughter of Luke? Nice try. This is the majority of what the critics are upset about, and I think it's a nuance they'll come to appreciate with time.The film ends on a very strong note. Vice Admiral Holdo's heroic hyperspace sacrifice was shocking and touching. The battle on Crait is breathtaking to watch - I absolutely loved the idea of the salt flats with the red sand underneath, the trench-style warfare, and the old rust bucket fighters. Not only was it really cool visually, but it played a huge part in the overall symbolism between light and dark. The lightsaber battle between Kylo and 'Luke' was thrilling; the throwback to the binary sunset scene at the very end was heartwarming and very emotional. It was time for Luke to go - he knew that the Jedi texts (seen briefly nestled safely in a drawer onboard the Falcon in a later scene, which many people probably overlooked) were in Rey's possession, and in doing so he would not be 'the last Jedi,' as he himself reaffirmed. I think the end of this film sets up a perfect conclusion in Episode IX - we know Rey and Kylo will have to come to terms with their conflicted moral tendencies, the Resistance will either meet its demise or (more likely - come on, it's Star Wars) the allies in the outer rim will band together and come up with a way to defeat the First Order, and everybody will live happily ever after. Except Leia, I suppose. I really do hope they give Ms. Fisher a proper farewell.",8,0,0,15 December 2017
