Hereditary," Seriously!?
","I am a horror officianado and I can tell you this movie sucked! Long drawn out, no cohesiveness, plot was completely missing, not scary in the least....could not be more dissappointed! All that hype for what!? There is no more great horror movies! They have gone the way of the music industry...non-existent. Come on someone, somewhere scare me! Create something genuine that makes you cringe, hold your breath and scream with delight at a truly scary movie! Dumb....just plain dumb!",1,1,4,8 September 2018
