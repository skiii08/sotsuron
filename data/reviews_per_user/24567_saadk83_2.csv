The Blair Witch Project," Innovative, immersive, and polarizing
","TBWP is definitely one of those movies that really divides the audience. Some call it inventive or scary-as-hell while others think it was boring or nausea-inducingly-jerky.  I found the movie to be innovative and one that does not conform to pop-horror formula.  However, I too would hesitate to blindly recommend it to everyone.",7,0,1,18 June 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," CTHD is Flawless!
","Ang Lee is a true cinematic artist who happens to have wonderfully eclectic abilities.  He has shown that he can make light-hearted family films, classic costume dramas, dark and tense troubled family stories, and action/adventure epics.  And the best part is that they are all great.  I for one can't wait till Ang Lee shows us what he can do with the Hulk.",10,1,2,13 June 2003
