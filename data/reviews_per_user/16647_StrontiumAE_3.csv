Alien 3," Alien 3: Assembly Cut. Sci-fi for grownups.
","Before Se7en and Fight Club but after Alien and Aliens came visionary director David Fincher's Alien³. The third in the popular franchise, but easily one of the most hated, Alien³ is a grim allegorical tale about life, death, sin and redemption. And it is perhaps because of the weighty themes of this film that many fans of the franchise quickly turned their nose up at it.Directly following the events of Aliens, the film's surviving character's escape pod crash lands on a prison planet filled with Double Y Chromosome convicts who have now found religion. Unfortunately one surviving alien came with the pod and it is not long before it starts feeding off the prison population.A stark contrast to director James Cameron's flashy sci-fi action romp 'Aliens', Alien³ is more of a grim psychological horror where the optimism of the first two films are crushed under a near nihilistic tone persistent in this one. However it is this dramatic departure from Cameron's sequel is what gives Alien³ an edge above its predecessors. In addition to a grim storyline littered with quasi and overt religious references, Alien³ also features all of the hallmarks that make David Fincher one of the most popular movie directors around today. Those low camera angles, stark lighting and filtered colors reminiscent of Se7en, Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, are all present in Alien³, in addition to some very stunning cinematography and a haunting score by Elliot Goldenthal. The performances of the three main leads: Sigourney Weaver, Charles S. Dutton and Charles Dance, are amazing in spite of the weaknesses of the screenplay. It is remarkable that despite all this film had going against it, in its highly publicized development hell (that included a script that went through several extensive rewrites before, during and even after filming had finished), the final product is still a masterpiece, albeit a flawed one. If you watch the 'Assembly Cut' version of Alien³ , which is over 30 minutes longer than the theatrical release, you will quickly understand why it is indeed one of the most underrated, but also one of greatest sci-fi monster flicks ever made, and why it quite suitably completes the trilogy in the most fitting manner. Although many complain about the doom and gloom of this feature, this final installment in the trilogy is also the most uplifting. Looking beyond the downbeat nature of the film, Alien³ is still essentially a story about hope, and the putting aside of differences to selflessly help achieve a common good. In other words, this film is about redemption. Alien³: Assembly Cut is not only one of the best films in the franchise but it is also one of David Fincher's best efforts to date. 9 out 10.",10,61,63,21 February 2010
2012," '2012' is so last Century.
","If you take every disaster movie from the past twenty years and role them into one film, what would you get? 2012. Roland Emmirich's latest apocalyptic offering is fueled with as much references to previous disaster epics as it does with fire and brimstone – and there is a lot of fire and brimstone. Taking direct cues from his recent offering The Day After Tomorrow and last century's Independence Day, 2012 is a literal tour de force of exploding cities, country engulfing tidal waves and mass death on a biblical scale. The story is mind numbingly simple: The world's governments learn of an extinction level event due to take place in the very near future and its up to an ensemble group of characters (which for a Hollywood movie are uncharacteristically mostly African American) to find their way to safety and lead mankind to its new epoch. Emmirich seems to take pleasure in milking the world's pre and post millennial fears of the end of civilization by constantly dishing out end of the world scenarios that can give even the most optimistic amongst us nightmares. And why does he make these films? Because we as the audience will continuously lap them up. In the run up to the year 2000, popular media thrived of the world's Millennial anxiety with a series of films and TV shows based on the destruction of mankind. Then it was the X Files, Armageddon, Deep Impact, The Matrix and even the 'factual' Y2K scare. If it was not for the September 11 attacks in 2001, in all likelihood the Western World's preoccupation with the extinction of the human race would have itself, died out. However in the last decade we have had the Dawn of the Dead remake, 28 Days Later, Terminator 3, The Mist, War of the Worlds and Knowing, all echoing the social fears that came to light on that day. Those fears can be summarized under the mantra that we will all meet our Maker one day; the question is how we will meet Him? At the core of these films including 2012, is not the many spectacular ways we can all die, but of how we choose to survive and move on, even after society itself has ended. And that's what gives this genre a little gravitas. Although 2012 is nothing more than a paint by numbers CGI filled disaster epic, there are lessons of humanity that can be learned from this and other similar films. That lesson is that the real threat to the end of humanity does not come from aliens, viruses, self aware computers or even Mother Nature herself, but it comes from other humans and how we treat each other when faced with a world ending crisis. However, is it necessary to go into to this movie understanding the philosophical issues it raises? No. 2012 is equally enjoyable as CGI porn and nothing more. Turning your brain off and resigning yourself to being simply awed by the sublime images of Mother Nature reaping her destructive revenge on mankind, is enough to enjoy this film. 7/10.",6,0,0,16 February 2010
Avatar," Groundbreaking? Yes. Entertaining? Somewhat. Original? No.
","What is there left to be said about this film that has not already been said? Cameron's Avatar is probably the biggest movie ever made, both in terms of scale and content... and in budget. The millions invested to put this film on the big screen have not been wasted, as every last cent spent is obvious to the viewer. An amazing experience that has to be experienced on the big screen, and in 3D, Avatar tells the story of a group of scientists and mercenary types who go to war with a species of aliens called the Nav'i. With the mercenaries willing to do whatever it takes to obtain a fictional mineral called Unobtainium, an epic struggles ensues between the aliens and mankind.Avatar's greatness does not come from its unoriginal storyline, which is a mesh between Ferngully and Dances With Wolves, but merely from the 'wow factor' of its groundbreaking special effects. These effects are not overwhelming like other box office features such as Transformers 2, but instead are beautifully integrated; making the home planet of the Nav'i more realistic than the real world you and I live in.Although the plot treads way too closely to the aforementioned Ferngully and Dances With Wolves, while the dialog remains painfully monotonous, it is interesting that Cameron would bang over the audience's heads such obvious political statements. Its anti-war and anti-US foreign policy themes is sure to get many people upset, as a juxtaposition between this movie's story arc and the real life historical events in the Arab and Muslim world are all but subtle. Yet, regardless of one's political affiliation, this movie should still provide an entertaining diversion for two and a half hours and is truly a motion picture event that HAS to be seen on the big screen to be truly appreciated. 8/10",8,2,5,17 February 2010
