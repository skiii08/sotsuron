10 Cloverfield Lane," A film of many unpredictable turns
","So to start off with, this film is amazing and I can't imagine there being a demographic that couldn't enjoy it. You should see it if you haven't because as I just said, it's amazing. Before the film has even begun you draw assumptions about it based on its name and the previous film relating to that title. Abandon all that as much as you can, this film takes on so many forms and keeps changing direction so as to shake the audience out of those preconceptions and force you to enjoy the film for the fantastically unpredictable beast that it is. At one point it seems to be a hostage film, then horror, then briefly a buddy film, then horror again and then ends on a seemingly completely unrelated twist that will have every muscle in your body invested in the conclusion to the story.Cloverfield was a fairly good alien horror film and an OK film overall, whereas 10 Cloverfield Lane squarely surpasses any ambition and story telling skill displayed by the film it shares a semblance of its name with. This film is superior in every way and is such a roller-coaster ride of ever-changing direction that I fail to think of anything close to what it accomplishes that I could compare it to.Go. Watch. Enjoy.",8,2,5,12 May 2016
Everest," Really, really boring with no redeeming quality
","This film attracted me by way of its huge advertising campaign, brilliant cast ensemble and a thrilling premise. Unfortunately, it was very boring. The set up in the first thirty minutes seemed rather promising and although the pace and characters seemed gentle and unassuming, I assumed there might be just a little more to look forward to than the hour and a half that followed. My time could have been summed up by simply having someone explain what happened next, which would have taken no more than thirty seconds.If this film didn't have the cast it did then there is no way it would have the score it does here on IMDb. This film is not memorable and I gladly forgot it's boorish tedium by engaging myself in another film soon after.I would avoid this unless you are by virtue quite a boring person, if so, then by all means, have at it. I would not recommend this film at all. It's basically a news article clipping that has been expanded with a multitude of Hollywood fluff.",4,3,4,24 October 2015
The Witch," A fantastically immersive experience
","Any film which scares Stephen King (which this one reportedly did) has got to be worth a look- and this one is so rewarding in ways that most horror films just aren't these days. Most horror films, especially ones with as much publicity as this one, are reliant on the usual mix of jump-scares and over the top gore with not much substance at their core other than a bit of exhilarating blood-splattering fun. This film draws you into its world brilliantly through simple and effective devices like dim candlelight, claustrophobic rooms and thoroughly believable acting. It builds wonderfully and each of the horrific and eerie moments come at just the right time and aren't overdone. You become entrenched in the world of a small farm house by a big spooky woods through the eyes of the religious fervour and fears of an ordinary family in 1630. It is mesmerising, hypnotic and eerily thrilling and the faithfulness of the research done by its creators to portray the time as historically accurate is impressive. This is a film that I believe will be regarded as a classic in years to come, much in the vein of films like The Wicker Man. It is a timeless horror that will resound as much in ten or twenty years as it would have done twenty years ago. The essential elements of good filmmaking and horror story are all accounted for here. I heavily recommend this film to anyone interested in horror, history or drama.",8,4,8,18 April 2016
