The Irishman," Nice movie but...
","It's not bad movie but it's too LOOONG that at some point I had the feeling that he was trying on purpose to do it to fill up the movie to be more the 1h 30m. 2nd really bad CGI i didn't like that he tried to make Robert d'Niro, Al Pacino to look younger through CGI and he didn't used just young actors, At the end more or less original Scorsese movie nothing new. Gangster guns etc, etc",6,0,1,18 December 2019
Ready Player One," Cool
","It's nice movie but lose a lot on the plot. At first the protagonist tell us that this platform used from people around the world, all his friends they are from his area (lame) 2nd Why the samurai and the ninja should be from Japan or Asian anyway, I found it a little bit stereotypical 3rd Why Artemis is a nice beautiful girl and not a guy? Also kinda stereotypical for movie for the protagonist to find a girlfriend 4th In my opinion the riddles for the keys should be more difficult not so easy. Nevermind the movie is ok I like the pop references and the delorean",7,0,1,18 December 2019
Pacific Rim," Nice CGI that's all
","I was 100% sure that I will not like this movie from the trailer but I choose to give a chance, at last my instinct was right. Very boring movie somewhere in the middle I wanted just to finish I was counting the minutes to finish, was so annoying,cliche movie without any character development and I didn't care about nobody if they die or not. It makes me to feel sad about this senseless movie.",1,1,1,27 May 2020
National Treasure," What is going on?
","Ok I watched this movie because I was bored and I wanted to watch something for the boredom. But really this movie is clisÃ¨ asf. At first they find this ship with his partner in artic full with barrels and bo treasure of course the barrels were full of gun powder they start searching for the treasure but they found nothing and here is the first foul why nobody complain about it everyone is cool an nobody asking about why or how is empty then cage find a clue with a riddle that he resolved it in a minute and then his associate betrayed him with the a fire from the gun powder that they threw before (whatever) then they try to steal scroll of independence and they came up with the most Hollywood way of course then the run away but the woman that she has no character develop run after them to team up at the very end (whatever). Anyway after many clues that they found very easy of course they found the treasure under the subway in New York . Hold on. UNDER THE SUBWAY IN NEW YORK....like nobody found it with digging from the subway workers only Cage. And the treasure is many statues from Egypt mostly and around the world but the most important that made me laugh was the line: 'Scroll from the library of Alexandria' That burned during Cesar's civil war in Egypt in 48 bc, well yeah it's a treasure after all (whatever)and after they found the treasure everyone was so 'ok what's next' like they don't care at all",3,0,0,21 April 2020
Marriage Story," Nice one.
","I really liked this movie the acting was great and they really put a passion in it but 1st) I got really mad with Scarlett Johansson aka Nicole
Because with her character (tell him to sleep on the couch, not having sex for a year)pushed Charlie to have an affair and she blames him after...AND ALSO HACK HIS EMAILS, 2nd) the pacing was slow but I didn't found it really one of the biggest problems, 3rd) they are really showing us how bad the lawyers are, even in the end that the decided 50/50 Nicole's lawyer said take the extra day you earn it and she said I don't want and she is said no do it...????....",8,5,7,20 December 2019
