The Rock," A remarkable action film on an epic scale
","The Rock is one of those 'today they don't make movies like this anymore' movies. A gem from 90's mainstream cinema. The Rock is also Michael Bay's best film by far to date, in my opinion. Bad Boys was a solid action film. Armageddon was almost a disaster for me except for the emotion and a few scenes, despite the cast was strong and the visual effects were jaw dropping I enjoyed Pearl Harbor, but in comparison with 'Tora Tora Tora', it was mediocre. It was grand on a massive scale, but humdrum in most parts. Bad Boys 2 was better than the first as an action flick, but it wasn't great or remarkable though. As for The Island, it was Michael Bay's the second best for me. It was solid, good story, good action, no Michael Bay extravaganza etc. As for Transformers movies, other than the first installment which was pretty fine and again solid entertainment and breathtaking special effects, the sequels were overblown, uneven, big, noisy, overdone and so on! However, The Rock is a great, stylish, classy and subtle action film. It is almost an epic who can give you goosebumps. Also the movie has an amazing soundtrack. The action is spectacular here. The direction is subtle and stylish. It has an original, very gripping story and the best Alcatraz film ever to date (better than the classic 'Escape from Alcatraz') Sean Connery is great as always, but also Nicolas Cage does an amazing job here. In those years, Nicolas Cage wasn't an action star, as I remember, his first debut as an action star was Snake Eyes, then The Rock. He is more subtle in The Rock. Ed Harris, what can I say? He rocks! Also we see 'Candyman' in the movie as one of the henchmen of the villain. The car chase sequence is one of the bests ever! Honestly, I prefer this one over all the action scenes in Transformers movies. Militarism here is handled very well. Bythe way, the film never tries to be politically correct which is good. The moments within the aircraft scene is maybe the best in the movie and now it becomes an iconic moment in Michael Bay cinema. And I will never forget those green balls!",10,1,2,26 June 2013
The Avengers," The Dream Team
","The film opens with a spectacular action sequence and you almost understand that the movie will be in epic scale that disappoints or does not, that's another story. Let's talk about the team members first! I know that I am in the minority and sorry, but my favorite Bruce Banner was Eric Bana, it is and it will be, not Edward Norton. In fact, as an actor, I like Edward Norton much more than Eric Bana, but as a character, Bruce Banner, I think that Norton didn't fit the character at all. I mean that it was like I was watching Edward Norton, not Bruce Banner, it was not convincing for me. As for Mark Ruffalo, he was believable as Banner, so better than Norton, but worse than Bana. My only personal problem with Hulk was I couldn't like this 'bad-ass' Hulk. I know that many of you will surprise when you read that, but I really tried, but I couldn't. It is not important, but also I would prefer my giant to be bigger and taller. Black Widow is, one sentence, she is so hot! Period. Captain America was better in his own movie. He is 'cold' here. I don't know he was unlikeable in this movie. As action, I can't say that his parts were bad, but it was disappointing. My favorite scene in the whole The First Avenger movie was the shield fight and in this one, there is not any scene in the same level (for Captain America) And I didn't like this new costume either. The conversation between him and the agent in the plane was realistic? or poorly written? You decide. Hawkeye is cool, but before this movie, honestly I didn't know about that character, may be because of that I didn't feel any kind of excitement towards the character. I just 'watched' him. The Iron Man is The Iron Man you know, so Thor is, but there was a minor problem about Iron Man, he was too powerful in this movie, but really too powerful! Despite the parts take place in the helicarrier feels like Star Trek a little bit, it was great, great action! The main villain of the movie, Loki has some problems as a character. It reminded me Magneto, especially when he 'finds himself' in a cocktail. It was a pointless scene if you ask me and as a villain, yes he is 'paper-tiger'. He can't be a dominating villain not because of the actor, because of the script. As for one for one fights, Whedon delivers, he doesn't disappoint! Iron Man vs. Thor fight was breathtaking, Hulk vs. Thor fight was great too. Dreams came true... However, 'the battle of words' between Iron Man and Captain America was insulting for me, it was far fetched. In general the team work works. The very long final climax made the film, despite at times, it reminds you Transformers as many people realized. Yes, the cube, the machines, all these recalls Transformers, but there is the dream team, different type of action, a lot of creative ideas, better direction, better action, you just forget it or you just don't care about it. Some people ask where is the military? Well, I have two answers for that which relieve you I hope: if the military had engaged the enemy, the movie would have been just the copy of Transformers movies and the movie would have been cliché and boring. There were not S.W.A.T. also, that would make the movie cliché and boring too if you ask me. Only The Avengers and the enemy, think like that. As said before, I enjoyed, but didn't like Hulk in this movie. As I seen, most of the audiences loved the 'the punch' and 'the slamming' moments, even some people said these were the best moments of the whole film! Sorry, but I disagree. It was just too funny for my taste. I mean those moments ruined the tone of the film for me. Also that fight could have been a serious one, but no problem. It is like I liked this bad-ass Hulk, but also I didn't like. Another thing I disliked about Hulk was he was moving like a monkey at times and that annoyed me. The action, the one-liners, everything else was great!",9,3,7,15 September 2012
Blade Runner 2049," A fine effort, but it falls flat
","Blade Runner 2049 is a movie which is stuck between being a low key art film and an entertaining blockbuster. It is dark, but also very colorful, it is moving filled with action, but also a slow paced, philosophical film, so this contrast itself disrupts the integrity of the movie. It tries to be sophisticated but in an artsy way. By the way, I have no idea, why some people almost force us to acclaim the movie and accept the fact that it is a masterpiece? No, it is not. However, probably the most disappointing element in the whole movie for me is Harrison Ford. We don't watch Deckart in this movie, we watch Harrison Ford like he just gets out of bed, wearing a t- shirt and comes to the movie set! I couldn't see any big difference between his character in Expendables 3 and here though. His 'updated' or modernized character serves nostalgia, but he is just there.. Deckart and also Mr. Ford deserves a much better credit. I have mixed feelings about this movie, because it is not totally great as it is not a total failure. Opening scene is perfect, a cinematic triumph, Ryan Gosling shines and delivers perfectly, on the other hand, it is no more about replicants and a deadly pursuit, this sequel deals with some other subjects. This is good, because the movie isn't a bad copy of the original, at the same time, it is bad, because we move away from the 'essence' or spirit of Blade Runner concept. There is also a sentimental relationship which I don't explain to avoid spoiler, but it is just out of place and it kills the atmosphere and the dark tone of the film. Roger Deakinks, the greatest cinematographer alive does a spectacular job here, but unfortunately, the movie cannot escape being a copy of Ghost in The Shell's live action version. Both movies have very similar visual images throughout. The final showdown is unfortunately pretty bland and boring instead of being epic. Jared Leto's anticipated and mysterious character is a blank shot in the film with almost zero motivation and purpose. Joi is a cry-baby and an uninteresting character with no sympathy. Overall, Blade Runner 2049 is a fine effort, but it is an 'ok' film.",6,3,7,30 October 2017
Black Swan," A director's triumph, quintessential cinema, mainstream horror, genius writing
","Black Swan is a very original film, a fresh in the air film. Yes, there is another movie with similar themes which is Red Shoes, but other than that movie in the history of cinema, I think that Black Swan is an unique film and experience. I haven't seen such a different, genius dance scenes before in my life! It is pure cinema. The camera movements and lighting are genius thanks to Darren Aranofsky, also he creates a chilling and suspenseful atmosphere in a brilliant way. The movie is technically and visually mesmerizing, for example the ballet shoes making scene captured me. The movie is pure art, but also a great psychological thriller. The script is highly smart, it is full of metaphors and clues about the content and the lives of the characters. I think the movie's main themes are the desire of being perfect and career ambition. The mother character reminds me Haneke's The Piano Teacher, in my opinion two mothers share some very similar characteristics, but the mother here is mysterious (the other was not) Portman's acting is incredible, one of the best female performances of all time may be, Mila Kunis was also a great choice for the character and as a performance she was top-notch! Also, Winona Ryder who I don't particularly like as an actress was great in this. I couldn't solve the mystery of body scratches by the way. The lesbian scene wasn't a box office tool if you ask my opinion, its necessity is open to question, but it adds some very important aspects to the story. Also, 'was I good?' line was a clear The Family Guy wit that leaves a smile on your face. As a content, I couldn't the mystery of that lesbian scene either. There is also a climactic dance sequence and everything from editing to art direction, from sounds to meanings and metaphors, it was a brilliant experience. And after a second thought, the ending was perfect and twisted a little (an early question from another ballet dancer made us think differently about what is going on) Black Swan is one of the masterpieces of this century. It is also like the film combines mainstream suspense cinema with independent art cinema perfectly. It should have won the best film Oscar.",10,4,7,28 June 2013
Changeling," Horror by the story, impressiveness by the movie
","Where should I start? Mostly, I complain about the set designs and the atmosphere of the movies which tell stories that take place in old periods, because mostly it looks superficial, the (advanced) technical equipment of 2000s clashes with the set designs of 1930s, 1940s etc. Changeling was the first movie that I felt like it really takes place in those years (by the way, The Public Enemies was the most successful one in the sense of set design) However, the primary thing that makes Changeling a masterpiece is the script. It was perfectly written. This bloodcurdling true story wouldn't have been told better, it is a very bold movie including Clint Eastwood's direction. I believe that there are a few people who can dare to show some horrible details. Additionally, the story editing is perfect and there are many twists in the movie and it makes you flabbergasted. This is not a simply cliché a mother's son disappears and she is involved in a thriller and tries to find her son movie. And if it is, the best one so far. The true story is very original (because it is a true story?), just listening this story makes the movie worthy! and the script writer adapts it perfectly, so makes the movie original. The first half is very mysterious, but the second half, the movie becomes mysterious again and there are some sub stories, and each one is unbelievable, horrible and Eastwood shows things blatantly obvious. Direction has no flaw at all, if it had had, the movie might have missed the opportunity of being perfect. Therefore, Changeling is another example of Eastwood's perfect direction like Million Dollar Baby or The Mystic River. I liked Angelina Jolie more by this movie and liked her character a lot too. As for Angelina Jolie's acting, she was just persuasive (may be because I kept my expectations too high) In this movie, she is so beautiful too, but her beauty, her attraction is not in the foreground at all, this may sound cliché, but it was just an information, not as a positive or negative thing. As I learned, Changeling was criticized like Eastwood was not objective on some issues such as the faith of a character that I can't tell you know because of spoiler. I don't know whether Eastwood changed some details or not, but if this is a true story, probably he did not, but it was irritating and ridiculous that the movie got criticisms like this. Changeling is in IMDb Top 250, but it is still pretty underrated and the most important, it really deserves to be there, not like some other recent movies that have entered the list because of popularity. The ending of the movie is one of the most astonishing, original and thoughtful endings I have ever seen with a simple, but thoughtful last one-liner. It left me with complex feelings, happiness, sadness and impressiveness.",10,4,7,16 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," An uninspiring plot, pointless characters, poor places and so on!
","You may find me a bit weird, but if we look at my Pirates of the Caribbean history briefly, I have to do that to explain some things and to compare, I enjoyed 'The Curse of the Black Pearl', but I didn't love it as other people did. That's why I always think that it is overrated. If you remember, for a while, it was in IMDb Top 250. It was not epic or great for me (except the character Jack Sparrow) You know, you watch a movie, you like it, you are entertained, but that's all, it does not become one of your favorite movies. Then, 'Dead Man's Chest' came! It was not your typical summer blockbuster for me. I found it excellent and people was laughing at me, when I said it is a kind of masterpiece! It was one of the sequels which surpassed the original like Spider Man 2. A lot of things were improved (including Jack Sparrow character), the weaknesses were made up. Dead Man's Chest was a sunny sea adventure with a brilliant direction, a real villain, a surprising story, some epic scenes such as the escape from the island or the 'wheel' sword fight and great entertainment with some art as spice. 'At World's End' was the weakest in the trilogy, because this time, it was not even entertaining and the movie itself was so disconnected/messy. Probably, people will agree with me on 'At World's End'. Now, let's talk about 'On Stranger Tides'. It is better than the third movie, but far from being great. It brings entertainment back after the third movie, especially the first half of the movie was fun and Penelope Cruz brings beauty, but some flaws prevent the movie from being good. The Black Beard character cannot be a villain like Davy Jones, how can I say?, he is weak and not threatening. It just doesn't make you excited like Davy Jones did. 'Zombies' are ridiculous. Some other characters are pointless. The mermaids look like fashion models/the brides of Dracula from 'Van Helsing' with cheesy CGI and without any nudity rather than natural, mesmerizing beauties. I didn't understand the relationship between one of them and Philip at all. What was that? There is no sea battle unfortunately as there is no sea creature, you find lots of sword fights instead, even if the editing is too close or too fast in some of the scenes. Generally, the movie is more dark than sunny, more 'land' than 'sea' and more reality than fantasy. Probably, this is because the producers tried to make the movie more like the first movie to meet the expectations of the audiences. And the movie does not include a climactic final like At World's End or a dramatic final like Dead Man's Chest, which disappointed me seriously. However, probably, the thing that disappointed me the most is fountain of youth. It was not that beautiful and it was not mesmerizing. The place looks more like the place in the first movie, which they do the sword fight! Therefore, all my dreams about fountain of youth 'fell in the drink.' As for the captain for the chair of direction, Rob Marshall, direction had not any identity this time!",1,4,8,19 May 2011
The New World," Boring? No, just slow paced
","Cinema is an art, also it is an entertainment yes, but it makes me really sad that 'such kind of' movies are seen as dull pieces by a lot of people especially by youths. Because it doesn't serve crowds to please them. In that way, The New World is not an entertainment movie may be, there are no humorous lines, no lots of action, no typical romance, but this does not mean that it is not enjoyable. 'Nothing happens in the movie!' is the most typical statement probably used for such kind of movies or sometimes you probably come across titles like 'boooooooringgggg'. I want to confess that I am a person who does not easily get bored, in fact, I rarely get bored by a movie, but of course there are movies which I found extremely dull, but because those movies were lack of any emotion, any effect and even spirit, because I found nothing impressive, but The New World is not such a movie absolutely. I did not get bored at all, I did not get bored even a minute! Honestly, I don't always agree with people, when they call a movie poetic, probably because it sounds like pseudo intellectualism to me, but The New World is really poetic. One more confess, I am not a Terrence Malick fan, so I haven't found all of his movies great or excellent, but The New World was great and my favorite one with The Thin Red Line. The direction is great except the fact that at times the movie is a bit disconnected, between the transitions, but if we think that this is a visual poem, then it is not a flaw. This is a flowing like a river and relieving like a poem movie. No need to say that visually the movie is very beautiful, the cinematography is mesmerizing. Personally, Colin Farrell and Christian Bale are two of my favorite actors (of course this is one of the reasons that I liked the movie), but other than that, they are great actors, especially Bale and their characters are interesting. And when Bale takes on the stage, the movie becomes greater. May be, as one of the sub stories in the movie, a foreign man is captured by a tribe, at first they decide to kill him, but then something changes their mind or the foreigner falls in love with a girl in the tribe is a pretty cliché or dated idea, but it dissolves in this unusual film thanks to Malick. As a male, I had been seriously afraid of watching a dull romance, but definitely it was not! and unexpectedly, it was also free from clichés and realistic. The elegant final part that recalls costume dramas is a separate beauty, even if a twist at the end is pretty far fetched. Finally, alienation (from society, culture and by modernization) is reflected well. An adventure, a tale, The New World.",9,3,5,10 January 2011
Scarface," A misunderstood and very unappreciated film
","Scarface is a very violent and bloody film? No, it is not, even in its time. There is a very famous chainsaw scene, of course there are killings and gunfights, but these do not make the movie so violent and bloody. Especially, if we live in 2000s when some movies with extreme violence and blood have been made. For the squeamish, Scarface might be pretty disturbing, but otherwise it is just as violent as a crime movie. Then, why do people call especially Scarface violent and bloody while Goodfellas or The Godfather are violent and bloody too? I don't know. Secondly, as I see, some hate Scarface because according to them, some people, especially wannabe youths imitate the character, Tony Montana. However, the question is does it make the movie awful? Then, let's put all the gangster movies including The Godfather into a basket and then burn it. Scarface is a masterfully directed, masterfully executed, masterfully acted and visually so stylish crime film by Brian De Palma. Scarface is a so stylish movie from the cinematography to the art direction. As for the script, I think it is Oliver Stone's one of the best works as writer (especially in terms of story editing in contrast with Heaven and Earth) I agree that the movie is shallow throughout, but not flawed even a moment. It is 170 minutes approx. so as it is understood, it is an epic! What is the advantage of the long duration then? We can see the life of Tony Montana, Scarface in detail which means satisfying. The movie or the characters are not deep at all, but personally, I did not even mind it while watching, because everything else was great? By the way, sorry, but why did you expect a deep character study? It is a crime epic and if Al Pacino is one of your all time favorite actors like me and if you like De Palma's style, then there is no possible way to dislike the movie. If you did, then congratulations, you are one of a kind. Personally, I like De Palma very much, for me, he has more than one masterpiece in his filmography like Body Double or Casualties of War and Scarface is one of them. Now, it is time to talk about Al Pacino. However, before that I want to say that this is a fast moving and ''event driven'' movie, not a character driven movie, but still Al Pacino is great in this movie and he gives a great performance. Tony Montana is not someone likable, because he is always angry, so angry and he trusts nobody, but Pacino makes him one of the most remarkable (and likable?) movie icons ever. Therefore, by Pacino, Scarface was a character who I hate and also like. And there is a gunfight sequence, one of the best parts of the movie for sure, it recalls John Woo movies and it is almost obvious that Brian De Palma was inspired by John Woo. We are talking about one of the best gunfight sequences ever. It was a 'edge of the seat' gunfight sequence and it does not happen often! so the importance of that sequence especially comes from that, but of course also it is impressive, stylish and entertaining, if entertainment is the right word in this case. Lastly, I have seen the original 1932 version and it was excellent too. Both movies are excellent in its own way. It was an early Warner Bros style gangster film and and this remake is one of the best movies of all time too.",10,16,28,4 November 2010
Alien 3," We have different tastes
","Reactions of people towards Alien 3 have always seemed me complicated and weird. I can't explain this by the word hate, because it is more than hate, much more intense. Even the movies in IMDb bottom 100 have not such a bad reputation and people are much more easy to those. Long time ago, I read that Alien 3 was appreciated in Asian and Europe continents, but American and English audiences hated it. This is also so weird to me. It is said that it is because there were not Newt and Hicks for example. I don't know even who they are, probably one of them is the little girl. Why these two characters are very important? Are they main or key characters? No. In the second movie, Ripley made a friendship (a sort of) with her, so these people had wanted a tearjerker melodrama? Ripley is ugly in this movie, but she looks interesting and appealing to me with her short hair and bloodshot. Alien 3 is the darkest, the most bizarre, the most violent and the hardest sequel in the series. However, despite many people like dark movies such as Dark City or The Dark Knight and many people like also bizarre movies like the ones which Takeshi Miike made for example, they find Alien 3 disgusting, abominable. To me, this is a very stylish and appealing bizarreness. Not disturbing. And probably some of them who find this disgusting love Peter Jackson's Braindead or Saw movies? As for violence, this is not a sadistic or sick violence, it is only for showing us the ravenous alien's savagery. Alien 3 is the darkest one in the series, at the same time, it is the darkest movie ever made to me, I did not find even The Dark City that dark. I should add that this darkness did not disturb me, it was not an unappealing dark. It causes a thrilling, mysterious, frightening and the most important choky atmosphere. Some people complain about weapon matter, as if the previous movies are action-packed movies, even in Cameron's Aliens, there was not any gunfight scene almost. To me, this is a very interesting idea; what would you do, if you had not any weapon against the alien? Despite the visual effects of the alien has some defects in some moments, it still looks impressive. My first favorite scene is the scene that one of the prisoners stands in front of the crawly, big impellers and then, he finds the carcass. The never-to-be-forgotten scenes are the surgical operation scene (Ripley's decision and Fincher's great direction), the alien's attack to the infirmary, the horrible dog scene and the final. However, my favorite part is the beautifully bizarre pursuit scenes at the corridors. Fincher uses odd camera angles, a unique cinematic vertiginous experience. Personally, as a Alien movie and also as a science fiction, I found everything. Entertainment, horror, suspense... Alien 3 is my favorite movie in the series by far, we have different tastes.",10,50,51,30 December 2009
The Incredible Hulk," A pathetic attempt
","I know that 2003 'Hulk' movie by great filmmaker Ang Lee didn't please the majority, some viewers even hated it. That movie was unusual, but in a good way! When I read that some changes were made to 'improve' the previous movie, my reaction was totally negative, because I loved the first film, seeing it an artful masterwork, I love the way of Lee's storytelling and I didn't get bored even one minute! Therefore, I knew that the changes which were claimed by audience and seen as improvements would ruin the movie. It did actually for me. This Hulk movie is an entertainment popcorn flick which was made to please mass audience, especially incorrigible action fans and kids. Eric Bana was a realistic portrayal of Bruce Banner. He doesn't do something breathtaking in the movie, but he was fine and flawless in the movie. They replaced him with Edward Norton. One of the greatest actors of all time, but as Bruce Banner? Are you kidding? It is like to cast Nicolas Cage for Superman or to cast Leonardo di Caprio as Bruce Wayne! I like Bruce Banner here because I love Edward Norton, but on the other hand, we don't watch a real Bruce Banner. It doesn't feel like he is actually Bruce Banner aka Hulk. Sam Elliott was great and perfect as General Ross. William Hurt is a master, but I didn't get used to him, I couldn't like him, I couldn't hate him, as a summary, I couldn't be impressed by this new character. Jennifer Connelly was fine and flawless like Eric Bana. She was realistic, but not boring. Beautiful and talented actress Liv Tyler's Betty is unbearably boring here. I just couldn't watch her honestly. This movie has a serious casting problem. Tim Roth as a special team leader with some abilities? This must be a joke! I hate that some really talented character study actors are involved in action movies as action stars or villains. Remember Adrian Brody? However, vice versa is fine. An action star in an art film sounds exciting!The first twenty minutes of the film is like a Jason Bourne movie or a new Die Hard sequel! Entertaining to watch, but wait, this is a 'Hulk' movie! This is a comic book movie! The first twenty minutes of the film is suitable for a spy action thriller rather than a super hero movie, but that's OK due to some nice action and chase. The first action scene of Hulk is interesting and it was acclaimed by even some critics, but since the director hides Hulk from us, I didn't like that scene either. Maybe, technically, it looks little stylish, but not a big deal. The relationship between Bruce and Betty is pathetic. It is extremely boring, uninspiring, cliché and unrealistic. It feels like it was made for an episode of soap opera! Also, Hulk is like a manly, but naive boy here. He tries to protect the girl who he loves! the relationship between Betty and her father is almost ridiculous because of theatrical tone. Because, this movie is an ordinary, crowd-pleaser popcorn entertainment, but a really mediocre one! All the character motivations, damsel in distress situations, decision moments and actions are formulaic, so predictable. The action sequence in the park is the most entertaining one in the movie, I have seen it dozens of times, it is pure fun, but nothing special. If we think about Ang Lee's craftsmanship by combining art with entertainment together and stylish action scenes with the help of some brilliant editing work, 'The Incredible Hulk' falls short. By the way, it is possible that people may like the new appearance of Hulk, a grayish green color, a wrinkled skin, a naive monster who shouts 'Hulk smash!' almost with no intelligence etc. Hulk is not a little kid playing with toys. This is really an insult to this great character. The climactic final showdown in the city is a shame for CGI. Such cheesy visual effects and very poor CGI in some moments make the movie look like a computer game! The first movie was not boring, but slowly moving. This movie, however, was very boring other than the action scenes with the pathetic love story and some terrible CGI. In the second half, this movie can be labeled as a monster movie also, but a boring one with poor effects and some poor writing. After Ang Lee's smart, deep and powerful transformation story including a father son clash, but this must be for kids! Hulk is like a monster with little brain here and this must be an insult for our brains. Betty is in every action scene and mostly she cries! What an annoying piece of idea! Because it kills the suspense. Some people claim that Hulk is the strongest here, but I felt just the opposite. It was the first time for me to worry about Hulk getting hurt. Overall, this is a slightly enjoyable action film, but a really terrible super hero film!",1,4,9,27 July 2016
Iron Man 3," The inappropriate tone and motivation for a comic book movie make it the worst
","Unfortunately, Iron Man is the worst installment of the trilogy by far because it works more like a parody of Iron Man. I had expected something different, brilliant, genius etc. from Shane Black, 'a breath of fresh air' but instead the movie was like an unlikeable parody as said with lots of further disappointing material! Despite I didn't find the first Iron Man film perfect, masterpiece etc. at least it was cool and solid. Yes, if I have to define the first Iron Man film with two words, that would be cool and solid! The second film was found mostly disappointing including me, because the main problem of the second movie was there was no 'spark' in the movie (no pun indeed), it was lack of spark, suspense and excitement and it was more like a comedy drama than an action packed film. However, this is much worse. Most of the film consists of comedy, a little drama and Tony Stark without his Iron Man suit! In the first half, there is almost one big action sequence and that is the best sequence of the whole movie! The sudden attack part. Then, in the second half, there are a few action scenes more, but all of those are boring or unappealing. The main villain of the movie is like a joke, a result of a work of terrible writing, it wasn't genius, it was ridiculous. Probably the producers including Shane Black wanted the movie to be like The Dark Knight Rises. More realism less fantasy. More drama less action, but Iron Man 3 fails, because it doesn't work in this universe. There are more villains in the movie and mostly they looked ridiculous that somehow reminded me Superman 3. There is one more important villain in the movie and that is dated and cliché. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you may think that if there are many villains in this movie, then the movie is going to be an action feast. No! Also, if you expect a bad-ass villain, I am sorry. In this movie, Tony Stark develops a new technology related to his armor and there are some twists about that. What a terrible, uninspiring idea! There are some moments that kill the spirit or the philosophy of Iron Man, there are some far fetched or exaggerating moments near the end related to Pepper Potts etc. etc. As for Mandarin, Kingsley's performance was amazing, what an actor! As for Jon Favreau, I think he is better as a director than 'funny moments' tool as an actor. The movie is not funny, it tries to be funny in contrast with the first movie. The first movie was natural like spontaneous, the second and the third one just pushed too far. The first half of the film was pretty boring and uninspiring like the second half of Iron Man 2? Focusing on Bruce Wayne more rather than his alter ego Batman could work, I hate that either, but in this movie, it becomes the fatal mistake! Iron Man 3 is not a superhero movie, it has not comic book feel at all, the cinematography is more like a flat comedy movie except for the visual effects and don't expect Tony Stark fighting as Iron Man throughout the movie! He rarely wears his costume, mostly he runs around as Tony Stark like a detective! The climax of the film was like The A-Team (2010) with some uninspiring action scenes. By the way, the misleading trailer is just another story! Ohh, Tony Stark in the hospital, Ohh, wait, lots of action, this time it looks like a darker film etc. etc. Also there is a big, real big plot hole near the end of the film (if you saw the movie, you know what I mean) In addition, the movie tries to be politic rather than entertaining or fanciful which is beyond terrible! And this is just a guess, the young boy could be The Iron Man of the future like 'Young Indiana Jones' when Tony Stark gets old, 'quits the job' or dies. It was just a sense from me.",1,42,82,13 May 2013
Marie Antoinette," My queen is Sofia Coppola
","Of course for the people who are obsessed with historical inaccuracies, Marie Antoinette is a so so movie. I seriously get bored of this, for every war movie almost and also historical movies, people say historically inaccurate! This is disturbing to me, because the thing they missed is the movie itself, cinema! Sofia Coppola made a movie that includes no cliché and besides unconventional a bit which most people don't like. It costs her, some critics and audiences criticize her movie very harshly, did not appreciate. As for me, Lost in Translation was a very good movie, but Marie Antoinette is her best work. After Lost in Translation, I thought that she was a very good director, but after Marie Antoniette, I think that even if she is not a master, she is a great director. The Other Boleyn Girl. The Duchess. Why such movies have been appreciated? Because they met the expectations of many people that I can call mass audience. Unfaithfulness, cheating, forbidden love, betrayal. All the clichés and material which get people's, especially women's interest. Every time the same story, love triangles, a heavy story telling, everyone falls in love with each other, a man loves a woman and another woman loves this man or a man loves a woman, but later she falls in love with another man, like a boring and vicious cycle. Returning to Marie Antoinette, Kirsten Dunst is the best choice for this role and I applaud her for her extemporary acting. This character is also an anti cliché figure. Marie Antoinette is not like the women in The Sex and The City, so she does not always think of sex or shopping, shopping or sex. She is not like typical college girls, she is not fickle, she is not giddy, she is different from the girls in Tarantino's Death Proof who send and take messages night and day and always prate about their doings and men. Therefore, I loved this character. Marie Antoinette looks like a girl who tries to benefit from the boons of the palace and enjoy. Another revolutionary point is the relationship between Antoinette and her husband. In the wedding night, we get that her husband is impotent, gay or does not love her at all, even hates her. He delays her almost every night (and this makes The Sex and The City fans angry) All these shows that besides a great director, she is a great script writer. As for direction, story telling and cinematography, since Barry Lyndon, there had not been such a mesmerizing and beautiful film. The scene which we see various candles, cakes and chocolates were elegant, the scene that Antoinette and her friends watch the rising of the sun, the opera scene, the phaeton scene which we hear a pop song and the scenes take place in the animal garden are my favorites, mesmerizing, but the other parts of the film are not different too. I know why its rating is extremely low, remember, ''historically inaccurate'' people.",10,0,2,3 January 2010
Spartacus," Too plain to be entertaining and artistic which contradicts Kubrick
","Weirdly, Spartacus is out of Stanley Kubrick's style, a plain epic, visually plain, the content is plain, direction is plain... I don't know why, but I always see Spartacus and Ben Hur as like as two peas, may be so that they come from the same period. I don't compare Spartacus with Ben Hur, but it cannot be another Ben Hur, Ben Hur was much better, if you ask me. Spartacus is not a spectacular epic. The movie is not boring, I did not get bored at all, but it is not interesting enough throughout and as I said, everything is plain, in addition, there was nothing great. Except the final that I will mention later, there is not any scene memorable or impressive that I would talk about. May be I should mention the sword fight scene. There is a sword fight in the movie and it was really engaging and entertaining. However, the rest is like a straight, plain line. As for Stanley Kubrick, he is one of my all time favorite directors, but Spartacus is not like a Kubrick movie at all, you know almost every movie he made was different, extraordinary, but Spartacus is not. As you know, may be he is the most perfectionist director ever lived and his style was not distinguishable, but just impressive. In fact, it would be enough, if I just said perfectionist. However, Spartacus is an exception in his filmography. Kirk Douglas is also one of my all time favorite actors too, but unfortunately cannot save the movie. Before watching, I had known that Spartacus is not a historical action movie, no battles scenes etc. so I did not disappointed on this count, otherwise, Spartacus would have been a bigger disappointment to me. As for the final, one of the most unforgettable finals ever seen, I couldn't forget it for years.",2,9,20,12 March 2010
Resident Evil: Afterlife," An unconfirmed joke
","Resident Evil Afterlife is a 3D holiday ride, but it suffers from some serious problems especially like Apocalypse. Firstly, the battle between zombies and Alice's team is not the center of the story (we see them in two three scenes maximum) Secondly, I had not expected Shakespearan dialogs, character studies, a Kubrick-like direction or Tarantino-like camera work, but like the other sequels, cinematically, all we have are showy shots and showy slow motions. Really doesn't entertainment cinema need masterful story telling? artistic styles? developed characters and powerful scripts? If you expect more than entertainment (for example a well written script or well direction), keep your expectations very low. Paul W.S. Anderson has potential, he can do much more! (despite he disappointed some of his fans by Alien vs. Predator) In the fourth sequel, he takes the helm, he is back as the director, but this time, he is not different from the directors of the previous sequels. Thirdly, haven't the trend of The Matrix passed already? The opening sequence is like an imitation of The Matrix trilogy and there is even a Agent Smith like guy with sun glasses who is able to dodge the bullets which leave trace in the air! Can there be a bigger joke than this? By the way, more than one Alice was not a good idea, if you ask me, but the movie leaves that at the beginning luckily. This is not a R rated zombie movie (7+), so it is mildly bloody and mildly violent. May be that's why the movie's focus is not zombie human combat, instead, we watch some Matrix-like action! It is weird that the first movie is not liked even by some fans, but The first Resident Evil was subtle, simple and solid (direction and script both) Some scenes were unforgettable, remarkable, the atmosphere and make up were effective, but Anderson does not do it again. The main villain is like another ridiculous joke, in fact, it was like one of the things (difficulties) that confronts Alice rather than a real villain. Were the mutant dogs again necessary?, what was the point of those experimental people? In all the sequels, there is a guy who turns into a disgusting monster etc. The best scene of the movie personally was the scene with the giant hatchet, but also it was the most meaningless scene of the movie, who is that executioner-like thing? he works for who? what is the aim of him? Except the opening sequence, almost till the second half, I can say that there is no action, but this does not mean boring. It is a great pleasure to see Milla Jovovich as Alice on the screen again, one of my favorite actresses, I am not a 3D expert, but 3D was completely satisfying (despite I closed my eyes at the attacking dog moments) but no more than that, but it seems that children, some teens and the incorrigible fans will love this movie too.",1,26,54,10 September 2010
Deja Vu," An exact deja vu
","I seriously get tired (bored) of some stories, because the stories of such movies are always the same, nothing new or different and some of them is lack of entertainment or action or both which is unbearable. We go to the cinema or buy DVDs to see action movies or thrillers and to be entertained, but... Deja Vu is the most tasteless action thriller ever made to me which is surprising because the director is Tony Scott who I enjoyed almost all of his films that I have seen so far. The movie looks good, but not stylish. The movie was not fun at all to me, because many parts of the movie take place in a research center, scientific institution where Carlin spends most of his time to illustrate the case. I very seldomly call a movie boring, but these scenes are boring, there is only one, yes one action scene in the movie which we can see almost nothing, because Carlin sees the present and the past at the same time in this action scene. This scene is also pretty short. I don't know how can I explain this, but the movie was crude a sort of. The action thrillers about time travel are usually very bad, even if it is not as bad as Deja Vu, Next was very bad, but at least pretty enjoyable. The plot of the movie is based on a psychopath who detonates a bomb in a cruise ship and a cop who tries to stop him. What a cliché and banal story, oh dear, extremely dated. Didn't they realize that the story itself is a real deja vu? Why they don't give up writing same stories about a man who detonates somewhere and people who race against time? The Dark Knight was the same either, wasn't it? Almost all the people who watched the film say it is a fun ride. Is it?",1,12,21,19 December 2009
Gravity," I couldn't see anything unconventional in this film except a few beautiful shots
","I saw the movie in IMAX 3D (despite the fact that I am not a fan of it) and the experience itself was effective, yes, but the film was not. The film was visually beautiful, but not that dazzling except two scenes (the beginning and the 'octopussy-like cords' scene. Honestly, as said despite I found the movie visually beautiful, it was not a jaw dropping visual feast in contrast with the hype. For example, The Tree of Life was much better visually or Holy Motors. In terms of 'space experience', I prefer Into The Darkness as a recent sci-fi film (it was not perfect, but near perfect as a sci-fi blockbuster) and 2001 from the past, the mother of all sci-fi movies. Children of Men is a masterpiece for me, and it was a brilliant film from a genius director, but I couldn't see or feel that in Gravity. The idea is brilliant, but the movie is not unconventional to carry this idea. This is not an offbeat film, there are just a few 'different' angles and shots, the editing in some scenes is impressive, but all these are technical aspects of the film, so is this enough? What about the story, what about the decisions (some silly decisions) of the characters, what about their motivation or what about their weird reactions just to affect or manipulate the audience? I am a Clooney fan, also I really like Mrs. Bullock (when I was a kid, I fell in love with her when I watched The Demolition Man), so seeing these people in the movie was a joy for me, but after a while, the movie turned into a conventional space drama thriller like Apollo 13 or even Red Planet (by the way Apollo 13 is a great film), but wasn't this movie supposed to be an offbeat space film? or at least an original film? Just the idea is original here, not the execution or the story, especially the development and the conclusion part of the story are pretty typical. The atmosphere could have been more uncanny, the situations could have been more suspenseful, the story could have been darker and the story could have been more mysterious. The spiritual background of the film was not that deep, just a few obvious symbols and themes, that's all. The movie was rather far-fetched than being subtle in transferring emotions and ideas, also it was rather 'mechanic' than a thrill-ride. This is not a psychological film, because there is no time for that, the film was too short maybe and I didn't find the film inspiring including the finale. Gravity is not the new 'A Space Odyssey'.",3,4,10,28 January 2014
The Big Lebowski," I couldn't be one of the fans of it
","I have no idea why this film is loved by many including critics all around the world, and it is seen as a masterpiece for some. The story is pretty interesting, it is a nice film, there are Jeff Bridges, John Turturro and John Goodman and even more, John Goodman is very funny as usual, in my opinion, the most funny character in the movie, Jeff Bridges is cool, but no more than that. Moreover, this is not a comedy, this is black comedy, no problem, but I just try to say that 'the hype' doesn't say that. The hype is problematic also. Some critics write that it is one of the best examples of pure cinema. Sorry, but this is not a Kubrick or Tarantino film. I don't call a movie as pure art so that the camera follows the bowls which roll over! I couldn't see anything great in the movie. As known, the movie has big fans who saw the movie again and again, but never got bored! At the end, there is a speech. It ruins the movie for me a sort of. Therefore, a humorous and entertaining film, but it is not great, it is not a piece of art or it is not brilliant. One of Coen's disappointing movies unlike No Country for Old Men and Barton Fink.",4,7,18,22 December 2009
Fight Club," The world's greatest movie?
","Fight Club is a phenomenon of popular culture, maybe a cult classic, a miracle for some, but is it really that great or a mind blowing cinematic journey? or a real piece of cinema? No, it isn't. Maybe, Fight Club is little thought provoking including some 'cool' aphorism or lines, but it is Fincher's most mainstream work and designed to be understood by everyone because it is a 'product' of popular culture. I know that why is Fight Club appreciated and loved in that grand scale by population, because it is so called a 'cool' movie. Brad Pitt plays a tough alpha male, Helena Bonham Carter plays a reckless femme fatale, there is rebellion, disobedience, 'fight clubs', cool lines, etc. with a fast and dynamic editing. Fight Club is considered as a criticism of consumer society, capitalism and modern community, but there are movies which do that criticism better: A Clockwork Orange, Sidney Lumet's Network, Charlie Chaplin movies, even Watchmen! By the way, there is a twist about a character in the movie, but if you think about it, it just doesn't make any sense and that makes the movie illogical. The ending which is considered one of the best endings ever is lame and controversial in many ways. Fight Club underlines and explains its will and subjects in a loud way. This is not a subtle film, so it is little didactic and there is not any unforgettable scene to watch over and over again like some other great movies. I prefer even the director's Zodiac over this, a masterfully told, great piece of cinema.",6,1,5,28 January 2010
Citizen Kane," It is not the ninth wonder of the world
","Citizen Kane is in all the lists of the bests, according to many critics and audiences also, it is the greatest film of all time, because probably, technically or in other words, in terms of direction, it progressed cinema. However, I believe that it should be evaluated as a film, I mean above style, content and story. Citizen Kane is a good classic, yes its direction was beyond its time by far, but nothing more. It is an interesting biography of a newspaper businessman, an interesting work, but nothing more. And as I see, critics love this film more than us, because as said, they try to evaluate it in a objective way, it promoted cinema, so a masterpiece. Orson Welles's not only Citizen Kane was beyond its time, there are some other examples, especially, the story editing of Kane is beyond its time, brilliant (the story telling method used in the movie is not similar with any movie you have ever seen, from a picture projector, Kane's life is summarized!), but generally, as a film, it is just good, a plain movie. By the way, the people who see it the greatest don't explain why it is the greatest. Because, they cannot find any reason? The film is stylish visually and in contrast with a lot of people, I forget rosebud completely while watching the movie, because it swept me away. It is not the ninth wonder of the world. The eight wonder of the world was King Kong movie and almost it was in adventure genre. I am very happy that this is not 1st in IMDb Top 250.",6,3,6,4 January 2010
Memento," Its rating gets some other movies lose their meaning
","You know that IMDb Top 250 is always discussed, the overrated movies, the underrated movies, the movies which should be in the list, the movies which should not be in the list etc. I believe that movies like Memento causes a problem. The ratings of some other movies lose their meaning. They cause some other movies lose their worth. Memento has one of the most smart, brilliant and complicated scripts of all time and also the story editing of the film is the same, it must be very hard to make, as known, the story begins from the end and retrogresses, in terms of direction, it is well, but no more than that, so a good movie, a good crime thriller. The tone of the movie is 'independentish'. I don't say this in a good way or in a bad way, but it just looked me interesting. Even if I could not understand it exactly, there is also a twist at the end. I recently saw The Machinist which I can call Christian Bale's Memento, it was a pretty good movie, but there were plot holes, but there is not in Memento, so I appreciate the effort, but it is neither one of my favorite movies nor a great movie. If its rating had been 7.7 or let's say 8.0, it would have been welcome. Probably it is because the script was brilliant, I agree, but as a movie, generally 8.6 is extremely over.",6,8,16,9 January 2010
Inglourious Basterds," It has its moments, strong cinema feeling throughout, but the humorous tone and the 'deja-vu' revenge story cause disappointment
","Inglourious Basterds was a little bit, in fact quite different film than previous Tarantino films which disappointed me at theater personally as a fan of him. The movie has one of the greatest opening sequences ever filmed, it proves how genius Tarantino is, but unfortunately the rest of the film was a let down after this sequence. This sequence is an example of quintessential cinema, pure genius. The vision and the mastery of the director shine such as the timing of the camera down or the suspense, atmosphere or the acting, it is a perfect sequence, but as said the movie was lack of the magic that this part had. For example, the revenge story in this movie was a little bit bland or lack of spark, especially in comparison with Kill Bill. Also, the similarities between the two stories make it even worse! (blonde avenger, the same songs etc.) In addition, the heroine of this movie was not likable like The Bride, she was rather cold that's why I couldn't identify with her throughout the movie. Christopher Waltz's performance is jaw dropping, incredible, however Pitt is not 'so so' as some people claim, he is great too! I have no idea why some people doesn't accept that he is a very talented actor. His performances in 12 Monkeys, Burn After Reading and Tree of Life were Oscar worthy for example. Diane Kruger is the third best of the cast, her subtle performance is outstanding. Returning to the film, the movie was somehow 'cold' in comparison with other Tarantino movies and that annoyed me. I don't say soulless, but somehow lack of any real spark except for the famous opening sequence or let's say the movie was lack of emotional involvement. The violence in the movie was very brutal, so unbearable at times, but that's OK. Some action scenes are stylish, but some of those are not, too brutal and raw like the baseball bat scene. If the point of those kind of scenes is to disturb audiences, yes it delivers! Hitler was portrayed in a comical tone which harms the seriousness and realism of the movie (in contrast with the movie, Valkrie for example) He just shouts people around him. I hate Eli Roth because of his sick and sadistic director identity, but his persona and his role suits him very well in this movie and he works as a post-modernism tool of Tarantino. The camera usage in the translation scene was another example as Tarantino highlights 'cinema' over everything else. The villain of the movie, Hans Landa was a great character study, however, until the end, somehow the character lost his mystery? impact? And one of the biggest disappointments for me was the theater sequence because of the over humor or the funny tone. I had expected a suspenseful, exciting or even interesting climax, but instead got a sequence that works more like a parody! May be Tarantino tried to make his own Stalag 17 or Dirty Dozen (both movies have funny moments which I don't like particularly either), but comedy just doesn't work in this movie. Another problem was the confusing and controversial aspect of the film. In a scene, 'a good guy' of the film torments a woman to get some information, he is a hero, also an anti hero, may be both may be neither of them! In another scene, a German soldier who has a wife and a baby gets shot, in those scenes, I know, Tarantino tries to throw us a curve, but personally I wasn't amazed, instead frustrated. He did the same thing to the relationship between the heroine and another German soldier, I won't go further not to spoil anything, but many twists in the movie didn't amaze me as the director would expect or wish. However, the last twist at the theater shows that Tarantino doesn't take any side or has some ideological thoughts, instead his only purpose is to amaze or surprise audiences and gets applause! The bar sequence was great, it shows us again that Tarantino is a dialog expert for sure! The 'deserve' scene was stylish and also powerful. The 'hot' climax was unfortunately lack of suspense, excitement or real action. At the end, if he can rule his ego a little bit, if he can forget about the cheers that he would want to get, instead focusing on his art, sure he will make much better movies.",5,2,4,9 May 2013
Iron Man 2," An Iron Man film without any 'spark'
","Iron Man 2 focuses on humor, rather than action or excitement and this causes the movie to be mild. Iron Man 2 is entertaining, but entertainment comes from humor most of the time. Therefore, Iron Man 2 is more like a Saturday show, a Saturday night entertainment than an exciting super hero movie which has a lot of action. Probably it is because the director, Jon Favreau is a director who made comedy movies like Elf or Zathura and the screen writer is the writer of Tropic Thunder, then much (sometimes too much) humor is inevitable. This is what Iron Man 2 has. In addition, the execution and the story were better in the first installment. However, there is a more interesting villain played by great Mickey Rourke (even if even this character is mostly passive throughout) The villain of the first movie was a businessman as known. There are some great visuals, War Machine played by Don Cheadle is included in the team, there are nice cameos like Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johannson is really sexy. There are a few real wow moments and most of them are in The Grand Prix scene. It was the best scene of the movie to me. It could have been longer, but it is definitely satisfying. However, till the final part, you have to wait, if you want to see action. Probably, directors have started to believe that in an action movie, if there is less action, but more drama, the movie becomes more deep and more serious. Some people call this as Spider-Man 3 syndrome. Iron Man 2 suffers from this syndrome at times, in the middle part of the movie. It makes us feel like we watch a comedy drama and this is not surprising, because as I mentioned, the director of the movie is Jon Favreau who made comedy movies, played in comedy movies and the script writer of the movie is Justin Theroux who wrote a comedy before, Tropic Thunder. As for the characters, Robert Downey Junior is again the star of the movie, but he was more funny, cool and witty in the first movie. Natasha Romanoff played by Scarlett Johannson is passive most of the time, the operation scene was entertaining, but it is sad that this character consists of a few showy acts. Ivan Vanko (Rourke) is not a wasted character like Natasha Romanoff, but mostly he sits down and masterminds the chaos. Then, he is included in a disappointing and too short final fight (a few minutes) It starts and finishes in a trice. There are three action parts in the movie. The first one is The Grand Prix scene, in the second one, Iron Man and War Machine are included in a chaos (pretty long) and the third one is the final fight. As a result, Iron Man is very humorous at times, entertaining at times, otherwise disappointing.",4,5,11,10 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," a masterpiece of blockbuster
","I don't like audience driven, crowd pleaser movies at all, but Dead Man's Chest is not one of those even if it comes from mainstream cinema. That's why I think that it is a masterpiece. Its low rating is not understandable for me. Critics don't like blockbusters, because probably they cannot see art in those movies and there is one more reason, because they think that those movies are rather 'products', in other words commercial. Other audiences found this sequel very disappointing in comparison with the first film. The problem here is Dead Man's Chest is not such a movie, so is it a bad hype? I guess so. It is entertainment, everyone knows this. and yes, the movie is not an art house film may be, but it does not mean that there is no art in it. Gore Verbinski is a very good director, even if I did not like all the works he made. As said, according to many people, Dead Man's Chest is far inferior in comparison with Curse of the Black Pearl. This is very funny, because I think just the opposite. Black Pearl was overrated. I slightly enjoyed it, but in my opinion, Dead Man's Chest surpassed the first one, because it improved it. As mentioned, direction is very outstanding, coasts, sea, islands, a sunny entertaining experience. One of the best and most enjoyable parts is the part that we see Jack Sparrow as the chief of the tribe! It is a bit meaningless, but welcome. Visuals, the set design are great. As for Johnny Depp, he makes this sequence more colorful. He looks very interesting. I watched the escape attempt part tons of time, it deserves entertainment anthology in cinema. I love everything in this part with some paprika and exotic fruits. Musics are coherent with the content which does not happen often, it seems audience driven may be, but I just did not care about it. The music winds us up. The only problem is that the dog humor is dated and naive. The ghost sailors in the first movie were fun (but with a little cheesy visual effects. This time, we see various very interesting sea creatures with outstanding CGI. Personally, I enjoyed much more. Davy Jones. I liked that character and also yes he looks disgusting, but in a good way. Some of my friends could not look at him when I showed them a picture of him, but he is not that disgusting. I was very impressed by the music box scene, it was brilliant. If there had been no art in the movie and if Verbinski had been a bad director, we would not watched such a scene, believe me. I have not seen a better sea battle so far than the ones in this movie. I can't describe it more, it is such great. It does not finish. The sword fight in the white sand island is my all time favorite sword fight. I watched it hundreds of time. This part is my favorite in the movie I guess. Great fun. Musics, the flamboyant forest. I just love it. Like the sea battles, this fight is very long also. There is one more big sea battle with Kraken. The best Kraken is here. It is so exciting and bothering at the same time. Again, there is a moment, moire by sun, it seriously impressed me thanks to Verbinski, brilliant. Ohh, I forgot to talk about Johnny Depp himself. His performance is outstanding, but also Jack Sparrow in this movie is much more colorful, eccentric, funny and interesting than Jack Sparrow in the first movie.",10,1,3,16 February 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A good, but overrated movie which was improved on all counts in the sequel
","The Curse of the Black Pearl was almost loved by many critics and according to some of them, it was a masterpiece. Then, why? You know, critics don't like such kind of movies, the movies which they call blockbusters, they underestimate such kind of movies and don't give high ratings. Even the sequel can be an example. As I see, they did not like the second movie as many people did not. Firstly, I want to say that I don't categorize movies as blockbuster and non blockbuster. What I am trying to say is that Curse of the Black Pearl has nothing different or unusual that would make even critics appreciated, instead, it was engrossing, entertaining, but a so so movie. Just another adventure movie. I slightly enjoyed it, it was entertaining, but mildly entertaining, so I cannot say a lot of fun here. I had expected much more by trailer. I think that I can tell my thoughts more clear above The King Arthur. Curse of the Black Pearl is such a movie. I was entertained by The King Arthur, but just by some scenes, it was not uninteresting, it was engrossing, but no more than that. I had rented it, watched, was entertained, then gave it back. It was a so so movie, it was not a new Gladiator, it was not a new Excalibur. This first movie, Curse of the Black Pearl is such a movie, if you ask me. It is an engrossing pirate movie with ghosts who look like flesh and blood, but turn into ghost by moonlight. Cool! As for Johnny Depp, one of my all time favorite actors, Jack Sparrow is remarkable, interesting, but he cannot even touch Jack Sparrow in Dead Man's Chest. In the sequel, this character is much more interesting, eccentric, colorful and funny. However, his performance in all The Pirates of the Caribbean movies is outstanding, especially in the second movie! Jack Sparrow hides a secret, it is unfolded at the last part, but it ruins the character, it kills the humor of the character. I was just disappointed, but not so important. Before the sequel was released, I had been sure that the second movie would surpass the first movie by far on all counts and I was not mistaken about it.",6,1,4,16 February 2010
Spider-Man 2," My dreams came true, but partially
","I watched almost all the episodes of classical Spider-Man animated series and I am familiar with the comic book, even if I did not read it, just a few of them. Like The original The Batman animated series, Spider Man animated series is a masterpiece, on all counts, characters, story, story editing, script, direction (or should I say drawings) etc. As for the adaptations, I have never thought that Sam Raimi is the right guy for this project. Yes, sometimes, there might be exceptions, an unexpected director gets an unexpected success, but I believe that someone who has a grasp of the field should take the project. However, as said, there might be some exceptions, positively or negatively, for example, Bryan Singer's X-Men movies were great and he seemed a perfect choice for Superman Returns, but it was a huge disappointment. Sam Raimi did a good job, but particularly. Spider Man 2 surpassed the first movie by far, but I had been almost sure for that, especially technically, so did not surprise. As for expectations (dreams) the movie meets some. Tobey Maguire makes us believe that he is Peter Parker /Spider Man and I have no complaint about that, but pretty different from the original character, not only in terms of appearance, but also in terms of personality. The original Peter Parker character is beefy, this Peter Parker is so thin, he is a bit glitzy boy and not a loser exactly like Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker. There is one enemy, Dr. Octopus in the movie, in the comic book and the animated series I love, as you know, Spider Man fights more than one enemy at the same time and it causes amazing moments. Sadly, some people complained about this in Spider Man 3, so the filmmakers have sworn not to make room for more than one enemy. However, to me, absolutely, the problem is not this formula does not work, it is the fault of the directors. In Spider Man 3, it did not work because of Raimi and script, especially you know Venom stuff. However, Tim Burton did, didn't he? (Batman Returns, The Catwoman and Penguin) Some details are also missed in Raimi's Spider Man movies. These details might be not important for some people, but they are a part of dreams (expectations) For example. Spider Man is a chatterbox, so he talks with himself while flying or fighting his enemies. Sometimes, he makes jokes about the situation he is in and those lines are very humorous. In the movies, we have none. Sam Raimi creates his own world, makes his own humor, the tone of the movie, the atmosphere are not based on the comic book or the animated series, it is far different. Spider Man movies, the first, 2 and even 3 are great fun, also feel yourself good movies at times, but every time I am upset because of those. Raimi cannot adapt the mood, the atmosphere and the humor. Visually, yellow tones are dominant, in the comic book and the animation, visually, it is great. How is called? Use of city. Raimi cannot use of city well. Now, let's about the content of the movie. There are some brainwave moments in the movie like the stained clothes in the launderette. The first short action scene shows the improvement of the movie, so technically perfect, it is a very stylish scene also. The platonic love between Parker and Mary Jane is realistic, I mean one sided love. Thankfully, Raimi makes Spider cruise in the air, those images are dazzling, he does not miss this detail as he did some other ones. However, personally, it was not enough for me, because I just love that, so it could have been longer, it should have been longer. However, there are some too unrealistic moments in the movie, for example, he tries to jump from a roof to another, but falls down. All your bones are broken and you die! Or he is not shocked when he pulls out the plugs. The positive hype of the hospital part is true, in this part, even if you don't know who is the director, you understand it is Sam Raimi. J. Jonah Jameson is cartoonish unfortunately, he imitates him, does not interpret him. The first big action sequence is one of the best sequences of the movie, to me second best. It is very very smart, especially the choreography and editing, very brilliant. And perfection in visual effects. In terms of action, yes Raimi's movie meets all the expectations and dreams come true. Action is a bit less, but satisfying and the movie was not boring. The second Spider Octopus fight is the best action sequence of the movie and my personal favorite. Again very brilliant choreography and very brilliant editing. Real amazing. However, Raimi uses some showy tricks like the forward traveling to the end of the rail (Batman Begins used it too) And another illogical, unrealistic stuff. Your leg is real seriously broken, if you do that! even further injury may be. He is not Superman. A problem of the movie is that Peter Parker is a very thin and the most important feeble boy, but when he wears Spider Man costume and becomes Spider Man, he becomes very powerful as if he is the son of Superman!! This really flaws. Then, some real touching (and humorous) moments. There is something in it. Returning to the relationship between Parker and Jane, realism is ruined and fantasy takes the place of it. Remember, ''tiger'' People at theater laughed, I remember.",7,1,2,28 March 2010
The Fifth Element," Like a rainbow
","Probably, the rating of the movie is such low, because it is not a serious science fiction, otherwise, it is one of the most enjoyable and colorful science fiction movies ever made and if you ask me, humor in it is not uneven. By the way, Fifth Element is one of my all time favorite science fiction movies. However, it is clearly seen that almost many people don't appreciate it and some find it ridiculous. The science fiction movies that made after 2000 were mostly disappointing such as Mission to Mars, Red Planet, Sunshine etc. As for Pitch Black, it was good, but forgettable. What I am trying to say is that to make a successful science fiction movie is not that easy. The plot of the movie is not deep may be, but creative and not childish. There are a few scenes I love and watched hundreds of times, because never felt enough. The first one is the scene which Leeloo jumps over, the following part is extremely enjoyable. Willis's car is one of my favorite engines in movies and the blue ones also, the design of them is very appealing like some other designs. My second favorite is the song part, in my opinion legendary, the song was reposeful and the scene was inventive. The third one is the best action scene of the movie, the gunfight scene at the saloon of the ship. Lots of people hate the character Ruby Rhod, almost everyone who has seen the movie talks about him like he ruined the movie, I liked the movie except for Ruby Rhod etc. This is really sad. He was an extremely funny and amusing character and Chris Tucker does not look superficial and his best performance so far as well. Therefore, I LIKED him. By the way, the movie is sometimes called Die Hard in space, I agree. Some designs in the movie seem childish, kitsch or flimsy like the gun of Zorg, his 'toys' in his office, the head of Diva or the monsters, but it is great fun, does not ruin the movie somehow and also it is made consciously that's the point. As mentioned, some say what a fake movie! No it is not. In contrast, visual effects of the space ships and the planets are first class. By the way, the creatures are also interesting characters and so fun to watch. The afro American guy who changes his face was a so popular and unforgettable image, still it is, if you ask me. Milla Jovovich is really a talented actress and her best performance is in this movie like Chris Tucker. As many people haven't done, I haven't forgotten ''multi-pass''. The laboratory scene is brilliant, so is her performance and every time, I bother so that her waist will broke. The city in the movie is extremely dazzling, one of the most well created cities in cinema. This is a rare thing that in a movie, every actor makes one of their bests, some of them make their best, but completely different characters from each other. As for Gary Oldman, he is one of the actors who can play every kind of character. He is almost as funny as Rhod and very interesting, amusing character, especially his accent.",10,5,10,1 February 2010
Batman Returns," Tim Burton's vision
","It seems that Tim Burton likes snow so much, because it snows in almost all Tim Burton movies. Owing to the set design and art direction, you may want to settle down in The Gotham City. However, of course the city is not pleasant always. The gloomy atmosphere, evil Max Shreck who does not know the value of his sweet, sensitive and too polite secretary, instead hates her and The Penguin who tries to ruin Batman's reputation, for example there is a Batmobile sequence, a nightmare for a child. Briefly, Burton gets you stroll in a city that is perilous but also wonderland. Batman is almost in every scene, not Bruce Wayne, Batman. I don't want to compare this with Nolan's movies, but just want to say a few things about both. This is the darkest Batman movie so far by the way. We see daylight very rarely. Batman encounters with Catwoman and Penguin many times and they square accounts with each other which is very important. Remember Two Face character's screen time in The Dark Knight. In the first action scene, we see Batmobile's tricks and want to have it as usual. In Tim Burton's Batman movies, the design of Batmobile is very stylish and appealing, despite my favorite is the one in the original animation series. You know, in Nolan's movies, they made a tank that kills the magic. The attack of the bats? Better planned and better directed than Batman Begins. The camera angles and the chaos in this scene are great. In The Dark Knight, people watched an uninspiring final fight between Batman and Joker and Joker's biggest plans were detonating two ships. In Batman Returns, yes, some people explode some places, but interesting, moreover the film has much more. Michelle Pfeiffer. Tim Burton is interested in details such as the appearances of the characters, their personalities, belongings, costumes and actions. At the beginnings, we see Selina's luminous house. She is a woman who is lonely, neglected, not well-cared for herself and waits for his prince. While observing this character, we don't think that she is a cliché character we have watched a lot of alike ones, may be because of Pfeiffer (and her acting), may be Burton's meticulous player direction, may be both. Moreover, Catwoman is not a typical character, she seems that she is a feminist, but in a scene, she injures a girl after rescuing her. It seems that she hates men, but she shows interest in Batman and also Bruce Wayne. Everyone knows that she was not comfortable in her costume, but remember pain brings victory :) Catwoman looks great in the movie. Danny De Vito with one of the most realistic, so one of the best make-ups ever made. It is impossible to believe that he is Danny De Vito. The scene he eats raw fish, the scene he drives his toy car and the scene he ambushes Catwoman are my favorites. All these things, details are not childish at all, even if they are for some people. Returning to Penguin, he is a cliché villain who hates humanity and whose purpose is destroying the city, killing all the people, but again, Tim Burton does not let us say cliché. With his multifarious weird accessories, weapons and actions, he is a character who is interpreted by Burton in great detail like Catwoman, Joker or Batman himself. Burton is like a detail expert. More than one enemy in a movie. This should not been a problem, but when Sam Raimi failed in Spider-Man 3 according to many people including me, then filmmakers and directors have been started to be afraid of doing that. Tim Burton allows enough time for both of the enemies and this works perfectly. We get to know their personalities, but also we watch them in many action scenes and still there are other characters and other stories like Max Shreck or we witness to Bruce Wayne's life, his relationships or the candidacy of Penguin and the effect he creates.",10,1,2,15 February 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Enjoyable, but cannot be a good movie because of a lot of disappointing material
","X Men Origins is enjoyable, but there are a lot of disappointing material and it is not well directed, because of all these problems, the movie cannot be good, just enjoyable. They chose a director who had not seen any X-Men movie before! After doing that, he said something like I enjoyed each movie, but I will make something different. By the way, what about saying Bryan Singer's X-Men movies were great and I will do my best. I don't try to mean that he should have repeated or copied Singer's movies, but this is egocentricity. If you ask me he had not cared about expectations so much, wanted a very good movie of his own. I thought to myself like we would watch a disappointing X-Men movie, because there were no reason to make a difference, make somethings different, because all the previous movies are successful (to me) This is an almost light movie, a light X-Men movie. Or should I say shallow, even if the previous ones were not real deep, a character study or something? Tyler Mane as Sabretooth was great to me, seems the best choice, but I don't know why, but as I read, many people disappointed. This is really funny. What was wrong with him? He was a harsh Sabretooth and was looking amazing. I did not Liev Schreiber honestly, so I disappointed with this one. Despite I am a big X-Men fan, I had not been aware of Deadpool, so after watching this movie, I searched him on the internet and very impressed. However, I did not the character in the movie, he was like the brother of Hannibal King or even like the same person. A normal dressed guy who has a sword. In the movie, he was an uninspiring (dull) character. Thus, he does not look like a X-Men member. There are also some other characters which are just showy! The Asian guy who shoots very fast or the ridiculous Mutant X. It was just a terrible idea and it ruins the whole movie and absorbs the entertainment. Brian Cox was great as Stryker, but as as the result of the tendency of reconstruction, we 'lost' him. Visual effects especially in the scenes which Sabretooth leaps are very cheesy. Blob is a character who we should not see in a (good) X-Men movie, this character makes the movie an ordinary entertainment. And Gambit. Probably my favorite character, or one of them. I had known that in any adaptation, this character would be as disappointing as it can be. In the previous movies, they did not even put him. This shows that they don't care about him, so they did not try to be very careful of course. In the movie, he is a character created in a scratchy way. Besides, his screen time is so less like Two Face in The Dark Knight. In fact more short! The actor was not a good choice, his powers were exaggerating, his appearance was 'normal', briefly, a very interesting character turns into an ordinary character. Sabretooth's behaviors are also far fetched and frustrating, I said to myself decide enough! The story of the mutation of Wolverine is wasted by a scratchy script. Only a few moments in X-2, which in a flashback, we see Wolverine with blood in Stryker's laboratory are more deep, more intense, more stunning than the whole mutation story in this movie. It was like by a few moments or one scene, Singer summarizes everything. There are a lot of reviews, in other words, many people say that X-Men Origins is much more better than The Last Stand. It shows that people are just weird. X-Men The Last Stand was disappointing in comparison with the first and the second movie, but it was very good. A brilliant opening scene (I mean child Angel), amazing action scenes, the tone of the movie recalls the comic book, visual effects were perfect and much more.",3,1,3,3 February 2010
Troy," Intellectual expectations!
","Despite, Troy is one of the best modern historical epics so far, many people including critics did not like the movie almost at all. Yes, the reason of all the people who did not like the movie is not the same, but I believe that generally this is because of intellectual expectations. It is said that the movie is very bad, because there is no mythological material, or the movie is very bad, because it is not a smart adaptation, instead so conventional. And there are also people who say that they did not enjoy it. If this is not entertainment, what is it then? Troy is not an unusual movie or it is not postmodern or an art house work, but these make the movie bad? Another director might have focused on Helen Paris love affair, then the movie would have been unbearable, but we get involved in the adventure quickly. I know that either, there are some people who hate Brad Pitt and always say he cannot act! Brad Pitt is a great actor. To me, he proved that in Jesse James and Burn After Reading. And his performance in Troy is one of his bests. He reflects his character's power, arrogance and extreme self confidence. And watch the Patroclus scene and see yourself whether he is talented or not. By the way, after the killing, I hated him, he became my enemy, for a while, I even could not follow the movie. If we hated the character, it means that he did a very good job. You don't care about the characters in some movies, Troy is not one of them. The fight between Hector and Achilles is one of the most exciting and fresh fight scenes ever made. Very high adrenalin and great movements. And the mark on the shield. That is matter a lot. The fights in Troy are very critical, not only that one, but also the fight between Paris and Agamemnon. Again very exciting, high adrenalin. Paris does not know how to fight, he is too young to die and if it happens, it becomes a real pity. By the way, in a scene, Paris shows his 'Legolas side'. I said to myself, you are the prince! And the war scenes, the big war. Despite we have seen similar scenes almost a lot of times, it captures you and looks dazzling. I watched it over and over again and still do. In some moments, it is obvious that the army is CGI based, especially the opening scene and the scene which the army walk to the castle throughout the beach. However, it does not ruin the movie exactly. The sneak peek of Troy was from the scene that thousands of ships sail on and every time, it looks dazzling to me. Besides all, Troy has soul. Lastly, all the characters are human being in the movie, as mentioned no mythological material, but this realism somehow becomes an advantage instead disadvantage. Despite I love fantasy genre, realism seems a great idea in the movie.",10,21,38,6 January 2010
Ed Wood," Tim Burton's Otto e Mezzo
","Tim Burton's movies are colorful, visually and spiritually both. His movies are art and entertainment, a mixture of both. May be he tells the best tales. He is one of my all time favorite directors, even if he made a few disappointing movies to me like Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. One more thing about Charlie, it was disappointing, but Johnny Depp saved it. As for Johnny Depp, he is a 'colorful' actor you know, almost all the characters he played were colorful and eccentric. As you know, Tim Burton worked with him a few times and people call this Burton-Depp corporation. Ed Wood is a black and white film. In any case, it does not matter at all, but a black and white Tim Burton film doesn't work at all. There is nothing interesting or dramatic in Ed Wood and the movie was lack of real entertainment and art so it is tasteless like Fellini's Otto e Mezzo. The plot, if there is a plot, it is uninteresting. Ed Wood is not that bad like Otto e Mezzo, but I hardly finished it. Johnny Depp was unbelievably not interesting and his performance was amateurish, he was like an amateur who tries to be Ed Wood or imitates Ed Wood. I disappointed. The other actors are between existence and non existence except Martin Landau. Especially, for Bill Murray, if you saw him in Broken Flowers or Lost in Translation, probably you will say that No, this is not Bill Murray or he is not in his mood.",1,4,21,4 January 2010
X-Men," Perfection
","Unbelievably, I have recently learned that some people don't like this first movie very much. I don't know why, because I did not want to learn, I will just write what I think. X-Men is the best one in the series including X-Men Origins Wolverine by far, even if the second one is deeper and it comes from perfect direction mostly. The movie is very consistent, no uneven material it has at all, it is very stylish and very enjoyable also. The tone, the atmosphere of the movie are so different from the comic book or/and the animation, it is like Bryan Singer creates his own X-Men world, but somehow, it does not turn into a flaw or disappointment. Visually, it looks like a thriller rather than a (colorful) fantastic super hero movie, but this works somehow. Personally, I did not complain about it. Instead, it makes the movie eccentric, idiosyncratic. I like the snowy shots and despite it is short, one of the best action scenes of the movie, the fight after the accident. As for Magneto, Ian McKellen was made for Magneto (and of course for Gandalf too) As I know, some people complained about Sabretooth, but may be even if he was not made for the character like McKellen, Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Halle Berry as Storm, Tyler Mane looks great as Sabretooth. I saw the original character, I watched the animation, but I don't know why they were not satisfied with Tyler Mane's Sabretooth, what was wrong? He is as harsh as the original character too. Halle Berry is so cute by the way. There are a few smart moments like the steel balls or the metal floors related to Magneto by the way, I liked it. The action scene takes place in the station is my second favorite. Just a note: there is a shot with a weird angle, it was amazing. Visually, X-Men is one of the most stark, plain movies ever made probably. The last parts are amazing too, we see some cool fight scenes, everyone encounters with each other. Every time it is so fun to watch thanks to Singer's stark, eccentric direction and the colorful characters. The Wolverine Sabretooth clash is not the focus of the movie, but better than X-Men Origins Wolverine. On the Statue of Liberty, there is a spiral camera shot, loved! And X-Men has much more.",10,4,9,7 February 2010
Spider-Man 3," Could it be the end of Spider Man? No, it is the end of Sam Raimi!
","Spider Man 3 is a very entertaining movie, I watched it several times later on TV, despite almost hate it, but otherwise it is a very scratchy movie and it doesn't take itself seriously, in other words, Raimi doesn't take it seriously. It seems that the script was written without so much thinking! The movie is really good when it comes to action scenes. The parts which Sandman fights Spider Man are great in terms of visual effect and editing. The scene which he is 'born' was mesmerizing and even touching. In fact, that scene was unusual for such a movie. It was pure art. As for the flaws, the metamorphosis of Spider-Man and the genesis of Venom weren't handled well. The screen times of Venom and black Spider Man were short. I don't know is it necessary to say that the actor who plays Venom was a ridiculous choice! In the comic book, as I remember, after his costume gets black, Spider-Man realizes that he has some new powers. Then, he gives some of their enemies hard time. When he sees that it is evil and controls him, he tries to get rid of it. The black substance comes to the earth by a spaceship, it infects to it, but nobody realizes. And after an accident, it finds Spider-Man. The change of Peter Parker is mentioned by two ridiculous and pointless scenes; the bar scene and the street scene that Peter Parker dances! He looks untroubled, no anxiousness etc. It is like the movie makes fun of itself or Raimi makes fun of his own movie! Raimi decreases action scenes as much as he can, because, in these years, this is the trend! Less action, much drama, focus on characters instead! However, still the movie is satisfying as an action and as said very entertaining, it has demo scenes. The movie was not slow paced, but it suffered from less action, more drama and humor syndrome at times. And may be the final action was a bit lame! Some people glorify J. K. Simmons's performance, but if you ask me, his acting was overdone. He cannot make us believe that he is J. Jonah Jameson, he tries to be like J. Jonah Jameson. In other words, it is like he imitates that character, so cartoonish. Some visual effects are flawed, especially the scene which Peter Parker fights Harry Osborn at night and the scene which Spider and Sandman fights in the metro. In the first fight, two foes fight without mask which is also the reason of bad CGI and also a bad idea! Also, there are some seriously illogical moments in this fight which a human being cannot survive. We get bored of the routine accident scenes and especially Mary Jane in danger moments. The killer of Ben Parker is far fetched and even ridiculous. In the final sequence, there are also some very illogical moments which Sam Raimi call as 'comic book reality' such as Sandman's impacts or the sticks trick.",5,0,1,3 January 2010
Resident Evil: Extinction," The only good thing is the solid direction
","Resident Evil Extinction is better than Apocalypse, but it still makes me think that why they do that? I mean bad movies? And it is very annoying that in IMDb, there are a lot of good movies whose ratings are less than Extinction, but deserve much more. The opening scene of the movie aims to surprise the audience, but it can't. There are only two good things in this film, the panoramic views and the cinematography, this is a post apocalyptic film, a movie in dust and dirt! The abominable family at the beginnings recall Judge Dredd (or Chronicles of Riddick) and it was exciting. The second and third Resident Evil movies don't focus on the zombie action and zombie horror, there are awful sub stories and characters instead. However, when I saw that the director of Extinction is Russell Mulcahy, I cheered up, because he is a cult director from 80s and 90s, he made some cult B movies like Highlander. However, he disappointed me. However, as said, the movie has a better, solid direction. As said, in terms of direction, this is much better than the second one, but still this is not a well executed and well delivered movie. Returning to the story, the people who hunt zombies for fun from a convoy was cliché (already used by Romero in Land of the Dead) The best part of the movie begins when they arrive at New York. However, zombies's make up effects are awful, there are time-lapse shots which good news for 28 Days Later fans, but bad news for Resident Evil fans! Extinction is an entertaining movie, if all you want is just entertainment. The monster of Extinction is not as ridiculous as Nemesis, but still very uninspiring, terrible looking... Why we cannot see a well done monster in R.E. movies since the first film?",3,1,3,31 January 2010
Midnight in Paris," Allen 'meets' Bunuel
","Even if it seems like that, this movie is not mainly about a tribute to some artists of 1930s or the praise of the city, Paris, this movie is a criticism of the bourgeoisie, lack of communication, egocentricity and selfishness. And it is about a man who doesn't belong to that 'world'. Before starting my thoughts on the film, I want to say that I have no idea why a lot of people hate Owen Wilson and they say that they couldn't stand him! I like Owen Wilson! I like him and he was one of my reasons of watching this film, because I am not a Woody Allen fan and I have seen a few of his films so far. Years years ago, when Wilson played in an action movie, Behind Enemy Lines, again, people said he was awful, but it wasn't true (if you ask me) Anyway... Midnight in Paris is one of the most offbeat movies I have ever seen in a good way and surprisingly it reminded me Bunuel films like Le Charme Discret De la Bourgeoisie. I don't know Allen did it intentionally or not but what a coincidence, there is a fictional Luis Bunuel in the film! When I saw A Streetcar Named Desire, like many people, I couldn't understand that Brando was the villain until starting to think about it after the movie. This movie is not the same, but similar. Inez is 'the villain' of this movie! She doesn't care about her fiancé, she doesn't give value to him, she 'carries him like a bag'. She is selfish, egocentric. She doesn't think about pleasing her fiancé, she makes herself happy, always! She cheats Gil, just because she wants to do, just because she wants to have an 'adventure'. It seems that probably, this will reflect badly on their sexual life when they get marry! She is a spoiled girl by her bourgeois family. She goes shopping with her mother (a reference to shopaholic women?) We see her and her family while doing an activity always. However in a repellent way. The bourgeoisie consists of 'enjoying the life all the time, this is what the movie tries to say to us I think. Therefore, this couple is not like the couple in Before Sunrise! While Gil is talking, Inez is always busy with doing something, she doesn't 'listen' him, because she doesn't care about him. Paul, a friend of Inez, is an intellectual, may be a pseudo intellectual (I've never figured out the thin line between the two), but it feels like he is a smart Aleck, this is the fact. There is a scene. Gil interprets some paintings and Paul (also Inez) get down! You know, in fight movies, in a neighborhood, there is a weak child who is always beaten by the other boys. Then, by a miracle, he meets a master, the master teaches him to fight and at the end, the child kicks their .ss! That painting scene in Midnight in Paris feels like that for me. Gil does not belong to that world, the world of Inez, the world of Inez's family, the world of bourgeois. At this point, Allen opens a door of 'another world' to Gil. Salvation from that life! Even the artists in the past give Gil value, more than his fiancée! Adriana... What a woman! She is a very dominant woman, she is a woman like a woman, but she 'listens' Gil, she cares about Gil, she doesn't nag at him or lecture him like a child as his fiancée does! Inez is a scolding girl, she is a shrew, Adriana is a 'female'. As for the characters in the past, another great success, No overacting, No cartoon-like character and No farcical moment! However, the only flaw, Allen can't conclude the past successfully, he just 'leaves' it. Let's talk about the Inez's family. Her mother hates walking in the rain, because she is too self indulgent like other bourgeois people. They always want to do an activity, but always! What they don't think or care about is other people including their daughter's fiancé! When they suppose that the earrings are stolen, they suspect the maid, they despise the maid and the most important, when Gil implies he wants to break up, her reaction is 'here is the door!' She doesn't cry, she doesn't try to stop him, she doesn't feel upset, because she doesn't even care about that! Then why? She doesn't want to sadden herself. Thus, Midnight in Paris succeeds in something which Titanic couldn't! And there is another girl, the third girl, she is a saleslady. Gil meets her, she likes walking in the rain (get it?) She is too imaginary to be real and at the same time may be she is too real to be a dream. She is not like Inez as she is not like Adriana. At the end, her and Gil go for a walk. Even if this is a very cliché final, the message behind it is worth saying!",9,0,0,10 April 2012
Cloverfield," A lot of people say that they hated it, probably just to be opposite
","This is not a movie which tries to get people's attention in order to do well at the box office. In other words, what people call, not pretentious. J. J. Abrahams is one of this movie's producers, but Cloerfield was not appreciated, even the half of it as Star Trek was appreciated. Instead, there are a lot of people who say that they hated it and there are a lot of people either who give it only 1! There is not even one flawed moment in the movie on all counts and acting that is criticized by the haters is not amateurish at all. I did not understand why it is criticized. All the actors and actresses are amateur, but the acting is not amateurish, very persuasive. Cloverfield is extremely realistic that makes it much more effective. It is because all the things seem extremely realistic, how is it called? Documentary style. The most unusual opening sequence for such a movie is in Cloverfield I guess. The mood, the atmosphere are very interesting and it is like someone records a party rather than the director introduces the characters of a monster movie to us. Therefore, it starts like a stylish drama. However, it is not like party, girls, drinks, chats and music, something different. I just can't describe it. Because of realism? or because of another reason? I don't know. As for the first attack, I haven't seen such an engaging and impressive one before. This is much more than panicked people run and scream and a monster attacks them, really it is too hard to describe how it is impressive, brilliant. Almost everyone compares the movie with other mockumentaries which is unnecessary, if you ask me. By this style, the movie does not become an imitation or pretentious, it makes it real effective. Then, why realism does not effect people? It seems that the haters do not care about whether it is extremely realistic or not. I put myself in the characters's place, panicked as if I am in there and I worried about each of them. By the way, there is an action scene which the forces clash with the monster and it was much more satisfying than even the whole War of the Worlds!! The subway scenes are one of the best parts of the movie, also one of the most realistic parts of the movie, it was like it could happen and also so sad. The movie, Gwoemul was very appreciated, people say that it was dramatic that generally other monster movies are lack of, believe me, it is nothing. And the final. Very exciting and at the same time dramatic. However not for everyone, especially if you don't like unconventional finals. Lastly, this is one of the most engaging movies ever.",10,6,12,9 January 2010
The Hateful Eight," Has justice been done?
","Hateful Eight is less cheesy than 'Django', but the movie has problems of its own. This time, Tarantino gives us a more solid Western but also, gives us a little nasty work (no pun indeed) For the first time, in a Tarantino movie, I found some dialogs very unnecessary and uninteresting especially in the first two acts. Conversations in Pulp Fiction, Basterds and even Death Proof were brilliant, moving and smart. To watch Kurt Russell years later as the main hero (or at least one of them) was pure joy, a nostalgia, especially for 90s kids, but since his character is not deep or dominant caused by Tarantino's lazy script, his effect on the screen doesn't continue long. The character cannot be an unforgettable character like some other Tarantino characters. Michael Madsen by his offbeat character, was entertaining, but a bad-ass character would fit him much better. Just to throw us a curve, Tarantino wastes him. The character's low key manners don't make the movie brilliant or something. Then another plot twist in the flashback sequence, then another plot twist etc. all those u- turns don't give you goosebumps. The star of the movie is Leigh like Waltz in 'Basterds'. It was not acting, something else. It was just crazy and it may get Merly Streep roll in her bed! Tim Roth is the movie's Christopher Waltz in 'Django'. As for Samuel L. Jackson, anything to say? He is extraordinary! Leigh and Jackson steal the show whenever they have that chance! Zoe Bell was disappointing in her role. I am terribly sorry. Channing Tatum was good and solid, but he needed more adequate screen time. The flashback sequence is terrifying, it reminds you Kill Bill, but the tone of this sequence doesn't have an integrity with the other chapters. It sounds like a short film itself. A really impressive and shocking short film, but inside the movie, it was little odd. By the way, some cruel and vicious acts of some characters have a difficulty in giving us a 'hateful' effect against them because of their portrayal in the previous chapters. My 'hero' of the movie was Daisy and I can understand 'this film has some misogynist' criticisms, not because of those punches, but because of that disgusting final who may give you vomiting! In the movie ' Inglourious Basterds', we love Shosanna and then we hate Shosanna and then again we love Shosanna, but later we hate Shosanna. It is like Mr. Tarantino has a confusion about some of his characters written by him. In 'Hateful Eight', for example, there is a character that ninety nine percent of the people would hate or there is another character with some repulsive actions, but later, they become hero. Sorry, but what? In contrast with the hype, 'Hateful Eight' is not a bloodbath like 'Django' or 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' It is not an action movie also. Don't expect gunfights like 'Unforgiven' or like some other Western classics. The cowboys in this movie use their brains rather than their guns, but it is not like a smart chess game between cowboys. Also, slow-mo effects lessen the effect of some action moments. The character Warren played by hilarious Jackson loses his charm after his confessions. As said before, Russell is just great, but his potential was wasted after a while, because of some plot twists. Finally, in the final moments, I don't believe that there is anything for catharsis or anything that would make you cheered up. After the end credits, I asked myself, has justice been done?",6,1,5,12 February 2016
Pan's Labyrinth," I don't believe the people who criticize this movie without any rational reason!
","In the forum of the movie, there is considerable amount of threads that say very hard things about the movie, in user reviews section, most of the reviews which appreciate the movie have been found not useful and again there are a considerable amount of people who think that it is very overrated. However, why? The direction is so subtle and flawless, the cinematography is great like The Pianist meets Tim Burton movies, the story is very engaging, interesting, the creatures are so creative (like some other Del Toro movies, for example, the creature whose eyes are above his hands), the content is brilliant, it blends realistic war dramas with fairy tales (fantasy cinema), technically it looks perfect, it has some real shocking moments and a great final waits for us! It is not my personal opinion exactly, all these things are obvious (I don't want to say fact, because it would be too definite) Then why those people hate and say very bad things about it? Do they have a reasonable, acceptable reason? It seems they have not, but the question is I don't know why they do that? Just trolling? I don't say that I am one hundred percent objective, but the movie delivers on cinematography, direction, content, messages and technically. Then, what is the problem or problems of the movie? Because of this incomprehensible hate, those people say ridiculous things like the leading actress was ugly or the movie is a propaganda. Well, this will be personal, but the girl was beautiful and so likable (I wished to enter the screen and help the girl!) and the movie was not a propaganda, instead it was a criticism of fascism !!! Pan's Labyrinth is the movie that turned Del Toro into a master director and it seems that he will never reach that success again, because it was that great, he made one of the best movies of all time! And personally, it is in my top 25 (of all time) The world that Ofelia is gotten within is so interesting and the most important appealing and it is much better than Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (sorry Burton) Pan's Labyrinth's fantasy world is not so colorful, not as colorful as Tim Burton's movies, but not as a flaw. The first violent attempt was real shocking, it is seriously disturbing, but since it does not serve our entertainment (it serves the criticism), it is positively effective. The movie is also enjoyable, even if not throughout, for example the toad scene was amusing. As for the messages of the movie, to neglect in wife, baby discrimination (hate for female babies), fascism etc. etc. How many movies put all these things together and even perfectly? None !!! The knife scene, the most shocking violent moment of the movie and recalled me of course Joker, was one of the unforgettable moments of the movie (and may be in the cinema history!) And the following scene in front of the mirror was also a subtle, impressive directing success! And in the final, there is a moment which extremely thoughtful and open to discuss. A note: it couldn't have been implied better. The movie ends in a not cliché way (you are my man Del Toro!) This is an original, uncommon ending, not a cliché and audience-driven one that generally blockbusters use.",10,3,11,7 August 2010
Barry Lyndon," With my kindest regards
","Barry Lyndon is one of the greatest films of all time to me and sometimes it makes me think that is it the greatest movie ever made? When the film ended, I was so upset, I never had felt like that in another movie as I remember. It is not surprising that for some people, it is extremely dull and too long. Yes, it is not for the people who prefer fast paced movies or movies with fast editing. This is the fact that unconventional films are not appreciated mostly. As known, Kubrick was a perfectionist director, so he made perfect films, but Barry Lyndon is the best Kubrick movie to me. Honestly, I seriously got bored while watching The Killer's Kiss that is only 67 minutes! but did not get bored while watching Barry Lyndon even one second. When I saw the lettering ''Intermission'', I felt like no need for a break. The film is probably the most still, flowing, beautiful, artistic, reposeful and kindest film ever made and it is pure cinema. The way of story telling is very elegant, kind in every scene. The background music and narration make the movie much more mesmerizing. The coherence among the music, the narration and the content is great. And I want to say that the most magical narration is here The duel scene between Barry Lyndon and his stepson. Probably the longest duel in the history of cinema. This scene is my favorite scene of the movie, I would put it in the cinema anthology. I have never seen such a duel in my life. The foxy music warns us, something sad will happen. Tension gets higher, higher and higher. It is a mix of perfectionism, quintessential cinema and art. Barry Lyndon is not a good person as he is not evil. He entices Lady London, it is a liaison. Besides, later he makes something deadly. Although, he is guilty, he gets angry when Lady London's husband lectures him and so on. I try to mean that Barry Lyndon is a deep character study. As for its rating (once upon a time, one day it was in the list, the other day it was not.) it is a huge question mark.",10,2,4,24 December 2009
Captain America: The First Avenger," Outstanding production, average movie
","As I see, people like Joe Johnston, believe in him, it seems that Marvel and the producers believed in him too, but why they didn't choose a more successful or a master director for the project? And another question, why they didn't think much about the actor who would play Captain America? I am not sure about the director, but I have had a name in my mind from the beginning and he is Chris Pine! What a coincidence that both of the actors' name is Chris. At this point, I have to say that I like Chris Evans and hearing some news about his reactions towards the negative criticisms saddened me and I know that we, you, whatever, like him too. And I have to say another thing, as you know, Chris Evans played another super hero before in Fantastic Four, Johnny Storm which creates another problem itself, because simply it is a bad idea, but what I am going to say at this point is that he was great as Johnny Storm, the chemistry between Evans and his character was flawless. In Captain America, I couldn't buy him as Captain America and believe me it was a really bad thing! As for direction, the production quality, technical quality, art direction etc. are outstanding and if you say if an entertainment movie is really entertaining, that's enough, that's OK, but don't expect a Byran Singer, Tim Burton or Ang Lee. And the negative hype about the action is partly true. I couldn't see any great action scene here. The action is satisfying, yet standard. It doesn't leave an impression on you. As for the problem with the script, this is may be the biggest problem of the movie, the movie has a very long introduction which is good, but a short and fast development and conclusion. This has a negative effect on action either unfortunately, because you know, if you focus on the origin story too much, then you can't find a lot of time for action and adventure or Captain's powers. Tommy Lee Jones just shines in the movie and with cliché terms, he steals the show in the scenes he appears. There is not any problem with Hugo Weaving and his villain too. May be the only problem is that we can't learn much information about his background story, but it is fine. One of the good sides of the movie, at least for me is that the movie is not a propaganda movie (there is a big difference between heroism/patriotism and propaganda) or it does not try to give the audience some political messages and it is not a populist movie like 'Battle Los Angeles' for example, I loved this, I appreciated (I don't know is it important for anybody but) As for some details, I know, they had tried to make the costume realistic and they did, which is not a bad thing, but as a person who seriously gives importance to costumes and appearances, I didn't like Captain America's costume very much. Yes, I don't hate campy or kitsch super hero costumes. In conclusion, the adaptation might meet the original work in terms of production and entertainment, but not in terms of spirit.",4,0,4,2 September 2011
Fargo," The problem is the sayings
","Fargo is a movie that has an interesting story, it is a good movie, but also well directed with a snowy cinematography. There are outstanding actors such as Wlliam H. Macy, Peter Stormare, Steve Buscemi. There is also Frances Mc Dormand, another outstanding actress, even if she is so unsympathetic in this movie, she is usually cold anyway, but. If Fargo had been made after A Simple Plan, I would have said cliché or an imitation, but I can say that it was a pioneer. This is a crime movie, a bag full of money, two killers, a female cop and misfortunes. As said, a good movie, but no more than that. This is the problem. It is seen as one of the best movies of 1990s, some say it is the best Coen Brothers movie by far! Almost every Coen movie is compared with Fargo, so found disappointing, critics say that it was a masterpiece. This is the problem. The movie is good, but there is nothing that great in the movie. By the way, Fargo is not flawed, but I did not like the end. It was raw and too simple for such a movie. Honestly, I liked A Simple Plan more, even if it was inspired by Fargo and made later. Because it was stunning, but Fargo is not. At least it should not have been in IMDb Top 250.",6,2,4,11 January 2010
Watchmen," After a second view, it just grows on you
","Watchmen has some fresh material that no comic book adaptation dared, so a kind of revolution, but there are some problems in it that make the movie a hard and less entertaining experience. In other words, it is related to you. It is like if your viewpoint about cinema, comic books or super heroes is the same with Alan Moore, Watchmen will be your movie, but if you are interested in rather cinema, entertainment, then it will turn into a hard experience. Mostly, the development of the events makes the movie less engaging, gripping and less entertaining. Visually, Watchmen is very well, dark, but at the same time colorful, some images are dazzling, the plot is astonishing, because inventive and smart, but somehow, there is lack of impressive material (except for Rorschach?) I don't know why, but Watchmen recalls me Sin City, another revolution in cinema. I have not read the comic book of Watchmen yet, but as the people said, the movie is very loyal to the comic book, even some of them say the most loyal adaptation so far. As for the innovations, in Watchmen, super heroes are not as pure as snow, especially The Comedian and Dr. Manhattan. One kills or hurts innocent people and enjoy doing that, the other does not care about humanity and he kills innocent people either. This is also the first movie which we see toys of some super heroes which is good. The movie has some social and political subtexts, it has some great one- liners... A corrupt and decayed world, life and death, a little philosophy, Watchmen has all those and more, but somehow it leaves a 'funny' taste in your mouth. It seems that some critics and the people who are like Alan Moore don't complain about lack of action or lack of tension or slight entertainment etc. but the poster, the characters, the story prepare you for action and excitement, but the comic book is not about that, so by the loyalty of Snyder, we see a different movie than we had expected. By the way, the movie has some action, don't get me wrong. However, also there are some bizarre and raw violent scenes which I have no idea about. Good news for the people who like such kind of stuff, but that scene which they fight a group of gang was too much! Very luckily, there are not many slow motion shots in Watchmen in comparison with 300, Snyder uses the camera greatly here. By the way, I did not complain about the sex scene at all, unbelievably, many people talk about this and say it was awful, bizarre. It was just a scene, not good, not bad, if you ask me. Yes, as some people think too, the character who 'shoulders' the movie was Rorschach, he has become my favorite character from the movie. A sort of, he recalls Sin City's Marv also. His adventures, his 'face', a very interesting character from the world of Watchmen. The other characters, especially Dr. Manhattan are interesting too, but Rorschsach was like the only character gets the movie move. However, these are not the things that the fans of the comic book want to discuss (remember, it changes according to what you are interested in) The parts he appears are the most appealing parts of the movie. There are some further problems either. Patrick Wilson is one of the most weird choices for that character or why they used plastic make up for Nixon? I haven't seen, but Frank Langella would be very good. The parts that take place in the huge station/base were uninspiring and a bit cliché and also recently we saw a similar one in Hellboy II. Despite all these things, I appreciate Snyder, because he is an auteur, he has his own style, he is not one of those 'incumbent directors'.",9,2,4,15 February 2010
The Bourne Identity," A run of the mill and forgettable action thriller
","For the first time, I watched Bourne Identity years years ago, it was just another action thriller like watch and be entertained. To me it is so weird and sad that the rating of Identity (7.7) is higher than the rating of Supremacy which is unusual and astonishing with amazing action scenes. Bourne Identity is a well made and engrossing action thriller, but ordinary and forgettable. The only success of the movie is that despite the story is cliché (a spy who loses his memory tries to remember his past and identity while struggling with other spies who try to kill him), the movie does not make you feel this. The relationship between him and the girl seems cliché (always our hero finds a girl or a girl finds him), but in my opinion, it was realistic, so no problem wih it. In terms of action, the movie is not slow paced, but there are two three action scenes including a well (but not cool or fresh) car chase that's why it is forgettable. Therefore, if you want an engrossing thriller, you are not disappointed, but if you expect a solid action movie, or lots of action, it becomes a big disappointment. The most and may be only astonishing thing was Clive Owen (so his character) to me. He adds zest to the movie. And there is one thing at the final part that I haven't forgotten since that year. It was a brilliant action moment which we had not seen a similar one before.",6,1,4,24 January 2010
The Italian Job," Talking, talking and talking
","I don't call it fun, because the movie was too slow paced. It begins good, the opening scene arouses attention, but then talking, talking and talking. It is weird, isn't it? Many people say it is fun, fun and fun and also fast paced. May be, they forget Die Hards, Mission Impossibles etc. at that moment. I believe that comparing original movies and remakes are a bit wrong, so I won't do that, but I want to say that as a note, the original film was excellent and real fun from the beginning till the end. In addition, it was very flowing, because it did not consist of talking like this movie. And its great (and unusual) final had the last word. This remake is not even an action movie, because there is no action except the expected car chase scene which takes place very late. Then, the movie livens up a bit, but that's all. Edward Norton is interesting, there is Jason Statham who is the man of action movies and more, but none of them can save the movie, because as mentioned, not only it is slow paced, but also it is not a stylish picture, just OK in terms of direction. Such movies sell themselves as action movies, thrill rides, but they are not. If you call a scene that they drive a car for test before the heist as action, then it changes. The chase scene was fun, but there are much better car chases, it does not raise the bar. Just a fun car chase, but before, you have to watch the uninteresting conversations between Wahlberg and Theron to see this chase. By the way, they get closer of course later. A soap bubble movie.",1,1,6,19 December 2009
Baby Driver," Enjoyable, full of nice songs, but in the second half, the movie loses its authenticity
","I like and follow Mr. Wright as an original and creative director and in my opinion, 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' is his masterpiece. Hot Fuzz was flawed, but it was a fun and thrill ride and I enjoyed it. Shaun of the Dead was brilliant and funny, but The Baby Driver doesn't feel like it was made by Edgar Wright. This is not his style as a filmmaker. The first half is very entertaining and very colorful like a candy, the camera work, music, characters are all great. However, in the second half, the movie turns into an ordinary crime/heist movie like any other director can shoot. The movie pays homage to some cult movies such as The Terminator, Bonnie and Clyde etc. but it loses its charm and becomes predictable with a boring, weird and unnecessary climax. This movie is supposed to be about music, old tracks and car chases, but other than songs, actually it is not! Don't expect impressive and long car chases like Bullitt or Gone in 60 Seconds etc. If you think that this movie is a car-driven film, you get seriously disappointed. Kevin Spacey is fun here, but the character's changeable motivations kill the rationality here. Jamie Foxx is the star of the movie and also he was my favorite character in the movie. The other couple was very repulsive for me, but the actors plays in a very passionate way, but I didn't care their survival. Music is great here like The first Guardians of the Galaxy and especially the first half was a great piece of entertainment, but the movie has so many flaws. The chemistry and love story between two main characters feels superficial and unrealistic. It is just a plot device. In the final chapter, the movie is a real letdown because of some bad plot twists. I recommend this movie for entertainment, but also if you have zero expectation.",5,3,6,26 August 2017
Justice League," A Complete Disaster
","Where do I start? They showed and revealed too much in the trailers first, it was a mistake, big mistake! While watching the movie yesterday, it felt like 'I saw this before, also saw this, also saw that! Over advertising and introduction especially at movie theaters have sicken us. We have lost our desire to be excited. I always say trailers from 90s and 80s must be a lesson for producers and filmmakers in the industry. They have been in a rush to putting this 'team' together, making this movie as soon as possible! Well, the result is pathetic. People in these days don't try to make a great movie, instead to make a great amount of profit. That's the problem. CGI in this movie is very cheesy like I couldn't believe my eyes. Especially the scenes with Steppenwolf are like a video game in medium quality. Henry Cavill's upper lip 'touch' needs no comment. Batman/Bruce Wayne suffers from a character shift from 'BvS: Dawn of Justice'. He is a totally different man here and I have no idea they did it intentionally or unintentionally! He is not serious, not powerful, not intimidating and definitely not a leader in this movie. Flash is fun, but not the version that the character deserves. His jokes are mostly forced and pretentious. The catastrophic events are not handled well, there is a family who serves almost no purpose etc. Aquaman was very intimidating and cool in the trailers, but in the movie, it is meh! After a while, the character loses his charm, from the top, he goes down like Batman. I like and the most importantly were satisfied with Cyborg. He was the only character with Wonder Woman who gave me reason during the movie to enjoy the picture. The villain of the movie, Steppenwolf with a very poor CGI is no much different than that bland villain Ares of Wonder Woman which is a decent movie by the way. Wonder Woman is the star of this movie. She steals the show and it is wonderful, but the entrance of the character was more like a parody itself. Mostly, character motivations are missing and character development is poor. As for Superman, it was one of the biggest screen disappointments I have ever had in my life! No heart, no soul and it makes 'Man of Steel' a masterful work of art or a great masterpiece! They cannot feel us the consequences of a world without Superman. Even Superman Returns was very good at discussing these issues. Batman and Superman here are like the parodies of their actual characters. What does Superman do in this movie? This means the comeback story isn't handled well. Is there any iconic moment which will give you goosebumps? Well, go and see it for yourself. We cannot feel his real power potential in this saving world adventure. Justice League is a two-hour popcorn entertainment with almost zero background, if you say that's enough for me, then there is nothing to discuss about. For example, the great Commissioner Gordon is just there.. We don't meet him yet. We don't know him yet. Humor is very forced at times. Action scenes are boring and we already saw most of them in the trailers which is a pity for us. I have no interest for Lois Lane anymore. I prefer to look at a picture of Margot Kidder on a wall for hours rather than watching the relationship between Lois Lane and Superman in these movies. The slow motion moments of Flash feels amateurish and it doesn't create any spark, thrill or even fun during the action. By the way, I am still not sure about whether this nerdy version of Flash is hilarious or pathetic? Finally, the second after the credits scene is better than the whole movie itself.",1,1,3,4 December 2017
Man of Steel," It is rather self destruction
","Zack Snyder's Superman interpretation 'Man of Steel' had a big promise in the trailers, but as a movie, it is a pretty soulless, CGI based and shallow adaptation. The odd first part seems pretty familiar for us: a CGI feast planet in a bad way like any other science fiction movie. The atmosphere really doesn't fit the soul of Superman and with all those dragons and spaceships, it doesn't feel like Superman. I liked Jor El, not because I liked the character, it was because I love Russell Crowe! Otherwise, the character was not believable or captivating. Henry Cavill is perfect as Superman and Clark Kent both. Probably, even Christopher Reeve must be happy in his grave. It is just an example of perfect cast choice in the history of filmmaking. A pretty realistic and little depressing version of the character. Kevin Costner plays his part very well, he was cool, so does Diane Lane, but an attitude of the character in the middle of the movie is pure nonsense and it seems like an unreasonable plot device. As for Lois Lane and Amy Adams, I just want to point out that Lois Lane character shouldn't be a strong or dominant woman like this or boring like Kate Bosworth's interpretation in 'Superman Returns'. She should be like Margot Kidder. Michael Shannon is no disappointment as an intimidating villain also with his powerful acting. CGI in this movie ruins your experience like 'I am Legend' did. I have no idea what kind of technology they used in the film, but it looks cheesy and superficial. Some fights remind me Thor's fight in the town in a bad way. The villain's cliché evil plans for the world and humanity is a CGI victory, but who cares? The final battle which ends ridiculously is like an endless destruction that leaves you dazed. The movie has some great visuals, on the other hand very cheesy and superficial visual effects, but this is not a sophisticated, dark or fascinating film like 'Watchmen'. The action was solid, but not brilliant or stunning. It is true that Zack Snyder is a good visual myth teller or a magical technician, but what is missing in his movies is little heart and excitement.",5,1,3,5 April 2016
The Revenant," Not pretentious, not boring, not overlong, not lack of substance
","The Revenant is an example of real cinema. It is not a pretentious, pseudo intellectual and pseudo artistic work, it is not a brainless blockbuster, it is not an example of 'style over substance' film as it is not a story or dialog oriented bore-fest. Some people say that it was overlong. Why does everyone need short films nowadays? Because, they want to consume a movie as soon as possible, then go back their home or text messages by their precious cell phones? Another complaint for the movie is lack of story and depth. I have to disagree. The story in the film is not sophisticated maybe and maybe it is a conventional one for such an unconventional film (not a typical example of mainstream cinema though) However, this doesn't mean that the movie is shallow or it has nothing to say to the audience. There is no real character depth in the film, but do we really need 'Shakespearean' characters for this film? This is not 'Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf?' As for realism of the movie, of course there are some parts that require suspension of disbelief, but it does not ruin your experience. As for the bear scene, I didn't see anything like this before. Period. The movie could have been boring if Inarritu would have tried to tell us the love story between our survivor and his wife, because then the movie would be another Pocahontas tale or a very similar film with Terrence Malick's 'The New World.' Also The Revenant is not this year's Dances with Wolves or something. If we don't consider 'Man in Wilderness', this is a totally unique and distinctive film. Honestly, I hated 'Birdman', because it was pretentious and no heart and soul in the delivery. The Revenant is natural and emotional, yet not overly sentimental or heartwarming. I don't enjoy 'cold' movies personally, but The Revenant is not such a movie. You feel the film. You feel the scenery. You feel the situation of the characters. However, the most important, you feel the film. Birdman? It is hard to say. Leonardo Di Caprio delivers very well, even if still his greatest performance is in 'What's eating Gilbert Grape?' Nobody, but nobody can be better than Leo in that film in cinema history! Leo deserves the Oscar this time maybe (also he should have won in 'The Departed') but honestly, if there is someone better than him in the movie, he is Tom Hardy! He does it again. One more time, he proves that he is one of the best actors in this generation and he steals every scene he is in. A trenchant, brutal and stunning performance! Leo's great performance is based on physical difficulties and emotion. Inarritu's direction is perfect here. No need to say that the scenery is beautiful, the cinematography is mesmerizing, the shots are terrific, the editing is brilliant, visual effects are superb etc. Don't expect some clichés like Di Caprio's character befriends Indians, then fight back etc. No. This is a different film. That's why it is not boring. The Revenant has a gripping story. It has a story. It has substance. Yes, maybe, in the second half, the movie loses its intensity and agonizing tone and maybe the final act is not that unusual or unforgettable or surprising, but still it delivers. The Revenant is not a thought provoking film, the revenge story is not bitter, intense or powerful like 'Unforgiven, but it has enough words to say about life and death, revenge, human nature and God. And I am very glad that the characters don't speak too much so we enjoy the great scenery.",9,1,3,7 February 2016
The Shining," One of the greatest directors, one of the greatest actors, one of the worst movies
","Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors of all time and his many movies are excellent, probably because he is perfectionist, despite this is a torture for the actors who worked with him. As I read, he had gotten Shelley Duvall act the same scene 87 times, then Duvall had a nervous breakdown. It seems impossible, but unfortunately, in spite of this effort (perfectionism) there is nothing except for Jack Nicholson. Everyone talks about the bicycle scene with amazement. Yes, it was interesting, but if we think about Kubrick's other movies, it is nothing. The script is seriously mediocre, the direction is a bit better than the script. For example, the development of the story is uninspiring. Nicholson enters the bar of the house and starts to talk to a man, but also he does not react at all as if everything is fine. What a bad idea to mention that the house is uncanny. You think to yourself like what is going on here? The idea of the man who comes a mansion with his wife and children, then he starts to go mad was not well adapted in other words. The movie is in contradiction with Kubrick's coherent direction style. The final was one of the most uninspiring finals of all times and a little bit ridiculous. The characters who sense the danger and try to help are nonsense and unnecessary. Those characters only serve to thrill us, but unnecessary. The child often looks gawkily, he gapes. Those moments are very silly and to me really annoying. The hatchet scene is the best (the only best) scene of the movie. I should count the bicycle scene, too which the child rides his bike through the corridors. Generally, in fact, always, nobody does something to the bad movies which loved and overrated, but The Shining was nominated for the worst director in Razzie awards. When I learned, you can't imagine how I cheered up.",1,58,123,10 December 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," It pushes the limits of greatness
","Probably this is the movie I enjoyed watching the most. Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of my all time favorite actors, I am a huge fan of him. It does not matter whether his acting is great or not (but in this movie, he is great I think) The Terminator 2 has humor at times, but because of that again rather critics give one star low! However, humor in the movie is not to entertain audiences. Humor in this movie results from natural situations, it seems that Cameron does not put such moments for our entertainment like the third Terminator movie. And this humor does not ruin the seriousness and the dark tone of the movie. I can't think of a Terminator movie without Schwarzenegger. I have seen Terminator Salvation and yes, there was Arnold Schwarzenegger too, but CGI! (an awful idea) Terminator Salvation was OK, but not as a Terminator movie, as a post apocalyptic science fiction action. I want to say a few things more about Schwarzenegger. He was an icon by this character. Motorcycle, leather jacket, sunglasses and pump rifle. At this point, this is the most humanist, may be the only action movie ever! One of my favorite one liners is the movie is ''he will live.'' Connor tries to teach him not to kill people. Don't get me wrong, it does not mean that I don't like other action movies which do not give such a message, but this just makes the movie greater and deeper. By the way, Terminator 2 is also the deepest action movie ever. This is one of the movies that when you replace any of the actors, pieces don't fall into place. Schwarzenegger is like he was made for Terminator (and yes Conan too), Robert Patrick was made for T-100 (he was at his best in this movie, may be not for acting, but for performance) and Edward Furlong was made for John Connor. Honestly, personally it was impossible to believe that Nick Stahl is John Connor, I watched him like another character. Furlong portrays a very realistic rover portrait. As for Linda Hamilton, she was not made for Sarah Connor, but it is a big pleasure to watch her and for her acting, real very good. Musics always make me live nostalgia, great musics. Now, let's talk about the scenes. The atari center sequence is the first beyond great sequence. This movie is great entertainment, every time, it is a great pleasure to watch it. From the middle of 1990s till now, I watched the movie almost 50 times. I love the metal holes and then renew. How creative it is. As for visual effects, it is a touchstone, yes still. It is the greatest visual effects of all time to me, till 2012. Now, to me it became the second greatest. And I am sorry, I find the visual effects of T2 much more believable than Avatar. Yes I know, 3D, some other new technologies as well. but this is what I think. At a few moments, it is flawed like the scene they shoot at the face of Schwarzenegger, but no problem at all. Can you believe that this movie was made in 1991? I can't believe at all. That's why it is still a milestone. The chase sequence in the highway is beyond great too. Cameron raised the bar and I used to compare all the chase scenes with this one. Do you know another movie that in user comments, the titles which say the greatest action movie ever are innumerable? Almost everyone says the greatest action movie ever, the best action movie of all time, the greatest, the best... I will say the same thing. This is the greatest action movie of all time. The pump rifle using style of Terminator was getting my attention when I was a child. Still I like that. I just like gunfight scenes, not guns by the way. The hospital sequence is the third beyond great sequence, there are a lot of scenes that deserves cinema anthology in this movie. The coffee scene was incredible, every time makes me remember The Silver Surfer, we get lots of very interesting and brilliant moments like the shoot at head (not just in this sequence, throughout the whole movie) The Terminator is 10 out of 10, but T2 surpasses even that (you know I can't give 11 out of 10) Ohh By the way, I don't recommend you to watch the extended edition, if you are a first time viewer. There are three new scenes in this edition. The scene which Sarah hallucinates, to me a mediocre scene, the scene which T-100 tells Sarah and John where his chip is, an unnecessary scene and the scene which a kind of foreplay and talking between Tarissa and Miles while he works at desk, a cliché and a bit ridiculous scene. Returning to the movie, this is the best cat and mouse game movie with No Country for Old Men, it wouldn't be better. T-1000 is the most powerful, the most resistant (the most indestructible) villain ever! You think that he is terminated, but he is not, will he be terminated this time? The movie delivers such a feeling that I would define great success. Helicopter truck fight is great, another action sequence, I would call the kind of action in the movie metallic, not CGI action. By the way, mercury scene was one of the most shocking moments in the cinema history! Unbelievable, incredible. There is an unaccountable moment which it seems that Hulk was inspired from. Another moment recalls The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King etc. If you watched both movies, you understand what I mean. And T-1000 continues to execute his tricks, I was bowling over every time. This is a non stop action movie, but not shallow at all, not like pure action with no substance, in contrast the deepest action movie ever made.",10,14,16,22 March 2010
Silver Linings Playbook," In spite of some minor flaws, the silver playbook shines
","When I saw the name as the director of the film, I was almost sure that this film would be an offbeat romantic comedy and I was right! However, it doesn't mean that the movie is perfect or that great. You know, David O. Russell is a story teller, not a minimalist, not a formalist, it has advantages and disadvantages both. The main advantage is that he tells his story well, but the main disadvantage is that his movies are lack of any art form. I mean watching his movies is like reading a book or listening a story, not cinematic experiences. In the end, I wasn't impressed by the film cinematically or artistically, but liked the story and loved the characters. Depending on his style, his director identity, the story of the movie seriously exhausted me which I can see as a flaw, but the story and the characters saved the film for me. I didn't expect metaphors or deep character studies from the movie, but the movie could have been deeper anyway. This is a sincere film first, it doesn't play to the crowd, but as I know, it has been criticized as it is a formulaic film. Well Yes and No at the same time. The problems, but all of those were minor, of the movie for me are for example the movie was not devastating or intense enough. Yes, this is a romantic comedy, but I would have preferred a The Fighter-like film. At least darker than this film. In other words, this might have been a really depressing film, but it is not. This movie reflects some habits of the director too, for example there is a 'merry' family similar with the family in The Fighter etc. As for De Niro, with all my regard, I believe that the actors who were the golden actors or legends of their ages don't play that great when they are old (most of them) Chris Tucker who gave a mind bending performance in The Fifth Element seems out of place in this movie, but the actor adds energy into the movie. Bradley Cooper is pretty good, but sorry not great. As for Lawrance, my first Jennifer Lawrance movie was X-Men First Class and I couldn't warm to her honestly and I thought that she was a bad Mystique in comparison with amazing Rebecca Romijn, but in this movie, I almost fell in love with her and even her crazy character. I loved her character too I confess. She shines, she steals the show from everybody! By the way, a beautiful little detail I caught in the movie was the movie hadn't evil ex wife cliché, it was different (see it and decide for yourself) The dance competition stuff may be makes the movie cliché and conventional, but also sweet and realistic. By the way, it reminded me Little Miss Sunshine. However, the motivations of the characters, their inner worlds aren't handled well, insufficient and a little shallow. We understand them, but we can't enter their inner worlds. The movie has not any problem about emotional involvement, but, not deep enough. I can't feel that these two people are desperate losers or stand for any kind of character in real life. And we witness their life with independent sections, so we cannot internalize the film totally, but all these doesn't affect the whole film much. By the way, it would have been much better, if the film had ended a few minutes earlier. Silver Linings Playbook is still a very good movie for what it is.",8,1,3,9 May 2013
Spider-Man," Great entertainment, but a very scratchy adaptation
","I watched the movie many times, it is one of the most enjoyable movies, but in comparison with the comic book or the animation series (to me one of the bests of all time), it was very disappointing, because no expectation is met here. Raimi (and also Tobey Maguire himself) has made us believe that Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker/Spider-Man, despite the original character is much more stalwart and he is not that loser as Peter Parker in this adaptation. What kind of person Peter Parker is? The movie becomes scratchy while asking this question, in other words, the introduction of one of the best Super heroes is unsatisfying. In addition, may be the most important part of the movie, the part which the spider bites Parker and the metamorphosis process were great fun, but something is missing. Can it be a careful direction and a brilliant script? The bite scene take place too early, it is also an ordinary scene from the movie. Spider-Man flies throughout the city, those images are dazzling, then he rests the Gargoyles statue, sometimes he talks with it which is humor. In the movie all these details and more are ignored. The tone and the atmosphere of the movie are very different, so I felt out of things. By the way, the fight in the school, the zooms before that look amateurish. As I know, some people criticize the film so that it is like a teenager movie, in my opinion, it is not, but it has different problems. In some scenes, very bad CGI is an eyesore. I just did not like the wrestling scenes, it is because of Raimi again, the Wolverine fight in X-Men, for example was much more better, excellent. J. Jonah Jameson character is cartoonish, especially in the second movie, he was superficial, but some people think that he is as good and funny as the original character. The action scene with balloons (recalls Batman) is the best action scene of the movie and great fun, too and there is a weird image that Parker imitates Superman! Lastly, the humor conception, many enemies versus Spider-Man fantasy, character development, story editing, lack of detail etc. are problematic. Spider-Man often puts his camera somewhere in the crime scene in order to take money from J. Jonah Jameson. Sometimes, the camera crumbles, but sometimes he succeeds in delivering the photos. Or Spider-Man is a chatterbox, he often talks with himself while flying or fighting his enemies. Sometimes, he makes jokes about the situation he is in etc. None of them is here! Spider-Man is a feel yourself good movie and one of the most entertaining movies, but fails as a Spider Man movie.",5,0,1,3 January 2010
X-Men: Days of Future Past," It is not quite smart, sophisticated or even epic as the hype, just a piece of entertainment and technically well made sequel
","'Days of Future Past is not your brainless blockbuster film, it is moving, entertaining and classy, but the main focus of the story, time travel adventure is not intriguing or that sophisticated or mind blowing. It was plain and simple working as a plot device, so this X- Men movie is not 'The Butterfly Effect' or 'Donnie Darko' of X-Men movies. By the way, in social media, this film is compared to 'The Usual Suspects' and it is said that 'Days of Future Past is as brilliant as that. I have to disagree. Briefly, there is an event which shouldn't happen and our team tries to stop it before happening, but there is no really a puzzle to solve. Personally, my favorite X-Men film is the first one, it has a special place in my heart. X-2 was great and the most powerful film in the series maybe. As for The Last Stand, I am terribly sorry, but I liked and enjoyed that movie very much. The third movie had the best action and the most 'close to comic book' tone. It was not cheesy like some other super hero movies and some deaths might be frustrating for many fans, but it was realistic and dark. The second serious problem of 'Days of Future Past' is that the future depiction in the film was pretty disappointing like a sci-fi movie made for cable TV and the designs lacked creativity. It was like I was watching Mortal Kombat 2. By the way, I would have wanted to see Storm and old Magneto more. Those characters have very short appearances. Briefly, the future scenes were poor somehow. At the beginnings, the movie has a light tone, but it gets darker after a while which is good. The characters? Well, The Beast is more intense here, Fassbender steals the show and as for Jennifer Lawrance and her Mystique, she is gorgeous, she has a charming beauty and as a character, she delivers, but I still looked for Rebecca Romijn for some reason. Toad is passive here. Sentinels are impressive, but I had problem with their size. The famous Quicksilver scene is brilliant, the best scene of the movie, but it was like a copy of Nightcrawler scene in X-2. The action in the film is neither over the top nor bad. Days of Future Past is not an action packed like the third or the first film, but the action was solid. I disagree that drama and action is perfectly balanced in the film. The stadium scene is another must see part of the film. Finally, like The First Class, the tone of the movie is more realistic rather than fantastic, by the way The First Class is a way better film than DOFP. 'Days of Future Past' is not a masterpiece or even great, but a pretty solid film.",6,1,2,9 April 2016
Captain America: Civil War," It could have been better, but still a well executed Marvel film
","'CA: Civil War' is an important step in super hero movies, because as known, it deals with some moral themes, asking some moral questions, it focuses on the destruction and mayhem in the cities by heroes. Therefore, it is an emotional movie also which is nice. Despite the movie is called 'civil war', this is not exactly a war, a mini battle between the allies. This feels like an epic film, but unfortunately it is not. The best action part of the film comes at this point: the famous airport scene! It could have been much better, but still great! Recently, some super hero movies have started to inspire from 'Empire Strikes Back' and this movie is one of them. It tries to be dark and epic like 'ESB'. Crossbones was a disappointment as a cameo, the other villain is pretty interesting though. The opening sequence of the movie which recalls 'Expendables' movies are fun, but no more than that. The meetings among the heroes to discuss the subjects are key points of the film and very interesting to listen, but it could have been deeper, darker and longer. There is a few moments of an avenger in the middle of the movie and it is pretty touching indeed, Russo Brothers can touch your heart which is a plus, but again, the movie could have been much more touching and also intense. Black Panther is perfect! He is the star of the movie like Bucky in 'The Winter Soldier.' The chase scene is one of the bests in Marvel history. The shoots are jaw dropping! The battle between Cap and Stark which is the main focus of the story is fairly done and technically masterful, but it feels rushed. It is not brilliant or unforgettable, but touching and impressive! Iron Man is not too powerful in this movie which is an improvement (realistic) By the way, I was very impressed by the strong friendship between Steve and Bucky. 'Civil War' is not epic or action packed, but it is very good. Spider- Man here is hilarious here and it is not a disappointment. I just didn't like his new 'camera' eyes. Also, I don't like these frequent casting changes, but every new change means a new chance. As for Aunt May, a bold choice, but it was OK. All the other heroes do their part without question. For War Machine, I prefer Terrence Howard, but Cheadle is OK, too. Black Panther is cool, but too assertive and too self confident, but the character was extremely impressive. 'Captain America: Civil War' is a very good and strong super hero movie, but it could have been better. I prefer 'The Winter Soldier' over 'Civil War.'",8,2,8,24 July 2016
Resident Evil," This was what I wanted
","Resident Evil is not the best zombie movie, but the best action based on zombies, the battle between humans and zombies. The movie focuses on this battle as it should be, there are not trashy sub stories or there are not dull characters. There is not a cliché scientist who responsible for all the stuff. By the way, the movie is stylish and well executed that the sequels don't have. Also, the whole film is entertaining. Resident Evil is a consistent movie on all counts, direction, script... The mise-en-scene, especially the set designs, camera angles and atmosphere recall computer games. Besides, the laser scene is very high adrenalin and to me one of the most unforgettable scenes, not only of the movie, but also in action cinema. The first battle between Alice, the team and the zombies are my favorite, also a great demo scene. It is very long and satisfying. The make up effects are not flawless, but very impressive, not like the second and third movies (they were flimsy) There could have been more clash with the zombies, but as said, in terms of action and a Resident Evil adaptation, it is satisfying. The dog scenes are interesting, even if a bit funny (karate against animals?) The other Resident Evil movies copied it by the way, because it is really creative. The train scene is also pretty good. As said, mostly, those kind of movies start well, some of them develop well, too, but at the end, something ruins everything. Thus, Resident Evil is an exception. Lastly, yes, as many people think, the closing was one of the best closing scenes ever seen.",8,3,4,31 January 2010
No Country for Old Men," I don't exchange it for 1000 Fargo
","There a lot of people who hate the movie, not just disliked, they hate! Look at reviews or visit the forums, you will see. Art house movies are unconventional generally, but for No Country for Old Men is not an art house film, but it is not a blockbuster too. It is both, I mean artistic and at the same time entertaining. I know that the people who hate it would not call it entertainment, because they were not entertained. Then, why haters hate this movie? Because it is not a crowd pleaser? Well, firstly, they say that the movie was very dull, very very slow paced. If you ask me, the time flies by, I did not get bored at all. I was hypnotized, mesmerized. By the way, do you know what is one of the most frustrating things about this movie for me? Some people say this is inferior in comparison with Fargo or Blood Simple. I watched both movies and I am really sorry, but I enjoyed both movies, both are must- see experiences, but they are, Fargo, Blood Simple were just good movies to me, no more than that. A critics says that cinema feeling in There will be Blood was more strong than No Country for Old Men. How funny, I liked There will be Blood very much, but think just the opposite. The cinema of Old Men is more powerful than There will be Blood. Old Men is pure cinema. Another critic says that I would not call the movie masterpiece, because ultimately, a man pursues another man, this is the story. Well, this was what I wanted anyway, but also this is just the surface. The directors don't use background music (unconventional), I loved that, but this is the second complaint as I see. It makes the movie dull according to the haters. It causes me hypnotized. Many people like noisy, fast movies, this is the fact, isn't it? but why? Was Casablanca noisy or fast? No. Then, is it a movie to be hated? As for Javier Bardem, his performance, acting is appreciated even by the haters, otherwise I would kill myself anyway. Joking aside, you will think that I exaggerate, but no, to me, his performance, acting is one of the best ones of all time and his character is one of the best villains so far too. What Day Lewis is in There will be Blood, Bardem is in No Country for Old Men. A superhuman performance. Just by one scene, it can be understood. In one of the most disturbing scenes, even if off screen, I mean his last visit, after that, in the car, look at his face! It tells a lot of things. The opening scene of the movie is one of the greatest opening scenes ever made! In terms of content, it is horrible, in terms of cinema, it is great. In this scene, Bardem is at one of the zeniths of his performance by the way. To watch this character, Anton Chigurh was very entertaining, very interesting, sometimes funny and sometimes evil, horrible. One of the reasons that I love the movie is this, I mean, The Brothers created a great character, to be more precise, they adapted the character in a perfectionist way from the novel. As for Chigurh's weapons, forbidding, horrible, weird, but also inventive. I knew Josh Brolin by this movie, I can't remember him in The Goonies, I watched it when I was a child but. Therefore, I liked the actor very much including his character. After that I watched him in American Gangster and he was great in that movie. In this movie, he is in Bardem's shadow, but still does a great job. He was an interesting character too. On average, how many favorite scenes you have in a movie? No Country for Old Men is an exception for me, because if I count my favorite scenes, it makes almost the whole movie. All the scenes Bardem appears are my favorites once. I will mention some of them. The scene that he tries to find the bag by the device, the scene that he carries out first aid to himself (this scene also tells somethings about the personality of the character, he is really a psychopath, he seems panicked, he cares about himself, his health very much), the scene that he makes a sudden attack to the hotel, again a horrible, but in terms of direction, a fresh, great scene. I had not been on pins and needles like that in another movie. There are several reasons for that. For example, Anton Chigurh is like T-1000 from The Terminator 2. In some moments, I said to myself that's it! or something like that in theater. Now do you understand why I love that? As for the sheriff (our bonus Tommy Lee Jones), the first sheriff character on screen who is unwilling to solve the cases, catch the bad guys (unconventional and brilliant) And, as the third complaint, a few unexpected twists that take place near the final. It might be unsatisfying, but it was realistic and shocking. Everything does not work out the way we expect it will.",10,5,8,17 February 2010
District 9," If somebody gives you a 'flower', you accept it, right?
","You know that many people hated Alien 3. Even the movies in IMDb Bottom 100 that some people are sorry for haven't been treated like that. However, my objection is that there are not really credible or really valid reasons of people. Alien 3 was entertaining, it was dark, it was suspenseful, bizarre (in a good way) harsh etc. but many people did not care about it and it is the same for District 9. The opening sequence of the movie, the introduction part in documentary style was extremely realistic, but at the same time very exhausting, I missed the half of it, it was because I watched the film with subtitles, so couldn't follow that part. The aliens in the movie are the most realistic and also intelligent ones in science fiction cinema history! The visual effects are flawless, again realistic. They look even better than the blue people of Avatar. Wikus is an unlikeable character, not a hero, not an anti hero either, he is a selfish guy, he thinks only himself, again realism here! There were some bloodcurdling, nasty details in the movie: sexual contact stuff. There is an experiment part in the movie, it is cliché, but personally I did not mind it, because the movie is dramatically very powerful, its breaking points are brilliant. If you are not against catharsis, this is your movie. In terms of action, the movie is a fresh, dynamite-like, captivating work. This movie is genius. District 9 has hundreds of themes, subtexts and metaphors. It is a satire, it is a thought provoking film. Let me tell you what I saw briefly. Basically, this movie is about humanity. Furthermore, cruel or sadistic people enjoy harming other 'people'. In the final act, there are some wow moments, I just say I was heavily impressed by the movie. May be in the final act, the movie becomes cliché, conventional a little bit, but I didn't mind. There are some real gore moments, while watching, I said to myself, these scenes must be the idea of Peter Jackson. As for the ending, it is an ending that most of the movies wouldn't dare! but the last image was too naive and unnecessary for such an intense film. Some people might find it ridiculous, but if somebody gives you a 'flower', you accept it, right?",10,2,6,6 March 2010
Batman Begins," A crowd pleaser blockbuster, despite it is a totally different Batman movie
","Yes, Batman Begins is a fundamental change in the series, so it is not like any other Batman movie, realism instead of fantasy, but as a movie, it is a conventional crowd pleaser movie, a typical blockbuster, and also there are some problems and clichés. The opening sequence of the movie is surprising, because a Batman movie does not 'begin' like that normally. We feel like we watch a drama about a man who is put in a prison. This is good, fresh, so far so good. Then, the training parts start. These parts are far from being subtle or solid. The fight on the ice was dazzling by the way. Between, we see some flashbacks, the childhood of Bruce Wayne, honestly, it was slightly disturbing to me, probably because it was a cliché trick. After that mediocre part, the first attack of the Batman was well executed, but it was not exactly entertaining because of the shaky camera and its own clichés (after the change, the hero of the movie launches an operation to the bad guys) Just a note: When I watched the movie for the first time, I had not liked the new Batmobile, it had looked me unappealing, but later changed my mind. As for the costume, the best Batman costume is in this movie! The city Nolan creates is effective, but as I know, after getting the crew watch Blade Runner, he said I want a city like that. Yes, it can be obviously seen that Nolan inspired from Blade Runner while designing the city, but sometimes, it feels like it is an imitation. My favorite sequence is the first Scarecrow and Batman encounter. And it is scary, yes I am serious. Scarecrow is a well created villain, not a missed opportunity, but the screen time of him is problematic. I watched the car chase tons of times, still I do sometimes, it is very entertaining and a great demo scene, but on the other side, a bit mediocre. And the cops who always crack jokes while in danger exist here either like The Dark Knight! As for the climactic ending, it was very ordinary, nothing special and it was showy. Therefore, this is an unusual Batman movie may be, but the movie itself is not.",5,1,2,15 February 2010
Saving Private Ryan," No ideology can resist such a piece of cinema triumph
","I visited the forums, read reviews in IMDb, read reviews of critics, talked to the people around me and as I see, people are not excited about the movie like me, it means that they don't see the greatness of the movie? or are there some other reasons? I want to give the example of The Terminator 2. If you have seen the movie, you know that, according to many people, it is the greatest action movie ever made. In IMDb, you cannot see an user easily who gives a low rating or says that it was not a very good movie. Firstly, I want to talk about that, why Saving Private Ryan is not appreciated in its genre, war like The Terminator 2? People are very cold towards this movie, as if it is just an usual but good or pretty good movie. Or they say that Omaha Beach sequence was cool (enough?) but the rest was bad. Now, at this point, I want to say that now I am writing a review on the movie which to me, one of the greatest movies of all time. This is pure cinema, maybe not a work of art, but a truly cinematic experience. Direction, the cinematography, editing, art direction, sound, sound editing and visual effects (briefly mise-en-scene) are great, the shots are great. You know, if a war movie includes action, people say that disliked it, because it was not an anti war movie and also it shows war artistic, but what if this is the style of the director? The Thin Red Line was also very artistic, but is this really a flaw? Returning to the content or the messages of the film, people say propaganda, militarist, one sided etc. As a person who got sick of hearing historically inaccurate or this movie is propaganda, I don't care about ideology while thinking about this movie. As for one sided criticism, always the same, it shows the enemy side as evil. Does somebody have to make two movies like Clint Eastwood if he makes a war movie? Well, if you ask me, No. By the way, the scene which the German soldier sings an American march is criticized, so people say Spielberg humiliates Germans. If you want to 'read' it like that, do it, but to me it was an unforgettable and tragicomic scene. The best (or the most horrible?) D-Day interpretation is here. At this point, as said before, a lot of people think that just Omaha Beach sequence was just cool. I think it is more than that. Also the structure of the movie is very different than many mainstream movies which is another success. Lastly, in the middle of the movie, there is a sequence, it rains and later they find a little girl, that sequence should be taught in cinema history lessons especially for the people who are planning to be a director.",10,3,5,13 January 2010
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Unfortunately Brad Bird can't adapt his genius vision into M:I world
","I saw the movie at IMAX theater. The technical aspect of the film was jaw dropping at times, but the movie was lack heart and soul in the delivery which was surprising, because the director Brad Bird is a genius director, he brings color to the movies. 'Mathematics' of his movies is a perfect example of film making, so I had expected something like The Incredibles meets M:I movies, but actually it was not. It was another next generation cliché formula movie which was also soulless. The only remarkable action sequence in the film was the famous Burj Khalifa part and yes it was amazing, jaw dropping, I have seen the scene numerous times and showed it to my friends with enthusiasm, but I didn't enjoy the rest of it. The climax of the film was also very formulaic and cliché. Paula Patton was extremely hot in that green dress, Simon Pegg was a joy himself, despite I am not a fan of him, Jeremy Renner was also good, Cruise was the star of the movie as usual and I just love him as an actor, but unfortunately the movie lacks any spark. As for other M:I movies, the first movie was a stylish, first class spy thriller, but I didn't adore that one either, because it was lack of real action and the plot was a little bit dull. Most people didn't like the second movie, but I loved it. Maybe, they didn't get the point. The second movie was a dream of action movie fans and it came true. It was an awesome action film in John Woo style and highly amusing, but never ridiculous! The third movie had a different style. It was fast paced, dynamic, an action and excitement packed. In spite of its little flaws, I seriously liked the third movie, too, especially because of the director's vision. A breath in fresh air... However, as the new generation superficial action movie, Ghost Protocol is my least favorite in the series. Maybe, it is a solid entertainment movie for general audience and yes most people enjoyed the film, but I just found it insipid and technique over substance. I hope Rogue Nation will be much better.",2,3,7,7 June 2015
Django Unchained," This time, Tarantino's ego is over everything
","Since Inglourious Basterds Tarantino's style has evolved and as a Tarantino fan, I am not very much glad about that. Unfortunately, Django doesn't feel like it is an old fashioned, classic Western in Tarantino style! It is rather an anti Western or a postmodern Western. I have not any problem with this directly, but for example by watching Kill Bill, you can get the taste of 80's karate or kung-fu movies, vigilante movies, by watching his friend, Robert Rodriguez's film Planet Terror, you can get the taste of horror B movies, exploitation movies etc. but you can't get the taste of spaghetti Westerns or old fashioned Westerns by watching Django unfortunately. One of the biggest problems of the movie is it doesn't take itself seriously, in other words, Tarantino doesn't take his movie seriously. The first half of the movie is pretty good, interesting, entertaining considering some little flaws, but especially the second half, the movie loses his appeal and becomes dull and even uninteresting at times. Before that, I want to mention that I couldn't buy the character Django itself. A slave who suddenly becomes a cool cowboy didn't work for me (in contrast with The Bride in Kill Bill) At the same time, I didn't think that Jamie Foxx added anything special to the character or to the film and as a cast choice, he was pretty bad. He was plain and simple without any spark like the movie itself. He couldn't an unforgettable figure in the movie and can't be even likable. Christopher Waltz was again the star of the movie, he steals the show from everybody, he was just great and he deserved that Oscar! I am sorry, but without him, the movie would have been almost unbearable for me. Di Caprio simply adds color to the movie without being a cartoonish villain. No word for Samuel L. Jackson. He is like a bulldozer in terms of acting! The movie was overly humorous at times like Basterds and I don't like that. Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and even Kill Bill were serious movies even if it has a certain amount of humor or funny moments. For example, in a scene Django wears a dress (it was blue as I remember) and as if it is made for laughs! In another scene, there is a 'mask' argument and it is like you watch a Western parody! All those harm the movie little by little. With some postmodern touches and tricks like putting modern day songs into his movie, again, Tarantino tries to be different and the most important to surprise his audiences, to amaze his audiences, but if you ask me he fails. Instead of taking old classic elements and turning those into something modern in his hands like he did in Kill Bill, in this movie, he did something different which I would define as 'anti'. Also as said, the humor harms the seriousness of his movie. In the second half, when Di Caprio gets on the stage, unfortunately, the movie doesn't get better, just the opposite, it becomes uninterested and less exciting in comparison with the long first half. When they go to Calvin Candle's place (Di Caprio), somehow the movie lost its spark and also became less entertaining. May be it is because no 'Western' anymore in the second half, instead a drama with lots of conversations and payoff! As said, Django is not a pure Western or a modernized Western, it is more like an anti Western or post modern Western. Welcome this 'a breath of fresh air' choice, but in the end, it isn't a great, brilliant or that impressive film. Also I couldn't get that cinema feeling that other Tarantino movies have in this movie, especially in the second half. The another big problem of the movie was sudden, exaggerating and out of place violence scenes. After a slow paced drama, suddenly, the movie turns into an extremely bloody action movie. The blood effects were looking like red paint or a kind of superficial liquid which killed my suspension of disbelief totally. This is exciting! but also very superficial, exaggerating and out of place! I had expected some realistic, old fashioned but Tarantino style action, but couldn't find it. There is not any built up tension, no character conflict, no suspense etc. I can't say that Django was a solid or subtle film. The story editing of the film was problematic either. The movie starts like a revenge movie, but couldn't fulfill that, then it becomes a road movie for a short time, but it couldn't fulfill that either. Then, it becomes a drama, later suddenly action and it goes on. Also, the last one or two minutes of the film seemed me uninviting or subfusc. Django Unchained is Tarantino's Machete, a disappointing and uneven experience.",4,6,8,10 May 2013
Drive," Empty, soulless and sadistic with a pseudo-artistic touch!
","I believe that the most important element in a movie first is 'having heart and soul in the delivery' in other words dramatic structure which leads to impressiveness and effectiveness both. Why the worst film I have ever seen in my life is Federico Fellini's Otto e Mezzo? or Why I hated Darren Aranofsky's The Fountain? Because there were no heart and soul in the delivery and believe me especially critics love that! Cinema without heart. Now, let's talk about Drive. What an original and 'never-seen-before' story! A hired driver who doesn't talk much decides to protect a family, a girl and her child and things in his job go awry! Other than such clichés in the plot and lacking of heart and soul, there were other flaws in the movie. Being a 'driver' or being a cool hired killer is not that easy! Ryan Gosling's wooden performance and his senseless character are just pointless and has not any interesting or deep element. The violence in the movie was neither artistic nor entertaining, it was sick and sadistic! Also it was pointless! You know Quentin Tarantino makes extremely violent movies like Kill Bill, but it is entertaining and it is artistic at the same time. Drive is not! What about music? Well, oddly, it reminded me Tron, another movie I didn't like, so simply I wasn't impressed by the songs either. Is Drive an action packed? Not at all! The movie has an exciting opening, but then it turns into an empty and dull pseudo-art work with some disgusting violence. The rest of the movie is not a piece of art or an audiovisual feast in contrast with the hype, that's why I was seriously frustrated by the movie! Unfortunately the flaws hasn't finished yet, Drive has an anti climax and pretentious finale that leaves you totally unsatisfied. I am sorry, but the ones who call this as art owe other art house directors an apology.",1,99,202,24 November 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," The best one in terms of catching the tone of the comics, unreasonable hate!
","X-Men Last Stand has too much CGI may be and it is not as powerful and brilliant as the first two, but that doesn't mean that Brett Ratner did a bad job! The Last Stand is probably one of the most enjoyable movies ever made. Honestly, the opening scene was a bit disappointing, I worried a bit (if the rest of the movie is like that) because they had tried to get Magneto and Professor X look younger by CGI. However, the movie has a second opening scene which rocks! Then, the movie has a little surprise for you, we see it for the first time, in any X-Men movie. Yes, there are some weak points in The Last Stand, but it does not deserve such a hate and low rating. The second movie was deeper, so more powerful, this third chapter is rather entertainment, pure entertainment, but I cannot see any further flaw. Instead, for example, the tone of the movie is very close to the tone of the comics and the animation which is a success. For example, while watching the scene which Cyclops goes to find Jean, it feels like I was watching the animation. Beast was a disappointment, he is too calm, too small and too thin in comparison with the original character, so he does not seem a threat to anyone. Moreover, it would have been better, if they had not gotten him wear suit. He is a doctor, not a politician. Some moments are showy that I don't like. For example, the introduction of the abilities of the new characters. However, as said, there is not any further problem in the movie. There are a lot of scenes that I watched tons of times and still do! The scene which Mystique appears first, a brilliant scene, stylish, like the first movie. The convoy scene was great, we see Magneto's power by an amazing scene. The second visit to Jean was great too. Very enjoyable and a scene that recalls the animation. And it ends by a petrifying event. By the way, there is a brilliant shot while Wolverine Juggernaut fight, I just love that. The forest scenes are also entertaining and stylish. As for the bridge scene, again amazing, but Ratner falls into the trap, he shows clichÃ© moments like the tourist who takes photos. And CGI in all those scenes are not cheesy at all. I have mentioned a lot of entertaining and amazing scenes with good CGI, but still it has not finished yet. It is weird that most audiences don't like super hero movies with a lot of action and fun. It seems like that. Because, why people love Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk but hate The Last Stand? Iron Man was entertaining, but there was much humor than action. The very long last part of X-Men 3 is amazing! This is a non stop action, fantasy movie also. In the last part, The only minor problem was that many mutants could fly which is exaggerating. I don't like Vinnie Jones, he is not appropriate for the character and the character was very different than this one (like The Beast), but the Juggernaut scene, the camera shots were amazing too. There is another surprise related to Iceman by the way, I like this character very much, even if he is a teen in contrast with the original character and the screen time of him is unsatisfying in X-Men movies. And the final parts makes you say that's it! Brett Ratner's best work!",8,3,3,7 February 2010
The Game," One of the best movies of all time in spite of some negative criticisms
","The plot of the movie is one of the most mysterious and surprising ones so far and I think about it, the recently made movies with plot twists such as The Machinist is nothing in comparison with The Game. The plot may be summarized as for his birthday gift by his brother, a businessman is engaged in an organization that arranges games in exchange for money, but soon he realizes that it is not a game. The Game is an underrated movie which in contrast, according to some audiences overrated. Besides very smart plot, the things make the movie an excellent masterpiece are Fincher's story telling, music causes mystery, atmosphere and Michael Douglas. I believe that it is an easy role may be, but Douglas seems the best choice for this role. After watching the final scene, every detail, every dialog, every event require re-interpreting. One of the best twists so far. Even just the relationship between Nicholas and Christine makes the movie enigmatic. Is Christine a femme fatale who then decides to help him? Is she a femme fatale pretends to be a good girl? or Is she a bait? Another point, Fincher reflects Van Orton's nightmarish situation perfectly also with a very stylish direction. Unbelievably, some people say that it is a plain story, the movie's theme is know the value of life. This is just an interpretation and no need to say that it is much more than that. Let's remember It's a Wonderful Life. The Game and that film are extremely different from each other, but the thing I try to say is that if we look from this point of view, the movie's theme is the same, know the value of life, in spite of the challenges, don't give up etc. but does this simple theme make the movie weak? It's a Wonderful Life is a great movie. Therefore, as said, the very consistent script, the plot, Fincher's story telling and direction, the very successful atmosphere, music and Douglas's persona make the film great and Sean Penn is our bonus. I like the final and cannot see any wrong or simple point. When I watched it first in 1997, the reaction in the final made me seriously bothered, that's why a lot of people dislike the movie, they say it ruins the movie, but I don't see it as a flaw or call it a bad ending, if you ask me, it was a bit frustrating. It is just like if I was him, I would not do what he does. The Game is one of the movies of my life.",10,0,2,25 November 2009
X-Men: Apocalypse," It is far more enjoyable than the previous one because it doesn't try to be serious and sophisticated
","'X-Men: Apocalypse' is seen as a disappointment by almost many fans after 'The Days of Future Past', but I think 'Apocalypse is a better film on many counts. 'TDOFP' didn't have comics tone, the movie took itself too seriously, the story was basic, but it tried to be sophisticated etc. 'X-Men: Apocalypse' is a fun ride, but also it has also an intelligent story. The opening scene and the villain En Sabah Nur reminds me 'The Mummy' and it was entertaining! Yes, Raven played by Lawrence has no big function in the story, she is just there, but I've started to like her character, even if I know the fact that nobody can surpass Rebecca Romijn. The parts which we visit each character with them are very interesting and enjoyable. Magneto's past being revealed was creepy and sad and masterfully done! It shows the dawn of evil inside him. 'Two new students (Jean Grey and Cyclops) in a boarding school meet and slowly fall in love' is a cliché story tool, but that's OK. The so called platonic love of Xavier was hilarious! Angel is darker and more intense here. We witness some very important moments in X-Men history, seeing what happens to the characters we know for a very long time etc. I need to confess that I was disappointed by Quicksilver here, because his new famous scene here is a rehash of 'The Days of Future Past' unfortunately and that one was better for sure. This one was just funny, maybe hilarious, but definitely not jaw dropping like the previous one. The relationship between Charles and Magneto is gripping and impressive here like Shakespeare plays. Wolverine scene was perfect and the most brutal Wolverine scene in any Wolverine film so far! The climactic final part is an action packed. It could have been better, but with perfect CGI, little emotion and some team work, it just delivers and the mind games were very exciting! 'Apocalypse' is a more entertaining and more colorful film than its predecessor. It has the perfect tone for a X-Men film.",8,5,9,24 July 2016
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A very smart and inventive story turns into a very conventional and soulless movie by a lot of additions and omissions
","The main problem of Benjamin Button is that the original story is probably one of the most smart and interesting stories ever written, but the movie cannot adapt this idea well because of several reasons that I will mention in order. The first reason of this is that the movie changes a lot of things in the short story. Why? Benjamin Button was not boring to me at all, but it was soulless and conventional. I read the book after watching the movie which I seldomly do and I saw the differences and saw that how Fincher turns an interesting and heartbreaking story into a soulless and usual movie. For example, in the end of the movie, I felt nothing, but the book made me stunned. The book is very short, in fact too short for such a story, but somehow, the author fits everything into 70, 80 pages and it becomes wholly satisfying, not scratchy at all. What a success! In the movie, the script writer wrote a screenplay that makes a two hour and a half movie. Why? To make it an epic in order to win Oscar? Then, can we say that Benjamin Button is Oscar-driven (and I believe that also audience-driven) If the movie had been 100 minutes for example, still it would not have made it great, but much better, because there are unnecessary additions and omissions in the movie which the main problem as I said. Aren't there some movies which are pretty short, but one of the best ones of all times like 12 Angry Men? From now on, my review will contain spoilers about the movie and the book both. In the book, the writer is the narrator and his observations are very interesting and amusing as well. To tell some parts of the story by using a narrator is a cliché way, but in this book, it sounds mesmerizing. In the movie, we hear the story from a diary of a woman by his daughter. This is real cliché! In the book, the beginning, the hospital part is much more realistic than the movie, the reactions of the father, the nurses, the doctor, all the people are much more realistic. Instead, the movie uses a cliché, an ill old woman in a bed and her daughter who reads her mother's diary, uninspiring. One more thing, in the movie, Button is born as a deformed baby, in the book, it is a tiny old man. Benjamin Button in the original story is a much more interesting and amusing character, also his questions and his answers are the same. The tone of the movie, especially the story telling are not magical, it is conventional. For example, the battle scene in the sea, entertaining, but audience-driven, unnecessary and conventional. In the book, the first days of Button in home are very interesting too, it does not need such scenes, but the movie does not focus on Benjamin Button, his character, his psychology, the situations he is in, the reactions of the people around him etc. I loved this part in the book: his father brings a rattle and Button takes it by a weary expression and jingles it at intervals. He buys toys, but Button is not interested in, he reads medical articles to find an answer for his weird situation. The relationship between Button and his father id very important too, but in the movie, it was just uninspiring and does not make any sense. Yes, the book is about love also, but in the book, the love affairs of Button are very realistic, but the point is that it is not the center of the story. In the movie, the little girl is interested in Button when he is an odd-looking old man. Is such a spoiled little girl interested in such an odd looking old man? What a mess! At night, she invites him to play under a table. This is ''two children are interested in each other while playing'' matter. Obviously, she likes him which opens door to pedophilia. And the images which Button and Daisy live in a flat that has no furniture were inappropriate for such a content by the way. The movie is almost a pure romance, love story. It means that an interesting story turns into a love story. In the book, his wife does not attract him anymore, because he gets younger, it tells something about love. One of the most stunning parts in the book takes place in the university. The movie does not even refer to this. He looses weight, gets weaken, so cannot be as successful as he does in the first year in the football team. These parts make you sorry for him. In the movie, the childhood years of Benjamin Button is told in a too scratchy way. We see him while playing piano and later on the roof, that's all. What is the point? He is very angry, he swears that seems odd. Yes, spiritually, he gets older, so being awkward is normal, but it is against the original idea that is much more consistent and brilliant. In the book, Benjamin becomes a normal child, nothing more nothing less, he plays toy soldiers etc. then is sent to a kindergarten. The author describes his childhood years in detail (yes, imagine, this is a 80 pages book) Only by two pages, two pages!, Fitzgerald tells his childhood and babyhood periods and it is so effective, we feel everything that baby Button feels. In the movie, we see that he is in Daisy's arms and closes his eyes. Honestly, I felt nothing. Besides being visually well and entertainment in some scenes, the only good thing in the movie is Brad Pitt, who is one of my favorite actors. That's all.",4,3,5,31 January 2010
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Only IMDb Bottom 100 # 1 satisfies me
","In order to write this comment, I scanned the film by fast forwarding to remember, did not watch it again, but still you can't imagine how it was agonizing. Resident Evil: Apocalypse begins with a bad opening scene that everything is explained in a scratchy way and we see pictures from the previous movie. As some people say, yes, mostly the scenes that zombies appear are very odd, so frustrating, it is not slow motion, it is not digital camera, I don't know what it is, but it is not entertaining for sure. Zombies do not walk very slowly and they are not fast like the zombie movies called next generation zombie movies. I cannot tell anything more! The whole movie is almost non stop action, but every action scene is extremely tasteless and sometimes too showy, so if you ask me no entertainment, I don't know whether there is such a word or not, but this movie is anti fun in most parts. Moreover, a heavy rock music in every action scene, helicopter sounds, walkie talkie sounds that's what the director understand from stylish film. Set designs are too superficial. There is a terrible looking and very ridiculous monster called Nemesis (wow! Nemesis is in the movie! people say) who can say only S.T.A.R.S. Even stop motion King Kong in 1933 was much more impressive than this. The plot is nothing, uninteresting. A high school student who plays the game would write a much much more better script, I am seriously sure. In a scene, the monster and Alice fight each other, but they are in a kind of tournament!! However, every bad has its worse, it gets more and more ridiculous, tasteless. This movie is the zombie version of Battlefield Earth to me, so the end of the world!",1,1,6,31 January 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The perfect mixture of art and entertainment
","I did not know that this movie has also a lot of haters who gave it only 1. I am not a blind Tarantino fan who gives every Tarantino movie 10 out of 10 and I am not one of the critics who try to cover up the flaws in his movies, but we should accept that he is a very good filmmaker. Personally, my favorite Quentin Tarantino film by far is Kill Bill Volume 1. It is quintessential cinema, also a pure mixture of art and entertainment. Kill Bill Vol. 1 has one of the best opening sequences ever, black and white visuals and that great music. I believe that put his directing talent aside, there are two things that he is great at: writing dialogs and music. Like Romance and Cigarettes, Kill Bill is a music collage from the old goods. All the tracks are great and the important thing, so coherent with the content. Visually and even including content, Kill Bill is one of the most colorful movies so far. This was the first cat fight I saw and probably there is not any other better. It seems that to shoot a cat fight scene is very hard rather than planned choreography. People don't fight in front of children in this movie, I know that Tarantino is not such a sensitive director, but I appreciated it. The second part of the movie is like a very stylish modern Western like No Country for Old Men. It is slow paced like Once Upon a Time in the West etc. The plot of the movie is also one of the most engaging and exciting ones, a revenge movie wouldn't be better. As for the anime, how a creative director Tarantino is. I had not seen any anime before, it made me like anime. However, this is quintessential anime, so my favorite in short length. Honestly, still I am not an anime buff at all and I haven't seen anime for a long time, but this is special for me, I watch it as occasion serves. The assassination part was too short, at least to me, because I did not want it end, that's the only problem. The maps recall atari games. Animes, atari games, Tarantino uses all of them. When I was a child, I loved the scenes in the movies which the hero of the movie chooses a weapon, sword from the collection, for example Red Sonja. While watching Kill Bill, I recalled Red Sonja. The story editing after the bride goes to Japan is weird (from the plane till the motorbike), in other words, there are time lapses, but this is not a flaw, it does not make us feel like the editing is scratchy and may be otherwise, the movie might have been pretty cliché, but still Tarantino could added somethings. The sword fights in this movie is the greatest, the longest, the most entertaining one and the most stylish one. I forgot how many times I watched this chapter, almost 50 from 2003 till now? The violence here is not sick at all, like Hostels or Rambo 4, it is not 'explotationish' like Saw movies and it is not disturbing like Romero's zombie movies, yes it is extremely bloody and violent, but somehow looks pure mixture of art and entertainment. It also deserves to be put in action cinema anthology. Especially editing and choreography is great. The last chapter. The place, atmosphere had seemed me superficial when I watched the movie for the first time at theater, but after, I thought that may be it is supposed to be. This chapter is so reposeful and still, it is like relieving tiredness part, not only for the characters, but also for us. Then, great Spanish-like music and Carnage of Flowers, my favorite track. By the way, I couldn't decipher the meaning of the ewer. As for the ending, one of the most impressive finals ever!",10,3,8,6 March 2010
Mission: Impossible II," A Fire Bird
","I see Mission: Impossible 2 as 'Hulk 03' of M:I movies. Both were hated and bashed by moviegoers, although those were excellent. For example Hulk 03 still has the best CGI and it has lots of action, but people remember the first 40 minutes, being very boring for them while the real boring one with bad CGI was the second one. People say that this sequel with a boring first half has a different style than the original first film, but wasn't it supposed to be like that? If you ask me, the first film was an exclusively stylish, low key espionage thriller, but it was little boring and slow paced at times. I liked and very enjoyed even the third movie with magical JJ Abrams touch! However, this second film perfectly delivers as an action packed and believe me that cliché virus story and the dated romance is not the point. This is a John Woo movie! In this sequel, now Ethan Hunt is a trained martial artist, a gunfighter, what would be the best that could happen? In this movie, the mission teller device does not terminate itself by smoldering, because this is a John Woo movie! In the second half, you are awarded with some incredible stunt work and action sequences! Also I think the best soundtrack for a M:I movie is here, too. The things that Hunt performs by that motorbike is amazing. If you expect a Bullitt type of a movie, of course you will be disappointed, but it is pure action and pure entertainment. If you look at the posters of the first two films, you can see that while the first one looks like a classical, old school spy thriller, the second one prepares you for a hell ride! We watch a different, tricky Ethan Hunt here equipped with lots of skills, almost like a single army and I love that! This is not a sophisticated or intellectual action film, but it is definitely not an empty or dumb summer blockbuster. The tone of the movie is just perfect for a M:I movie of course with a different touch by Woo! The mountain scene of the film is a hilarious and pure joy! The last 20 minutes of the film is an awesome action packed! Is it exaggerating? Yes. Is it overblown? No. Is it hilarious and cool? Definitely Yes! John Woo is a great action filmmaker and he doesn't make movies like this anymore.",10,4,7,11 June 2016
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The director couldn't catch the achievement of the first
","The Avengers Age of Ultron starts out with a soulless and pointless action sequence and the rest of the movie is not much different than this part. Since we don't know our heroes fight for who and why, we don't get excited for the adventure that our heroes have. Then, somehow, the cinematography is lifeless, the technical craftsmanship accomplishment is boring. Everything is too mechanic here. The villain of the movie is an artificial intelligence, again 'mechanic'. Everything about this villain is so cliché from his words to his evil plans to destroy the world, humanity, whatever. In the first movie, almost everything was perfect. This second installment is lack of heart and soul and an exciting adventure. The movie was like an empty roller coaster ride. The action and the fight scenes are uninspiring, lifeless. Everything happens just so quickly and it is overblown. Another thing the movie was lack of is the tension or clash between the allies. What makes the first movie spectacular was the sweet conflicts among the heroes. Returning to Ultron, it was not intimidating, not hilarious like Loki, honestly, it is just a machine! (Terminator fans, please don't be offended, this is a different case) In contrast with the promises by the director, this is not a darker movie. This is a boring action film. For example, adding romance into a movie doesn't make it deeper or sophisticated. Action is soulless and completely forgettable here except for two scenes. The first and the best is Hulk vs. Hulbuster scene which was fairly done. I have seen it dozens of times. The second one is the highway chase with Captain America and Black Widow, but it was like a copy of The Matrix Reloaded and nothing new. From the beginning, I don't like the appearance or the manners of this new Hulk (the first is favorite), but Hulk is OK here. The second half of the movie focuses on destruction like Man of Steel in a bad way. Do you want to hear Iron Man's witty comments? Thor's majesty? Captain America's work discipline? Hulk's anger? None of them is here. Loki? I miss him. Unfortunately, Quicksilver loses the game from the first minute, because we had seen a brilliant Quicksilver before. Scarlett Witch bewitched me, but I just couldn't get warm to her. I hope I will start to love her in future installments. Vision was completely unnecessary. Hulk is not like a gorilla or a fun mascot here which is good, but he is used like a pawn in this movie. Finally, Age of Ultron is sometimes dreadful, sometimes cheesy, sometimes dull, sometimes pretentious and mostly soulless sequel. I am very happy that the next adventures are going to be directed by Russo Brothers who gave us terrific 'The Winter Soldier'.",1,30,62,20 March 2016
The Dark Knight," The fourth part is called illusion. The magician shows us something ordinary as something magical
","Do you know tricky coins? It is an ordinary coin at first look, but two-sided. One picture on each side. When you start to turn it continuously, the picture seems like it moves or changes. I don't know the name of it, but in the movie, Sleepy Hollow, there was one. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is like this tricky coin. You look, it seems like a crime epic and sometimes innovative, sometimes stylish, sometimes entertaining, but when you stop turning, it becomes mediocre, sometimes far fetched, sometimes illogical, sometimes scratchy and sometimes insipid. The opening sequence is so impressive. It is clearly seen that Nolan inspired from Heat as he said. Then, in the bank, we see an 'unusual' bank manager. By that, Nolan tries to say my movie will be different. This was a realistic Batman movie, wasn't it? However, Batman flies at the minibus and he jumps off a high place, but does not get injured. As for his voice, it sounds good, but a bit unrealistic and in theater it sounded ridiculous because of the subwoofer. Yes, the movie has a few smart ideas, for example, while Bruce Wayne changes his clothes, there are scars, bruised wounds on several parts of his body or Nolan gets Batman enter a disco which is postmodern, interesting. And Heroes never make mistakes or heroes are always good. The Dark Knight does not say these. The movie is like a drama, a crime epic. The atmosphere, the mood are stylish. All these are good.. Not only The darkest Batman movie after Batman Returns, but also one of the darkest movies so far. The scene that Joker gets on the stage first is my favorite. A scene the character deserves. Nolan's Joker is appealing, interesting, but lack of many things that Jack Nicholson's Joker had. And there is ''the criminal who does not care about money'' cliché. To play Joker after Jack Nicholson's acting, performance had seemed impossible. It is like play Hannibal Lecter after Anthony Hopkins, but Heath Ledger did it. This happens once in a blue moon. His acting is excellent. However, Nolan's Joker is passive and not a colorful character as it should be. Nolan does not highlight any character, so can we say that Nolan does not care about the details? Because, it seems that the actions or personality of Joker was not emphasized. The killing scene in the billiard room was odd, everything is off screen, but may be otherwise, it would have been too disturbing, but Nolan could have found 'the middle' of it. The scenes take place in Hong Kong were familiar to me. It was like a copy of Mission: Impossible 3 and there is one more action movie with the same concept, but cannot remember the name. The second goof. The distance between two buildings are extremely far. I should say the third one. Batman and Rachel fall from the penthouse of a skyscraper and within an inch of hitting the ground. Batman opens his wings, but they don't even get injured and Rachel cracks a joke! It seems that Nolan and his brother cannot decide the past of Joker, because he tells different stories about how he became like that? but this is not real important, just a bit frustrating. The ceremony scene is great, you feel like you watch a crime epic. These are the moments that the magician deludes the audiences. This is a pretty conventional, usual movie. A showy car chase, people who get panicked in ships (unbearably uninteresting), remote controlled bombs which a dull and extremely cliché idea. There are some far fetched scenes either. The sick prisoner in the jail was far fetched, Joker should have found a way to do that! In this movie, Joker is not acute minded like Jack Nicholson's Joker, Nolan tries to show him smart, but fails. The escape scene can be an example. Or they say Joker wanted to be caught. No he does not. In contrast, the questioning sequence was brilliant, touching by parallel story telling. The moment that he bashes Joker's hand was disturbing. Also, this part was the most depressive part of the movie. However, later Batman hits a man's car mirror while he picks his teeth! If Alan Moore wrote these lines, I don't know what he would do, but I did not like the new Batman costume, it is not stylish, the one in Begins was the best, very appealing, impressive, but this is not. Two Face. He appears as Two Face in the last 30 minutes approx. You know, they did the same thing in Spider-Man 3. Nolan repeats this mistake deliberately. The injured side of his face is disgusting like a zombie, good news for horror fans and I had not expected a cute face, but it could have been better. By the way, the way of becoming Two Face was far fetched. Couldn't they find a better idea? As for action, the car chase was extreme and entertaining, but conventional, it does not raise the bar. And I hate that S.W.A.T. members always crack jokes while in danger. This is superficial. Then why? Because this is an audience-driven movie. Audiences should laugh and be entertained, it must be both! Even Joker's saying ''he's missed'' is cliché. Another goof. Joker shoots at the car, but no glass are broken, no bullet hole. What kind of bullet is this? Blank? Batmobile tumbles number of times, but Batman looks as if nothing happens, not even get injured! There is one more harsh car accident later that people look very well and sound! This is such a movie. Car accidents do nothing to people, blades don't stick or cut! The action sequence that S.W.A.T. and Batman encounter were one of the most tasteless action sequences ever made. Plus amateurish and showy shots (the glasses) As for the Batman Joker encounter, it was run of the mill and also insipid, I had expected much more.",8,4,7,15 February 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," The greatest gift to be given to science fiction lovers
","It opens a lot of dazzling pictures under the dawn of the man. The people who hated No Country for Old Men will hate this one too. Probably, this movie is the movie that is accepted as the most boring movie ever. It is not for everyone, but personally I did get bored at all. I was at high school when saw the movie for the first time. I had wondered it a lot and finally watched it and I remember, the time flied by. 2001 is quiet, still, beautiful and reposeful. It is pure space, pure science fiction. You know, Kubrick is a perfectionist director and sometimes, he does it, succeeds. 2001 is one of those movies. He gets the perfection. The movie has everything that can be in a science fiction film. He endeavors to catch every kind of picture in space and he does. That is one of the reasons that this is the greatest gift to science fiction lovers. Space has never looked that mysterious and beautiful at the same time. Really the music is very coherent with the visuals, so impressive. Visually, the movie is minimalist and very very stylish, no need to repeat that it is beautiful also. The set designs are great, the spacecraft which is sent to Jupiter is the best spacecraft I have ever seen in my life! Space has never looked that mysterious, unknown, obscure and creepy sometimes. For example, the scene that the astronauts come down to the ground first is creepy a bit. And just a note, I like the scenes they eat, visually colorful too. As for HAL, one of the most hypnotizing voices ever in cinema. Also as I see, it is the most intelligent artificial intelligent, computer ever and it makes the movie very interesting. A conscious existence. It is like a very very smart gentleman in dramas. The sequence which one of the astronauts goes in order to check and fix the problem with breath sounds is my favorite of the movie! One of the best sound editing ever. It is repeated by 2010, but unfortunately it seemed pretentious to me probably so that it is a repetition. By the way, I had not expected that things will come to that point. What a great script! In the second half, tension increases, but quietly. Not to spoil the movie, I won't tell who or what is it?, but there is a danger and it is more threatening than even the alien! The monologues of HAL, near the end left me with complex feelings somehow, but I hated it of course, it made me angry. The journey near the end, brilliant visuals, a space journey couldn't be defined better. That sequence is my second favorite. However, I learned that some people make fun of it by saying that it was like media player visualizations. The special effects look much better than even Avatar, you can bet on that! Just perfect. As for the final, I did not understand it exactly and honestly disappointed little, to me the weakest part of the movie, it could have been different, but no problem. I very enjoyed 2001, it is one of the movies that made me impressed the most.",10,0,2,13 March 2010
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Inventive story, good surrealism, realistic love, but the film itself is not touching, entertaining or fascinating as it was supposed to be
","This film which has a beautiful name was adored by the youth and loved by the critics. People said how smart and brilliant the story was, how beautiful the romance was and how nice the couple were. I found the characters realistic, I liked the guy and liked that nice girl with colorful hair style like her philosophy about life and I like the whole idea behind them. However, I just didn't find their story touching, heartbreaking or miraculous, so I was not that impressed. Are the technical aspects of the film such as editing etc. fascinating? Well, I don't think it is, but the film is pretty inventive and good surrealism overall, however, the film itself is little cold and there is a barrier between the characters and the audience. I couldn't feel the film. I cannot say style over substance problem, but something else was missing in the film. The supporting characters were not interesting, rather tedious. I will be honest, I don't know why, but I enjoyed The Science of Sleep more and thought it was a better film than 'Spotless Mind'. It delivers for me, but for this film, I appreciate the film for its inventive story, cinematography and cool love story with realism and the chemistry between Carrey and Winslett were perfect indeed, but I don't think it is a great story or an unforgettable experience. I believe that the story was supposed to be touching, but it suffers from style over substance issue. On the contrary, I find the main theme of the film significant, but I couldn't feel the film as I was not impressed by the whole picture.",6,2,5,20 March 2016
Life Is Beautiful," The script has some brilliant ideas, but the film is lack of interest, art and even heart
","According to some people, Life is Beautiful is one of the best movies of all time, and for some, the best movie of all time, yes, because the movie seems sweet, right? How? There is a family, we watch how the father and the mother meet, oh! how romantic and warm it is. Many people like such things, the meeting stories. Sometimes, it begins with saying in a rainy day... In the first half, we see some superficial slapstick comedy. Comedy is different, tragicomic is different, Life is Beautiful is not tragicomic till the final that shook me a little. It is clearly seen that Benigni inspired from Charlie Chaplin movies, but if you ask me, his film, Life is Beautiful cannot be even 'C' of Charlie Chaplin movies. People say that the first half is comedy, the second half is tragedy. No. There is nothing devastating or shaking in the movie. Benigni runs after only romance and comedy and little drama, but he does not show anything to us about the conflict or the intensity of the situation. If the story had been told in a different way, with a different mood (tragicomic and serious), it could have been a masterpiece. The idea is brilliant (a father who tries to conceal the (bitter) fact from his little son by saying all this is a game in a concentration camp), but the execution is zero. However, also the movie was excruciatingly boring, I don't know how did it happen, but for me it is the same as Fellini's Otto e Mezzo in terms of lacking interest. The (too heavy?) style including cinematography is lack of effect, lack of cinema feeling, thus the movie is lack of real art and even heart! I couldn't feel anything for the situations of the characters personally and the heartwarming, heartbreaking tone of the film didn't seem me sincere (I mean made for audiences) If you think that I exaggerate too much, please watch The Pianist or Schindler's List again to be sure (both are excellent movies by the way) Roberto Benigni was not the right person for this project I believe. His approach, execution is the same as street theater or child theater which no objection, but for such a story, almost unbearable. Yes, also the movie is not realistic, but it is not important, welcome to this fantasy, an alternative history or an inventive story, but as said, the movie can't carry that great idea.",1,5,12,25 January 2010
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Escapist entertainment at its worst
","Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is like The Avengers: Age of Ultron. After a spectacular, wonderful first film, it becomes a formulaic mess! Again, the movie opens by a scene which our heroes are threw into a mission for no reason and they are in danger, so they fight against an unknown enemy without building an introduction or tension. Just pure audiovisual joy. That's the key word to describe this movie: pure joy, but nothing else. We had high expectations and expected the movie to be greater than the first, but instead it was a total mess. The star of this movie is baby Groot but he is too cute. The mature Groot in the first movie was naturally funny and intimidating at the same time, here everybody tries to be amusing. The sentimentality in some scenes feel superficial. I just didn't buy it. Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone are cast in the same movie together years after Tango and Cash for the first time which is a historic moment, but they never come across during the movie. What??? The villain of the movie makes no sense and there is a relationship between the villain's motivation and Peter Quill's past, but why do you dig for the stories which were perfectly built in the first movie? What is wrong with you? We were exposed to the same forced sentimentality and story being tied to another story in the latest sequel of The Pirates of the Caribbean. Maybe, the most annoying relationship in the movie is between two sisters. It was ridiculous. I almost couldn't endure watching this character and her relationship with her sister, because it looks fake. It is just a plot device. The movie recalls the movie Zardoz which is nice, little Greek tragedy and definitely the best part of the movie is trying to escape from space prison part, but oh man, this was a total mess! Even the post credit scenes were boring and uninteresting. In the second half, we watch action, action and more action until we become mentally tired! The team has 'we are a family' message for you like Fast and Furious movies and as said before, the movie is very similar with its poster: a complete audiovisual mess! Lots of CGI, lots of noisy action and overblown visuals with no properly built up story, no development, no tension and no heart and soul. By the way, like most of the movies in these days, the villain explains everything one by one, evil plans are included, to make everything clear for us at some point! Jokes are mostly unfunny and forced, Gamora has a lesser screen time, it is a pity, Drax doesn't fight much this time and everything else is a mess except for great Stallone! This is a must see for 'GOTG' fans to follow the story, but keep your expectations low. However, your kids may love it!",1,5,10,28 August 2017
Titanic," As a romance, it is simple, as a disaster movie, it is underwhelming
","Let's start with James Cameron. He made the greatest action movie ever made and also one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time, The Terminator 2 Judgment Day. The Terminator was excellent too, but 2 surpassed even that. By only these two movies, he has become one of the greatest directors of all time, don't you agree? However, it was really weird that he wanted to make such a movie. Thus, Titanic does not look like a James Cameron movie at all and additionally it is lack of creativity, James Cameron creativity. You know, by considering The Terminator movies, you can see how a creative director James Cameron is. Titanic is an ordinary movie, a simple movie on all counts. Everything is simple that I will mention later. At that time, Leonardo Di Caprio was at the top, the beloved of teenage girls, in fact, young or not, females were admirers of him. I like Di Caprio and he is still liked, may be even more because of the performances he gave in his recent movies, but what I am trying to say is that I try to find out the reasons, why a lot of people love the movie and it broke a record at the box office, became the most watched film of all time? It was owing to Di Caprio? Well, I don't think so, I mean not only owing to him which is sad. Because as said the movie is simple on all counts. As for Kate Winslett, as an actress, she is one of my favorite actresses ever, I just love her, but players cannot save a movie, this is what I believe. The love story is simple. Let me summarize it one more time. A poor boy. A rich girl. And the rich (and black hearted) fiancée of that girl. The family of the girl want their daughter marry him, but she is not sure. Then, the poor boy and the girl meet and fall in love with each other. See? You know, James Cameron is rather an action (and science fiction) director, isn't he? and this is a disaster movie besides romance, isn't it? but this side of the matter, action, excitement are simple either. You expect the same masterful, perfectionist and creative level for Titanic, but it is not. I did not get satisfy on this count, because Cameron does not focus on disaster, he focuses on romance and this is weird. This is a three hours movie, but the disaster side of it is unsatisfying. Therefore, the people who had expected an exciting, suspenseful disaster movie disappoint like me. As for the Oscar issue, yes it broke a record in the Oscar history too, 11 Oscars! To me, there are two wrong decisions in the Oscar history. One is Titanic's 11 Oscar winning, the other is Shakespeare in Love won the best picture Oscar instead of Saving Private Ryan. I should confess that the other was much more painful, because if you ask me, to give the best picture Oscar to Shakespeare in Love while one of the other nominees is Saving Private Ryan is something like to give the best picture Oscar to The Notebook while one of the other nominees is 12 Angry Men. Returning to Titanic, the love story in it is not heavy or dull at all like Shakespeare in Love by the way which is good news and despite I am not female, it was real touching and at the end, my ears filled with tears. However, unfortunately these do not make the movie great. Let's talk about the branches which Titanic won Oscar. By the way, as for entertainment, yes I was entertained, but not very much. The best editing. Well, this is not Memento or Amores Perros, the editing was 'normal' in this one. The best cinematography. If it is one of the bests, then what is Amelie then for example or Across the Universe? The best costume design. What were the costumes, daily life costumes? Yes. Titanic was not a period movie exactly wasn't it? Even if it was, the costumes were ordinary, daily life costumes. The best art direction. Again, Titanic is 'normal' on this count. Amelie, 2001, Batman, these are the examples come to my mind now. If we talk about the themes of the movie, it is seen that they are simple either as everything else. Follow your heart, money does not bring happiness, believe immortal love etc.",5,1,3,18 March 2010
The Matrix Reloaded," I disappointed either, but still great
","The Matrix Reloaded is worse than The Matrix, but it is still great, despite it has some flaws. Automatically, people compared it with The Matrix and disappointed. However, this is not just another action movie, another thriller or another science fiction. This is Matrix! The opening scene repeats the first movie, but somehow impresses you. The dream of Neo is very inventive. Action in The Matrix Reloaded is not forgettable, not mild, not less. Content, story, atmosphere or action is peculiar to Matrix world (or should I say the directors) which, to me, make it difficult to say bad. Sometimes, people call some action movies non stop action, although, they are very slow paced or include less action, but The Matrix Reloaded is a great action movie apart from everything, but not shallow or hollow at the same time. In contrast, I disappointed in 2003 when I saw it for the first time at theater, because many action scenes consist of fighting, martial arts rather than gunfights like the first movie. I had expected much more gunfight scene. The action scenes in the first movie were recalling John Woo films, this is a different kind of action, but welcome. Those scenes are flowing, the choreography is almost flawless. There is Daniel Bernhardt who is a B movie star. When I was a child, I used to watch his movies. I wish they casted some other B movie stars such as Frank Zagarino, David Bradley, Marc Dacascos or Gary Daniels. By the way, at first, Wachowski Brothers had chose Jet Li for Seraph character, but they failed to agree with him. Jet Li in Matrix. It sounds great of course, even if the screen time of this character is very less. He was not an interesting character either, so in fact not a big loss. Zion was the most disappointing thing in the film. The Zion people are like party people rather than desperate people who wait for being saved. They look happy (and passionate!) The dance scene was bizarre and sometimes unnecessarily sexual, what was the point? It looked like a video clip in MTV. Do Wachowski Brothers try to show that they try to enjoy the life, because they may be killed by the sentinels soon? I don't think so and if it is, not a good idea. The fight scene with tens of Ajan Smith is the longest fighting scene of all times probably, it is too exaggerating, in some moments CGI is eyesore, it seems like animation, some acts are far-fetched, but it is very fun, I watched this sequence times without number. My favorite fighting scene is the one takes place in Merovingian's place. Thanks to Yuen Woo Ping, it is very flowing and great. The most interesting and creative new characters are The Twins. However, they seem a very hard case, very formidable adversaries, they have the potential, but they are not. It seems that the directors are not interested in those characters enough, also their screen time is less. And the car chase scenes. I disappointed a lot when saw it at theater, because I had expected much more, but I still watch it often. It looks showy, for example sunglasses whatever they do, unnecessary slow motions, a heavy music etc. but one of the longest and also best car chases of all times. In The Matrix Reloaded, the question ''what is Matrix?'' is almost answered after Neo enters through the door. This part is very complex, but the essence of Matrix. If in fantasy genre, there is The Lord of the Rings legend, in science fiction genre, there is The Matrix, even if Revolutions was pretty bad.",9,0,0,6 January 2010
The Fountain," The story seems original, but if you look closer, you can see that it is cliché and its visuals are no more than a slide show
","The Fountain seems like a different film, it is a combination of past, present and future with different settings and stories. It is a hybrid movie, it has science fiction elements, it is a drama about a doctor and his ill wife, it is epic, there are Mad Max- like punk? tribes, it is a postmodern film, but none of those makes The Fountain a good film. The present story is the main story, it is the starting point, but this main story is very cliché that we saw even in some B movies! A doctor's wife is sick. He uses science to try to cure his wife who he loves. That's the story of the film. What a simple story! The worse thing is that this story doesn't go any further and we can't feel the romance or the pain either. Other than this, yes, as some other audiences said, the movie is extremely pretentious. The images, all those visual elements doesn't make any sense, instead it was like a long and very boring slide show. As a moviegoer, I very rarely call a movie boring, but The Fountain just pushed my limits. The images, some of those were beautiful, yes, but it is like all those images has not any supportive or enough background or emotion. It is called pretentious, right? This is not style over substance stuff, because there is not any real story for this feature length film, there are rather some ideas. I said the man who tries to save his wife is the brief story of the film, but it is more like a sum of ideas rather than a real, interesting story. Hugh Jackman doesn't fit his role, also he was not very good in this, Rachel Weisz was more adaptable than him, but both of them were literally missing in the movie. It seems that even they didn't believe the story, the movie. This film proves that all of the different time zones, different stories films are not good, just because it sounds or looks different. If you liked Moon, you will like The Fountain, there is no doubt about it! I couldn't like Moon either, because it was the same as The Fountain. No heart and soul. The Fountain has no heart and soul, no dramatic scene or twist. The movie's pseudo weightiness was over for me. This isn't high art for me, this isn't entertainment, this isn't a cinematic journey, this is something else, but I am sure about one thing, it was a zest-less experience.",1,2,7,26 June 2013
The Departed," Disappointed at theater, but after a second watch, changed my mind
","I was pretty disappointed with the movie when had watched it at theater for the first time (had difficulty in following the movie especially, found it too fast paced etc.) it was just a good movie, but months later, I watched it on DVD again and changed my mind almost completely. There is everything that a cop movie could include. Of course, this is not the best Scorsese film or my favorite Scorsese film, it is Taxi Driver, but a great movie. And people compare it with the original Asian version (they don't have to do), then they say hard things about this movie. I was disappointed not because of only one reason, but the most problematic thing in the movie was editing, the movie is one of the most exhausting movies ever made, if you ask me. It is like there is no break even to breathe, no break between the events, so a too exhausting experience like he first half of Bourne Ultimatum. The events run, run and run, any kind of method is not used. I don't like the movies has such editing, because you cannot assimilate things. As for the plot, despite this is not an original work, a new version, the story is brainwave, in other words, it is brilliantly written, it adapts 'the idea' almost excellently. I see The Departed as a crime epic, yes it is an epic, not like American Gangster which is pretty good, but usual. The actors. Matt Damon is one of my favorite actors, but the point is that may be because of his persona, may be because of Bourne trilogy, himself (and his character) is one of the factors that make the movie very good. Damon excellently reflects his character's two face. And his unbelievable actions throughout the movie. Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors too, but his acting is not overrated, great performance. In addition, his colorful, but at the same time maniac character, Costello is not likable, but very interesting and colorful. I am proud of Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg. Yes sometimes such things happen, a man comes and exhibits an unexpected and excellent performance. I don't like Mark Wahlberg honestly, but in this movie, he goes beyond himself. He is so funny and so serious also, his character. The battle of words scene between Dignam and Ellerby is the peak of Martin Scorsese movies, you know, in Martin Scorsese movies, characters are ribald and as I know, Casino was a record in terms of strong language. The scene was very funny and a bit shocking and makes a reference to Scorsese movies I believe. The best part of the movie, that deserves being in cinema anthology, starts when everything turns into a mess. Orders, coincidences and bad luck. I don't know why, but to witness the greatness of the movie, just watch this scene. It was one of the reasons that made me changed my mind. I don't know the disappointment reasons of other people, but it should not related to the script, acting or direction (except exhausting story telling), because this is a very well written, acted and directed movie with some bitter twists. The success of it comes from the details mostly and its complexity in the story. The movie has flaws, but not little flaws. For example the love triangle is so far fetched and unrealistic. They encounter at home, then have sex. There is an envelope matter which is weird. However, we can interpret it as silliness of Costigan. By the way, almost all the people around me complain about the ending. I have not any problem with the ending. What is the name of the movie? Plus, no uninteresting or dull character. Now it is time for Di Caprio. He raises his bar too. The situations he is in and his relationship with Costello are very exciting, very engrossing, but sometimes harsh and sad. Scorsese should have won the best director Oscar absolutely by The Taxi Driver first, but this is not a movie which I would complain or bother so that he won it by this.",8,0,0,7 August 2010
There Will Be Blood," A very powerful film and different on the subject
","There will be Blood is an example of quintessential cinema, also it is an entertainment as an adventure film and this is Daniel Day Lewis's second greatest performance after My Left Foot. Even if it is not superhuman like My Left Foot, it was amazing. As for direction, as said, this is a masterful work with a powerful story telling. Honestly, I had not supposed that Anderson was such a master director, despite I have seen Magnolia which is a masterpiece for me. At this point, it is frustrating that some people find the movie very boring, slow paced and even some say that nothing happens in this movie! This is funny, because There will be Blood is not an art house film-I don't mean that art house films are boring, but this is an adventure film like Gone with the Wind or something. This is an adventure with a rare and important plot which had not been handled before: oil! As known, Anderson inspired from the another masterpiece The Treasure of Sierra Madre. The story is very adventurous here and Daniel Day Lewis is Bogart? Anyway, the moments take place in the train station affected me a lot, for me it is may be the zenith of the movie. It was touching but in a silent and deep way. However, I had a problem with this movie which is the final act. This is the only disappointment for me. The final act clashes with the atmosphere, the tone, the spirit of the movie that is built throughout. it is like the movie steps into a new age and the movie turns into something postmodern and this post-modernism doesn't fit the movie. Then, Daniel Plainview starts to talk about milkshake, milkshake??? Also, the twin stuff was far fetched and not convincing.",9,4,6,15 February 2010
The Wolf of Wall Street," Sex, Drugs, Money, Swearing, Swindling and Lots of Drink, but what else?
","Let's be honest, The Wolf of Wall Street is hilarious but also an empty ride. Directed by a master filmmaker, Martin Scorsese doesn't help that the movie is great or something. The movie is filled with sex, drugs, money, games, drink, girls etc. but really nothing more! I know that this is the story of a guy whose life consists of such kind of activities, but the problem is that The Wolf of Wall Street is just a hilarious biopic, an entertaining popcorn flick, a dark comedy, an amusing adventure, but no more than that. This is a rise and fall story and during the whole movie, you don't feel bored. Comparing to Scorsese's old classics, this is just an ordinary movie. It doesn't feel like a Scorsese flick. The Big Short, American Hustle, American Made, this movie is in the same category. Some jokes, some scenes are amusing, but there is no emotion, thrill or an amazing piece of cinema feeling in this movie. Oliver Stone's Wall Street is a much, much better film, but I understand that this movie is for our generation and Scorsese adapts himself into this generic, formulaic storytelling instead of putting his one of a kind signature. Everyone with me at the theatre left satisfied and pleased except for me I guess. Jonah Hill does his part as a comedian, Di Caprio gives a hilarious performance, but not among the best (may I remind you The Revenant, The Departed, Django Unchained etc?), Matthew McConaughey steals all the scenes he is in, Margot Robbie plays a sexy housewife and in the end, this movie is considered to be a masterpiece!",5,2,2,15 October 2017
The Wrestler," Hated, because unconventional?
","I have realized that many people don't like unconventional movies. The Wrestler is an example of this like No Country for Old Men. Despite, it is in IMDb Top 250, some comments or posts in the forums proves that, people say very hard, even nasty things, there are a lot of people who say that they hated it. The Wrestler was a very flowing film to me, the time flies by. By the way, the background music was great, probably one of the most coherent musics with the content ever made. Some people say that nothing happens in the movie. Many things happen, but it just does not excite those people's interest. The extreme wrestling scene in the middle of the movie must be mentioned. High adrenalin. At the same time very sad. I suppose that some get bored of hearing Mickey Rourke's name like he came back etc. However, he really deserves, his performance is to me one of the best performances of all time. And I did not see Milk, but probably I would have given the Oscar to Rourke. The Wrestler is not a great movie only so that Rourke's performance is great. The shots in Aranofsky's previous movies were too short, sometimes so exhausting, in this movie, it seems that he changed his style. The habits of the directors do not change, but he did. Otherwise, for such a movie, such a content, his style would be inappropriate which means a disappointing movie. The Wrestler is a very still movie. Throughout the movie, in some scenes, we see Rourke's back, the camera follows him. It did not annoy me, it was interesting, but probably the director did not do that to make the movie interesting, to get us feel watching a documentary, so it looks natural also. Marisa Tomei's character is cliché, but very realistic, her performance contributes to this realism too. Mickey Rourke's this character was very interesting, colorful and striking, he (or his character) makes the movie much more appealing. It was also a very realistic and deep character study. He is not as tough as he is in the ring. He uses his strength only in the rings. He is a little bit meek in daily life, very patient, he does not get angry easily. May be, he roars when necessary. I felt like having a heart attack when he has. I loved the scene take place in the super market. By the way, the whole movie is very consistent in terms of story telling and very stylish direction. The only weak point of the movie is the final. As an audience who satisfied with the final of even Old Men, this did not make me satisfied. It was too indistinct, so prepare yourself, but ultimately welcome. Even if The Wrestler is not excellent because of this, it is one of my all time favorite movies.",10,2,3,2 January 2010
Shooter," Honestly, a dull action movie!
","I extremely disappointed with Shooter, because I had expected a fast paced action movie with great action scenes, but waited, waited and waited. It has potential, but the movie is too slow paced, no enough action and also action scenes are mild, it does not rock. Visually it looks good, but nothing more. There are some action movies which slow paced and mild and unfortunately, I guess it is just bad luck, in some of them, there is Mark Wahlberg. Shooter and Max Payne for example. I did not like Max Payne at all (and almost everyone did not) because to me, it was too slow paced either. We believe the posters, the trailers, but the movies become disappointing. At the beginnings of the movie, in the scene that Swagger tries to save the president from the assassination, there is a goof; the bad cop's visibility distance is perfect and he is not an amateur, but he misses Swagger. Is it possible that he does not want to do it? May be, otherwise, it is a goof. Returning to action, absolutely, I don't call this movie action, it is a thriller (but a bad one) The biggest action scene is the one takes place in the/in front of the cottage. However, even this is not long enough and seemed me mild. The snowy scene on the mountain is well visually, but not an action scene. Our man is wounded and goes to a woman and those parts steal a lot of time of the movie. Why they do that? Because of lack of enough budget? No, I don't think so. Because, directors are too lazy to make action scenes which is backbreaking? May be. Think about The Shooter and think about Die Hards, Mission: Impossibles, Bourne Supremacy etc. If you still think that Shooter is an action packed, then there is nothing about it.",1,3,8,19 December 2009
Inception," Mr. Nolan is like a cold mathematician
","Where should I start? It would be better to get straight to the point. Firstly, despite the idea is brilliant, in other words, generally the story of the movie is brilliant, ideas don't make a movie great as just complicatedness doesn't make a movie good. By this movie, personally, I have understood that Nolan is not 'my director'. The Dark Knight was also a serious disappointment for me and Batman Begins was just a summer blockbuster (Following and Prestige were very very good) As for Inception, the biggest flaw of the movie is the movie is lack of heart and soul, in other words, it is cold. The characters are cold, the atmosphere is cold, the reactions are cold, because they are in dream? Well, I don't think so. It causes what then? I didn't much care about the intrigue, couldn't identify with the characters, so the most important problem of the movie is its dramatic structure. The second is the 'dreams' itself. You know, the agent of dreams in cinema is David Lynch. Why? Because he shoots creative, intriguing, sometimes meaningless as it should be and surreal dream sequences. The dream sequences in Inception can only impress the architects, mathematicians and some businessmen (because there are a lot of men in black suit) It is because like his approach towards Batman, he sticks to reality. Despite the visual effects are jaw dropping, 'the street bending' scene is my favorite, it doesn't help much. By the way, honestly, I couldn't understand the trick of Ariadne, for example, is it planned or impromptu? If the point is impressiveness, well I was much more impressed by Sucker Punch for example which has been exposed to harsh reviews. The movie also has not any dramatic twist, epic scene (except for a few moments) or real mystery which had been all necessary in my opinion. Can we say that the movie was low key? Thirdly, some, may be many action scenes seem pointless and ineffective. Especially the 'snow' sequence. It was too long without real entertainment or excitement. There is not any problem with the cast (except the fact that in contrast with the majority, I think that Leonardo Di Caprio's performance in this movie was just good, not his best performance so far, it is nothing, for example in comparison with What's eating Gilbert Grape!), but it is a bit disappointing that Nolan often uses the same actors in his movies. A note: Michael Caine's character might be a tribute for his character in Children of Men. If you ask me, the best part of the movie is the 'train scene' It was the only scene that I was dramatically involved and got excited. The 'gravity' sequence was just interesting. I didn't find it epic. Finally, about the plot, I didn't find the starting point creative, brilliant or exciting. I mean the concept of choosing a businessman for inception, weren't there better options? In other words, the main story was too poor for the concept. However, if we consider Nolan's style, to tell a story about the world of business, might be exciting for him. However, if we consider the hype, the rating, the reviews etc. it seems that Mr. Nolan has deluded audiences again or we have been incepted.",7,6,9,9 August 2011
Arrival," It is not an academic essay or an important scientific research, it is just a flat sci-fi drama
","Arrival is a flat, stagnant and pretty uninspiring sci-fi drama with clichés throughout. If you are a science fiction fan or having an interest in alien invasion movies, it is a little possibility that you will be pleased and satisfied, because this film is not about aliens or the world society's reactions after the possibility of an alien invasion. It is more about communication, language barrier, linguistics etc. but it fails to deliver its messages and themes because of several flaws. All those posters and trailers evoke a mystery, suspense and little action, but the film's point is pretty different. We have a main character who is a go-getter type of a woman, she is talented, determined, an alpha female which is another cliché, but that's OK. Cliché casting choices? Never mind. Her character has also a sad background which is an emotional exploitation of the audience! The movie asks some important questions about life, death, future and past, our destiny and the words we speak, but it focuses on a few characters and doesn't care about the rest. The real flaw of this film is that the story becomes too personal after a while which is another famous cliché and unavoidable fate of blockbuster movies: the chosen one! I have a problem with the aliens in this movie. The envisagement of them is uninspiring. They look like giant octopuses and sometimes they feel like they are pets. I call this Transformers syndrome, because since the creators of these creatures are humans, they think like a human which causes a creativity problem in this movies such as a robot with beard and cigar or an octopus-like alien etc. The film also deals with Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, but this is not a comprehensive academic essay, a documentary or an important scientific study on linguistics, this is just a sci-fi drama, that's why I believe that it is overrated. Arrival has some statements about war and peace, unity and solidarity, but it is not effective and it drops a few plot holes into the story. The editing of the movie is smart, honestly brilliant, but no more than that. Arrival is not a thought-provoking or a very deep film, is it? These movies such as Arrival, The Fountain etc. don't reveal the secret of universe or the meaning of life. By the way, Arrival is not an action film definitely and I didn't have such an expectation. I knew that this movie wouldn't be like Independence Day, but this is not the point. The movie fails to deliver panic, chaos, suspense and paranoia well thanks to the script or low budget, I have no idea about that.",4,1,4,30 September 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," It relies on the technical aspect, but ignores the substance and this creates a pretentious film with no drama to deliver
","The director is a genius. The cast is fantastic. The filmmaking seems brilliant. However, the result? When I heard that Inarritu would make a comedy, in fact black comedy, I approached this idea with suspicion, but later after the posters, trailers and the story revealed, I was excited enough to see and appreciate the film. Birdman is a typical example of 'style over substance' word by word. The one shot nature of the work makes the film worthy and technically brilliant, also it is an important event for the history of cinema, but there was no emotion among those very talky characters. This is a very talky movie. People talk, talk and talk, so there is no time to think about, there is no time for 'art'. This is a different type of art house movie. The idea of a disgraced actor played by great Michael Keaton ironically who has an alter ego Birdman (need to say Batman?) sounds very interesting and emotional, but the film ignores all and just deals with technical wizardry. Michael Keaton is great, but there is not any single character who you can develop empathy or sympathy in this movie. They just talk! This is that kind of a film that all those great actors or actresses come together in a movie, but the film is not as glorious as the dreamy cast. I am sorry, but I think the upcoming movie 'Hail Caesar!' will be much like the same. Emma Stone was remarkable, Naomi Watts does her parts, Amy Ryan is the same, but Edward Norton was just there... One of the greatest actors of all time! He was like a ghost. Again nothing to deliver. The fall and ruined life of our main character could have been delivered in a different way, a more powerful, devastating way like Mickey Rourke's The Wrestler. However, what we have is a very pretentious artsy film. Of course, there are some very interesting or funny moments in the film, but other than this, it feels like an empty style over substance film. Style for style. The criticism of mainstream cinema, entertainment industry or fame works pretty well, but it remains an idea rather than a story in the film. I prefer Robert Altman's masterpiece The Player over this film. I appreciate that Inarritu takes risk and tries different type of films, but the result is not spectacular. You cannot enter the movie, it just spits you out. Some people call Birdman as quintessential cinema, but if you ask me it is rather 'anti-cinema'. I appreciate the movie for what it is, I can appreciate its technical aspect and the making of the film, but I didn't enjoy the movie a bit, because the movie was not natural, it was far fetched thanks to its pseudo intellectual manner. The story includes a tragedy, but the movie just cannot deliver it to us. If you like Fellini's Otto e Mezzo, you will love this film.",1,5,10,7 February 2016
The Big Short," It is like an informative TV show episode with famous stars
","The Big Short has a vital importance in my life, because it is the first movie which I walked out during the intermission in my life. I enjoy movies such as The Wolf of Wall Street, Moneyball, but since The Big Short has no entertainment value, it is a different type of a film. What about art? Please, next! Story? There is no dramatic material, but yes, there is a story, with two words, it is economic crisis, but the film itself is too informative. It was a motion picture, but on the other hand, not exactly. As for the acting, Bale just delivers, he was incredible! Steve Carrell was appreciable, but he was not as amazing as he was in Foxcatcher. The Big Short seems a hilarious joy ride, but it is not (considering only the first half of the film) The director tries some tricks to make the movie interesting, but it does not help. The Wolf of Wall Street which has a similar tone and plot looks like a real masterpiece in comparison with The Big Short despite 'Wall Street' was not a perfect or amazing film considering other Scorsese masterpieces. As for Ryan Gosling, he is a joy to watch, but his character was boring. Brad Pitt? In the first half, he appeared for three minutes or something, then in the break, I walked out and I don't know about the second half. All those confusing and senseless terms make the movie more unbearable, but it was OK. Since my cinema experience was almost zero, I just couldn't make it. I don't know how can somebody tell us this story in a different way, but if there is not, maybe this could have been a mini TV series, semi documentary, a TV show or even a 'mockumentary' Sincerely I apologize from all the actors in the movie who gave their best effort, the director and all the cast members and crew.",1,17,42,6 February 2016
Raging Bull," As a drama, it is very good, but as a sport movie, it fails
","Raging Bull is a real stylish drama and it has Robert De Niro, but it looks like Martin Scorsese's gangster movies rather than a sport, boxing movie. This is why it was a big disappointment to me. Therefore, the hype (the greatest boxing film ever made, much better than Rocky series) is just a hype, not true. This is not a sport movie and I know that Martin Scorsese said that he hates sport movies, so he passes over boxing scenes quickly (the boxing scenes are too short) thus there is not enough material on boxing in the movie. Scorsese cannot create his own boxing movie, instead he does what he wants to do, he does what he is good at, a crime drama (that also recalls his other gangster movies as said) Therefore, Raging Bull is not the story of a boxer, instead it is like the story of a mafia boss who has some troubles while trying to rise. I think that there is a polarization among people. According to the first group, Rocky series are unrivaled, especially the first one is great, according to the other group, Rocky is nothing in comparison with Raging Bull, it is better by far as a sport film. Raging Bull is a very good drama, but it fails as a sport movie. By the way, personally I prefer Rocky (especially the first movie, the third movie and the fourth movie) A critic says that Rocky is a thickheaded boxer who does not add anything to the movie, he just fights. He does not have to be smart and when it comes to Raging Bull, they say boxing scenes were great, especially camera usage and editing. No, this is not true, a hype! And by the way, according to some, Raging Bull is Rocky of intellectual people. I don't know why I feel like this, but it seems that yes it is. Scorsese's direction, carefully planned great black and white cinematography and Robert De Niro with one of the most realistic make up makes Raging Bull a must see, but as a sport film it is very disappointing. As for the boxing scenes, if you look for great boxing scenes (except for Rocky), I recommend you the opening scene of John Woo's Broken Arrow.",6,6,12,22 December 2009
The Silence of the Lambs," Phenomenal, but flawed
","Silence of the Lambs is a phenomenal movie. May be it was Anthony Hopkins's best performance, or one of the bests, and the character Hannibal Lecter was unforgettable, phenomenal too. Besides those, there were a few scenes which deserve to be put in cinema anthology! However, this doesn't mean that the movie is a quintessential masterpiece. There is no problem with Jodie Foster, she shines in the movie and she is one of my all time favorite actresses. Her portrayal was so realistic in the movie. The first conversation between Starling and Lecter was epic, unforgettable. I used to watch this scene regularly, after I had bought the movie. And the famous jail scene... Brilliantly horrifying! Jonathan Demme shot this scene honorably, but this does not spread to the movie in general. At times, the movie feels like a TV episode. There are some chilling moments which also works like a real, pure detective movie, but then it turns into an ordinary drama again. There could have been more suspense or mystery. I found the climax of the film pretty weak and low key in a bad way for such a phenomenal movie, I had expected a powerful, absorbing, intriguing final, but there was none. And there is one more flaw in the movie and It is the character Buffalo Bill! He has no background, even no existence! I mean no character study which is weird for such a movie. He is not the focus of the movie, but also he is the key character of the movie. No real investigation, no cat and mouse game, no murder scene... Buffalo Bill seems like he is not an appropriate character for Silence of the Lambs, because it has no point rather than he is Buffalo Bill! Buffalo Bill might have been suitable for Friedkin's Cruising, for instance. Francis Dollarhyde in Manhunter was an unlikeable character for me, but at least, it was a well portrayed character.",7,1,5,30 December 2009
The Dark Knight Rises," Where is The Batman?
","From the beginning, I have appreciated 'the crime epic' or 'the crime saga' approach of the director towards Batman, despite I don't stick with realism in cinema, however in this movie, Nolan goes too far and we watch a movie which has almost zero effect on the audience as a Batman movie! What Roland Emmerich did in 2012 is what Nolan did in this movie! I don't pay to watch a crime film without Batman! In TDKR, Batman is like a metaphor, yes believe me, in the first half (80 minutes approx.) we watch Batman in only one or two scenes and the part (the chase) was may be the best part of the movie! As some other moviegoers said, it is all about story telling with no break, but no break! You can't feel the film, because it is like you have no time to do that! How can I say, the movie is exhausting, you feel exhausted, yes that's the word! And if you suppose that in the second half, Batman rises immediately, my answer would be not exactly! As said, TDKR is about Bruce Wayne, other characters, themes, but not Batman! Therefore I felt cheated. And I always think that Mr. Nolan is not a good action director. In the first half, Batman has an interesting gadget, I have no idea what was the function of it, but he doesn't use it! So? Yes, the movie has plenty good action, it has its moments, but I can't say it is great! Nolan shoots chase scenes, in all of his Batman movies, there is chase sequence, but is this enough? There are some other type of action in TDKR, but don't expect an action-packed! (I'd expected) There is no character development for new characters except for Bane. As for Catwoman, Catwoman is not even spelled in the movie! Was she really Catwoman? What was her motivation? She was not a dominant character as it should be! Even the introduction of the character was poor! And she could have been sexy! We can't see even her body! A different interpretation? well, the problem here is Nolan doesn't care about the characters, it was the same in Batman Begins (Scarecrow) it was the same in The Dark Knight (Batman himself) He just puts a character forward, Catwoman, a burglar, OK next! Miranda Tate, a business woman, OK next! Something like that. John Blake is a well written character, a cop, at least he has a motivation! However, for example Miranda Tate is out of place! It feels like Nolan likes Cotillard and wants to work with her, they know each other from Inception etc. Mrs. Cotillard is a very beautiful and talented actress, but in this movie, she is just out of place. Bane is the scene stealer, the performance of Tom Hardy is great, his voice is brilliant, he is evil, he is bad-ass, but he disappoints because of two reasons: first, as you know too, in Nolan's story, Bane doesn't use steroids or he isn't exposed to poison known as venom, so he doesn't grow bigger. Second, the twist at the end ruins this character very badly and there is a scene which you feel like he is a henchman! And wasn't Bane big like in the comics in the teaser trailer? Was I cheated again? The final parts which are called climactic by a lot of people were not that climactic and there is nothing different or original! I expected to be amazed, surprised etc. but it didn't happen. This is a cold movie! The movie has not any impact on you, you can't feel the film, almost zero emotion throughout the film (like Inception) but except two part! The fight between Batman and Bane and the chase in the first half! If the whole film had been like that, I would have given 100 out of 10! The cinematography and the art direction are not dominant like The Dark Knight, the editing is like non-stop events with no break (now joke time! the only break was the regular 10 minutes break in the middle of the movie!) Also the film was too noisy at times. I didn't find the movie overlong, but what I get bored was watching a Batman movie without Batman! I found Batman Joker showdown in The Dark Knight anti climactic, low key and short, but this time it was much worse! That's why movies like Terminator 2 are masterpieces, am I wrong? You can't imagine how it ends! I almost found it ridiculous! TDKR is not a 'rich' film especially in the content, so it is like 'poor man's Batman movie' Personally my another problem with TDKR was it has zero 'comic book feel' At least, TDK had it at times! After some statements of Nolan, the fate of John Blake made me laugh! Miranda Tate's climactic plan was boring and how can I say? it had no excitement or tense, because it was simple and cliché? Especially for such an 'epic' movie! Doesn't this epic final deserve originality? By the way, Nolan doesn't even know how to shoot a snowy scene or he just doesn't care about it! Another problem, the mystery and suspense in the trailers were missing. And realism doesn't mean that the movie is deep or in comparison with other super hero movies, it is deeper, No, No! That's because Nolan is not interested in characters, instead he is 'event driven' And couldn't the war between Batman and the other bad guys (the chaos) be handled better? The only good thing about this movie for me was Nolan avoids 'crowd-pleaser humor' in this movie! The Dark Knight Rises may be a well made film, but as a 'Batman' movie, it is quite empty.",1,54,107,28 July 2012
Iron Man," Solid and cool with some flaws
","Iron Man's summary with two words would be solid and cool. It is a highly entertaining, amusing film also with very well written dialogs. However, the film is not brilliant or that great because of some flaws. Before this movie, I had liked Downey Jr. but became a fan of him by this movie. Iron Man could be seen just for him and the character h created in this movie! Jeff Bridges's acting is great and despite he is not an interesting or bad-ass villain (he is a businessman) he is the second star of the movie and he is memorable. He is a cliché character a little bit (a black-hearted and hard-nosed capitalist), but Bridges makes him pretty deep and realistic. There are a few logical goofs and it seriously disturbed me. For example, while trying his new Iron Man equipment, he hits to the ceiling very badly. No one can stand against such a strike or the scene which he falls to the ground from miles, it causes person to die or at least heavily injured. As said, The movie is highly entertaining from the first minute till the last, as for action, there are not tons of action unfortunately, it can't change the fact that this is an action film. Especially, the scene that he tries to save a group of people and the jet scene were so well done. The climax fight of the movie was a bit short and far from being unforgettable, but a solid one. Final fights are generally waited with high expectations and mostly only a few of those meet the expectations. In terms of political background, the origins of some bad guys or the very American tone annoyed me, but I didn't mind much. By the way, there is a brilliant thing about this movie; the relationship between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts is different from all the same kind of movies here. It was twisty. However, in the end, the movie could have been better.",6,2,4,25 November 2009
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman vs. Superman? You must be kidding!
","The problem with 'BVS: Dawn of Justice' is the built up tension between the two men and their motivations against each other to defeat. Years, but years ago, when Freddy vs. Jason was released, with no expectation, I saw and liked the movie at home theater. The spin-off showdown was executed pretty well and it was fun. However, 'Batman v Superman' cannot give us goosebumps or even little excitement. Ben Affleck is great, Bruce Wayne is great, as for Batman, he looks dark and intimidating and the best hand to hand combat in Batman franchise is here, but thanks to some cheesy visual effects, that also the movie itself suffers from, ruins the experience! In some scenes, Batman looks like a computer generated character from a PC game and it really bothered me! There is something wrong with the way of storytelling in this movie. We don't care about the 'gladiator' fight between the two, maybe because the tone of the movie is cold? In contrast with Zack Snyder's masterpiece 'Watchmen', 'Batman v Superman' is pretty heartless and soulless. The opening sequence of the movie is amazing!The connection between the destruction in 'Man of Steel' and Bruce Wayne's anger against Superman considering the casualties is very smart. However, the very beginning of the movie was not that impressive, because I know Mr. Snyder can do much better. I think, the movie is not too dark as claimed by some people, the problem is not being too dark, it is the editing, the storytelling, the motivations, the clichés, the visual effects and so on.. Also, the movie has not a comic book tone or atmosphere which is an unforgivable mistake! Visually, the movie was just flat and at times, it was dull which is very surprising. The purpose of this movie should have been focusing on the showdown between two of the greatest super heroes on earth, but instead, the purpose of this movie is to make a way for the upcoming Justice League movies. You make an almost three hour long movie, but you fill that movie with lots of other stories and characters. The expected fight between the two is a pure disappointment. It has a few priceless moments, but in the end, it was too short and not extraordinary, unforgettable or magnificent as it should be. Mr. Snyder didn't do 'justice' to it! Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor wasn't bad, but annoying. His evil plans felt like we were watching a 'Pinky and The Brain' episode. Doomsday? Ohh, man! Producers must abandon the idea of releasing a big monster in every big budget action movie! Therefore, this 'monster movie' mood stabs the film even more. In the last half, the movie speeds up and again we see lots of destruction, explosion and mayhem! Batmobile is great, but in some action moments, the visual effects ruin everything again. Gal Gadot is the second star of this movie after Ben Affleck's success! She is amazing, hot and strong! However, I prefer daily Wonder Woman who is more interesting than most of the 'Bond girls' in James Bond flicks! The relationship between her and Bruce Wayne is very similar with classic spy movies. She was convincing as the character that made me want more of her in the movie.The long first half of the movie is slow paced, then things hot up and then the movie speeds up like crazy! If you ask me, I prefer the slow first half over the action packed second half, especially because of some terrible CGI moments, clichés and rushed feeling. And the suddenly revealing humor between characters change the mood of the film in a bad way. There are two parts in the movie which you can watch with awe. The dream sequence of Bruce Wayne is creepy, surreal and the second best part of the movie, but the best part of the movie is definitely the hand to hand combat sequence following an attack.Henry Cavill as Superman is always perfect and he is the same here, nothing less and nothing more, but in this cold and soulless film, we cannot feel anything about a character in a real way. By the way, I want to mention again that Ben Affleck really delivers as Bruce Wayne and Batman and even if my personal favorite is Michael Keaton, I loved how Affleck portrays the character and having no problem with it. As a Batman fan, also my favorite super hero, I appreciate Mr. Affleck. What this film succeeds in is to question what is wrong and what is right, to question the ethics of being a superhero, to question the decision of super heroes and reactions against them by the public and the government. By the way, the most interesting and intense character in the whole movie was Holly Hunter's Senator Finch! Lovely and beautiful actress Holly Hunter is remarkable in this story. And, Jeremy Irons was cool as Alfred!",3,6,12,15 May 2016
Casino Royale," As an action or thriller, disappointing, even if it is a reconstruction in Bond series
","Yes, Casino Royale is not like any other Bond movie, but unfortunately some habits are still kept and as an action thriller or a movie, it is not a breakthrough or an epochal movie and personally, to me it was not a real good movie. In James Bond movies, many things are the same, there are some inevitable clichés, otherwise it does not become a Bond movie. Bond falls in love with several attractive women, if the spy is a woman, she turns into good, because she loves Bond too. There are three kind of women in Bond movies, the women who fall in love with James Bond when they meet him, the women who are spies, but after a while, change their side and the women who pretend to fall in love with James Bond, but even they don't harm him, because probably they fall in love with him. As a result, it means that every woman falls in love with James Bond which I already get bored and find totally unrealistic. In recent years, some audiences had woken up probably or the filmmakers had changed their mind that is unbelievable but possible. Then Casino Royale was made. It was in IMDb Top 250 and still it is there, because many people thought that it was a revolution. James Bond is a blond, unknown actor. There is Eva Green. When I saw the movie, yes there were more changes besides the actors and actresses, for example, James Bond was not a hero in the movie, the lavatory scene or the trick of Bond at the end of the pursuit takes place in the beginning was showing that. However, although, it seems a conscious, revisionist film, there are still some unforgettable clichés. Is there a woman falls in love with James Bond,yes. Even if Eva Green's character is different (more realistic) than previous Bond girls. Yes, as some people say too, she is not a woman who falls in love with Bond instantly and to me she is not like a belonging of James Bond tails after him. However, even if she seems a feminist, she has a sexual relationship with Bond at last and it means that Bond attracts her. By the way, there is another woman in the movie either who falls in love with Bond and makes sex with him. Then, where is the difference? I don't like Martin Campbell because of Mask of Zorro especially. In Casino Royale, Campbell is pretty good. The movie is pretty stylish, visually well, a well made work. The first action scene was so fast-moving and very energetic. The gambling scenes are elegant. However, no gimmick in the rest.",5,0,2,22 December 2009
X2: X-Men United," The comic book tone of the first film is missing here, but still a great, powerful movie
","I watched the movie for the first time at theater in 2003 and disappointed. It seemed me less entertaining and pretty slow paced. However, later, I took its DVD and watched it again, completely changed my mind. X-2 is as entertaining as the first one and again with great, amazing action scenes. Plus, the movie is deeper, more powerful than the first one owing to the brilliant script. The opening sequence of the movie is one of the best opening sequences so far. However, one of my favorite parts, may be favorite part is the assault sequence. It is spectacular, not showy. Especially editing and sound editing are great and to me it deserves to be included in cinema anthology, at least action cinema anthology. I like Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, but whatever he does, he cannot be as tough as the original character, in other words, he does not look like a threat. Sorry, but Brian Cox's William Stryker is much more better than Danny Huston's William Stryker. The man with the wheel chair must be one of the most important characters of X-Men myth, but I did not know this character, still I don't know, I haven't searched, so I cold not understand that part exactly. The cell of Magneto recalls the cell of Hannibal Lecter obviously. The plan of him and Mystique was probably one of the most smart plans in cinema. As for the X-jet sequence, like the assault part, it deserves to be included in the bests. Except Behind Enemy Lines, the greatest 'jet' sequence is here. Spectacular and especially sound editing is great. Twister moments were unbelievable. Wolverine Deathstrike fight is very harsh (as I know, because of the complaints of the fans, Singer made fights more tough) but a bit exaggerating and showy. However, there are more amazing scenes, more action and sub stories in the movie.",9,1,2,7 February 2010
Kagemusha," Impressive in many aspects, but some flaws left me disappointed
","Firstly, let me say that I didn't watch this movie for action or watching battle scenes. Visually mesmerizing, acting is powerful, story editing is exceptional, but Kagemusha bugged me because of its unsatisfying battle scenes owing to weird editing and vision which contradicts the big master Kurosawa. What I see is people for example critics don't accept this, a kind of pseudo intellectualism? I am respectful for Kurosawa, but I can't tell you lie. I didn't like this movie. It might sound intolerable to them, but the battle scenes ruined the movie for me, otherwise, it would have been one of the best Kurosawa movies like Ran. I have never become one of the people who see all Kurosawa movies as masterpiece, give 10 out of 10 to all of those. As for Kagemusha, we know that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas supported Kurosawa financially for this project. Kurosawa shows very long preparation scenes for the battle, we see the battlefield in detail, great visuals, he prepares us for the battle, we wait, wait, wait, but then nothing happens, to be more precise the war takes place, but we can't see it exactly. Artificial lights, fog, it is like a theater, great images, but we are left unsatisfied and somehow, this becomes frustrating as the film goes. Later, again warriors prepare for another battle, we prepare us for the big battle, we wait, wait, then the same thing happens. There is an introduction, no development, but conclusion. Especially the last war is unbelievable. I just can't get it. Why? However, his fans interpret this as Kurosawa preferred that way which is great! Sorry, but this must be pseudo intellectualism. And there is another odd fact, as said, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas supported him financially, but it looks like they didn't? A film critic wrote that Kagemusha gives us a lecture about how war scenes should be made. Well, it is funny, I think the exact opposite! Sorry, but clearly this is a conscious manipulation. Kagemusha is a must see and a great drama, but it is not impressive like some other Kurosawa movies.",5,4,10,9 December 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," If you ask me, unreachable
","Yes, some movies are overrated, some of them are very overrated, some of them are in IMDb Top 250, some of them are not, but I try to say that people give The Lord of the Rings low ratings or don't agree that it is the greatest fantasy epic of all time, or at least one of them, so that they believe that it is overrated. The movies in the list are discussed above only is it overrated or not, does it deserve its rating, or it does not? If the movie had not been in the list, I am sure that they would not hated it like that. No fantasy movie can surpass The Lord of the Rings, if you ask me, this is the fact, not just I believe. I have learned that some people hated Elijah Wood's performance, but to me, his acting was outstanding. By the way, Hugo Weaving played in two of the most popular and phenomenal trilogies, The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings. There are some scenes that are enough to make the film a modern classic. The scene that Gandalf and Pippin go to Minas Tirith. I would not get bored, even if I watched this scene one hundred times. I don't know why, but I see this scene as a sharp response to the people who hate The Lord of the Rings and who hate fantasy movies. It is not showy, but spectacular. The scene which the beacons are lighted, the astonishing spider scene which the spider turns Frodo into a cocoon, the scene King Theoden and his thousands of warriors leave the forest. Jackson shoots such kind of scenes including battle scenes by panoramic angles that makes the movie more spectacular. There are a lot of dazzling images throughout the movie. The Lord of the Rings's battle scenes are may be the greatest. As you know, the longest and the grandest battle sequences are in The LOTR movies, one of them is in the second movie and the other one is in this movie. As said, especially camera angles are dazzling, but on all counts, it is extremely entertaining and spectacular, despite sometimes it is pretty exaggerating. The scene which Denethor looks down and sees the army is the beginning. Later, we see almost the whole army and I just love that. In an interview, for Jackson's battle scenes, Viggo Mortensen was saying that Jackson likes crowded battle scenes, more crowded battle scenes are, better for Jackson it is. That sounds great. The scene which King Theoden and his warriors come is one of the most dazzling parts in the battle. I don't know how many times I watch these battle scenes. There is also an image which we see the half of Sauron's army and Theoden's army while they ride horse to them, every time, I wish I framed that image and hanged on my wall. Not finished. Mammoths. The scenes they appear are great too, CGI is almost perfect. For the first time, I had disappointed with the warriors on the mammoths, because it was seeming that they are not belong to there, that world, but then liked it very much when watched it on DVD months after. It is exotic. By the way, the scene which they throw a marble piece to the commander who recalls The Elephant Man was not the same in DVD. In DVD, he spits on it which is ridiculous, but at theater, he said ''you have missed.'' which is great. I don't know why Jackson changed it. By the way, the movie is problematic, or should I say exaggerating about battle between people and animals. He did this in King Kong either. I mean that for example, the battle between Sam and creature, the battle between Eowyn and the mammoth (she overcomes it by four sword blows, it crouches by four sword blows!! How absurd it is, it is like what is the point then, if a female human being who did not fight before can overcome a mammoth and in an impossible (so unrealistic) way?) and the battle between her and the dragon. Gollum gives us a lesson. Bad people may seem aggrieved, downtrodden, pitiful, briefly innocent, we should not believe them blindly. Unbelievably, there is one more big battle and Jackson does not pass it quickly or makes it scratchy by saying I already showed them the longest battle of all time. Again, we see dazzling images, In terms of content and style both, the volcano scenes are powerful. A guy left the theater ten minutes to finish. I just can't do such a thing and was it boring? You watch it for three hours and cannot wait 10 minutes more? A critic also did it, he said on TV. By the way, I would wonder the extended edition, probably it is better than even this.

Heat," The film of the bests
","Heat is one of the best movies of all time and Michael Mann's best movie to me. Also one of the best crime thrillers with the best bank robbery sequence. This is a film that Al Pacino is in the cast. He is not a supporter actor. His character is also suits him a lot. And there is Robert De Niro too. He is not a supporter actor like Pacino. And this movie is three hours. However, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are not father-in-laws and Heat is not a comedy. Pacino plays a cop and De Niro plays a thief. Pacino says I will catch you and De Niro says, do it if you can. While reading the cast for the first time, I said this is enough, OK. but it continued. One more very good (and to me very liked) actor or actress and one more and one more. This is a crime, action movie, but a deep one, not a shallow work at all. Heat shows almost every character's personal lives, working lives and problems, but even one scene is not uninteresting. Some scenes are so still, but I like it. Stylish. To me Heat is the most stylish Michael Mann movie with The Insider. I like the movies which show us the city or show us the places that Scorsese never does. There are almost two action scenes, one of them is very short, but very exciting. The other is one of the longest and realistic clashes of all times, probably the most loudest action scene, too. You have a headache, this is inevitable and the gun sounds ring inside your brain, your ears ring. However, I don't care about it so much. I love watching Al Pacino while he runs, Mann turns the music down. It must deserve to be put in the action cinema anthology. Almost all the people saw the film talk about the scene which Pacino and De Niro talk face to face, as you know, Heat is the first film that De Niro and Pacino were in the same scene. Honestly, I am not interested in it so much, I mean I don't love Heat so that there is this scene, it is a historical moment in cinema may be, but cut this scene, the film is still excellent. A very powerful and stylish crime epic.",10,5,10,19 December 2009
300," Action and entertainment are 10/10, content and script are 0/10
","When I watched the trailer 0f 300, I was shocked and thought that it would be an unusual, unconventional and in a good way weird movie. In fact, yes, 300 is very different from many epic movies, but only in terms of action and a few shots. Almost the whole movie consists of perpetual action scenes which is great. To me, this is a very important step for action cinema. Alexander the Great, Troy, Kingdom of Heaven, Gladiator, there are much more action in 300 than all these movies. However, the problem that makes 300 very very disappointing is the script. There are some bizarre details firstly. For instance, blood of Persians spills in pitch-black. I think that may be, Zack Snyder had not wanted to make the movie censored or the movie tries to mention that Persians are evil by nature! It is clearly seen that the color of blood of the Persians in the movie is black! Whatever the reason, it looks annoying. In addition, the visual effects, especially blood effects would have been realistic, but in some parts, the movie looks like a computer game, visual effects are shockingly superficial and I cannot see any reason for it. Why? How could they release the movie like that? Spartans slaughter Persians while they are half dead, lying on the ground, screams, begging. While they laugh, a Persian dies. In another scene, they shout no mercy, but when a Spartan is killed, that alters matters, we see some tragic moments, the father crocks up and the narrator talks poetically. It is extremely clear that Snyder discriminates against the other side. Also it causes that we cannot like Spartans. Personally, I hated them at times and especially Stelios. The Spartans get angry unduly that is OK, but it seems that they slaughter Persians with great pleasure, not because they have to do that. By the way, Persians do nothing like killing or raping the public. I confess that I could not feel any compassion or feel sorry for any Spartan, instead thought the opposite at times, after all those that happen. Another issue, Xerxes has a huge army, but The Spartans give them hell without any real effort or pain. The script writers would have overcome this big absurdity by thinking a little bit! For example, I have a solution. Because of his extreme arrogance, Xerxes does not send all his army. He releases small groups to kill The Spartans, so the three hundred men rout them every time. Then... Something like that. The immortals. I won't ask the question, what does a mortal immortal mean? However, let's suppose that Xerxes might call his elite warriors as the immortals because of his haughtiness. Although, they look very interesting and also crawly, when they begin to fight, we see that they are pretty weak and passive. In the fifth minute of the war, they call help. In fact, all the Persians in the movie are like that. They are represented as very weak, untalented and silly warriors. According to the movie, they do not know exactly how to fight, one Spartan gets on the war area and kills approximately ten Persians at the same time! 300 is a very entertaining movie and very stylish. Some characters are very interesting; The Immortals, Xerxes, the monsters, animals. I watched the war scenes tons of times, each time enjoyed, especially the battle with the immortals, it is great, the arrow moments, the first clash at the hot gates etc. but the rest is too hard to bear at.",5,1,1,25 November 2009
The Thin Red Line," The other of the two war movie masterpieces in 1998
","I'll start with a confess about the director. I couldn't like every Terrence Malick film as a moviegoer. I've seen all of those. Does this make me a fan of the director? I don't know. Let me start with his debut Badlands. I couldn't like that movie, may be my expectations were different or above. I had expected a stunning, devastating film with a powerful social background, but I couldn't find it. I know it may sound too personal for you, but I believe that art itself is subjective. I couldn't like Days of Heaven either unfortunately. I decided to watch that film because of its interesting and original story, but unfortunately it was a style over substance film. The cinematography was beautiful may be yes, the atmosphere, the story telling were poetic, yes, but there was not a powerful story, even a story. The New World is one of my all time favorite adventure movies, because it was different. Tree of Life was the same, I was mesmerized by that movie, it was quintessential cinema, pure art, but with a powerful father and son or family story as the background of the work. I was stunned by the story. As for his last film so far, To The Wonder, I didn't like it unfortunately, because I believed that the master was repeating himself in terms of themes and the way of story telling. Again, there was no story, in addition, this time no emotion, nothing but peace, nothing but beautiful images, nothing but a narrator. Sometimes, it feels like empty. The Thin Red Line is personally Terrence Malick's greatest film by far, it is his masterpiece. Yes, there is a narrator, too in the film, yes the style is the same style, yes, the way of story telling is poetic like the director's other movies, but there is something else in this movie, something magical which I don't know. As a war movie, there is a powerful and importantly dramatic story. The movie doesn't turn war into a pretentious, pseudo intellectual slide show, No, No, it gives us one of the most powerful portrait about war! It was also realistic and deep. The cast is incredible and it was a real joy for me to see those great actors one after another even if their screen time are mostly short. The dramatic structure of the film is not very different from Saving Private Ryan, I mean, there is no style over substance problem in The Thin Red Line. Visually, the movie was mesmerizing, technically it was astonishing. The cinematography, the technical craft were just award worthy. However, the film doesn't show war something beautiful or poetic, it is the way of story telling of the director, two things are different. If the movie looks beautiful, that doesn't mean that the movie says war is an art. Saving Private Ryan was criticized for similar reasons. Saving Private Ryan was real a stylish film, a director's film, also it was a blockbuster, an entertainment film, an action film, but for me both films are masterpieces. Both movies are the zenith of the cinema. I didn't find The Thin Red Line dull as I didn't find Saving Private Ryan too action packed or entertaining in a bad way. Briefly it is like Scarface. De Palma's Scarface was a masterpiece, but that doesn't mean that 1932 Scarface wasn't a masterpiece. The Thin Red Line is also a humanist film which is another good point. If I don't talk about the editing of the film, I will be unfair to it. The editing of the film is genius, brilliant, it was an unique experience for me cinematically and it one more time proves how a genius filmmaker Terrence Malick is. This is not images with a narrator accompany you throughout which I don't like particularly. Thus, The Thin Red Line is a cinematically very powerful film with a powerful story, powerful humanist messages and powerful acting by the dream team-like cast, also a heart-wrenching human drama.",10,4,7,7 July 2013
Fantastic Four," I was not disappointed, may be because I hadn't any particular expectation
","Many people, or let's say the haters complain that Fantastic Four was too non serious, it was not dark at all and it was not entertaining, probably because of that. I can throw out that the second part is not true and also the first part is not a flaw. Why? Because Fantastic Four is not a dark comic book anyway like Batman for example and it is not too non serious (so unbearable) as they say. Yes, there are a lot of humor, funny scenes, funny dialogs, but firstly it is balanced (believe me, it is much more balanced than Peter Parker's dance in Spider Man 3!) Secondly it is fun and thirdly there are enough, satisfactory action that answers the humor. Fantastic Four is better than, even much better than some other super hero movies such as Superman Returns, Daredevil, Iron Man 2 or The Incredible Hulk. I will tell you something weird. For example, Iron Man 2 was very disappointing to me, because there was much humor, but less action, I got bored at times. As for Fantastic Four, it is director is a comedy-origin director, Tim Story you know and yes Fantastic Four includes lots of humor, lots of funny stuff as I said, but somehow it makes you satisfied on action, excitement and entertainment. May be the best side of the movie was that the director focuses on the changes of the four very much, the process that they explore their power, the use of these powers, at times, especially Johnny uses his powers just for fun. I so enjoyed these parts, because simply it was entertaining that to watch those ordinary people while they use their special abilities after gaining and of course this is the good side of it, their abilities make their life easier. The characters were likable, I liked especially Redd and Johnny. And these four people has four different personalities. Reed is a well behaved, polite guy, Johnny (in fact the deepest character in the movie) is womanizer, show-off, narcissist, fame hungry, a teaser etc. Ben Grimm is a helpful, a bit soft hearted and at the same time rude guy and knows his responsibilities, even if the decision he takes is too confusing. As for Sue, she has not any remarkable characteristic, but no problem. And Victor Doom. He is a playboy, a power driven man and he is the fifth, the one who becomes bad. The movie shows us if people who have these personalities gain special powers, what would they do?, who would they become? Step by step! Just because of this, the movie cannot be bad! Iron Man 2 had much amusement, but too less action, why people did not complain and they rated it high? When it comes Fantastic Four, they say just simply bad, because it is so amusing? Therefore, I see Fantastic Four as a kind of scapegoat. I was satisfied with action, there is not lots of action in Fantastic Four let's be honest, but it was satisfactory and at the same time, the movie was not boring at all, of course it changes according to everybody but. Returning to action, it has not lots of as said, not great, but really entertaining, especially the rocket scene was cool.",6,1,2,29 May 2010
John Wick: Chapter 2," The first movie was better
","The first John Wick was a flourishing, surprisingly well done and solid action film which was even better than people'd expected. The main character were cool thanks to great Keanu Reeves. The story was mysterious, asking questions. The film was stylistic in a natural manner and had lots of action, a real gem of a film! This second John Wick tries to explain everything like what is what and who is who? A big mistake! The director tries to deepen the story and enriches his universe by adding some new characters and their stories, but it slows the story down. In other words, it makes the story heavier. The first movie was all about questions, this movie is about intrigues like an episode of a serial TV action. The first film was a sincere letter to action genre, but this second installment feels like a pseudo artistic work. The flashy climactic scene frankly proves that. This movie tries to look 'elegant', but it falls too short. The action is great at times, but even if it is also an action packed film, it feels like boring if we think about the pace of the first movie. I believe that the best scene of the movie is when John Wick (Keanu Reeves) meets Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) and you start to cry! Maybe, John Wick 2 is a more dignified film than the other in some ways, but all those explanations and narrative make it a less entertaining experience, probably because this is an intermediate chapter between the first and the probable third film. By the way, it is sad that Ruby Rose is wasted here. We can never see that expected breaking point happening. We love Keanu Reeves and he is great here again and the action scenes are professional and classy, but the movie is somehow dreary. I hope, in the next chapter, the director can work things out.",6,2,6,15 April 2017
Braveheart," Forget about the chaos of the haters for a minute, this is a great epic!
","Braveheart is a great battle epic, but if you one of those people who are almost obsessed with historical inaccuracies in movies, then probably you are not impressed, positively affected and entertained by this movie like us. As for Mel Gibson, it is known that there are a lot of enemies of him, there are a lot of people who hate him. Why? It is because he is a deep catholic and you are not? It is because he did a speech about Jewish people, when he was drunk? or it is because you think that the movie is one sided, it shows some English people as evil? or it is because you are a nerd who doesn't forgive any movie, if it has historical inaccuracies? As for being one sided or racist, should we toss movies out, if they are one sided, even if those movies are cinematically and artistically great? This is the key question. If so, for example Saving Private Ryan is an awful movie either, right? By the way since I am not English, I can't know what you feel, so about this point, English people might be right. If I had been English, may be I would have hated the movie too, but in these circumstances, as an historical epic, as a war movie for me, it is one of greatest movies of all time and the best historical action ever! You may dislike this movie, I can understand that, but trolling is not my cup of tea and I find it unfair, so what really disturbs me is those kind of ugly and nasty stuff, written by people. I mean that some say that acting was awful, direction was awful etc. I like Mel Gibson, he is one of my favorite actors / directors. I believe that in this movie, he gave one of his best performances, may be the best. William Wallace. With his long hairs, blue eyes, with his mimics, stares, hard looks... His face while looking at the man in their first insurgency, his face while looking at the blonde child. These are great moments in the history of cinema. The final was one of the most 'heavy' and heartbreaking finals ever made (of course not for the people who hate him) I know that the haters watch that with pleasure. Direction, Mel Gibson, Mel Gibson's interesting William Wallace interpretation, cinematography, its dramatic impact and because of the battle scenes, I love Braveheart. Some people claim that Gibson imitated Kurosawa's Ran, sorry but does Ran has even a real battle sequence? And I know that it will be very assertive, but in terms of direction, mise-en-scene in battle scenes, Gibson is much better than even the master Kurosawa. If we don't count The Lord of the Rings, you cannot find better battle scenes in the history of cinema! The most well planned, the most detailed and the most epic battle scenes are here. To me, Saving Private Ryan is the greatest of the all war movies and Braveheart is the greatest one of the all battle epics.",10,0,5,7 January 2010
True Romance," What is so great about this movie?
","Almost many people including critics (probably critics's favorite) agree that True Romance is the best Tony Scott film, a masterpiece. However, the problem is what is so great about the movie? Direction? Sorry, but we are not talking about Enemy of the State here. Acting? I don't think so, no Oscar worthy performance here. The cinematography? Nothing special. Story? A guy and a girl meet and get troubled. That's the story. This is not a great road movie or lovers on the run movie, there is nothing impressive or even artistic like Quentin Tarantino movies itself. There is not any remarkable scene to mention with enthusiasm. I don't know this adulation is because Tarantino wrote the script or not, but this is the case. It was like one of the TV movies with a dreamy cast. Years years before I bought it from a newsstand, because saw the list of the cast on the cover and saw Tony Scott. However, not only it was only a huge disappointment, but also I did not enjoy at all. Some people say look! they watch a fighting movie in the film, a reference for martial art movies. That's funny, because I love martial art movies and I would prefer to watch any martial art movie instead of watching this again. True Romance has a dreamy cast probably you will never see once again in another movie. I could not pull myself together for a long time, after had seen the cast as mentioned, but it does not save the day. By the way, honestly, I couldn't see some of them, for example I couldn't see Brad Pitt against my full attention. Thus, this is not a 'cast driven' movie at all. Tony Scott's style (I mean Tony Scott in his early days like Top Gun or Enemy of the State) is missing in this movie. True Romance is not a stylish movie, it is just ordinary in terms of direction. And as I see, especially critics don't like Top Gun, but love True Romance. True Romance recalls One Night at McCool's in the final part. That part was a little bit sloppy, but at least entertaining. Tony Scott shot such a scene? Hard to believe. Later, I exchanged the movie with another one after watching. I know that it sounds intolerable for the fans of the movie, but it sounds intolerable for me either, when reading that they watch the movie again and again with great pleasure.",3,11,30,5 December 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," It is not as remarkable as the original trilogy, but amazingly perfect as a separate Mad Max movie
","Yes, this new Mad Max is a non stop chase movie without a real story which some people complained about, but this doesn't mean that the movie is disappointing. The other way round, I really felt a film after years! What the action movies are lack of these days is heart and soul and this movie got it right! Most of the new generation blockbusters have lots of action, digital effects, high technology, maybe magnificence but without emotion and spark. Hollow movies... This Mad Max movie is not a bluster movie. Somehow, there is a drama in the background. There are chases, but not for the sake of it. We care about the characters. As for Mad Max criticism as he was not the hero or star of the movie, it didn't frustrate me. While I was watching The Dark Knight Rises, I was always asking 'where is the Batman? where is the Batman? because Batman was like a cameo in the movie. Mad Max is different. Max is there, waiting for you! I mean it works here somehow. Everything works well in the movie. The story is (if there is one) is plain and simple, but somehow it works perfectly. Story development is not powerful, but the movie doesn't need that. Maybe, only flaw of the movie is the underestimated villains. The master director George Miller doesn't do justice to the great villains of the film. A great villain is another thing that new generation action movies are lack of. We rarely see the main bad guy and his henchmen, especially his muscled son are not effectively used in the film. The villains are intimidating and haunting but mostly, they were more like pawns in the desert. However, this is not a big problem. Everything is done as it should be. As for Tom Hardy, as a fan of him, it was a pleasure to watch him again, but I couldn't see him as Max, he was more like the son of the mad max than our old, original character. However, I liked him as a character. Mel Gibson could have joined the cast as a cameo, but it seems that he didn't want to do it. What about Furiosa hype that has shaken the world? Well, Charlize Theron was remarkable, but don't expect the most legendary character of all time in movie history or something! Not unforgettable, but a very gritty character portrait. The girls were charming and their story was sad, but maybe their surreal existence was out of place in the movie. The opening scene of the movie was disappointing for me, but then the movie turned into a breathtaking, non stop journey, an amazing freak show with fuel, machines, fire and blood! The action scenes were an example of incredible technical craftsmanship. I just want to congratulate all the cast and crew for this hard work. In comparison with the original, old trilogy, a powerful story with a development is missing here, but as a separate film, my favorite film of the year so far. There is tears, there is fun, there is fuel and there is blood!",10,7,17,14 June 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," A brutal film with an important subject matter, but also it feels like a dated war melodrama with poor dramatization
","Hacksaw Ridge shows the brutal and sorrowful side of war, it is a must see especially for the audience who loves the genre, but it falls too short, because it works like a dated war melodrama with some brutal and bloody battle scenes which has only shocking effect. Hacksaw Ridge is like 'We Were Soldiers' with a better quality, better theme and higher budget. I believe that a war movie doesn't have to be 'anti- war' to be great. For example, Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down is not an anti war movie, it is a military operation movie, but I think it is a masterpiece. I have the same opinions for some other movies such as Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates and I enjoyed movies such as Fury, The Lone Survivor (flawed, but a solid survival action) However, Hacksaw Ridge fails too short.I didn't find the first half compelling or a great story introduction. You don't care about the main protagonist as you did for William Wallace for example. Honestly, I didn't enjoy what most people did for the prologue, so I did find it little boring. Maybe, because I'd expected a movie like The Fury. An intense war drama with some great moments and set pieces with an interesting character gallery. Many people praise what Gibson did for the movie, especially visual effects, set pieces and battle scenes, but I think it was not point of the film, also it was not that impressive or special. There is not such a rule that more brutal it becomes, greater it gets. I was not at the edge of my seat during the battle scenes most of the time as I didn't really feel the despair of the characters and their dilemmas when they face with it. For example, in the movie Papillon, you feel every kind of pain as you are there with them or you are one of them! so the storytelling in this movie was not powerful enough to carry its subject matter. Many people praise Andrew Garfield, I am in the minority again, but I think it was a mistake. He has some haters maybe, but I think Shia Labeouf would play the character better. Maybe, Garfield has a talent of his own, but he is not that gifted to play such a character. The real star of the movie was Vince Vaughn as the commander, nobody else!The battle scenes has some shocking effects, but no more than that. The dramatic tension and humanism factor are poor. Some parts in the army before going to war are not realistic as it should be. As for Mel Gibson, I don't care about what other people think or say about him, but I am a fan of his movies. He is one of the best stars of his time like Bruce Willis. Hacksaw Ridge is his weakest movie so far as director. Maybe, he tried to make an old school and romantic, also gritty war drama, but there was nothing new and the movie itself was dated. This is not a subject which I am sensitive in movies, but the depiction and portrayal of Japans in this movie made me little annoyed. In the movie, Japanese soldiers are like evil forces, different from Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima. Why? What makes this film worthy is its subject and conflict. Hacksaw Ridge lacks the tragic nature of Braveheart. Mel Gibson's masterpiece is still Braveheart. If you look for an epic anti war movie like Platoon, you'll get disappointed. If you look for a stylish war/action drama like Fury, you'll get disappointed. If you look for an artistic journey like The Hurt Locker, you'll be disappointed anyway. However, what you want is to learn about history by watching the revival of the events or watching a technically good war drama with some matters, this film is a good choice for you.",5,9,19,10 December 2016
Gladiator," A milestone historical epic which has been overlooked in time
","Despite, I've been affected negatively by comments like it is overrated or it was not that great in the past, after thinking about it once more, I conclude that Gladiator is a great film. The opening sequence of the movie was remarkable, the bird, Russell Crowe's hands over wheat and the action as a preparation for us. The movie is a first rate historical epic with the help of Ridley Scott the master's craftsmanship in technical aspects such as editing, art direction and the spectacular action scenes. Also great entertainment. The musics are of course fiery and enthusing. The movie is may be too showy at times, but isn't this natural for a movie about gladiator games? It is an effective and impressive film. Russell Crowe is the star of the movie, literally too! He steals the show, but Phoenix is great, a great villain, too. He is unforgettable like the movie itself. Also, you can see the actor who played Conan in the TV series (at that time, I was almost a child) In terms of everything, but especially story telling, Gladiator is much much better than his latter film Kingdom of Heaven. The forest scene at the beginnings requires a little too much suspension of disbelief, but in the end, it was necessary, because there was no other way to do that. The story might be cliché for some, but I think, it was powerful and solid to keep the film throughout. The story editing is a real epic! It is one of the main reasons that make the film a masterpiece in the genre. When I watched the movie for the first time at theater, I was seriously disappointed when I saw the combat area, but then realized that it wasn't The Colosseum when the real movie starts! The CGI was perfect at that time, as I know, it was one of the movies that an improved technology was used for the first time. 'Are you not entertained?' scene is thought- provoking. The first battle in The Colosseum is worthy of cinema anthology. An unforgettable, iconic, spectacular sequence by Scott! I have no idea how many times I have seen this sequence! As action, may be it is the one of the movie. The craft in this sequence is breathtaking. The tiger sequence is another iconic, unforgettable and well executed part of the movie. In the year, 2000, at theater, I found that masked guy very interesting. The climax of the film was not as climactic as I'd expected, what can I say, I found it a little bit low key, but still a 'deserving' final. Gladiator is one of the greatest historical epics so far.",10,1,2,28 June 2013
The Social Network," A visual information streaming without any real cinematic, artistic and emotional effect
","It is surprising and quite shocking for me that most people appreciated the work David Fincher had done, especially the style, the approach, the pacing, the editing etc. The Social Network is a 'cinema free' and 'art free' movie, also I didn't consider it as an entertainment film. The Social Network has no heart and soul, it is almost impossible to feel anything about anything happening on the screen including the characters. I didn't hate the main character as I didn't like him either, but the problem is not the character. I can't see any artistic touch or cinema feeling in this movie. It was like 'just story and dialogs nothing else, so I found the movie 'mechanic'. See Fincher's other works, especially his early period, there is a huge gap between those and The Social Network. As for entertainment, personally I was not entertained, but also I don't think that this movie intended to be entertainment. If it was, then it is a failure! It was impossible to be entertained for me because of the pacing of the movie and probably it was literally the most exhausting movie I have ever seen in my life. Not only the characters speak too fast, but also the pacing of the film. This editing style, course of events with no break is something I really hate as a moviegoer like that shaky cam and if you ask me it doesn't add brilliance to the movie. The another main problem of the movie is lacking of any message, depth or social commentary. I had expected a thought provoking film and I can easily say that Benjamin Button includes much more themes, messages and comments on life than The Social Network. The Social Network has no background, think about a movie without a background, just the story, the characters are there and dialogs. This is such a movie, so the movie doesn't let you feel anything about anything. I saw a lot of biographical movies, but haven't seen such a film before. If things such as 'cinematic experience', 'dramatic structure', heart and soul, character and story depth etc. mean a lot for you like me, then prepare yourself for a poor and very exhausting cinematic journey. Unfortunately, some great directors like some great actors lose their talent, even if not, they don't make great movies as they did in the past such as Brian De Palma, Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, Tim Burton etc. and as I a big Fincher fan, it is too hard and painful for me to say this, but Fincher is now one of those names either. Considering David Fincher's career, it is like before Panic Room and after Panic Room. By the way, I really liked and enjoyed Panic Room, but it was the transition movie of Fincher. Personally I prefer the period before Panic Room, because I wasn't that impressed by the movies he did after Panic Room. In this movie, if Fincher did something brilliant, I couldn't see what it is. A 'smart' movie for me is something like 500 Days of Summer. If in the history of cinema, there is any other movie similar with The Social Network, in terms of style with real pacing problems, that could be Syriana, but even Syriana was a more important film than this if you ask me, despite I wasn't impressed by that movie either. I would have wanted to see scenes from life, scenes from Facebook users' lives, some social and psychological comments and the most important relationships! I don't know, but there is one thing I am sure about that which is it would be very interesting and useful to see such a film for every of us. Then what is the point of this film? Just to give us some information? If so, this is not 'cinema'. The Social Network is a visual information streaming, just that.",1,11,19,26 August 2013
Macbeth," Pretentiously poetic, lacking depth and cold like ice!
","This new adaptation of Macbeth got excited me weeks before and when I saw the cast, Fassbender and Cotillard, I got excited even more! Because they are just great and I am a fan of both. However, from the first minute, the film couldn't catch the viewer's attention fully, because it lacks emotion, depth and thrill. This is not an exactly drama film, because there is not much of it. You can see this even in the first battle of the film. A pretentious way of film making just to be seen poetic and artistic. The movie visually looks beautiful at some moments, but those images serve nothing. Fassbender and Cotillard make us surprised by their 'low key' performances, so please don't expect any kind of tour-de-force acting from them. If you do, you are seriously disappointed. In the film, there is no character depth at all and the dramatization of the events was totally ineffective. For example, a character is portrayed evil, but you have no idea or clue why he or she is evil? A character is portrayed brave, but you have no idea, why he is such a brave man? It is mostly because there is no tension which should increase gradually like Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece Throne of Blood. As expected, this is not a 'war' film. If you expect a Kingdom of Heaven like film, then you are seriously disappointed. I had not any problem with unusual monologues/dialogs in the film, but some may find it hard to follow. It doesn't ruin the reality of the film which is a success. Especially, in the second act, the film becomes more pretentious with the over the top and 'poetic' visuals and just leaves you with no emotion. This new Macbeth is a film lacking heart and soul in the material caused by its pompous narration.",1,23,43,19 December 2015
The Bourne Supremacy," Is this real?
","Bourne Supremacy is one of my all time favorite action thriller movies. I had not expected that, I had supposed that it is just another action thriller, watch and enjoy, no more, but it was beyond great. The direction is not only very stylish, but sterile that makes the movie peculiar in a good way. The editing and camera usage are peculiar too, despite some people seriously complain about it, especially when it comes the car chase scenes. In the movie, there is not any cliché also, it shows that the director is a 'conscious' director, I watched some of his interviews and comments on the film and extremely impressed. The fight scene which takes place in Munich is very realistic and deliberately directed. I learned that the explosion was real that's why it was fresh and amazing. The movie is very consistent on all counts or should I say solid? As for clichés, Bourne does not make love with the women who he meets which is a revolution in action thriller movies. Women don't fall in love with him or he does not allure women. There is a scene that takes place in a railway station, it recalls The Jackal, this scene was impressive, it was jaw dropping and pretty stark. Karl Urban's character is somehow different from other usual villains, realistic? And yes, the car chase. One of the greatest car chases of all time. Some people seriously complain about the shaky camera in such scenes, but it was not annoying at all to me, if you say Transformers, yes it was, but I loved this one. Some shots are extremely short, shaky camera, but brilliant. Also this is one of the longest car chases ever made like Ronin. Bourne Supremacy is my favorite movie in the series by far.",10,2,4,24 January 2010
Jurassic Park," A tour in the park
","To me, Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all time, just one movie is enough to call him a master; Saving Private Ryan. Jurassic Park was a very big disappointment to me, because I had expected much more from Spielberg, instead, it was a solid and at times very slow paced and mediocre adventure film. The first half was like an interminable introduction, it was too slow paced, I expected some action or fun, had none of them. Then I ask, where is fun in the first half? I had expected a perfectly directed, also perfectly written action, suspense, suspense or a gribbing story, but it was uninteresting till the second half. The only successful thing in the movie is visual effects, as you know, it was a revolutionary experience in cinema in that year. I appreciate, but as an adventure or action, I think that the movie is just OK. In the second half, I had expected that there would be a battle between the family and the dinosaurs. A do-or-die fight, but couldn't find anything spectacular. JP is a movie which when you are shocked by electric wire, nothing happens, but your hair bristles! Jurassic Park is like a tour in the park rather than being trapped feeling. When the family arrives Jurassic Park, we see dazzling dinosaurs, CGI is flawless and the famous car scene takes place which was impressive, but no more than that.",2,6,32,24 December 2009
The Martian," Mars commercial?
","As a real Ridley Scott fan, I hate to say this, but the director has lost his spark and talent in recent years. In other words, do you remember 'A Ridley Scott movie'. You can't feel this anymore which is sad for fans like me. The Martian is another disappointment, so if you don't know about the fact that this film was shot by Scott before watching the film, you cannot understand until the end credits. As for the problem of the movie, the movie is not 'Cast Away on space'. I wish it was, but it is not. Why? Because there is no suspense, no mystery and no horror. The film ignores the psychological nature of the character and he doesn't face with any real challenge or trouble. Do you remember? When After Earth was released, it was mostly criticized for not being 'too dangerous'. The Martian is much worse. You cannot feel the danger, so does character! Because there is no real danger in the film. The main character behaves like John McClane at times, but he is not John McClane though. I mean a witty John McClane perfectly fits Die Hard franchise, but here it doesn't work. Most of the time, our man alone is 'happy'. And this 'happy' mood defines the tone of the film. I would even prefer Red Planet over The Martian, because despite Red Planet was just a passable popcorn flick, it was mysterious, dark, suspenseful and interesting. The story in The Martian is not interesting, because it is not a survival type of a movie! I am a Matt Damon fan, I can watch him peeling potatoes and onion for hours, I am such a fan, but even he was dull here. The Martian is also a talky film, in fact too much talky, but the story needs more visuals than chatting, in other words more silence than words. 3D was just fine except for a few dazzling Mars images. The film reminded me the masterpiece Silent Running and I wish it would have been as great as that movie. The final chapter of the movie becomes lazy, dull and cliché unfortunately and it cannot add something fresh to the story. And do I have to say the film lacks emotion and real entertainment which is weird. Additionally, some supporting characters were supposed to be funny, but actually they are not. I can prefer even Prometheus over The Martian honestly.",1,28,61,28 November 2015
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A painful memory
","I think that Coen Brothers are two of the greatest directors of all time, they are two of my favorite directors too. Art, entertainment and cinema feeling, most of their movies I have seen include all. People under-appreciated their last movie, No Country for Old Men and some people even hated it and say very overrated. To me the best Coen movies are Barton Fink and No Country for Old Men. However, O Brother where art Thou was not art, was not enjoyable and extremely insipid (lack of cinema feeling?) Besides, Coen Brothers make black comedies, there is black humor in their movies, except for Raising Arizona (it might be seen as black comedy too), but many people say that this movie is a definite comedy, it is very funny, full of laughs. There are a few possibilities. These people may be the people who have never watched any Peter Sellers film, Robin Williams film or Bill Murray film, these people may have a very different comedy conception or these people were cheerful at that time. Because, there was not even one moment I laughed or found funny in the movie. However, this is not important, it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, because it was not entertaining, it was not stylish (not art) and cinematically tasteless. Is there anything makes person flabbergasted, astonished? The only thing interesting was Red Kit reference. It is an uninspiring adventure of three men. The series of uninteresting events. I wish I did not write this review, because I have remembered the day I watched the movie.",1,3,11,30 December 2009
