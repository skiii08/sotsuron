Whip It," Teenage goal setting
","This movie seems targeted for 12-16 aged girls. It has a message for young girls to focus, pick yourself up, and to try to do well. So, in this way, this clean message way, it is similar to a Disney movie.I am a 60 year old male, and I liked it. It seemed much more gentle a story than I was expecting. There is no objectionable violence other than a few game sanctioned bumps and spills. So, I feel it gives a good message to young girls. And I think it will promote Roller Derby in the U.S. It shows how girls can channel their energy and drive to support the team. It has many 'team problems' and 'team support' issues to help young people understand team membership.I felt that Drew Berrymore did an acceptable job of directing the film. I would see it again.",7,3,11,3 October 2009
Fury," Unreal Hollywoodized Rambo Combat Scenes
","If you would read the reviews that give 5 stars or less, you will obtain a more realistic view of this movie. The story shows an American tank crew headed across Europe in Germany during the last week of the WWII. It is April of 1945. This crew is multi-racial and it displays some of their conflicts with one another and their surroundings and German survivors of the War.The tank is disabled by a land mine. Two Hundred Germans, likely SS soldiers are marching towards the disabled American tank. The Americans have time to load up and transfer all of the extra stored ammunition which is hanging carried on the outside of their tank to the inside of the tank before the Germans come. They do not haul inside the ammunition until 200 Germans are shooting at them at close range. Hiding and running would have been a rational choice given that the War is about to end within 5-11 days. But Brad Pitt chooses to stand and fight. I mean, the Americans and Russians are overwhelming Berlin in April 1945. What would you do?Similar to a Rambo movie, the protagonists in the tank choose to do a stand-off while cowering holed up against 200 enemy soldiers who surround the tank. They could have hidden in the bushes; there was time, but no, they choose to stay in their disabled tank to 'stay with the Sergeant' Brade Pitt. This means sure death for them. The Germans could have starved the Yanks out. Or waited until they wanted to go to the restroom. Then you shoot them with sniper fire as they get tired of smelling 'it'.The Germans do not seek cover against the firing machine guns of the tank. Rather, they run back and forth in front of the tank's blazing machine guns. I suppose the Germans are attracted to the firing machine guns like mosquitoes are attracted to heat and light. And this may be why the Germans lost WWII.The Germans put two hand grenades down the tank's top porthole. There is a hatch at the bottom of the tank for the Americans to escape. There is time for one soldier to wiggle out of the tank before the grenades explode. And he does this. All others, including Brad Pitt, are killed by the grenades. So, why didn't the soldier simply grab the grenades and hurl them out of the tank through the bottom porthole which was wide open? That would have taken 3 seconds per grenade and perhaps he could have made it, saving his team mates. The grenades have about a 5-6 second fuse delay.Then shortly afterward, an SS officer sees the alive soldier below the tank hiding alive and well. He doesn't shoot him. What does the SS soldier think the soldier is beneath the tank? He doesn't order him away from the tank. The SS soldier just leaves him alive without saying a word to him. I mean, who would be under a tank after a firefight?There is abusiveness by one American soldier to another who is new to combat. This is a kind of 'hazing'. Oh boy, adding 'realism'. He pulls on the ears of this new soldier. This abusive soldier handles the soldier in various ways to aggravate the new soldier. Doesn't it occur to the audience that in combat --you do this to a soldier and you could be 'shot by accident' in the next firefight? Oh, yes, there is a scene with a blown up face sitting on a shelf in the tank. The 1/3 face has no scratches on it, and the eye is perfectly in the socket of the piece-of-face. How could an eye remain the eye socket after the head has exploded from an anti-tank round?If you will read the criticisms of other reviewers, the ones with 1 or 2 star reviews, they will detail more story errors.This movie is not a 'Saving Private Ryan' level show. It shows soldiers taking unnecessary risks and then making bad tactical decisions. And that is what Rambo did. Rambo stood up to the enemy straight up and fired his machine gun from the hip. In real life he would last 3 seconds. And this is why returning Vietnam veterans were highly critical of Rambo and John Wayne movies. These movies give the viewer a false sense of security. You know what: If you have fears, it may be because you really are in danger. And if you want to live, you might be better off making like a mole. Yes, the grungy scenery, and the sleazy actor's lines may give this movie a sense of 'realism'; a tired soldier's viewpoint. But the macro view of this drama portrays unrealistic command decisions and motivations which may be acceptable in a video game only. To give this show a high rating is a disservice to critical viewers of IMDb ratings.I recommend movies like 'Come and See', 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Platoon', 'Das Boot' for war movies.I suppose this movie was made without any consultation with real Tank veterans. But one plus of the movie is that it has a real 'Tiger Tank' in it being driven around.So, go see this movie, but don't start thinking about all the unrealistic issues with it. If it makes you feel lucky to live in a Country not at war, then it has a positive purpose in your life. And it might make you feel further grateful to those tank crews that fought during WWII.So, this movie is 1/2 good, and 1/2 technically bad. It is more 'grinding' than inspiring. 'B' movie fits the description of this film.",6,7,16,27 October 2014
The Impossible," Most painful movie of the year
","I cannot see this movie as 'entertainment'. It is a trip through hell and 15 kinds of human pain and suffering. How can I say that I got nothing from this movie except to say that I feel lucky to live where I do.I do not want to see this movie again. It is more than a horror movie. I had to shield my eyes many times just to decrease the painful input. There was only one small moment during the movie where someone was slightly smiling. This movie is 3 times more painful than 'Zero Dark Thirty' and 'Zero Dark' had torture in it.I now have more fearful respect for consequences of a Tsunami. Every painful thing that can happen to a person in such a disaster is presented in this movie. It overwhelmed me and I wanted to walk out. But I stayed. My day was slightly ruined by this movie. My mood was muted and somewhat dark all day afterward. If that is how you want to feel afterward, then you must see this movie.Perhaps it will someday become a Cult Film. As in: Wanna' know how it feels to be drowned, really? I am tired and beat just remembering it as I write this review. I do not want to see it again, ever.",9,4,9,4 January 2013
Public Enemies," Classic gangster movie with a heart
","Very satisfying movie. This film has a great deal of violence and it is perfected. At times i felt I was playing a video game. I felt that John D. was a born risk taker. He would have been a fine race car driver if he had not robbed banks for a living. The breakouts were amazing. What a brazen man! I loved the dark rich colors, reminded me of the Godfather. The 'handycam' work made the gunfights so realistic; the sounds of gunfire really used the theater's pro sound system.Now that the banks don't want to lend, maybe we need another John D. to loosen them up and teach them a lesson. I would see this movie again.",8,3,8,2 July 2009
Black Book," Tight Romantic Thriller
","If you like 'Casablanca', you will like 'Black Book'.If you are interested in WWII movies, you will be pleased with 'Black Book'. Subtitles do not distract from your understanding of this movie. Yes, violence is present.Immediately I fell into this movie although I was 20 minutes late for it. I certainly reminded me of Hollywood movies of the 1940s sans the out of focus halos around the heroine. Colors are rich and sharp here compared to Hollywood's black and white versions of WWII events. And you may wonder how they found these derelict buildings seen in the film.I think that some comparison to 'The Pianist' is fair. We are viewing survival methods of a women who is also a spy. We follow her inner conflicts and loyalties during WWII as she represents 'the resistance'. Sex play is contained therein as she manipulates the right people.If I sound cool, you're right. But this is a film loaded with action, conflict, comparisons to Greta Garbo, violence, romantic style, and vulgar displays of human incarceration. This may be called a romantic thriller. And strangely, we feel a little empathy for a Guestoppo who manages to submit to the lures of the leading romantic lady who is also a Heb and a spy. (spoiler) The violence is 'normal' Nazi machine gunning and two people get a hatchet in the face in the last days of the war. And do those Nazi's look real.(end of spoiler) After 2.5 hours, I felt satisfied, never bored. And I felt as if I had learned more of history. I appreciated the sacrifices of the 'Resistance Fighters' during WWII. Based upon a true story.",9,17,26,22 April 2007
American Sniper," Tight, Elegant, Combat Scenes
","A story of the highly talented Seal Sniper Chris Kyle. This film avoids the complications of the political reasons America occupied Iraq. In its place, we follow the personal motivations of a young man who enjoys physical activity as a cowboy rodeo rider. His personal morality is summed up in just a few sentences: Don't be a bully. Don't be a victim. Be the protector that eliminates the bully. And so it logically follows that as a SEAL sniper he can practice what he preaches.Kyle protects fellow Marines as they enter a war zone and do house to house searches. He has no qualms about killing anyone who is in the area to do harm to the Marines; and this includes women and children. While the viewer may blanch at the thought of killing children; please remember that these children are armed and used to destroy Marines in various ways. So far so good.We follow Chris Kyle into his family life. Director Eastwood keeps the focus on the protagonist's Post Traumatic Stress. And Eastwood uses manipulative symbols to place the viewer in the shoes of Chris Kyle. Thus, I left the theater with a mild case of Post Traumatic Stress. Someone on the elevator said, 'What is that, there?' and I freaked. I was still 'in the movie'; I was still in the war zone. When a movie does this to you, place you in the protagonist's position, it has elevated itself to a remarkable movie. I now understand Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. This movie is not entertainment. Rather, it is a journey in another person's life.This movie has its references to the American Flag, yet it does not explore reasons why we are occupying other countries. It seems that American values such as the freedom to speak freely, to make personal decisions about religious choices; to make occupational career decisions freely; are enough justification to feel good about America.Kyle is pictured as an honored legend, a protector of soldiers. He is not referred to as a 'hero' in the movie. Certainly to volunteer for combat means he is placing his emotional life in the balance. And this movie follows him and displays the consequences of Post Combat Stress Syndrome. This means his memory will not let go of the combat environment which he has been in when he 'comes home'. I have read many of the bad reviews of this movie. It seems that most of them are a personal try at propaganda making, exaggerated, emotional statements that roam from political views to moral views. These people simply damn Kyle for being a sniper. Yet, in Kyle's view, his conscious is clear. He is on a side, and he protects the soldiers of the side he is on. He does not return to the U.S. in any way confused as to his loyalties.The elegance of these scenes has to do with Eastwood's direction and timing. He manipulates the viewer to live the stress, the wonder of combat in a sandstorm. Every scene follows logically and flows. Is the movie simply a recruiting vehicle for the Navy? My answer is no. It shows the real life consequences for volunteering for war duty. To be propaganda, we would have to be placed in a state wherein we are making machine decisions using our emotions while the underlying facts are twisted. Since there is a great deal of discussion on IMDb, this discussion will make you 'immune to propaganda' before you see the film. Discussion and free speech is what disables the propaganda machine. You won't be volunteering for duty tomorrow, or next week like a robot.Is the movie true? Probably. The scenes are mostly ordinary incidents which are intensified by the fact that combat happened somewhere, sometime. You will follow Kyle's journey. This movie is not a Rambo movie. Kyle is never pictured making over the top advances towards the enemy. I recommend you see it.",9,43,89,17 January 2015
Rush," Glorious Obsession
","One of the BEST MOVIES OF THE YEAR for sure. This movie is about friendship, marriage, attaining goals, perseverance. I was kept on the edge of my seat throughout the movie. Never a dull moment. Lovely vintage race cars. This movie will motivate you to get off your ass to 'do it'. The sex scenes in this movie are as wild as the racing. Yet, this movie has a beating heart; a heart that beats at 10,000 rpm. You absolutely must see this movie. One of the best racing and friendship movies of all time. Why as I write this, it is rated in the top 100 movies of all time.The sound track is strong. The visuals make you feel you are actually racing. You care about these characters through their all dilemmas and triumphs. I am exhausted after seeing it. And I have seen it 7 times. Go to U-Tube and look over videos which are 1 hour long regarding the rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt. View the entire length and marvel at the authenticity of this movie; and notice how closely the real people resemble the actors in this movie.Take a date to this movie. How it is that anyone could criticize it in any technical or dramatic fashion is beyond me. Every scene is finely crafted. I am a professional photographer and I admire the direction and choices the screenwriter and director have made. Sure, there are those that want more racing track time, but this is a deeper story about friendship and rivalry. You must see it in your lifetime.",10,2,3,27 September 2013
Watchmen," Boring for 50 - 60 year old
","The audience was filled with 24 year old men. What we have here are superheros in Halloween costumes. I never once believed anyone was a superhero. One was a fake 'batman'. The violence is graphic with hatchet in-the-head moves. Seen that, nothing new. There is sex action that adds no sensuality, no love. All the boys want to see the female superhero do sex. So what. There are spacecraft, so what, nothing new. They go to Mars, O.K. Lots of high tech graphics, so what, seen that, done that in other movies.The actors mostly speak in breathy tones like they are reading lines for the second time. They are overly impressed with themselves in other words. The movie was nearly 3 hours long. I was bored and depressed after-wards. I never believed for a moment that anyone was a superhero. There are scenes with women beating up men like a Mike Tyson. I can't believe that! Then the women gets beat up very badly by a man. This is entertainment? What this is, is a fantasy that cannot be believed. If you are 50 - 60 years old you will enjoy the Jimmy Hendricks music. There is a midget actor that was good as a 'big man' in the 'big house'. But that was it. The only thing new about this movie was the costumes.",4,8,18,7 March 2009
Foxcatcher," Money Can't Buy Me Love
","This is a relationship movie. The background action that moves the story forward is about a young man's desire to become an Olympic Champion Wrestler.If you like 'Psycho' you will like this movie. And like 'Psycho' it is a true story.The movie unfolds in a disturbingly subtle and harmless manner. Because of this, the 'action movie' theater goers will be lulled into boredom. They won't see that all of this is a 'set up' for the horror that is to be.This film explores the development and motivations of male bonding. And it depicts how males can fall into or reject unhealthy relationships with other men. These relationships can be described as: Brother, Son, Coach, Mentor (Teacher).It also shows how inherited wealth can rob a person of authentic achievement. And these particular people may then set about to become authentic, goal oriented individuals without going through the school of 'hard knocks'. The result is empty trophy gathering for these privileged few. So, this movie has a moral and a warning to those who are wealthy.No, this is not a 'Rocky' film. It is rather a tragedy, a true story that will make you think. If you like to analyze relationships; figuring out what motivates whomever; you will like this film.Go see it.",8,3,9,9 January 2015
Django Unchained," I walked out.
","This is not a spaghetti western. Django is not a superhero. It's a comedy trying to use the foil of slavery, torture, KKK to fool us into laughing. We are to laugh at the KKK.The actors seem listless at times. It reminds me of a sitcom in that way; they are sometimes deadpan waiting for the canned laughter to roll in.Richard Pryor could make white people laugh at themselves. His satire was timely. This movie is not timely. It's too late.I heard some audience members laugh. So, it may be the mood I am in. I wanted to laugh. I didn't laugh; I walked out.",3,14,32,6 January 2013
Jersey Boys," Loved it. This movie will leave you with a great feeling!
","Hardly an extra word spoken in this movie. Actors did portray the feeling of the 1960s. I know, I lived through them. You will see America in haircuts and fashions before America went long hair.This movie with leave you with a good feeling when you leave. I love how they dressed, Classy. This film will be especially poignant for Baby Boomers. They will be able to remember their 'teen days, before the long hair fashions appeared. Also, Baby Boomers will no doubt be amused as to how polite people are to one another oftentimes in this movie, which is another aspect of the 1950s. The 1950s were dominated by parents who taught their children to have respect.It is no surprise to me that women who are over 45 scored this movie the highest on IMDb of all other groups. This movie is a trip down lover's lane, holding hands, pony tails, poodle skirts, and Frankie Valle tunes about adoration, caring, walking like a man, and twist parties. This was the 50's as I knew it, too. And one of the codes of the 1950s is that boys should 'walk like a man'. And men should adore their women. They should give their date attention and respect. Another 'code' is that debts should be repaid. And friends should be loyal even during rough times; keep a clean appearance. Be respectful to authority. To a reviewer, this may make the movie ordinary, bland, uneventful. But to a Baby Boomer, these culture traits of the 1950s will be fondly remembered especially compared to the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.Now, what makes this film more interesting is the understanding that the Four Seasons had connections to the mob. This fact makes their story a surprise. Note that there is minimal violence in this movie. Sexuality is muted, just as it was in movies of the 1950s. So, this movie will not titillate for this reason; rather it is a musical bringing back memories and scribing a history of the success of the musical singing group, 'The Four Seasons.'This is not a movie for the modern man of 2014 who needs porn, burning cars, outrageous behavior, computer graphics, monsters, super heroes, toilet humor, and scenes with drug use to enjoy the movie. This movie has none of that.There are some mild stereotypes used which simply add humor to this show. The language accents of the 'Jersey Boys' may be of the 1950s, but not now. (Maybe New Jersey has had its accent diluted by Mid Westerners moving in over the years.) These young men had beginnings as occasional thieves and burglars but at some point decided to capitalize on their talents so they went 'straight'. This story is not a 'Goodfellas' story. They were never members of the mob. And they never did anything more serious than steal in their early years.This is an adaptation of a Broadway musical by the same name. The same actors are used for this film that appeared on Broadway. And they sing in person without lip syncing on the film set. The tunes are sentimental, rock n' roll, happy tunes. A time or two the lighting is actually 'stage set lighting'. This type of lighting is not meant to create realism, rather it is used to simplify the scene and place the actors 'on a stage' front and center. And this set=up can then be used for an actor to sing! Well, yes, they sing! So, IF YOU LIKE THESE TUNES THAT ARE SUNG, YOU WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE ALL THE MORE. The direction of the movie is nearly flawless. I have directed stage, and I am a pro photographer. Everything he has stage blocked in this movie flows well. The timing was 'on' for actor's movement every word of the way. Eastwood is a good director.This movie has a 'good message' about perseverance, being loyal to friends, honor, working hard towards success, becoming a more upstanding individual, and of course, enjoyment of romantic music. Now, how it does all this in a New Jersey '1950's culture format' is for yours to see.The audiences I have been with are mostly gray haired Baby Boomers. I have enjoyed it equally the two times I have seen it, even after reading all of the critical reviews made by IMDb members. I wondered where these critical reviews and negative comments could come from. So, I have sorted out the comments and it seems that there are groups of people who: (1) Want a more unusual, freaky movie; (2) They cannot enjoy the movie because to them the Broadway musical is superior, (3) They are not familiar with the 1950's and have no fond memories of it to re-live, (4) They just wholesale write that everything is bad about the movie despite the fact that other people love it.Do not have any high expectations before you go in. This is light entertainment which is funny in a clean manner. There is some disrespect thrown around. The dark side of the movie balances out the lighter parts. Eastwood did not want to make a 'fluff piece'. There are some serious moments of drama in the film. Do not be offended if the 'f word' is used 3-4 times. This is the sole reason that it earned an 'R' rating.This is a date movie. The tunes are all 'up'; good feeling music awaits you.Now don't think about it. Just do it! Go see it!",7,9,16,28 June 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Jessica Chastain is too beautiful.
","I wish I could believe that one person was doggedly responsible for maintaining the focus on the manhunt (womanhunt?) for Osama. But I cannot. Jessica Chastain says in her IMDb biography that the facts are real, its a real story about this woman. I cannot. Maya, the Heroine is too beautiful to be believable. She's a '10' in beauty and a '10' in persistence.The soldiers are likable and loyal. They are heroes and all of this action will attract more recruits to the Army. I cannot find any fault or criticism in the way the Director portrayed them.Because this movie does not touch the heartstrings, it is sort of gritty all of the way through, it left me speechless. I watched a one dimensional story with a already known ending. Another dimension could have been portrayed with the (false) story of some lovers. This heroine does not have any friends the movie says. Think of 'Titanic', an action/drama movie that had a 2nd dimension regarding some lovers tucked into the story. Here we only have persistence and action.I wonder how Muslims view this movie.To be sure, Karen Bigelow is a master crafts-women of action movies. But movie of the year? 'Lincoln' gave me time to reflect on moral issues, law, the character of Lincoln and other historical facts. This movie 'Zero Dark Thirty' seems to try to gain something by showing us 'how to torture'. Take the towel, take the water, pour it on the towel. We've learned how to torture.In Lincoln, on the other hand, we saw the manner in which moral gray areas were decided upon. Here in Zero Dark, we see there is a procedure to torturing somebody. Step 1, 2, 3. Pretend to be their friend, then torture them if they don't tell the truth. I think this movie could have had more depth if the moral issue of torture were attended to.I cannot agree that this is movie of the year. It never hit my 'revenge button' because this is old history. I liked how well it was paced with no slop. It is a well crafted one dimensional action movie that uses a heroine who is too beautiful to be believable. Please, Hollywood, please stop using these gorgeous women to always take our attention away. In this case, it disallowed me to focus on the revenge motive. It glamorized the heroine for her persistence; yet it was the soldiers who were the heroes.I felt that 'The Impossible' was a more painful movie to watch. I feel that 'Lincoln' should be a a more likely pick for movie of the year. Sorry audience.",7,5,32,4 January 2013
Get Him to the Greek," A bomb; I walked-out
","All actors appeared to be reading their lines. Lots of f**k-you 'jokes'. Disprespect towards women, especially 70 year-old mothers. Vomit jokes. Sex on toilets. They use the pain of being African in a poor village to create a white plastic bohemian Christ to save the Africans through megadeath rock music promotion. Gangster gags played by inept actors. Uninspired references to taking drugs and especially alcohol. All the actors seemed to be in love with themselves. If you are a baby boomer, you will wonder what this movie is supposed to be and to do. It wasn't funny, and few in the audience laughed at any time.A few nice views of London. That's why I gave it a 2.",2,14,42,5 June 2010
Moon," Existential dirty dishes on the Moon
","I liked it. The piano music played throughout kept the tone of the movie from becoming too sterile, lonely. This movie displays some dull life on the moon. The piano music will pull your heart strings alittle, keeping you in there. The moon scenes are very realistic looking. Although I was dead tired and sleepy, I didn't go to sleep during the movie! Now that is saying something for me! I feel that this is a classic movie. It attempts to touch man's identity, how we determine our worth. Are we what we do? Are we what we join? Are we our family? Are we illegal immigrants if we work on the Moon and then return to Earth? I didn't expect a science related movie to touch on existential subject matter. This movie will make you think about your family. It will make you think about how you put together your identity. No, it isn't merely a movie with crash bang action and explosions on the Moon. This isn't an action movie. It's a movie for thinkers..This movie is edited tightly. There is only one scene where there is some happiness. I suppose you could compare it to a movie about a lonely soldier in WWII who only has a few days to go before the end of his war time assignment. But because it is sci fi, and realistic, you have more to consider: The subject of human cloning comes up. The issue of 'where is home'? ...is another matter to contend with. And even more, you must think about a business establishment's loyalty to its workers as an issue. I haven't given you the answers here so that you will see the movie. I consider this a true classic, one which may well be used as an example in film classes.",9,42,72,26 June 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," You'll be thankful you live in America when you see this film
","This is a Thanksgiving movie. You will thank your mother for having born you in the U.S.A. Imagine begging for a living. Then imagine people who own people who then go out and beg for the owners. Then imagine the owners who physically deface some of their cadre of beggars so that they can earn more money through the greater pity attracted by the defaced beggar. This is only 2% of this movie, so take heart; there's a lot more. It isn't a downer, it's an inspiration. This movie will pull you through the life and times of a child beggar in India. You will follow his triumphs, his love story, his devotion to his friends. You will see a beggar 10 year's old give money to a 'lessor' blinded beggar child out of pity and mutual respect for the suffering blind child. Child beggars giving to child beggars. Oh, how Thankful You Will Feel when you walk through the exit door of the theater past the warming popcorn and into your street crammed with new, polished Mercedes, Fords and Chevy's on a clear evening with the streetlights glistening. You will ask yourself how it is that you could complain so much lately about your own life after seeing this movie. This movie touches real human values. It is one of the best movies of 2008. I recommend you recommend this movie to anyone who is depressed about their life. An alternative movie to see, and just as inspiring is, 'The Pursuit of Happiness' with Will Smith. Also, 'Seabiscuit'. This movie will drop you down into your soul. It has a happy ending!",10,0,1,28 November 2008
Mad Max: Fury Road," Grinding, Boring, Empty, Cartoonish
","This movie will bore adults who are over 40 years old. They have seen this type of video game before. I could not understand their words, rarely, because of their accents. But I knew and saw of the 2nd 'Road Warrior' with Mel Gibson. I liked that movie a lot. It had style; it took me to an odd end of the world idea I had never contemplated.This movie is similar to 'The Temple of Doom'. It seems that mountains need to be carved up with skull symbols. What a lot of work for a people who are trying to survive on nothing: Carving up mountains with skull symbols.The problem here is that the hero is immediately made into a slave. Whereas Mel Gibson had that cool sawed off shotgun to tuck into his belt, this hero has nothing so symbolic.I will get right down to it. I was bored 1/2 way through. I started to fall asleep in the middle of one of the latter chase scenes. This was because I did not expect to see anything new.The color of the sands was saturated by photo shop. This gave it an unreal look. So, I felt it was more of an alien planet. But no, this was Earth. I could not understand the plot. They were trying to save a water truck or something.If you are bored reading this review; just think how bored I was trying to figure out what was going on in this movie. Lots of action to get across the desert. I could see that in spades. But I could not understand why many of the people had white as an egg skin color. They looked like aliens. But this was earth. I could not understand why the cars had to be so layered with do dads. It looked fake.The first Road Warrior, actually the second film in this series I loved. They have added polish and paint, and do dads, and weird skin paint and wrecked this line of movies.The one film critic, Mick La Salle gave this movie a '50' out of 100 points. I think I agree with him and with none of the others.This movie is for kids. It is for people who have only seen a few movies in their lifetime.",3,11,26,19 May 2015
The Pursuit of Happyness," Soulful Inspiration: You care and you cry
","This movie was more than I expected. I am a pro photographer and I am very critical of the director's work. Firstly, this movie has a quick pace about it. We are never left with a sappy feeling. When scenes ARE slowed down our heart feels truly empathetic to this father and son duo. This, above all, is a personal movie. We are entertained by how a struggling father entertains his son and keeps his son happy through a number of sad situations. And then we are delighted by how the son keeps the father happy, as young as he is. And because these two 'Muskateers' show caring for one another, we care about them. They are two good people. And we want good people to succeed! By the way, there is no violence in this film, only some anger. You won't see them become criminals to survive either! You will be involved throughout this film with their trials and errors. You will cry and care and hope WITH them, not just FOR them because you WILL be involved in scene after scene. The time will fly. The director surprisingly chose to use a gritty grainy color film style which increases the realism of this movie. The handy-cam, a walking camera, adds style to the realism and rush of this movie due to some deliberate jerky camera movement in a handful of minor scenes. When Chris Gardener (Will Smith) asks someone to pay back a small loan of money($14), you feel like you are standing right next to Will Smith as he begs. And regarding the rushed feeling: Fathers just don't have time to be fatherly, make sales calls without a car by riding the bus, and survive homeless on the street all on the same day. Will Smith's emotional range is wide here. He has a little of that comedian, that optimism in him, but he shows his universal soul. This is what amazes audiences. The new Will Smith, actor of drama. And the Italian director gave him time to emote! Therefore, you will be delighted with his nuances of emotion from scene to scene. This film is comfortably realistic. Will Smith deserves an Oscar for acting.The music is all good: Steve Wonder, Gospel music from Glide Church; not one mediocre tune exists in this film.San Francisco as a setting will thrill those in the mid west with tall views of the city and Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. But this story is not about showcasing places as you would see in a James Bond movie. Rather, you will be taken into Glide Memorial Church where the City's homeless are feed food and soul gospel music. Concentrate on the emotions of the audience, it is so, so real. And yes, I have eaten there and stood in line there. There is no sense that poverty is simply a fleeting condition. Your good spirit will save you. Personal diligent effort will save you. And Will Smith takes it as it comes. And there are no guarantees your pursuit will end up in happiness. It is not decreed in life, or the Constitution, and it is not decreed in this movie. The supporting actress was so realistic. She challenges Will Smith with her impatience. You will be rooting for Will Smith and you will care that these two characters, father and son, find their rainbow: which may only be as humble as finding appropriate employment. Will Smith is never foolishly arrogant. To be so would raise the odds against his survival. The miracle here is how you end up crying for someone that simply accomplishes that which we take for granted, something so mundane as getting a job. This film looks like a documentary at times.No person seems trite: The landlord is not a parody or a character of a landlord, you know that he is a real person with his own problems. The people are not extraordinary people, you believe them as they are, whatever they are. No one over acts. You are never distracted by a 'false' character, not even the 'Time Machine Man'. And you wonder if maybe these people are actually non-actors chosen to do what they already do in their 'real life'. But it is a fact that the homeless people in the movie are actually homeless people employed to be in the movie. I live here and I was an actor in the movie. I know this to be true. There were only 3-4 people who acted homeless in this movie, and you know what, their scenes were cut.This is not a cleaned-up Disney movie. This movie has soul and spirit. It is funny and ironic that the one obscene word is uttered by the 5 year old child. And there are some light hearted jokes that will touch you.If you liked the movie 'Seabiscuit' you will like this movie. You will root for this ordinary person as he pushes his spirit against extraordinary odds to survive and to attain his vision of success. But this movie is not dead centered around survival, and the homeless scenes are few. We are really drawn to the conversations between the father and son. And the kid is cute and smart. You never feel he is reading any lines. This movie is really about the relationship of the father to his son.The book reminds you that even if you only attain 'baby steps' towards your goal you are on the path to your own success. You are reminded that if you are an 'A' student, you need to have a humble caring attitude to succeed too. And Will Smith is humble here. Oh yes, he gets angry and he isn't perfect....and his emotional range is wide. He deserves an Oscar for truly carrying this film to its perfectly happy destination.",9,5,9,16 December 2006
Valkyrie," Mission Impossible
","Indeed this mission was impossible. This movie is named after a Wagner composition. Wagner gave verve to the German spirit during WWII with its driving musical compositions. But this Valkyre tune is also the name of the operation of the defense forces which would help to replace the German Government after Hitler were to be killed by whomever. There was a plan to protect the integrity of the German Government should Hitler die for any reason. Van Stauffenberg attempted to control this operation already in place and to place himself in control of it when Hitler were to be killed.This movie helps to cleanse Germany of its sins. It will be welcome there. Tom Cruise has shed any boyishness in his portrayal of the Col. Stauffenberg. Therefore, it all works. The movie moves along like a 'Raiders of the Lost Arc' with few slow moments. The tension builds and builds and you will not be immune to it. I believed everything. I saw no flaw that would be amusing. This is a serious movie, not entertainment.I gave it an '8' because I felt it was not as creative as some other movies. But then this is because it sticks to the facts. It is a historical movie not a creative romp.You will leave this movie with a serious demeanor, but there is still the saving grace that good triumphed over evil eventually. And if you are German you can choose to identify with the good guys now. Hitler is not made much of in this movie.Everything flows from one event to another with smoothness and sometimes passion. Everything is explained well. I think everyone should see it once if just to remember that there were other types of Germans involved in WWII who did not walk the party line.I feel it is one of the best movies of the year, perhaps in the top 15 of the year.",8,72,131,25 December 2008
