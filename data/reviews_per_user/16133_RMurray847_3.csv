Catch Me If You Can," Delightful fun!!
","It's nice to have Spielberg movie that doesn't have to be loaded with portent.  Don't get me wrong, I like portent, but I went to this expecting escapism (based on the trailers) and I got it in spades! I was immediately caught up in the movie and enchanted by the light story.  The characters were all likable. The period details really great  (check out DiCaprio's Bachelor pad when he's pretending to be a doctor).  Even the John William's score works nicely for a change.  Everyone is working in the same light-hearted vein, and the tone is very nice and consistent throughout.DiCaprio is very charming and believable, and in his few serious scenes, he brings some real pain to the proceedings.  I hope this and Gangs of New York helps us remember that he actually was (and is) a good actor, and not just that obnoxious playboy from the post-Titanic days.  Tom Hanks is great:  we root for him to catch DiCaprio, and we root for DiCaprio not to get caught. That's part of the fun!  And Christopher Walken really gives one of his best performances in a long time.  He's the most 'serious' character in the film, but he shows terrific heart and spirit, and only occasionally falls back to his 'creepy' mannerisms.This is not a serious work.  It is meant to lighten your mood with a competent, straightforward telling of a truly engaging story.  And it succeeds.  I say 'catch it if you can.'",8,0,0,31 December 2002
Any Given Sunday," Unconvincing characters
","Stone always has people who 'represent' a point of view first, and are characters second.  (Classic example...Tom Berenger & Willem Dafoe in PLATOON).  However, usually his filmmaking is strong enough to make us believe the people anyway.  This is a lightweight Stone, and his female characters in particular are unconvincing.  Cameron Diaz is horribly miscast...she gets to cuss and act mean, but to what purpose other than to be the character that represents 'young, money-hungry, tradition-despising business people of today.'  Lauren Holly...what the heck was that character?!?!  And Pacino, who can be good, is allowed to indulge in all his mannerisms, but to no purpose. I kept expecting a line like 'I try to get out of football...but they always pull me back.'I enjoyed some of the more minor characters a bit more...some of the young football players were really well done.  James Wood was wasted, though.",6,0,0,1 June 2001
The Thin Red Line," EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES
","Critics raved about the director's past work.  Were eager to see new work, especially such an attractive cast and such and ambitious subject.  They saw the movie.  The movie was 'artsy.'  They raved.  But did anyone understand it?  I don't care how 'philosophical' it was, or how pretty the flowers on the island looked in contrast to the brutality of war.  It was virtually impossible to follow the strategy of the soldiers or frankly to care what was going on or to care about the characters.I think no one is willing to say that the movie is actually too-long, boring, ploddingly paced (inexcusable for a war movie) and poorly acted by most.YUCK!",2,3,4,1 June 2001
