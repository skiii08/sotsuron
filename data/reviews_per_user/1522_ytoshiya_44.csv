Forrest Gump," My favorite movie
","I learned three important things from this movie.
Firstly, 'Difference is no difference'. That's truly true. What is wrong with difference? Everyone has each difference so that having differences in yourself is not different.
Secondary, 'True love'. I could see true love from this movie. Even if you see your feelings to the one you love impossible love, continue to care. That love would come true trult someday.
Finally, 'Continuing to challenge untill the end'. If you challenged something untill the end without giving up, your dream would come true though there would be a lot of walls you would face at. What I could see from this movie was 'Never give up'.",10,1,1,3 January 2019
