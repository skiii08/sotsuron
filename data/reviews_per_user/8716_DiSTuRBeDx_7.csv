The Avengers," Billionaire, playboy, philanthropist
","The Avengers. What to say? What to say that the millions of other people haven't said already? I know, exactly what they already said. I really enjoyed The Avengers. I'm not a big fan of all-out action films but this one impressed me. It tied all the characters well and provided a few laughs. The action wasn't over the top but there wasn't too little of it either. As you would expect from this genre of film.The directing and cinematography were very good and the acting was great from everyone. Especially Downey, who is wooing me into liking him, because I usually don't like his films but as of late he's been some good ones. Any fan of superhero or action should defiantly watch this film.",8,3,8,14 June 2012
Drive," Not the masterpiece it has claimed to be, but still an enjoyable watch
","The film is good. Defiantly not 8.0 or as good as everybody says but still enjoyable. There are a few plot holes and inconsistencies but I still enjoyed watching it. As I said before it had a few plot holes and inconsistencies it was also riddled with very obvious dialog and scenarios which doesn't really make it a masterpiece as everyone is calling it.I don't normally like Ryan Gosling but he was good in this, and he suited the character, although the character didn't really have much depth I still enjoyed watching his life as it went up and down and spiraled out of control. The character just felt flat, he felt lazily written. And with a film like this you need to connect to the character, much like Taxi Driver and A Clockwork Orange.Overall, I enjoyed it and I would recommend it. But the praise is undeserved and it is overrated. Although, as I said, it is a nice little watch if you have 100 minutes or so to spare.",7,0,3,17 June 2012
Kick-Ass," Way too overrated
","It was OK. I don't normally enjoy action films and this can be included. It is a very good action film but not a good film. The acting was good, the directing was really good, everything was good. I just didn't like the script and I just didn't enjoy it. I wanted to enjoy it but I just couldn't.I like films when the action scenes are well directed like 300 but I just felt it was all over the top. And the jet pack, Jesus Christ the jet pack. The premise was good and the cast was good, I just didn't feel like they went anywhere with it. They could've, but didn't. It tried to be funny and it wasn't as funny as it thought too which just annoyed me.Fans of action films will love this because, as I said, the action is very good. I mean, visually, it is great but logically, it just isn't. And I don't think it can compete with other action films, especially any film based off a graphic novel like 300 or Sin City.",6,4,9,17 June 2012
A Clockwork Orange," Alex and his three droogs
","This film is really good. I like Kubrick and his films bring so much to cinema he is just so amazing and this film is no exception. I love it. It creates this massive criminal. A boy who just beats and rapes for fun. And then when things happen to him it makes you feel sympathetic towards him and the second half of the film has so much tension and is very though provoking.I love Kubrick and any body who is a fan of Kubrick will love this film, this film also is just a masterclass in cinema from a master of doing controversial films. And it's controversial I like. All the violence and sex is aesthetic. The whole point of it is to build up the protagonist. When you understand the meaning behind it all, it just is brilliant. It's amazing how, when you see him beating or raping people you look down upon him, then when he becomes the victim you can't help but feel extremely sorry for him. Kubrick has created a masterpiece.",9,0,2,14 June 2012
The Shawshank Redemption," You'll get it when you see it.
","A very, very, very brilliant film. The acting is superb from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, as always. The script was amazing, along with the directing. The film is one of the best films ever made due to how original it is. And the reason it is original is because it is a prison film with heart. It makes you care about criminals. The score is also very good.It's an enthralling piece of cinema and just... Amazing. I'd recommend this film to anyone due to everyone relating to it. People like films were you are sympathetic towards a criminal, just look at A Clockwork Orange.",9,3,4,14 June 2012
Prometheus," Because we can
","I really enjoyed it. I like Ridley Scott's work - Alien, Blade Runner, American Gangster - and this can be added to one of his best. It's very good, the acting was superb, especially Michael Fassbender who I assume will be getting into more major roles in the future. The film, overall, was visually amazing. The sets and the universe in which it creates looks and feels amazing.Of course, there are a few obvious scenes but my hunger was satisfied for this film because of how much I hyped it up in my head. There theories, although trying to be smart, come off as aesthetic. Although the film is enjoyable, just don't expect a masterpiece or anything better than the first two Alien films.",8,0,4,14 June 2012
The Godfather," An Offer You Can't Refuse
","A masterpiece. An amazing film. Brilliant performances from everyone. The directing of Francis Ford Copolla was unbelievable, the cinematography was flawless, along with the script. Also the original score was very, very good. The film is filled with amazing lines that you can't help but quote.An enthralling film which grabs you hold and doesn't let you go until an hour after the end, because you think about it for so long afterwards. One of the best films I have ever seen and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys Scorsese or anyone with an interest in organized crime. And come on, who doesn't like a bit of organized crime?",9,0,2,14 June 2012
