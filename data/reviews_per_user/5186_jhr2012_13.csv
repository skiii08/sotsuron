Hereditary," Greatest horror movie ever? No!
","What movie were you people watching? I swear, this site needs to create two separate ratings scales; one for aspiring movie critics and actors who can debate the cinematography, wardrobe selections, and camera angles, and the other for people who judge movies solely based on their entertainment value; was it an entertaining movie and worth the price of admission? 
This movie is worthy of a $2.00 rental. The first half is incredibly slow and boring. I almost walked out from shear boredom. But then it picked up in the second half and managed to hold my attention. The ending was, in a word, strange. 
5 stars at best.",3,1,3,10 June 2018
World War Z," Exceptional!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I was skeptical, as I don't typically like 'zombie' movies, but this was very well done. There's lot's of suspense, and Brad Pitt was great.What I also liked is that they made the movie without a lot of bloody gore, which I find amazing given the subject matter. There are a lot of scenes that could have been gory for sure, but the Director chose not to focus on that, for which he is to be commended. Instead, he stuck to the plot line and the end result is exceptional.No need to see it in 3D; stick with the 2D version and save a few bucks. Well worth the price of admission! You won't be disappointed!",10,9,17,30 June 2013
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Uh......no
","I love Will Ferrell but this is not the vehicle for him. I have never found comedy 'musicals' of any sort to be funny; they're just not. I prefer movies like Step Brothers, The 40 Year Old Virgin, and Sex Drive. There is nothing laugh out loud funny about this one.",2,8,22,30 June 2020
The Hateful Eight," Exceptional
","I just watched this movie again and it gets better every time I see it. It's quickly becoming my favorite movie. The blend of characters, story line, and dialog, is exceptional. It's violent for sure, but also quite funny. The performances of Samuel Jackson, Walton Coggins, and Kurt Russell are first rate. The scenery is amazing and the backdrop of the blizzard is great. With the snow, wind, and gaps in the haberdashery siding, you could just imagine how cold people would have been in such a setting.
It's a great flick, and certainly worth a second look.",10,1,2,7 May 2019
Suicide Squad," Definitely worth a look
","For the most part, I hate super hero movies. Absolutely hate them. All of the Marvel characters; Superman, Batman, etc. I've never understood the appeal. However, my kids wanted to see this movie and I agreed to go along.I wasn't expecting much, but I was quite surprised, as this wasn't your typical (anti) superhero movie. Still a lot of silly characters (Killer Croc, what the heck was that?), but the story line, action, and dialog were pretty good.Margot Robbie stole the show however. She did an amazing job. I was very impressed. Will Smith was pretty good as well; not his usual over the top arrogant character. Well, maybe a little, but not as much as some of his movies. All in all, a pretty good summer time flick. Kids will love it.",6,0,2,6 August 2016
Bird Box," Strange flick
","This movie has its moments, but it could have been far better had there been some background or explanation for the 'creatures'. what are they; where did they come from; something, anything. As it is, you have all these characters running around with blindfolds on, afraid of what? I prefer to see the monsters in such movies.",3,5,11,25 December 2018
Knowing," Riveting thriller
","I love this movie. I just watched it again for about the 4th time and it never fails to delight. Thought provoking, a great story, good acting, and Nicholas Cage. What more could you want? It's a winner all around!",10,2,5,25 May 2019
War Machine," Was this supposed to be funny?
","Because it sure as hell wasn't. I could only make it through about 30 minutes of this crap, but that was sufficient to tell me this was a misguided mess of a movie. Evidently the director figured that having Brad Pitt scowl was hilarious? It's not. Maybe it would have gotten better further into the movie, but I doubt it. You have about 30 minutes to develop my interest in any movie; any longer and I'm apt to pull the plug, which I did here. Why Pitt signed on for this is a mystery.",2,11,22,29 May 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Very disappointing
","What a disappointing movie! Here I'm thinking we're going to see a movie about the 'secret' life of pets and their relationship with their owners, but instead we get some goofy, uninteresting story line about pets that have lost their way. Maybe I'm spoiled by Pixar movies like Nemo that have characters and dialog that appeal to both children and adults? This is definitely a kids movie. Case in point; three quarters of the way through my daughter says 'this movie is not what I expected. Can we leave now?' We left the theatre at that point, and did not even discuss the movie on the way home, which is unusual for us.The trailers for this movie are very misleading. In fact they are the only interesting aspect and they all occur in the first 15 minutes. The movie would have been much better if they had stuck with the 'secret life' theme.It's not a bad movie; just disappointing. Kids 5 and younger will love it. Anyone else......not so much.If you do see it, I would not spend extra to see it in 3D.",2,9,30,9 July 2016
Arrival," Major disappointment
","What a pile of crap. How this movie rates an 8.1 on this site I'll never know. Here I'm thinking I'm going to see some great sci-fi flick, and what I get is a long drawn out drama with an absolutely silly ending. It starts out okay, but then settles into a series of flashbacks that moves at a snails pace. I still have no idea what was going on with Amy Adams' character? And Forest Whitaker plays his usual unintelligible, mumbling self. The story needed far more development. Lets start with a bit more insight into the aliens? What we got was really very little. I was really looking forward to seeing this one. But as it turns out, it was probably the most disappointing movie I've seen in a while.",2,13,24,15 February 2017
Life," Impressive
","I saw this movie today and I must say it was awesome! I love horror/sci-fi movies that take place in space, and this one was top notch; very entertaining and kept my attention throughout. The acting was good as was the pace. There were several plot twists and the ending was great!The alien lifeform, although not as ruthless and nasty as the one in the Alien movies, was equally as lethal, and smart.Again it was very entertaining and we'll worth the price of admission. If you like this genre, you won't be disappointed!",10,16,34,24 March 2017
Annihilation," Confusing, jumbled, mess
","I bought into the hype. I read reviews saying this is the best sci-fi movie ever. It's awesome; you'll be blown away, etc., etc.
That could not be further from the truth. It's very slow moving, and frankly, quite boring. 
Then, you factor in the confusion, and you've got one frustrating mess.
I was very, very disappointed in this one.",2,0,1,3 June 2018
Alien: Covenant," Very entertaining
","Not the best movie ever, but certainly worth a look. The alien special effects were great! The gestation and birth of the alien continues to evolve!There are obviously a lot of holes in the story, and a lot of head scratching decisions by the crew. All have been discussed thoroughly in other reviews. I thought the scenes with David and Walter dragged on too long and added little overall.But I go to such movies to be entertained, not to critique every word and action of the characters, or the intent of the director. All in all, a very good movie that most will enjoy.",7,3,9,20 May 2017
