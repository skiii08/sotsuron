Blade Runner 2049," A Masterpiece of the highest order
","First let me just say that I am not going to spoil any of the plot points of this movie as the director has himself insisted not to and I urge the reviewers to come to respect his wish.Now let me just start by saying the original Blade Runner was one of the most influential sci-fi film to be ever made. Some people may not like it as it is very slow paced and deeply philosophical and I respect their opinion but you cannot deny its legacy. As it so happens Blade Runner 2049 might just fall on the same category. Directed by Denis Villeneuve who directed Incedies, Prisoners(another masterpiece), Arrival, Sicario and Enemy has outdone himself. This is seriously his best film to date. Even though this is a sequel to a movie he wasn't involved in whatsoever he has managed to expand its universe extremely elegantly and marked his directorial trademark in it. I won be surprised if he is put in the same bracket as Kubrick, Spielberg, Tarantino, Scorsese, Eastwood in the coming years. Talking about greatness we have director of photography propelled by Roger Deakins who already had his hands on Shawshawnk Redemption, No Country for Old Men, Skyfall, The Big Lebowski and Fargo to just name a few and to think he has never won an Oscar despite being nominated 13 times. Well this is about to change this year or you cannot ever take Academy seriously because I strongly believe this is his best work. The way he uses color palette is quite remarkable to watch and it might just be one of the best looking film to ever exist. Acting wise Harrison Ford gives one of his performance in a long time. You can just feel he loved working on this film(unlike that reboot on 2015). I have always been a fan of Ryan Gosling since Drive(another Neo-Noir masterpiece) and after watching this I am convinced that he is one of the best actor working today. Jared Leto gives a another stellar performance as expected from an Academy winner. Dave Bautista, Robin Wright, Ana de Armas all are impressive with their given role. Another thing that made the original Blade Runner so iconic was the soundtrack. And with this film it is no exception. Though this has Hans Zimmer Benjamin Wallfisch collaborating it feels a individual work like the first one. What else can I say? No praise is enough for what I just witnessed. This is one of those films that will inspire people to be filmmakers, that will make people realize why we go to cinemas and spent our hard earned cash, that will continue to put cinemas as art forms. Just go to the biggest theater possible and witness an piece of modern art put on by extremely visionary and talented people. You will not regret it. 10/10",10,67,157,4 October 2017
Spider-Man 2," A great drama film which has some comic book elements on it.
","Alright, as with what the other reviewer said, a 7.3 rating for this film is criminally low and I don't understand why this film is not mentioned alongside The Dark Knight and Richard Donner's Superman as the greatest comic book film of all time. Some might even put this on the top and it is hard to argue.To sum it in simple term, this film has absolutely everything. Great fight sequence, awesome CGI and practical effects, amazing soundtrack, pitch perfect story, very well written protagonist and antagonist and hell even the cheesy sequence works because of Raimi's direction. But most of all what this has that other comic book film today try and fail is to have a heart. And this film has a lot of them. Take a example of that train sequence, while most CBM will might focus on good action on that scene , this film puts Peter's motivation and his conflicts before. Also the love story between Peter and MJ works so well because it is directly connected with the main plot of the film and it executes it perfectly till the very end.While there have been many spider man film after this, nothing has been able to top it because nothing has been written as better than this film. It is that simple. The amazing actions and Raimi's use of real effects instead of using CG is just a cherry on top. SM 2 has aged like a fine wine and people should have no problem when it is mentioned as the greatest comic book film ever made.",10,2,7,3 July 2019
Midsommar," Style over substance
","It started really strong and I was beginning to get invested a lot. Especially due to the visuals and cinematography which was top notch. But the characters were so dumb and poorly written that it made no sense by the end about what the director vision was? Was he telling that cult is bad because pretty sure murdering 8 people while drugging them is not supposed to be enticing. Was he trying to say that anxiety or heartbreak can be overcome by joining a cult and burning your boyfriend alive? Yeah you can say he dint treat her right but the only worst thing I saw him do to her was miss her birthday. I couldn't understand the point of Dani's character. She is not a sociopath at the start but apparently dancing around with a group of women and being made a queen is all it takes. I also understand the she got a family in the end but even then this film is so self indulgent for the ending that it made no sense. Very poorly executed storyline. And the boys in this film are just a bunch of morons. They are just a plot point director uses to show how masculinity is bad and will get you killed while he glorifies a cult of people who have no hesitant in killing people. And never mind Pelle who is supposed to be the nice guy in the movie who brings his friends knowing they will get sacrificed has the most happy ending. Overall I dont get what the director thought when he wrote this film. I mean sure it has some amazing work camera and visual works but it genuinely feels like sadistic film with no real characters. Not saying you can't make a good film with that, just look at Shining. But like Kubrick you need to execute it perfectly or else you have a film with no real substance which unfortunately this film is.",3,4,7,29 September 2019
Joker," Theater clapped at the end for a super-villain who was not even likable like other superheroes. This is the power of true cinema
","Amidst all the propaganda this film is facing from the media this is without a doubt one of the best character driven film ever done. Everything in this film ooze great film making. Cinematography is drop dead gorgeous, sound track is hauntingly beautiful, directing wise Todd Philips has outdone himself, characters are extremely realistic, Gotham has never been this well shot and made and of course the acting. Holy hell it was good. Now before I get into the the obvious choice, I just want to bring Robert Di Niro who I thought was absolutely amazing in his role with such a little time given. With that said it is Joaquin Phoenix is what makes this film. I have seen most of his film from The master to the gladiator. And with this film he has cemented as one of the best actor to grace the screen. He is absolutely hypnotic in the role that you began to cheer for him. At the end when the credits role this film will make you think for better or for worst. And I think that is what film should do. That's the power of art.",9,1,1,5 October 2019

Parasite," A film that manages to interrogate the choices every class makes while delivering a roller coaster of emotions for the audience
","I will just say this first. If you are planning to watch this film, stop right here and watch it now before reading anything regarding this film because trust me you want to watch this without knowing anything not even the synonyms.Now, directed by Joon-ho Bong who also directed Memories of Murder and Snowpiercer, Parasite is a dark comedy thriller which mixes various other genre. Its really hard to describe this film. I would compare this with Quentin Taratino films like the title suggests. But even then this film has a lot of direct message to audience and themes which is very easy to notice. That aside Joon-ho Bong has also upped his game in terms of the structure and storytelling. So much so that at first viewing you won't notice the hidden details and metaphors this film presents. The name 'parasite' is just one of them. At the end you will be thinking who the real parasites are. Is it the rich, the poor, their expendable need for a better living or the house itself? Acting wise I dint see a single false note by any actors. The main standout was of course the father played brilliantly by Kang-ho Song. Writing is however what makes this film so great. You can see when the director wrote this film he thought of everything. There is not a single loop hole. Every character choices make sense, everything falls into place even when it seems to bizarre yet it seems so completely realistic just because just how we got to that point.There is so much this film tries to say and you can see the director succeeded it gloriously when you think about it. The social structure with the way we live, our understanding and psychology at looking at people who live differently, our priorities and what we value. Joon-Ho Bong makes sure viewers will think after each act is completed and make your own judgement of what happened. He has completely turned a genre on its head. A film about social class has never been made like this before.Still, this film may not please to people who just want a happy ending feel good movie. Without spoiling anything till now I will say that the first half is completely different to the second half. If you are the type of person who can handle violence and shock in a film then I will recommend this for you. If you are the person who want something different and original other than what hollywood keeps throwing these days I will recommend this for you. If you think film are not just for entertainment but for the art itself I will recommend this for you. Film industry need to keep investing on visionary directors like Bong Zoon-Ho and you might just get a masterpiece like this once in a while.",10,18,28,18 September 2019
Green Book," A movie that hits every note right
","I am gonna be short and sweet here. This is a fantastic film especially in today's context where people are using race bait to profit themselves. No doubt the academy got right with this one. The two leads are absolutely amazing in their roles where they perfectly complement the story playing a opposing nature to one another, every side characters are there to move the story forward and not just shoehorned. Editing is breathtakingly beautiful, script holds perfectly tightly til the very end(even when the credits role), cinematography is top notch, music fits the tone of the film very neatly. I tried real hard to nitpick few flaws with this one but its just not there. This is a great hybrid of road trip comedy and biographic drama. Applause yourselves whoever have been involved with this gem because this is how you use real race issue and its history in a film.",10,1,5,28 February 2019
