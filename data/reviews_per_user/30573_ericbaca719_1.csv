Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Better Than the Last
","When my supervisor at Dish said that the next Sherlock Holmes movie was out on DVD I knew I had to watch it. I have been reading the books since I was a child and had always wondered how they would include Holmes' amazing intellectual insights without using a narrator. They did an amazing job of it. Sometimes these amazing leaps of mental agility would be stated plainly, or stated as if it were very plain to Holmes rather. On other occasions they would actually slow time down and go through, step by step, what was going through the mind of Holmes, which was just as good if not better than the former. I would have loved to buy this movie but since I couldn't afford to I rented it with my Blockbuster at Home subscription. Since then, I have watched it about three times total now. It is a must see. Even if you cant afford to buy it outright, you need to see this move.",9,1,2,28 August 2012
