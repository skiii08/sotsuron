The Mask," Carrey's comic masterpiece
","It would go without saying that this is one of Jim Carrey's most memorable movies, and with just that in mind, it makes sense that so many people like this.There's a lot to enjoy about this movie: the movie itself is good and doesn't take itself too seriously, (the largest indicator of this being that there are several cartoon references and likenesses) and while being full of action, it's also quite funny.The story is enjoyable and comes to a decisive end... but I won't spoil it for anybody who hasn't seen it. (Yeah, like anyone hasn't.) The fact that it was nominated for a Razzie doesn't matter; many people like surreal movies, and this is truly one of the best... if not the definitive best.10/10",10,0,0,30 September 2007
The Sound of Music," This movie is timeless!
","We've been watching this for three days in English class, and I remember and love every bit of it! I don't even know where to start, this film is just such an enjoyable classic, that I'll probably be watching it in my house for quite some time!
I like every bit of it, even the musical numbers just send me back to my younger years. This movie is worthy of a 10!",Null,0,6,10 December 2003
The Longest Yard," It may be a remake, but it was done very well.
","First off, I normally hate football, (don't ask why.) but this movie is actually pretty cool.Adam Sandler gave one of his best performances since Happy Gillmore and that's a plus. And let's not forget Chris Rock: every one of his movies I've seen before this was really painful to watch, but this redeems him.Of course, if you're also a wrestling fan like me, you'll automatically notice some fan favorites right off the bat. (Stone Cold, Great Khali and Goldberg) Not to say that I like football now, but even if you don't, you're going to love this movie.",8,2,7,30 May 2005
The Big Lebowski," Everyone should see this.
","Even if you've never been into this genre, or movies directed by the Coen Brothers, there's no denying that this movie is a must-see for everybody.Now, some would argue that in order to fully understand and enjoy this film you'd have to be stoned, but even if you're completely sober you're still going to find this funny in some aspect; I should know, I watched this at least 10 times and it is hilarious! Not only is this movie funny, but it's also very quotable. I challenge anyone to find a person that can't quote one portion of the movie and have someone else know what they're talking about. It's THAT quotable.Now for the verdict: The Big Lebowski gets a 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,5 June 2009
Happy Gilmore," Golf doesn't get any funnier
","Aside from Caddyshack, I don't think that a golf movie has ever made me laugh as hard as I did when this came out, and that's saying something.Contrary to what the DVR may say about this movie, it's actually worth watching all the way to the end; it's one of those movies where you don't have to think too hard to appreciate it.Admittedly, all the networks that play this edited don't do it justice; Of course, that's the case with most movies on network TV. Stay away from them.If I could mention any flaws with this movie, it'd be what I just mentioned above. Other than that, this was a very well-made movie.9/10",9,1,2,30 March 2009
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Not funny.
","A long time ago, when this movie first came out, I actually liked it... of course, that was BEFORE I realized that making good movies requires a lot more than just swearing at other members of the cast for an hour and a half. I offer you this bit of advice: Don't waste your money on the DVD or VHS of this piece of garbage. By the way, I find it hard to believe that this trash almost won an Oscar for Best Song. (Thank God that never happened.) The fact is, I'm even surprised that it was never nominated for a Razzie!1/10 (PS, if anyone tells you that this is a 'great movie,' they're lying!)",Null,0,1,19 August 2004
Spider-Man 2," Impressive as always
","Being an avid Spider-fan, I took a liking to this movie without question.This time around, the subject matter is totally different; it deals more with the choices we make and what true heroism is: giving up what we want most in exchange for something much more important.The fight scenes were, in their own right, pretty good. Unfortunately, they can never outshine the scenes of their predecessor, so I shave a few points off for that.In the end, I think this movie alone can teach all of us about the lost concept of self-sacrifice and at the same time, give us all an excellent movie-watching experience.8/10",8,0,1,18 October 2008
Superbad," 'Bad' is good!
","At first glance, I admit that I thought this movie was going to suck royally last year... it's a good thing I have an open mind.This is the way that a good sex comedy should be made. It's touching enough to be remembered, yet funny enough so that regular folks will want to see it over and over. It's practically a coming-of-age novel right on screen.It's rare that a movie with a script so experimental could capture the attention of so many. For that, this movie should be among the most legendary movies of all time.Now for the verdict: 10 out of 10!",10,3,7,16 June 2008
Spider-Man 3," Good, but for Spidey fans, kind of predictable
","I just saw this movie just this morning, and speaking as a true Spider-fan, I can say that it was good, but just like spider sense, I sort of saw things coming.I can't understand why people trash this movie so much. The fight scenes were fun to watch, the dialog was OK, and I have to say that the whole revenge theme kind of stood out... these movies have a way of teaching a little something to the audience without talking down to them, and that's part of why I like them so much.And last year when everyone had a fit with the eight-second flag shot, I don't know what the problem was, but it certainly had no effect on me.All in all, this is a pretty decent movie. You'll like it.8/10",8,1,2,22 September 2008
Corpse Bride," Beautiful!
","I normally wouldn't take a liking to Tim Burton films, (save for The Nightmare Before Christmas) but I just recently saw this movie today... it was a movie that everyone should see.Mr. Burton is a master at taking a dark subject like 'cold feet' before a wedding day and managing to turn it into something positive.The movie was visually and comically appealing, and it really gave me a warm feeling when I saw everybody's departed other halves returning. Victor did what was right: he lifted Emily's burden by symbolically reuniting her with her own mate, albeit Barkis was a terrible man, but it was the right thing to do.After seeing this movie, I thought to myself that my ideals were very correct: in both life and death, there's no stronger force than love.10/10",10,4,9,24 September 2005
American Pie," Vomit-inducing
","I'm not a movie snob in any sense of the word, but I can tell when I see an awful movie.To start off, the first time I saw this movie, it wasn't even my idea... it was my father's insinuation that I wanted to see it.How anyone can like this movie is beyond me: the plot is highly unoriginal, Just looking at half of the cast makes me want to vomit violently, and the 'dialogue' sounds like a foul-mouthed 14-year old wrote it.If you want an intelligent movie with actual laughs, watch anything BUT this.0/10",1,24,57,9 February 2007
Disturbia," It's different... the good kind of different.
","For once, this is a thriller that doesn't try to completely engulf the audience in fear.I actually enjoyed watching this with a friend of mine. It had a story and wasn't just gore for gore's sake. This movie actually takes a break from the creepy elements of the film and at points gave the film some funny elements too.In the end, it was nice to see this movie finish on a good note, because there are too many movies like this with the hero getting slaughtered.I'd definitely recommend it to any fan of the genre.10/10",10,1,5,18 May 2007
Van Helsing," This sucked!
","I was set out to prove my local radio station wrong... I should have stuck with what they said. I originally thought it would be a halfway decent monster beat-down... however it was nothing more than CGI all around. I went with my dad and one of my friends (Both separately) and I got the same reaction... I had to get out of the theater before I died from boredomThis movie does less for the mind, and more for the sphincter.In closing, I say to you: Stay away from this one! 1/10 By the way, I think you all could learn from me... listen to your radio station when they say a movie's bad.",1,0,1,4 July 2004
Dreamgirls," I'm just sorry.
","I hate to seem like a snob, but I really misjudged this movie.I really did try to watch and enjoy this movie all the way through, but with all the singing, it played out more like an operetta than a musical... not that there's anything wrong with that, but I expected more.There was less dialog than I thought there would be, and that really bothered me.Also, this seemed reminiscent of a Supremes biopic. It would have done better if it were a little more original.I just have to apologize for what I'm about to do.I'm sorry, but this movie is hit with a 4 out of 10.",4,1,4,4 May 2007
Flashdance," A movie with a great message
","I really can't say why I saw this movie, but I saw it for all the right reasons. To be honest, Jenifer Beals gave a great performance. She exemplifies what it means to have drive! It may not be the best, but if you think about it, there's a message in this movie: never give out on your dream! After watching this, that's been my mindset ever since!Thank you, Flashdance!This is worthy of an 9 out of 10. By the way: any kind of movie snob who bashes this movie obviously has no drive.",8,1,4,8 June 2003
Mamma Mia!," Oscar-worthy
","Musicals have always been a favorite of mine: from 'Chicago' to 'The Sound of Music,' I've never been one to dismiss seeing one.This light-hearted little gem of a movie looked very promising in previews and didn't disappoint on screen. The cast couldn't have been chosen better, even knowing that the critics had their say; saying that it was a 'muddled performance.' (Whatever that was supposed to mean.) There was the little matter of who originally fathered Sophie, but other than that minor hitch in the plot line, I think this movie more than lived up to its Broadway counterpart.I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,19 July 2008
Batman Begins," It could have been better.
","As much as I like a good Batman film, this one wasn't really the best one made.I was able to spot several problems with this movie, and I'll be more than happy to point them out.The first of many was that they put too much emphasis on modernizing Batman: if you're going to deal with a classic character, you must think classic. The tank-looking bat-mobile... need I say more? Secondly, Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow's origin was never discussed, thus leaving people that don't know about the legend clueless.Also, the continual mentioning of the city's water supply and the neurotoxic gas was slightly annoying.Finally, the one element that they forgot was the one thing that Tim Burton nailed dead-on: humor! There was no shred of humor to keep this thing together. Even Forrest Gump was a drama, but it managed to be funny too; this on the other hand, took itself way too seriously.To finalize, for Batman fans everywhere, this isn't really one that I'd recommend.",2,7,20,17 June 2005
Twilight," The movie outdoes the books!
","First, let me just say that for the longest time I've had the biggest vampire fixation, and even knowing that the books sort of left me cold, there was practically no way to stop me from seeing this movie.I was even skeptical to bring my friend along to see it, but in any case, we did and we loved it! The plot translated very well to screen, (I loved the baseball scene.) the effects were decent, and the fight scene between Edward and James kept me in suspense. (Sorry to all you fan-girls out there, but it has to be said: in a stunning upset, the movie was better than the book.) The cast choice was interesting. The look of the characters actually surprised me; that goes double for Carlisle; he looked younger than I had pictured.As always, the romantic aspect was a draw to me. I think we can all relate to Bella's situation: wanting someone that could possibly be harmful to us.the only disappointment I can name is that the ending didn't exactly match up. Didn't Edward leave Bella in the first book? Anyway, on with my verdict. I give Twilight a 9 out of 10.",9,3,13,22 November 2008
School of Rock," Tune in, and rock out!
","To put it as simply as I can, this movie totally, well... rocked! What else can you say about a movie that has such an excellent message, ('Don't let people steamroll over your ambitions') but also is totally funny in its own right? It makes total sense that Jack Black would do this kind of movie. There's a reason this movie was made... it was made for laughs, and to illustrate a point that's totally obvious.One thing's for sure, though: there's a difference between being 'da man,' and being 'THE man.' If you didn't enjoy this movie, guess which one you are.10/10",10,0,1,10 December 2006
Dumb and Dumber," A movie you can enjoy no matter your IQ
","For years, this movie has been one of the funniest Jim Carrey movies ever.This movie is proof that sometimes you just need something dumb to be entertained and that even the smartest of us can't help but love stupidity with their comedy.I think what makes it so memorable was the fact that there were so many quotable lines and probably just for the simple fact that one of the best actors of our time is in it.I can't really say that there was anything wrong with the movie, but I do wish they hadn't made that dreadful sequel.8/10",8,0,1,15 October 2006
Detroit Rock City," This shows just how far metal-heads will go for a good concert.
","I've known a lot of people like the members of the fictitious MATMOK that'd label bands like KISS as 'demonic,' and every one of them are all insane.This movie is not for them.This movie is, however, for all of us that will go through absolute hell to see a killer concert, but this movie isn't just about the music; it's about being able to put your foot down and say, 'if you don't like the stuff I do, you can just eat it!' Now, I'm no psychiatrist, but if I were, I'd say that Jam's mother had some repressed sexual desires. Did you see how she practically ate that priest's hand when she tried to kiss it out of respect? In any case, this movie is perfect for the rebellious rocker in all of us.",10,1,1,10 April 2009
Step Up," Makes you wanna get up and shake it!
","I saw the previews for this movie a month before, and I was immediately impressed.I know that many of you are saying that the plot is reminiscent of 'Save the Last Dance,' but try looking at it another way: this movie is telling the viewers that if you want something bad enough, you've got to get in there and do whatever it takes to get it.The soundtrack almost makes you want to get out of your seat and flow with the music... I almost did.It's hard to say exactly what this movie's flaws are; either way, this was worthy of it's hype.8/10",8,7,22,11 August 2006
The Breakfast Club," A Brat Pack classic
","There are those of you who have a hard time understanding this movie, and I can't really understand how that is when this is a film that many have a hard time switching off.You see, it's not only a great drama; a tale of teen angst if you will... this is also a classic 80's cult film.Now, according to my knowledge, cult films have withstood the test of time very well. The reason this one in particular is up there with the likes of 16 Candles, Weird Science, and Say Anything (by the way, I'm aware that Say Anything was not a Brat Pack movie) is because it shows that those perceived as one type of person are really just trying to find their real self... that's the basis of this movie: finding oneself.I know I said that this was a drama, but all great dramas have humor in them... this is one of them.Everybody has their favorite scene or line. Mine just happens to be a bunch of separate scenes... when everyone reveals why they're in detention.All who have never seen this movie, please do yourself a favor and see it.9/10",8,1,2,19 October 2006
The Wedding Singer," Some of Adam Sandler's best work since I don't know when.
","I don't care how many times I've seen this movie. It's still one of the greatest, albeit oft-played, films Adam Sandler has ever been in.Unlike most Adam Sandler movies, he doesn't have to rely on his character being goofy. The rest of the cast does that well enough... that's part of the appeal of this movie.The main reason I can honestly say why people like this movie (especially me) is because it has humor and an element of romance as well... let's also not forget that this was set in 1985; that gives the cast an excuse to dress like a flashback.The best part about the movie is that it wasn't inconclusive, negative or too sexually driven.I totally recommend this movie.10/10",10,3,5,25 November 2006
The Simpsons Movie," Preachy and boring
","Let me just come right out and say it: this movie was terrible.Homer was right to point out that I could just as easily watch this on TV for free... unfortunately, at the request of my friends, I just went with them to see this and I just couldn't take it.It was just painful to sit through and outright mocking of people being people, and Lisa going on about the environment. I want to help keep the world inhabitable too, but I'm not going to push it on people like some Al Gore clone.All I can say now is that I want my money and my 87 minutes back.1/10",1,6,14,4 November 2007
Dodgeball," Just as good as I thought it would be.
","This is one of those rare movies that I predict will be good.How can I possibly choose a favorite part? it was really well-done... especially the '5 Rules.' This movie kind of gives me, and virtually everyone in this day and age new hope! This is a welcome change from all the crap I'm used to seeing.This movie is a 9 at best... 'cause I love a good goofball comedy now and then. I encourage all who haven't seen this to take a look at it.",Null,0,0,24 June 2004
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Horrid
","I watched this last night with my sister and her fiancÃ©e, and it's true what they say: 'Great minds think alike.' My sister and I hated it.I may live in Texas, but I'm not as intolerant as Will Ferell's character; I'm practically offended.Let me just say that there was nothing redeemable about this movie. It was just pure stupidity with more of the same thrown in for good measure.It, along with 'Reality Bites,' should be driven out to the middle of the desert and buried... it's that bad.0/10",1,2,5,10 September 2008
