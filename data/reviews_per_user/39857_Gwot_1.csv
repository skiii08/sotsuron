The Blair Witch Project," A milestone in the horror movie genre, brilliance by the 'less is more' theory.
","Similar to 1963s 'The Haunting', the disturbing nature of this film is brought on solely by the power of suggestion.  The mind will always surpass what can be shown on the screen, the less that is spelled out for us in fake blood, the more our minds fill in with our own twisted personalised psyches. To further engage the audience, the entire movie is made from the only remains of the victims, the film in their camera that was found a year after their disappearance.  In the noir tradition, we know that they're doomed and we're going with them, to our deaths, living out a campfire story, helpless.",Null,1,2,22 June 1999
