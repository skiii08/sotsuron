The Avengers," Be ready for a HULK sized experience.
","I've waited with baited breathe to see this movie for 4 years, ever since Sam Jackson turned up at the end of Iron Man in 2008 and uttered those words that made Marvel fans around the world weep happy tears: 'I'm here to talk about the Avengers initiative'. After 5 films I can happily report that my incredibly high expectations were not even close to high enough.The movie starts off with an introduction to each of our heroes and their antagonist: Loki. It's all pretty usual stuff from here. But once the heroes come together, the movie becomes something more. There are a lot of big egos flying around and each one is more used to being the centre of attention, especially Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. It's in these heated rows and witty banter that The Avengers becomes something that I really wasn't expecting: a family comedy. All these characters are so different and come from such different backgrounds that there is a lot of fun to be had by bouncing them off each other. The fish out of water gags at Captain America's and Thor's expense are great ('Easy there Point Break') with Tony getting to roll off line after line of witty insults. And in the film's climax, Hulk gets most of the laughs as he smashes everything around him. The Hulk could easily have been the film's main weakness, Marvel had already tried bringing him to the screen twice with little success (Ang Lee's 2003 version being one of the most underrated superhero movies ever) but he ends up being one of the film's biggest strengths. Mark Ruffalo makes a great Bruce Banner as he actually gets to play both Banner and the Hulk through motion/performance capture (the first time ever that an actor has played both Banner and his massive alter-ego) and it works SUPER well. There was a huge cheer and applause when Chris Evans delivered the line: 'Hulk, SMASH!' and Hulk proceeded to do so with much gusto.A few of the new characters and ones that were limited to cameos in previous films get their chance to shine here. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow gets to do more kicking (looking good doing it) and is given a love interest in Jeremy Renner's unbelievably bad-ass Hawkeye. Samuel L Jackson finally gets to spend more than 5 minutes on screen after showing up in 4 Marvel movies prior to this one as a part of his massive 9 picture deal with Marvel. Cobie Smulders (one can not measure her sex appeal) of How I Met Your Mother fame gets to show off her action chops as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Maria Hill and the Stan Lee cameo is present of course.Which brings us to the film's action sequences. They are astounding.Like Transformers 3 astounding. Each one better than the last. An early 3 player bout involving Iron Man and Captain America try to take down Thor is great, but an aerial fight between Thor and the Hulk is better. But then there's the climactic 'glorious war!' which really shows the potential of bringing this group together as they get to fight as a team. The problem with them on their own as demonstrated in previous movies, is that the film makers are limited to the adversaries to give their hero. Iron Man has just been fighting other men in suits, Thor monsters, etc. But now you can throw any enemies you want at The Avengers.The plot is relatively tight and clever, but the screenplay is the real hero; brilliantly written with some cracking dialog. Joss Whedon's directorial style translates perfectly into the blockbuster mold. The perfectly cast actors are all 100% comfortable in their roles and have great fun both bouncing off each other and uniting to fight as a team. The action sequences are breathtaking and the whole movie is terrific fun without being dumb or 'kiddy' (Richie). In terms of where it stands in the pantheon of great comic book movies is strictly down to personal preference. But in my opinion this is the second best comic book movie ever (The Dark Knight wins out due to it's better story and villain) but is still one of the best action movies ever made.My one BIG problem with the film was the untimely murder of Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) at the hands of a rampaging Loki. I felt like this was merely a tool to evoke an emotional response (adding to his character arc) from Tony Stark, whom throughout the film mentions numerous times he wasn't even aware that Agent Coulson had a first name, but all of a sudden feels as though he had some kind of relationship with this character? I have LOVED every scene Agent Coulson has ever been involved in and I feel it was a large mistake to kill off one of the only genuinely relatable and funny human characters in the entire Marvel Universe. Perhaps in further films he will make a reappearance to collect his vintage Captain America collectible cards. One can only hope.Make sure you stay after the credits also, for those of you not in the know... be ready to google 'Thanos' and the 'Infinity Gauntlet' when you get home.All in all it was GREAT fun & I honestly can not wait for Whedon's Directors's Cut. A fun fact i read this afternoon involves Kevin Feige (Producer of every MARVEL film) already having plans to incorporate Spiderman and the X-men into future Avengers films, once they regain the film rights to these characters.REALLY looking forward to more Avengers. Fingers crossed Joss Whedon keeps his diary empty for many, many years to come.9/10 Well and truly Assembled.",10,15,31,25 April 2012
Black Swan," They were right, DARK AND NIGHTMARISH !
","Dear oh Dear! Darren Aronofsky you sly dog you. Took one of the most promising actresses in the world, wrote a god awful script, shot it in a room with no lights and a 1999 hand-held jvc camorder, added some dodgy CGI, and now your going to win 5 bloody Oscars! This movie is the worst I've seen since TRON:LEGACY unfortunately 'gifted' our local screens. As stated above, i have no love for this film. Don't get me wrong, Natalie Portman and her supporting cast were awesome, kudos to them.. BUT whats with the HUGE lack of dialog. I get that the director wanted the audience to interpret all the pretty dancing and awkward sex deprived Portman moments in our own way, but honestly THIS WAS A JOKE! SHoddy camera work, shoddy lighting, shoddy production. The score was the only thing thing that kept me half interested in what was going on up on the screen. I was originally incredibly excited to hear that MR Aronofky was set to helm he new 'wolverine' movie, but, after paying 11 bucks to watch this??? Not so much. Mila Kunis is wasted, as i feel is Winona Rider, the whole crazy bitch thing has been done numerous times, see 'GOTHIKA' with Halle (black catwoman WTF) Berry or Leo Dicaprio in that Scorsese movie that made not much money. I would honestly have given this 0 if i were able. Sad that this will probably get best Picture over films as great and ORIGINAL as Social Network or THE KINGS SPEECH. Strongly do not recommend!",1,3,10,30 January 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Ignore the hate; Herge would be VERY proud!
","WETA Performance capture technology+ Spielberg +Peter Jackson +Andy Serkis= PWFFFOOAAARRRRRRR!!!!!! Walked out of the cinema TOTALLY sold on performance capture! The visuals PJ & Steve were able to pull off in this film are unmatched. By anything. Ever. An absolute 'have to see it to believe it' moment for cinema goers. Having seasoned motion capture actor Andy Serkis (Gollum, King Kong, Caesar) on board would have been a big help i'm sure... Great story, great pacing, great score, great drama, great action.... The best adventure story since 'Raiders of the Lost ark' all those years ago. Just go see it... Now.. Why are you still reading? GO NOW! 'Whats that Snowy?'",10,1,3,18 March 2012
21 Jump Street," No respect for the original, but funny all the same....
","Attended a screening of 21 Jump Street last night, wasn't blown away but it was still just as fun and enjoyable as you'd expect something starring Channing Tatum & Jonah Hill as undercover police officers. Firstly, if you can, AVOID ANY AND ALL trailers for this film.... basically every comedic moment from act 1 was covered in these 30 seconds trailers; causing me to already know the jokes and plot points that were upcoming in the next 20-30 minutes. During the set up for act 2, i found it a little hard to get into the story because i felt like id kinda been left out of the loop for that first act. Once you're in though, well you're absolutely in for a fun ride. If you're familiar with Jonah Hill's previous works (previous to Moneyball) you'll understand exactly what you're in for. Channing Tatum was the BIG surprise for me during this film. Not only did he show the audience a completely different (vulnerable,flawwed) spectrum of his acting range, but he was actually funny as hell too, the back and forth banter between Hill & Tatum MADE the movie and is ever so believable. Obviously filmed with an R18+ rating in mind, its a little disappointing as an Australian audience that we were given a watered down MA15+ version of the American cut,although the R18+ version gives me something to look forward to watching when released internationally on DVD and Blu-ray. Watch out for the Johnny Depp cameo in Act 3 too; a nice nod to the original 21 Jump Street TV series that ever so quickly lets the audience know that THAT series is well and truly finished, and that Jonah and Channing 'got this'. No 'Superbad' or 'Easy A' but definitely on the same path. Looking forward to the sequel immensely; although what would they call it? 21 Jump Street 2? 22 Jump Street? I guess we'll find out in 2014.",7,1,6,18 March 2012
Kung Fu Panda 2," The return of Awesomeness INDEED!
","WOW. Thats the only word i uttered during my KUNG FU PANDA 2 experience, Im confident that you will be the same. The visuals are unparallelled, the story is as touching as Toy Story 3 and the main character every bit as lovable as he was in his first outing. Jack Black returns to the role I'm sure will be what he will always be remembered for, Po the Panda. The all star voice cast is by the far the highlight, with everyone involved being given the chance to have a bit more fun with their respective characters. The story, to which i wont go into too much detail, follows Po on his journey for inner peace, and to take down evil Peacock, LORD SHEN. Comedy ensues, as does (quite surprisingly) a whole lot of heart and the best animated fight scenes to date. Loved everything about this movie. Highly recommended. 9/10",9,0,0,21 June 2011
Cars 2," Pixar deserves a lap of honour! 12 straight hits!
","Let me start out by saying this in no way is a movie for children. Animation is considered an art form, my father in law believes it to be nothing more than kids movies. How wrong is he? You'll know the answer after walking out of Cars 2 with a smile on your face. All the lovable characters from the first movie return, with bigger roles along with a few fresh new faces. We say goodbye to dear old Radiator Springs pretty early on, but hello to rest of the world. Lightning McQueen is invited to take art in the WORLD GRAND PRIX, run by a Billionaire Jeep that has created an alternative fuel to replace gas. Fun ensues. With the leap in technology since the first film, Pixar brings even further into the movie by using incredible point of view shots from inside the car and next to it, you can really feel how fast the cars are travelling. I would love to see the networks stacks Pixar uses to render the countries used in this movie because WOW are they pretty. We see France, Italy, Japan; its all so pretty. The Story of Cars 2 cruises at a good pace, introducing all the important players from the start. Michael Cain here as Finn MacMissile is great, easily the best part of the movie. The action is heart pounding and the heart that Mater brings to this action movie is a tremendous object to balance the film. I wont go too far into the story line, just know that this is more Jason Bourne or Daniel Craig's James Bond than it is anything else. Gritty, cartoonishly violent and over the top. The visuals here are insane and the story (as Pixar's always done) has hugely deep under currents all the way through it, from death and extortion, to gambling, match fixing, deceit and the race to find a greener way for human kind to exist. Im so glad Pixar is taking steps toward more openly adult films, hopefully the can shrug the childish stigma attached to them.I look more and more forward to their next epic 'BRAVE'. If its half as good as CARS 2, they wont have to worry about unlucky 13.Also, seeing Buzz and Woody on screen again during their short at the beginning of the film mad it more than worth the $10 ticket.8/10 Not their best, but still leaps and bounds ahead of any other animation studios out there,",8,2,5,26 June 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," incredibly enjoyable film, in the vein of Inception and Blade Runner
","I was lucky enough to see this film recently with a few of my more intellectual friends.I wasn't really sure about this film; having nearly had an overdose of Matt Damon recently as he popped up in every movie pre Oscars bar Black Swan. (or so it felt) Same with Emily Blunt, although it was Jack Blacks horrendous Gulliver's Travels that she decided to be a part of recently. Upon taking my seat and sitting through the ritual advertisements that now litter our once sacred movie previews section, I was surprised at the fast paced film opening. Catching the cinema goers off guard al a Blade Runner, is an art i had seldom seen used for years until The Social Network turned up last year. How is it that yet another Phillip K. Dick novella has been adapted so incredibly? and into one of the best films this year will deliver mind you. Matt Damon is SPOT ON! Playing New Yorks youngest ever Senator, his performance is dark and troubled, yet incredibly powerful and fragile. 'Chance' brings around the meeting between Damon's 'David' and Emily Blunt's 'Elise'. It is here the story gets interesting. A man is assigned by 'The Adjustment Bureau' to ensure David's destiny is carried out the way 'the Plan' has it.The plan being God's (The Chairman) overall outlook on how things should unfold, something he changes throughout the movie on numerous occasions. What they didn't count on was this 'adjuster', having an untimely nap the exact moment he was supposed to stop David from meeting Elise; and keeping the new plan, on track.What unfolds from here is part sci-fi, part philosophical, part thriller and part action. A movie with a lot of bite and a whole lot of heart. Damon and Blunt are spectacular as the two lovers torn apart by 'The Chairmans' plan, fighting for their own free will to be together!!!A spectacular turn from Terrence Stamp is the cherry on top of what is no doubt a brilliant film. The score winds everything together while the film comes to a very confusing head.I have read numerous reviews and threads all in conversation as to the films end. I wont ruin it, BUT, the people whom do not understand the films end, need to watch it again. There is a very strong metaphor in there, you'll just need to look a little harder.Fantastic film, if you enjoyed Blade Runner (any real movie-goer will) or Nolan's instant classic Inception, you will fall in love with this movie.Phillip K. Dick. I love you.",9,1,1,14 March 2011
Super 8," Abrams does Spielberg. With the help of Spielberg
","OK. So im gonna let you all know right now. This is easily in my top 10 movies of all time. A group that includes The Shawshank redemption and The Dark Knight, Pretty good company huh? JJ. Abrams, whom until Start Trek in 09' had slipped under my radar, has created a movie with the look and feel of all the 80's Spielberg classics, without losing his own voice as the director. People that complain about the slow decline in movie magic this past decade with trash like TRON:LEGACY,BLACK SWAN & THE SAW SERIES will rejoice in the news that this is as awe inspiring, scary, heart warming and adrenaline fuelled as all your favourites, some it even out does. The sheer class of the production is incredible, the way the director has made you feel every bit as involved in the aspiring love interest betweem the two young main characters and the importance of unravelling the mystery surrounding the strange occurrences in the small town in Ohio, is a triumph in every respect of the word. The characters, of which there are a lot, all have their own back stories and character arcs, are made as human in this film as any in the past. The cast in this movie is incredible, especially Elle Fanning, good luck keeping your eyes off her in every single frame she is in! Super 8 is the reason the clichéd 'you'll laugh, you'll cry' slogan was created to help decribe the emotions you will feel on this 'hell of a ride'. Easily one of the best films in decades, ill be rewatching this one a few times. Be sure to stay for the credits. 10/10 'The reason i love cinema'!",10,2,6,21 June 2011
Rio," Meh....not bad, but not Toy Story 3
","Well..... where do i begin? Im an avid fan of anything to do with animated films, i honestly believe we will one day soon be seeing a troop of animators and voice actors walking onto the stage at the academy awards, accepting the Oscar for best picture; unfortunately RIO isn't that film. Not to say i didn't enjoy myself, I did. The scenery was absolutely stunning and in 3D!!! (IM DROOLING!) The character animation was spectacular and the characters themselves were all brilliantly voiced and varied.The story follows Blu, a blue Macaw bereft of his childhood (chickhood?) when he falls from his nest during the films wildly fun opening song and dance sequence. He is snatched up by poachers and sent on a plane to America. The story takes a quick turn for the adorable here when the crate containing Blu falls from the smugglers truck only to be discovered by a brilliantly animated little girl. The story zooms forward a good few years and Blu has adapted to his living with humans and is quiet comfortable how his life is set up . Blu; voiced by Jesse Eisenberg, due to his altered lifestyle, has never learned how to fly, thus adapting to use different modes of transport like toy cars and things hanging from the ceiling. (This is important as it is the catalyst for one of the last scenes and multiple physical comedic parts throughout)This is basically the only thing Blu has to overcome throughout the entire movie to complete his character arc. He is shipped off to Rio (along with his owner and Best friend; voiced by Leslie Mann) to save his rare Blu Macaw heritage by planting his seed and ensuring the survival of his kind. There is a love interest thrust upon us, with the only other surviving Blue Macaw Jewel (voiced by Cat-women elect Anne Hathaway, a very clichéd love story in sadly an underwritten part.) As well as love interest between the two main human characters; to balance all the bird love i guess?A new best friend is introduced, a Toucan who's name i cant even remember (it's voiced by George Lopez), who is supposed to be Blu's guide to Rio and kind of a love mentor. ( He has like 14 kids or something and never wants to stay home with them, yeah great message to kids that one!). Two hideously annoying song birds (only wasted vocals of Will.I.AM and Jamie Foxx) and a cockatoo named Nigel that is the most clichéd bad guy (bird?) on EARTH!The visuals saved this movie, as did the heart. Even while i was been distracted by all the floats at Rio's Carnival, the Bird suits, the Jamaican bird smuggler with his 2 overly gay companions (whom they explained nothing about) and Tracy Morgan voiced Miguel's disgustingly realistic dog slobber; I was always attached to Blu's tiny little heart strings. Maybe it was because i personally knew how that bird was feeling; being out of my comfort zone and feeling i was in too deep.A fairly run of the mill story unfold, not uncommonly found in ROM-COMS. I honestly expected Julia Roberts (in bird form) to come out at the end with her 'I'm just a girl, standing in front of a guy' monologue at the end. The climax of the film however was incredibly touching, as Blu finally 'believed he could fly' (thats an R Kelly nod) and swooped down to save an injured Jewel from impending death during the closing set piece.I normally recommend friends of my own age to view animated films, as i have become accustom to pulling deeper and more adult meanings from the subtext of these types of films, Rio however, i cannot. It's a kids movie through and through with a couple of tiny (failed) attempts at adult humor thrown in the middle, but i cant say i didn't have a good couple LOLZ in there too. Spectacular visuals, great casting and voice acting with a sound narrative. See this if you enjoyed MegaMind.TRACY MORGAN REPRESENT!7 out of 10",7,0,7,11 April 2011
Thor," Thor-oughly entertained by this one
","I have to admit, i had low expectations for this adaptation. Hulk yeah sure, Iron man, why not, Captain America, its set in the real word of course it'll work. But THOR? A wildly fantastical tale of Norse Gods and Rainbow bridges and nicknamed hammers ?? Surely not! Ill stop with the bashing; this film is astonishing. The oddest thing has happened here. Coupling notoriously artsy director Kenneth Branagh with one of Marvels most theatrical characters was a stroke of genius. At the beginning of the film, we are quickly introduced to Jane Foster, her whimsical offsider and an older gentleman. Storm chasers aren't normally this clever you might think to yourself during this opening scene, but alas, they are revealed to actually be physicists after a few minutes. An incredible storm arrives and THOR HAS LANDED: or so you would think. Mere moments after being introduced to our title character we are thrust on an astrological journey to Asgard, land of gods. Here we are introduced to Odin, the all father and his 2 young boys; Loki and Thor. Odin recites stories of an ancient war in which a planet load of frost giants planned to destroy the realm of Midgard (earth) before Odin and his merry men stepped in to save humanity. It is during this scene we are first shown Thor's arrogance and thirst for war. Skip ahead a few years and THOR has become Asgard's mightiest warrior, just as Odin had foretold. A celebration is occurring, Thor is about to be crowned as king of Asgard, but alas... this glorious day is interrupted by none other than said FrostGiants attempting to steal a stolen heirloom from Asgard's weapons locker.. The story rapidly gains traction from here. Thor marches into the Frost Giants planet (against his fathers will) in all his Aussie glory, kicking ass and taking names. He and his friends become swiftly over powered and Odin is left no choice but to step in. An argument erupts in which Odin tells Thor of his assholness and douchebaggery and that he is no longer worthy of his giant hammer Mjolnir or his god of Thunder status. Cast down to Earth the audience is reunited with the opening scene and we are officially filled in. A bevy of comedic scenes follow in which Chris hemsworth's THOR is tranquillised and run over multiple times. The film transitions backwards and forwards between our world and that of Asgard so as to keep us informed on going ons. Odin goes into a coma and Thor's mischievous bro Loki starts to come into his own. A marvellous story unfolds filled with action, humour, heartache and a whole heap of awesome!! Branagh's eye for curious shots is on full show here and works fabulously in creating a beautifully surreal Asgard. The films close is a little rushed but is also very heartfelt and strong. Leaving plenty of room for more character development, THOR is as good as if not better than every comic film to date, the characters were superbly cast and played and the story follows as close as it can to the source material as it can without being too over the top. Spectacularly fun movie, worthy of the Marvel name tag and certainly a sequel. 10 out of 10 for performance and entertainment....Make sure to stay after the credits for the Captain America nod.",8,33,60,27 April 2011
X-Men: First Class," X- trodinary!!!!
","Holy cow, what a movie. Nerd Alert! Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are superb. Each one by themselves would have made the movie terrific,when sharing the screen? Unbelievable! From to start to finish, incredible.Kevin Bacon has never done better,Jennifer Lawrence is awesome, Rose Byrne and January Jones don't have much importance, Ray Wise and Michael Ironside were dispensable, but all in all the cast was spectacular.The story is really well written. Kevin Bacon has a plan. Against him, the goodies work together. Their reasons different, but more or less all they want is him stopped. Charles and Erik are interesting characters. They argue. And we can argue forever about them, and about who is right.As you watch you desperately wish they could stay friends, but you know why they ultimately can't. Even if they themselves, in these early days, don't know it yet. To have that so perfectly captured in amovie is part of what makes this a treat and a future classic. Aside from their relationship to each other, the movie takes time to make each of them interesting in their own right. We see Charles as a teacher, and come to understand how he impacts upon the lives of those he teaches. Some of Erik's best moments are in his comments to Mystique about her appearance, making it clear that this man has more to him than his past. One scene where most of the supporting characters are clearly scared will certainly make you care about them for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately Sebastian Shaw's henchmen don't get anything to do except use their powers, and at the end of the story we know as much about January Jones as we did at the beginning.The FX are crazy good,using actual sets/costumes was a good idea. There are action scenes throughout the movie, the movie grows as it continues. The first part is more story so that when the action starts you care about the characters. Deaths, back-stabbings,awesome cameos and name dropping ensues. Awesome movie, really cool script and two incredible lead performances.I really hope they continue to build from this story. 9/10 One of the best movies in a long long time.",9,7,12,26 June 2011
The Social Network," wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
","Having not been too familiar with David Fincher's work (I KNOW, FIGHT CLUB WAS AMAZING I LATER FOUND OUT)I was skeptical at to how this film would turn out. After reading that the role of 'Mark Zuckerberg' had gone to Jesse Eisenberg (the geeky kid from Adventureland and Zombieland) i was even more of a skeptic, and the source material.... A movie about Facebook, honestly?BOY WAS I WRONG!! After reading a few reviews praising the film, i decided to head to the local cinema and spend the cash on the ticket. In retrospect it was my best investment of 2010 behind my 3D TV. The opening scene between Eisenberg and (soon to be Dragon tattoo star) Rooney Mara is by far one of the greatest achievements in recent scriptwriting history! Kudo's to Aaron Sorkin (West Wing script writer), it was awe inspiring and I'm sure will be studied in many an English class to come for decades. It really set up the character of 'MARK' out of the gates and was incredibly important in setting the tone for what was to come. The story roles quickly from there, introducing an impressive cast of characters, whom are throughout all given their own side stories and are very impressively presented with skill and believability. The standout of this film for me was Andrew Garfield, playing 'Zuckerberg's' betrayed best friend Eduardo Saverin. I was pleasantly surprised at his acting chops in both Drama and a few of the more comedic scenes (Quote: 'we have groupies')after 'The Facebook' starts to hit it big time. I now quietly wait in confidence for his turn as Peter Parker in Sony's SPIDERMAN reboot. Justin Timberlake fits his role well as the no holds barred entrepreneur and creator of Napster Sean Parker. Firstly presenting himself as a confident and established business-man before taking a very dramatic turn into some dark scenes involving drugs and under-age women(maybe drawing from experience?). Armie Hammer also deserved a giant nod for his role('s) as the Winkolvoss twins. A portrayal that will no doubt lead to him being cast in some rather large roles within the next few years for sure. Whoever cast Jesse Eisenberg over Michael Cera for the lead role needs a giant medal. Maybe even a shrine that we pray to for more brilliant casting decisions further in the future. He is nervous, sharp, witty, incredibly arrogant yet increasingly likable throughout.You believe him to be this bidding genius, whom has, in reality, changed the way we communicate forever.By far my pick for best actor @ the Oscars this year. I have never been one for Drama, but this has changed my entire outlook on movies as a whole and is easily in my TOP 5 OF ALL TIME! I have since seen it multiple times (much to the dismay of the money hungry distributors and their love of 3D at the moment) and it has been an absolute pleasure every time. Throughout you may have noticed my use of '' during the use of the names within the movie. The reason being that even though the movie is loosely based on actual events, the characters represented by the actors only share the namesake of their counterparts and therefore are not real world representations of said people. Ending on a high note. The sound track, the acting, the camera work, lighting, script,casting, everything in this movie is spot on. If this does not win best picture i will have lost all faith in the ACADEMY AWARDS. Best movie for the last 3 Years. Do yourself a favor, save $3 and see The Social Network over the 3D trash like TRON:LEGACY.",10,0,1,31 January 2011
