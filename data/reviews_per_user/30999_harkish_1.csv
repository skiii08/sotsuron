Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good for the 10 and under set
","My goodness, what a disappointment.  Between Jar Jar Binks, perhaps the most annoying character for adults in the last decade, and the young future Lord Vader, at 7 flying fighters into the belly of a Federation battleship, we are left with a truly sappy and simplistic flic.  Hopefully in the coming episodes Mr. Lucas will realize that part of his audience is out of grade school.",2,0,1,31 May 1999
