Scarface," Opinion
","Violent but a staple in movie history. A legend! Al Pacino portrays a character that seems somewhat exaggerated but is perfect in conveying how immigrants from Cuba would have to act in order to be/become successful. It is baffling to know that the movie was not such a big hit initially. Now, it has become eminent in movie history. Pacino is actually recognized more as Tony Montana rather than Al Pacino. His performance in this movie was unfortunately looked over at the time but finally he was recognized on how great of an actor he is. Pacino is not as debonair in this movie as he was in the godfather trilogy...guess it would be because of cultural differences.",8,1,3,18 June 2015
