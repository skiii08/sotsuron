Sucker Punch," Sucker Punched
","'You will be unprepared.' It was the tag line for this movie and I was unprepared like literally, it took my breathe away scenes after scenes. I really do have high hopes for this movie and it lived my expectations. Since it was announced I told myself that I have watch this movie. The first twenty minutes has no dialog. No one said a thing but you can clearly see what they were going through. Then it follows the sudden change of the movie setting. It started from the asylum then into a burlesque brothel. Then every time Baby Doll (Emily Browning) dances, she channels another world. A world where she and her friends; Sweet Pea (Abby Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), & Amber (Jamie Chung) kicks asses of Samurai-robot warriors, clock works, dragons, gores and robots from WWI to dragon lairs. And oh, the action sequence is AMAZING & the CGI effects was epic. This Zac Snyder film will blow your mind away with an incredible story line. So to make this long story short, GREAT MOVIE! I recommend you to watch this.",7,12,23,31 May 2011
Kung Fu Panda 2," It was indeed the return of awesomeness!
","'Return of the Awesomeness.' It was indeed the return of the awesomeness. First Kung Fu Panda was really damn good. They had good characters, good story and of course good humor. So, what do you expect in the sequel of the film? It really lived to it's tag line though it didn't lived my expectations because it went BEYOND. The story follows the dragon warrior - Po and the furious five; Tigress, Viper, Crane, Mantis and Monkey in their journey trying to save Kung Fu from the evil Lord Shen - who invented a new weapon that could end Kung Fu. The evil lord returned in making his plan into a reality with the help of this new weapon to end kung fu and conquer China after being banished by his father. Then later, Po realizes that the evil lord may or may have not done something in his missing childhood memories and he began to question himself 'Who is he?' I don't wanna spoil so better watch it. Kudos to the whole team behind this movie. I loved how they put a very good sense of humor. Plus, the comedic timing of everyone was great! And you can see that the characters really matured especially Po. Casting of the voices in the new characters were great too. And the I liked the fact that in some scenes you can't feel it 3D - unless you want it 3D the whole time and regretting it later for the soring of your eyes. They really did a good job on the effects, animations and colors were freaking great! it's 10 over 10 movie for me :)",10,1,4,31 May 2011
