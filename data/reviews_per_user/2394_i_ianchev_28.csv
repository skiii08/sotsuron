Blade Runner 2049," Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner
","'Blade Runner 2049' is out and it might be even better than the old one...OK, so first of all I'd like to say that I very much like the 1982 first 'Blade Runner' by Ridley Scott. But I don't think it's flawless. Actually it was a very good attempt at mixing film noir and sci-fi, maybe the best example to date. But it had actual blank spots in some characters and plot wise it was nearly, but not completely perfect.Having said this, I am really happy that a script like Blade Runner's got a sequel and I must say - a rather good sequel. In fact I am very happy that again Denis Villeneuve has proved himself an able director and a true visionary with an own voice and soul, beautifully presented on the silver screen.To be able to give you an idea of what a movie you should expect to see, when you go to 'Blade Runner 2049', I will tell you that maybe you must not think of the original as the thought provoking film many people think it is. At least not in the way I see it. To me this title is really a mixture of a perfect example of genre movie. A detective story, a sci-fi story, a humanistic story, an internal cosmos story.Blade Runner was never about logical and consequential plot and it never feeds its themes to the viewers directly. But it is subtle. Subtle in its character development, it its relationships intricate details, in the way the story asks questions, but does not provide always answers. Story wise this new movie is minimalistic, and though it has its small problems in some side scenes and decisions seen in them, the film is a lesson in presentation and evolution of characters. I am personally touched by the way Villeneuve shows us the relationship between Joe and Joi. It is realistically unnatural how we humans can accept AI and its manifestations. And the human brain works on so many levels that it seems even we cannot absorb what is possible and not, what is real and what is not. These thin visual and mental lines are for me one of the life threads of this film. Actors playing (mainly Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford) do a stunningly good job. Almost all supporting actors and actresses fill this unreal world with life and rhythm. So overall I can say - the teams behind the script and the technological representation of ideas on the screen have done a magnificent job.What it means to be human. What makes us happy. What puts meaning into our hearts and minds. All these questions are asked anew. The difference is this time, I feel much more connected to 'K', than I did before to Deckard. The lead character has a very hard path, but it is filled with wondrous happenings, which I believe come from very personal experiences behind the script. The connection between 'K' and Joi, between Deckard and 'K' are thought provoking and really a master class in cinema. I dare not say more about them, as I have to learn how these beautiful constructions work, so that I can dissect them and implement them in real life better. It is amazingly beautiful to witness such depictions of humanity in characters whose sole existence is so robotic and meaningless. I am truly astonished of the actors' play, of the emotions behind the gestures and words. Genius!So, I better get to the other astonishing part of this movie - the futuristic look and sound of this film. Again the creators Roger Deakins (cinematography), Hans Zimmer, Benjamin Wallfisch (music), David Doran, Bence Erdelyi, Lydia Fry (art direction) have done a perfect job. Also costumes, set decoration and makeup are on a very high level. One can feel the future when witnessing this movie. It is so real and ambient.So I really appreciate this gift from Villeneuve and recommend it to anyone with a taste for cyberpunk, thrills and sci-fi. But most of all, I wish that we all could learn more about how important it is to do our work with passion and everlasting hunger for individual creation and love for freedom in expression. A tour de force!",10,3,10,7 October 2017
Black Swan," Extreme artistry
","I'm continuing my journey through my favorite movies of all time with the graceful extremism of 'Black Swan'...This melodramatic film piece by Darren Aronofsky was such a big inspiration for me back in 2010, that I felt that I need to present it with a special place here. The role which brought an Oscar to Natalie Portman (well deserved) is passionate and creepy at the same time. The story is loosely based on Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet, but the main focus is on the extremism of the artistic dedication. Only the best examples of artistic expressionism reach to such a point that they loose themselves into the abyss of the eternal applause. And the character of Nina Sayers really does that at the end. Her emotional breakdown transforms into a state of perfection which transcends over ballet into eternal veracity. Her repressed personality and extreme dedication hurl her into the frightening world of temptation and danger. The jealous mother, the unsatisfied director, the tempting competitor - they all play their role in the creation of the wonderful symbiosis of the White and Black swan in Nina. We witness the growth of a confused gentle swan which is aimed at perfection. Nina truly achieves perfection at the end of the movie, but at the cost losing her sanity and life. Giving everything to the performance, she embraces happily the applause of the world which has made her suffer so greatly before. As a true artist, she crosses the line between reality and fiction with a gentle, but firm 'pas de deux'.The cinematography, the choreography are truly astonishing contributions to this art piece. And the music - marvelous. Lurking and intoxicating, graceful and majestic - the soundtrack is an essential part of the story. It is namely the mesmerizing psychological entirety of 'Black Swan' which makes us gasp at the end of the movie. This embodiment of the artistic life and performance is and will be given as an example of perfect cinematography. A glorious garland which shines through life, death and ultimately over eternity.",10,4,6,18 February 2014
It," IT is simply the truth
","The new 'IT' screening gets pretty much everything right...From the shocking rip off of child's arm to the true realization of what it means to grow up, the 2017 movie is true to the King's novel and closer to the viewers' hearts.Â I'm not a big fan of horror movies and of King's books, but went to see this film knowing that it will most probably scare me. And it did spectacularly.Â First I will mention the only two problems which I have with this movie and why I rate it 8/10.Â  - too many jump scares. Too often frightening scenes follow one after another and this takes out a bit of the positive impression which those moments should create; - horror movies are rarely perfect examples of cinematography. Of course there are some non-believable moments in the movie where some characters take some 'stupid' decisions which are not logical. Also the bullying in the film goes way ahead of itself. But sometimes in reality children tormenting other children indeed is brutal. Now to the more interesting themes of the movie and its execution. First I'd like to mention that this film is shot beautifully creepy. I can't think of any technical error or edgy 3D episode in it. Also, the music score is subtle and supporting, at times it takes the lead, but without leading the viewer too much above the actual feeling being presented on the screen. The cast is great - from Bill Skarsgard to Sophia Lillis - all actors are great. The supporting characters, representing the children's respective parents are also true embodiments of the certain problematic topics which usually ruin the psychology of a child. The screenplay by Chase Palmer and Cary Fukunaga (True Detective anyone?) is respectfully following the book with only some scenes from the book missing (sewer scene between the teens!). So overall everything which compiles a good film is obviously here. And most importantly - the film directly transmits to the viewers the deep message of fear overpowering, proper upbringing importance and teenage character development.Â  We see the exact moments when most of the main characters challenge their deep fears and fight them off. And step by step, as in real life, Bill, Ben, Beverly and the others become their own role models. Such growth is very harsh to the character of a minor, but it impacts influences his/her life more deeply and complete. Because once a person repeats the act and defiance against a deepest fear, the result is no longer what is desired, but also transforms into ambition, integrity and pure devotion. All virtues of a truly realized man or a woman. And perhaps this is why Stephen King's books are so popular - you can't fake life, you can only represent it the best way you can. After all - human's imagination is only a result of the perception of reality.",8,5,11,10 September 2017
A Star Is Born," A star is born in love
","You can't hide anything from love. And you can nurture talent with love.Bradley Cooper's directorial debut just hit theaters and I couldn't resist to see it ASAP.It really stands up to its name and already amassed glowing reviews. It's a very emotional tale of a singer in his twilight years finding and helping the love of his life become a star singer, but also his better side.
I was struck about how this motion picture dug deep into viewers hearts and how iconic the characters were made to look and sound like. And I think that phrase from Cooper 'When you have a question, you gotta ask it.' is really emoting from this movie. This script is already shot 3 times during 3 different eras of American cinema and I gotta say, this one is without doubt the truest.
Lady Gaga is over performing herself, expressing all her character on the screen. Bradley Cooper has created and brought to screen a very 'burnt' depiction of a man in fame. And it struck my heart in so many chords that I have to say this is one of the best movies of the year.
It has a very original soundtrack, which involves you even deeper. Wonderfully shot characters which evolve and yet stay true to their nature. A film about music, life, relationships, but above all - love.
I had two very eclectic moments in the movie. The first one was when Bradley Cooper's Jack apologizes to Bobby for his insult. The reaction from Sam Elliott's character was so empowering and so proudly emotional that I will remember it for a long time. A person can really relate to such a conversation and intuitional moment.
The second, of course, is the last scene song transition from the concert to the piano. A very general and yet intimate moment of affection and compassion. The production quality is indeed present and I believe that we're seeing a very good director coming forward.
At the end of this review, I'd like to say that it's for movies like this that we have a passion for cinema and music. These two interconnect very intensely and the past decade has proven that we can do much better in life, in relationships and in knowing ourselves, if we just allow these art forms of expression flow through us and let us just be out there in the space between us.",9,2,5,7 October 2018
Gravity," Breathing guide
","Do we really breathe properly? That's what I was thinking after I saw the movie. I don't know, maybe I was a little bit emotional after I saw the film of Alfonso Cuarón. But I think I will not make a mistake if I state that living is a lot like breathing - you have ups and downs and sometimes you enjoy it, other times you can barely get through it. With such a soulful movie in front of us we cannot stay indifferent. From the first glimpse of our beautiful planet to the last shot of the sea shore - we are engulfed in a spacious journey which endeavors in the bright and dark places of our inner and outer human universe. In a broader aspect - this is a story about our place in life and space and how we perceive it. I'm not really sure if I have seen a better performance by Sandra Bullock, but I'm pretty much convinced that it will not be the last of her magnificent reincarnations. And George Clooney not only looked as the calmest person in the cosmos - he convinced me that to be a parental figure, you have to work hard and always act natural. This is the best way to represent what is truly happening in your mind and heart. Every breath of the main character, Dr. Ryan Stone, is co-experienced by the viewer. No matter how calm or fearful, her breathing is heartfelt, because we all know what is fear and tranquility and how these two can change their places suddenly. That is why I enjoyed every minute of this spectacle. It was entertaining, enlightening and rewarding. A guide into finding the will to overcome yourself and live life as it is.",9,2,5,11 October 2013
Akira," Dystopian Rage
","'Akira' is a milestone in the worldwide human culture which is still going to affect generations to comeEvery single day some of us live through a rough day full of nerve wrecking experiences and unaccomplished dreams. Each one of us faced the problems which spawn from our modern way of life – a society bubbling with many various people full of egoistic purposes and goals. Each person has desires and runs head on 'till the wall of limitations stands in his/her way. We don't want to be mistook or underestimated, or wrong. We all want to succeed in what we do and achieve what we dream of. But in most of the cases people just in walls of prejudice and egoistic competition.We all strive for that freedom and success, fulfillment and happiness which go with accomplishing whatever you desire. That's what moved Tetsuo – unhappiness from childhood abuse and loneliness, dreams of being that arrogant bastard who is the leader of the pack. Kaneda is more pure hearted – he IS indeed the leader, he had the same troubled childhood, but he always chose to fight, to excel in whatever he does – fighting schoolmates, kicking rival motor gang leaders in the teeth, picking up dangerous chicks, or fighting monsters to save the world. He is just always ahead of his mates, his friends, his rivals. He of that sort of people who is always surviving to be better than the others. Not because he is actually something more than them, but because he decided that fear is not the answer to all the troubles which the dark world around him presents to him. Something which Tetsuo cannot understand. And that's why Akira has to take Tetsuo to another place, where there are no rules, there is no life yet, and the little prick can create whole new galaxies, full of darkness and light, primal worlds where he is not being defined and defied – possibilities which doesn't come with limitations. This is why Kaneda is suited better for this dystopian world – he can channel his rage and angst into excelling as a motorcycle rider, fighter and survivor.In our own modern world we strive to be better, but most of us are forced to compromise and suffer because of feeling fear and losing confidence and and resilience. It's essential to provoke every single day that same spark which we feel when watching Kaneda ride his bike. But most of the times we can't do that – every morning is a new opportunity to believe in the possibility of fulfilling our dreams. And right after that the day shows us that we simply cannot achieve everything as we want it. And then comes the fear. And the laziness which causes loss after loss. Because we simply cannot maintain that same level of excitement and energy which we had at one moment.This is why we need remember that we are just a glimpse in history, a blink of an eye in the life of a galaxy – and we cannot live with fear and compromise all the time. It is important to overcome most of the problems so that we can succeed in being whatever we want to be and become. Just to live how we want to live it and not regret it. That's how the colonel and Kaneda live. And that's why they survive after all the destruction. Maybe the human DNA is indeed changing and at one time we might be able to achieve whatever we want without the need to devise this internal energy somehow.Let's just enjoy the ride as we want it, and don't have any remorse about being good or bad.",10,5,10,25 May 2014
Interstellar," Interstellar feels sorry
","This movie is so eloquently presenting us with our current problems that we have to be blind to miss the chance to change our main goals as species...It seems that one has to eat a lot of corn to be able to produce such a concept as Interstellar. Or am I wrong? :) This sci-fi movie is dedicated to our eternal struggle to reach and research, to conquer and obtain. It strives to reach for Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey', but somewhere near the end of its run it lands below it. At the end of its 169-minute runtime one feels relieved that he has endured this emotional and transcending journey into space-time, gravity and physics. So much information and ideas float throughout this movie that we feel incomprehensibly lacking intelligence at some moments. That is because Mr. Nolan is giving us too much information in too short time. That being said - the film is incredible and beautiful. And even more - practically a direct message to our hearts that it is up to us to decide what to do - concentrate on saving our planet and our species or on what we do best - survive no matter what. The constellation of actors is incredible - McConaughey, Hathaway, Caine, Damon, Chastain, Affleck - we see almost the best cast which one director can assemble these years. And they play very well. The viewer can feel and succumb into their emotions - fear, despair, happiness, hope and so on. The camera perfectly follows the circular journey of our main character (conqueror) Coop'. The special effects and the music are GIGANTIC. Hans Zimmer is truly offering us the feel of depth and infinity.The drought and famine which are the problem of the future's Earth are our problem right now too. Climatic changes are bringing us to the same problems which are presented in the movie as a certain reason of our species demise. That is why this film is so necessary at this point of our development as a modern society. That is why I liked very much the way Mr. Nolan has expressed his views in this movie.Also, please keep in mind that there are some VERY emotional and controversial scenes of confrontation between McConaughey and Hathaway, between McConaughey and Damon. There are some peaks of emotional strain which can offer you not only very good acting lessons, but also a perfect dissection of our human nature. This is what I liked best in this movie. And also - of course the topics about family relationships and love. It is very important that we always remember and understand that we as humans need to share with each other, to help and to remember each other. The the only gravity which transcends beyond time and connects us eternally is LOVE.",9,0,3,9 November 2014
Man of Steel," Superman
","We all love superman. It is not only an epic. It is a mark of generations of newborn people in all over the world. The Man of Steel is our symbol not only of hope and humanity, but also our inner voice which tells us that we CAN do anything when we really want it. It is not a coincidence that this is my first review on this website after so many years of watching, reading and rating movies. It is a purposeful act of self establishment. And as a fan of Superman I shall judge 'Man of Steel' with my heart. Not as a critic, measuring the views and income of this movie. Not as an film adorer, putting the film characteristics above the content of the particular movie. Yes, I am a true follower of Superman since his origin so many years ago, when the superpowers and the heroism were common more to gods or real people, than to imaginary characters. Our society has come to an age in which our ideals are embodied in new personalities - the superheroes. We are proud to prove and we do not fear to admit that we love superheroes. No matter how alien or imaginary they are. And on this pantheon of great new legends there is the 'Grand Daddy' of them all - Superman. The alien who lost all which he had even before he realized it. The man of steel who is like a god compared to the humans, but is at the same time afraid of showing himself to the public. This man has been brought to life again by Zach Snyder this year. It has been long time since the first footage of this movie was presented to us. And now I've finally seen it. But is it the real, shining, bright example which we needed to see not only as a moviegoers, but as a contemporary society? I'm trying to find the right words to approach what I saw without being too long. But I fail. Mr. Snyder, Mr. Goyer, why was General Zod your best character in this production? Why has this good original material which you had been turned into scattered and predictable character design and plot? I'm not mad at what you did, but at how you did it. With all the creative power which you have (Mr. Snyder I even liked your 'Sucker punch', it was whole and finished), this is at least on 60% of what you could have brought to our senses. You had every fan of Superman at the beginning of the movie. With the wonderful soundtrack of this movie you had all the power to capture us forever. And you had a good cast too. Why did the Man of Steel look so shallow? Why didn't I feel his internal pain from the beginning? Why was I distracted by the elaborate Kpypton world when after that you cut the umbilical cord with such a huge time gap. And the growth of Kal-El was presented in a shortcut way which left us emotionally distanced from Superman. Clark's endeavors were not a journey, but rather a given result. His discoveries of his origin were 'ready', not processed, doubted, discussed. And why did you make Louis Lane's character so superficial and following? Did you forget your work on 'Watchmen', on '300''s characters? Where was the Script writer when the Kent family evolved together as a family? We get to see only 4-5 steps of growing as an alien on Earth and receiving the warmth and moral of a hardworking family. I think that if we got to see more of Jonathan and Martha as human beings we will be much more addicted to Clark's internal moral codes. Which is ultimately our own human moral values bible. I loved the thought that Clark is Superman ONLY on earth and due to our planet's conditions. And that he is Superman only because of the instilled consciousness by Jonathan and Martha. I respect your back story about his genes from Jor-El. And about the sad story of Krypton. I enjoyed Jor-El's extended presence in the film. But was he the main motivator of Clark's actions? How is it possible that General Zod and his subordinates evoke my sympathy more than Clark and the earthlings? In the third and final fight when Zod lost everything Michael Shannon acts perfectly. Even the non-fans at the theater were touched by this monster alien. And I felt really unsatisfied, because Clark was superficial and his actions were expected. And in the end he was embraced by Louis as a child. Is Superman always the hopeful child to you? I truly respect your new point of view, Mr. Snyder. You and your team did put a lot of work in this project. But please when you do the sequel remember that Superman is like no other epic hero. He is the HEART of our pantheon of heroes. He is the center of all branches and roots. He is not the peak, he is the base. Let him grow slower and more in contradictory details. Don't just rush him into adventure and action. And if you let him live more in between other humans, we will feel at ease more around this alien. Yes, I know that this movie is good and well-thought. You will say that. And it is true, I liked it overall. But this comes more from the fact that Superman is our hero, our legend, our shining star after which we will live our lives in attempts to do the right thing for ourselves, for our families, for our society and for the future of all things in the never ending flow of time.",7,0,2,25 June 2013
The Revenant," DiCaprio - the Revenant
","I must say that DiCaprio is continuously over the topTo explain the least – Mr. Glass, DiCaprio's character, is a strong source material. But to be able to deliver such a performance, you have to not only dedicate all your strength and stamina, but also have a huge talent – something which Leonardo has in abundance. Combining this with Inarritu's perfect directing skills and Lubezki's paranormal filming abilities – this one had to be the best of the year.And indeed it is – the struggle between man and nature, the vengeance trip, the human relationships, the environmental message – we all see that in its entire run. I must admit that the rawness of the shots were a bit too much at some times for me, but this indeed made the movie true to the real life of these people at that time and at that place.The music is by Ryuichi Sakamoto and I strongly recommend it to every open soul which desires to hear something new and vibrant. The costumes are profoundly adequate and the narrative is rich with pristine survival instincts.But the main character in this film is the nature itself. No matter if we speak about the snow, the trees, the bear or the wind itself – this is what really shakes the viewer in his seat. I purposely didn't pay much attention to the dialogue, but rather enjoyed the 'conversations' between Glass and his environment. His journey is delicately decorated with flashbacks and dreamlike visions which explain not only the personal story of the character, but also his urge to finish this journey and do what he has to do.The movie is long enough for you to be able to immerse in the setting, so take your time and don't rush to deduct or explain it. There will be plenty of reasons to do that in the next years which I am sure will prove it to be a classic.",10,15,32,23 December 2015
No Country for Old Men," This is No country for old men
","I have recently watched Cormac McCarthy's 'The Counselor' and that's why I decided to pay due attention to his'and the Coen brothers' 'No country for old men'. A true hunter-prey classic tale about life...I'll start from the ending, where sheriff Bell shares his two dreams - the first about losing the money that his father (also a sheriff) gave him and the second about his ride along with his father. I can truly connect to this metaphor. It is a vivid vehicle for the directors and the script - our fears, hopes and thoughts are all reflected in our dreams. And the dream to follow into his father's steps became kind of a nightmare (losing the money his father gave him) for Bell. But the true message which we receive through this insightful movie is the moral of the second dream. You see, the title of this film comes from the 20th century dramatist William Butler Yeats's poem 'Sailing to Byzantium'. It goes like this:'That is no country for old men. The young In one another's arms, birds in the trees – Those dying generations – at their song, The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas, Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long Whatever is begotten, born, and dies. Caught in that sensual music all neglect Monuments of unageing intellect''Those dying generations' are Bell, his father, his uncle and his grandfather who were all sheriffs at the depicted parts of West Texas. And their covenant is fading and will ultimately be lost. The weary and old sheriff is overwhelmed by his own incapacity to deal with the new generation of crime and loathing. His uncle Ellis reminds him that these parts have always been wild and violent. Despite this Bell feels like his grasp is not firm enough and that he is heading where his father 'awaits'. After all his efforts to help Llewelyn Moss despite his fear, he ends up finding him dead. And he feels like there is nothing he can do about it. That people like Anton Chigurh and the Mexican drug cartel members overmatch him with their boundless discontentment. That law and order are already lost and he can do nothing but stay away from this world of the hunters and their prey. I think that this is exactly why at the end of this movie he has accepted his part as the one who will inevitably fade away like a dinosaur, like an 'old man'. Failure is weighing above his consciousness. And that's why after his retirement he is more content, troubled only by his dreams, reflecting on his past where he sees no future for individuals like himself. This is a very interesting juxtaposition - between the feeling of moral codes passing and the sense that since ancient times people have always been the same, that we are living in a circle of discontentment. This is both eerie and assuring to me. What do you think?And in the end I just want to add my utter admiration of Cormac McCarthy's books which show us our violent nature of selfishly deluded living beings. The stories are mature and absorbing. Reassuring that there is no white and black, only gray in our lives. The script is precise in tension, with thrilling sound and camera work. The imagery is both beautiful and a bit hopeless. I felt some of these aspects in 'The Counselor' too, but then again Ridley Scott and The Coen brothers are two very different categories.",9,1,3,23 February 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Why, Mr. Jackson?
","Mr. Peter Jackson﻿ , why would you do this to the second movie? It is such a filler that I was almost sure that I'm watching something which is not from the Tolkien universe. As a lifelong fan of these books I have been awaiting every adaptation with huge anticipation. And with The lord of the rings you did such a perfect artwork, that the whole world was (and still is) at your feet. It is a true reconstruction of the whole tale. And even with the first Hobbit film you did a good, inspiring fantasy epic. But everything that you did right with the trilogy and the first Hobbit movie, you did wrong with the second one. I cannot imagine how I would've felt if there wasn't the scene between Smaug and Bilbo. The whole movie would have been pointless if it was bas as well. At least that scene was deserving. Of course that doesn't change the fact that you made up 2/3 of the story and characters from The Desolation of Smaug. Scenes, characters, relations - all out of space and sense. And why? Because the big bosses from the studios implied that they want more movies and money. Because cinema is a tool which can be perverted. But you can't do that to Sir Tolkien's imagination! His works are beyond time, beyond people or wealth. So that is why I would like to ask of you, Mr. Peter Jackson - please do the third one right (you have the materials). If not to us, the fans, you owe it to Tolkien's legacy.",6,16,29,17 December 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Grand Budapest Hotel
","I have actually the feeling that movies like this expand my synapses rapidly...This film deserves to be acclaimed not only because it represents the best features of our civilization, but also because it is masterfully executed. This peculiar story about the concierge Gustave and his loyal lobby boy Zero is a beautiful and intriguing comedic thriller tale. But it is deceptive. The main character is 'The Author'. But who is the author?The emotionally ornamented journey of the viewer is carefully prepared. We witness how Gustave and Zero overcome many obstacles during their adventure between the two European wars. But the main focal point is on the elegance of the human behavior. Education and good manners are just the package, the insights of this movie dessert are the care and love which we feel through this nostalgic piece of cinematography. In our modern times of speed and greed we forget way too often that we can change each other's energy the right way. This movie is a cheerful escapism to a more romantic world which we lost a century ago. And what about the cast, what about the acting? Ralph Fiennes is such a driving force. He delivers both funny and dramatic performance, complemented by a constellation of good actors and actresses such as Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Goldblum and the young Tony Revolori. The music is unconventionally good and I very much liked the sets and costumes. But let's get back to the author. The movie ends with a dedication to Stefan Zweig. This is the logical conclusion to the Wes Anderson's (the director) message to the public. And to translate that into words I will paraphrase Zweig himself: - Every man with a moral sense will always consider his own existence empty and insignificant without the comforting thought and empowering illusion that he, as a separate entity, may contribute something to the overall improvement of the moral world. The man becomes an author through his aspirations and activities. The creator's imagination which can change the world for the better.",9,4,12,21 March 2014
Sing Street," Drive it along Sing street
","I thought that 2016 was dominated musically by 'La La Land', but then I saw 'Sing street'...Well, what can I say - music is everything sometimes. And just sometimes - movie making through music is what it takes to make everyone feel so much better. Topics like family, growing up, friendship and love fill this movie with the necessary energy to carry you from beginning to end with joy and passion. I am truly inspired how the main characters start from the desire to be noticed and reach some of the highest peaks of originality in art. The 80's background music, set and costumes are far too attractive to be missed. And for me - these are all hallmarks of great directorship and cinematography. The desire to associate with, to give, to win, translates to the viewer the impression of youth's vigor and love towards pushing down walls and changing habits. The young cast of this film reminds us to never let the important things run out of our lives, no matter how hard the situation is. And always to share every spark of creativity. The unique cultural-historical perspective of this movie shows again how music connects past and future, now and then.Across cultures and distances we are interconnected by art, and in particular by good music. We can experience the passion to express ourselves all the way along our path of growing up and chasing our dreams. And to see once again how we must never lose grasp of our goals, no matter how hard it gets along the way.This movie is an excellent example of how the family can influence any young kid in both a good and a bad way. Also - the importance of a good advice against the malice of poverty and ignorance is really obvious. 'Sing Street'is the newest story of how love can actually save and dignify. But more than everything we see - how music can be a solution to all. And without any guaranteed success at the end, we enjoy this film as a really splendid creation of nostalgia, music and love.I truly recommend this small treasure to you and your close ones. We can never have too much music and love in our lives!",9,6,8,6 February 2017
Silence," Always beside you, never silent
","It took me some time to comment on my most anticipated film of the year - 'Silence', by Martin Scorsese, but it was worth it...The central notion of spirituality and human nature is the very essence of faith in this masterpiece by Mr. Scorsese.We see two Jesuit priests (Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield) going on a journey in peril. The aim - to find their mentor - Father Ferreira, who has renounced his faith after being tortured in Japan.St. Paul's college in Macau is indeed a symbolical building to marvel at. It emphasizes on the transience of an era of devout, dogmatic Christianity. But still, its facade exhibits the magnificence of the human spirit. And how faith can travel and conquer, but also stay and change, transform any place in the world.There is a really nice poem called 'Footprints in the sand'. It speaks volumes of the Christian faith, and to that matter - volumes of any faith, which is righteous. It goes like this:'One night I dreamed a dream. As I was walking along the beach with my Lord. Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life. For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand, One belonging to me and one to my Lord.After the last scene of my life flashed before me, I looked back at the footprints in the sand. I noticed that at many times along the path of my life, especially at the very lowest and saddest times, there was only one set of footprints.This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it. 'Lord, you said once I decided to follow you, You'd walk with me all the way. But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life, there was only one set of footprints. I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me.'He whispered, 'My precious child, I love you and will never leave you Never, ever, during your trials and testings. When you saw only one set of footprints, It was then that I carried you.'This is very much what to my account this movie is about. The hidden treasures of faith lie within our own understanding of life and its meaning. In 'Silence' not all questions of father Rodrigues are answered, as nor do all of our delusions meet their end throughout our lives. But we all witness the pain and torture which the great ensemble of characters endure. Here, I must really praise the directorial work and all the actors' incredible performances. We must emphasize that all characters - from the main one to the smallest and most episodic ones - are represented truly and faithfully.We see Japan and the Japanese way of life as it is. Nothing is spared, nothing is hidden. Nature itself is a major character in this movie. It is no coincidence that 'Silence' was nominated only for Cinematography for the annual Academy awards - perhaps this is the most incredible part of the film. I cannot explain enough how the visuals speak volumes of storytelling to the viewer. We are engulfed in the sounds and colors of this magical godly realm called Earth. You must truly experience this both beautiful and disturbing nature of the movie.The screenplay twists and turns around us and our expectations. We feel our own doubts and remorse, we live the same life deeply within is and at the end of the journey we feel maybe a bit better about out choices in life. Not because the film gives a final solution, or because it pretends to be a parable. This monumental work from Mr. Scorsese about how the human spirituality works is a fine example of storytelling through introduction of a riveting internal dialogue within each and every viewer.I myself feel the need to share this film with everybody that cares for cinema, spirituality and purpose in life. It is a shining example of a perfect movie experience and a carefully paved way to self discovery.",10,11,20,30 January 2017
The Artist," The Artistry
","Or why 'The Artist' is one of my most favorite movies of all time and the best film in 2011...This movie is a wonderful reason to prove my point of view that everything in life must be done as an artistic expression. 'The Artist' is a magnificent piece of cinematic experience, not only because it brings us back to basics (what is a film, how should actors play, how can the sound, the point of view of the camera and the black and white colors express all the detailed aspects of different emotions), but also because it makes us better humans. During the 100 minutes of 'The Artist' we enjoy not only a warm and lovable film, but we are reminded a very important lesson - that cinema was created to convey natural human feelings and bring people from different places and cultures together. The lack of dialogue and colors don't make this movie more introverted. They serve a very special purpose - to bring forth every gesture, every mimic, every touch and facial expression, which we miss even in our every day life. This is another reason why 'The Artist' is such a treasure. I must say - the aristocratic crisis of the main character is such a powerful symbol! Every single person has some kind of a talent. And when we develop it, our ego grows with it. But we really recognize our own features only when we meet another gifted person. And this is how the two main characters collide and show us the true virtue of life - love. From this moment on George Valentin and Peppy Miller are entangled into one fate and future. They save each other from the true grayness of life.So when we see them dance at the end of the film, we are truly and heartily happy for them. And the creme de la creme is the breathless finale of this masterpiece of film making.",9,1,5,30 January 2014
La La Land," The fools who dream of La La Land
","And here's to the fools who dream Crazy, as they may seem Here's to the hearts that break Here's to the mess we make...I really, really love to discuss such heartwarming movies, which deliver the full specter of positive to melancholic emotions, but no negativity at all. 'La La Land' from Damien Chazelle is indeed an awaited masterpiece after his break performance with Whiplash. So much energy and genuine talent is represented in his scripts, directing and music, that I am truly inspired after watching his every film. His producers are really joyful after working with him, describing him as a very young visionary, who really lives with his work, and tell that after he is done with a movie, he lingers on it long after the shooting is done. Maybe because for any true auteur every piece of art is like a new baby born by his imagination and hard work. So this time he chose a more familiar cast - Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone (the latter can Really sing!). I think that they both got talent and am really a fan of Gosling's film project choices. He truly does not have a failure (yes, I am looking at you newcoming Blade Runner movie!). So having also the chemistry between them two, the director can only pinpoint the amazing, yet pretty often used storyline. I prefer not to speak so much about script, rather than music and performances. The feel which we get from this movie is rather energetic, fresh and warm. Life is really nothing but a sequence of events which we truly must welcome and embrace, not matter the costs of mistakes and misses. The passion of the main characters for what they love and do is indeed great, but it pales in front of these rare moments of togetherness in creativity which they have. And that's why the third act is the strongest one. When they break out, they estrange from each other, but not to the point of losing that connection which they have from the beginning. And although people are born alone and constantly move on and change, these two characters really resemble our ever lingering spirit of dreaming and high hopes. Even if the reality crumbles, even if Sebastian and Mia choose separating paths, they are bound to be together in their dreams. And when those dreams come true, they are happy despite the physical distance between them. There is much wisdom in this film. And the beautiful shots are really complimentary to the exact directing of the motion. Los Angeles is a really nice scene for the story and the color palette of the movie is truly positive. I want to point out the song which Mia sings at the last casting - 'Audition'. It truly made me smile, because it represents a spirit, which I don't really show, but which I love. And reminded to me of a very special person of mine. Also, I want to express my deepest respect of the conclusion song and montage. I really turned this 9/10 movie into 10/10 for me. Love and Creativity are truly strong forces in our lives. They show our spirit and souls like nothing else. And even our mind and perception are puzzled by the disappearing boundaries which are torn down by everlasting art.",10,11,19,8 January 2017
12 Years a Slave," Human Dignity
","Here's why my favorite movie of 2013 is '12 years a slave'...A film about human dignity and the will to survive. Overcoming the emotions which flow through me when I talk about this movie, I am certain that I must write about it. It is a cinematographic masterpiece that deserves your attention. Based on the true story of Solomon Northup and his memoir book 'Twelve Years a Slave: Narrative of Solomon Northup, citizen of New-York, kidnapped in Washington city in 1841, and rescued in 1853, from a cotton plantation near the Red River in Louisiana' this artwork is a revelation. A revelation about how we humans can treat each other and to what extend we can suffer. It is hard to talk about slavery, because it is not a widespread 'disease' in today's society. But every human being which feels and thinks will be touched by this story. There are many morals coming out of Steve McQueen's work, but I guess the most important one is about how a person cannot easily forget injustice. And that's exactly why the vile actions depicted in the story are so monstrous. But against them we are seeing the flickering hope and human dignity which illuminate the path to salvation. I was in awe especially from the small, but significant moments of truth when Solomon stayed by himself and tried to keep his memories - who he is, that he has his loving family and ultimately about his nature as a FREE person.As spectators we are moved by the wonderful play of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o, Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch. I only wish that by watching this true story of the survival of human dignity we embrace each other as nations and as people even more. We are all children of our planet and we all have the equal right to call ourselves FREE men and women.It is essential to quote Brad Pitt's character Bass at the end of this review: 'Laws change. Social systems crumble. Universal truths are constant. It is a fact, it is a plain fact that what is true and right is true and right for all.'",10,2,6,1 February 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," At the edge of a concept
","I personally think that 'Edge of tomorrow'is a very smart, funny and entertaining movie. But that's not its main value - the script is the best thing about it...There are already many movies about time loops. And some of them are brilliant (remember 'Groundhog day'?). So Edge of tomorrow had to be good to break through its predecessors. And it does in a very fresh and innovative way. The story is originally Japanese (of course!) - from Hiroshi Sakurazaka's 'All You Need Is Kill'. So they had a good start even before shooting this picture. But the transition from book to finished script is also very good. The new imported details are pretty decent, considering what has been presented to us in the recent years by the film industry. It took some 2-3 years to finish this movie and boy did Tom Cruise do a good job! It is incredible how Emily Blunt is incorporated in this movie as the second main hero. Both main characters are developed very well and I would like to add that they have incredible chemistry on screen. This should also mean that the director of this movie (Doug Liman) has done this time a what he should have done with 'Jumper' before, for example.Anyway, I should move on. I think that the graphics and the creatures' design are indeed cool and interesting for us viewers. Recently the aliens concepts in movies were rather dumb I should say. So a straight A goes to the designers behind this project. Besides - the camera is swinging perfectly between scenes and the colors and lighting are matching perfectly the mood you as a viewer have to feel. So from technical point of view - the film is incredibly entertaining. About the whole structure of this sci-fi action movie - I think that many people will see it only as a very good entertainment piece. But the reason why so many viewers will like this movie has roots in the relationship between the main two characters and the interesting concepts of time repeat, life-death situations, the meaning of war, and of course the greatest concept of them all - inevitability. This word for me represents the reason why so many people relate to this film. That is because we all feel the same way as Tom Cruise's character in this movie at many moments in our lives. We all have this feeling of not being able to escape from certain situations or certain course of events. For good or bad, we as humans tend to believe that we have only one chance, only one life, only one true choice. But the truth is that we don't need to stiffen that much about this. If we do what we feel is right, the outcome will always be OUR outcome, no matter if it is what is expected or not. So much like the feeling of fulfillment this film piece is giving us the sense of completion at the end of the movie. This is the same with every good movie.",9,1,3,2 August 2014
Whiplash," A Whiplash
","The best chemistry between two leading actors within years...I have been waiting to see this movie for such a long time and for that reason I am really sorry that I couldn't enlist it in my Top 10 films of last year. But now that I have enjoyed it I am pretty sure that it is in my Top 3, maybe just behind Birdman.Why? Because of the perfect acting lessons displayed in it. Best supporting actor of the year no doubt. J.K. Simmons destroys Miles Teller's character and then builds him depending on Teller's inner talent to produce perfect music. I am really starting to think that most of all I enjoy the overall feel of a movie and then the actors' play. These two factors maybe are the two most interesting and inspiring aspects of a movie for me. And the music of course. Jazz is improvisation, polyrhythm and swing which we have a lot in this wonderful piece of movie history. I have no doubt that 'Whiplash', 'Grand Hotel Budapest' and 'Birdman' will without a doubt find their dignified places in the history of cinema.The intense play is inspired by the beautiful script showing human emotions as we rarely find them in movies. This brilliant acting lesson is a true revelation for both leading actors and the director Damien Chazelle. It is no wonder that the American critics love it so much. It advocates the true statement that no talent can emerge without tons of hard work and practice. But the more compelling storyline is the one which shows us how the character of a person can grow when confronted by a real catalyst - the mentor, the teacher, the challenger. This is what I really liked in this film - the human emotional development within a talented young person. And Miles Teller is such a young talented actor too. So the symbol is perfect.For us Europeans it is really refreshing to see this psychological clash between the two main characters in this movie. All the more challenging is the setting - the stage seems like a gladiators' arena. It is by the end of the movie like a true battlefield! The hero of the story is challenged by this 'villain' - his mentor. And he strives so hard, beyond the flesh and bone, to reach perfection, that he surpasses perfection by the end of this beautifully shot film piece. And the music in this movie is performed so well that it accompanies the characters' journey through this immense psychological arena of 'war'. The interaction in some scenes is so intense that it is simmering with uncompromising sharpness. We are viewing not only the main character's growth, we are seeing our appreciation of hard work grow too. And in a country like Bulgaria this kind of a lesson (although lifelike obvious) should be much appreciated.'Whiplash'professes the things that matter to us and more importantly - how we can achieve them. It is the uncompromising will of our own souls which can only bring us to success and peacefulness. Perfection is not a mirage, it is a state of mind, a focus so clear, that one can achieve only by working hard on his talents. Every day, every second and every way possible. Even beyond the possible...",10,0,2,18 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," I have recently watched 'The Wolf of Wallstreet' and I'd like to share a few thoughts about this movie with you
","Since many critics emphasize on the overall quality of the movie and the artistry invested in it (no doubt about that), I'd like to write about three special moments in this movie which made my day.So behold – SPOILERS are coming!Are you still with me? Good.1. The speeches at the 'Stratton Oakmont' office.There is such an evangelical preaching power beaming from these sequences that even I as a reasonable man feel compelled by the egoistic nature of these motivational statements. Without a single doubt I can say that they represent both the best and the worst sides of the capitalistic culture. We can clearly see how a man can grow wild because of his ego, greed and lust. But without a single doubt I can agree with the director Scorsese that if you show the true nature of things in a comedic-sarcastic manner in the 21st century, you can only benefit from that. And what a performance from Di Caprio. Hands down2. First meeting between Belfort and FBI agent Denham on Belfort's boat.A very aggressive episode in which the viewer can see how the internal tension builds up and blows out between two strong characters. Although pride is the main reason for this wonderfully played confrontation, I can see again the competitive elements of the American culture clash between the two symbols of this adventurous society. Indeed this is a very important nodus in the story.3. The 'crawling' episode when Belfort is trying to stop his buddy Azoff from making a call from his home and the ludicrous fight between them on the floor.This whole scene is exploring the limits of human will to overcome whatever obstacle there is in the name of self preservation. The play is so real that I thought for a moment that Di Caprio and Jonah Hill have experience with such situations (I guess celebrities' life isn't easier than the lifestyle of the main character of this movie). This whole episode is so controversial that I was wondering if I should laugh or cry about it. And after all I chose to laugh.'The Wolf of Wallstreet' is a movie full of obscene content and crazy role playing. The director Scorsese is a bold and adventurous young soul (as always) and I admire him for that. We can all follow his example in our artwork.I guess that most of the people with moral values will condemn this film in a particular way. But it's expected and it's okay. And even though this movie is not THE best film of 2013, to me it has one of the best (if not the best) cinematic incarnations. There are scenes which are truly 'creme de la creme'. Profit and Ego are evident sins, but we all have them, so why moralize on this movie instead of just enjoy its merits and remember the morals at the end. Yes, we know it is bad to make a movie about these fellas (real life assholes), but as a part of our generation we can't stop cheering at all the wrong moments :)",8,9,15,18 January 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The sad story about The Hobbit franchise
","I have just watched the new video game 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the five armies' at the theater and tried to stop myself from writing about it, because this video game does not deserve this attention, but I still am going to do this in memory of Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the rings' which was truly the reason why I gave the new trilogy a chance.'Frodo: I can't do this, Sam.Sam: I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.Frodo: What are we holding onto, Sam?Sam: That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo... and it's worth fighting for.'And this quote says it all...But let me rephrase that. I have just witnessed how Peter Jackson (due to his own meanings or pushed by the new studio bossing around) has beheaded the little faith I had in him. The third Hobbit installment brought me to laughter, anger and almost to tears because of its outright stupidity and insipidness. And to stop generalizing, I'm going to put some points in front. First of all Peter Jackson has indeed committed crimes against the true story and characters from the children's book 'The Hobbit, or There and Back Again'. Too many people have seen this coming since we saw the first movie (which by the way was the least miserable from the three pieces). The imaginative character of Tauriel and the ludicrous relationship between the elf and the dwarf Kili is such a 'gem' in this set of tragic mistakes that I must not say more. Mr. Jackson thoughtfully incorporated made-up parts in the story which didn't only made these movies look silly, but they destroyed his own credibility as a director loyal to Tolkien and to the fans. Yes indeed, three films will make much more money than one film. But this will never bring Jackson to the high place which he held in the hearts of the fans and in the minds of the critics. 'The Return of the King' took all 11 Oscars for which it was nominated namely BECAUSE it was true to the books. J.R.R. Tokien's writings are true mirrors of the human nature and history and are indeed beautiful examples of how a person can relay humanity. None such occurred in at least the second and the third Hobbit films. I think that we saw a fantasy equivalent to the Avengers' stupidity. Still 'The Avengers' was mostly true to its origins. Which is why 'The Battle of the Five armies' cannot win the audience only with perfect character design, major battles, wonderful music and brief winks towards 'The Lord of the Rings'. The intended soul of the new trilogy - the friendship, the loyalty to comrades and keeping the given promise - were vaguely affecting the viewers back at the theater. Not only because the director and the actors did not meant what they were showing us, but also because it was NOT true. There is no such big emphasis in the book on these highlighted moments. Thus there is such a logical fiasco in front of us.Maybe I am too harsh on this movie and on Peter Jackson. Maybe I am just a fan of Tolkien who feels hurt, because the book material of J.R.R. Tolkien was treated like a source of money. But I think that as Sam said before in The Two Towers - 'Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why.' And Jackson just had to do one movie true to the book. Nothing else. Maybe it would have been less successful than the previous trilogy. I think that it would have not earned any awards at all. But it would have been still an interesting piece to be seen and the true fans of Tolkien's work would have liked it. As a matter of fact I think that most of the people would have liked compared to the situation now. The true story is always emotionally overwhelming and mindfully compelling. So what am I holding onto? The good story? The loyalty to the book? No, I am holding onto the truth of creativity and artistry. There is some good in this world and it's worth fighting for!",6,5,8,20 December 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman acting
","I was expecting 'Birdman or (The unexpected virtue of ignorance)' to be a blow up acting lesson, but it really surprised me with its completeness and universal message...Alejandro González Iñárritu really did it well. He is a proved and delightful author and director already, but this movie can really bring an Oscar to Michael Keaton. But let's start with the atmosphere. The set is New York - WOW! I am really impressed how they showed us The Big Apple's artistic district. The camera work is incredible - long shots, beautifully transferring from one scene to another. The moving of the camera is flawless and alive. The viewer really feels the vibrant life of the main characters. And the music is very clever and fitting. Especially the rhythm and the pacing of the action are exact and provoke our emotional reaction almost every time. The whole setting and scenery is creative and true to the Broadway style life.I must say that the main character Riggan (Michael Keaton) and Mike (Edward Norton) play almost perfect embodiments of how the modern actor's behavior. This encyclopedia of decision making and emotionally hazard behavior is tempting the viewer to feel empathy for them. I completely enjoyed their acting and felt that after all the American acting school is not behind the European at all. Hollywood may produce tons of bullsh*t, but Fox Searchlight has proved again its record of good production choices. And the acts in this film are really classical in a way. The falling out of glory struggling Riggan is investing his career and sanity into the play What 'We Talk About When We Talk About Love'. And we can feel the thickness of tension which is building up on his head. The reference to Keaton's actual career is evident, so we feel true empathy to the main character in Birdman. His alter ego - the Birdman is constantly reminding us of the Ego of every actor who has received appreciation, but is craving for more. And Norton's character Mike is truly an expected surprise representing the actors' boldness and ingenuity. The supporting cast - Zach Galifianakis (just wow!), Naomi Watts (the usual delved into character personality), Emma Stone and Andrea Riseborough add to the constellation of stars shining on the stage and on the screen. I must say - with such a cast a good director such as Iñárritu has done marvels of wonder!Maybe I am too exuberant in my rants about this film, but I feel that we're witnessing really a piece which is close to perfection. I really enjoyed it very much and the true reason for that is the script. The story's both particular and general view for modern acting and the current condition of the cinematic industry have really impressed me. Every line is on spot, the ideas are not new, but are presented very fresh. One can only reflect upon the true nature and signification of the theater, cinema and acting as a profession and way of life. Yes, way of life. Because after all, depending on the situation, we all tend to act and react. All humans are actors in a way. And as William Shakespeare has put it eloquently:'All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages.'",10,7,17,7 December 2014
Prometheus," Sci-fi goes undercover
","'Let the adventure begin', says David as the 'Prometheus' approaches an unknown planet. As our imagination approached the universe of the new sci-fi movie of Ridley Scott too. After watching it several times I finally approach reviewing it. There are so many opinions already, that the sea of information is overwhelming the universe created by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof and its message to the viewers. I personally saw the movie at its premiere and was overwhelmed by the amount of creative power in it. Yes, maybe the plot was too questionable, taking in consideration the expectation of the Alien franchise fans. But did we really get a beautiful sci-fi movie with plot holes and some unfinished side characters and relations between them? Or after watching it several times and taking the time to consider all the possible explanations, we can get the enigmatic biblical and existential messages of the writers. Many sci-fi fans believe that this is far from the suspense and dramatic contradiction of the first Alien movie. And even compared to Scott's Blade runner this is a flat plot and unfinished character universe. But it is not. I tried to think of a way to convince you that this is a unique, ethical and philosophical piece of entertainment. And the best is the view of the believer. No matter what you believe in, you always try to doubt and research your own way into the vastness of...yourself? Yes, I am sure that the best way to dissect this movie is from within. The names of the characters, the topical and spacial focal points of this universe, the relations between the people involved in the mission of 'finding God' - they all have some biblical origin. This is a movie about the origin of human faith and its endurance. Every person in the plot has his/her/its own way of testing the belief which holds the human mind together. For some it is the weight of money and power. For others its the scientific method of describing what created us humans. And for some, such as Elizabeth and Janek - it is truly the belief in some greater force. Only David is the neutral child which sees all words and actions without reasoning with death. The birth, the parenthood, the social structure of the crew - everything is perceived through the twisted microscope of fear. After all of the preparedness of the human intellect (even with the saintly David created by humans) the humans are not ready to face their fears without losing their humanity. It is not a logical action, but more emotional reaction which saves Earth from holocaust. And even if the Engineers were ready to destroy our species because of some horrible deed which we did 2000 years ago (guess what it is :)), are we ready to admit that we have done something to prove that it is not the right thing to be done? The main message of this film to me is that we are full of questions to which we don't know the answers, but if we find the courage within ourselves to dig deep enough we will find that the godly sparkle which makes us stand the test of time and continue to evolve further is always what to be human is. To be able to always make a choice to believe in something which may not be true, but still makes our lives meaningful and worthy.",9,4,7,6 July 2013
Mother!," An ode to Mother!
","Officially 'Mother!' comes to the top of my 2017 movies list, next to 'Blade Runner 2049'. I watched a lot of good movies this year, but the only one to come near these two is 'Wind River'. Alas, I still haven't watched enjoyed the biggest hit this year 'The Square' and a lot of other hidden gems like 'Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri', 'Loveless', 'Lady Bird', 'Shape of water' and 'The Florida project'. Yet, I believe that namely 'Mother!' will remain as the most unique movie of this year!Hence forth, please be aware, my post might include some spoilers.I've waited a lot to watch 'Mother!' at last. I've had some doubts that it will be too artsy and too tough on my nerves, but yet again I trusted myself and challenged my intelligence. 
I believe that to every viewer of this movie the director should go and say: 'You're going to watch a dialogue between 'Mother Earth' and 'God'. And this will NOT be a spoiler. This will help a lot of people to view this film the way it should be seen - a deep conversation about our humanity , meaning of life and our place on Earth.
Outright I should say that Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem are truly magnificent actors in this film. Their performances are INCREDIBLE! And such is the script and direction of Aronofsky. His deeply emotional way of reflecting on universal topics and translating them to the audiences in painfully creative manner really brings his art forth.And what a home this filmmaker builds in front of us! The house is also a main character in this film. The constant transformations of the interior and exterior mirror thousands of years of life on Earth. We, viewers have to be indeed grateful for the intimate way visuals change in the movie. I really loved the way the director shows us particular details and how they represent greater ideas. Matter and mind are more or less the same in this film.The sound and cinematography are compelling and add to the whole cosmic experience. I can't say who can express better such topics than Aronofsky. All the allusions to the Bible and to the state of our modern society are on point and the realism with which these topics are represented is truly astonishing. At the end of the movie, when things get really heated the poetic part steps back in order for us to see and hear the crescendo of our interpersonal relationships. It is certain that the author has some messaged to the role of God on Earth and they are firmly stated, no matter if we agree with him or not. Also, 'mother Earth' is represented with deepest emotions and care. The intrusion of our humane nature onto this place we call home is visually represented in a striking way. This movie is an experience, not a mere entertainment product. At some point it is a survival to watch it and stay with it. But it truly will mesmerize every viewer who goes into the theater to learn and absorb new ideas and viewpoints. I can only recommend to watch it in solitude because it is a compelling masterpiece.",10,0,0,23 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force of Star Wars
","So, yes - it's been some time since I wrote here... And I'm sorry to have left this website without any update for a long time. But changes have happened for good and this is good. But everything has its time and now it's time to pay my respect to Disney's Star Wars...I can't really explain in details, but since a child I have felt that 'Star Wars' is bigger than 'Disney'. You might thing this is ludicrous, but it's somewhat true to me. As a child I was exposed to 'Empire strikes back' and I loved every second of it. And after that all the other old movies. It's just that the whole imagination in that trilogy was so enormous that it encompassed me and made me warm back then...and still it is like that.The thing is that after that Lucas made the Prequels which was a good move, a fresh breath and certainly they were written and produced in a respectable manner. The problem is that too much CGI and further lack of acting skills made those films look bad in various ways. You can't say that Lucas made a mistake, he just didn't hit that same spot with the audience.So that interesting point is that JJ Abrams hits that spot with the new movie. And does that using the whole specter of starwarsmanship. He directs good actors, films on beautiful places, gets the right writers...but something is amiss. And it's hard to tell what it is...Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are performing very good. Harrison Ford is stellar as usual. The others - not really adding that much to the on screen chemistry. But anyhow the movie is performing well and strong. The music is enormously beautiful, the shots are spectacular, the details are really cool, and the robots are, of course, adorable.So my final question is - if everything was so good and reminded me of the old Star Wars trilogy that much, why did I feel partly a bitter taste throughout the movie? For now it is hard to explain the reason, but I feel that maybe to keep a person warm, you need to fuel the fire not only with new stock, but to be able to produce flames which were not expected to blow...Perhaps this is why I have so much high hope for the spin off movies... :)",8,1,10,19 December 2015
Cloud Atlas," Anamnesis
","In his dialogues 'Meno' and 'Phaedo' Plato expresses the idea that 'humans possess knowledge from past incarnations and that learning consists of rediscovering that knowledge within us'. That is what the process of Anamnesis is. And I am very much fond of it. That is exactly why I think that the movie (and the book) 'Cloud Atlas' is a masterpiece of both cinema production capacity and storytelling. And not only that, it is a perfect stage for the manifestation of acting talent. That is something which Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy and the rest of the cast undoubtedly possess. We as mortal people tend not to believe in the eternal and transcendent features of our words, actions and essentially of our souls. And that is understandable. One cannot see beyond his judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. This marvelous mosaic structure of the plot seems at first very hard to cope with. But here come Tom Tykwer and the Wachowskis to direct it well enough that it all blends in. The pace of the events in the plot move like a train - first slowly, but then it all speeds up until the characters, the stories and the genres interflow into one parable about love, freedom and the consequences of every choice being made. 'Cloud Atlas' is not only about the immortality of the human soul. It is presenting us the gifts of life that make us human - the values which stick us together around the globe. Such a daring and visual (what incredible make-up and costume artists!) masterpiece does not defy only the usual structure of the narrative, but also (more importantly) our understanding of what is the answer to the eternal question - 'What is the meaning of my life?'. And at the end of the movie we desire to receive a revelation, but instead we get 'a look in the mirror'. This movie is complex in its form, but simple in its substance. Life is what you make it and it's YOUR own choice to make it through violence or LOVE.",10,9,12,11 January 2014
Her," 'Her' as a metaphor for the complexity of the romantic relations
","21st century is the epoch of the information, but is it the century in which we are going to distance ourselves from each other?The science fiction romantic drama shows us a fictional world and characters which make us think about the state of the modern human relationships. This gentle story about the introvert and lonely Theodore and his romantic relationship with the Operating system 'Samantha' is a beautiful expression of love, intimacy and the еvanescence of love and what remains after it is lost to time. We enter this hardly futuristic world with the help of the letters which the main character is writing at his work. The words in them radiate warmth and affection, care and compassion. All these feelings embrace the viewer and take him to the most intimate parts of the human soul. Joaquin Phoenix is marvelous in his play. Every detail of the process of falling in love is depicted so vividly and carefully that we feel the ups and downs of the heartbeat of the main character. The OS is only a voice, but is played perfectly – it builds up an almost real female personality.Then we witness the development of the romantic relationship until it ends just like those in real life. We are engulfed in the emotional turbulence of Theodore. We see his transition into emotional adulthood. His acceptance of the partition with his former girlfriend is a natural conclusion to the story of this film.Here I'd like to express my happiness and gratitude for the choice of filming locations and music – they both feel ambient and natural. I liked the way the director shows us one very possible future which actually is already in development (I am looking at you, 'Google').But what can we learn about the human relationships from this movie? Are we all going to alienate from each other? Are we always going to prefer the romantic past instead of a more mature future? Do we really confide in our egoistic point of view about love and how it develops into loneliness or are we ready to accept the transience of human affection? Can we evolve emotionally or not?It's not so easy to move on, because we feel primordial fear of being alone. It's natural to feel appreciated and to look for a small measure of peace in love. That same love that causes the greatest distress and still fills our lungs with life. I must say – we are constantly part of this roller coaster namely because of our feeling of insignificance. And since it comes from our fear of being forgotten we can only overcome it by creating memories of ourselves into others' minds. Indeed love is the best way to record memories of appreciation about us which can live long after we're gone.This is a delicate story about the human soul",9,2,5,29 January 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," What a lovely day!
","If you haven't watched one of the best action movies this year, go to the nearest 3D movie theater and correct this mistake...It's been a while since I have watched a grand cinematic masterpiece with lots of quality action sequences. Maybe since 'Prometheus'.Anyway, I want to say a few words about the 4th Mad Max movie which is a true heir to the old movies, and especially to the first one. The exhilarating survival story is concentrated on the desert pursuit of our main hero Max Rockatansky who is helping Imperator Furiosa and the beautiful women, who happen to be running from the die-hard Immortan Joe. This being said - there is no more story setting, no time for prehistory, for building characters in the beginning - the action starts immediately. And it is fueled with relentless strive to overcome dire situations with desperate measures. What strikes me most is the visual perfection of the execution of each action sequence. It is real, it is scary, it is fast and it is furious. Yes, the dialogue is not much, and is not that good. But the presence of each character and his/her traits are true, visible and charming. We get to see each of the main characters pursue their way of survival, but in the end only together they can achieve survival and fulfillment. Only Max is the ever estranged and wandering loner.The truth is that this film is not about the depth of its plot, or the growth of a character in it. It is about the unique world in which this survival story is set. It is about the weary road warriors who battle each other over the only true and meaningful things left in the world - water, gas and procreation. Because there is no Green Place, no end destination, no other refuge than the one of the mind. And as the main character is driven by his guilt and the ghosts of his lost relatives, the world in which he lives and wanders is driven by the mad desire to survive, to live, to prevail. This may seem and sound crazy (as crazy as the man with the flame- throwing guitar), but more or less I'm used to see this same battle over and over again in our daily life. We may fight over more elitist values, but survival of the fittest is the most common theme in each argument, in each battle we fight in our lives. Because one can leave his/her legacy only as a victor.No matter how primal it may seem, the message behind Mad Mad is vigorous - through the ecological collapse and moral decadence one can survive only through constant refueling of the inner values and fighting for them. We can truly see the family metaphor with Max, Furiosa and the five wives and War boy Nux in one truck. And the dream of reaching home as a journey back to the beginning after escaping from it.It is very important for me to note the excellent soundtrack and colorful visuals. I very much like this post apocalyptic desert world of Mad Max. The desperation is tempting, the solace is futile. In order to achieve something better, one has to accept the gritty nature of this aggressive world and fight it in every possible way he/she can.This is a weird but grandiose roller coaster journey for the eyes, the ears and the mind. A long expected treasure for the road warriors out there.",9,3,9,21 May 2015
