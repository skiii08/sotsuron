Casablanca," The crazy things people will do for love and business
","Call me dumb but I never knew the movie Casablanca never took place in Casablanca! I was a little disappointed that the movie was in black and white in any case I loved the feel of this movie and the time period aspects such as the clothes and the music it was all to classy and up beat, nothing looked trashy and every one spoke properly. There was no slang like the way people talk today. The way Mr. Rick carried himself made it look like he lives in the lap of luxury and I loved it. Another thing I loved about Rick was how cut and dry he was and how he never wanted to get involved with anyone else's problems Rick was also very sincere and genuine. And in the end he did what was right for everyone! This was a great movie and i enjoyed watching it tremendously!!!",Null,0,2,22 September 2010
Citizen Kane," A boy who went from foster child to newspaper editor
","I honestly did not like this movie. I found I was very antsy during it because it to me was very slow paced and I felt as if it was 'beating around the bush' trying to get to the point. Thinking about the movie now I still don't completely understand everything it contained. Also I found the main character Charles a bit scary with his facial expressions and how mean he became after all of his fame and money. I thought the screen time was way too long and the characters didn't really do it for me. As I said I found Charles scary his first wife ditsy and annoying, Charles mother in the beginning very mean and heartless and only out for her money, and his father seemed like a child beater to me. With that said this may have been the feel the producer and directors were going for. There were some great camera shots when Charles was in his news paper building also when he was running for governor however other than that I saw no greatness to this movie.",Null,0,2,20 October 2010
The Birth of a Nation," The Civil War & the after math of African Americas & the KKK
","So I'm not really into history however this movie helped me understand this time period way better than I have ever learned it in school or read out of a text book. From the battles to the guerrillas revenge to the death of Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Speaking of the president one thing I found funny was that the scene of him in the theater was the exact same one from the movie 'The Gold Rush' it was like it was copied and pasted from one movie to the other. Another thing I'm curious to know is if people during this time were really as scary as they look in the movie or if its just because of the fact that its a black and white film. I'm not sure if there was makeup back then or if the bags under the actors eyes are just because they were tired. I mean seriously the guy who plays the presidents looks so scary; even some of the African Americans don't look real, they look like their skin was painted. On a positive note the background music to this movie was more entertaining because its a bunch of different instruments instead of just piano.",Null,0,2,15 September 2010
Taxi Driver," Love makes you do crazy things
","I felt this movie did a great job portraying New York City during this time period. The movie also did a great job showing just how much war Veterans can suffer after serving their time in the service. Its a harsh reality that most people don't take seriously. Travis had severe sleeping deprivation along with mental issues and I was nervous just watching the movie to see what was going to be his next action. Some of the camera shots that were filmed from the inside of the cab looking out were mysterious looking as well and also had a 'dark side' to them which added to the mis-en-scene. Another aspect I found that was done very well was the NYC street theme; they were dingy, dirty, full of filth, graffiti, drugs, prostitutes. For as twisted as crazy Travis seemed all he really wanted to do was make the world a better place; but it was for a twisted reason; a girl who wanted nothing to do with him. So does that make him crazy or not?",Null,0,0,8 December 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," How a family dealt with the hardships of the dust bowl & loss of work
","This was definitely my least favorite movie we've watched so far this semester. I undersdtand that the point the movie is trying to get across is how hard life was during this time period between the dust bowl and all these people getting forced off of their land because they had no jobs to pay for their homes however it was very drawnout and seemed to take way to long to get its point across and in the end I felt so sorry and almost sick to my stomach because I felt so bad for the poor family. However it may have been what the director had in mind for the movie. also it was very repetitive with all of the hardships the family faced it became almost too predictable, so on the whole I thought the movie was poorly written. On that note the lighting aspects were great such as all of the shots of the sunsets and the rocky cliffs as the family traveled. I also feel as if the movie did a great job making you feel as if you were in all the different camps the family was in.",Null,0,1,12 October 2010
The Graduate," Bow-chicka-wow-wow
","I thought this movie was great all the way around. It had a great story, conflict, some drama, a small love story yet it was funny and classy. It was amazing to see another film in color which demonstrated just how far technology had come. The one scene did a great job breaking the 180 degree rule because it wasn't all that noticeable however it caught my attention. Another important aspect of the movie in which I feel was done to the greatest extent was how the screen play. All of the characters flowed together really well; at certain points of the movie I feel the characters made the audience feel awkward which was great because thats exactly what the writers and directors were going for and it just seemed so real!",Null,0,0,1 December 2010
Psycho," weird doesn't even begin to explain this from the mother to the son
","I absolutely loved the areal view shot of the city in the beginning of the movie. I thought this movie did a great job of being a thriller i felt very anxious the whole time I was watching it. Everyone was very odd, or weird. They all acted strange and antsy. The music helped tremendously with establishing the feel of the mis-en-scene of the movie. As did the vacant hotel, the sketchy police man and the dreary weather. The fast cuts between Marion and the police officer while he was following her added to the 'freaky/ weird' feel of the movie as did all the birds in the mans office at the motel and the yells that came from the house. If I were Marion as soon as I found out that I was the only one stating there i would have left as fast as I could especially seeing how inquisitive the man was. After seeing the shower scene that was shown as an example in the Hitchcock interview I realized just how complex it really was. I think that scene and the areal view scene were my favorite.",Null,0,0,10 November 2010
