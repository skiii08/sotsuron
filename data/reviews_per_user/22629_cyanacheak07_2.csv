The Avengers," Considered one of the best films of 2012
","To start out: The casting was phenomenal. Mark Ruffalo was thought to be a poor choice for the Hulk, but after seeing him in action, the thought had left everyone's mind. Edward Norton, a great Hulk himself, would not have fit in with the team. Now that I even try to think of it, I think this film would not have been nearly as great with him in it.As for the rest of the cast, it was well rounded, well written, and was fairly proportioned, considering the size of the team (No single actor got too much screen time, not even top billed Robert Downey Jr.) Joss Whedon did a spectacular job. No one could've done better. He had the perfect balance of each character, as well as the perfect balance of action and comedy. This film was amazing from start to finish. If you didn't like it, you probably don't like fun.",9,1,4,11 June 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," If you like the Dark Knight, and if you like Batman Comic Books, this is not the Batman film you should see.
","I was so hyped up for this film. I've spent most of my life reading Batman comics, watching Batman movies and TV shows, and just being a huge fan of Batman. When Batman Begins came out, I went and saw it in theaters, and left a little less than impressed. This was not the Gotham City I grew up on. But after reading different graphic novels depicting Batman's growth as a hero, I began to gain an appreciation for the film. I gave it a 7/10.Leading up to the Dark Knight, I kept up closely with the viral campaign, the set photos being released of Ledger as the Joker, etc. I was actually excited for this one. I had grown to love Nolan's Batman, and couldn't wait to see the next film. Seeing it for the first time, it was like watching the perfect film. 10/10.After I started a podcast with my friend Zac (zacandchuck.com, buzzsprout.com/3269) we started to cover everything that came out about the Dark Knight Rises. Bane photos (I defended Hardy), speculation over John Blake (I speculated he would be Azrael), the awaited return of Ra's Al Ghul (Huge letdown. Nolan had the body disappear, foreshadowing... NOTHING.) and the question as to who Miranda Tate was. I predicted that Miranda Tate would be Talia Al Ghul (correctly), and that R'as would return to Gotham to destroy it, using Bane as a pawn. Batman would be injured and would enlist in someone to fight the good fight for him. Seeing Azrael fail, Bruce built up his strength, and went back out to take on the League of Shadows. This is what I thought was going to happen. What did happen, was a messy, long, poorly explained film involving Batman characters doing the opposite of what Batman characters do. Batman had given up. Alfred would go on to abandon him. Bruce retires the fight that is his and only his, and passes it on to someone who isn't trained, and has no business wearing the Batsuit. This film was terrible. The only redeeming factors were Anne Hathaway's performance as Catwoman (I thought she would suck, and she blew me AWAY). and Tom Hardy as the chilling Bane. If you want to see Batman give up, retire, come back, save the day, and give up on avenging his parents death? This is the movie for you. But that is not my Batman.",5,2,6,11 June 2013
