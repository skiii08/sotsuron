The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," The most beautiful movie I've ever watched
","I still remember over 10 years ago watching this movie all alone in a theatre with no one else (Monday afternoon or some other week day time). Irene Jacob, the streets of France and Poland, the editing, the love scenes, the plastic ball reflections, and especially the music all are so beautiful that actually made me shivered and stunned.Kieslowski's in another world now.  I always worry whether it's possible to watch another movie that struck me so badly.  A million thanks to him for showing me the most beautiful film of my life (probably).
p.s. this film has only been released in VHS - so ridiculous, a shame of the industry.",9,113,141,18 March 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Why still care at the verge of human extinction?
","<ul><li>When the erratic climate is in the course of wiping out the entire Northern hemisphere, do I still care to see a man WALKING from D.C. to N.Y. so as to check out IF his son is dead? </li></ul><ul><li>Do I still care to see the puppy love and kisses between two American high school kids, when the entire Europe is under 15 feet of ice?</li></ul>This film has started with a good idea and mouth-watering CGs. It can probably go on to explore issues like religion, human migration to third world countries, changes to mankind, the helplessness of human being, but..................Funny to see the Hollywood sign being shredded.",7,0,0,26 May 2004
