Vertigo," One of Hitchcock real masterpieces
","Hitchcock's masterpiece about a retired police detective with fears of heights. He is hired by a friend to shadow his wife which has acted very strange lately.This is a movie that demands very much of the viewer. You have to watch all of the movie - and you certainly will. Because this movie will spellbind you for two hours.Many critics think the first half hour is slow and many minutes could have been cut. But in fact these scenes are necessary for the whole movie to work. And by the way, the beginning is not boring. It's like the beginning of Psycho - it slowly builds up and is therefore necessary to understand the whole picture.The movie is like a boiling soup that will boil over at any minute. Both Psycho and Vertigo explode in the end (not a bomb!). Leaving the audience stunned by the end. (Like Norman's corpses in Psycho) and Jeff (James Stewart in Vertigo).Vertigo is definitely one of the best movies ever made. YOU MUST SEE IT!!! I had to watch it twice to understand what a masterpiece this is.Jonas Sörensen, August -98",10,4,4,16 July 1999
Taxi Driver," The fine thing about this movie is not on the outside, it's on the inside.
","Dark story about a taxi driver (Robert DeNiro). Workling late at night.                    he discover the true world of New York - a dark and cruel experience.                      Prostitutes, drugdealers - total chaos. In desperacy of love, he find his                      woman, working i a place where they promotes the new president.                      But after a while she discover she's nothing for him.                    Each move that DeNiro does equalls a move to loneliness and desperation.                      From the 'sophisticated' girl to the 'porstitute' girl. This will                      reach it's climax, which is not a pleasure to watch.                    At the same time we feel sorry for this man. Why does he have to live like this?                      His heart is filled with love, but you won't see it at first.                    Taxi Driver is not a joy to watch, it's not a movie you like. It's a deep and hard                      movie to see, it's a tragic to watch how this good hearted man                      goes down the drain, as you can express it.                    Scorsese has made a real and rare movie, I think you shall see it. But don't                      come back and say that it wasn't good. The fine thing about this                      movie is not on the outside, it's on the inside.",Null,0,0,9 August 1999
The Graduate," A gripping story about a boy seeking the true love.
","Dustin Hoffman plays a young naïve boy, turning 21. After a party he drives one of his family's friends, a middle aged woman played by Anne Bancroft, home. Telling him that she is afraid of the dark she 'forces' him to follow inside the house. Because her husband isn´t coming home for hours she wants Hoffman to stay. In some way she manages to get Hoffman in their bedroom, she is undressed and wants to have sex with the young Hoffman. Hoffman denies of course. Later in the film they will have sex. Bancroft is living in a marriage absent of sex and feeling attached to Hoffman. He, i think, to get over his shyness and his virginity.Hoffman's family, not knowing anything, thinks that he should get out with the daughter (of whose mother he has had sex with..) and they arrange a date. Hoffman and the daughter fall in love...The film made Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross (who plays the daughter) overnight stars. The movie earned an Oscar for Mike Nichols direction, and 5 other nominations including Best Picture. Simon & Garfunkel sing the soundtrack which includes many wonderful songs like The Sound of silence, Scarborough fair and Mrs. Robinson.This is a gripping story about a boy seeking the true love. Because this is a comedy, not a tragedy, he will of course find his love. But to come to that happy ending you have to go through a story with betrayal, loneliness, hate and anger. And it's sure worth to do that.",Null,0,1,9 August 1999
Shine," David, a young Australian boy, discovers he's got...
","David, a young Australian boy, discovers he's got a gift - he can play a piano like a master. When he gets an offer from a music school in London his father gets furious and says he will split the family if he leaves. But the boy leaves and his father is devastated.Shine isn't a typical 'Hollywood' movie about a boy where everything is bittersweet and everyone smiles and says happy things. No, this is a movie about true life and the tough way in growing up and become an adult. It's a story about a boy trying to be accepted in the world.The movie is based on a true story. I don't really know what the plot wants to say, but I have some ideas:1. The family itself is important, therefore you shouldn't move away to another country or so. 2. Not everyone can be famous. 3. Maybe as David's father says in the film: 'Life is a struggle you have to fight'.This is a movie filled with sorrow, happiness and some really good performances, among them Geoffrey Rush as David when he's an adult. The performance also gave him a well deserved Academy Award.Shine is one of those movies that you can watch again, trying to understand it even more.",Null,1,1,9 August 1999
