Conquest 1453," The most amazing movie of the year
","The conquest of Constantinople is Perfectly reflected by the movie. Of course it is impossible to reflect all the details of the history.Especially war scenes are great. Nothing is artificial. You feel like you are about to fifth and get into the war. It feels real! Love? Of course! Admiring love which is pure and brave. I watched the movie last night. Today, I am still watching the trailer. I am planing to watch it again following days, cause it feels very nice while watching. High on the tiptoe of expectation movies...Although there may be some missing historical events, it still Goose pumps! Takes about 2,5 hours but there is no boring scene. Believe me, it is an incredible movie. Watch it, you will not be Regret.",10,26,66,21 February 2012
