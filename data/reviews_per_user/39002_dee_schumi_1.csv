Ford v Ferrari," Fabulous, freakin awesome!!!
","Fantastic, keeps you on the edge especially during the racing scenes, Christian Bale and Matt Damon deliver strong performances as Ken Miles and Caroll Shelby, this is a must watch movie for all motorheads. Also got to know a bit of history about how Ferrari used Ford to get taken over by Fiat. Racing scenes at the Daytona and at Le Mans were well shot. This has to go down as one of the better roles enacted by Christian Bale post his tryst with DC comics as the Batman.",10,2,4,16 November 2019
