Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Brilliant
","Hysterically funny - and tragic in it's exposing of ignorance and deep seated bigotries. For all of you who cry that America is better than portrayed - grow up and face the fact that ignorance and prejudice live everywhere. More importantly, learn to laugh at it if you are so offended by it. Ignorance is the worst and most dangerous situation for all human beings - it deserves only ridicule and repair. The current chic of political correctness is almost more damaging than ignorance itself. Bigots and fools have been forced back into the closet - and people still do and feel the same awful things while they make sure that the use the politically correct terminology to cover their hypocrisy. Learn to laugh at yourself, and get a life. This movie is funny.",10,35,47,31 October 2007
