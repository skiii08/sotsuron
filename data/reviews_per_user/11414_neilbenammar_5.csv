The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Mockingjay Part I fundamentally fails to capture the essence of Rebellion.
","Now before the Hunger Games fans try to gut me for this review, bare in mind I am writing this review without having read the books- which may or may not cloud my judgment, depending on different opinions. Firstly, I would like to preface my review by pointing out that compared to the shallow garbage we see nowadays the Hunger Games franchise is considerably better both in its ability to convey emotion and assert compelling themes ( FYI: they are also coherent). It has been a while since we've discovered a tale of tyranny - via the abuse of power, told from the perspective and voice of the people being subjected with violence. The theme of Injustice has been tackled countless times by Hollywood studios over the years and 90% of the time it was misrepresented or wrongly/poorly depicted. The strength of the Hunger Games is that the underlying motive of Revolt drives every character's story-arc and as a consequence universalizes the plight of the 13 Districts. From the very start of the trilogy, Katniss Everdeen brought conflict straight to the Capitol as soon as she won the Games. Her act of defiance not only sparked a series of events but it eventually exposed the autocracy of the Government- all this purely by accident ( Katniss reminds everyone in this third installment that initially, she did not willingly want to cause the uproar in Panem). Ironically, Katniss volunteered to fight in the Games, however she is made a symbol of the Mockingjay Rebellion involuntarily. Most audiences will be moved by the emotional journey Katniss undergoes throughout the film- however it was paramount for Francis Lawrence to capture the rebellion of the districts with the utmost sincerity and power. Unfortunately, he ultimately fails to do so. What works in the Hunger Games is that it explores an enthralling and extremely vivid background/back-story- namely 'The Districts, their diverse terrains and their inhabitants'. For instance, in 'Catching Fire'- we had a glimpse into the lives of the people living in District 12( and some other Districts such as 8)- this made us empathize with the characters at the helm of this blockbuster because it gave the plot a humane cause. The brave and hard-working people of Panem were given a soul and not just Hollywood props to play around with. To be quite frank, I was quite skeptical to watch Catching Fire after I heard Gary Ross was not attached to direct. Fortunately, to my surprise, Francis Lawrence did an outstanding job and kept the series with a fervent sense of conviction and audacity. Francis Lawrence's greatest accomplishment with Catching Fire was that he explored a plausible juxtaposition of sorts, which was: while The Capitol tried to dehumanize the people under its rule they gained the bravery to humanize their cause through the eyes of innocent Katniss Everdeen. This might sound complicated to understand but at its core is the primary motor for the denouement of the story. The political undertones of the Hunger Games have always been present in the shadows- this made it more than interesting for Lionsgate ( the film production company behind the Hunger Games phenomenon), as they had a young adult adaptation, which at the time of release, coincided with the political issues of today's day and age. From the very beginning, Mockingjay Part 1 had a daunting task to extend both visually and spiritually the magnitude of Panem's universe; in order to give us a look into the mind of the Rebellion- both through Katniss' eyes and the individuals who rally behind her. All in all, the essence of the Hunger Games was not entirely there as the movie failed to capture the Mockingjay Rebellion with enough heart and insight. That being said, I still think the first 2 installments deserve all the praise they get for defying the Hollywood 'status-quo' and I'm glad The Hunger Games trilogy was acquired by Lionsgate-( a smaller independent studio compared to the normal typical 'powerhouses') as they kept the movies relatively in-sync with the books and allowed both Gary Ross and Francis Lawrence to portray Panem without any influence from higher-ups( to a certain extent of course ). I certainly hope that when Mockingjay Part II hits theaters at the same time next year, we will dive back into a truthful and honest representation of the people of Panem and their fight against injustice. Finally, although Katniss singing 'Hanging Tree' evoked the main ideas behind the revolution- the rest of the film falls short trying to do so.",6,24,50,22 November 2014
Interstellar," Christopher Nolan's mind transcends the space-time continuum.
","Christopher Nolan is a true contemporary artist and his works have conquered nearly every genre and facet cinema has to offer. Movie-goers have been engrossed by the diverse film repertoire this visionary has created ever since 'Memento' hit movie screens roughly 14 years ago. Monumental hits such as 'The Dark Knight' or 'The Prestige' have been critically acclaimed while maintaining triumphant box office numbers. Some might say Christopher Nolan has earned the nickname: 'Mr.Blockbuster', others might say this is degrading. But all can agree- what makes Nolan's films so memorable is the complexity of his creative pallet and imagination. The back-story of Interstellar was kept under wraps until its release. For the most part, no one knew what they were going in to see- except for the fact that it was a Christopher Nolan film. This was enough to get me through the door ( I'm also guessing most of you as well). We all expected to find a sensational yet unpredictable plot lying at the heart of the movie.The next obstacle on Christopher Nolan's list was Space. A realm many legendary filmmakers have tried to subdue. After we all thought he couldn't top his stellar story-telling abilities....BANG, comes Interstellar. And oh boy it couldn't have come sooner! A definite candidate for the best picture Oscar-race come February .This inter-galactic epic literally and physically surpasses the boundaries of time, space and gravity. Although the flaws and inconsistencies of Interstellar cannot at times be overlooked and may even overshadow its genius- one may not deny the fact that Mr.Nolan has forever re-defined and completely mastered the science-fiction genre. This immersive experience is relatively close to dethroning Stanley Kubrick's: ' 2001: A Space Odyssey ', who as well was ahead of its time. One simply cannot compare Interstellar to most cinematic journeys we encounter every year because it is so far ahead of its league; HELL it is from another planet! (no pun intended).The most riveting aspect of Mr.Nolan's latest creation is his ability to convey such a powerful message about the human condition. Any bystander can attest to the fact that Interstellar really makes you put things into perspective. Especially considering how insignificant the problems we encounter in our daily lives are. We are nothing but tiny specks of dust in the midst of the infinite and vastly superior universe of galaxies that surround us. Lastly, Mr.Nolan does not stop at keeping us in awe of the spectacular visual effects but reaches even further to interweave the motifs of humanity and technology into one. We can only be left to wonder and ask ourselves: To what extent are humans able to co-exist with machines and where will this union take us in the future? There are endless possibilities and our brains cannot possibly fathom the issues Nolan raises in this film. Nolan's superb depiction of technology as a primal necessity for humanity is captivating. His profound allegory for Interstellar: comparing technology as the savior of humanity- serves itself as a paradox. Humans have created technology to move forward; we need it to progress and to evolve but we always seem to question the mechanics/logistics because- and this is what Nolan re-iterates in Interstellar- machines have one enigmatic flaw: no matter how advanced we built them to be, they will always neglect the rationale of fear and love. This is what drives Cooper to save mankind- all so that he could see his children one last time. This is an absolute truth to being human, it is our greatest reason to live yet serves as our greatest weakness. It is what makes us human and ultimately different from robots.All in all, to whom it may concern and to those that are hesitant to go see this picture- a couple words of advice: psychologically prepare for this voyage through time and space but be wary: minds will shatter. A pure mind-boggling puzzle turns out to be a Tour De Force of modern-age cinema. Who's have thunk it ? Perhaps its only flaw might be that it made me waist hours after seeing it trying to make sense of all this scientific non-sense about the theory of relativity, gravitational pulls etc.. you get the point. The whole science background- which plays a substantial part in the film and is equally important- is still a bit new to me.Nevertheless, if you haven't had a chance to see it you deserve to stay and die on earth while the rest of us namely your so called 'space explorers' will join Mr.Nolan and the rest of the cast aboard the endurance.Sincerely,An admirer of beautiful filmmaking and Sir Christopher Nolan.",10,2,7,22 November 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Consensus: A billion-dollar sequel that needs to scale itself down to reality.
","Avengers: Age of Ultron is the Marvel Studio's movie equivalent to Hulk. It is big, fierce and green (translates to a lot of money), yet it is devoid of any real emotional component. The stakes are definitely higher as our favorite band of superheroes team up once again to take down another noteworthy adversary: Ultron. Unlike previous enemies in the MCU, the mischievous robotic creature voiced by James Spader, was created by error from the tasteful mind of Tony Stark. Ultron's inception was triggered by Dr. Banner's and Mr.Stark's dream of upholding world peace- well not exactly. Their ambitions were misplaced; when they decided to pursue the route of artificial intelligence and integrate it in Stark's already existent peacekeeping program (controlled by Jarvis). When things take a turn for the worse, Ultron misbehaves and chooses to go out on a bender to destroy mankind rather than protect it. Now that we have established the premise, let me start my review. Comic-books are a strong source material considering we have the technological advances in filmmaking today- to reproduce our favorite characters with pinpoint accuracy. However, CGI or computer generated images, should be complementary to these Marvel films and should not dominate every facet of them. In Captain America: The Winter Solider, we discovered the promising new face of the MCU and the capabilities of Kevin Feige and his team to deliver great pieces of cinema- while using the everlasting IP (intellectual property) from Marvel comics. The movie was grounded in reality and the CGI did not overshadow the spy and political undertones present in the film. Fast- forward to the release of the Avengers sequel- expectations were high, the crowd wanted the same dark tone the trailers promised and expected Marvel to continue on the great path forged in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.The Avengers are starting a dangerous precedent for upcoming blockbusters. Let me clarify what I mean- there will be a point in the near future where only a handful of directors or creative geniuses will be able to take these comic-book franchises further (by creating unique films). You can't just keep on increasing the stakes (CGI, scale, plot, enemies you get the picture) and expect people to pay to see the movie. Let's assume Captain America 2 was not directed by - the Ruso brothers. What would that signify for the MCU? Specifically, what would happen to the future blockbusters at Marvel Studios? People generally think that one director (or in this case a pair of directors) is not able to change Marvel's strong fan-base and that die-hard geeks will continue to surge into the theaters at every MCU film release. I strongly feel that at this stage - you need visionaries to take comic-book characters and revolutionize them. Otherwise, you will be left with films like Age of Ultron- a fun popcorn flick with a substantial lack of ingenuity.Studios expect a return on investment just weeks after a blockbuster like Age of Ultron opens. This can put an extreme amount of pressure to succeed on the director- in this case, Joss Whedon. There is no magic formula to gross $1Billion Dollars at the box-office, however there are ways to increase your odds. One way is to hire a competent and shrewd individual such as Christopher Nolan- who will take a source material, re-imagine it and deliver a chef-d'oeuvre in the process. Nolan applied real world dilemmas we face in the 21st century (crime, corruption, identity-crises) and integrated them seamlessly into the script. That's how you get a Dark Knight. Marvel Studios definitely does a great job at trying to hire actors and directors that are more-than-qualified to be in the MCU- however their approach is becoming too mainstream. Let me elaborate, they are recruiting guys like Joss Whedon- who despite knowing the comics well and having had directing credits in the past- is not a GENIUS VISIONARY. You need artists that are willing to take risks and create their own universe, not just the Marvel Universe- their personal vision for the film. For example: James Gunn tried doing just that with Guardians of the Galaxy and it turned out to become a sleeper-hit in 2014. Bottom-line, the films in the MCU need to be personal and cannot be controlled frame-by-frame by studio execs who have no artistic integrity and definitely do not have the talent necessary to release masterpieces.In conclusion, Age of Ultron falls in the category of films that are not particularly memorable, and that's all that should be said about it. This is a bad indicator for Marvel- who wants to take this franchise into new dimensions (literally and figuratively). The lesson here: hire an average filmmaker and you get a mediocre product.",6,3,8,9 May 2015
Deadpool," Consensus: Deadpool tries too hard to mock the properties that have preceded it, losing potency, originality and its identity in the process.
","Ryan Reynolds in a spandex-ish tight superhero suitdoes this movie deliver? Let's find out.I think Deadpool definitely is a strong addition to the comic-book movie-verse, boasting strong performances and above-average action set pieces. Does it do enough as a Deadpool origins story? Not quite. Deadpool is far too self-aware for its own good. The film tries so hard to be different it actually disappointingly falters in its attempt to be original. The director seems too inexperienced to accurately meld all the wild elements in this fun and quirky Deadpool script. The writers of 'Zombieland' nail the one-liners and most of the self- referential sadomasochistic non-sensical commotion that goes with it. Is there such a thing as trying to be TOO cool? Pop-culture is pop-culture for a reason. Quotable film lines are deemed classics because of the audiences that make them so. You can't coerce your way into pop-culture fandom, rather you earn your place there. All in all, Deadpool had me leaving the theatre with ambivalent feelings. I do not know exactly where I stand when it comes to liking an anti-hero who keeps on reminding us he is a reluctant superhero while being in a spoof movie of the subject he is making fun of. Does that make any sense? The film definitely is a satire of the comic-book superhero formula; alas the execution of that satire is far from perfect. Deadpool is enjoyable for its jokes and to watch Ryan Reynolds sadistically inflict pain on his bevy of hopeless criminals- I think the audience secretly felt more pleasure as we watched him ingeniously come up with dozens of ways to perform his lethal duties.Fans of the character will be pleased, comic-book movie fans who have an insatiable desire for unconventional chaotic superheroes will also be content with this adaptation, film fans who care about the plot and cinematic elements will be divided on this one. No one likes a smartass, even though it is amusing to watch one in (his) confidence and insanity- capture the screen.",7,3,15,13 February 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Deranged is the new black.
","Dear George Miller, I truly admire your post-apocalyptic take on the future of humanity- it is senseless, spectacular, isolated, barbaric, idyllic, brash, demented, berserk, refined, and nonsensical all in the same breath. Let's try to break this film down into 3 separate plot-points or occurrences. First, Miller immerses us into the wondrous yet disturbing landscape of Mad Max's Australia - a dry and barren futuristic wasteland. The film essentially is one giant tracking-shot for the ages. A video game-like sequence (of sorts) in which our favorite bad boy Max, traverses the unknown territories of Miller's universe- in the hope of helping Imperator Furiosa smuggle wives; belonging to a tyrannical cult leader named King Immortan Joe- from his utopian citadel. If that sentence sounded long and absurd, it's because the plot itself needs psychotherapy. Trying to adequately sum up the storyline is an insurmountable task - thus; let me skip trying to explain it. All you need to know is that it's a mindless car-chase extravaganza that ends with good prevailing over evil. The characters in Fury Road are all over-the-top- simply put: they are just plain fun to look at. The special effects are unfathomable in their grandeur. Yet after all that praise, the film misses the point of what 'itself' is trying to accomplish. I was expecting a catharsis for the character of Max. His moral-ambiguity towards everything he does, anyone he meets, and anything he tries to accomplish - is never truly explained. Let's take for instance, his quite peculiar relationship with Furiosa. Max lives in a world filled with savages that support a madman - yet we do not understand why he chooses to protect Immortan's wives from being captured. He feels conflicted at first, and later just becomes their secret guardian angel. The convolution in the plot is irreparable. If like me, you expected to find a poetic message left at the end of the film - you will be extremely disappointed. I waited and waited for something emotional to happen that would enable me to empathize with these characters. This moment never came. The one underlying problem with Mad Max: Fury Road is that the ideas it presents are so far-fetched and borderline crazy - they detach the viewer entirely from the film. There is no background given to the characters, therefore, all credibility in the storyline is tossed out the window. The journey Max and Furiosa undertake is confusing. The plight of both these characters is not resolved in the end. Furiosa will try to establish her 'Green Place' in an area previously run with violence and cruelty; and Max just wanders off into the sunset - doing whatever he does after that. Which is a way of saying: it's unclear where Max will end up and what tasks lie ahead of him.The practical effects used in some action-sequences are revolutionary. They even hired individuals from the Cirque-du-Soleil to perform some of the stunts. This shows Miller's dedication to create a lifelike universe - where the viewer is expected to spend over 2 hours engrossed inside. However, this universe lacks any sort of human component to it. All the human elements or themes of this film started to develop a deeper significance towards the climax but ultimately were left dying in the dust with car wreckage. The desolate land, George Miller details in the film imparts us with a sense of psychological confusion. The universe of Mad Max is fundamentally flawed- which is the point I think, but Miller neglects the prospect of refining it. He does not explore the motives of the characters inhabiting his canvas. He sets a grimy tone to the universe but fails to justify its purpose or presence.In conclusion, Mad Max: Fury Road is a visually pleasing spectacle but the actors playing the protagonists do a poor job at conveying powerful feelings to the audience. This may or may not be George Miller's fault, but at the end of the day, no one can deny the fact that this film is, and always will be a visual masterpiece. Consensus: A soulless circus that entertains, or a cartoon parody of itself? No one can deny George Miller as a mastermind but I feel even he lost something in the making of this puzzle. Was it his sanity?",7,4,11,14 May 2015
