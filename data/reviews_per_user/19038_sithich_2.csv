The Lobster," Probably the weirdest movie I have ever seen.....
",".....and I have seen Zardoz.'The Lobster' is a weird horrible world where you must pair up or be turned into an animal. Even escaping from the system lands you in the same system, but rebranded. Yeah, it's a social commentary, but I am not sure what it's trying to comment on, except to exhort people to stop living by other people's rules.Everyone is remarkably stupid. The women seem to refuse possible matches, and are also refused, and thus are turned into animals. Unless the point is that they are already animals, in how they behave in this system. Very little humanity is expressed so......Definitely worth the watch, just to see the weirdness of it all. Fair warning It is is dark, depressing, and morbid.",5,1,3,18 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Truly awful
","How can this movie be getting such good ratings? Why did they spend SO MUCH TIME on the lava planet when we KNEW we were there just so Vader could get scarred and get his suit? Just jump in the cock-a-doodle lava already and tell me something about the story I don't already know! Why was everyone able to move about said planet and not even break a sweat--even down near the actual flow? What? No fumes? Did nine months really pass??? I certainly could not tell. I can tell you that I am a mom of full-term boy/girl twins, and when I was Padme's size, I still had 12 weeks to go. No way that tiny tummy produced those gargantuan babies.Now don't even get me started on the 'It's alive' scene with Vader.I was laughing so loud that the guys in front of us turned around and stared at us. It was just awful. Why was he chained to the table? How is it that there are so many fine young actors in the world, and they get one that can't act for Annekin? Can he do anything but glower like a con geek? I certainly had no feeling that he truly loved Padme. Thank god for Ewan McGregor If it wasn't for him, this movie would have been sheer torture to watch.",1,85,159,26 May 2005
