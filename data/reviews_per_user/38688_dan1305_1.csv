Alien 3," Perfect Conclusion
","First of all, I would like to say that I LOVE ALIEN 3.  I love the film as much as the first two, Alien and Aliens, while for Alien Resurrection, well...there's not much I can say than I wish the film was never produced.If you watch all Alien, Aliens, and Alien 3 continuously as one piece of film, you would see how it is a complete, excellent story-line.  I thank David Fincher for deciding NOT to make another Aliens when he was doing Alien 3. The result has made Alien series one of the unforgettable movie series of all time, and certainly one of the sci-fi classics.",10,6,10,24 August 2001
