Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Great Movie But...(Spoilers)
","Vol.2 was a great movie comparable to volume 1 in my opinion. I just had one problem with the movie, how it handled Pai Mei. I felt the training was cut a little short and only so much was hinted at as compared to the original script. Also the way he was killed by poison from Elle was rather weak. Here is a great martial artist,and a mythological figure form old kung fu movies done in by some poison. Kind of a sad end for a figure with such mythology behind him, Also it was sad that the chapter 'Can She bake a cherry pie' and the duel between alburt and bill were cut. Hopefully when more comprehensive dvds for the two movies come out we will get better clarity on all these omissions and changes Other than that great saga, anyone else feel the same way?",Null,0,1,16 April 2004
