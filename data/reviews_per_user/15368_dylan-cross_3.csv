Lucky Number Slevin," Great crime drama.
","What made this a pretty dynamic movie was the quality of acting delivered by Freeman, Hartner, Kingsley, Willis, and Liu; along with a good supporting cast, the actors played their parts well and with the right amount of realism without overdoing things. As far as the story itself is concerned, I was quite impressed by the central plot as it was allowed the chance to blossom into an elaborate network involving murder, manipulation, obsession, and redemption. Without giving away much of the story, this is a movie mainly about revenge, although you don't see that right away until the end.I'd have to say that my favorite character in the movie was Lindsay (Liu). Amongst all of the violence and seedy corruption, Lindsay was a character that gave different insights into the story itself. To a small but significant extent, Lindsay plays a special role in Slevin's salvation and redemption despite the fact that he's quite possibly an individual with psychopathic tendencies.Willis does a great job portraying Mr. Goodcat and we see that in addition to being very intelligent and manipulative he has a few redeeming qualities that play significantly within the story.Although this movie is mainly about good old fashioned revenge, it does a great job exploring the boundaries of its characters and how each character plays significantly in the lives of the other people involved. Clearly this is a character driven movie with great and humorous dialog. I was definitely impressed.",8,0,2,24 September 2006
Crash," An intense collage of stories set in Los Angeles suburbia.
","For the past five years or so, Hollywood has been producing quite a few movies that deal with 'character clashes', usually within the backdrop of a large city. In these types of films characters from a variety of backgrounds 'clash' together during key points in the film as the result of sporadic, short term conflicts. 'Crash' presents a diverse set of characters ranging from street detectives to doctors in a pivotal film that gives us a glimpse of racial tensions and their complexities. The biggest aspect I loved about this movie is that it presented the biases and stereotypes harbored by everyone in Los Angeles without attempting to get at a moral solution to the problem. I think the story specifically attempted to show what people do in unpredictable situations and how they deal with those situations accordingly. By watching this film, the viewer is not subjected to a detailed morality lesson, but instead gets the perspective of all of the characters and how those perspectives conflict with other people in the story.Among the backdrop of racial tensions, we're also presented with other problems the characters face, and within that context, we seem to understand their motivations a lot better. Some of the main problems presented in the film are of a housewife unhappy with her marriage and herself, a detective that has no idea how to console his mother, and an Iranian family living in the shadow of fear and paranoia.I'm really glad I got a chance to finally see this because the characters are very impressive in their performances. Also, we see a lot of unexpected twists of fate that turn up at the most inopportune times, thus further fueling the film's effect on the audience. Unfortunately, at the end there were a few obligatory 'tear jerker' scenes in the story which I thought were unnecessary and this ultimately identified the film as resembling other Hollywood spawns. However, my final vote is that this movie was gripping, visually impressive, and an awesome work. 8 of 10.",8,0,4,21 December 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A very careful look at paranoia and American censorship.
","After so many years of watching David Strathairn perform in many supporting roles, it was very satisfying to see him play the lead part of Edward Murrows, a 1950's news commentator who eventually went to take on Senator Joe McCarthy and early American censorship. Personally, I thought the film was very brilliant and a nice portrayal of an America caught on the skids of post-war paranoia. What makes this movie so pivotal is the fact that it presents two key arguments to the viewer: the responsibility of journalists to report on major, meaningful issues and the relationship between the bureaucracy and the media when those issues are brought forth. The movie also serves as a haunting allegory of today's America and the state of paranoia its citizens still find themselves contending with.The story initially takes off in 1958 when Murrow delivers a speech before an audience of prominent journalists as to the responsibility of the media with regard to investigating and presenting credible stories to the American people. After the opening of the speech, the film jumps back to 1953 and into the days Murrow had while working as a commentator for CBS. Already a prominent figure on American TV sets, Murrow and his producers agree to air one of their first controversial pieces: the story of an Airforce lieutenant forced to resign because of his father's alleged ties to Serbia. While not a direct attack on McCarthy, the piece does place scrutiny upon the US government and its methods. It also poses the question of how well a citizen's rights are protected when certain expressions are deemed unpopular or sensitive. Can a person become a security threat solely because of what they read? Does the government protect our civil liberties only when it serves as a convenience? From this point the film explores the inner workings of the Red Scare and goes to show how vulnerable the media was during that period. Strathairn excels in portraying Murrow as the stern, articulate, and no-nonsense journalist that he was at the time. It also delves into the internal structure of America's bureaucracy and shows how easily the media can be manipulated.Aside from the arguments put forth in the film, its structure was put together very well. Also of note was the great supporting cast and Clooney's directing talents. One of the best philosophical movies that I've seen in a while. 9/10",9,1,2,14 March 2006
