The Incredible Hulk," great fun!!
","Well just returned from seeing it the cinema in South Korea and really enjoyed it. As it goes without saying it this is a big improvement over the 2003 hulk although i did like certain aspects of that movie ( the hulks 'flying jumps' in the desert, the split screen, Jennifer Connelly) Ed Norton again delivers, special effects are good, action sequences really give that sense of awe and I loved Tim Roth, good to see the bad guy actually being a physical match for the hero. Overall it deserves to do well, it was loads of fun and I actually enjoyed IT more than Ironman which I found a bit cheesy but great mostly due to Robert D.JR",8,4,10,12 June 2008

","Is it the greatest movie ever? No, it's not even close BUT in terms of creating a new world ala the original star wars and in terms of being easy to watch so it makes back its money so that other original ideas (as in not based on a pre-existng property) will get a shot and really taking people on a 2 1/2 hour journey to a new world, it is a success. If it didn't do these things then it wouldn't have made the money it has. There have been other J.C films I have enjoyed more but guess what: Guys our age thought the first Star Wars movie was predictable and clich√©d and only something to look at as well. Time will tell on its importance to people. The fact is the general public don't care about what fan-boys think and don't care either who James Cameron is. They want to be entertained and moved and they have been and I was. I mean it's not Transformers 2, this is a blockbuster movie with heart and soul and brains. I think it is meant to be predictable because like star wars it is based on the classic hero tales of old. It follows a traditional story arc. Go in expecting to see a great movie, turn your brain down and your heart up (meaning that it is clearly meant as an emotional rather than intellectual experience) and you will enjoy yourself. Haters want to hate (clearly the movie is not a 2/10, I mean do you think you know better than most of the great BLOCKBUSTER directors who think its amazing)because it popular and lover want to love it because its popular. Enjoy for what it is.",8,1,6,3 January 2010
