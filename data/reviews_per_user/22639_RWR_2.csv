The Blair Witch Project," The success of Blair Witch demonstrates the power of media hype.
","The success of The Blair Witch Project demonstrates the power of media hype.  These three verbally-challenged student filmmakers are among the least interesting film characters of the year.  Their quest for the Blair Witch lacks thrills or terror, largely because of the lack of exposition on the subject.  The nausea-inducing camera work is sophomoric and finally boring. I was ready to leave after the first half hour and had to fight to stay awake to the end of the film.  I wish I had taken thetime I wasted on this film to see Eyes Wide Shut for the fourth time.",3,0,1,7 August 1999
Notting Hill," An innocuous trifle
","Although she denies it, Julia Roberts portrays herself and Hugh Grant, yet again, plays a befuddled English bloke, this time the owner of an unsuccessful travel bookstore.  Hollywood meets Notting Hill and it's all very predictable.  The supporting cast of kooky characters are not enough to add substance to the film which ultimately is not much more than an innocuous trifle.  It would have been much more interesting if we had learned how these two lead characters really felt about the situations into which the script cast them.  Instead we get the usual Hollywood ending.",6,0,0,6 June 1999
