Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," a GREAT film that never gets old
","OK first of all Borat is in a league of its own, there has never been a movie that touched how its filmed, at some parts i found myself laughing beyond control. With that aside Borat is about a guy from Kazakhstan who comes to America to report and learn from us, but he gets caught up into a quest to get Pamela Anderson. Lets be honest your not going to the film for the story but the story is not important anyways you came to see this film to laugh and you will be doing that from beginning to end. If you have not seen it make plans to because it is worth every penny you will spend to watch it. If i were to grade it id give it a 10 because this movie is one of a kind and is most likely the best comedy of the year.",10,2,14,9 December 2006
Hostel," ELI ROTH IS TWISTED...........in a good way
","I'm going to put it straight Eli Roth is one of my favorite horror directors today, and so far love all his work. After watching cabin fever, i had high hopes for this movie and exceeded my expectations.There are many aspects that make this film good, but one is of the outstanding features are the characters, All of them you cared about. When they started killing them off i was upset, and when finally at the end he killed the killer i satisfied me, and made the movie more complete. To conclude this is the best gore film of that year and has become a classic in my DVD collection, horror fans should check it out.",8,7,10,19 December 2006
300," Better Than LOTR
","Let me start of by saying wow, i just witnessed a blessing to my eyes and ears, with that aside 300 will go down as one of the best actions movies ever. LOTR has nothing on this ( i myself not being a big fan of the LOTR trilogy) this movie really puts A lot of action pact scenes and still manages a deep story. Also the sound effects are amazing, swords clanking, men screaming, explosions, and not to mention a good musical score. This film is as epic as it gets, and despite what critics say it is a good film and is made for all movies fans. PS please do not see this film if your offend by decapitation because it happens a couple of times in the film, and a couple of limbs are removed as well",10,2,11,9 March 2007
Donnie Darko," Excellent Film
","What can i say that hasn't been said about this film? Well anyways i think Donnie darko was the biggest surprise in a movie i had ever seen. When i heard all the hype about it i figured it was to good to be true, but i was wrong and after i watched it i had Donnie darko fever, cause i could not shut up about it. Donnie Darko is one of those films you can discuss for hours cause it has a lot of mystery and has a broad plot.I suggest this to everyone, except people who don't enjoy a intellectual film, or a film with profanity cause they do use harsh language but it dosn't bother. Other than that everyone should enjoy this film.",10,1,4,31 December 2006
