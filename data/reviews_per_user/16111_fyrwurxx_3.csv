United 93," Gives the phrase 'based on a true story' new meaning
","There is nothing Hollywood about this film. In fact, it breaks many of the cinematographic rules we've come to accept as requisite in great film-making--but when one views this unrelentingly gripping account of the flight that fought back, you'll forget all about that.Much of the cast is comprised of the real men and women who responded to the 9/11 hijackings in flight operations or the military -- a symbolic testament to the gritty realism and uncompromising attention to fact and detail the filmmakers endowed in the film United 93.It is not the best movie I've ever seen, but it is definitely the most realistic. There is no fanfare or sensationalizing. There is no hurrah, no uplifting conclusion to leave the audience appeased. It is a breathtaking, heart-wrenching account of what happened on that flight. I wholeheartedly encourage everyone to see it, if not for the firsthand perspective it offers, see it at least out of respect for the families of the people who lost their lives that day.",8,1,4,29 April 2006
Jarhead," More than meets the eye
","Mendes is most famous for directing films which defy social norm in terms of genre. American Beauty transcended the usual pigeonholes constructed by the modern movie-making community, and Jarhead follows suit.I would not classify Jarhead as a war movie except by merit that it takes place during Desert Storm and involves United States Marines. Jarhead is a movie about people and what war (and the military mindset) does to the human beings who fight it, not about how much theater blood and computer-generated carnage they can cram into 120 minutes. If this is what you expect, then save your money.Taken not as what one might like it to be and rather what it is, I find Jarhead to be, while no means perfect, a fitting addition to the modern war movie library. The acting and cinematography are exceptional; Jamie Foxx adds a very nice touch to the lineup as the Staff Sergeant in charge of the other 'jarheads.' Character development is meticulous, sometimes too much so at the cost of pace, but in the end the effort is not in vain.I think the biggest drawback to the film's potential success is its somewhat misleading nature: a movie about Marines in Desert Storm demands violence abound, and this is no doubt what many people will see it for. In their unfulfilled expectation of this, they will miss the underlying subtleties each well-acted, beautifully shot scene has to offer. Many will jeer it as a film attempting to reproduce Full Metal Jacket and failing miserably, but chances are those people never saw American Beauty and don't see films for artistic value. In fact, I would even consider the movie to be anti-climactic, but again, that's assuming expectations that the film never promised to begin with.Not Mendes' finest movie, but far from terrible and one I found very enjoyable.",7,1,3,5 November 2005
300," Visually stunning, artistically lacking
","A fan of the earlier film adaptation of Frank Miller's work, Sin City, I held rather optimistic expectations for the highly-touted bloodbath '300.' As nearly anyone who's seen it will attest, 300 is a stupendously stunning visual accomplishment. The visual effects, color themes, sets and most props and costumes blended seamlessly to create an awe-inspiring spectacle of war portrayed candidly.But my accolades cease here.Beyond its gritty, ultra-violent visual appeal, 300 leaves much to be desired in nearly every other relevant category. Chiefly, its portrayal of the Battle of Thermopylae does not hold true with many historical facts of the real battle. Leonidas fights alongside a larger, albeit less skilled, horde of Arcadians in the film, when in actuality King Leonidas rallied his Spartans alongside hundreds of very capable Mantineans, Thebans, Phocians, Corinthians and Phlians, just to name a few.Secondly, the thematic element which attempted to establish identity with the viewer, that of 'patriotism' and 'freedom at all costs,' defeats itself and leaves a hollow void, severely detracting from the film's emotional appeal. I reason thusly: the writer goes to great pains to illustrate the disciplined, war-driven Spartan way of life: that of constant training for battle and absolutely no room for emotion; a culture utterly devoted to the study of warfare and the art of killing. According to 300, Spartans live to kill, and for no other reason (this 'fact' is further reinforced by the scene where Leonidas and his detachment encounters the Arcadians for the first time).Yet contrast this thematic element to the aforementioned theme of raging patriotism and the rallying cry of a free people to resist tyranny and subjugation at all costs, and we're left with all the emotionally moving effect of a paralyzed dog trying to chase a dead cat. Why should I feel sympathetic to the freedom and independence of a nation that prides itself *solely* on the destruction of others? I paraphrase Leonidas' rallying cry to his troops, and the moral underpinning of 300: 'Let's fight and die for our right to fight and die!' Theme aside, 300 suffers from almost total lack of character development or compelling developments to the plot. The audience breaks from the incessant, gratuitous, utterly unrealistic portrayal of spraying blood only to witness a thin subplot involving Leonidas' wife and a treacherous member of the Spartan senate. All else barely qualifies as mere story-building or plain filler. The audience does not leave the theater with any meaningful understanding of actual tradition or culture from ancient Greece, yet leaves quite reassured that all ancient Persians were incompetent, foolhardy and inhuman.Summarily, 300 offers quite a scrumptious treat for those expecting 117 minutes of brutal human slaughter captured in Matrix-like slow-mo camera style drenched in copious amounts of computer-generated blood. But to those who enjoy depth, historical accuracy, plot variation and emotional prowess in their films, 300 will certainly not impress you.",6,4,11,26 March 2007
