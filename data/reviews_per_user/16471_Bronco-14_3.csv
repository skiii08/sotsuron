The Blair Witch Project," Way too overhyped but original-- ** out of ****
","First of all, the movie is not scary at all.  I don't really know why it was rated R.  Of course, the movie had profanity but it didn't have as much to get an R rating.  There was HARDLY any blood or gore either.  Enough of me talking, lets get to it!To all of you who haven't seen this movie, watch the beginning closely when they're doing the interviews.  To get the ending, you have to watch closely. If you don't you will be like 'What was that all about?'The movie is not remotely that entertaining.  The movie gets lost and is boring at some parts.  The only part I did like was the ending.Also, the movie is really original.  Nothing like this has been tried and this is what gets most of the points I gave it.  If it wasn't original, I would've given like a 1/2 star or maybe even zero (only like 2 or 3 films deserve that that I've seen).Overall, if you want something original, rent Blair Witch Project.  You want some entertaining, get something else.",Null,0,1,8 February 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," This is the funniest movie of 1999-- ***1/2 out of ****
","I have been anxiously anticipating this movie since I first saw the preview. I just love the show and I thought this would just be a riot.  I was right.The movie is a musical but it's not like your Disney musical.  All the songs (or most of them) are pretty good.  Some of the songs are also offending which brings us to this topic.  The movie is very offending, no one goes untouched.  It goes from Bill Gates to black people.  They especially really make fun of gays.The animation is done really well.  The movie looks really good and is better than the show's.Overall, I highly recommend this movie.  If your a South Park fan or looking for a good (I mean great laugh) pick up South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.  You shouldn't be disappointed but be warned parents, put your kids to bed because this NEARLY escaped the NC-17 rating.",Null,0,0,2 February 2000
The Sixth Sense," An entertaining and chilling film-- ***1/2 out of ****
","This movie did very well in the box office unexpectingly.  But I must say it deserves it because it is a great film.Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a good child psycologist whom we find out because he and his wife are staring at a plaque he earned.  They go into their bedroom and find out that their house was broken into.  They find a disturbed man only in his underwear with a gun in the bathroom.  They are talking and it turns out he was an ex-patient of his.  Then the man shoots Malcolm and then he kills himself.  Then like 2 years later he goes and sees this disturbed little boy who sees dead people and the story goes on from there.There is some fine acting from Osment, the actor who played the kid who was nominated for an Oscar.  Bruce Willis also does a fine job in this film.The whole film is entertaining throughout.  The film is suspense but I wouldn't call it horror even if it does have a few 'jumpy' parts.  I really enjoyed this film and I highly recommend you rent it when it comes out in late March.",Null,0,0,12 March 2000
