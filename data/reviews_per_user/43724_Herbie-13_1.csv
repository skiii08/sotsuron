Alien 3," The finest of them all.
","Although after seeing how many comments this film already has this may be redundant. It was my favourite of all of the 'Alien' series of films. This I think can be put down to the type of film it is.Alien was a horror movie.Aliens was an action/military movie.Alien 3 was a tragedy. Unlike the first two it was concerned more with Ripley than with all the keen stuff the bug could do. It also had by far the strongest cast. Pete Postlethwaite, Paul McGann and Charles Dutton, were just a few of the amazing performances in this film.Own it.",Null,0,3,3 April 1999
