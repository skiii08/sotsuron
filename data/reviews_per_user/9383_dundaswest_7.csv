Requiem for a Dream," powerful
","Some movies are made to make money, some are made to entertain and some are made in art form with messages .Requiem For a Dream is a well made art form movie directed by Darren Aronofsky .Although it is a very powerful film with the depressive story line and great finale.Requiem for a Dream is about the four people who lose control of their lives in a short time period, divided by summer, fall and winter. This is a movie about addictions and dreams .Whether addiction to drugs, to television, to sex or chocolate all represent the same weakness of the human being .And their dreams which are destroyed by addiction.First we are introduced by summer. Summer is peaceful and joyful than the other two sections. Everything seems good for the characters .Three friends who addicted to heroin, hope that one day they can live the American dream. Harry and Tyrone in to the drug dealing to make it big and Marion, Harry's girl friend, wants to open her store. Sara Goldfarb, Harry's, mother is a television junkie and her obsession is fitting the red dress for television show, she starts a diet program and hopes lose some weights.We can not see the warm ambiance of the summer in the fall section. In fall, ambiance is getting colder and disturbing scenes create very discomfort feelings before the winter. Because of their individual addictions, everything gets worse and worse in the winter. In last part, effective and aggressive scenes are not easy to watch. Sound effect and score of the movie is primary key for the story line. Film opens with the scene of commercial television show and we hear the sound of the audience, but in same time we also hear the dark and disturbing music from the background which gives a depression of the movie in the beginning. This and the other depressive sounds, in a pessimistic way, keep the audience's attention until the closing credits. Score of the Requiem for a Dream is also getting darker in every season.Darren Aronfsky uses so many effects to make the movie more emotional. Drug using and sex scenes are very intense. Cash registers tallying in drug dealing scenes show director's great vision.Acting is almost great in the movie. Ellen Burstyn is magnificent as a Sara Goldfarb, Jennifer Connolly and Jared Leto are great and Marlon Wayens is also totally different than his other roles and he completely fits his character.Requiem for a Dream is obviously dark and very depressive movie in a lot of way. In many level, it is very discomfort film to watch. However, Darren Aronfsky manages to give us sad and confuse feeling every scene of the movie. I believe that, story, effects, acting, score and director's vision make the Requiem for a Dream one of the most impressive and effective movie ever made",9,1,2,15 February 2007
Alien," truly amazing...
","Directed by Ridley Scott in 1979.Alien perfectly combines science fiction and horror genres and has influenced many other great movies.Spaceship called NOSTROMO is returning to earth. The main computer named MOTHER receives S.O.S signal from an unknown planet. Crew is awakened by the computer and they land the planet to investigate to signal .In the planet they discover a colony of the creature and hundreds of eggs. One of the eggs hatches and attacks to crew member .Crew comes back their ship and little parasite like creature dies. Everything seems well again but there is one thing they do not know is that little parasite forms inside its host to become a greater one. In the movie we are introduced two main characters. Alien and Ripley Alien is born to survive not to kill but it kills for surviving, it is good killer and it has acid instead of the blood which is a perfect defense mechanism. moreover, alien is example of the great life formRipley, in the beginning of the movie, she seems not different than other characters but after she becomes the only person who senses that something totally wrong However, she takes care of it. Her performance is great as a leading female character which was not common in 1979.Ridley Scott uses unusual close ups to create tension and wide shots for the details of the spaceship. He also does not show the alien until the end to make the creature more mysterious and he manages to give more imagination to audience. In the movie visual effects are simple However, dark atmosphere and amazing design of the ship manage to build great tension of the movie. Entire movie was set in the spaceship. That creates claustrophobic feel to its audience. Famous chest bursting scene and secret of Ian Holmes my favorite parts in the movie. Alien has also very effective tag-line 'in space no one can hear you scream ' Alien is a masterpiece .the movie has excellent plot deep and moody atmosphere and amazing visuals. Scott uses his powerful direction style in the movie and creates one of the most famous science fiction movie ever made in the film history.",10,1,3,3 January 2007
Black Hawk Down," good action movie
","It is an action-war movie. Unlike the other war movies such as Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line or Platoon, Black Hawk Down focuses on short period of the modern war in Somalia. Instead of the essential character building sequences, movie starts with the action and never it stops. In the movie sound effects and cgi effects are outstanding. the movie has also a powerful editing style which creates very realistic and intense feel its audience. Amazing cinematography, great direction style and atmosphere are also important elements for the movie.Technically, Black Hawk Down is a good movie. Scenes perfectly manage to give realistic impression of the soldiers. But I believe that the real victims of war, civilians, more important than two or three American soldier's life. In addition, all Somali soldiers are shown as ruthless killers and the Americans are shown more humanitarian. In that point of view, Black Hawk Down loses its point as a war movie.",7,2,4,15 February 2007
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick's best
","A Clock Work Orange directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1971. The movie is great example of amazing art style cinema and Kubrick shows his visionary point of view as an artist.Movie takes place near future in Britain. Main character anti-hero Alex is a teenage gang leader. Alex and his gang members are stealing, beating and raping their victims everyday. When Alex is jailed by cops he volunteers for the experimental cure program. And he does not know that treatment is painful brainwash until it is too late. He is cured and he is ready for the new life which will be more painful than his treatment. And ironically rapist and murderer hooligan Alex become a victim of the movie In the movie, Kubrick delivers his messages in a perfect way by using symbolism in every frame. For instance, Alex kills his victim by using sculpture of the penis, He and his friends drink milk all the time and so on Amazing storytelling, strange camera angles and movements make the movie totally different than other movies. Moreover, violence is so intense and realistic that creates disturbing feel its audience. Such as, using eyeball clams, rape and beating scenes are painful to watchKubrick creates very cold atmosphere by using his camera style. And the futuristic retro designs also give a moody ambiance its audience.Political system as cruel as it can be moreover, Fascist government uses its power to control feelings. In that point, movie is asking its audience which is worst? His crime or the punishment he is given. Another great thing about the movie is its character changing. These extreme characters changing create more trouble for our victim Alex.I believe that Malcolm McDowell gives one of the most powerful performances in the history of cinema. Unfortunately, he did not get the attention which he deserved it.Soundtrack of the A Clock Work Orange is as good as it can be. Whenever I hear Beethoven or singing in the rain I picture the scenes from the movie.A Clock Work Orange is a masterpiece. In addition, Kubrick's powerful film making style proves his art vision. I came up with two questions. Is Stanley Kubrick the greatest director of all time? And, is A Clock Work Orange best Kubrick movie? I believe that he is the greatest and yes A Clock Work Orange is the best Kubrick movie.",10,1,3,15 February 2007
Blade Runner," piece of art
","Based on the novel 'do androids dream of electric sheep' Blade Runner Directed by Ridley Scott, IN 1982, despite of the its narrative ,which is typical film noir ,Blade Runner is probably the best science fiction movie ever made.Movie takes place in Los Angeles 2019.However, climate has changed extremely and all day raining make the ambiance, darker and colder which is great for a futuristic/film noir movie.Opening scene shows the pessimistic industrial new future to audience and creates depressing feeling in the beginning of the movie.The city is threatened by four human like android called Replicants. They escape from their working place (spaceship) and return to earth to find their creator. They have limited maximum four years lifetime and they are programmed with the safety software which prevents them knowledgeable about their robot beings. The company which produces replicants also invents a device contains fake personal history so they can remember their pasts.Blade Runner unit is a special group of cops who have the only power to destroy the replicants. The story of movie focuses on Blade Runner, Deckard, played by Harrison Ford. Deckard is the only cop who can terminate (retire) renegades replicants.But when he falls in love with another replicant Rachel, he starts to think about what he is doingThe movie moves very slowly as a science fiction, but it is perfect for a movie which you can also consider a film noir.However. Blade Runner is unique movie which combines two completely different genres in an excellent way.Acting is superb in the Blade Runner. Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer performances are one of the best in their career and Sean Young's performance is also fairly good and fits perfectly for her character. Visual effects are simply great in the movie. In the opening scene, big skyscrapers, disturbing fireballs, huge and cold buildings show us that future is not friendly. Flying cars and sky taxis also look pretty convincing.Score and music of the movie manage to give moody ambiance of the dark future and also using of synthesizer works well in haunting scenes.In a philosophical perspective, Blade Runner forces its audience and asks 'What makes us different than artificial' or being an artificial makes them less human. While the movie is asking these questions, we watch war between humanity and replicants.These four android and their desire to live represent that they are not just robots. They are more than artificial beings. They can feel, they can have passions and important than everything they can love. In this point movie clearly delivers its messages to audienceI believe that, the philosophical aspect, dramatic story line, dark and pessimistic ambiance and magnificent finale make the Blade runner greatest science fiction movie ever made.",10,1,2,12 January 2007
The Thin Red Line," visual art
","In the movie, there is no main character that runs whole film instead, Thin Red Line is about eight soldier and their battles, not just against to Japanese but also against to madness and war itself .The story of the movie is about the beautiful island called Guadalcanal which held by the Japanese and Americans want take it back. Private Witt played by James Caviezel, escaped from his unit and finds a peace in the paradise-like place and he is living with the natives of the island. Witt and his friend are found and send to new mission in to the island. Ambitious general played by Nick Nolte and sensitive captain who tries to protect his man for the deadly mission played by Elias Koalas Instead of the meaningless loudly action scenes, Movie focuses on character buildings, meaning of the life, madness of the war, loneliness and pureness of the Mother Nature. The Thin Red Line is not 'Americans save the civilization 'type of movie.Amazing cinematography and beautiful nature created surreal feel in every frame of the movie.The score of the movie is outstanding. Hans Zimmer made one of the best original score of all time.Special effects and make ups look so realistic and intense and create disturbing feel its audienceActing is superb in the movie, Senn Penn, Nick Nolte and Jim Caviezel gave powerful and fantastic performances however, effective voiceovers worked perfectly and give the emotion of the moment.

Gladiator," Unique
","Opening battle scene in the movie is amazing and camera movements create convincing and realistic pictures.Unique cinematograph and his stylish camera techniques also create surreal feelings in the movie and effective score gives great emotion to its audienceLighting and camera lenses manage to give warm ambiance and good atmosphere of Rome.Visual effects are great and so convincing (accept scene that tiger attacks to Maximus) Background details and costumes are all gorgeous. The Rome which he recreated in the movie is more beautiful than my imagination. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix gave powerful performances and I don't think any other actor can do better job than Joaquin Phoenix as a Commodus.However, there are some big historical mistakes in the movie. In history of the Roman Empire, Emperors never fights with the gladiators. But it is acceptable because this is a big budget Hollywood movie and it needs a powerful ending. Finally, Gladiator is good film and Scott makes another great job, stylish camera techniques, good storytelling, amazing atmosphere and visual effectiveness of colors are the proofs of his artistic vision.",8,0,0,15 February 2007
