Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for a Dream
","This movie is an emotional roller coaster with a very positive message. It portrays the miserable lives of two drug-addicts. The desperation they have just to get a fix is definitely well portrayed. Parallel with this narrative is the narrative about the one addict's mother who is basically a recluse who watches television whole day, everyday. She falls into total derangement which portrays how easily people can be brainwashed by popular media. The musical score is excellent and drenched in strong emotion.",9,4,4,22 October 2018

","Apparently this is entertainment, when in reality it is a piece of 1962 propaganda wrapped in a package that got lost in 2014. Nothing much to see here: just the usual Hollywood anti-Russian propaganda. A man's dog gets killed...and who's the baddies? The Russians, of course. This just shows me that since 1962 up to now we haven't moved forward one bit - a lot of movies are still filled with anti-Russian propaganda, but the directors never contemplate about the dark side of imperialist states like the USA and Britain. They are probably going to make a movie sometime about how the USA and Britain have never lost a war and how they are always doing everything perfect and never lost a single soldier in a battle. Go and watch this if you want to be tormented by the usual egoistic protagonist who takes out a whole bunch of Russians. A lot of people argued that the fight scenes are brilliantly done, but that doesn't compensate for the egoism and downright propaganda of the story. Lighting visuals are quite good and here and there you will find some suspenseful moments, but don't get too excited: suspenseful moments that have the potential to be constructed into psychological masterpieces are merely watered down and consumed by the apparent 'heroism' of the protagonist.",2,1,6,21 October 2018
Wind River," Wind River
","This is a crime thriller with its fundamentals rooted in the old Western style of narration. It has the typical Western style narration where the main character is portrayed as a kind of a loner who is doing his job and not bothering anybody. Then a crisis develops and the main character is directly pulled into the events and tries his best to be of assistance. The existential struggles of individuals are very well portrayed, which contributes directly to a very strong psychological component of the movie. The social issues that are typical of a deserted place like Alaska are also very well portrayed - drug abuse, murder and rape.Overall it is a cold and brutal movie that might upset people, but not in the sense that it tries to be sensational. There is no sensationalism - only a realistic portrayal of how hard life can be.",8,1,1,10 December 2018
The Exorcist," The Exorcist
","Stunning visuals, effects and overall horror for 1973. The characters are very strongly portrayed and the feeling of hopelessness is ever-present throughout the movie. Even though some scenes are outright shocking and provocative, there is also a strong element of the uncanny present. This is a very haunting movie that still shocks, amazes and intrigues after all these years.",8,10,10,21 October 2018
The Usual Suspects," The Usual Suspects
","A fun movie - in a very dark and twisted sort of way. This is more than just an action thriller; this is a brilliant movie that has all sorts of interesting dialogue. The dark humor aspect comes in where one character enters the office of a detective who starts to question him about a certain crime legend. The way the character tells the story is gripping and funny because he starts to jumble all sorts of myths, legends and free association nuances into a powerful mystery. The way the characters handle the police investigation is also quite comical, but the humor is not blatant in any way whatsoever - it is subtle and is mixed with real-life struggles and questions. In many ways this movie is the magnum opus of the crime thriller genre.",8,0,0,23 October 2018

","For many years I heard people talking about this movie, so I finally decided to see what all the hype is about, or should I rather say: the Darwin-witnesses came knocking on my door and I made the mistake of letting them in. First of all the visuals for this movie is very well done for 1968. Kubrick did a great job in that regard. But having to sit through approximately 3 hours of mankind having a fantasy about all that we are apparently achieving, is very tiring. Apparently mankind is intelligent. A monolith appears to primates in a random field somewhere after which the whole adapt-or-die theory sets in motion. Thereafter we are taken forward in time and Kubrick spends a lot of time and energy in making sure the viewer sees all the achievements of man. Liquidated food, spaceships coming in all shapes and sizes and the good old monolith randomly tumbling through the air. I have a lot of respect for Kubrick - movies like 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'Eyes Wide Shut' are brilliant, but this Darwin-witnesses odyssey is, in my humble opinion, seriously overrated.",4,1,5,21 October 2018
From Hell," From Hell
","This is so much different from the usual hack-and-slash kind of serial killer movies. This movie contains a fine balance between horror, action and suspense. Johnny Depp fits into the role of a somewhat troubled police inspector perfectly. Actually, all the actors are brilliant and the surprise-element at the end is brilliantly done.",8,1,1,20 October 2018
Identity," Identity
",This is one of those movies where a whole bunch of characters randomly come together due to strange circumstances...and then the mystery starts and deepens as the movie progresses. From the very beginning up to near the end I was wondering what is really lurking behind this mystery. Then at the end there is a nasty surprise that hits the viewer like a freight train. A thought-provoking movie that delves into the deepest recesses of the human mind and illustrates what the effects of deep buried secrets can have.,9,0,2,23 October 2018
Moon," Moon
","Let me start by saying that I expected a bit more. However, this movie has brilliant characteristics, especially concerning the factor of isolationism. The main character is somewhat confused, yet self-confident and seems to portray the general aspect of just-trying-to-survive perfectly. When the character realizes that there is something wrong, he made me feel like I had to go with him to explore the mystery. Another interesting aspect, is the relationship between a human and the AI. The relationship actually involves a lot around emotions - something that seems to be very underestimated in the real world concerning the relationship between man and AI. I expected a bit more from this movie in the sense that the director could have contributed more to the horror aspect. While the strong isolationist feeling is very well done, I expected that there would be stronger emphasis on the influence of derangement concerning individual psychological factors. Yet, a very well done movie that is recommended for fans of sci-fi drama and mystery.",7,0,1,20 October 2018
