Insidious: Chapter 2," Horror at its best!!!!
",I have always been a fan of horror movies. Slasher movies not so much usually because of the plot lack. In most cases horror movies always had the plot challenge. But Insidious chapter 2 had no problems. As a matter of fact this was one of the first ghost stories that not only scared your pants of but it also made you wanting to know what was going to happen next.I won't give up any of the story except that Amy true horror fan needs to see it. Most of the user reviews were on target with some idiotic exceptions. Now for critics that hammered this movie please find another field of work because you wouldn't know a great film if it hit you in the face.,10,7,15,14 September 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," perfect from beginning to end!!!!
",First or I don't understand what the bad reviews came from. If you are a Twilight fan then obviously you love the movie like I did. If you want white lights and you didn't like the movie you don't like vampire movies and you have no business reviewing a masterpiece such as this one.Every part of this movie was perfect from the music to the acting and the story also including a great ending to a story. To bad it had to end. Not many movies that aren't horror movies can make your heart pound in one second and the other second feel relieved. This movie played with my emotions like no other Twilight movie has done. I am NOT saying that the other Twilight movies weren't good but I do believe this one was the most emotional and is very overlooked and deserves more than what I got review wise,10,2,9,10 September 2013
The Conjuring," a future movie legend!!!!
",Its been a long time since a movie scared the pants off me without blood or guts with just using good a old fashioned storyline with great performances. Have you ever heard the expression ' they don't make them like they used to?' Well this one is made like they used to and then some.Patrick Wilson is becoming a guy who's gonna be around forever. I was impressed by his performance in Insidious and blown away with his performance in The Conjuring. I am not gonna spoil the story or go through the movie. But I will say its a must see!!! I read this only one bad review and I want to address the critic. You don't deserve to be paid for giving your idiotic opinion on this great movie. Your in the wrong business and I will never read or buy the magazine or paper that you represent. Your review was a crime and I hope you find a another line of work or maybe someone with brains sends you to the unemployment line .......,10,1,4,25 July 2013
The Purge," Sat back and enjoyed it...
",The one thing I expect from a movie is to be entertained for about 90 minutes. Now without criticizing little details and convincing myself that the movie is lying about reality or looking for flaws in the story or idea of the story I ended up liking this one. Sort of like saying Superman doesn't exist so this movie stinks. I don't think the writer or director is trying to pull a fast one in The Purge. This movie is meant to be fiction and that's how it comes off as well as keeping your interest. Job well done for the money that was spent on this film. As per the ending I've seen worse. What would your ending be? I thought it was appropriate giving you something to think about hours after the movie ends.,7,1,2,23 June 2013
