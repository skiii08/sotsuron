Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awful, awful, awful
","It amazes me that anyone, especially die-hard fans of the original films can consider this piece of festering tripe anything other than awful. Firstly, the acting - or lack of. More wood than in a furniture shop. This was not helped by the reliance on the use blue-screen technology so none of the actors get to act on a set. Secondly, that really annoying CGI character who is central to the plot - he was just irritating beyond belief. The list just goes on. The entire pod racing section plodded on for way too long and stank of an excuse to release a video game. How is it that a race that is technologically advanced enough to produce a protective shield that protects their army is unable to produce a weapon more sophisticated than a catapult?. I nearly punched myself out of sheer frustration that the day is saved by accidentally leaning on the trigger causing the laser to accidentally fire and just happen to hit the one critical part of the enemy ship causing it to blow up. Duh. But the worst part of all for me are the huge inconsistencies between it and the original films. To have Darth Vader build C3P0 is frankly ridiculous, and the notion of the Force, so beautifully portrayed as a mystical power that binds the universe together in 'The Empire Strikes Back' as being a quantifiable energy created by bacteria is soul-destroying. For me, this must rate as one of the worst and most disappointing films I have ever seen, and the only time (withe the possible exception of when I optimistically watched the 2nd film in a vain hope of Lucas redeeming himself) that I have left a cinema in a foul mood.",1,0,2,9 April 2007
