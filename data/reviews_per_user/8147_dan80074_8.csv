Casablanca," Simply the Greatest Film of all Time
","Spoilers are ahead but come on who hasn't seen this film.First off Casablanca in my eyes reigns as the greatest movie of all time with the Godfather close behind. The whole movie is a memorable scene, but since there are so many memorable ones, its hard to name them all. The battle of anthems when the drunken German Nazi officers are singing the German national anthem in Rick's cafe and then Victor gives the cue for the French National anthem and Rick approves and the club soon drowns out the Drunken German officers. This is truly one of the most memorable scenes in the movie and of all time. Also the performances in the movie are top notch. Bogie in his prime was perfect as the heartless club drunk who sticks his neck out for no one. The supporting cast in Claude Rains, Bergman, and Henrid. The movie is perfect in the sense for all of those who have had to make a hard choice in life. Rick had to make the choice between trading out Victor and keeping llsa for himself or doing the right thing and helping out his old flame and her one true love. The film is great in all aspects. The directing is also incredible. Curtiz did a great job. Overall I would recommend this movie for any movie lover.10/10",10,1,3,27 July 2008
Chinatown," Tops the Mystery Category
","This movie is in my opinion the greatest mystery film of all time and also up there in the great films of all time. Easily in the top twenty. Polanski's directing is a masterwork for all time. The movie itself is a whole joy ride. To watch it has been one of the great experiences I have ever had in watching movies. I find it a pity that it had to compete with the Godfather Part II in the same year otherwise it would have gained so much more Oscars. However, Robert Towne couldn't be denied in the best original screenplay category.As for the performances, they couldn't be any better. Jack gave an Oscar worthy performance and I'm not even sure who I would have picked between him and Al Pacino's equal performance in the second Godfather. I was a little shocked to see Art Carney take home the gold. Dunaway held her own in her respective performances.This is a true great American tragedy movie.",10,2,5,5 August 2008
Citizen Kane," Does belong in the top 5 of all time, but at #3
","My top 5 of all time:1. Casablanca 2. The Godfather 3. Citizen Kane 4. Gone With the Wind 5. Lawrence of ArabiaThis movie is great undoubtedly. I don't see it as the complete greatest of all time. I do feel Casablanca deserves the top spot. But in Orson Welles debut, this film is amazing. The screenplay is top notch. Welles delivers in acting and the directing is an example of greatness. The film shows great lessons too. The dying riddle left by Welles character which was 'rosebud' showed to be a true great lesson in values since it was on his sled when he was a poor kid. Would recommend this movie for any great movie lovers.",10,1,3,27 July 2008
Schindler's List," In the top 10 of all time
",This movie is Spielberg's best movie and that says a lot. His direction is flawless (although he was averse to direct it) as is the movie. The choice for black and white was great. Those who say its fictional and that isn't how it was and I have no idea what they are talking about. Nazis hated and killed Jews during WWII. Thats exactly what the movie shows and in the middle of it all was a man named Oscar Schindler who really did fool the Nazis by bribing them. His spent millions and saved thousands and it really happened. And Schindler knew a man named Amon Goeth who was a psycho Nazi. The men who played these guys played them as close to perfection as possible. Liam Neeson was fabulous as the man who first cared for nothing but money and his heart was changed after the horror he witnessed (but respectively lost to Tom Hanks for Philadelphia). Ralph Fiennes was great as the crazy Nazi and truly made the performance believable. This movie is probably the greatest movie of the 90s and should have reminded most people at the time that not all modern movies are sub par. The three hour and change epic goes up there with the greats.,10,9,13,5 February 2009
The Dark Knight," Very good and enjoyable but not a Masterpiece
","I saw this movie a few days after it came out because all my friends saw it and said it was great and they loved it. The hype for the movie was crazy. However, the movie wasn't an all around masterpiece. I have read some reviews saying it belongs up there with movies like Goodfellas, The Godfather, and many many other greats. Not even close in my opinion. The ending wasn't really great in my eyes with the joker not dying. I know Ledger died and he played the joker but its not like everyone on set knew he was going to die. As for the positives, I enjoyed the movie. Ledger's performance was outstanding as was the rest of the supporting cast. Eckhart, Caine, Oldman, and all others were superb in their respective supporting roles. Ledger's performance is Oscar worthy but I'm not sure I want to give the nod for this movie to receive a best picture nomination. As of right now, I would say yes but the Oscars aren't for 6 months. Many other great movies will come out that are better than this one. However, I do think the best supporting actor category is over with Ledger. He was already robbed once in Brokeback Mountain and so was the movie of best picture. The entry of the movie with the bank robbery is outstanding. The movie does deserve many Oscar nominations.RIP Heath Ledger",8,0,5,31 July 2008
It's a Wonderful Life," The most inspiring movie of all time no matter what anyone says!!
","I feel in love with this movie the first time I have ever watched it. The first time I did watch, I was having a great experience to be watching such a milestone in cinema history. This is the movie that shows you have a purpose. It shows have important one life is to all the lives around him/her. Capra was masterful in this directing and I believe this movie was better than The Best Years of Our Lives which beat it out for all major academy awards. James Stewart is also my favorite actor of all time and he was at the top of his game in this movie and one of the high points in his career. He gave a worthy best actor performance. This movie should inspire anyone who thinks they are worthless and don't have a meaning in the world. This is truly in the top 3 or 4 in my movies behind such classics as 'The Godfather' or 'Casablanca'. A true milestone in cinematic history.10 out 10 stars without a question!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,1,5,7 April 2008
The Departed," Scorsese's Best Movie Sorry Goodfellas
","Now although, I thought Goodfellas should have won best picture over Dances With Wolves (I'm not quite sure what drugs the academy takes to name that movie best picture over Goodfellas), this movie still takes the title as Scorsese's best movie in my opinion. I believe Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and The Aviator were robbed of best picture (sorry Gangs of NY but The Pianist deserved the 2002 nod for the best film of the year). This would best Scorsese as the top director of movies that won best picture with 4 over William Wyler who directed three that took the title (Mrs. Miniver 1942, The Best Years of our Lives 1946, and Ben-Hur 1959). However movies like Ordinary People, Dances With Wolves and Million Dollar Baby stole Marty's fire. I believe he is easily in the top 3 of greatest director's of all time.Now for the movie. One word- MASTERPIECE. The acting is top notch. How Leo didn't get the best actor nod and Nicholson the best supporting actor along with Mark is a mystery to me. At least the British Film Awards gave them both the nod. Supporting cast along with Jack and Mark were great including Damon, Sheen, Winstone, Baldwin and all the others make this a true acting masterpiece. I'm glad this movie finally got Marty the best director win while Raging Bull should have easily got him the award (as should have Goodfellas and The Aviator and close competition with Gangs of NY but a loss to a worthy contender in Polanski). The movie had just about everything a movie could have- comedy, drama, suspense, everything. The screenplay was magnificent as well. Bravo Marty 10/10",10,2,5,5 August 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," not nearly close to greatest of all time
","I can see why this movie is loved because it is moving and a great emotional experience, however #2 on the IMDb 250. Is this madness? It doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as the Godfather. In comparison to the Godfather lets see:1. Is it better directed than the Godfather? Not even nearly close come on this movie didn't even get a nomination while Coppola has directed a masterpiece for all time.2. Is it better Acted than the Godfather? Please Morgan Freedman vs. Brando No question and the Godfather has better supporting actors all around.3. Better Screenplay? That is a joke, Mario Puzo owns it4. Better Music? Forget about the Godfather music is famous.5. So is it all around? not a chanceAs for the movie overall, I did like it but it is good not GREAT. I found it moving and a good film for the triumph of human spirit (its not better than a flew over the cuckoo's nest either) and I found it to be a good movie. On AFI's top 100 list, it was at 72 which is a more appropriate for it. I only compared to the Godfather because the Godfather and Shawshank are in the battle for #1 when its no contest. The ending was a fairy tale too. Yeah sure people always break out of jail with a rock chipper and then move to Mexico with their pal that they met in the joint. Please.",6,0,4,27 July 2008
