The King's Speech," brilliant and superb and cinematic achievement
","this film is simply amazing - i have to admit i'm not the sort of person to watch a drama, but i had to make an exception for this film mainly because it has my new favourite actor - COLIN FIRTH.Colin firth was simply outstanding, it felt like he was actually king George the sixth. his performance was powerful, endearing and for the better part of the film, he carries it alone without a single fault. the film is funny yet it doesn't come across as comedy, but rather natural humour, which i think as a director, tom hooper had a difficult time achieving.i was throughly impressed by the cast in every way - especially Helena Bonham carter, who think is being robbed for her supporting performance, she absolutely perfect and for once i thought i didn't see a sort of red queen attitude, rather her performance was great that it morphed and fitted with Colin firth.i have nothing but good reviews for this film - i deeply recommend it anyone, mainly because it's moving, funny and just one heck of breath of fresh air.",10,2,4,21 January 2011
The Hunger Games," Stunning and effectively filmed.
","From the get go, you get the sense is film has a clear intention -- to make you think. Adaptations for me are always tricky because you can never really relay all the messages and moments that the book present and put them on the screen. The hunger games doesn't do that, but what it does, it does with effective subtlety and sublime attention.I liked how the director kept the story in Katniss's point of view. This gave the film a sense of new discovery, but also the moments where it ventures away from Katniss and explores the other parts that the book doesn't elaborate on, the book is spot on.It's certainly not the best adaptation of a book by far, but one thing i can say is that it is a really good one. The film moves from one point to the next with relative easy, but this could also be it's weakest point in that some of the moments are done too fast and we move on to the next before we have time to fully absorb some of the feelings the film presents.Gary Ross does a phenomenal job, and certainly requires high marks, but i can honestly say, 'don't expect any Oscar nominations' because for one thing the art direction was cool but very predictable, it was to reliable. The visual effects had a very hard and edge effect, but nothing we hadn't seen been done before. The acting was spot on, giving away the true and real emotions, but nothing saying Oscar because the performances didn't pop, they were just safe.All in all, the film was enjoyable and i would like to go one but that would just bore, you, so i will live you with this. Go and watch it and see it for yourself, because there are moments that will shock you, make you cry, surprise you but there are also going to be uncomfortable moments where you think the film is just reaching and losing focus, but despite that, the film has merit and recommendation and that alone should be enough reason to watch it.My score - 7.8 out of 10.",8,1,15,23 March 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," a grand start to the two part finale
","a reverting film that starts of what looks to be a grand finale.i must admit, i went into this film still reeling from the abysmal disappointment that half blood prince, a film that was filmed extremely well, but lacked in performance and plot.deathly hallows got of to any amazing start, the combination of the story and Alexandre Desplat's score was done phenomenally. the way in which they introduces Snape, was mystifying and exciting, the scene with Voldemort was grabbing, and for the first time i understood why he is 'he who must not be named'. the way in which the subtlety of the film worked was one worthy of Oscar recognition.the film was paced well, though a few editing glitches were apparent, that sometimes made miss out on certain important facts of the story. however, the director really stepped up this time around. he managed to give this story a feel of absolute fugitively, which i enjoyed to great extent. i felt like i understood the world of harry potter, something i have not felt since the fourth one.the deathly hallows moment was surprising, and i have to admit, it was done pretty, well. this was perhaps the most anticipated part of the movie, and generally had received a Lot of talk, but when it came up, i was generally surprised at how good it came across. it was clear that with deathly hallows, they knew what they wanted to do, where as in half blood prince they seemed to lack motivation and imagination on how to take it further.overall, it was an amazing experience that i surely will enjoy for a long time coming, the editing perhaps the only flaw, but they moments where the editing really stepped up, example the amazing ending. i won't say what it was, but i thought an ending to this would have left me good natured and not fussing about when the next one will come out, and i'm glad to say that's how i felt. i was annoyed at the abrupt end, rather just amazed at how they managed to leave me satisfied that i had watched a worth while film.i would throughly recommend this film for anyone who is feeling borderline about harry potter, because it will certainly revive your spirit for the boy who lived.",10,0,0,6 December 2010
Inception," why this won't win best picture
","there have been a huge number of comparisons between this film and the matrix, and if this is true, then i'm sorry to say this film won't be winning best picture or best director. true that film is good, and enjoyable, but the film can be disheartening at times, because you as an audience have to work to keep up with the movie. though i understood it, i felt cheated because i ended up explain what had just happened to my mother, who was left dazed and confused about what had just happened.the film, moved through fantastically, but the start was a bit of a giveaway, that this film will end on an annoying note. though i like what Christopher Nolan did, i was greatly disappointed that he took more time in telling the movie, than he did telling the actuals story, if you get what i mean. i can certainly see why people are quick to say this will win best picture (because the dark knight didn't) we mustn't think like that, if we are to say every physcological thriller had to win best picture because it's entertaining, then the Oscar has lost it's merit because it's supposed to celebrate films, not a specific person.",7,4,6,7 December 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," what an ending...
","i must first say that harry potter has not only spoken what goes on in the lives of witches and wizards of J.K.Rowling's world, but it has dazzled us with it's panache story line and mysterious plot that surely comes to wrap in this thrilling finale.we pick up right were we left of from part 1 of DEATHLY HALLOWS, as Voldermort takes the elder wand from Dumbledore's grave. the opening new scene,shows us that this is not a film to be taken lightly. and this is proved further by the Director's daring choice in camera-work, editing and general direction.out of all the harry potter films, this has to be the one where the entire cats, including supporting roles as well, give their all. each scene, even with no dialogue is breathtaking. the performances from Daniel, Emma and Rupert where to put it, SUPERB. not one moment did i find myself criticising their performances, because they were just that committed to making sure that this finale went off with a bang. for the first time, Rupert's comedic timing was just sport on, Daniel's panache and daring to show off harry potter was an achievement that many should be proud of, Emma pit forth Hermione in a way we have never seen Hermione before. this is all showing just how their performances were as convincing as i was when i first read harry potter and thought that this world was real. the supporting cast, Maggie smith, Matthew lewis, Ralph fiennes, Alan Rickman and so one make the most of the time they have on screen and let me tell you it is not in an way disappointing.however, the one person we must truly thank for bringing us an emotional precipice to the harry potter saga, is the director David YATES. There are just no words to describe how marvellous he directed this. each shot, each special visual effect, each movement has a purpose that serves the story and that can only be achieved if the director cares about what happening. he directs this with dignity and dare i say it, a daring sense of humour.i'm truly glad to call myself a harry potter fanatic, but for those who've yet to see or hear about potter, i urge you to go and see this movie, because trust me when i say, the movie doesn't not disappoint in giving us surprises and delivering the emotion of finishing such an iconic saga.i recommend this film to anyone who wants to be dazzled by fine film making, amazing make believe and all round phenomenal performances.",10,0,2,15 July 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," this was fantastic
","lets start of by saying, if you are one of those people who did not like this film, then don't read further, because i liked it and i thought it was huge improvement from the last.this film starts of at a high and grabbing point that makes you question that maybe this time they seemed to know what they were doing. i felt that this film was edited well in places, but in others that editing looked timid and frail, and that i think is partly because they wanted to please the fans. though i was pleased with the ravine chase in the movie, the editing was rushed at the start of the chase but It better when Victoria had gone to the other side of the border. i deeply enjoyed the way the score seemed not to add only a dark quality to the film, but the way in which the score gave it a very traditional film making feeling due to the sound of the drums and weirs clicking in the background of the score.the film was moved through fantastically and i thought, rather much better than the last one, the love dovey moments weren't over done to the moment were you feel uncomfortable like they did in new moon. this film showed that the director cared about showing the story as well as telling it, David added a cinematic edge, which has been cropping back into films since avatar.overall, the film was good, despite one or two patch performance and the let forgetfulness of the editing, i was generally pleased to see that this film was huge improvement.p.s if this proves to be true, then we will have a truly amazing two part breaking dawn, that better than eclipse....",10,1,8,9 December 2010
