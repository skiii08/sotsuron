The Blair Witch Project," What is all the hype about??
","We rented this film 2 days before Halloween.  I don't usually see scary films.  Heck, I still don't swim in the ocean and it's been over 20 years since I first saw 'Jaws'.  Both my teenaged son and myself found the film to be laughable, and certainly not up to all the hype which surrounded it. When I returned the DVD back to the rental place, I told them what I thought, and the young woman behind the counter said that was overwhelming response she had from folks returning the movie.  The idea was great, but the execution wasn't.  A big disappointment.",2,0,1,30 October 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Amazing!
","I was a little skeptical going to see a foreign language kung-fu filmwith subtitles, but 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' was a mostamazing movie.  From the opening minutes of the film, I wascaptivated by the acting, the scenery, and yes, the kung-fu fightscenes.  The story flowed smoothly, the characters werefull-bodied people who I could really care about, and the fightscenes were breathtaking!  This is definitely a must-see.",10,0,0,29 December 2000
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better than the first one
","Marvelously inventive, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' follows Harry, Hermione, and Ron through their second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraftand Wizardry.  The trio has grown up over the summer holiday.  Ron has gotten taller, Hermione has started to lose her baby fat, and Draco Malfoy seems more menacing than ever, with a larger countenance and slightly deeper voice. 
Readers of the books will remember 'TCOS' is a more serious that 'TheSorcerer's Stone', which introduced us to the Hogwarts family.  The story isn't as lighthearted as the first film, which set the tone for the series, It's darker and scarier, with a villain who is unseen for most of the movie, but revealed in a frightening sequence in the Chamber of Secrets.Jason Isaacs, who played the evil Col. Tavington in 'The Patriot', is creepy as Lucius Malfoy, proving the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  Kenneth Branagh is perfectly pompous as Gilderoy Lockhart, and if you stay through the entire credits, you will be treated to a final scene of him.TCOS is a terrific second film in the series that makes you wish there wasn't going to be 2 years until the next one rather than one.",8,0,0,21 November 2002
