Resident Evil: Afterlife," Well worth the entrance fee...
","Gets the series back on track after what I thought was a disappointing 3rd instalment.The action scenes are fantastic, especially in the 3D mode. The characters have some real substance to them and we start to see more creatures from the games.It seemed to me that this film, even taking into consideration as good as it is, takes a different direction to the first 3 and is simply a prelude to what looks like a magnificent 5th instalment judging by its ending.Just go see it!",8,8,18,11 September 2010
