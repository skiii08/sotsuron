The Avengers," Not worth the hype
","I think Disney must have hired a couple of hundred people to fill up the internet with glowing reviews because this movie is not worth all the online 'AWESOME-BEST MOVIE EVER' quotes I'm seeing everywhere. When I give it 5 out of 10 I think I'm being generous. I was bored and disinterested at least at 2 or 3 different times in the movie. So... waste your money if you want at the theater, but I suggest you wait to see it at home. At least you'll have a couch to fall asleep on to get through the middle part. Even the actors seemed disinterested. Captain America had no passion. The King Loki character was awful. Mottling, feeling sorry for himself, no fight, I mean come on! he's supposed to be a King. Bruce Banner was flat flat flat. At least when he turned into the Hulk he had some passion.",5,6,20,28 May 2012
