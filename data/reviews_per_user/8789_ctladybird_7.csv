Casablanca," I can finally say I saw this movie!
","Given the odds that this film could become a classic at all, I am pleased to say I can see why. This movie, back in the time of a stricter code of movie ethics, is a passionate testament to old love and the bittersweet feelings of letting go. Set in Morocco, this film has a beautiful sense of composition and lighting, setting the stage for films to come. The characters are rich, and while not all of them are complex they are still a treat and do not feel trope-y. Humphrey Bogart shines in this serious role, instead of the comedy roles I have seen him in. Ingrid is simply amazing in her role as the lover to ruined Rick for other women. The story itself is heartbreaking and beautiful. I was left in tears in the end.",10,1,2,30 March 2014
Taxi Driver," I finally know where 'Are you talking' to me' comes from
","I had no idea what I was in for when I started watching this film. A movie that seems part 'The Professional' and part Noir, I was taken aback at how young Robert DeNiro was. The story itself is a good one: Man without a purpose finds it in the need to rescue an innocent. The innocent this time is a young Jodie Foster, who plays a child prostitute who just wants to go home to her family. The soundtrack is very 'New York City' and adds to the overall tone of the film, and DeNiro shines in this role. The gore in the final shoot out is downplayed by the red lights of the final scene, forcing you to focus more on the action and intent. In all I was blown away by this fantastic piece of cinema.",10,0,0,6 May 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," A stunning tribute to the Great Depression
","A film that uses interesting composition and framing, silhouettes, and outstanding performances by its actors has earned a place among the classics. From the start we are given a taste of foreshadowing. The 'no Riders allowed' sticker on the truck, the out of work preacher. That is a taste of what this family is in for. Further foreshadowing includes the son coming back from prison for homicide. I first decided to watch this film because of the Mumford and sons song 'Dust Bowl Dance' that is a homage to the book, which I would also like to read. Fantastic movie with a great cast and haunting history. I really cannot get over the quality of this film.",8,0,1,31 March 2014
The Graduate," A jarring film about the uncertainty of the future
","I would first like to point out the massive contrast between films like this and modern 'Coming of age' films. Ben's behavior towards Elaine (Which is far from romantic) is never condoned by ANYONE in the film, even his own parents. When Elaine screams the rest of the men in Ben's house come to make sure she is okay and refuse to leave until she is okay. In today's coming of age films Ben would be encouraged and goaded and told his behavior was okay, and the ending would have implied a happy ending for the two. 'The Graduate' is a jarring film about falling into toxic relationships and the life of a jaded youth. If Ben had just gone to work or chosen a graduate school, or perhaps worked harder to refuse Mrs. Robinson's advances, would his situation have been better off? With fantastic film work and amazing cinematography, 'The Graduate' asks the important questions.",10,0,0,27 April 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Best Musical I have seen in a long time
","Catchy songs, beautiful choreography, and a great cast to boot, Singin' in the Rain is by far a gem of it's time. Gene Kelly kills as Don and his teeth are so white! The romance in the film feels natural and real, and gives me plenty of warm-fuzzy feelings. Jean Hagen shines as a would-be antagonist, hilarious and beautiful and infuriating all at once. Together they form a colorful cast of characters, made for the big screen. The Technicolor of the film is stunning and brilliant. Despite some plot loopholes (Couldn't Lina still sue at the end?) I still thoroughly enjoyed this production. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of musical films.",10,0,2,3 April 2014
Pulp Fiction," Do not fall asleep during this movie! You will miss a lot!
","I fell asleep the first time I saw this film (It was 3am when we started watching) and I woke up confused as hell. However this film is one of Tarantino's best. A sort-of prequel to 'Reservoir Dogs' This film is one of pop culture's immortal beings in the world of film. The setup of the film reminds me a lot of Guy Ritchie, and perhaps the two directors were influenced by the other. An awesome action packed bloodbath that is Tarantino's trademark, Pulp fiction is a must-see for any movie buff. This is the film that launched Uma Thurman to stardom, and the only film where you will see Bruce Willis fight a gimp. You cannot go wrong with this movie at all in the slightest.",10,0,2,8 May 2014
The Wizard of Oz," An old Favorite
","As a film based on a book it is very inaccurate. As a film that is an escape from the bleak greys of real life, the Wizard of Oz shines. It is both a coming of age story about responsibility and being true to oneself and a whimsical adventure. Utilizing the use of Technicolor in contrast to black and white, we see Dorothy come into her own in the world of Oz, a place where trees are offended if you take their fruit, and anything can happen. In the end Dorothy learns that she always had the ability to get home, but had to learn and grow from her adventure to reach that point. When she returns home she is reunited with her family. Sadly Toto's fate probably remains unchanged.",7,3,5,14 March 2014
