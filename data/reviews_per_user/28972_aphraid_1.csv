The Devil's Advocate," Very good flick.
","Very well acted, casted and plotted film. Great storyline, although at the end it may seem slightly 'unfulfilled' with absence of Religious knowledge, but albeit a very good movie. This movie is very creative, intelligent and intriguing, keeps you watching until the end. One of Keanu Reeves' roles which are not comic at all and shows his versatility as an actor. Al Pacino shows a wonderful role as his common charactery... Shouting, anger, intelligence and blatant disregard for conforming to proper standards, with slight comedic genius.All in all, A well made movie, definitely worth a watch, even for the religiously devoid.",9,1,1,5 September 2006
