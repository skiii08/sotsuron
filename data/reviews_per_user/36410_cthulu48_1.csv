Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Christian overtones spoiled the film for me. I'm only writing minor spoilers in this review.
","NOT MANY SPOILERS HERE.Whenever a film delves 3 sequels deep and adds a new director and shuffles the cast around with key players missing, things just aren't going to be the same. The film tries its best, but there are a couple elements of the plot that pretty much spoiled the film for me upon my first viewing.I guess I'm going to ruffle some feathers with my main beef with this film: The perfect, can-do-no-wrong, always forgiving and merciful hero character of Philip the Clergyman. I realize this is a Disney movie, and morals play a big part in all of the company's films. However, I found the Christian character Philip the Clergyman to be over the top in his perfection as a moral crusader. Without going into too much detail, every character in the film is a complete scoundrel with the exception of Philip. Every statement or action taken from this character blatantly rubs your face in Christianity as infallible and the saving grace of every aspect of the ugliness of the pirates. It got to the point of being sickening when the mermaid was captured in order to use her tears to obtain use of the Fountain Of Youth. The ONLY character who has any problem with the way the mermaid slave is treated is Philip. He is her savior, so to speak (and literally), throughout the film, even though she tried to take him out earlier in the film (the forgiveness factor, of course.) He takes mercy on her and defies ALL the surrounding pirates in their quest to use the mermaid. I agree with the morals of Christianity for the most part, while I don't believe in the supernatural aspects of the faith. What I don't like is that the Christian element of the film is not handled subtly AT ALL. It's in-your-face, every time the character crosses the screen or speaks. We are introduced to the character as he is hoisted and tied up on the boat against his will (hmm... sounds familiar to a certain crucifixion to me), and then proceeds to defy and challenge all the pirates, including Blackbeard (who's supposed to be the most ruthless pirate on the sea), with no reprisals. The overall message: If you aren't Christian in this film, you're a scoundrel. Personally, I found it poorly executed and unnecessary. No need for religious overtones in this film.Another small problem I had with the plot: When the crew meets with Captain Jack Sparrow to discuss Blackbeard (before we are introduced to him in the film), every crew member says that they've never seen him (or have hardly ever seen him) because he never comes out of his room. Shortly thereafter, Blackbeard emerges as chaos envelopes the ship (which is fine, since there was a 'mutiny' going on at the time), but then he spends the rest of the film out of his room and alongside all the other pirates, quite contrary to the discussion that is being held by Jack Sparrow and the crew of Blackbeard's ship when we are told that Blackbeard is hardly ever seen. I think if we saw less of Blackbeard in this film, the character would've been more powerful and it would've made the pirate meeting make sense. I just kept thinking throughout the film, 'I thought he never comes out, what gives? He's everywhere!' If you are a 'Pirates' fan, give the film a chance. The action is ever-present and well executed. Johnny Depp is on point again (although he is becoming a bit of a stunt-actor in these films as more and more sequels emerge), and although I personally cannot stand Penelope Cruz, I will give credit where credit is due. She has a good performance and has great chemistry with Depp. Blackbeard isn't as dastardly as I was hoping. This is a bit of a disappointment since he's supposed to be the most feared pirate on the sea. Geoffrey Rush is good in his role-reversal this time around, although I enjoyed his character much more when he was a straight-up pirate. And a small appearance by Keith Richards is great. My main problem with the film is a personal beef (the overt Christian message), which may not have any effect on your enjoyment of the film. For fans, it's worth a view for sure, but there are some disappointing elements. I'd call it the 'worst' installment in the series, but that doesn't make it unbearable. In fact, it's a fun movie going experience. That's about as deep as it goes for me though, since I'm not digging the Christian stuff. Judge for yourself, but if you're Christian, it would be better not to judge the people who made the film if you don't like it. I here tell that there are severe punishments in your religion if you are judgmental towards people.5 out of 10.",7,0,2,30 May 2011
