",What a snooze fest! Was like watching paint dry it'll be 2 hours of your life you'll never get back! I love syfy movies for the most part so I'll put this movie up there with getting a root canal don't waste your time on this movie and stick with the first one it was actually good unlike this one!,1,4,9,30 June 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," I only have one complaint!
","OK, let me start by saying this was a good movie. The only thing I didn't like was the ending I really wanted to know how the trip was going end. I know that was the point of the ending it had but dang I wanted to know what was going to happen next! From the beginning to the end it keeps pulling you in to the story of who done it with a lot of good and not overly done comic relief to keep you interested. You want to know who the killer is so bad which is why I highly recommend this movie as a must see.",10,0,1,17 August 2018
