Vertigo," Not one of my favorite's
",I tried to like this movie but.. I can't. It just horrible. I'd have to say the worst of Hitchcock's films. I love Jimmy Stewart but I just couldn't get into this one. People tell me that I have to watch it a couple times to really 'get' it but I don't know how I could sit through it another time without getting a migrane. Anyway if you're thinking of renting this one.. DON'T!,Null,2,6,4 October 1999
Casablanca," Didnt like it
","The only reason I saw this movie was because everyone told me how wonderful it was. When I finally got through it, I didnt see what the big deal was. Now don't get me wrong, Bogart and Bergman are wonderful actors, but I just didnt like this one. I don't know why it's considered a classic. Maybe just because it's the most quoted movie in history, who knows. Anyway, I thought Bogart was better in The African Queen.",Null,0,2,6 October 1999
The Big Lebowski," Very Funny!
","I wasn't sure if I'd like this film or not. I really wasn't going to give it a chance but came across it one day and was pleasantly surprised! I thought it was very funny and Jeff Bridges was just great as Dude! That's all you heard throughout the film, it was so funny! If you feel like having a good laugh, than this film is for you!",Null,0,0,17 October 2000
12 Monkeys," A waste of time
","This is the worst movie I've ever seen! When I finally got through this movie I had the worst migrane in the world! Now I like Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt but.. what were they thinking with this one?? What a horrible film. If you havent seen this movie yet, count your blessings!!",1,15,68,4 October 1999
The Mummy," It was alright
",It wasnt the best movie but it was good. Good performances by Brendan Frasier and the rest of the cast. I liked the scene when the face came out of the sand. Like I said it was good but I know it could have been a lot better. Well I guess we'll see how the sequel is.,Null,0,0,6 October 1999
Singin' in the Rain," Best musical ever made
","This is one of the best films ever made! Just about every musical number is wonderful. Personally, I think the best one (other then the title song) is 'Moses' performed by Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor. Also 'Make 'em Laugh' performed by O'Connor is great. I can't picture anyone else playing Cosmo. It's ashame Gene didnt win anything for his performance in this. It was just amazing. Everything was amazing! I'm glad to see that the AFI ranked it at #10! If you don't have anything to do on a Sunday, go rent this movie, believe me, you wont regret it!",10,1,4,22 December 1999
Titanic," One of the best movies ever!
","This is a great movie no matter what anyone says. The storyline, actors.. everything is just wonderful. I personally think that Gloria Stuart should have gotten the oscar for her portrayal as 'old Rose'. She did a wonderful job as did Kate Winslet, Leo DiCaprio and Billy Zane. This is one movie that I will never get tired of!",Null,0,2,4 October 1999
To Kill a Mockingbird," I love this film!
",This is a great film! Gregory Peck is amazing as Atticus Finch! Now I understand why this is his favorite movie he's done. He definately deserved the oscar! I was also impressed with Mary Badham as 'Scout' and Phillip Alford as Jem. They were great considering how young they were! A wonderful movie that anyone would enjoy! I give it a 10/10!,Null,0,1,19 October 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Why wasnt Robbins up for an Oscar??
","This is a wonderful movie, thanks to Tim Robbins. His role as Andy Dufresne is just amazing! I usually don't watch prison films but this one just pulls you in and doesnt let go until the end. Morgan Freeman is very good in this but I still think it was Robbins that clinched it as a top rated movie. I can't believe horror writer Stephen King came up with the story for this. What an amazing man! Now I see why they had to slip Rita Hayworth into the movie. I wonder how she'd respond to Morgan's little comment about her when they were watching 'Gilda'? :-) If you havent seen this film, please do ASAP.. it's worth it!",Null,0,0,4 October 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the best movies to date!
","This was such a good movie! Jodie Foster did a wonderful job as Clarice Starling and Anthony Hopkins.. wow! I don't think anyone else could have played Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter like he did. Great casting, great acting, great everything! This is a must see! If you haven't seen this, go rent it NOW!",Null,0,0,7 March 1999
The Sixth Sense," It was good but not the best
","On my way to the theatre to see this film I was expecting a really, really scary film. I was frightened about one time during the whole movie. Now I'm not saying this movie was bad, because it wasnt. It just wasnt what I expected. I do have to admit it does have a really good ending. That's the best part of the film. The only problem is you have to sit through almost 2 hours to see the one really good part of the film.",Null,0,0,4 October 1999
The Breakfast Club," Best of the 'Brat Pack' movies
",This is one of the best movies of the 80's if you ask me. These actors work so well together and we can all relate to this movie because of them. (Depending on age) This is the best movie of the 'Brat Pack' with St. Elmo's Fire coming in the close 2nd!,Null,0,1,7 March 1999
Jurassic Park," Good movie
",I liked this movie. This is one of Spielberg's best. I love the scene when the T-Rex first gets out and the kids are in the car... oh man when that mouth comes down on the glass roof.. whew! Good performances by everyone in this. The sequel to this was horrible but this one was great!,Null,1,2,6 October 1999
