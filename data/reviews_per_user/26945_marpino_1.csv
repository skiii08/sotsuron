Casablanca," Casablanca: the best
","I think I've seen this film about eight times. And every time there's something new: a gesture, a detail, a remark. Of course the statements of Rick are... 'awful' but... so special. 'This morning dear? That's so long ago I don't remember'. And how romantic is Ingrid Bergman's remark in Paris: 'Are those the bombs or is it my heart beating?'. I believe the feelings of a woman in love are so wonderfully said in one sentence. Repeating all those statements will be boring here. The high voters will know them all. Amazing fact that this film is made in 1942...and now (end 2005) after watching 50, 75 of 100 films 'Casablanca' still is my favorite's!",10,1,2,14 October 2005
