Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hey, this was a GOOD movie!
","First of all, PLEASE stop with the Jar Jar bashing. Sure, he was annoying in a few scenes. I could have foreseen some of his slapstick before I even bought my ticket. Still, I really liked him. Nobody's perfect. I thought the plot was great. So were the special effects. My two favorite parts were the most graphic intense ones in the movie. The pod race scene blew me away!! I sit in the second or third row when I see the movie just to get immersed in that one scene. Also, the last part of the movie, which included those fight scenes and that stunning Gungan parade, was a hit with me. I don't see how anyone could say this movie was lacking in anything. This is on my top ten list, to be sure. Although, to be honest, I have seen better flicks. It gets better every time I see it!",10,5,7,3 June 1999
