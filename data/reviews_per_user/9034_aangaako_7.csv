Sucker Punch," A misjudged movie.
","A movie criticized for being too noisy, sexist, hurts the sentiments of feminists & style over substances, Sucker Punch deals with the inner trauma faced by a group of girls & their journey to get their freedom rather in a unique way by approaching the reality through their own fantasies.
Misjudged, misunderstood and Backlashed by many critics and audiences alike, now loved by those same people who considered it as 'not worthy of a penny'.
I misjudged it too but after viewing several times I loved it even more and one more thing - 'THIS MOVIE WILL BE A CLASSIC SOME DAY!'PS - Watch the 'extended version' for best viewing!",8,5,9,3 September 2018
Interstellar," Gripping, Check; Great Performances, Check; Too long, Hell No!
","It's my 5th viewing and when did the 169 mins flew I don't know, my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. Yeah, the score was a repetitive but couldn't agree more with the fact that it was emotionally packed, Hans Zimmer knows what he's doing? Sometimes it feels like the melodrama between Cooper and his daughter ruining the impactful theme of the film but again it was for the emotional connection between those two individuals.Good:- Chris Nolan's Direction, The Nolan brother's tight screenplay, Hoytema's brilliant cinematography, Zimmer's powerful score, Gorgeous visual effects (I like it more than Gravity coz it didn't show us more, it shows less and the rest is left to us to imagine), Great Production Design, somewhat a loud sound effects (due to which some of the dialogue inaudible) but nonetheless it was pretty damn great and The cast's powerful performances specially Mackenzie Foy (as Young Murphy),is a one young talent I don't want to miss.Bad:- The only (and main) reason why the whole concept of the movie didn't suit because of the blight situation. Even with a voracious blight it would take million of years to reduce the Earth's oxygen from it's atmosphere.That's why I give it a 9/10, the only bad reason is also a big enough. So, overall I frickin loved it, hope to see this film again. Just wait for 20 years and it'll be a definite Sci-fi Classic, I mean it'll be a cult classic in those 20 years for sure. (well, it's still a classic though! ;-))",9,2,3,11 March 2019
Little Miss Sunshine," Best 'Road Movie' for me, Period.
","Nothing to say anything, it's a FRICKIN BRILLIANT PICTURE, that's it!
(Yeah, some minor plot holes or else it'll get 10)",9,2,2,24 October 2018
A Quiet Place," Krasinski & team delivered a top notched monster thriller but with many 'logical' plot holes.
","The movie was breathtaking for sure. Sound effects, Score, Performances, almost everything is fine but as many of the reviewers said-
1. They should have live at the river if the river's sound make them able to speak freely.
2. Corn plantation without making any noises?
3. Blunt is Pregnant at the time of monsters epidemic?
4. Krasinski can divert that creature by making a loud sound with his axe.
5. The opening death was girl's fault.
6. They have CCTV camera system but unable to provide a single soundproof room?
7. Blunt should have REMOVED THAT BLOODY NAIL after she hurts herself!
8. Blunt easily killed the monster by a shotgun but in the newspaper bulletin it shows that military armies were defeated by them (& armies have lots of guns & tanks)Ofcourse We're Human, we can see lots of plot holes even in a great film but nonetheless this film deserves to be praised.
After a long long time I was thrilled by a monster movie, I was glued to my phone the entire 90 minutes.A sequel is green lited but I'll be more excited to see this film story as a web series, from origin to it's end.8/10",8,0,0,14 August 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," The Movie that changed almost everything.
","' The Movie' that gained much recognization in the late 90s (& still rocking in everyone's favorite movie list) changed everything. I mean, it literally changed almost everyone's prespectives regarding life.
Nothing to say about Direction & other relatable things (bc there's nothing to say about it, everything was pitch perfect.)
Many filmgoers compared Andrew's story to Messiah (Jesus) changing everyone's life (directly or indirectly that matters to that person) & yeah, they're not wrong. They also said that the movie is actually about Red's belief about friendship, truth about life, dignity, joy, etc.
Oh man, I might need more space to write about this movie bc there's so much to say but I don't know how to explain it! Actually, this movie is to experience it & relate to your life. Free from whatever you thought that blocking you to live YOUR life fullest.
Best FRICKIN movie ever, Period.
PS - There's still some imperfections about this film but please while watching this just focus on the story & it's depth, not it's faulty things.",10,0,0,17 September 2018
Black Panther," Ryan Coogler's Direction, Michael B. Jordan's and Andy Serkis's Performances save this 'not so' best superhero Movie
","Short Review -
I personally liked it after watching thrice. The simple plot & the emotional factors were good but after seeing Rotten Tomatoes giving 98% and Metacritic giving 88 I was unflattered. Yeah it's a good movie but no near The Dark Knight.
Visuals sucks (comparing it's budget) & so many plot holes.
It's a good movie but not the best superhero movie.",7,0,1,13 August 2018
Annihilation," Mr. Garland, You did it again!
","Unlikehis debut venture, Annihilation is not everyone's cup of coffee. It's an adventure but with so many possibilities, which is either way ends with confusion and This movie exactly did that. For it's complicated structure the movie tanked at the box office but who cares! Garland and his team delivered one of the best movie of this year.
Direction, Performances, Cinematography, Score, Sound Design, Production Design, Visuals, every goddamn thing was perfect & special credit to Sonoya Mizuno for her terrifying motion capture performance as an Humanoid.
It was worth my time & who loves Andrei Tarkvosky's Solaris and his other features, I guaranteed you'll not disappoint.",8,0,2,13 August 2018
