Conquest 1453," Conquest of green screen
","I watched this movie with the best intentions and ignoring any historical inaccuracies. The CGI was average to bad, the panoramic scenes of Constantinople looked like it was build in Second Life. The SGI was created from Epics Fx Studios and prior to 'Fetih 1453' they've done some work for another Turkish film 'Ã‡anakkale 1915' and some obscure no budged documentaries. Most of the movie was filmed against a chroma-key background but without great results, the master shots are OK but the layering was bad. The fighting (green) scenes are simply boring and even the use of gore didn't save them. Of course in the film only the Roman soldiers are dying while the Ottomans are undefeated ninjas. The script seems bold and boring and it makes no difference if they talked or laughed. The good parts of the film are the acting and the costumes. Good work from the young and inexperienced actors Dilek Serbest, Ibrahim Celikkol and Devrim Evin.Turkish cinema has lot to offer some great films are: Uzak, once upon a time in Anatolia, Three Monkeys, soul kitchen, The Edge of Heaven.So how did the spend the $18.2 million budged?",4,9,13,4 December 2013
