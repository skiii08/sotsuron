Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Its cool in a whole different way to Part 1 - but why split?
","Lets be honest, Kill Bill should not have been split into two separate movies. It's plainly obvious from the start that the piece was meant to be whole and therefore we the movie going public were forced into a 6 month intermission between films. Call me cynical but the fact that this movie came out 5 days after the DVD release of part 1 just smacks of a blatant attempt to rake in more cash from the consumer. That said I really enjoyed the movie, in a different way to part 1. The dialogue is more prolonged here, there are no massive fight sequences and no manga cartoons that cry out 'Hey, look at me, I'm QT and I've done something no other director has - worship my coolness!'. Taking away my cynical streak the movie was very enjoyable. I enjoyed the fleshing out of the characters and the anticipation of how each one would meet their end. The fact that I revisited Part 1 just before helped me to get straight into the plot(another reason I am annoyed at the split) and there are plenty of clever, funny and striking scenes to make even the most cynical movie-goer appreciate Tarantino at his best. Every one of the main cast are on top form, and Carradine's Bill dominates every scene in which he appears, including his ending, which unfortunately did come across as a little far fetched. But that is one of the main appeals in these movies. They are set in an unreal world where people can kill at will and not get arrested. And where humans can act like superheroes and still have very human emotions. Tarantino drags you into his world, grabs your interest, and makes you believe what he is doing is cool - and fun. I appreciated this movie as a very entertaining work, and to that end I can just about forgive the self indulgent splitting of the two movies.HIghlights for me were Daryl Hannah reading to Budd about snake venom, and Uma's training with her master, Pai Mei. The guy was just great - I love the way he screamed at her and how he was prone to stroking his beard! All in all this movie is great, and I would just prefer it to Part 1, merely because I like the characterisation. But to be honest both parts should be viewed as one movie, as I am sure they were originally intended.",9,1,2,24 April 2004
Spider-Man 2," A fabulous movie, true to the spirit of the comics
","Watching Spider-man 2 was a true joy. It concentrates on action and characterisation in equal measure and is all the better for it. Lets face it - the Spider-man story is the best in all comicdom so you know they have great material to work from. The characters are joyful and the story itself is unique - this is not an all powerful superhero. He has plenty of problems - in essence he is just a poor kid trying to do his best. There is something in the character we can all relate to. That said, it would have been easy to play it safe with this movie, and just overload it with mindless violence and unbelievable subplots. Director Sam Raimi avoids these pitfalls by giving us a hero we can believe in. His weaknesses underline his true strength. All the leads play their roles well, and bring the fabulous comic book characters to life with ease. I only wish this could have been developed into a series because the only problem with a movie is that it has to cover so much ground in a short space of time. These characters develop quickly, but the movie is paced well and you find yourself happily coming along for the ride. One of the best scenes involved Peter Parker rescuing a kid from a fire and then realising that he could not save another from dying. Therein lies one of the key messages in this story - nobody can save everyone. The closing scene with Peter and Mary Jane really epitomises his selflessness and Mary Jane's strength of character. She is not just there as eye candy and you really feel she can be a real partner in future plots. Overall I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone, comfortably the best superhero film ever made. Lets just hope they continue to maintain films of this high standard.",9,0,0,20 August 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Thought provoking, entertaining, and not too demanding.
","This film will not appeal to the masses but it still serves a purpose. In my case it made me think about the possibilities in life, that hinge upon certain times that could change in an instant how we live. It is well acted, and completely preposterous, and I found myself entertained. The ending was not what I expected and the film is all the better for not being totally predictable. Ashton Kutcher proves that he can hold a storyline convincingly but I felt that Amy Smart, as the doomed/happy/doomed/happy love interest stole the honours for impact. She had a way of looking totally downbeat in one scene and stunning in the next. I really cared what happened to her character. The film pulls no punches, and some of the scenes are very dark, but I was glad they were not watered down, as this really added to the human interest of the storyline. Recommended as a good way of killing a couple of hours, but don't expect to be adding it to your top 100.",7,0,1,20 April 2004
