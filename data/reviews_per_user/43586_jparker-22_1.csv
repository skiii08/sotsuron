Walk the Line," I wanted to walk back into the theater and see it AGAIN!
","I went into 'Walk the Line' with hesitation. When I heard that Phoenix and Witherspoon would be singing I did not like the idea. I wanted to hear Johnny Cash and June. I did! As the movie picked up I actually thought Johnny Cash was still alive and on the screen. I was especially impressed with some of Phoenix's body movement. He seemed to really learned the way Johnny Cash walked, played guitar and sang slightly from the side of his mouth. The 'addiction' part of the movie seemed to drag a bit, but the supporting characters were so developed that it carried. Obviously the music was fantastic. Oscars for everyone in 'Walk the Line.'",8,5,11,19 November 2005
