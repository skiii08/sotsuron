It," Good movie, but not really horrific
","I was absolutely sure that this movie would terrify me, but it does not contain as much horror as one might expect. It contains a lot of humor and the scenes of pure horror are mostly short, which makes the movie feel like an emotional roller-coaster. This might be appealing to some people but I personally prefer the movies that mercilessly hold on to the horror, barely letting go even for a single comic relief.I enjoyed the movie as a whole, but as I expected to be scared I was disappointed anyway. The CGI looks ridiculous at some points and the funny parts are actually better than the scary parts. I could recommend this movie, but not to anyone who wants to watch a scary horror movie.",5,5,11,15 September 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Visually appealing, that's it!
","I feel very generous for giving this movie 4/10 as the visual effects is the only good thing about it. The plot feels like the previous movies over again but watered down and the countless desperate attempts to make jokes are based on either sexism or strained stupidity. The few times the jokes are actually funny they are elongated or repeated to the point were they just get annoying.Though, if one would cut this movie down to 15 minutes of sailing ships and naval battles it would be quite entertaining.",4,1,4,11 June 2017
