Deepwater Horizon," Intense and moving
","Deepwater Horizon is based on true events- the explosion of an oil rig in 2010, which created the worst oil spill in US history. The first act of the film is rather character driven and explores the life of Mark Williams, played by Mark Wahlberg. He does a great job in the role and as usual puts in a great performance. Other actors include John Malkovich and Kurt Russell who also do well with the solid script, which relies largely on banter in the opening part, and the film can be funny despite the sensitive topic. As the film continues, you know what's coming and the way tension is built though mechanical shots of the inner workings of the rig are clever, as this builds the tension.The actual explosion is the rig is incredibly intense, and the film is gripping all the way through. Even though most know the story, Deepwater Horizon never lost my interest and this is credit to the director Peter Berg, who showed his action style with the also gripping Lone Survivor. The action was largely not done through CGI and therefore looks very realistic and this is crucial for a personal film such as this. The aftermath and closing section of the film is very moving- after the high tension of the explosion, the personal tragedy caused by the event comes to the fore here and makes for a terrific ending and tribute to those who lost there lives. The soundtrack is touching here, and this is no surprise with the excellent Steve Jabolonsky on scoring duties.The film's only fault is there is little development of most characters and they rather get lost behind the weight of the story, apart in this case from Wahlberg's character. Overall, Deepwater Horizon is a intense and moving tribute to those who lost their lives in this tragic event, and it's personal touch is clear which makes for an excellent film.",9,0,1,9 October 2016
American Sniper," A absolute must see
","When you go and watch a Clint Eastwood film, you expect a powerful film filled with emotion and heart stopping tension. American Sniper doesn't disappoint in these departments, as Eastwood delivers a stunning motion picture.Firstly, Bradley Cooper is fantastic as Chris Kyle, delivering typical family man values but losing them thorough the pressures of war. he delivers emotion and passion in the role, and was the perfect casting choice. Sienna Miller is great as his wife too, showing the stress of being a wife to a Navy Seal.Another big positive is, of course, the action. It's very realistic, with plenty of blood and exciting moments to keep American Sniper moving at a good pace. Also, the script is brilliant as the dialogue between Kyle's army mates is snappy and often comedic, again very realistic.To top this cracking film off, the ending scene where Kyle is revealed to have died is very powerful and wraps up a powerful film perfectly.Overall, a total triumph.",10,14,32,26 January 2015
Ant-Man," Impressive.
","I love pretty much all the Marvel films, except Iron Man 2, which is awful. They often involve big action set pieces, but Ant-Man is a little different. The action is toned down, and the film is much more character driven, and the movie reaps rewards from this. The characters are brilliantly written and they spark off each other and create chemistry between themselves. This is achieved by a fantastic and quirky script, which Ant-Man benefits from.Michael Douglas is puts in a solid performance along with Paul Rudd and all the other cast. The acting is very solid throughout the film, and Michael Pena's character is a brilliant and well-written part to the film. Ant-Man has moments of brilliant comedy, which mean the film's 2 hour run time just fly by, the film feels effortless in it's cleverness. Now, to the action scenes. They are few, but when they do come, they are eccentric and feel different in the way they are shot/edited from other films. When Ant-Men shrinks, the difference in scale feels real and this is vital to the film's success and is what provides the action with a different feel.The problem I had with Ant-Man was it lacked a killer punch in the finale. Even though the final act is good, I feel it lacked a moment to make you go 'WOW!!', and you usually get these moments in Marvel films. I also felt that some strands of the storyline were not followed up on in the film's conclusion, but maybe they will be addressed in later Ant-Man films, as I presume there will be a sequel.Overall, Ant-Man is a great addition to the Marvel cinematic universe, and it's eccentric and has a lot to enjoy. It's got it's niggles, but it's great fun and Ant-Man will be a brilliant edition to future Avengers films.",8,0,6,18 July 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Perfection in movie form
","I wrote a glowing review on here for Age of Ultron, and I watched it again recently and it wasn't as good as I remember. So I wanted Civil War to be better, and it's better in every single aspect, from the plotting to the action scenes. The plot is that collateral damage from an event divides the Avengers, and it ends with civil war. That is a very broad summary but I don't want to spoil it. The plot is considered, well planned and intriguing with many elements pulling together to make a thrilling plot with surprises along the way. Unlike Avengers 2, the story isn't messy and it's more interesting as it doesn't hinge on huge action scenes. So a perfect story. The new characters are very nicely introduced, such as Black Panther who is important in the story and isn't crowded out by the other members of the team. The fact that all the characters feel more connected and he makes a valuable addition to the Marvel Universe. The only thing missing is a comedic connection, but this is made up for with some spectacular action.The action scenes are stunning. The one at the airport is one of the best I've seen, as it's so well directed and it shines with the new additions to the team. The film isn't all action though and some of the more touching, character driven moments really ring true through the fights. The whole film, from the way it's directed, to the action, to characters is all perfectly played and perfectly done. I can' really think of a single fault, the lack of comedy isn't really an issue as the film flies along at a great pace. The film doesn't feel as long as it is, and that is always the sign of a perfect film.Overall, all elements of Civil War are stunning. There is nothing wrong with it and it's certainly the best Marvel film to date and we, as superhero movie fans, couldn't of asked for anything more.",10,8,18,11 May 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," The third one's always the worst
","Well, this isn't technically the 3rd film in the ever expanding X-Men franchise, but it is the 3rd in the prequel trilogy, and it's hopefully the last. X-Men Apocalypse is about the alleged first mutant who wants to 'cleanse' the Earth and keep alive only the strong. The X-Men try to stop him, and the film starts in Ancient Egypt and this is never a good sign as the plot has too many strands which makes it rather complex. This isn't a criticism as all the plot elements are nicely brought together and overall the plot is OK. Michael Fassbender returns as Magneto and his character is seen in a different light in the 1st act; it's good character development for Magneto. Jennifer Lawrence and James McAvoy do what you expect them to do, which is put in good performances. They aren't challenged as the script is nothing special but it's certainly not the worst writing I've seen.So what I've said so far suggests the film is mediocre and this is true but it needn't of been. The part of the film, leading up to the final battle is actually pretty enjoyable. It moves along well and I was really getting into the film. Couple this with Quicksilver's scene( the best part of the film by a mile) and it looks like a grand finale is in store. However, the finale is very predictable, as you could easily guess what was going to happen and there was no intrigue there at all. It was very standard action movie CGI stuff, so I actually found it pretty boring and it really spoils the good work of the rest of the film. It feels like the film builds to a climax that isn't what is should be: it's just a CGI, seen it all before fest. Despite this, the newcomers Ben Hardy and Sophie Turner excel in there roles and show why they should be in more blockbusters in the future.Overall, the decent script and decent acting can't help X-Men Apocalypse which loses it way in the final act, even though the promise was there. The predictability of the finale and the CGI heavy action really make it boring. I'm all for action scenes but this needed to feel more realistic (if that's possible in a superhero film) and more physical. I enjoyed parts of it, but it could of been so much better.",7,1,6,25 May 2016
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The Ultimate Superhero Movie
","Avengers: Age of Ultron is all about the rise of Tony Stark supposed peacekeeping program, Ultron, who I'm sure will become an iconic villain, as he tries to destroy the human race.To start with, this film is brilliant. It has everything. Comedy, action, suspense and strong characters. The comedic elements in the film, mainly at the start of the film, work really well and create chemistry between the superhero's, which was lacking in the first film. Next, the action sequences are prolonged and a bit mad, but not on a Michael Bay level. The sequences work really well, and the best piece of action is the Iron Man v Hulk scene, which wows and adds more to the characters. Apart from the action, some backstop is explored mainly of Black Widow, which, again, works really well, as do the edition of all the new characters. They never feel lost to the egos of Captain America and Iron Man, and give the film an angle the first one never had in the end: A feeling of sadness and tragedy at the ending, and it is set up perfectly for more Avengers movies.Overall, if you have any sense, you will see this film and love it when it finishes.",9,4,11,26 April 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Terrific fun
","Batman v Superman is a film with 2 pressures: hype and pleasing a huge fan base. I was certainly caught up the hype, and I feel like it lives up to in in almost all aspects of the movie. I'm also sure the fans would be pleased, as it's actually a very impressive film. As the title the suggests, the film is about Batman v Superman, which occurs for a variety of reasons which are explained reasonably well in the movie, and also features Lex Luther plotting a master plan as you would expect. The main cast include Ben Affleck as Batman, who does an exceptional job and he makes the role his own. Henry Cavill continues as Superman, a role which he suits pretty well, and does well, although I felt Affleck was better in his performance. Jesse Einsburg has a cracking go at portraying Lex Luther, and he brings a strange and psychotic nature to the role, with some terrific acting. All the other cast do just fine (e.g. Amy Adams as Lois Lane)and there aren't any problems with the performances. The action sequences are very impressive, as they have a physical feel despite being laden with CGI. This shows in the final act, which uses an incredible amount of CGI, but this doesn't devalue the film. The score is also very good, and it accompanied the film very well. The script is also well written, and it isn't clichéd and the dialogue is very impressive, with the characters embracing the value of saying quality lines.Despite these good points, Batman v Superman is a little bit let down by messy storytelling at the beginning and I found it difficult to follow the plot to start with and the opening is a bit all over the place to be honest. The strands of the story do eventually connect up, but it could of been a lot cleaner. Another minor problem is Wonder Women, and whether she is needed in the film. It's debatable, but I liked it as she is well introduced when she finally appears, and I would of liked to see her in a larger portion of the film. I also felt the movie is a little bit over the top and it does get ridiculous at times.Overall, Batman v Superman has all you'd expect from a superhero film: Big action, lots of CGI, and generally being over the top. What it also has which some films of this type don't is quality acting and a good script, which certainly make DC's latest film worth a watch. It's pure superhero madness.",9,10,17,5 April 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Brilliant film
","Kingsman is brilliant. Lets not mess around here, it's a truly fantastic movie. Matthew Vaughn delivers a cracking spy film which delivers thrills and spills but also emotion so you can connect with the characters.The acting in Kingsman in sublime. Colin Firth puts in a stellar performance, acting with grit and getting the comedic side bang on. Newcomer Taron Egerton is also fantastic, getting the right balance between hard man and nice man, without making his character too clichéd. The action and soundtrack are 2 other things which really stood out for me in this film, with the action sequences shot in a very unique and stylistic way that makes the action enthralling. The finale, without spoiling it, it particularly good for action sequences. The soundtrack is a mix of composed music made directly for the film and well known songs, like Guardians of the Galaxy. This works really well, and gives the film a fun tone and makes you smile.The only reason this doesn't get a ten is because it felt a bit short in places, especially when Eggsy is training. Hopefully this will be extended on DVD, to add that extra bit of story. Maybe the back story was too confusing. Make up your own mind. Watch this film.",9,5,13,23 February 2015
