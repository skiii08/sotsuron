The Benchwarmers," Happy Madison strikes again!
","You know what? After all of the criticism I had heard surrounding this movie, I fully expected it to be horrible. But once again, it turns out that snobby critics just don't seem to understand Adam Sandlers sense of humor. Regardless of their ignorance, this was the funniest movie of 2006. Jon Heder (Napoleon) proves that he's pretty much going to make people laugh whenever he opens his mouth. Benchwarmers had a lot of the guys from the Longest Yard, which was the last movie to be as funny as this one. I wasn't looking forward to David Spade, who had avoided actually funny movies since Joe Dirt, but he really rocked in this one. You could easily forget who the actor was because he looked so different. His brother, despite being weirder than all get out (eg: eating Sun Screen from the bottle) was hilarious. The movie does have plenty of bathroom humor, groin hits and physical humor, but it's always done just right. In one scene, Heder hits himself three times in a row with his own bat, but it just gets funnier each time. As a movie in general, this was really quite good, but as far as comedies this year, I give it a ten out of ten.",10,1,3,29 April 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Not as Good as Advertised
","I had hoped that since the last Hulk movie came out only five years ago that this one would be something really incredible, something so good that it couldn't have waited. And it wasn't.The movie tries to be too dramatic. Several scenes go into slow motion and drag themselves out, trying for drama but just taking more time. It seemed as though they were ignoring the pattern of a story (beginning, rising action, etc...) and just went for climax after climax, which I didn't buy into because there was no rising action.The visual effects were impressive, but personally I can't enjoy a film that is powered mainly on how it looks. That can only be cool for so long.In the end, I didn't really care much about any of the characters. Emil Blonsky was the most forced of them all, who just seems to be the generic bad guy without being an awesome bad guy.slight spoilers!!! Towards the end of the movie, the Hulk does a 'Hulk Smash' by pounding on the ground, and he unfortunately says, 'Hulk Smash!' right before he does it. It felt like hearing 'it's morphing time' or something equally cheesy.My personal recommendation is to play Hulk: Ultimate Destruction instead.",4,5,11,17 June 2008
Life Is Beautiful," Top three best movies of all time
","I think that people are initially very hesitant of watching this movie because of the subtitles. IT IS WORTH IT. My wife was not excited at all, but later admitted that she loved it. It is her favorite movie now, and I can't blame her at all. I'm a guy, and I like guy movies, but this movie will make the most macho man in the world have at least an allergic reaction. Between my wife and myself, we probably used half of a box of tissues. I don't think that a movie has ever been so serious and funny and romantic all in one. Everything is done so well, and it's clean. A child could watch it, as long as they could read, but an intellectual movie buff is not above this movie. Ten out of ten. I don't think that any part of the movie could have been improved on.",10,1,4,13 March 2006
