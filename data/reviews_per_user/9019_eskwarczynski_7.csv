10 Cloverfield Lane," An intense, claustrophobic thriller that will make even the veteran movie-goer squirm in their seat.
","It's difficult to review a film like 10 Cloverfield Lane because the film is best experienced when the viewer has no earthly idea what it is about. So in this very short review, I simply plead with you to go see this movie if you haven't already. It's a well- crafted thriller that grabs a hold of you and never lets go. I can't remember the last time a movie had me on the edge of my seat like this. The beautifully eerie cinematography and perfect score by Bear Mcreary (The Walking Dead) set the foundation for the suspenseful ride that is, 10 Cloverfield Lane. John Goodman gives an Academy Award level performance that is generally unexpected in this type of movie. Mary Elisabeth Winstead plays one of the greatest protagonists in recent memory for a horror/thriller picture. (She's come a long way as an actress since Final Destination 3!) This film also brings John Gallagher, Jr. to my attention for the first time - not counting Jonah Hex, because I remember nothing from that awful movie - anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if he became a household name in the next few years. There were no weak links in the cast.The suspense in the movie builds quickly but steadily, never over-working itself or feeling as though the director is rushing to get to the next scare. The movie taunts you and misdirects you over and over, until what I believed to be an incredible climax. Apparently some were not thrilled with the ending, although I think it was perfect. However, in the end, it doesn't matter. Watching the characters develop and this terrifying plot unfold is such a satisfying journey that no matter how you feel about the ending of the film, you'll be glad you were a part of the ride that took you there.",9,2,4,21 March 2016
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A near-perfect film for any age.
","For most directors, a film like E.T. The Extra Terrestrial would mark the pinnacle of their filmography. It is a near perfect movie in every way. The effects are well- executed, the cast - both child and adult - are perfect in their roles (young Drew Barrymore is absolutely adorable), and not a minute of the two-hour run-time feels wasted.Spielberg is a masterful storyteller, adding little touches that elevate this simple story to being an unforgettable classic.Whether young or old, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial deserves your attention.",9,1,1,6 April 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A lifeless replica of what once was.
","If I were to re-purpose Biblical language for this review, I would say that Rogue One 'having a form of Star Wars, lacks the power thereof.'The movie makes every attempt to look like a Star Wars Movie, with its admittedly beautiful sets, gorgeous locations and elaborate costuming.Unfortunately, it fails to do what it needed to do - feel like a Star Wars movie.Rather than a fun and immersive cinematic blockbuster with interesting characters, Rogue One - in spite of all it's external trappings - feels like an empty shell of what we know and love.Not one character earns the viewer's investment. Not one action piece holds any gravity or weight. Not one note of the soundtrack is memorable. Character motivations are difficult to grasp; with main characters having personalities that change erratically.Perhaps the saddest thing was seeing terrible CGI flooding the film, a bitter reminder of where the prequels failed.Director Gareth Edwards proves once more that Godzilla was not a misstep on his part, it's his modus operandi - shallow characters, clunky exposition, and a handful of impressive shots that make for a trailer good enough to lure fans into a theater.",2,10,16,6 April 2017
The Terminator," The effects may be dated, but the story is timeless.
","Although this film has been almost completely overshadowed by it's vastly superior and instantly classic sequel, Terminator deserves a place among the greatest sci-fi action films of all time. What James Cameron was able to accomplish with a measly six million dollar budget is absolutely incredible. The style of the film is easily comparable to Halloween, the horror classic which released six years earlier. An unstoppable antagonist chasing down an initially weak protagonist. This game of cat and mouse is thrilling, and would be perfected by Cameron in Terminator 2.The film has some flaws, most typical of lower budget and independent fare. The score is primarily synthesizer sounds. Performances range from good to bad – Linda Hamilton certainly developed as an actress in a big way by her 1992 return to the franchise. Effects are a fifty/fifty between jaw-dropping and cringe-inducing, although it should be noted that Stan Winston's designs are incredible in every case.Overall, this is a wonderful film with a few minor issues, and should be seen by anyone who considers themselves a fan of the genre.",8,1,3,21 March 2016
Alien," In space, no one can hear you snore...
","Beautiful cinematography and incredible visual effects can't save a painfully generic and rather mediocre film. I've watched Alien twice, both times causing me to scratch my head in regards to why it is considered to be a classic.Yes, the poster is cool, the tag-line is cool, the production design is cool, and Sigourney Weaver is obviously really cool. But the movie just isn't. It's an unoriginal slasher film that takes place on a spaceship.Unlike Mad Max: Fury Road – which also has a minimalist story – the action in Alien doesn't lead anywhere, it just sort of happens periodically. Overall, it feels like a walk through an overproduced haunted house at a county fair. The sets may be realistic but the scares often fall flat.",3,5,14,21 March 2016
Trainspotting," Vibrant, hilarious, tragic – sometimes all at once.
","Trainspotting is a strong entry from visionary filmmaker Danny Boyle.Much like the drug-induced dreams of its characters, Trainspotting manages to be vibrant, colorful, hilarious, tragic, and gut-wrenching - often all at once.With a slim hour and forty-five-minute runtime, the narrative rockets forward at a breakneck pace. However, in spite of the leanness and speed, no character feels shortchanged. Each arc is treated by Boyle and the writers with the necessary respect and attention - especially when it comes to Renton's (played wonderfully by a young Ewan McGregor.)Not since Malcolm McDowell's Alex of Clockwork Orange has such a despicable character been so watchable or come across this - dare I say - likable.Perhaps this attraction to the character is because Renton is sadly a mirror image of whom we all have been at some point. Sure, we may not be heroin junkies looking for 'one last hit.' But we have all made promises to ourselves to rid ourselves of some vice after that 'one last time.' Like it or not, Renton is us. He is a human being. Depraved and unable to 'choose life' - no matter how much he may want to. He will always be driven by a quest for pleasure - regardless of how unsustainable or finite that pleasure may be.Overall, Boyle's powerhouse directing, an incredible cast, and strong imagery make Trainspotting a unique and necessary cinematic experience.",10,0,1,6 April 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," A film where style IS the substance.
","Occasionally, films will be criticized for having style over substance. With Mad Max: Fury Road, the style IS the substance. Every frame of George Miller's post-apocalyptic epic is rich with detail and a near obsessive level of perfection. At first glance, the story is minimal, although with repeated viewing, the many layers to the film become more obvious.The amount of the story you recognize is irrelevant however, because this is a spectacle film in it's truest form. Dialogue is minimal, yet every action sequence is it's own coherent story playing into a larger whole. No punch, turn, or grunt is without consequence or meaning. This lends itself to multiple viewings, each one revealing more than the last.Visually stunning, deceivingly shallow, ultimately deep and captivating.Find the biggest TV you can and watch Mad Max: Fury Road. You need to experience it, now.",10,2,11,21 March 2016
