10 Cloverfield Lane," Beyond a sequel...and just entertaining
","No spoilers...don't worry. After watching Cloverfield, I first hated the shaky cam on purpose idea, but the theme of the movie got me. Then I watched Super8, which made me realize that JJ is actually a good storyteller. By not showing what is scary, he lets his actors and the story make people enjoy the film without demanding a monster after 10 minutes. Force Awakens was pretty much an ALL YOU CAN EAT Buffet of stories in movie world, so don't judge him for not being more original in that one. 10 Clov. Lane had enough of everything to give you a grin due Goodman's awesome acting, an eyebrow raise to the OOH Shoot moment and enough edge to expect more. Some people will probably say that WTF does this story have anything to do with the 1st. Hence my title, it is not just a sequel, nor a prequel. You can watch both in any order and you will enjoy both, in my opinion. 1 point to fix would be Emmet's character and perhaps the actor's take on it. He is first portrayed as someone dumb whitted, not knowing the difference between North and South Korea, but then later on figuring some stuff out and actually being smarter than he seemed. But it wasn't that kind of a movie to have a character that either A: develops into a smart young man or B: is secretive about who he really is. So the writers should have just have him stick with one side. The 2 leads were awesome, I really enjoyed the attention to detail in directing. After watching BatmanVsSouperman and just being tired of watching something that should have been better foreshadowed for 3 hours, this film uses almost every shot to it's benefit in the future. And one thing I can spoil you with is this : I hope and I think there will be a sequel. There has to be....you will see",8,2,4,29 March 2016
Suicide Squad," Would have worked better as a Sequel...Maybe to a standalone Batman film
","First I want to start by asking why did Ayer have a small moment of appreciation for Snyder, by having a giant smily face for 2 secs...Thanks for reminding us that Snyder still has DC Comic movies by the 'balls'... The good parts : Harley: overall justice has been done to the character by the actress Katana: Interesting addition and well played ElDiablo: I always enjoy watching Jay H. as he is a pretty good actor. The OK parts: Joker:Comparing any Jokers or 'J's to Ledgers is not fun anymore, as nobody will bring the same level of intensity and non-chalant-ness to CHAOS as he did. But Leto's J is interesting, different and weird in a comic way. I didn't get much violence out of him except that he robs and shoots...but jumping into Acid.....again...if this was a Batman film where we see that J is super in love with Harley...we would appreciate Leto's sadness and overall depressive state in this movie more..than we did... THE BAD::::: Why open with 2 main characters, then give us the credits and then tell us the story....only to then go back and tell us more about the other Squad members? So if Enchantress was so bad and evil and pretty powerful...why just have her hang around as a human...And if June Moone(seriously??) hates being Ench. so much...how can she wake up one moment and want to say it...? Ench. could leave the room and go to Iran...but she couldn't leave the room and go to Amanda to pick her 'heart' up... And her brother seems pretty cool too...wouldn't you want to warn everyone involved to watch out for scary brothers...and probably not keep his doll in a small room hanging out on his own... This is one of the few movies that reveal the villain in the 1st 10 minutes of the film. OK ...with Fant4, we all know that Doom is coming... And this film is the 2nd most recent superhero movie that cheats the fans by picking a villain from the list of already present people. Last one was Avengers and made Loki the bad guy... Will Smith: He still acts like a stick and has either very emotional moments with watering eyes...or dumb way of delivering the already bad Dr.Phil jokes.. Who shot at the helicopter that brought them down into the city... Why bring slingshot only to get rid of him after 5 minutes? The first part of the movie is about MetaHumans...but Harley, DShot,Boomer and sling are not meta...just human... Ench. EVIL DANCE during the whole last scene...why did she look like she needed to PEE? And yes...going back to the start..This movie would have worked better and make so much more sense if it were a sequel to a Batman movie...or SSquad 1....Instead of watching rushed flashbacks, rushed action scenes and no real set up as the set up was already ruined by ComicCon trailer...Perhaps David Ayers talent was shown in the my favorite part of the film...ElDiablo.. as Ayer is best at capturing the ghetto and gangster characters in all of his films...he did it again here...but the rest of the film...not so much.",6,0,2,10 August 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," WHY?Simply WHY sums up my view of this movie...
","There are so many open ended questions after watching this film, that I chose to ask only a few. Why did the studio gave a movie about giants of superhero world to Mr. Green room? Was it really because he would save costs by shooting the film in green room? Why is everyone in love with Frank Miller and his adaptations of comic books?Is it because he is the hip guy now?I am not a fan of Sin City, didn't watch the 2nd one and we all know what happened when they let Frank direct a movie of his own. Why is Lex Luthor trying to kill Sman?What was the point of having Bman and SMan fight?Why did it have to be Ben Affleck?Even Matt Damon would have been a better choice. Why is the movie so dark hued? Not the theme, but the coloring of the whole movie?Snyder did in 300, Watchmen and MofSteel...I guess people enjoy that...right?Louis Lane literally can't move around without Sman saving her...She even realized that herself finally.WHY?Why does Bman have not 1 but 2 dream sequences?Why did Snyder literally took Nolan's WHERE IS SHE and re-used it in this film?Why is Bman tattooing everyone...is that suppose to be Snyder's I AM BATMAN equivalent?Why is the whole America complaining about Sman destroying the city, many many times, if at the end they literally shoot a nuclear weapon, decided within a matter of seconds?Why are all reviews raving about WonderWoman...She only has maybe 6 minutes of screen time, and most of it is about ATMing, crashing parties, steeling stuff and walking away. Why does walk away from stuff so much?Why is Louis Lane's boss such a wussy...She wants something,1st is no..then it's YES...every time. Then why is he so hard on Kent for trying to uncover Bman? Why is Bman swearing so much?Why is Bman shooting guns?Wouldn't we just watch a Affleck movie without a costume where he shoots bad guys?And Why NOT let Affleck direct? He is a better director than he is an actor, let's be honest! Why ...WHY let Snyder become the Jos Whedon of the DC comics , allowing him to move on to Justice League movies?How did LouisLane know that the spear would kill the Doomsday, alone on that pier?HOW did Bman get his hands on the ROCK, after Sman stopped his car during that mess of a truck chase?When I saw the trailer, I couldn't believe they let Irons say that stupid line of.. POWERLESS...NESS...or the Affleck's DO YOU BLEED?...YOU WILL?...Sman didn't even hear that part. Like I said...lot of open ended questions and I think Snyder just ruined my favorite superhero adaptations forever(Batman..not Sman)",6,1,2,26 March 2016
Furious 7," The good...the bad....the end.???
","Dear movie fans...I base this review strictly on my opinion without agreeing or disagreeing with anyone on IMDb or around the world....The BAD: Directing....No racism involved, but why in the world did they switch an Asian director with another Asian director? Was there a point in this? After watching this movie I am convinced that McG or Peter Berg would do a much better job. By the end of the whole thing I felt I like was watching a Zack Snyder movie. Not because of excellent CGI skills with Paul Walker's double (not that Zack's CGI skills are excellent) but because it felt more like Man of Steel than Furious franchise topper. OR even worse...Avengers...seriously the whole LA gets destroyed like NY was in Avengers 1st one....WHY...HOW...WHY every place Shaw shows up gets blown up...WHY....whats the point?Script: Who ...seriously who wrote this script? A 6 year old...I mean beside the fact that none of the actors knew how to deliver a punch line when it was suppose to be brought...why were the dialogues so played out and just stupid....Acting: First, not every wrestler/fighter is a good actor. Rock and John Cena are exceptions to the rule. I still think Be Cool was Rock's best role. Why did they have that female MMA fighter in that role, say a few words and then not deliver an end to her character...she gets knocked out by a fall and thats it...she is gone. If you were to bring someone famous to a role...finish the role properly..or just bring someone who can ACT. Second, after this movie I am also convinced that Vin Diesel should be our next Batman. I mean any deeper voice and nobody can understand him. Third Tyrese and Luda are just bad....come on..Can I check my email??? Really that was suppose to be funny...nope ...dead line like every line they both brought. And back to Hobbs...whats with the REDNECK remarks? Story: God's eye? The best name they came up with? Eagle Eye didn't come up as a film where an almost similar technology was used so obvious movie fans would call this a copy of that idea in that film. So Shaw hunts them...even though he had a USB with all of them he technically only took one out in Japan the rest just followed Dom...Then they loose Shaw and really cannot locate him until this Mr.Nobody shows up to help them find him...but they don't really need to do all of this dangerous work since Shaw shows up everywhere anyways...Besides the question of HOW does he show up everywhere, why do they need this EYE thing if Shaw is going to come anyways. Mr. Nobody winking and almost dying...then only get rescued in a second and be OK....Then say goodbye and we never know what happened to him?Thank you. How did Letti know that Brian is running on the bus to jump?WHY does Hobbs have a daughter? And how is this important to the whole story? Race world , we started it? Really when? Looked more like Nitro circus episode. Wouldn't it just be really much better to make this a one by one death story. Shaw finds them and takes them out until he reaches Brian and Dom. Dom lets Brian live to have one last fight with Shaw. Kicks his ass, Hobbs catches him end of story. Brian lives forever in our hearts while we never have to see Tyrese and Luda ever again in this franchise if it ever were to come back. I remember everything...2 minute BS , flashbacks....then again??? I remember everything...wow...what an end...Abu Dhabi? Why not Dubai? Abu Dhabi is what Ottawa is to Canada ...nice to visit but boring and too political...And why show us the dunes and stuff....we know where Middle East is...we know it's full of sand...again instead of dunes show us some races...Racing movie remember?... THE GOOD: Tony JAA: Old but still awesome. Excellent work on Paul Walker's face. The BEST for last...: The last 1 minute monologue by Diesel and moment of Paul Walker. Very touching and full of that Paul Walker grace that we will miss...I really hope they don't come back and if they do, please bring a director who was not only known for his scary movies, good scary movies too and somehow switched from tortures and ghosts to...cars and action...",6,1,13,18 April 2015
