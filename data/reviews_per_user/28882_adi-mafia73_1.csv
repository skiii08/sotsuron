Iron Man 3," Waste of time
","how much powerful is the villain ,hero always win ,But there should be some logic behind this either the hero is so intelligent or he is using latest tech. There are many scenes in this film which I did not understand one is, Hero fall from the sky ,his suit remain unbroken even his bones:-) but at this point I am concerned with suit only but at the near-end when hero was not in the suit and iron suit hit with the truck ,suit broken into pieces..what a good movie.. What a big coincidence that when hero fall ,he fall thousands of miles away (as tony said ) , IN THE SAME CITY where chad davis used to live ....whats this ..:-@",1,2,6,23 August 2013
