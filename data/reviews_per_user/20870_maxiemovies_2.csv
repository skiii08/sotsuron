First Man," An Existential Trip
","This was a beautiful movie, shot in three different formats (16mm, 35mm, and 70mm IMAX) it completely blew me away with how touching and awe-inspiring it was. Especially when we first step on the moon with Neil (not really a spoiler).At times this felt like it was Tarkovsky-esque with it's lingering shots that show more than just an image but a meditation of what can be; of where we can go. There are some flaws but. and I don't say this lightly, but if you can look past some of the gratuitously shaky 16mm shots of Gosling's face, you've got this generations 2001.Strong film. Hopefully will get some serious nominations this year.",9,1,3,4 November 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Peak McDonagh
","I have always found McDonagh has seemed to at least struggle to translate the mix of comedy abusism and realism found in this stageplays into his movies but it seems like he's found a way to finally edge it in here.Billboards is a touching, absurd yet realist piece of cinema that touches on all things political and finds room not only to poke fun at them but also give a deep commentary. McDormand, Harrelson, Hedges, and Landry-Jones all give wonderful performances that compliment McDonagh's script brilliantly; so much so that you can find yourself suspending disbelief and getting lost in the absurdity - which is hard to do even in movies like this (Coen Brothers included).But the real gem here is Sam Rockwell. His performance is why this film touched so many people and grabbed the success it did. His redemption arc may be one of the most powerful and biggest in cinematic history; and it's believable, too.McDonagh's message seems to be 'everybody deserves a second chance' and it's very hard to disagree. Great movie.",8,0,2,9 November 2018
