Iron Man 3," Better than people are saying
","I loved the film, nice follow up to the Avengers, although overall not as great. This doesn't mean that the film was bad, there were a lot of laughs, good actions sequences, and special effects, the 3D aspect didn't really add much though. The twist can be disappointing to some hardcore fans but I feel that many people just laugh and enjoy it when the shock wears off, although because of the twist the trailers are very misleading. Its also not as dark as the trailers conveyed , there is a lot of humour, with some great comedic timing from Robert Downey Jr. There are quite a lot of Goofs in this movie ( I even spotted some in theatre at my first viewing) but it doesn't take away any of the fun from this great movie",8,1,3,14 June 2013
