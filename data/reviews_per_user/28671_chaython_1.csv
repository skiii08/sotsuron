Insidious: Chapter 2," Cheesy
","This movie is very cheesy and boring. Horrible acting! Boring me to death. Some sort of supposed horror not scary at all kind of funny. Well, I guess most horrors are a lot like this but this is the most pathetic one I've ever watched. Something to do with a mysterious satanic demon. The classic eerie music that is meant to add drama collides with the false attitude of the film making a laughable scene. Everything feels over dramatized and stretched out yet it jumps around in an irrelevant matter. I hope no one will ever view this outrageous nonsense ever again. Police believe the male character murdered this lady who was some sort of exorcist. They blame it on some demon or ghost. The man yells at the female character enraged by her partial decision to blame him for such things also.",1,6,11,10 December 2013
