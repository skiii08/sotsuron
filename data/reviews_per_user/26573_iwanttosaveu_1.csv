United 93," Deeply upsetting and powerfully brilliant
","This movie is incredible, it tells the story of the fourth hijacked plane on September 11th 2001, this day will always live in my mind as i was at school and came in after lunch to hear the news, i will never forget getting home and seeing the scenes on sky news The film is shot brilliantly with hand-held cameras to shows the chaotic atmosphere on board the plane and in the several air control centres across the US.The film is deeply emotional and had me in tears at several moments during the film, the major one being when ************************ spoiler******** the air controllers at Newark actually watch first hand as the plane hits the trade centre *************spoiler************************** as i left the cinema i was in utter shock and disbelief at what i had seen, it is mind boggling to imagine what took place on flight 93 and any of the other planes that were involved that day.this film is definitely not for the over sensitive and will most likely stick in your mind for a good few years to come",Null,1,2,2 June 2006
