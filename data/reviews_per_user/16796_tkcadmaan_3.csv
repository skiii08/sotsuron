Kill Bill: Vol. 2," An Epic Action Movie
","Tarantino treats both volumes of Kill Bill as a single movie, and I feel that is true. At first I thought that perhaps the director took too long to arrange certain scenes, but that is most certainly not the case. Tarantino made sure to give each portion of the story the perfect amount of time that it deserved, and it was wonderful! Lots of action, lots of blood, lots of cliches, but in all the right ways. The first volume in my opinion is the better of the two, and is crucial for understanding the story, so I recommend watching the first volume before this one, or else you would have missed out on a lot of important plot points, even though this movie tries to have a kind of recap at the start. Overall a great action movie with great performances and amazing cinematography and set design, a must see for lovers of Tarantino's work!",8,0,2,20 December 2019
Scarface," Dictionary Definition of a Timeless Classic
","Scarface is one of the greatest Al Pacino movies of all time, his performance in this movie is what drives the plot and dictates the intensity of the best scenes, and of course, one of the greatest one liners in cinema history. The set design is incredibly well done, and it compliments the cinematography of the movie brilliantly as well. A must watch for 80s cinema lovers!",9,1,1,20 December 2019
The Death of Stalin," Frighteningly Hilarious
","Who knew that one of the darkest chapters in history could be made into a movie in such a humorous way? The producers of this movie took the time to develop all aspects of the movie greatly, but the most successful efforts definitely lay in the writing and character portrayals. Each actor achieves wonders in their roles and you cannot help but enjoy their frantic interactions and anticipate their next moves to take power of the Soviet Union after Stalin. Perhaps the hilarity of the events portrayed in this movie shed a light on to how ridiculous and frightening Stalinist Russia was and what how it drove people into doing things that no one could imagine. If you are a lover of history or this period in general, this is a definite must see!",9,1,2,20 December 2019
