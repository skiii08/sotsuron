Angels & Demons," It's better than Da Vinci Code
","It's better than Da Vinci Code (but Da Vinci Code was really quite bad). From an agnostic's standpoint, it is just an entertaining thriller. The pace was good and Ron Howard did a pretty good job as a director. Except for Ewan McGregor (one of his poorer performances), everyone else was alright. The only exceptional performance perhaps came from Armin Mueller-Stahl. Rome is beautiful and the night shots were quite stunning. There are certain parts of the show that appear to be totally illogical but that could be easily overlooked as the pace of the movie pushes you forward.Just enjoy the movie like you would have enjoyed X-Files or something of that equivalent. Don't let religion stand in your way.",7,4,17,13 May 2009
