Men in Black 3," missing in black
","I giggled a few times. i think I wanted to giggle. I liked MIB. i liked the music, I liked the wit, the style, the fun premise that had always been there as an undercurrent in serious conspiracy films and nutty urban legends but never fully explored. i liked the hard drinking alien worms, the little witty twists- universes inside universes, the common sense street-cop who wins out against educated morons. It seems after the original they got stuck. They seemed to run out of things to say, so simply rehashed the old- the talking pug, universes inside train stations, regrowing alien heads and a storyline stolen from Jewel in the Nile. Here, in the third instalment, they ditched some of the more familiar supporting characters and while I might have applauded that since they already seemed old in the second instalment, they failed to replace them. We still have aliens and their ever-resilient heads in there, but there was a genuine attempt to move things to a fresher place. The time travel storyline should have been brilliant- this was when space/alien mania took off, the birthplace of nutty conspiracy theories combined with swinging sixties free loving, trippy hippy, bring your own bong culture, Get Smart gadgets and a man trying to save the world while being black! It was ripe...and it stank. Okay bad pun but this film deserves it. It's like you can see the chalk marks where they have started to draw in the plot, you can see where they're going, see them circling the joke, but the finished product is just not finished, it should still be sitting on the drawing board in this state. Will Smith appears to be free-winging it in the hope that eventually he'll brainstorm his way to the punchline- he doesn't get there but we do get to enjoy his working process.Jones plays a man who seems to have reached the end and is willing to embrace it....need I put in the obvious line?I'm not going to go into obvious plot spoilers, there are plot holes, always are with time travel, its really not an issue except when you end up sitting there thinking eh? You do a little here, but I think in many ways that is because the storyline is too simple. It makes no real attempt to address (or in the style of MIB, exploit and poke fun at), the inherent issues, such as the grandfather paradox, that inevitably come up with time travel, so that you feel as though you must have missed something.That in the end is what ruins this film. They have tried so hard to avoid the obvious, the cliché, the previous tricks of the franchise that they have left themselves with nothing but holes. The beauty of MIB was not that it avoided clichés but how it played with them, tweaking our expectations in tiny, but deliciously original ways. Without them we are simply left without.",3,27,51,12 June 2012
About Time," Brochure for the perfect life
","One friend of mine describes Curtis as the Marmite man - you either love him or hate him. Another friend can rant about the failings of Love Actually for so long that I start to replay Shallow Grave in my head and recast him as the poor lodger.This is Love Actually mark 2. The familiar Curtis characters, gentle English wit and the ain't life grand message, are all present and correct. The only thing missing is Hugh Grant. But Domhall does a lovely impersonation.Everything was set up perfectly for a great story, one which shows that even with the chance to redo any moment, life goes its own way. Unfortunately Richard never took the opportunity to tell us a story. Instead he delivers one man's life collated in delightful Kodak moments - the kind of life I am sure many a man would have like to have, certainly most of their girlfriends would like to believe so. We have idyllic childhood, bohemian family, endearing romance, with barely a hiccup to mar his perfect existence as the years slide by. Richard Curtis has said this is his last film and perhaps it is best it is. If he cannot bring himself to write even one day of rain and screaming children into his character's life, does he really have anything to say that a John Lewis ad can't do in a fraction of the time? Enjoy on a rainy day, take someone you can curl up with, while the rose coloured glasses are still on and see the life you'd like to imagine you might have unfold. Just don't go for a riveting story.",6,1,5,10 September 2013
Man of Steel," I weep..
","I'll confess I didn't weep, I came very close though. I was open minded, waiting, willing, then around a third of the way through I realised that what I was watching was more than just a film, another blockbuster, a popcorn munching way to while away the summer evening, what I was really watching was the moment story died..This is a truly awful film.It is beautifully shot, the costume almost inspires rather than inducing sniggers, the acting is quiet, understated, the CGI so effective they have almost crossed that last lingering barrier where real and manipulated are indistinguishable. The scale is epic.And despite all of that I will repeat: this is a truly awful film. None of the above can redeem it. And its not an opinion, its a fact.Some people have enjoyed it, a few I was with enjoyed it. And still, this is a truly awful film. That is not an opinion.I really wanted to walk out, but I had a large pick and mix bucket and I dug deep and found the sugary will to endure.Normally I try to give a balanced view, but I am sick of doing so. I am sick of giving the benefit of the doubt to people who quite clearly are making millions doing something they are unqualified to do: tell stories.If you want characters, likable or interesting or funny or curious, just some - any- sense of character, this is not the film for you.if you want humour, wry wit, cheesy gags, gentle social commentary, daft slapstick, this is not the film for you.if you want mystery, intrigue, wonder, this is not the film for you.if you want relationships, conflict born from fear and hope, blossoming romance, unrequited love, this is not the film for you.if you want dialogue that stays with you, that will be quoted years from now, that makes you lean forward as if physically pulled into the story, this is not the film for you.If you want mindless violence and a battle scene that lasts for three quarters of the movie, then this is the film for you.If you want to know the entire story in the first five minutes, this is the film for you.if you want the same story that every superman before this has already told, in a thousand rehashed, reheated ways.. this is the film for you.In twenty years, people will still revisit the original film. No one will revisit this. Its special effects will be outdated in a year - so will any possible appeal.I will repeat: this is a truly awful film. And that is not an opinion.",1,291,572,17 June 2013
Ex Machina," glossy horror masquerading as philosophy
","*minor spoilers*This isn't what it appears - or promises - to be. Intentionally? I'm not sure.I'm a sci-fi girl. I don't mind a little horror mixed in, but I'm looking for things that challenge and ask questions. The kind of questions that raise more questions, not answers.This isn't that kind of film, yet most of the reviews suggest it is. If humanity is under the microscope, and its clearly not a very high quality one, then its the humans that offer insight, not the AI. The so called intelligence is unexplained,undefined and totally derivative. Meanwhile the human who created them is, with the power of life and death at his fingertips, rendered a monster. He answers to no one, and nothing, is unstoppable, alone in his mountain majesty, a god who like so many in the realm of fiction is smarter that the machines he builds or in fact anyone except another God.The limitless abundance of his abilities - or resources - reduces any chance the AI might have possessed to truly answer any notion of what it means to be human. Even Data doesn't possess everything that this AI does.Of course it's a time honoured thing looking at us and our perception of life as a way of measuring it - but I'd look to Bladerunner as the way to do that well.It also suffers from wanting to look and sound good, and it does, but at the expense of great story, believable scenarios and intriguing twists. Too many long silences, quotable memes instead of dialogue and high school level symbolism. In the end it felt cheap but pretty. And the music was a bit annoying.",4,2,4,5 June 2017
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight Wanders
","With the dark knight rises about to hit cinema screens it has got me thinking. Perhaps because I was never a huge fan of the franchise I haven't been as aware of the hype in the way I felt it surrounding the Star Wars Prequels. There has however been something of a slow burn that is now starting to ignite, and it has about it the sense of pomp and solemnity that was first given to the series with Heath Ledgers untimely death, something that now suggests to the world at large that this is more than simple entertainment.I'm going to have to disagree..this is less than simple entertainment. And since first, last and every minute in between I am looking to be entertained by a movie, that raises a problem. The dark knight is a film that takes itself seriously. I don't intrinsically have a problem with that. A lot of movies could learn from that. In this self reflexive self congratulatory age where the endless in-jokes, jobs for your mates and wouldn't -this- be -clever- even- if- it -doesn't- fit- at- all style abounds, film makers who are completely absorbed in the world they are presenting is not a bad thing. We go to escape this world, if they don't believe in their own reality how can we? The problem is this film takes it's STATUS seriously. The film itself, the story, the characters, the tiny details that add up to make us believe and care about what is unfolding before us, to draw us in biting our nails in horror and hope? That kind of got forgotten in the heady glow of epic ideas and mythic imaginings.Batman, the unsung hero, vilified despite giving everything- the idea stirs my soul. the execution...em did they get round to it? Maybe its still on the drawing board. It was a long film a lot of things had to get cut..but maybe the wrong things? The Joker, the anarchic psychotic apocalypse. Bad because he likes it, without reason, without limits, without a plan..well there is a plan- several actually all very neatly playing into each other. Destroy Batman. Bring Gotham to its knees. Take away all hope. And its executed very well for a man who just likes to create chaos and do what he pleases when he pleases. In fact he is so well thought out he has the entire city running in circles unable to stop him and his well trained army..of recently escaped mental patients..Rachel Dawes, the woman Batman loves but cannot be with in case it puts her in danger. The woman who is engaged to the only other man who is standing against the chaos. The woman who is herself standing against the corruption. The woman who despite not dating Batman, is in mortal jeopardy throughout both films.I can go on. The film did. It dragged. Full of strange circular dialogue with big words and epic nonsense that bored me. The humour was taking a nap and I wanted to. Every time I thought it was going to be over, it went off on another random plot line. A film should take you inside as if it were real, make you cower like those first film goers as that train hurtled towards them. This was flat images on a flat screen, big, fancy, long.",Null,4,7,15 July 2012
Elysium," Paradise lost..or simply never found?
","This is a very well made film. Neill Blomkamp shows, as he did in District 9, his visual effects origins, building a realistic and gritty dystopian landscape. The Taurus ring that is Elysium hangs like a chalky oversized moon in the smog, an aspiration to the young Max as elusive and irresistible as the stars.The acting is faultlessly underplayed, pretty much as you'd expect from Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. Sharlto Copley is terrifyingly absurd, showing on the back of his everyman in District 9 he has a reach and distinctiveness that could put him up there with the likes of Geoffrey Rush and Alan Rickman, especially when it comes to tortured villains.The violence is graphic and specific, stomach churningly so in some places, yet the director never lingers too long, thus underpinning the casual, everyday nature of it.In short it has everything that a serious Hollywood Blockbuster should have.And yet.. I cannot recommend this film.I've seen poorly made films I would recommend, because despite their inadequacies I enjoyed them. I didn't enjoy this. I didn't hate it either. I didn't really feel anything at all. I couldn't even engage with it. The landscape, the people involved, everything told me this should work and I wanted to get stuck in. But trying to engage with this was like trying to get a grip on a smooth surface. I just kept sliding right back out.The story was thin, though that in itself is not unusual for this kind of film. District 9, which this will inevitably be compared with, was a simple story. However there was in that a compelling human element, brought to life by the central character of Wikus, a bureaucratic little man, who should have lived a little life, thrust into being more than he wanted to be, fighting against everyone and everything, society, law, even his own body, unable to accept that the lines were being increasingly blurred and he could not re draw them.Here we have Matt Damon doing Jason Bourne once again. He does it exceptionally well, a quiet unstated yet deeply felt angst, but it gives us our first sense of something being missing. This emptiness pervades the entire film. The scene is set, beautifully, but by the end we are still waiting for the play to begin.The story sets up twists, subtle, believable ones, and never fully explained, because bad guys don't stop to explain their evil plans in real life, yet none come off as such, failing to break the linear, plodding feel of the narrative. And while I am not left with any questions or confusion, there is no depth or texture to what transpired.This is a film by numbers. It ticked all the boxes, it delivered every expected feature, followed the rules, shot straight to the top of the class. But class isn't real life. And it certainly isn't the commercial world. Everything given I could have predicted within the first few minutes. The art-house childhood memories set up the relationship which materialises later, but sadly we are never invested in them as a couple. The same could be said for every character and relationship, emphasis on the latter. The human element has been removed, ironically in an attempt to be as cool and as realistic as possible. But in trying to avoid those established tropes, now derided as cheesy, Blomkamp has ended up avoiding everything. If you take something out, you have to put something back in.You can't make a movie with only your brain. I know how that sounds. But this is not a intellectual pursuit. It is an emotional one. I'd rather cheesy special effects with heart and humour than this dry serious posturing, I'd rather rules were torn up and boundaries were pushed, I'd rather you risked being a laughing stock, the next Ed Wood rather than settle for being the next Ed Who? To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, the only thing worse than being laughed at, is being forgotten. This is one I will forget.",5,0,0,9 September 2013
Alice in Wonderland," A misery in Hollywoodland
","Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.I really wanted to like this. I was genuinely excited. I try to temper my excitement lately, because most of the time it is met with disappointment. And here yet again...The visuals are precisely what you expect of Tim Burton. He never fails to deliver a consistent vision, and while I will agree that may start to grate, especially if it is not your thing to start with, it feels perfect for this film. They should have been a match made in heaven- hence the excitement I could not quash.The performances are good- although the mad hatter and his Scottish split personality was baffling. Alice is also somewhat flatter than she once was, but Mia has charm.So the problem? The same problem that jumps up in far to many of Burtons films. The plot- or rather and I think here this is an important distinction, the story. Alice, the original, was never plotted in that oh so generic manner that most Hollywood films are. In the vein of other journey tales such as The Hobbit, it meandered, revelling in the wonder of its own world, the true narrative arc being the internal one of the main character. In the Hollywood world of inciting incidents, pivotal points, climax, and resolution this is not acceptable. We have, as we must have, a villain, a battle, a swash buckling heroine- god forbid Alice runs and squeals like a normal girl- all the subtlety, ambiguity and irreverent charming nonsense of the original is pushed aside for starkly drawn good versus evil morality, cheap sexual overtones and high stakes 'tension'. I use quotes because the so called tension they attempted to create with the ugly bander-whatever, the dark desires of the Red Queen and the final apocalyptic battle felt about as exciting as Beachgrove Gardens.Burton is not a writer. And I personally feel that to be a great director you have to be a writer. Even if you cannot write dialogue, you must have an instinctive eye for story. He does not. He should have stuck with animation or cinematography. There he excels. I am now at the stage where I will pointedly avoid his films. However if this comes on tele I will say watch it for the lovely visuals, it's free.",3,1,2,1 September 2012
X-Men: First Class," back of the class *potential spoilers*
","If you are going for mindless big action fun, you'll probably be mildly amused and then forget all about it. The special effects are standard not mind blowing, but sufficient. I find personally it is the subtle touches, the emotion evoked rather than big flashy gestures that impress and those were lacking. The jokes are cheesy but in places fun.The fundamental reason this fails is the very same reason that the Return of the Sith failed. Neither of these films respect the inherent conflicts of the main characters and fail miserably to use them to their full potential. For me this film was exciting for one reason and one reason only, the Charles/Erik back story. To see enemies as friends, drawn together by a secret that alienates them from the world, to see prejudice and fear pull them apart until they stand on opposite sides of a chasm they don't know how to bridge. This was the heart that was missing from this movie. They are portrayed as blandly civil allies, temporarily bonded but always clear on their path- which might have worked if that path had been diverted at any point- it wasn't and we know it isn't in the future, the limitation of the prequel. Further potential is squandered in the sister/brother relationship between Mystique and Charles. It could have been a great opportunity to develop Charles and knock him from his perfect perch, as he has the position, easily abused, of benevolent benefactor, as well as friend. Instead he is once again blandly civil in every aspect. Mystique as the premier female baddie of the franchise, is reinvented as mild, sweet and apparently in love with every lead male, which (minus the last point) had potential, yet again it is handled with a shovel.The emotional wasteland is made all the worse by the painfully linear storyline. What happened to Erik after he was separated from his family?Answered in the first five minutes. How has this shaped him as a man? The next five minutes. Which also make sure you know who the bad guy is, just how bad he is and leave no confusion about his villainous interests and why he is working with mutants. Also shoehorned in are various other convenient set-ups which make sure we get instantly bang up to date. So that the next film, which while I'm sure it will have some funky 70's disco tunes, will be pretty much exactly the same in all the respects that matter as every other film in the franchise, just without the wit, depth or resonance that Singer brought to the first two.",4,3,4,26 May 2012
