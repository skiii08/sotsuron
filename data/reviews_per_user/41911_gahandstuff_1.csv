Marie Antoinette," This movie was a disappointment for me and I was so hoping for it not to be.
","As a young girl at the age of 13, I read my first book about Marie Antoinette and fell in love with her. The book was a historical fiction made into a diary about Marie Antoinette and from then on I was always reading about Queens, and above all Marie Antoinette. Before the movie Marie Antoinette came out I had read Anton Frashers book and was glad the director was using this book for the bases for her movie. Before the trailers came out for this movie I was trying to see what the movie would look like. When I saw the trailers I began to get worried for this was nothing like the book Anton Frasher had written or any other book I had read about Marie Antoinette. What ultimately killed this movie for me was the inaccuracy of the fashion; the ridiculous use of color in the costumes and the sound track aka film score. I'm a history person and in this movie Marie Antoinette's life was depicted as a gum ball masquerade only out for the cake. To me this movie was a sell out to little teenage girls with no idea of history or any inclination of who Marie Antoinette was. Marie Antoinette's life had so much sparkle, mystery, suspense and yes color that it didn't need any extra fluff. I just hoped for a movie that would take this persons life seriously but instead it was a mockery and waste of time and money.",1,2,3,1 June 2009
