Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," crude, foolish soporific
","Lucas has spent 20 years perfecting the technology and forgotten that the film needed a script.The 'characters' are slapped together from the offcuts of 40s melodrama. Jah Jah Binks is pathetic, a sorry version of a comedy negro in the Butterfly McQueen tradition. The heroes are given wild costumes, when they should be given thoughtful lines. This film is all look and no substance. Don't waste your time with it.",1,4,7,21 July 1999
