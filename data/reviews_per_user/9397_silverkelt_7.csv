The Monuments Men," Criticism isn't warranted at the level distributed.
","This isn't a overall top ten movie, no matter what genre you might want to categorize it into. However, it doesn't nearly warrant the amount of harsh criticism, angst, hatred, spewed towards with reviews. Its well produced, filmed adequately, and has moments that shine. Acting is OK, with generally polished performances. 1 stars are for trivial , badly produced stories with no endings, there is enough of that artistic trash to warrant tongue lashing if you want to level it at something. The worst you can say about this film, is it doesn't have gravity, you never feel the weight of the importance of its story, nor do you feel the actual components are totally together at times.",6,0,2,13 February 2015
Spider-Man: Homecoming," One of the better Marvel verse ones for kids.
","Its not great.. its not in the top ten out of the PHASE movies, but its better then some of the more recent spider man flicks. Spider man is hard anyways, frankly, not 100% sure why they push so hard to re-release a new spider man every 2-3 years.. its mostly the same story retold over and over..(like DCs batman.. jeepers creepers.. how many batman movies do you need to make.. cant even wait 15 years between.. just push push push push.) Overall though, this is way more kid friendly, which I do appreciate then some of the other films. The humor is friendly enough for most pre-teens to get and the action isn't anywhere as dark and foreboding as the some of the latest other Marvel verse films (age of ultron, winter soldier) both of which was too much for younger viewers.While I think those films have their place, I do appreciate something a bit lighter as a opposite.Worth the watch.",7,10,15,7 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not without imperfection, but vastly better then some are complaining about.
","First off, there are huge holes in this story line, in additional not all the written story script and lines fit together nicely. There are supposed to be parallels and new lessons, but sometimes, they are nonsensical at best, the galaxy seems tired of war, in fact it mostly seems like they would prefer most of the rebels to go away, while in the old films, it was a story of liberty versus totalitarianism, there is no subtle hints about it here, there was more berating over war profiteering then standing up against the first order dictatorship regime. The scenes and sequences between Adam Driver and Daisy Ridleys Kylo and Rey are fairly resplendent, in fact without the two of them, the movie falls fairly flat, not wholly the fault of the actors, the story is the main culprit, where the first movies, are a series of extraordinary heroic events tied together with a faith that the force will eventually set a balance again, the series of events that happens in the movie seem, well odd at best. The second tag story line between Poe, Finn and the new addition of Rose, goes no where, but its half the movie by itself, each of the characters actually work well, it was the story that let them down, hard, the final fight between Finn and Captain Phasma, seems very anti-climatic. You say to yourself after thier parts are done.. like, why did they bother? that was the best they could come up with? Mark Hamill, is fairly dark comedic in this story line, by himself and the moments pin pointing this new aspect of his, worked fine. Where it did not work, was Mark Hammill playing Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master.. this was my take on that 'Dude is seriously messed up, the sum of his whole existence was that he is a whiny brat, who going through a series of events, learns nothing and feels like his 18 old petulant self from movie 1, age, experience , patience, shouldve have thought him a few lessons by now ' Again, was it his take, or was the script calling for a deeply angst and angry Skywalker.. I do not know, but it didnt play well. Carrie Fisher, was just a afterthought in this movie, she mostly tried to reign in the irascible (but well played) Oscar Issacs Poe character, who is brash,arrogant at times and bold. But overall, she spends most of the movie in a coma , meh. There are other minor characters, but they do not add that much overall to the story , in fact Vice Adamirals Holdo played by Laura Dern, was kind of off putting, she had a plan, she had no reason to share it per say, but , really, overall it was a unnecessary character, I dont want to pin that on Laura Dern per se, it was just a superfluous character, giving screen time, that had no overriding prerogative to be in the story line, all of her story, could've just been done by Carrie Fisher, if the elected not to put her in a coma. But again.. these detract , but do not necessarily destroy everything good about the film, its Kylos and Reys galaxy now, everyone else doesn't shine as bright in the film, either via bad story telling, bad writing, or incorrect methodology from the actors to bring them around. That is ok, at least the two main stars carry most of it. Worth the watch and re-watch a few times to get it all in.",8,0,2,20 December 2017
Logan," Solid and entertaining effort, better then the rest of the Wolverine stand alone's.
","With a bit more depth and dramatic flair then its predecessors, this is perhaps one of the best three or four superhero movies ever made, however it really could've explored those depths a bit further and flushed them out. While, I appreciate the effort, those giving this movie a ten , seem a bit enthusiastic about the overall scope of this film. At the same time, I will find it hard to believe, anyone , could in reality bring The Wolverine more to life then Hugh Jackman did, some actors, seem born to play certain roles. Overall? Worth the Watch!",8,24,49,14 August 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Near perfection for a Superhero flick.
","While the maddeningly depressing superhero films Logan and to a lesser extent Wonder Women have higher user average reviews, I actually think GotG2 is better then both, mixing as much humor and vitriol together with conceptualizing the thought of a farther might be, to what he is, and what you are , are all mixed together, this is a 'finding' yourself movie more then it looks when you skim the surface. Not every deep self exploring voyage , has to be done dour like, and GotG 2, proves you can do it with hyper speed humor on crack. Its really one of the better Marvel Universe movies, and doesn't feel tired out like the Iron Man by #3. I would say out of the 17 so far Phase Marvel movies, GotG2, is by far the most fun, it even surpasses the original. Overall, Worth the Watch.",9,0,1,7 November 2017
Prometheus," Like many, could see potential, but scope and execution a problem.
","There is something distant with the movie, you can barely care about any of the characters, it was a disappointment on many levels. Character development, plot line development are either shallow in concept or long in development, with little pay off for either. Overall, the sum of its parts just seem a little disjointed to me. It was pretty clear to me, that they seem to be developing a multi- movie story arc of sorts, and left much to be desired to resolve this one. That being said, its not the worse conceptual sci fi film I've seen, and CGI integration with human actors and overall thematic scenes are very nicely done. Could have achieved more.",6,1,2,2 April 2015
Life," Much more substantial and entertaining then expected.
","In comparison and contrasting Life with the newest Alien Covenant movie, Life, not only blew it away, it also was quite entertaining. It was a refreshing take on the monster in space concept, updated in a way that every Alien movie seems to have missed since Alien 3 at least. In reality its probably closer to a 7, but, I give it a point, for not only being better then any other monster in space movie format in the last few years, but beating my expectations. Overall? Worth the watch.",8,0,1,7 November 2017
