Marie Antoinette," Boring Antoinette
","So, OK. Yesterday I had the great privilege of screening the press showing (attending the press screening?) of Marie Antoinette. First the good news: From what the Ole fashioned Wikipedia (as accurate as we assume it is) has shown me, it was pretty accurate historically. Though, possibly Kirsten 'you got me thirstin' ' Dunst is a little hotter than our heroine, Marie. It was pretty. Lots of pornographic (in the sense that they were indulgent) food shots and plenty of Parisian Haute Cotoure. The bad news? It was long and boring. Turns out Marie didn't do all that much besides gamble and spend money on clothes and apparently gardening. The movie rolls on and on without anything happening and I do mean anything, her young prince husband would not even bed her for several ( a couple?....who can remember) years. The movie finally begins to heat up when Marie takes a lover after the birth of her first daughter. There is some hot Man on Kirsten action that at first makes you not totally regret seeing the movie but then he runs back off to Sweden and that is that. The movie's biggest let down is in the end as it completely washes over Bastille day and the subsequent French Revolution, one of history's bloodiest revolutions but at least there was cheese. There is no trial or beheading. In fact, the movie ends with King and Queen riding off in a coach. Though wait., do i smell a sequel?",4,2,8,17 October 2006
The Prestige," Prestigious.....Not!
","One might say that the best part of 'The Prestige' is the ride to the theater. Those who say that are moronic. On the ride to the movie house you are mistakenly in the frame of mind that what you are about to see will be, in fact, entertaining and watchable. The best part of this film is the ride home for then the most arduous 2 hours spent in a theater in recent time are over. This film explains itself to you via Michael Cain's narrative of the three parts in a Magicians performance: at first an infant mewling and puking in his nurse....wait, thats something different. The First Act is called The Pledge, in which a magician displays an everyday object; act two is The Turn, in which that everyday object is made to do something extraordinary, such as disappear; and act three is The Prestige, in which the object reappears, dazzling an audience too afraid to applaud at the end of act two. The movie basically follows this pattern except The Prestige in this film is not dazzling at all, instead painfully obvious. Anyone who has seen the STTNG Episode 'Second Chances' will not be in the least surprised. Those who haven't and have a brain in their head will not be. That said, my girlfriend and I were the only two people with brains in their head at the screening we attended. This auditorium was dazzled. People will come to see this film because all of the people involved are hot commodities right now. I suspect they will be disappointed.",4,6,20,24 October 2006
