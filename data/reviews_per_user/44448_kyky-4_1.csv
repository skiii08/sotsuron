Hereditary," Do not waste your time...
","First of all - not a horror at all, and although I'm not a typical gore horror fan, this is just pure drama... and not good enough (although I am fan of drama). 2 hrs wasted time of looking on ugly faces (and yes, I mean the children), without any substance. This could've been made into 15 min short film and would still suck... sorry, but all the anticipation, hype etc.... didn't bring anything up... total waste of time.",1,0,1,8 September 2018
