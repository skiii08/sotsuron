Requiem for a Dream," Undeniably powerful
","Requiem for a Dream is perhaps one the most powerful movies that I have seen and is likely responsible for upping the quality of movies that I have watched in the last year or so. The story so involves the viewer through pity, concern and sadness for the fate of the four heroes that it makes it seemingly impossible to turn away during even the most difficult of scenes. (And there are quite a few here) All four of the main characters are completely believable due to some excellent performances from Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly and the biggest surprise for me in Marlon Wayans. I found myself following each one of their plights very closely throughout the film; relishing in their success when it appeared and rooting for them to somehow pull themselves out of the troubles that they get into. And this is the most impressive thing about the movie, it made me care. It made me watch these four characters as if this were really happpening to each individual. The actors transcended their roles in this one.Equally as good is Aronofsky's pacing and cinematography and the haunting soundtrack that makes this movie come to life. Both do superb jobs of actually making this movie seem more like a documentary of the real life struggles of the characters, which is something that Hollywood often fails to do. Requiem for a Dream is without a doubt one of the better films made in recent memory and is one that more people should have had the pleasure of seeing. Here's to hoping that more movies are made with the passion that this one was seemingly made with.",10,1,2,5 September 2004
