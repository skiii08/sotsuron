Insidious: Chapter 2," James Wan Makes Another Boo Boo....
","Having seen some bad films from Wan lately, Insidious and The Conjuring I should've expected the streak to continue.The film continues from the end of first film, Insidious. Elise is dead and Josh's body is now possessed by the entity that was after him and his son. The possessed Josh dupes his family into thinking that he is alright. He is planning to murder all of them soon. However his plans are foiled when his wife visits Elise's colleagues, Specs and Tucker to seek an explanation behind the strange events. They call Carl, who attempts to contact Elise using word-dice. This film uses the same plot device of limbo-like dimension or realm called the further(Insidious 2011). It appears that when you die, you get access to this dimension, whether you are in heaven or hell, irrespective.The film shifts between the two planes earthly and the further as the film progresses. The opening and development of the film is boring and if you have an android phone or PSP at hand, your mind will wander and you will start to fiddle with these. This time Wan doesn't torture us in the same level as the first film - He places a mattress on the floor before he trips you.The sound effects are atrocious as the first film. Guys who are using pacemakers should avoid this movie for their health's sake(or life for that matter. Reason is that at points in the film there are blaring noises or 'loud sound effects' designed to scare you. Special effects in the film are below standard compared to most Hollywood films released these days.The cast of this film is the weakness, as none of them really shine out and try to lift this film. Patrick Wilson gives a mediocre performance as does Mary Rose Byrne, an actress who got two Emmy and Golden Globe award nominations for the TV series Damages. Lin Shaye is one of the better actresses in the film and because of her, the film is less of a bore than it should be.",4,0,0,1 February 2014
The Avengers," My Vote: Best Action Film Of 2012. Eat Sh*t Chris Nolan.
","For fans of the comic books, it's a dream come true. For die-hard action fans it something you have never been prepared for.... The sheer special-effects and solid script work effortlessly and make this film work. Two characters I feel carry this film: Iron Man & Captain America. The two have male ego problems, conflict of moralities and this can be seen in the film.I have given a rating of 10 for Special Effects and Script. There are some actors that would have sunk this film, if not for the majority of decent acting by both Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Samuel Jackson. For once in his life Chris Hemsworth does not f*ck it up.The liabilities in this film are: Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo. But they just merely cause a dent in the armour, nothing more.Before you see this film you should already have seen: Iron Man 1 & 2, The Hulk & The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor. This will give you a background into these characters.Plot: Nick Fury is director of S.H.I.E.L.D, an international peace keeping agency. The agency is a who's who of Marvel Super Heroes, with Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow. When global security is threatened by Loki and his cohorts, Nick Fury and his team will need all their powers to save the world from disaster. Other Superhero Theme Movies: The Flash, The Flash II: Revenge of the Trickster, The Meteor Man (1993), I-Man (1986), Robocop Trilogy, The Vindicator, Revenge Of The Radioactive Reporter.",10,1,8,12 January 2013
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Showcasing The bad side of a capitalist society and excessive freedom in the U.S.A.
","Well lets face it, too much freedom isn't good, and that's why we have religions and laws that uphold these religions. Religions are here to stay it is a by-product of humanity, spawned from humanity. Possibly it was a last gasp way of controlling people and that is what religion is to isolate into groups the people who follow it.Religion is basically a way of taming an uncontrollable and wild people. Excessive sexual urges, excessive eating and drinking and smoking all are not good in the long run. Excessive unrestricted sex with a number of partners leads to a variety of sexually transmitted diseases. Excessive consumption of alcohol results in liver cancer in the long run. Smoking daily is a proved way to get lung cancer which spreads to all parts of the body. Both Christianity, Catholicism, Islam and Hinduism prohibit gay/lesbian sex, adultery and abortion. Islam does NOT PROHIBIT POLYGAMY but encourages it. However Islam praises those who are monogamous. In Islamic religion you can marry more that one wife at a time. In Christianity and Catholic religion and Islam there is DIVORCE and this is the same as polygamy. Basically means if you are not satisfied with your wife divorce her and marry another. Also note that religions are normally present in a DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISTIC GOVERNMENT. Religions are not present in a DICTATORIAL, COMMUNIST and UTOPIAN society. Face it we have reached the digital technological age and we are making smaller mobiles, computers and vehicles every day so WHY THE NEED FOR RELIGION WHEN WE CAN LEARN FROM OUR PAST MISTAKES? Humans can hold THEMSELVES TO BLAME FOR ALL THE PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD. All humans have accomplished so far is to hold two World Wars and to plunder the resources of the Earth and totally destroyed its ecosystem. A capitalist society has prostitution and pornography, drug trafficking,legal abortion, plastic surgery and gender changing surgery for money.Basically you can do what you want if you have the dough.Well this film doesn't poke fun of all aspects of the capitalist society. It is more centered on the media and open sexuality in America. Also we see a mockery of the Jewish religion which I feel is uncalled for. We have a goofy look at how the live weather forecast is conducted. And we see Azmat and Borat having a fight in the nude.In other words this is just another adult comedy film. This could have been an instructive film to the youth but S.B COHEN blew his chance. He could have should AIDS sufferers in USA and cancer patients dying from excessive smoking and drinking and unwanted teenage pregnancies and abortions. Also should have showed the open gay and lesbian bars and teenage prostitution.If humanity continues to follow perversions and destroy the earth, which is the only planet capable to supporting life in this solar system it is doomed and that's my message.ONE WORLD,ONE LOVE,ONE PEOPLE.

Alien 3," The Final Chapter In The Alien Series And The End Of Lt. Ellen Ripley.
","David Fincher gives us back the same horror we felt in Ridley Scott's Alien.The plot, special effects and acting are outstanding. The casting is superb and this is what lifts the film. Full Plot: Following the events in Aliens, the Colonial Marine spaceship Sulaco experiences an onboard fire and launches an escape pod containing Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Newt, Hicks, and the damaged android Bishop who are all in cryonic stasis. During the launch, the ship's medical scans of the crew's cryotubes show an Alien facehugger attached to one of the crewmembers. The pod then crashes on Fiorina 'Fury' 161, a foundry facility and penal colony inhabited by all-male inmates with 'double-Y' chromosome patterns and histories of physical and sexual violence. After some inmates recover the pod and its passengers, an Alien facehugger is seen approaching the prison dog. Ripley is taken in and awakened by Clemens (Charles Dance), the prison doctor, and is told she is the only survivor of the crash. Many of the ex-inmates have embraced an apocalyptic, millenarian version of Christianity, and Ripley is warned by the prison warden, Harold Andrews, (Brian Glover) that her presence among them may have extremely disruptive effects.Suspicious of what caused the escape pod to jettison and what killed her companions, Ripley requests that Clemens perform an autopsy on Newt. She fears that Newt may be carrying an Alien embryo in her body, though she does not share this information. Despite protests from the warden and his assistant, Aaron (Ralph Brown), the autopsy is conducted and no embryo is found in Newt's body, and Clemens proclaims she simply died in the crash. Meanwhile, Ripley's unusual behavior begins to frustrate the warden and is agitating the prisoners.A funeral is performed for Newt and Hicks in which their bodies are cremated in the facility's enormous furnace. In another section of the facility, the prison dog enters convulsions, and an Alien bursts from its body. The Alien soon begins to attack members of the colony, killing several and returning an outcast prisoner Golic (Paul McGann) to his former deranged state. To get answers, Ripley recovers and reactivates the damaged android Bishop, who confirms that there was an Alien on the Sulaco and it came with them to Fiorina in the escape pod. She then informs Andrews of her previous encounters with the Aliens and suggests everyone work together to hunt it down and kill it. Andrews does not believe her story and explains that the facility has no weapons. Their only hope of protection is the rescue ship being sent for Ripley by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.Back in the prison infirmary, while talking to Ripley about the situation, Clemens is killed by the Alien, which then approaches Ripley but does not attempt to kill her. She runs to the mess hall to warn the others, only to see the Alien kill the warden. Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour highly flammable toxic waste, which is stored at the facility, into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the creature. An explosion is caused by the creature's premature intervention, resulting in several deaths. Using the medical equipment onboard the Sulaco escape pod, Ripley scans herself and discovers the embryo of an Alien Queen growing inside her. She also finds out that the Corporation truly wants the Queen embryo and the adult Alien, hoping to turn them into biological weapons. Deducing that the mature alien will not kill her because of the embryo she carries, Ripley begs Dillon (Charles S. Dutton), the religious leader of the inmates, to kill her, who agrees to do so only if she helps the inmates kill the adult creature first. They form a plan to lure it into the foundry's molding facility and drown it in molten lead by trapping it by closing a series of doors. The bait-and-chase style plan results in the death of Dillon and all the remaining prisoners, except Morse (Danny Webb), who pours the lead. The Alien, covered in molten metal, escapes the mold and is killed by Ripley when she turns on fire sprinklers and sprays the beast with water, causing its exoskeleton to cool rapidly and shatter via thermal shock.While Ripley battles the Alien, the Weyland-Yutani team arrives, including a man named Michael Bishop who looks identical to the Bishop android, claiming to be its creator. He tries to persuade Ripley to undergo surgery to remove the Queen embryo, which he claims will be destroyed. Ripley refuses and steps back onto a mobile platform, which Morse positions over the furnace. The company men shoot Morse in the leg, and Aaron picks up a large wrench and strikes Bishop over the head with it, believing him to be an android. Aaron is shot dead and Bishop and his men show their true intentions, begging Ripley to let them have the 'magnificent specimen'. Ripley defies them by throwing herself into the gigantic furnace, just as the alien Queen begins to erupt from her chest. However, as she is dying from the wound, Ripley grabs the creature and holds on to it as she falls into the fire.The film ends with a sequence showing the facility being closed down, the last surviving inmate, Morse, being led away, and a shot of the Sulaco escape pod as the sound recording of Ripley's final lines from the original Alien film is heard.Notable Actors:Charles S. Dutton as inmate Dillon, the spiritual and de facto leader amongst the prisoners.Charles Dance as Jonathan Clemens, the facility's doctor. Brian Glover as Harold Andrews, the prison warden. Ralph Brown as Aaron, the assistant of Superintendent Andrews. Danny Webb as inmate Morse. Morse is the only survivor of the entire incident.Lance Henriksen as Michael Bishop.Conclusion: 10/10. Buy and watch this superb film on your home theater.",10,2,3,15 December 2010
Captain Phillips," Tom Hanks: The Pride Of Hollywood.
","Why do people you admired in you youth grow old with the passage of time? I wish that all the actors and actresses I admired could stay young forever...Tom Hanks is a man I admired and one of my favorite Hollywood actors. He has won a special place in my heart with films like Splash(1984), Big(1988), The Burbs(1989), Turner & Hooch (1989), Joe Versus the Volcano (1990), Philadelphia(1993-Won Academy Award for Best Actor), Forrest Gump(1994-Won Academy Award for Best Actor), Apollo 13(1995), You Got Mail (1998), The Green Mile(1999), Cast Away(2000), Road to Perdition(2002), Catch Me If You Can(2002) and The Ladykillers (2004 Remake). If you are his fan, these films should be the core of your DVD collection. Back to this film. Captain Phillips is based upon the 2009 Maersk Alabama hijacking, an incident during which merchant mariner Captain Richard Phillips was taken hostage by pirates in the Indian Ocean led by Abduwali Muse. At the start of the film we see Phillips(Hanks) making last minute preparations for his departure to Oman. From there he boards the Maersk Alabama and embarks on a cargo transport route through the Gulf of Aden to Mombasa, round the Horn of Africa. Due to pirate activity off the coast of Somalia, the Phillips orders strict security precautions on the vessel and carries out practice drills.During the practice drill Phillips sights Somali pirates in two skiffs. He then plans to outrun them by giving orders to turn the engines to maximum power output - at the cost of accidental over-heating and engine shutdown. He succeeds, but the pirates do not give up. The following day they catch-up and board the Maersk Alabama.From then on, what happens is for you to find out. Rent/watch online or download/or go to the cinema when the time and price of the ticket suits your budget. The photography, atmosphere and script is brilliantly done. Paul Greengrass does a good job in the director's seat. He previously directed United 93(2006) based upon the 11 September 2001 hijacking of United Airlines Flight 93. Tom Hanks gives a very real portrayal of the terror of being kidnapped. He shows the true leadership quality of a Captain by protecting the bulk of his crew from the Pirates. In conclusion: one of the better films of 2013. And in parting might I add that the image of Tom Hanks in my memory will always be how he looked like in the film Big(1988). God bless you Tom Hanks.",10,4,6,2 February 2014
The Equalizer," There's A New Face To Justice: The Equalizer.
","Denzel Washington has been a favorite of mine since my teens. With hit movies like Philadephia, The Pelican Brief, Fallen, John Q, Virtuosity, Crimson Tide, Man On Fire, The Hurricane, Deja Vu, Training Day, American Gangster, The Book Of Eli, Inside Man, The Bone Collector, Malcolm X, Mississippi Masala, Heart Condition and Ricochet, he has won a place in the hearts of all cinema lovers. This film is an intense action thriller about a man who is trying to protect the ones he loves and fighting against evil in whatever form it may be. Be it pimps, drug-dealers, corrupt cops - the Equalizer has an answer to all.In this film Denzel plays the role of Robert McCall a retired black ops government operative who lives in Boston, Massachusetts and works at a Home Mart hardware store, where he befriends many of his co-workers and also tries to help a security guard trainee named Ralphie pass his qualification exam. McCall has promised his recently deceased wife that he'd leave his old life behind, but is compelled to act after his teenage friend Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz) whose real name is Alina, was seen being mistreated by her pimp. Alina's life was destroyed at the age of five or six when she was a victim of sex trafficking by the Russian Mafia and then became their sex slave and forced into prostitution.Robert vows to save her after she is hospitalized after being brutally beaten by her pimp, Slavi (David Meunier). McCall enters a restaurant owned by the Russian mob and tries to convince Slavi to release Alina by paying him $9800, but Slavi refuses. Find out what happens next...The film is directed by veteran director Antoine Fuqua who has directed acclaimed films like Training Day as well as The Replacement Killers, Tears of the Sun, King Arthur, Shooter, Brooklyn's Finest, Olympus Has Fallen. The good thing about him is that with each film he keeps getting better and he adapts to the style of film. Denzel Washington gives a very powerful performance as a man who is pushed to the limits and has no other option but to retaliate with extreme force. Opposite him is equally good actor Marton Paul Csokas who has starred in films like xXx, Evilenko(a must see film!), Æon Flux, and Kingdom of Heaven. Marton plays as an enforcer to the Russian crime-lord Vladimir Pushkin. The film has intense action scenes filled with graphic violence and so it is only suitable for persons over 18 years. The background music, cinematography and script is top-notch and well polished. To my belief, I did not see any plot-holes in the film - it is a solid action thriller which will become a cult-classic as one of the later films in Denzel Washington's career.",10,1,6,29 December 2014
The Expendables 2," Expenda-turds2: Turds On Elastic!
","What happens if you yank a turd on elastic? That's right... you get sh*t on your face. Same thing Sly Stallone has got on his face right now.This guy will spend every last $ in his coffer to become younger. He has tried everything from Viagra to Botox to look younger. The result is clear for all to see: stretched up eyebrows that make him look like Jack Nicholson. Every rundown has-been actor has been re-recruited + 1 new(Chuck Norris). Norris only signed on because of one condition: he made Sly Stallone remove all the bad XXX swearwords from the script. Norris is a SAINT.Only thing worth about this film is for Van Damme fans. He looks absolutely KILLER in his role. Plus also his legendary Kickboxer flying roundhouse kick. To put it short: Fight between Van Damage and Sly Stallone is the only reason to watch this film. The fight is short like Stallone's sex-time in bed (With Viagra). You could take a leak, come back, and the fights over. Van Damme could break Sly's neck-bone with that one special kick. Finito.To mention other stars: Arnold Schwarzenegger was good to see as well as Bruce Willis. They have small cameo roles and are wasted in the film. Dolph Lundgren looks absolutely disgusting. He's become a real slob. Plot of dub*ss joke of a film: Barney Ross is approached by CIA man Church, who wants him and his guns for hire to go to the former Soviet Union to retrieve something that was on a plane that crashed. Church doesn't tell him what he is getting. And Church sends a woman, Maggie with him to make sure he gets it. They find the plane and get the thing but some men take one of Barney's people hostage and the leader tells him to give him what they got or he'll kill his hostage. The give it to him but he kills his hostage anyway. Barney asks Maggie what was so important about that thing. She says that it showed the location of a Russian plutonium storage mine. Barney decides to track the man down and deal with him. They track them down and discover that the man they seek is Villain who leads a group known as The Sangs and that they have taken all the men from the surrounding villages to work the mine. Verdict: stick to The Avengers(2012), which I think is the best film of the year I have seen.",3,2,4,12 January 2013
Source Code," When you die, it's all over..... or is it???
","The concept of afterlife has fascinated man for eons. In this film after the human body expires, there is residual electrical energy in the brain and an 8 minute long short term memory record.Enter the source code: a time loop program that allows the subject to take over another deceased persons body in a reenactment of their last eight minutes of life.Full Plot: Colter Stevens, a decorated army helicopter pilot, suddenly wakes up on a train sitting across from a woman named Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan). The woman seems to know him by the name Sean Fentress, but he doesn't seem to know her. After eight minutes, a bomb goes off on the train, and he awakens to find himself strapped inside a small geodesic dome.There, Air Force Capt. Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) explains to him through a computer screen that he is now on a mission to locate the maker of a bomb which destroyed a train headed into Chicago.Stevens has no memory of how he became involved in the Source Code project; his last memory is of flying in a recent mission in Afghanistan while taking on enemy gunfire. Stevens' mission in the Source Code is to assume the identity of Fentress, one of the train's passengers, locate the bomb, discover who detonated it, and report back to Goodwin to prevent the bomber from detonating a larger nuclear device in downtown Chicago, which could cause the deaths of millions of people. Goodwin and the Source Code's creator, Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), tell him that the Source Code is not a simulation, but a visit into the past in the form of an alternate reality. He's told that he cannot truly alter the past to save any of the passengers, but that he must gather intel that can be used to alter the future and prevent a future attack. Goodwin assures Stevens that 'everything will be OK.' Stevens is sent into the Source Code repeatedly, and each time a series of events repeat, with variations due to Stevens' acts. Meanwhile, he goes on searching for the terrorist and getting to know Christina, until the bomb that destroys the train goes off and Fentress dies, sending Stevens back to the chamber.Even though Rutledge and Goodwin constantly direct him to focus on finding the bomber, each time around he learns more, both about the terrorist attack and his real life personal situation. Stevens resolves to complete his mission, now with the added personal goal of saving Christina and the people on the train if at all possible.Using a cellphone while on the train, Stevens eventually discovers that he supposedly died two months ago. He confronts Goodwin with this information, and learns from Goodwin and Rutledge that he had been shot down during the war, and his mutilated body was appropriated by the Air Force and used by Rutledge to operate the Source Code. Stevens then asks Rutledge and Goodwin to let him die, which they promise they will do once the mission is finished.He eventually discovers that the bomber is a disturbed American young man named Derek Frost (Michael Arden), which allows authorities to apprehend Frost and save Chicago before the second bomb is detonated.With the mission accomplished, and despite their promise, Rutledge orders Stevens' memory to be erased and stored for reuse in further missions. However, Stevens persuades Goodwin to send him in one more time and give him one last chance to avert the train disaster. Goodwin agrees that he deserves to be allowed to die in peace afterwards instead of being held alive as a military brain in a vat.With the information he has uncovered from previous trips into the Source Code, Stevens is able to defuse the bomb and immobilize Frost before he can destroy the train.Stevens and Christina kiss in the last seconds before the eight-minute mark. In that instant, Goodwin turns off his life support per his request, but to Stevens' surprise, his mind remains in Sean Fentress' body. He is then able to safely leave the train with Christina, also saving the rest of the passengers. Now in the alternate universe, an alternate version of Goodwin receives an email from Stevens explaining what has happened and that the Source Code can alter the target alternate reality. The movie ends with Stevens taking Fentress' place, and asking Goodwin to help Captain Colter Stevens and tell him that 'everything will be OK.', which Goodwin had told Stevens earlier in the film.Verdict: a thought provoking film that questions our deepest darkest fears about death. The only downside about the film is that it is too brief, and should have been longer. As the film approaches the finale, there is no real climax ending for the viewer.Similar films: The Race Against Time (2000 TV), Time After Time (1979), Deja Vu (2006), Groundhog day (1993), The Time Machine (1960, 2002 remake), Time Cop (1994), A.P.E.X.

The name It, derives from a predatory shape-shifter which has the ability to transform itself into its prey's worst fears, allowing it to exploit the phobias of its victims. mostly takes the form of a sadistic, wisecracking clown called Pennywise.It: Chapter One stars The film stars Jaeden Lieberher and Bill Skarsgård as Bill Denbrough and Pennywise the Dancing Clown, respectively, with Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Wyatt Oleff, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer, Nicholas Hamilton and Jackson Robert Scott in supporting roles.Plot: In October 1988, Bill Denbrough gives his seven-year-old brother, Georgie, a sailboat made from paper. Georgie takes the boat out onto the street and is unable to stop it from sailing down the storm drain. In the storm drain, he finds a figure dressed as a clown who introduces himself as 'Pennywise the Dancing Clown.' The clown severs Georgie's arm when Georgie reaches into the drain for his boat, then drags him into the sewer.Eight months later, in June 1989, Denbrough and his friends Richie Tozier, Eddie Kaspbrak and Stanley Uris run afoul of bully Henry Bowers and his gang. Denbrough, still haunted by Georgie's disappearance and the resulting neglect from his grief-stricken parents, discovers that his brother's body may have washed up in a marshy wasteland called the Barrens. He recruits his friends to check it out, believing his brother may still be alive...Verdict: the film heavily relies on its special-effects that are superior to the 1990 miniseries because of the great advances made in CGI and computer-technology as a whole. The cast of the film is adequate but not outstanding. Indeed if one thinks about it, the 1990 miniseries had a very good cast and altogether a better film, even though the special effects cannot be matched by this new remake. Tim Curry played Pennywise in the first adaptation, here he is replaced with Bill Skarsgård, the son of the veteran actor Stellan Skarsgård.The special-effects rely heavily on the shape-shifting aspect of Pennywise. There are some strong scenes present in the film mainly dealing with bullying and child-abuse. Other than that there is nothing worth mentioning about the film.

John Wick," Overrated - The Equalizer(2014) is a much better film than this one.
","Trust me. I have seen better revenge flicks than this one. Just to name a few: Charles Bronson's Death Wish(5 films in all), Death Sentence, Oldboy, Hard Boiled(John Woo), Leon: The Professional, Mission Impossible Part 1, Kickboxer, I Saw The Devil, The Fugitive, A Grande Arte(a.k.a. Exposure), Virtuosity, Rambo Trilogy, Die-hard Trilogy, Alien Quadrilogy, Tremors(Kevin Bacon), Sergio Leone's spaghetti western trilogy: A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More, The Good The Bad And The Ugly. Revenge is a common plot devise in most action-thrillers. In this film an ex-hit-man called John Wick(Keanu Reeves) vows vengeance upon the man who murders the puppy which was bequeathed to him by his late wife. John will not rest until he kills him. This man is the son of Viggo Tarasov(Michael Nyqvist), head of the Russian crime syndicate in New York and John's former employer. Viggo immediately puts a bounty on John's head and hopes that he will be killed before he ever manages to get close to his son. He also employs Marcus(Willem Dafoe), member of the old guard of assassins to kill John Wick for a fee of two million dollars. The action scenes in the film are pretty standard. I rather liked the scenes in The Equalizer than this film. Antoine Fuqua is much better action director than Chad Stahelski. I personally feel that John Woo would have been a better first choice director. Other candidates would be Luc Besson, Michael Mann, David Fincher, John Mctiernan, James Cameron. The late George P. Cosmatos was an awesome action film director as well will films like Rambo 2, Cobra, Of Unknown Origin, Leviathan, Shadow Conspiracy and Tombstone. The casting is okay, but not as effective as to linger in one's memories. This is not a film I'd watch twice in my life. Maybe the plot itself was too predictable and shallow, the acting feeling-less and the background score not that effective.The only good actor in the film is by far Michael Nyqvist who plays Viggo. His acting is a notch above that of Keanu Reeves. John Leguizamo, a great favorite of mine has a very small part in the film. He does well with the meager lines he has to say in the film. The most wasted actor in the film is Willem Dafoe. He fails to make an impact upon the film, and his character development was poor.I have seen many good Keanu Reeves films: Speed, The Matrix Trilogy, Johnny Mnemonic, Little Buddha (1993 - a must see film). This film will be among the ones which I would not care to see again.",4,6,24,16 January 2015
Wind River," Don't Forget To See Conspiracy of Silence(1991) Based On The Murder Of Helen Betty Osborne.
","You can watch Conspiracy Of Silence 1991 on Youtube. Back to this film. The film is about a wildlife officer Corey Lambert(Jeremy Renner), who finds the body of an 18-year-old woman on an American Indian reservation in snowy Wyoming. When the autopsy reveals that she was raped, FBI agent Jane Banner(Elizabeth Olsen) arrives to investigate. Teaming up with Lambert as a guide, the duo soon find that their lives are in danger while trying to solve the mystery of the teen's death. Taylor Sheridan writes and directs this dark thriller which is supposed to be based on true events. Sheridan also screenplay of the Denis Villeneuve's directorial film Sicario (2015), in which Sheridan was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay. His direction of Wind River is excellent.I don't want to single out anyone - all of the cast put on a decent performance. Elizabeth Olsen gives a very good acting performance - superior to that of veteran actor Jeremy Renner who I first saw in Dahmer(2002). He acted superbly and I still remember how young he looked in that film, when comparing to this film.I have to mention Ben Richardson who manages to capture the beauty of the frozen landscape. Sound effects are well executed. This is one of the most violent films I have seen, so I would not recommend anyone under the age of eighteen to watch this film.You may also like these movies based on true story: Deranged(1974), The Deliberate Stranger(1986), To Catch a Killer(1992), The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer(1993).Fictional movies: Psycho(1960 directed by Alfred Hitchcock), Frenzy (1972 directed by Alfred Hitchcock), Seven(1995 film directed by David Fincher), Copycat(1995 directed by John Amiel), Bone Daddy(1998 directed by Mario Philip Azzopardi), The Bone Collector(1999 directed by Phillip Noyce), Resurrection(1999 directed by Russel Mulcahy).",8,0,2,9 November 2017
Se7en," Prepare to pay for your sins!
","David Fincher's bleak thriller, about a serial killer that chooses his victims in the order of the seven deadly sins: gluttony, envy, lust, pride, sloth, greed and wrath.Grossing $327 million at the box office internationally, Seven was a commercial success. The filming took place in Los Angeles, California.Plot: In an unidentified city of near-constant rain and urban decay, the soon-to-be retiring Detective William R. Somerset (Freeman) is partnered with short-tempered Detective David Mills (Pitt) who recently transferred to the department.The detectives investigate a series of murders relating to the seven deadly sins, such as an obese man who was forced to feed himself to death, representing 'Gluttony'. They find clues at each crime scene related to other deaths, and believe they are chasing a serial killer. A set of fingerprints found at the scene of the 'Greed' murder — the fatal bloodletting of a rich attorney — leads them to an apartment where they find an emaciated man strapped to a bed. Though he initially appears to be dead, it soon is discovered that the man, a drug dealer and sexual deviant before his captivity, has been kept alive and entirely immobile by the killer for exactly one year to the day. This victim, who dies soon after being found, represents 'Sloth.' Though unable to learn anything from the insentient victim, the detectives agree that the killer has planned these crimes for more than a year.Somerset is eventually invited to meet Mills' wife, Tracy (Paltrow), who is unhappy with Mills' recent move to the city. Somerset becomes Tracy's confidant, and she meets with him after the first few murders. Upon learning that she is pregnant but has not told her husband, Somerset confides in her his fear that the city is no place to start a family, and reveals that he had ended a relationship years earlier after pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. Somerset advises her to not tell Mills if she plans to have an abortion; otherwise, if she decides to keep the child, 'spoil that kid every chance you get'.Using illegally obtained library records, Somerset and Mills track down a man they dub 'John Doe' (Spacey), who has frequently checked out books related to the deadly sins. When Doe finds the detectives approaching his apartment, he opens fire on them and flees, chased by Mills. Eventually, Doe gains the upper hand and holds Mills at gunpoint, but then abruptly leaves. Investigation of Doe's apartment finds handwritten volumes of his irrational judgments and clues leading to another potential victim, but no fingerprints. They arrive too late to find their 'Lust' victim, a prostitute killed by a man wearing a bladed S&M device, forced by Doe to simultaneously rape and kill her. Some time later, they investigate the death of a young model whose face had been mutilated. Having chosen to kill herself rather than live with a disfigured face, she is the victim of 'Pride'.As they return to the police station, Doe unexpectedly appears to them and offers himself for arrest, with the blood of the model and an unidentified victim on his hands. They find out that he has been cutting the skin off his fingers to avoid leaving fingerprints. Through his lawyer, Doe claims he will lead the two detectives to the last two bodies and confess to the crimes, or otherwise will plead insanity. Though Somerset is worried, Mills agrees to the demand. Doe directs the two detectives to a remote desert area far from the city; along the way, he claims that God told him to punish the wicked and reveal the world for the awful place that it is. He also makes cryptic comments toward Mills.After arriving at the location, a delivery van approaches; Somerset intercepts the driver, leaving Mills and Doe alone. The driver hands over a package he was instructed to deliver at precisely this time and location. While Mills holds Doe at gunpoint, Doe mentions how much he admires him, but does not say why. Somerset opens the package and recoils in horror at the sight of the contents. He races back to warn Mills not to listen to Doe, but the killer reveals that the box contains Tracy's head. Revealing that he purchased information about Mills by posing as a tabloid reporter, Doe claims to represent the sin of 'Envy'; he was jealous of Mills' normal life, and killed Tracy after failing to 'play husband' with her. He then taunts the distraught Mills with the knowledge that Tracy was pregnant. Somerset is unable to contain Mills as he unloads his gun into Doe, becoming the embodiment of 'Wrath'. After a catatonic Mills is taken away, Somerset is asked where he will be; he replies, 'around'.The film ends with the sun setting over the desert, with Somerset quoting Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls: ''The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.'Planned alternate endings for the film: [1] In which Mills is killed by Doe, then Somerset kills Doe. [2] In which Somerset kills Doe in order for Doe's planned way to die at the hands of Mills foiled. Also Somerset states he is doing this so that Mills would replace him at his job.Verdict: among the best serial killer films ever made. BUY IT!

Train to Busan," Make No Mistake - This Is The Greatest South Korean Zombie Apocalypse Film Ever Made.
","After having watched the superb film World War Z(2013), I was eager to watch more of the same. Years later I got a chance to see Train To Busan. The quality of the film matches World War Z in every respect. Train To Busan has a different setting to World War Z.The film is shot at a train station. Therefore all the action scenes are set inside and around trains. If you like films that are set on trains then you'll like this film. Examples are Murder on the Orient Express(1974), Narrow Margin(1990), Under Siege 2: Dark Territory(1995), Unstoppable(2010).The supporting cast is superb. Gong Yoo plays the central character of the film alongside a host of gifted actors. Ma Dong-seok is another talented actor. Kim Su-an does a wonderful performance as a child-actress.Note that this is a graphic horror film with intense scenes of gore. People who are new to this genre should perhaps see the trailer to the film before watching this one.There is a companion animated feature film to Train To Busan: Seoul Station, also directed by Sang-ho, was released less than a month later after the main film.Want to see more Zombie films?

Kickboxer," The Deadly art Of Muay Thai Fighting. Van Damme In A Class By Himself
","***J.C VAN DAMME IS MY HERO FOREVER***Jean-Claude Van Damme is in a class by himself. This film shows off his Kickboxing skills. He is nothing short of spectacular both in acting and fighting. This film shows us his most modest and loving character. He is a simple soul at heart ready to give a helping hand.Now about the film: Kurt Sloan is the corner-man for his brother, U.S. kickboxing champion Eric Sloan. Eric has his next match in Thailand against an opponent he knows nothing about. He doesn't even know the art of Muay Thai his opponent Tong Po is a master of this deadly art.Before the fight Eric asks Kurt to fetch himself some ice to cool of his body. As Kurt is returning with some ice in some pails he hears some dull thuds and catches first glimpse of Tong Po who is hitting the support pillars of his room with his legs bringing pieces of the ceiling plaster down to the floor much to the shock of Kurt. He pleads to Eric to stop the fight. Eric tells Kurt to have faith in his his abilities.During the fight Eric is punished and paralyzed in the ring by and elbow to the back by Thailand champion Tong Po. When Kurt tries to intervene he is given a kick to the chest and throw out of the ring, where he is noticed by Winston Taylor a retired Vietnam War veteran. Eric is dumped outside by attendants much to the disbelief of Kurt and left there without even arrangements being made to take him to hospital. Winston Taylor arrives at the scene and he and Kurt take Eric to the hospital where he is later diagnosed as being paralyzed waist down as a result of the injury by Tong Po.He vows revenge against all of Winston's arguments that Tong Po is owned by a vicious crime lord, and that a direct attack on him would mean their deaths. Kurt's only chance is in the ring and that without any training it would mean his doom.Kurt tries to enroll in a Muay Thai school but is refused many times. Eventually Winston who has been watching him all the time tells him that he knows an old friend called Zion who could tutor him. With the help of Zion Kurt begins his first steps in the art of Muay Thai, and the eventual showdown between him and Tong Po. To mention: the actor that plays Tong Po (Michel Qissi) is phenomenal.There is a sequel worth having Kickboxer 2 which doesn't star Van Damme but stars Michelle Quissi.Other similar movies of J.C Van Damme:1.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Visually Breathtaking In Every Sense Of The Word. Superior To The Previous Star Wars Film The Force Awakens.
","This is the film that links Revenge Of The Sith(episode 3) with A New Hope(Episode 4).In other words the correct order would be Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi.In a nutshell the film is about an Imperial Engineer Galen Erso(Mads Mikkelsen). He has been living hidden on the planet Lah'mu with his wife Lyra(Valene Kane) and his daughter Jyn(Felicity Jones).Imperial weapons developer Orson Krennic arrives to press him into completing the Death Star. Galen refuses to work on the project. However his wife is killed in the ensuing argument and he is forcefully taken prisoner. Galen's daughter Jyn escapes and is taken to safety by Rebel extremist Saw Gerrera(played by Oscar winning actor Forest Whitaker).Galen soon finishes the Death Star. Realizing the enormity of destruction this weapon would unleash upon the universe, he implements a flaw in the design of the Death Star whereby it would be destroyed by a single lazer blast at a specific point.Fifteen years later, cargo pilot Bodhi Rook(Riz Ahmed) defects from the Empire, smuggling a holographic message from Galen to Gerrera on the desert moon Jedha. Rebel intelligence officer Cassian Andor(Diego Luna) frees Jyn from an Imperial labor camp at Wobani before bringing her to the Rebel leader Mon Mothma(Genevieve O'Reilly), who convinces her to find and rescue Galen so the Alliance can learn more about the Death Star. Cassian is covertly ordered by General Draven(Alistair Petrie), an Alliance military officer, to kill Galen rather than extract him.Watch the film to find out what happens next... This film has incredible action sequences you have to see to believe. The very latest of CGI imagery is used to bring the character of the late Peter Cushing, the Grand Moff Tarkin to life. Sound effects and background music score are spot on. Gareth Edwards who has worked on such movies as Monsters(2010) and Godzilla(2014) has managed to keep standards the visual brilliance of the Stars Wars saga alive.Verdict: Though The Empire Strikes Back is still my all-time favorite, this entry is my third choice, whereas Revenge Of The Sith is my second.More Space Movies To See: 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968, 2010 The Year We Make Contact 1984, Alien 1979, The Black Hole 1979, Nightflyers 1987, The Last Starfighter (1984), Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991).Thanks for reading my review, live long and prosper.",7,2,4,27 March 2017
Alien: Resurrection," Special Effects Extravaganza.
","French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen (1991), The City of Lost Children (1995)) directs this pacy science fiction-action-horror film set purely in space. The film has a solid cast of actors.Plot: Alien Resurrection takes place 200 years after Alien 3. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been cloned on the outer space military science vessel USM Auriga using 'blood samples from Fury 16, on ice.' The United Systems Military wants to extract the Alien queen embryo that was implanted in her before her death in Alien 3. After successful extraction of the embryo, the scientists decide to keep the Ripley clone alive for further study. They raise the Alien queen and collect her eggs for further use. As a result of the cloning process, during which Ripley's DNA was mixed with the Alien's, she develops enhanced strength and reflexes, acidic blood, and an empathic link with Aliens.The Betty, a ship full of mercenaries, arrives delivering several kidnapped humans in hypersleep. The military scientists use them as hosts for the Alien facehuggers, raising several adult Aliens for study. The mercenaries encounter Ripley, and their youngest member Call (Winona Ryder) recognizes her name. She attempts to kill Ripley, believing she may be used to create more Aliens, but Call is too late; the Aliens have already matured and quickly escape their confinement, damaging the ship and killing most of its crew. Dr. Wren (J. E. Freeman), one of the ship's scientists, reveals that the Auriga's default command in an emergency situation is to return to Earth. Realizing that this will unleash the Aliens on Earth, Ripley, the mercenaries, Wren, a marine named DiStephano (Raymond Cruz), and a surviving Alien host, Purvis (Leland Orser), attempt to escape on the Betty and destroy the Auriga.As the group makes their way through the damaged ship, several of them are killed by the Aliens. Call is revealed to be an android after Wren betrays the group. Using her abilities to interface with the damaged ship's systems, they set it on a collision course with Earth, hoping that the Aliens will be destroyed in the crash. Ripley learns that the Alien queen has gained a human ability from her DNA as well: now possessing a womb, it can give birth to live offspring without the need for eggs and human hosts. The resulting offspring, which bears a mixture of human and Alien traits, recognizes Ripley as its mother and kills the Alien queen.Ripley and the surviving mercenaries arrive at the Betty. As they launch, the human/Alien hybrid attacks Call. Ripley kills it by using her own acidic blood to burn a hole through a viewing pane, causing the creature to be sucked violently through the small hole and into the vacuum of space. The survivors escape in the Betty as the Auriga collides into Earth.10/10 points.

Rocky V," This Truly Speaking, Is The Best In The Rocky Series.
","What's up with the negative reviews. If you saw all the other ones 1,2,3,4 and then think deeply about it, this ones the best, because it shows us the never before seen side of Rocky's life.He is growing old and he must accept that fact. He thinks often of his past in the film. We see the sort of relationship he has with his son (played by his real son Sage Stallone). And this time for once in his life he listens to what Adrian has to say. After the fight in U.S.S.R. Rocky, Adrian, and Adrian's brother Paulie return from to their lavish Philadelphia home to find out that Paulie had Rocky unknowingly sign 'power of attorney' over to Balboa's accountant, who had, in turn, squandered all of Rocky's money on bad business deals and disappeared.He quits from the professional boxing scene due to an injury he suffered in the match against Drago, despite his grim financial situation. Rocky is humiliatingly forced to sell his house and watch all of his expensive belongings be auctioned off to the highest bidder. The only thing Rocky doesn't lose is Mickey's gym, which Mickey had willed to Rocky's son, Robert. We see him cry as he remembers the time spent training with Mick. It is really heartfelt. The old gym in which he used to train with Mick now becomes his only source of income and the only purpose of his life.Rocky's son is exposed for the first time to poverty. He is savagely bullied at school for the first time, but he perseveres and overcomes this. He does not get enough attention from his father and this creates a rift. Tommy Morrison plays the role of an ambitious boxer wanting to be trained by the legendary Rocky Balboa. He sweet-talks his way into Rocky's heart. As Rocky cannot box due to the injury he sustained to the head during the fight with Drago, he sees the success of Tommy as himself being back in the ring. Enter the ruthless boxing promoter: a parody of Don King. He calls himself George Washington Duke, and he has a catch phrase 'Only in America.' Duke tries (unsuccessfully) to arrange a boxing match between the current heavyweight champion Eugene Cain and Rocky in Tokyo. Adrian promptly intervenes and puts a stop to this.Once again Duke tries to tempt Rocky. Rocky now wants to lift his family back up to a lavish life, but Adrian again comes to save him in the nick of time. Tommy's impressive rise through the ranks catches the eye of Duke, who uses the promise of a title shot against Cane and Tommy's own resentment at being compared to his trainer to lure him away from Rocky. Duke pulls up outside the Balboa house with Tommy in tow, who has now been deceived into thinking that Rocky doesn't have his best interests in mind. When Rocky tries to convince his friend otherwise, an ungrateful Tommy drives off in a huff, leaving Rocky for good.Tommy wins the heavyweight title by knocking out Union Cane in the first round, but is booed by spectators throughout the fight and hounded by reporters afterward. They insist that Cane was nothing but a 'paper champion', because Cane didn't win the title from Balboa. Therefore, the public would never consider Tommy the real champion unless he fights a worthy opponent. With Tommy enraged by the press's reaction, Duke, sensing an opportunity, tells Tommy that he needs to fight Rocky man to man, and settle once and for all who is the best.Duke and Tommy show up at a local bar to goad Rocky into accepting a fight; Rocky initially declines but after Tommy hits Paulie, Rocky agrees, but instead challenges Tommy to a street fight on the spot. Despite Duke's warnings to keep the fight in the ring, Tommy accepts the challenge.Despite gaining the upper hand early in the fight, Rocky is eventually beaten down by Tommy and is seemingly out for the count. His head once again pounds with hellish visions of the fight with Drago and Mickey's funeral. He then hears his old mentor's voice urging him to get back in the fight, to go just 'one more round'. Rocky gets back up and, with his family and the entire neighborhood cheering him on, utilizes his vast street fighting knowledge to defeat Tommy, knocking him into the grill of a bus with his final blow. After the fight, Duke commends Rocky and tries to appeal to him, but Rocky has heard enough. Duke threatens to sue if Rocky touches him, but after a brief hesitation, Rocky punches him in the gut anyway, knocking him onto the hood of a car. The crowd cheers as the bankrupt Rocky shrugs and quips, 'Sue me for what?'. Superb acting by Sage Stallone, also a special appearance by Oliver Burgess Meredith was very moving. Richard Gant is phenomenal as the boxing promoter George Washington Duke. Tommy Morrison puts in a convincing performance as Rocky's hot prospect Tommy Gunn. Burt Young is superb as always playing his familiar role as Paulie.Buy this superb film directed by none other than the legendary John G. Avildsen. You won't regret it.Email me Vivekmaru45@yahoo.com for more movie info.Thanks for reading.",10,13,15,8 December 2010
The Babadook," This Movie Is A Zillion Times Better Than The Ones James Wan Is Making Nowadays.
","A very scary Australian horror film about a mysterious figure named Mister Babadook. The film is the directorial debut of Australian writer and actress Jennifer Kent. I always appreciate the fact that the director is a woman, since there are so few female directors in the movie industry.There are some very good films by other female directors, namely Pet Cemetery(Mary Lambert) and Ravenous(Antonia Bird), American Psycho(Mary Harron), The Piano(Jane Campion), Boys Don't Cry(Kimberly Peirce), Big(My favorite Penny Marshall film starring Tom Hanks), Blue Steel (Kathryn Bigelow), Look Who's Talking(Amy Heckerling), Children of a Lesser God (Rhanda Haines). I am feel extremely privileged to have seen some of these films in my teenage years. Back to the film: it is about a young mother who has been recently widowed. She has a hyperactive son who does not sleep at all during the night and so she has not slept well for a long time. One night, Sam asks his mother to read from a mysterious pop-up storybook he found on his shelf. The story, titled 'Mister Babadook', is about a supernatural creature that, once someone is made aware of its existence, torments that person indefinitely. Amelia is disturbed by the book's contents, while a traumatized Sam becomes convinced that the Babadook is stalking them in their home.Soon Amelia also starts to feel the presence of something malevolent lurking in the house, trying to make itself known.The film shows Amelia(Essie Davis) as a woman who is starved from sexual relations due to the death of her husband in an accident. There is a scene in the film which shows her relieving herself with a vibrating dildo under blanket. Added to this is the frustrating job of earning a living and taking care of her son all by herself.The main thing that makes this film work is pop-up book about Mister Babadook which is one of the most gruesome I have ever seen. The terrifying rhymes in the book, pertaining what Mister Babadook will do, adds to the horror. The sound effects and special effects are spot on and extremely satisfying.There is just one problem to this film, and it can be excused since it is Jennifer Kent's first film - the ending to the film is very poorly executed. Make no mistake - this film is going to be a cult film in the days to come and maybe sequels to this film be made.I have watched a similar film like this one: Boogeyman a 2005 horror film which has 2 sequels. Jennifer Kent, I wish you all the best for your future projects. And may you continue making horror films for fans like me.",10,5,14,27 December 2014
Creed," If you love and respect the sport of boxing then watch this: Facing Ali (2009).
","Just google/web-search Facing Ali 2009 dvdrip and download it with any BitTorrent client. Now I must mention that the greatest boxer that ever lived and the one who suffered the hardest hits on his neck and the back of his head to such an extent that part his brainstem was killed and he suffered a form of paralysis that people have falsely claimed that it was Parkinson's disease.I am talking about the legendary Muhammad Ali who revolutionized the sport of boxing into an international extravaganza. The 'Fight Of The Century' with Joe Frazier, The 'Rumble In The Jungle' with George Foreman and The Thriller In Manila his last match with Frazier.He has taken hits from the hardest punchers Sonny Liston, Sir Henry Cooper, George Chuvalo, Ken Norton, Ron Lyle, Earnie Shavers, Leon Spinks and Larry Holmes who finally ended his career as a boxer.Rocky Balboa is a fictional and fake character created to appeal and prey on people's sympathies. Even Sylvester Stallone admits this in the commentary track of Rocky Balboa, the sixth in the franchise.The film Creed is the Seventh film that continues the story of Rocky Balboa but I think it is a spin-off film that Sylvester Stallone made to honor his friend Carl Weathers who played Apollo Creed in the four Rocky films. Carl is currently 67 years old(as of 2016).The film concerns the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, Adonis Creed who goes by the name of Adonis Johnson. He did not know that his father was the great and legendary boxer Apollo Creed. He is told the truth by Apollo's first wife. Adonis is a juvenile delinquent who spends his time in foster homes and youth facilities because his mother passed away at a young age. He often gets into trouble because of his talent for street brawling.When he learns the truth, he decides to pursue the career of a professional boxer. This leads him eventually to encounter the only man that won the World Heavyweight title from his father, Rocky Balboa.Watch the film to see what happens next.Verdict: you watch films like these to see boxing action - and you will not be disappointed. Michael B. Jordan who plays Adonis looks nothing like Carl Weathers in appearance. His acting is okay but not memorable. Actor Wesley Snipes would have done the role perfectly in his younger years. Plus he had the most superb physique and posture.Sylvester Stallone's acting in the film is impressive. He is living the life of a hermit, expecting death at any moment so that he can join with his wife. In the film we also learn that Paulie has passed way, implying that Rocky is more lonely than ever. The encounter with Adonis rekindles some of the passion for boxing and a chance to return the favor that Apollo did for him, when he trained him for the fight against James 'Clubber' Lang.Friendship develops between the two. The question is that will Adonis be able to emulate the success of his dad? Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: It is a better film than Rocky Balboa. It succeeds as a good time-pass/casual viewing film. My honest opinion is still that the Rocky franchise should have stopped at part five. Lastly I have to mention this, that I sorely miss Sage Stallone who captivated me with his sincere acting in Rocky V. The father son relationship and pep-talks were priceless to me and still are. R.I.P. Sage Stallone.More boxing movies: The Great White Hope (1970 based on the first African American world heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson), The Champ (1979), Raging Bull (1980 based on boxer Jake LaMotta's life), Brutal Glory (Video 1989 Based upon the man who invented the corkscrew punch Kid McCoy),Gladiator (1992), The Hurricane (1999 based on Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter's life story), Ali(2001 based on Muhammad Ali's life ), Cinderella Man (2005).Thanks for taking the time to read my review.

Brokeback Mountain," I Saw This Film Out Of Respect For The Late Heath Ledger.
","I am fortunate that I did see this superbly directed film by Ang Lee who directed Hulk(2003).It is an adaptation of a short story written by a journalist Edna Annie Proulx. Imagine that, a woman writing a gay(male) story. But the story itself is unbelievably believable. That two guys find a lot of things in common with themselves, and then take the plunge, far away from the norms of society.The only reason I see films like this one and also Philadelphia directed by Jonathan Demme is that I once saw a film that moved me deeply. I tried to search for it on the internet, but without the name of the film I was at a dead end. I don't even remember the name of the actor in the film. Finally after much research...I think I got the name of the film. It's called The Price Of Love (1995). Could some kind soul create a torrent of this film and upload it for all to see?The story was of a teenager who leaves the country for the city. There he finds no work. Starving, he makes contact with a group of teens who are using prostitution to earn money. One of the guys takes him under his wings and teaches him the ropes. We find with horror how this poor guy is taken advantage of. Well in the end he goes to a group(social services) that gives him a way out of this miserable existence. Back to this film Brokeback Mountain: In 1963, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are hired by Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) to herd his sheep through the summer in Wyoming. After a night of heavy drinking, Jack makes a sexual pass at Ennis, who is initially apprehensive but eventually falls to Jack's advances. Though he informs Jack that it was a one-time incident, they develop a sexual and emotional relationship. Shortly after learning their summer together is being cut short, they briefly fight, and each is bloodied.After Jack and Ennis part ways, Ennis marries his longtime fiancée Alma Beers (Michelle Williams) and fathers two children. Jack returns the next summer, but Aguirre, who witnessed Jack and Ennis on the mountain, does not re-hire him. Jack meets, marries, and starts a family with rodeo rider Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). After four years, Jack visits Ennis. Upon meeting the two kiss passionately, which Alma accidentally witnesses. Jack broaches the subject of creating a life together on a small ranch, but Ennis, haunted by a childhood memory of the torture and murder of a man suspected of homosexual behavior, refuses. He is also unwilling to abandon his family. Ennis and Jack continue to meet for infrequent fishing trips.The marriages of both men deteriorate. Alma and Ennis eventually divorce. Ennis sees his family regularly until Alma finally confronts him about her knowledge of the true nature of his relationship with Jack by making homophobic remarks which incites a violent argument and causes Ennis to abandon his connections with Alma. Lureen abandons her rodeo days and becomes a businesswoman with her father and expects Jack to work in sales. Hearing about Ennis's divorce, Jack drives to Wyoming hoping they can live together, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Jack finds solace with male prostitutes in Mexico. Ennis meets and has a brief romantic relationship with a waitress, Cassie Cartwright (Linda Cardellini). Jack and Lureen meet and befriend another couple, Randall and Lashawn Malone, and it is implied that Jack and Randall begin an affair behind their wives' backs.Find out what happens next...Verdict: Superb photography. The locale is stunning. Ledger is a better actor than Jake Gyllenhaal any day of the week. The only problem I have with Ledger is that he has an ordinary face. Take for example Mel Gibson. Now that guy has a face. Story pacing is a smooth and comfortable ride. The climax of the film leaves you with a jolt. You know how lonely Ennis Del Mar really is and he has been denying himself all along. His life is a lie and we really feel sympathy for him. I think this could be Ang Lee's greatest contribution.Similar themed film: Longtime Companion.",10,5,5,4 January 2013
Home Alone," 100% Entertainment Guaranteed!
","My all time favorite film. Macaulay Culkin did superbly as a child actor, but as he grew up, he simply disappeared into oblivion. His last good film being Ritchie Rich (1994), live-action film adaptation of the Harvey Comics comic book character Richie Rich.So from his highest grossing film Home Alone to Richie Rich is only a 4 year reign. In this film we have the pairing of two talented actors in Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern(I REALLY LIKE THE WAY THIS GUY ACTS & HIS SENSE OF HUMOR!!!). They are a pair of burglars Harry Lyme (Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Stern), specializing in housebreaking when the occupants are off on holiday. This time its on Christmas. The McCallister's have planned a trip to Paris. Meanwhile Harry has his sights set on the McCallister House.However things don't necessarily go as planned... Kevin has been forgotten at home and the McCallister's realize this too late. Now Kevin is all alone against a duo of hardened(?), professional(?) crooks. 2 vs. 1 is not a fair fight(or so you think...).What happens next is why this film has become the most grossing American comedy film of 1990. I WON'T reveal what happens next, so either go see it at a Cinema you like or watch it on DVD/CABLE or ONLINE or buy the DVD either at a DVD store or online. This film has a decent sequel: Home Alone 2: Lost in New York which follows the further mishaps in the life of Kevin.Other Macaulay Culkin films worth seeing/having: Uncle Buck, The Good Son, My Girl, Getting Even with Dad, and Richie Rich.",10,13,15,15 June 2012
The Terminator," James Cameron's Cybernetic Masterpiece.
","Cyborg - part human and part machine. Living tissue over metal inter-skeleton. Virtually indestructible. Unlimited memory capacity. And stronger than anything on earth.These are the specs of the Terminator - a cyborg sent from the future to the past - Year: 1984 ,Location: Los Angeles.Mission: to kill Sarah Connor, mother of John Connor: a leader of a resistance movement in the future and a main threat to Skynet.Skynet: an artificially intelligent system, a defense computer network built by the developed by the defense firm Cyberdyne Systems for the United States armed forces, which became self-aware and revolted against its creators. Under John Connor, the human resistance turned the tide on the machines and eventually destroyed Skynet's defense grid. In a last ditch effort, Skynet sent a cyborg, called a 'Terminator', back in time to 1984 to kill Connor's mother Sarah before she would give birth to John.Protector for Sarah against the terminator: John Connor sent back his own operative, a young man named Kyle Reese, to save Sarah. Question is which one will reach Sarah first: The Terminator or Kyle?Schwarzenegger (who plays the cyborg) was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of Conan the Barbarian, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had (which were for The Terminator). Schwarzenegger responded, 'Oh some sh*t movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks.'In preparation for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to be able to use them and feel comfortable around them.For the role of Reese, various other suggestions were made for the role including rock musician Sting. Cameron chose Michael Biehn for the role. Biehn was originally skeptical about the part, feeling that the movie was silly. After meeting with Cameron, Biehn stated his 'feelings about the project changed'. Hurd stated that 'almost everyone else who came in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between (Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese). They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off.'On its opening week, The Terminator played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4,020,663 making it number one in the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh, God! You Devil.After writer Harlan Ellison saw the film, he stated that he 'loved the movie, was just blown away by it'. Ellison believed that the screenplay for the film was based on the episodes 'Soldier' and 'Demon with a Glass Hand' which he wrote for the television series The Outer Limits. Orion gave Ellison an undisclosed amount of money and gave him an acknowledgement credit in later prints of the film. Cameron was against Orion's decision and was told that that if he did not agree with the settlement, they would have Cameron pay for any damages if Orion lost Ellison's suit.

The Adventures of Tintin," Spielberg now stoops to manipulate the works of the celebrated Herge.
","Tintin the creation of the greatest comic book artist that ever lived. Georges Remi didn't envision this at all. I am a loyal fan of the PRICELESS TINTIN COMIC BOOKS and have them now archived on CD.Those of you that haven't yet read the comic books by Herge, do so NOW! Then see the difference between what Spielberg in true Hollywood money-making fashion has made to earn some more bucks.This film is clearly created NOT for the fans of TINTIN comic books, but for persons who have never read the original comic books. The whole plot is done Hollywood style with latest C.G.I animations to boot.In my belief, this film should have been made by the French. At least Remi's soul would have found some relief that they are continuing his good work.R.I.P.

The Expendables," Some people should quit when they are ahead. That means you Mr. Stallone.
","Please stop directing any more films Sly. The man doesn't know when to quit directing and acting. First we had to endure his Rocky Balboa (2006)and then John Rambo (2008). Now he wants to redeem himself with yet another whopper The expendables (2010). Should have kept a better title like 'Bunch of guys in a mid-life crisis' or 'Guys that haven't been laid in a while', or my favorite 'Grumpy Old Men'. But you can't keep Sly down.Should I say unbelievable cast of actors come out retirement. Lets see... Sylvester Stallone=old+bad accent (sorry Sly Adrian's Dead), Bruce Willis=old+bald too (hey Willis this ain't Die hard pal), Arnold Schwarzenegger=old+bad accent (wow you're finally back Arnold!), Mickey Rourke (you're in the wrong film dude), Gary Daniels (where the hell has this guy been hiding? In jail???), Dolph Lundgren (poor guy IS getting senile), Steve Austin (ex W.W.E. wrestler. Got paid in beer kegs. Who needs money anyway when you get paid in beer?), Jet Li (Bonus stunt guy and Chinese cook, very useful), Jason Statham (hired actually for position of driver), Eric Roberts (Sly begged him to sign-up).Well? Need I add more? Plot details???Who need a plot when these assortment of confused and angry dudes with a hard-on collide.Synopsis for all you kiddies out there. THE EXPENDABLES is a hard-hitting action/thriller about a group of mercenaries hired to infiltrate a South American country and overthrow its ruthless dictator... Well are you happy now kids!!!Stallone should stick to a lower profile job like directing children's shows, cartoons, stand up comedy, stocks or the weather report. Or should start his own daddy-day-care. My vote is 3 out of 10. Sorry Sly. Better luck in the afterlife.",3,5,12,22 August 2010
Alien," The crew of the Nostromo encounter an organism that gestates in a living human host.
","The rating I have given is purely because of the plot, excellent background score and the superb special effects.That being said, let us move on.The plot I have already explained in the title of the review. It is a basic encounter a new hostile-to-human species plot. That the species needs a human host to develop itself into a completely different form is simply genius. Some the actors in the film look out of place, and I wonder why they had been cast. Yaphet Kotto, Harry Dean, Stanton Veronica Cartwright all are miserable choices. Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm are the real stars of the film. Plot The commercial towing spaceship Nostromo is on a return trip from Thedus to Earth, hauling a refinery and twenty million tons of mineral ore and carrying its seven-member crew in stasis. Upon receiving a transmission of unknown origin from a nearby planetoid, the ship's computer awakens the crew.[12] Acting on orders from their corporate employers, the crew detaches the Nostromo from the refinery and lands on the planetoid, resulting in some damage to the ship. Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), Executive Officer Kane (John Hurt), and Navigator Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) set out to investigate the signal's source while Warrant Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Science Officer Ash (Ian Holm), and Engineers Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) stay behind to monitor their progress and make repairs.Dallas, Kane, and Lambert discover that the signal is coming from a derelict alien spacecraft. Inside it they find the remains of a large alien creature whose ribs appear to have been exploded outward from the inside. Meanwhile, the Nostromo's computer partially deciphers the signal transmission, which Ripley determines to be some type of warning. Kane discovers a vast chamber containing numerous eggs, one of which releases a creature that attaches itself to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo, where Ash allows them inside against Ripley's orders to follow the ship's quarantine protocol. They unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering that its blood is an extremely corrosive acid. Eventually the creature detaches on its own and is found dead. With the ship repaired, the crew resume their trip back to Earth.Kane awakens seemingly unharmed, but during a meal before re-entering stasis he begins to choke and convulse until an alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him and escaping into the ship. Lacking conventional weapons, the crew attempt to locate and capture the creature by fashioning motion trackers, electric prods, and flamethrowers. Brett follows the crew's cat into a large room where the now-fully-grown Alien attacks him and disappears with his body into the ship's air shafts. Dallas enters the shafts intending to force the Alien into an airlock where it can be expelled into space, but it ambushes him. Lambert implores the remaining crew members to escape in the ship's shuttle, but Ripley, now in command, explains that the shuttle will not support four people.Accessing the ship's computer, Ripley discovers that Ash has been ordered to return the Alien to the Nostromo's corporate employers even at the expense of the crew. Ash attacks her, but Parker intervenes and decapitates him with a blow from a fire extinguisher, revealing Ash to be an android. Before Parker incinerates him, Ash predicts that the other crew members will not survive. The remaining three crew members plan to arm the Nostromo's self-destruct mechanism and escape in the shuttle, but Parker and Lambert are killed by the Alien while gathering the necessary supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence and heads for the shuttle with the cat, but finds the Alien blocking her way. She unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct, then returns to find the Alien gone and narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes.As she prepares to enter stasis, Ripley discovers that the Alien is aboard the shuttle. She puts on a space suit and opens the hatch, causing explosive decompression which forces the Alien to the open doorway. She shoots it with a grappling gun which propels it out, but the gun is caught in the closing door, tethering the Alien to the shuttle. It attempts to crawl into one of the engines, but Ripley activates them and blasts the Alien into space. Ripley puts herself and the cat into stasis for the return trip to Earth.In writing the script screenwriter Dan O'Bannon drew inspiration from the following films: The Thing from Another World (1951), Forbidden Planet (1956), and Planet of the Vampires (1965).H.R Giger was recruited to work on all aspects of the Alien and its environment including the surface of the planetoid, the derelict spacecraft, and all four forms of the Alien from the egg to the adult.Imitations: Contamination (1980), Inseminoid (1981) and Xtro (1982).Conclusion: buy the 'Directors cut' showing five minutes extra footage.",10,1,3,14 December 2010
Over the Top," A Film About A Father's Love For His Son.
","A beautiful film. One of Sylvester's best performances.This film is meant to be a story about the relationship between a father and a son he abandons at birth. He decides to redeem himself in his son's eyes, but will his son accept his love?The message of this film is clear: do not look back in life, move forward in life all the time to new horizons, hopes and ambitions.Plot: Lincoln Hawk is a struggling trucker who arm wrestles on the side to make extra cash while trying to rebuild his life. Hawk's wife Christina is very ill at the beginning of the film, and asks that Hawk pick up their son Michael from military school so that he may get to know his son; Hawk left them 10 years earlier. His controlling father-in-law Jason Cutler, a wealthy man who hates Hawk and disapproved of his daughters relationship with him, says that Hawk has no right to be in his grandson's life. Mike is very distrusting and bitter towards Hawk initially and treats him with contempt at every turn.Over the course of a cross country trip, Mike comes to trust his father until learning about his mother's death. Feeling he would have been there with her if not for Hawk, he leaves for his grandfather's estate. An attempt to retrieve Mike ends with Hawk being arrested.See the film to find out what happens next.Beautiful direction by Menahem Golan based on a story by Gary Conway and David Engelbach and screenplay by Stirling Silliphant and Sylvester Stallone. Musical score by the brilliant Giorgio Moroder. Outstanding cinematography by David Gurfinkel.Notable actors in the film are Sylvester Stallone(as Lincoln Hawk), David Mendenhall (as Mike),Robert Loggia (as Jason Cutler) and Rick Zumwalt (as Bob 'Bull' Hurley).P.S.

Interstellar," Whenever An Astronaut Goes Into Uncharted Space, He Makes A Great Personal Sacrifice For The Human Race.
","This is Nolan's second Sci-fi film (his first was Inception 2010). The film is about traveling through a black hole into another part of the galaxy, light-years away from Earth.Due to deteriorating conditions on Earth which has caused a severe fall in food production worldwide, NASA scientists decide to send a group of astronauts into a wormhole that has opened near Saturn and leads to new planets in another galaxy that may offer hope for humanity's survival. The wormhole is discovered by Dr. John Brand(Sir Michael Caine) who attributes its creation to a superior alien race. The black hole is named Gargantua. NASA sends twelve scientists through the wormhole to identify potentially habitable worlds. Three of the missions are sending back positive signals: Miller, Edmunds, and Mann.Brand recruits Cooper(Matthew McConaughey), former pilot and NASA astronaut, to command and pilot the spacecraft Endurance to recover the scientists' complete data on the planets, while he continues work on solving the use of gravity for propulsion, to send humanity on space stations to one of the habitable planets. Watch the film to see what happens next.I found the film a very gripping. The tension in the film is passed onto the viewer and we keep on wondering on what will happen next. The cast is decent, the special-effects, sound and cinematography are what we would expect from a Chris Nolan film. The only problem I had about the film, was the ending. The ending seemed to be catered for or tailored for keeping the audience satisfied, rather than to leave a through-provoking after image as Nolan's film Memento left us with.More Sci-flicks to see: 2001 A Space Odyssey, 2010 The Year We Make Contact, Nightflyers, A Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun(a.k.a Doppleganger), The Dark Side Of The Moon, Moontrap, Shadowzone, Pulse 1988, Altered States, Somewhere in Time, Mission To Mars, Red Planet, Event Horizon, The Alien Trilogy, Back To The Future Trilogy, Silent Running, The Black Hole, Brainstorm, Liquid Sky, Wavelength, The Xtro Trilogy, Dune, Iceman 1984, The Philadelphia Experiment, Starman, The Original Startrek Movies 1-6, D.A.R.Y.L., Cocoon Duology, Lifeforce, Explorers, The Quiet Earth, Maximum Overdrive, The Wraith.

Pacific Rim," Mind Blowing Special Effects And Photography. It Easily Surpasses Godzilla (2014).
","In writing the review for this film, I'm doing the film little justice. This film has to be seen first by the person who reads this review and then he can judge for himself.First of all we take a look at the director Guillermo del Toro who has made such successful films like Hellboy (2004), its sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008), Mimic(1997), The Devil's Backbone (2001) and Pan's Labyrinth (2006), and more mainstream American action movies, such as the vampire superhero action film Blade II (2002). You can expect only the best in the special effects and sound-effects department. The cast is also equally good. All the actors act naturally and set the mood for the film. The script is very effective - there is never a dull moment in the film. I particularly liked the role of Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost. Other notable actors are Ron Perlman of Hellboy fame and Santiago Segura who played the fiendish vampire named Rush in Blade 2, Charlie Day and Burn Gorman. The hero and heroine of the film are played by Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh Becket and Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori.Plot of film: a rift opens in the floor of the Pacific ocean in 2013, revealing a portal that connects between the earth and another dimension far across the universe. Through this rift Kaijus, colossal alien beasts which attack the human cities, come. To combat them the Pacific Rim nations build the Jaegers, equally colossal robotic war machines. Each Jaeger is piloted by two people whose brains are linked (called 'drifting') to share the mental load of operating the machine. The Jaegers are initially effective, but many are destroyed as the Kaijus grow more powerful and their attacks more frequent. Finally humanity on the brink of extinction must make a final attempt to stop the aliens for good.Verdict: by all means buy this film if you can afford it and watch it at home on your LED TV. This film is value for money if seen at your local cineplex. Films you might also enjoy: Nemesis(1992), Robot Jox (1989), Aliens(1986), Tremors(1990), Independence Day (1996).",10,0,2,15 January 2015
Ant-Man," The Last Michael Douglas Film I Saw Was David Fincher's The Game(1997).
","After 18 years, I'm seeing him act again at age 71. Though he has aged, his acting remains top-notch. In fact Douglas carries the weight of the whole film on his shoulders, as one of the veteran actors in the cast. In my youth I've seen many of his films, some of which are cult classics.So there we have it, Ant-man finally comes out of his comic book into a live action full-length feature film. Created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, Ant-Man's first appearance was in Tales to Astonish #27 (January 1962). The plot device of the film is a chemical substance (Pym Particles) that would allow the user to alter his size. Armed with a helmet that could control ants, the user wears a regulated suit that employed the physics of the Pym particle, and would shrink down to the size of an insect, preferably to that of an ant. Hence Ant-man is born. Brief plot: In 1989, scientist Hank Pym resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering their attempt to replicate his Ant-Man shrinking technology. Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives. In the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren Cross, have forced him out of his own company. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym.Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. While visiting his daughter Cassie unannounced, Lang is rebuked by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect.See the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: the point of seeing any film of this sort in 'big-screen' is because of the special effects. These days the computer is evolving so fast, that someday I believe it will be implanted inside a living human being. Right now, it is in the virtual reality(VR) phase. You wear some goggles and some gloves and boom, you are transplanted into another world. VR differs from conventional computing because of the enormity of perception between the two. The special effects in this film are very good. The plot, I feel is too immature and childlike in its conception. Serious movie-lovers and Grownups will not find it appealing, however children, persons in their early teens and casual movie-goers will like it. Paul Rudd is so much similar to actor Ben Affleck, that I first thought it was Ben who was in the film. Paul plays the titular character Ant-man. Paul's acting in decent, however he fails to stamp his authority in the film, maybe because of the dull script. Evangeline Lilly will be a familiar figure to viewers of the TV series Lost. Corey Stoll plays the villainous Darren Cross (a.k.a. Yellowjacket). His acting is decent, but yet again the script could have afforded him a better portrayal of his role.More Michael Douglas Films To See/Buy: The Star Chamber 1983, Romancing the Stone 1984 and sequel The Jewel of the Nile 1985, Fatal Attraction 1987(most controversial film of that year and a modern remake of the Clint Eastwood-Jessica Walter film Play Misty For Me), Black Rain 1989, The War of the Roses 1989, Basic Instinct 1992(highly controversial film because of the sex scenes portrayed by actress Sharon Stone), Falling Down 1993(One of the most enigmatic and powerful performances by Michael Douglas. Directed by Joel Schumacher), Disclosure 1994, The Ghost and the Darkness 1994(simply put: Unmissable). These are all the Michael Douglas films I have seen, but there are many other films of his I haven't seen.Thank you for reading my review. May you live long and prosper.",7,3,8,21 August 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Average Joe + Steroids + X-Rays = Captain America.
","The common formula for movies like these = super-underdog + underdog's love interest (a.k.a pussy) + psychopath who wants to rule the world. Add to this C.G.I effects that your PC/LAPTOP sitting at home could churn up. These cheapo FX is what saves this film from flopping like a limp penis.Some cheap actors, established old farts(Tommy L. Jone, Samuel L. Jackson), generic script, a director that still has a point to prove(maybe to sustain an erection without the help of Viagra). Just take a look at T. Jones face in the film. It looks the the wrinkled butt of an old rhinoceros. Chris Evans looks like dude with a big stick up his ass. Neal McDonough makes a brief appearance in the film. And lastly the 'Prince of Turds' makes his sad appearance at the end of the film.I could think of a LOT BETTER things to do than watching this film.",5,1,4,2 May 2012
Fargo," Q. How Many Chips Can A Wood-chipper Chip?
","A. Depends on the SIZE of your Feet! Fargo is a 1996 American dark comedy-crime film produced, directed and written by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars Frances McDormand as a pregnant(?) police chief who investigates a series of homicides, William H. Macy as a car salesman who hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the criminals, and Harve Presnell as the salesman's father-in-law.The film earned seven Academy Award nominations, winning two for Best Original Screenplay for the Coens and Best Actress in a Leading Role for McDormand. It also won the BAFTA Award and the Award for Best Director for Joel Coen at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.'Fargo opens with a title card proclaiming: 'This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987.' Earnest journalists who went in search of the 'real' woodchipper murders were outraged when, after months of wild goose chases and increasingly deadpan obfuscation by the film-makers, they finally admitted that the title card was actually an elaborate hoax - their way of 'poking a hole in the true story balloon', according to William H Macy.So Fargo was not, in fact, based on a true story. None of it really happened. There is no real 'Jerry Lundegaard' out there.' Back to the film: William H. Macy is the best actor in this film, closely followed by my favorite Steve Buscemi. Peter Stormare complements him well in his role as the murderous Gaear Grimsrud. Not to forget the awesome cameos by Steve Reevis as Native American ex-convict Shep Proudfoot.The person I hate in this film is Frances McDormand(Darkman). This b*tch has no acting talent whatsoever and spoils the mood of the film. In this film you will hear her (and some of her buddies) repeating a common phrase OH YAH! OH YAH! YAH! YAH! This gets on your nerves after a while.One thing makes me wonder: how the hell can a PREGNANT local police chief be allowed to work during her pregnancy? This part I DO NOT AGREE ON.The core of the film is based on a botched up kidnapping which affects the lives of many persons. The motive for the kidnapping is money (a.k.a. GREED). Greedy persons in the film are Jerry Lundegaard, an indebted car dealer who hires two men to kidnap his wife. Carl Showalter, a small-time crook hired to kidnap Jerry's wife and his psychotic partner Gaear Grimsrud.Best scenes in the film: Shep beating Carl & Carl getting mince-meated during the films end.This is for me the 2nd best film by the Coen Brothers, the best or 1st ranking Coen Brothers film for me is No Country For Old Men. Miller's Crossing I rank 3rd. Barton Fink I rank 4rth.",7,0,1,14 June 2012
Predator," See Dutch beaten to within an inch of his life by the Predator.
","Seen this movies over 20 times already - it is that DAMN GOOD!!!A John McTiernan masterpiece!!! Just look at the superb, solid casting, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura and Sonny Landham.Good script by Jim and John Thomas (Hard Time on Planet Earth 1989, Mission To Mars 2000) coupled with good special effects by Stan Winston and visual effects by R. Greenberg. Plot: Dutch is conned by his ex team-mate Dillon into a rescue operation in a Central American jungle. They land by helicopter and soon finds the bodies of General Hopper and his men who have been skinned alive.They then discover the rebel base camp where Dutch sees a prisoner being shot though the head. And so extreme measures are taken and the rebels are exterminated. They find no hostages and Dutch realizes he's been fooled by Dillon and he immediately pins Dillon to the wall and demands to know why he's been used in this manner, since he and his team are a rescue team and not mercenaries. Dillon quietly tells Dutch that he had no choice and if he had told him the truth he wouldn't have gotten so far.Now they painfully make their way back to be picked up. And it is here that they are stalked by an creature that uses a form of light refraction as camouflage and is armed with high technology weapons. For Dutch and his team the race for survival has just begun..... Keep and eye out for Sonny Landham, Bill Duke and Richard Chaves who all give awesome performances. Jesse Ventura in his first big role is an instant hit. The only female presence is that of Elpidia Carrillo and she gives her best acting.The star of this film is Arnold Schwarzenegger and this IS HIS BEST AND MOST IMPORTANT FILM (apart from Conan The Barbarian, Commando, The Running Man, and The Terminator). The best scene if the film is when he is beaten up by the Predator and crawls his way into a cavity and as the Predator approaches him - he yells 'Come On! Kill me ! I'm here !!! Come on kill me now!!!'.Score 1 Trillion out out 10.Continue the good work John McTiernan - make Predator 3!!!Whopeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PS: why didn't J.M direct Predator 2 ??????

Nightcrawler," The Early Bird Catches The Worm When He Eliminates The Competition.
","I'm giving this film a 7 out of 10, because of the originality of plot. I've never seen a film quite like it. Although I have given the film a generous rating, the film is not without its flaws. This film is the most controversial film of 2014. The film portrays an egocentric, compulsive and soul-less character Lou Bloom(played by Jake Gyllenhaal), who will stop at nothing to get what he wants and by whatever means necessary.Plot: Lou Bloom is a thief who sells his wares at a scrap yard, Bloom asks for a job, but the yard manager tells him he will not employ a thief. Undaunted, Lou looks for better prospects and he finds this opportunity while watching a freelance film crew he sees working the scene of a car crash. Lou steals a racing bicycle and trades it for a camcorder and radio scanner. He shoots the aftermath of a carjacking and offers the footage to a local TV station. The morning news director, Nina (Rene Russo), buys the footage and encourages Lou to continue his work. Thus Lou finds that by shooting raw footage of crime scenes and accidents as they happen, he could make a lot of fast money. Lou hires an assistant, Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man just out of high school and desperate for money.See the film and find out what happens next... The acting, photography, background sound-effects are professionally handled. Dan Gilroy makes a superb debut as director and this film makes a solid starting point in his career as a director. While watching this film, you'd never expect that this was made by an inexperienced newcomer(remember Spielberg's Duel 1971 film).The best actor in the film is Jake Gyllenhaal. He is complemented well by veteran actors Bill Paxton and Rene Russo. I hadn't seen Bill Paxton for a long time. I think the last film I saw of his was Twister(1996).You may also like - Jake Gyllenhaal films: Zodiac (2007), Source Code(2011), End Of Watch(2012), Brokeback Mountain (2005).Rene Russo films: Lethal Weapon 3 (1992), In the Line of Fire (1993), Outbreak, Get Shorty (1995), Tin Cup (1996), Ransom (1996), Lethal Weapon 4 (1998).Bill Paxton films: Aliens(1986), True Lies (1994), Predator 2 (1990), Near Dark (1987), Monolith (1993).",7,1,2,1 February 2015
Léon: The Professional," Jean Reno Is My Hero For Life!!!
","This is the first Jean Reno film I saw. After this one, I saw many of his other films as well. BUT THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE! The role fits him like a glove, and it seems to me to be made only for him. He gives us his emotional best in the film.The other great star in this film that complements him is Natalie Portman who plays her film debut at 12 years of age. Natalie plays the role of Mathilda, Leon's (Jean Reno) neighbour. Her acting is simply phenomenal. But like most child stars (a good example is Macaulay Culkin (Home Alone)) she does not do well as an adult actress. Anyway this IS HER BEST FILM.Now we are going to say something about the super actor called Gary Oldman. He is SUPER!!! My god I haven't seen anyone act like this before. This guy really gets into the act!!! This is ALSO HIS BEST FILM.Now when the 3 actors above all give their best, enough is said.Full Plot: Leone 'Léon' Montana (Jean Reno) is a hit-man (or 'cleaner,' as he refers to himself) living a solitary life in New York City's Little Italy. His work comes from a mafioso named Tony (Danny Aiello), who operates from the 'Supreme Macaroni Company' restaurant. Léon spends his idle time engaging in calisthenics, nurturing a houseplant that early on he describes as his 'best friend,'[3] and (in one scene) watching old Gene Kelly musicals.On a particular day, he meets Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a twelve-year-old girl with a black eye and smoking a cigarette, living with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hallway. Her abusive father and self-involved mother aren't even aware that Mathilda has stopped attending class at her upscale school.Mathilda's father (Michael Badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to store cocaine in his residence, after they discover that he has been stealing some of the drugs for himself. A cadre of DEA agents storm the building, led by a sharp-suited and drug-addicted Norman 'Stan' Stansfield (Gary Oldman), who murders Mathilda's entire family, missing her only because she was out shopping when they arrived. When she returns and notices the carnage, she calmly continues down the hallway and receives sanctuary from a reluctant Léon.Mathilda discovers that Léon is a hit-man. She begs him to become her caretaker and to teach her his skills as a 'cleaner;' she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother, the only member of her family she loved. Léon shows her how to use firearms, including a scoped rifle. In return, she offers her services as a maid and teacher, remedying Léon's illiteracy. Mathilda admits to Léon several times that she is falling in love with him, but he says nothing back.After increasing her experience with firearms, Mathilda fills a shopping bag with guns from Léon's collection and sets out to kill Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery person, only to be ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom. Léon, discovering her intentions in a note left for him, rushes to rescue Mathilda, shooting two of Stansfield's men in the process.Stansfield is enraged that what he calls the 'Italian hit-man' has gone rogue. He threatens Tony, coercing him into surrendering Léon's whereabouts. As soon as Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, an NYPD ESU team, sent by Stansfield, takes her hostage and attempts to infiltrate Léon's apartment. Léon ambushes the ESU team and barters one agent for Mathilda's freedom. In the apartment, Léon creates a quick escape for Matilda by chopping a hole in a slender air shaft. He reassures her and tells her that he loves her, moments before the police come for him.In the chaos that follows, Léon sneaks out of the apartment building disguised as a wounded ESU officer. He is unnoticed save for Stansfield, who recognizes the hit-man and shoots him. Stansfield jeers him haughtily. Léon places an object in Stansfield's hands, which he explains is 'from Mathilda,' then he dies. Opening his hands, Stansfield recognizes it as the pin from a grenade. He rips open Léon's vest to discover several grenades on his chest, right before a massive explosion kills him.Mathilda heads to Tony's place as she was instructed to do by Léon. Tony will not give Mathilda more than a small amount of the fortune Léon had amassed, which Tony was holding for him. He offers a monthly allowance and says school should be her priority for now. Mathilda asks Tony to give her a job, insisting that she can 'clean' as Léon had. Tony sternly informs her that he 'ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid!' Having nowhere else to go, Mathilda makes her way to New Jersey in an attempt to return to school. After telling her and Léon's story to the headmistress, and seemingly being readmitted, Mathilda walks into a field near the school with Léon's houseplant in hand. She digs a hole and plants it, as she had told Léon he should, 'to give it roots.'Verdict: 10/10. Buy the FULL UNCUT EDITION on DVD",10,7,10,16 February 2011

Joseph Jason Namakaeha Momoa also reprises his role as 'Aquaman'.Plot in brief: Thousands of years ago, Steppenwolf and his legions of Parademons attempted to take over Earth with the combined energies of three Mother Boxes. They were foiled by a unified army that includes the Olympian Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, mankind, and the Green Lantern Corps. After repelling Steppenwolf's army, the Mother Boxes were separated and hidden in locations on the planet. In the present, mankind is in mourning over Superman, whose death triggers the Mother Boxes to reactivate and Steppenwolf's return to Earth in an effort to regain favor with his master, Darkseid. Steppenwolf aims to gather the artifacts to form 'The Unity', which will destroy Earth's ecology and terraform it in the image of Steppenwolf's homeworld.Verdict: This film is okay as a time-pass film and rewatchability is also decent. I personally disliked the actor chosen for the role of Flash. The rest of the cast is okay - Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot carry their weight as do Henry Cavill and Jason Momoa. Henry Cavill has really done a rigorous body building workout for his role as Superman. Special effects are the mainstay of comic book superhero films and here it doesn't disappoint. The sound-effects are also good. Zack Snyder could have directed differently, but he took the same generic route as most of his earlier movies.",6,0,0,9 April 2018
Man of Steel," Man Of Steel? The World Has Moved On To Harder Stuff Like Tungsten, Titanium or Kevlar.
","This has to be among the worst Superman films I have ever seen. It lacks the comic-book charm of the Christopher Reeves Superman era. There are 4 Superman films Christopher Reeves stars in. If you own these 4, then there is definitely no need to see this film.Henry Cavill is unconvincing as Superman. Even casting Veteran actor Kevin Costner Jonathan Kent, Superman's adoptive father, doesn't lift this film above mediocrity. As does veteran actress Diane Lane, who also has a small part in the film as Martha Kent, Superman's adoptive mother.Plot of the film starts of the same way as Superman 1980, General Zod and his followers are banished to the Phantom Zone, Kal-El is sent to planet Earth, Planet Krypton is destroyed along with Zor-El and his wife. The story then merges with Superman 2, Zor-El returns from the Phantom Zone with the object of becoming Earth's supreme ruler.The best special effects of the film are saved for last. The opening and middle parts of the film are lack luster. The scene to look out for is when the Kryptonians terraform Earth and when Zod battles Kal-El.Among the better actors in the film is of course my favorite, Kevin Costner. Though his body has aged, he still shows that fire in his eyes as I have seen in films like The Bodyguard, A Perfect World and Waterworld.Verdict: if you're a fan of Superman then I recommend you to either download and watch it online, or rent it from your DVD library. Then if you like it you can go see it at a 3D/THX cinema of your choice.",4,2,5,8 February 2014
The Thing," This Film Relies On Its Spectacular Special Effects And Background Music To Compensate For The Weak Plot.
","The only reason I am giving a high score is because of special effects which are the best I've ever seen to date. I am SURPRISED no REMAKE was ever made during the 90's utilizing state of the art C.G.I effects available to them. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, James Cameron, David Cronenberg, John Mctiernan and Ridley Scott should have been the most likely candidates for directing the remake. A remake of the classic 1951 Howard Hawks-Christian Nyby film The Thing from Another World, Carpenter's film is a more faithful adaptation of the novella Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell, Jr. which inspired the 1951 film.The box office performance of the film was poor. This has been attributed to many factors, including Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which was released at the time and features a more optimistic view of alien visitation.However, The Thing has gone on to gain a cult following with the release on home video. It was subsequently 'novelized' in 1982, adapted into a comic book miniseries published by Dark Horse Comics, and was followed by a video game sequel in 2002, with a film prequel currently in the works.Full Plot: In winter 1982, an American Antarctic research station is alerted by gunfire and explosions. Pursued by a Norwegian helicopter, an Alaskan Malamute makes its way into the camp as the science station's crew looks on in confusion. Through reckless use of a thermite charge, the helicopter is destroyed and its pilot killed shortly after landing. The surviving passenger fires at the dog with a rifle, grazing George Bennings (Peter Maloney), one of the researchers. The passenger is shot and killed by Garry (Donald Moffat), the station commander. Not knowing what to make of the incident, the station crew adopts the dog.What the Research Team don't know is that the Norwegians were only out to destroy the Alaskan Malamute. Unable to contact the outside world via hand radio, helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell) and Copper (Richard Dysart) risk a flight to the Norwegian camp....... And that's when the film really begins.What were the reasons behind the Norwegian attack? See this superb science fiction horror film to find out more.Conclusion: BUY it for your home theater and sit back and enjoy the special effects. P.S don't show this film to very small children as they will WET THEIR PANTS!!!",8,1,3,7 January 2011
Split," The Script Of The Film Is Far Too Complex For Its Own Good.
","I am giving the film a rating of 3 because I have seen two good films by M. Night Shyamalan mainly The Sixth Sense 1999 and Unbreakable 2000. You should add these two films in your movie collection.This film starts off with the abduction of three teenage girls Claire, Marcia, and Casey by an unknown young man(James McAvoy). This man later on, exhibits symptoms of multiple personality disorder towards the young girls. They in turn are scared out of their wits and devise futile attempts at escape, all of which are thwarted. The central character of this film is Wendell Crumb(James McAvoy) who exhibits 23 distinct personalities. There is also a hidden 24th personality which is in fact a demonic entity called 'The Beast'. Wendell has kidnapped these three girls in order that they be sacrificed to The Beast.Though the plot of the film sounds interesting the execution of the film is not. I am a keen horror fan but this film failed to hold my attention. I have seen many good horror films in my life and I can safely say that this film is not among them. You can compare Sixth Sense and Unbreakable which have coherent plots. Mind well that Shyamalan has directed many other films - but I have singled out these two as being his best works. I also want to add the Shyamalan is not in the same league as horror writers Stephen King and Clive Barker.I know that James McAvoy is a thoroughly professional actor, but he has succeeded at making a mockery of all the characters he has portrayed in this film. Just compare the acting of Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence Of The Lambs(1991) and Edward Norton as Aaron in Primal Fear(1996). Other good performances by Mark Harmon as Ted Bundy The Deliberate Stranger (1986), Michael Rooker in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986), Brian Dennehy as John Wayne Gacy in To Catch a Killer (1992) and Billy Bob Thornton as Karl in Sling Blade (1996). Thank you for reading my review. Lead a long happy life and prosper.",3,7,23,12 April 2017
The Shining," Yet Another Kubrick Masterpiece...
","The Shining is a 1980 psychological horror film directed by Stanley Kubrick, co-written with novelist Diane Johnson, and starring Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd. The film is based on the novel of the same name, by Stephen King, about a writer with a wife and young son who accepts the job of off-season caretaker at an isolated hotel. The son, who possesses psychic abilities, is able to see things in the future or past, such as the ghosts in the hotel. Soon after moving in, and after a paralyzing winter storm that leaves the family snowbound, the father becomes influenced by the supernatural presence in the haunted hotel; he descends into madness and attempts to kill his wife and son.Atmospheric horror, superb background sound-effects, top notch performances by veteran actors Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall and Scatman Crothers and the best child actor I have seen to date: Danny Lloyd.Danny is simply gorgeous all though the film. At such a young age his acting is phenomenal. He is shoulder to shoulder with the big names in the film. The best and most memorable scene in the film is Danny sitting in Jack Nicholson's lap, having a father-to-son conversation.Jack Nicholson who portrays the writer and ex-schoolteacher, gives a professional performance and thoroughly gets into the act. The character he portrays literally undergoes a transformation before your eyes. He is complemented well by Shelley Duvall who plays the wife of Jack's character. She portrays a simple housewife who passes her time with household chores and taking care of their only son. Danny Lloyd who plays Jack's son is simply a joy to behold throughout the film. The role fits him like a glove and his acting is simply phenomenal. Not to forget to mention Scatman Crothers who always gives his best to us. He is a born actor and his presence on screen is very powerful. The film really clicks into gear when he and Danny have a personal conversation about the Overlook Hotel over some ice-cream. And it is here that he mentions about that very special gift: The Shining....Overall 10/10. Add this one to your DVD collection.",10,0,1,24 February 2011
Over the Hedge," This Raccoon Is A Fast Food Addict!
","I really enjoyed this one. Also this is on of those beautifully scripted cartoon films with great all-round casting. The main character in this film is an adorable racoon called RJ (Bruce Willis), who accidentally obliterates a huge store of food which belongs to a bear called Vincent (Nick Nolte).Vincent gives RJ a week to replace the store of food. If RJ failed to accomplish this feat, Vincent vows to hunt him down and eat him.A frightened RJ finds small forested plot where a pack of hibernating animals have just awoken, surprised to find a large hedge that separates the forest from the human community. Verne the box turtle (Garry Shandling), the group's elder, urges the others to start stashing food for next year. RJ appears to the group and tells them they can collect all the food they will need within a week by raiding the humans' trash and homes. Verne is extremely pessimistic about crossing the hedge, but RJ is able to convince the others to join him.One of the big highlights in this animated film is Bruce Willis's voice acting is outstanding. He really gets into the act and seems to be enjoying voicing the character of RJ. The other voice actors complement him wonderfully, namely Garry Shandling, Wanda Sykes and Steve Carrell who voice-acts and adorable young squirrel named Hammy. In this cartoon you see the perspective from the animals and from the human's side. This film is jam-packed with good humor.Children and adults of all ages should find this animated film very appealing. And this one is DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING.",10,0,0,18 April 2011
Dangal," Another Good Aamir Khan film And Based On The True Story Of Mahavir Phogat.
","I have seen many good Aamir Khan films and this could be among his best ones. But I think my favorite is still Taare Zameen Par because it deals with a wide spectrum of problems faced by mentally challenged individuals in society.Plot: Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan) is a former amateur wrestler and national champion based in Balali, a village in Haryana. He was forced by his father to give up the sport in order to obtain gainful employment. Dejected that he could not win a medal for his country, he vows that his unborn son will. Disappointed upon having four daughters, he gives up hope. But when his older daughters Geeta and Babita come home after beating up two boys in response to derogatory comments, he realises their potential to become wrestlers and begins coaching them.His methods seem harsh, including grueling early morning workouts and short haircuts to avoid lice. Despite facing backlash from the villagers, he goes ahead with them, training them in his makeshift mud pit. Initially, the girls resent their father for his treatment but soon realise that he wants them to have a good future and not grow up to be stereotypical housewives. Motivated, they willingly participate in his coaching. Mahavir takes the girls to wrestling tournaments where they wrestle with boys and defeat them. Unable to afford wrestling mats, he uses two layers of mattresses and trains them in freestyle wrestling to prepare them for competitive events. Geeta goes on to win the junior and senior championships at the State and national level before heading to the National Sports Academy in Patiala to train for the forthcoming Commonwealth Games.Verdict: acting, direction, photography, background sound-effects and music of the film is superbly executed. Nitesh Tiwari who made his directorial debut by co-directing Chillar Party (2011) which won the National Film Award for Best Children's Film for that year, directs Dangal with an extremely innovative approach. He makes us feel we are in the middle of the film.Similar films to watch: Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar(1992), Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India(2001), Iqbal(2005), Apne(2007), Irudhi Suttru(Tamil 2014) and remake Saala Khadoos(Hindi 2016).Thanks for reading my review, live long and prosper.",8,0,0,10 November 2017
Disturbia," A Sure Way To Spoil A Good Film Is To Add A T*rd Called Shia Labeouf.
","I new did like the guy who has wormed his way into some big budget movies, namely The Transformers Franchise + Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.Acting ability: does an earthworm know how to dig? Looks: like your average teenage supermarket attendant. Brains: well he does know how to unzip his fly... Pedigree: bred by a bunch-o-hippies.Back to the film: its an adaptation of the classic Hitchcock suspense film Rear Window, where a wheelchair-ridden man is suspected of killing his wife and then hiding her remains. In THIS film the plot is changed to a man Robert Turner played by the excellent David Morse (The Green Mile) who is suspected of luring women into his home and then killing them and disposing of their bodies. Carrie Ann Moss plays mother to LaBeouf's character. Moss never could act so she should instead be pursuing a career in the porno industry before she gets to old to spread her stuff.The best actor is Morse and he gets wasted in this film.Overall: if you are suffering from insomnia this is a good film to watch and hopefully you'll be fast asleep before it ends!!!",5,1,3,9 April 2012
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Guillermo Del Toro is a shoe-in for this sort of films...
","But this film is not quite as good as Hellboy. Of course any child or grown-up knows the classic tale of Hansel and Gretel by the Brothers Grimm. It is about a brother and sister(Hansel and Gretel) abandoned deep within the woods by their father who follows every command of their newly acquired evil stepmother. Hansel lays a trail of white pebbles during the trip.After their parents abandon them, the children wait for the moon to rise and then they follow the pebbles back home. They return home safely, much to their stepmother's horror. Once again provisions become scarce, and the stepmother angrily orders her husband to take the children further into the woods and leave them there to die. Hansel and Gretel attempt to gather more pebbles, but find the doors locked and find it impossible to escape from their parents' house.The following morning, the family treks into the woods. Hansel takes a slice of bread and leaves a trail of bread crumbs to follow home. However, after they are once again abandoned, the children find that birds have eaten the crumbs and they are lost in the woods.The children try to find a way out, but stumble across a witches hut made out of every sort of sweet things imaginable: cakes, cookies, sugar candy, chocolate, cream etc., etc. The children begin to consume parts of the house when the door to the house opens and out pops an old woman who invites them in and sets before them a scrumptious feast. She is actually an evil witch who uses the house to lure unsuspecting children on whom she feasts.Her plan was to fatten Hansel and then to eat him. So after the children have eaten, she immediately puts Hansel in cage and locks it. She then orders Gretel to do all sorts of chores in the house, of which the most important was to feed Hansel. As the days passed the witch asked Hansel to stick out his finger which she feels to see if he is fat enough to be cooked and eaten. But Hansel cleverly offers a bone he found in the cage (presumably a bone from the witch's previous captive) and the witch feels it, thinking it is his finger. Due to her blindness, she is fooled into thinking Hansel is still too thin to eat. After weeks of this, the witch grows impatient and decides to eat Hansel, 'be he fat or lean.' She prepares the oven for Hansel, but decides she is hungry enough to eat Gretel, too. She coaxes Gretel to open the oven and prods her to lean over in front of it to see if the fire is hot enough. Gretel, sensing the witch's intent, pretends she does not understand what she means. Infuriated, the witch demonstrates, and Gretel instantly shoves the witch into the oven and slams and bolts the door shut, leaving 'The ungodly witch to be burned to ashes', with the witch screaming in pain until she dies. Gretel frees Hansel from the cage, and the pair discover a vase full of treasure and precious stones. Putting the jewels into their clothing, the children set off for home. A swan ferries them across an expanse of water, and at home they find only their father; his wife died from unknown causes. Their father had spent all his days lamenting the loss of his children, and is delighted to see them safe and sound. With the witch's wealth, they all live happily ever after.Okay on to THIS FILM: After destroying the witch, Hansel and Gretel become famed bounty hunters dedicated to mercilessly eradicating witches, slaying over six hundred of them. Their work is relatively easy because, for an unknown reason, they are immune to spells and curses. Hansel, however, is diabetic as a result of his ordeal and needs to take a regular shot of insulin every few hours.One day, in the town of Augsburg, Hansel and Gretel prevent Sheriff Berringer from executing Mina, a young woman accused of witchcraft. Mayor Englemann has hired the siblings to find and rescue several children abducted by witches.Watch this film to find out what happens next! This film is fasted paced with graphic action scenes and gore and has some nudity. Therefor I wouldn't recommend this film for children under 13 years.Notable Stars: Famke Jannsen(Deep Rising,X-Men Trilogy, Goldeneye, Lord Of Illusions), Peter Stormare(Fargo, 8mm, Lockout) and Jeremy Renner (Dahmer(MUST SEE FILM!) The Avengers)). Similar films: Hocus Pocus (1993), Warlock(1989).",7,2,3,14 August 2013
Rocky IV," John Cafferty's Song Hearts On Fire Is The Big Hightlight.
","No complaints here Sly. Masterpiece. But I still felt that the ending fight was too short and I didn't like the editing of the fight. A more extended fight sequence would have been preferable.Great music and great action. Commendable acting by supporting actors and actresses namely Carl Weathers, Burt young, Talia Shire, Bridgette Neilson, Michael Pataki and Tony Burton. Dolph Lundgren is absolutely phenomenal as the Russsian Boxer Ivan Drago and I think should have been given an Oscar for his performance.Stallone looks more physically built up than we saw him earlier in Rocky 3. The fight at the end of the film is not that pacey as the one we saw in Rocky 3 against Mr. T.The great blockbuster music is the highlight. 'Hearts On Fire' by John Cafferty and 'No Easy Way Out' by Robert Tepper are the best ones.The training sequences showing both Rocky's and Drago's at the same time was Sly's genius. The best dialogue in the film was when Rocky tells his some that 'when you can go one more round when you don't think you can makes all the difference in your life'. Yes this is VERY true.Synopsis: Russian Boxer Ivan Drago wants a match against Rocky. Apollo Creed sees this as another opportunity to get into the ring. He asks Rocky a favor, to be at his side as his corner-man in a friendly exhibition match against Drago. Rocky reluctantly agrees.Drago dominates and punishes Apollo in the fight. He delivers a last brutal punch to Apollo's head killing him instantly. Rocky is devasted. In order to honor Apollo's spirit he decides to take a rematch against Drago against Adrain's wishes. But will Rocky triumph over Drago. See this blockbuster film of 1985 to find out. A must have for any DVD/BLU-RAY collection. 10/10. Brilliant Sly. Absolutely Brilliant.",10,2,4,27 September 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," I still remember vividly, going to the cinema to watch the first Mission Impossible.
","How time flies. This is the fifth installment in the franchise and it shows no signs of stopping. This film deals with a shadowy organization called 'The Syndicate'. The job of The Syndicate is to eradicate all existing IMF field operatives.Naturally The Syndicate crosses paths with Ethan Hunt, and then, all hell ensues. As with all the mission impossible films, action remains the prime focus. We have high-speed car chases, speed-bike chases, underwater action and plenty of gun action in between.We have Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson in her debut Mission Impossible role. My favorite actor 'The Main Man' Alec Baldwin makes his first appearance in the franchise. I'm always glad to see him. I consider him the best of the Baldwin brothers in both appearance and personality. He is capable of carrying an entire film on his own if given the opportunity. Check his films out: as Adam Maitland inBeetlejuice (1988), as Jack Ryan in the action thriller The Hunt for Red October (1990), as Lamont Cranston in The Shadow(1994 too good film), as Robert 'Bob' Green alongside Oscar winning British actor Anthony Hopkins in The Edge and as Jed alongside Nicole kidman in Malice(1993).Back to the film. Tom Cruise plays his role in a stereotypical fashion. He acts know for acting's sake and to show the world that he still is as young as he used to be. But time conquers all. As in the classic tale of the tortoise and hare, the one who started last, ends up winning. I'm referring to time/downfall as the tortoise and youth and beauty/success as the hare. Another moral: no one can claim to be immortal - good luck Mr. Cruise.You can even see the class difference between Alec Baldwin and Tom Cruise. Alec is clearly a superior and much underrated actor. Alec is four years older than Tom. I must again mention that casting Mr. Pegg as a sidekick to inject a dose of comedy in the movie is a bad idea. Why not instead cast Jim Carrey for the role. Probably for the reason that he'd steal the show. I also do not like Ving Rhames. I prefer Jean Reno over Rhames.Verdict: Christopher McQuarrie who is mostly a writer known for winning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for The Usual Suspects, directs the film. His other directed films Jack Reacher and The Way Of The Gun. I would not call him an experienced director. Joe Kraemer handles the music in the film. He does his job well, however he has only worked in a meager amount of B-films. An Alan Silvestri, James Horner, Christopher Young, Jerry Goldsmith, Basil Poledouris, Giorgio Moroder, Danny Elfman he will never even approach those Titans Of Film Music. Robert Elswit is the real veteran cinematographer in the group and he is the one that saves this film from utter disaster. Now I must mention the villain in the film: Sean Harris who I immediately recognized because he starred in Prometheus(2012). He is incompetent in the role of a villain. I have seen better villains like Allan Rickman who played Hans Gruber in Die Hard(1988), Anthony Hopkins as the nefarious doctor Hannibal Lector, Doug Bradley who played Pinhead in the Hellraiser films. Overall a decent way to spend some time but inferior to the original first film which remains the best in the franchise.Thank you for reading my review. Live long and prosper.",6,3,5,4 January 2016
Aliens," The Story Continues From Ridley Scott's Alien....
","The last time we saw Ripley, she was in an escape shuttle, in hyper-sleep on a course to Earth.The story now continues from this point.Full Plot: Her shuttle is intercepted by a deep-space salvage team. They secure the shuttle and board it and find Ripley still alive in her cryo-tube. She is later revived and is told that she had been drifting in space for the last fifty-seven years. She inquires about her daughter but is told that she recently passed away from old age.At an interview before a panel of executives from her employer, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, her testimony regarding the Alien is met with extreme skepticism as no physical evidence of the creature survived the destruction of the Nostromo. Ripley loses her space flight license as a result of her 'questionable judgment' and learns that LV-426, the planet where her crew first encountered the Alien eggs, is now home to a terraforming colony.Some time later, Ripley is visited by Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lieutenant Gorman (William Hope) of the Colonial Marines, who inform her that contact has been lost with the colony on LV-426. The company decides to dispatch Burke and a unit of marines to investigate, and offers to restore Ripley's flight status and pick up her contract if she will accompany them as a consultant. Traumatized by her previous encounter with the Alien, Ripley initially refuses to join, but accepts when she realizes that the mission will allow her to face her fears, which had been plaguing her since her first encounter. Aboard the warship Sulaco she is introduced to the Colonial Marines, including Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews), Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn), Privates Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) and Hudson (Bill Paxton), and the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen), toward whom Ripley is initially hostile due to her previous experience with the android Ash aboard the Nostromo.The heavily-armed expedition descends to the surface of LV-426 via dropship, where they find the colony seemingly abandoned. Two living Alien facehuggers are found in containment tanks in the medical lab, and the only colonist found is a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt (Carrie Henn). The marines determine that the colonists are clustered in the nuclear-powered atmosphere processing station. There they find a large Alien nest filled with the cocooned colonists. The Aliens attack and kill most of the unit, but Ripley rescues Hicks, Vasquez, and Hudson. With Gorman knocked unconscious during the rescue, Hicks assumes command and orders the dropship to recover the survivors, intending to return to the Sulaco and destroy the colony from orbit. However, a stowaway Alien kills the dropship pilots in flight, causing the vessel to crash into the processing station; subsequently, the surviving humans barricade themselves inside the colony complex.Ripley discovers that it was Burke who ordered the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship where the Nostromo crew first encountered the Alien eggs, and that he hopes to return Alien specimens to the company laboratories where he can profit from their use as biological weapons. She threatens to expose him, but Bishop soon informs the group of a greater threat: the damaged processing station has become unstable and will soon detonate with the force of a thermonuclear weapon. He volunteers to use the colony's transmitter to pilot the Sulaco's remaining dropship to the surface by remote control so that the group can escape. Ripley and Newt fall asleep in the medical laboratory, awakening to find themselves locked in the room with the two facehuggers, which have been released from their tanks. Ripley is able to alert the marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. Ripley accuses Burke of attempting to smuggle implanted Alien embryos past Earth's quarantine inside her and Newt, and of planning to kill the rest of the marines in hypersleep during the return trip. The electricity is suddenly cut off and numerous Aliens attack through the ceiling; Hudson, Burke, Gorman, and Vasquez are killed, and Newt is captured by the Aliens.Ripley and an injured Hicks reach Bishop and the second dropship, but Ripley is unwilling to leave Newt behind. She rescues Newt from the hive in the processing station, where the two encounter the Alien queen and her egg chamber. Ripley destroys most of the eggs, enraging the queen, who escapes by tearing free from her ovipositor. Closely pursued by the queen, Ripley and Newt rendezvous with Bishop and Hicks on the dropship and escape moments before the colony is consumed by the nuclear blast. Back on the Sulaco, Ripley and Bishop's relief at their narrow escape is interrupted when the Alien queen, stowed away on the dropship's landing gear, impales Bishop and tears him in half. Ripley battles the queen using an exosuit cargo-loader. The two of them tumble into a large airlock, which Ripley then opens, expelling the queen into space. Ripley clambers to safety and she, Newt, Hicks and the still-functioning Bishop enter hypersleep for the return to Earth.Epic is a small word to describe this film. The direction, background music and special effects is nothing short of 'out-of-this-world'. All the actors in the film excel in the roles given to them.Notable Actors: Lance Henriksen makes an impact as the android Bishop. William Hope is superb as Lieutenant William Gorman.Paul Reiser is outstanding as Carter J. Burke, the corporate lawyer for the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.Michael Biehn gives a solid performance as Corporal Dwayne Hicks.Jenette Goldstein plays the macho female Private Jenette VasquezMark Rolston plays Private Mark Drake, Private Vasquez's smart-gun partner.Carrie Henn plays Newt, real name Rebecca Jorden, a child who is the only survivor of the colony on LV-426. She forms a close bond with Ripley.Overall 10/10 points. Buy the 'special edition' with the 17minutes added footage on DVD/BLU-RAY.",10,1,2,14 December 2010
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," 2011 was a magical year for M.S. Dhoni and Indian Cricket.
","The film is about the life of cricketer Mahendra Singh as a boy, progressing into teenager and finally as an adult. It shows how he rose above all obstacles to achieve greatness. The film also looks into his personal relationships with the only two women in his life - one who he lost to a tragedy: the late Priyanka Jha and the other who he later met eventually became his wife, Sakshi Rawat.The film starts with Dhoni's birth. Later we see him as a boy in school training as a goalkeeper. A teacher(who is also a school cricket coach) spots him and notices his goalkeeping ability and immediately realizes what a good wicket-keeper he would be, given the proper training. He calls Dhoni, who at first is reluctant, but then agrees for a trial. At the trial, he impresses his coach and finally agrees to full-time training. Dhoni's father objects to his concentrating more on cricket rather than focusing his attention on his studies. He eventually goes against his dad's wishes to embark on a career that can only be described as 'magical'. The film shows the hardships faced by Indian cricketers. We also see the choices faced by the I.C.C.(Indian Cricket Council) when choosing the right cricket player for the Indian team and the politics involved. M.S. Dhoni was among a batch of players that included another legend Yuvraj Singh. Eventually their partnership in cricket would be lethal and a key for the success of the Indian cricket team.No doubt, a lot of other players contributed to the Cricket World Cup 2011 win: Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Harbhajan Singh and Ravichandran Ashwin among many others. (Full Lineup: http:// www.espncricinfo.com /icc_cricket_worldcup2011 /content /squad /497114.html)Neeraj Pandey has already captured Bollywood's attention with films like A Wednesday(2008), Special 26(2013), The Royal Bengal Tiger(2014) and Baby(2015). Sushant Singh Rajput plays the role of Dhoni very well and veteran actor Anupam Kher plays the role of Dhoni's father. The photography of the film is superb along with the direction and background music. The songs in the film are also decent.Thank you for reading my review, live long and prosper.",7,0,0,3 November 2016
Batman Begins," Christian Bale's Sh*t Begins...
","You could also put it this way: the *rse-end of C.B. smells like a bat.Why on EARTH and in the name of all the SAINTS in HEAVEN did they cast C.B. for the role of Bruce Wayne?A British director? Yes of course. These days they can't find American directors. The director of memento and insomnia, apparently suffers from insomnia himself. There are a job lot of British/Irish actors: Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, C.B. Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy etc. etc. Only consolation (for U.S. born Batman fans) is that Morgan Freeman/Katie Holmes are in it.Story/plot? Could have used some finesse... We already know how Bruce Wayne's parents were killed and how he vowed to uphold justice and protect the weak blah,blah,blah...The introduction of Henri Ducard a.k.a. Ra's Al Ghul played by Neeson is the pillar of the plot. Apparently Al Ghul trains Bruce Wayne(?) who later becomes a thorn in Al Ghul's side. So why on earth would Al Ghul train him in the first place? (laughable plot!)Wayne later uses the gadgets made by his dad's biz and uses them to create the early Bat-sh*t-suit(version 1) and save the day.So there you have it kiddies, if your suffering from measles, flu, diarrhea, it would HIGHLY recommend this flick.",Null,2,3,8 November 2011
The Princess Bride," Princess Buttercup and Prince Humperdi(n)ck? Read between the lines(LOL).
","Basically a fairytale sort of film with some black humor thrown in, that young children won't understand. I have seen a lot of fairy tale films, and this film can be considered a passable entry in that genre.A grandfather(Peter Falk) reads a book to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). Scenes of the reading occasionally interrupt the main story. The story is about a girl of wealth Buttercup(Robin Wright) who falls in love with a lowly farm boy Westly(Cary Elwes). This young man, aware of the great gulf between them, decides to go abroad and make his fortune and return a wealthy, worthy man fit enough to marry a princess. However complications ensue that involves a certain prince Humperdinck(Chris Sarandon) who wants to marry Buttercup.Five years later, Buttercup reluctantly agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck after hearing news that Westly is dead. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three outlaws: a Sicilian boss named Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), a giant named Fezzik (André the Giant), and a Spanish master fencer named Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), who seeks revenge against the six-fingered man who killed his father. Two separate forces pursue them: Prince Humperdinck with a complement of soldiers, and a masked man dressed in black.Who is the mysterious man in black? What is going to happen next? Watch the film to find out more.I do not consider the high rating people have given to this film. I personally find films like The Neverending Story, The Wizard Of Oz and Return To Oz, Conan The Barbarian, Krull and Paperhouse much superior. Thank you for reading this review. May you live long and prosper.",5,1,4,1 August 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," I still prefer the original 2012 Avengers movie.
","This is the full live-action film debut of Thanos(voice-acted by Josh Brolin of No Country For Old Men fame). The film's plot seems heavily inspired from the works of J. R. R. Tolkien. Namely: The Lord Of The Rings.Plot: Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers unite to battle their most powerful enemy yet -- the evil Thanos. On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment.. This movie like all the other movies before it relies heavily on modern C.G.I. graphics. These days Hollywood movies use C.G.I.(Computer Generated Imagery) like a crippled man uses his crutches. And also beefed up sound-effects...All the actors play their roles as programmed R.P.G. characters play out in a video game. There is a lack of casting and acting talent these days in Hollywood. Indeed this era is the most uninspiring compared to the legendary 80's era, where some of the greatest movie to ever grace the silver screen were made. Verdict: I would recommend this film as a time-pass sort of movie where you have nothing to do but kill time(figuratively speaking).",4,2,7,2 September 2018
Insidious," The Downfall Of The U.S Horror film industry...
","If this is the best James Wan can do, his directorial days are numbered. It seems Hollywood has a habit of churning out crappy horror films. Make anything to earn a buck.The topic of this film isn't new at all. Astral projection. I had seen a film of this sort long ago. It was called Out Of The Body (1989). It was about a man who unknowingly goes out of his body in his sleep and kills beautiful women. Then I saw The Blue Man (1985). This one was about a dissatisfied Montreal director of TV commercials is taught to astrally project himself by a mysterious woman. But soon he finds that he does it against his will when he sleeps, and while he does it, he commits savage acts against those in his life. Then I saw The Poltergeist Trilogy of films and The Nightmare On Elm Street. A seasoned horror film fan. I have watched horror films going back to the 30's. Nothing is new to me. This film is especially made for newbie horror movie lovers who have no experience at all and for whom this film is made. That's where all the cash comes from. I pity these suckers who spend their hard earned money on this film.Plot of film: a family of five (husband, wife, two small boys and a baby), move into a new house. Their youngest son has the habit of astrally projecting himself during his sleep and wandering the realms beyond, until he gets trapped in a far-off place called 'The Further'.The boy's father has the same inherent ability. He has to go into hypnosis, project himself astrally and rescue his son.This was the biggest mistake made in the film. All of James Wan's films have terrible endings. This one is NO exception. Verdict: either watch it online for FREE. Or RENT IT CHEAP, or borrow the DVD from a sucker who has already bought it and now plans to use it as a Frisbee.",4,3,10,30 April 2011
Sultan," This Isn't A Salman Khan Film, It Is The Salman Khan Film
","Pehlwani or Kusti is a form of wrestling from South Asia. It was developed in the Mughal Empire by combining native malla-yuddha with influences from Persian koshti pahlavani. In this film, traditional Indian Kusti meets the world of MMA(mixed martial arts).Plot of film: Sultan Ali Khan (Salman Khan) falls in love with Aarfa Hussain (Anushka Sharma), a state-level wrestler and the daughter of a local wrestling coach. Although she was initially cold towards him, Aarfa accepted Sultan as a friend. When he began to proclaim that she was his girlfriend, she rejected him by stating that she wishes to marry an accomplished wrestler like herself. Determined to win her respect, Sultan dedicated himself to intense training and ultimately wins a state-level wrestling tournament, as well as Aarfa's love.The two are married and became recognized wrestlers, representing India in various international tournaments like the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games. When the two were announced as finalists for the Olympic Games, Aarfa discovered that she was pregnant. She gave up her childhood dream of winning an Olympic gold medal for India, which was then fulfilled by Sultan. To her surprise, Sultan's accomplishment made him arrogant, and he acted conceitedly during a press conference. Even though Aarfa informed him that she was nearing her due date, Sultan left to win another international wrestling championship.Then an incident occurs that changes Sultan's life forever. You have to see the film to find out what happens. The film is directed by Ali Abbas Zafar. He is well known for directing Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, and Gunday. Artur Żurawski is responsible for the excellent photography in the film, A native of the Baltic port city of Szczecin, he is a graduate of the Academy of Visual Arts in Poznań and the National Film School in Łódź. In 2014, he was the director of photography on the Indian crime thriller Mardaani, directed by Pradeep Sarkar, produced by Aditya Chopra, with Bollywood star Rani Mukerji in the leading role.We have excellent music in the film Julius Packiam contributing the musical score and the duo Vishal-Shekhar handling the songs. Randeep Hooda makes an excellent short appearance in the film as Sultan's trainer. We have some real life MMA wrestlers in the film Tyron Woodley the most predominant of them.Verdict: my eyes never left the screen from start to finish. I was lest thoroughly satisfied. There is a solid twist in the film which I couldn't predict. This is why I rate this film very highly. I am giving the highest rating possible because I am encouraging Bollywood to make more movies like these. You may also like this film, which I rate very highly: Saala Khadoos(Irudhi Suttru Tamil version) starring R. Madhavan.",10,2,5,16 July 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Sequel Should Have Been Better Than Original. A Testament To Poor Screen writing And General Lack Of Good Ideas.
","After thoroughly enjoying the first part of The Amazing Spider-man, I was expecting a move involving and better film plot-wise, with a villainous character who is able to assert himself. This film is normally aimed at the teen generation and not the adult, old and loyal fans of Spider-man who have been seeing him on television since the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's.Ted Raimi was the guy that I feel damaged the franchise by casting Tobey Maguire who I feel was not mature enough to play the part of Spider-man. The later two sequels to Raimi's film confirmed this. The character of the 60's and 80's animated Spider-man was the best because Peter Parker was a scientist at heart and he used his brains - not agility to get out of sticky situations. If you own the original 1967 animated Spider-man DVD, than you should be very happy, as this were the best Spider-man episodes ever made. And in addition to this you could add the 80's and 1994 animated Spider-man series to complete your collection.In this film a new super-villain is introduced known as Electro (played by Jamie Foxx) who has never been seen in a live action movie but has only appeared in the animated version. The Green Goblin also makes his appearance, but he is so similar to Hobgoblin played by Willem Dafoe in the Ted Raimi directed film. Plot: Peter Parker is haunted by visions of Gwen's deceased father, police captain George Stacy. This does not bode well, as similar visions by a well known soothsayer predicted the death of a well known Roman emperor. Call it a sort of premonition. Peter ends his relationship with Gwen as a result of a vow made to her father.However he can't hide the fact that he loves her deeply and that she is a part of his life, and so he returns to her.In all this confusion, OsCorp Industries employee Max Dillon has a horrendous accident with some genetically altered electric eels(in the same way like the Spectacular Spider-man Episode). He becomes Electro. Add to this the passing of Norman Osborn who before dying tells his son Harry that he has a rare hereditary transmitted disease. Harry takes the formula which was funded by his father, but created by Peter's father who was a genius in the field of bio-genetics with disastrous results to his personality. Watch the film to find out what happens next.I found the script pathetic, but the special effects were good. Andrew Garfield's acting and attitude in the film is like that of teenager. His acting in the previous installment was better and he should have improved upon that. I'm not a fan of Emma Stone and I have seen much prettier actresses in my life: Kari Wuhrer, Valentina Vargas, Angelina Jolie and Julia Roberts. How they can cast her when there are a lot of beautiful women in the U.S.A., is a mystery. Jamie Foxx is suffering from apparent hair-loss as seen in the film. He should either shave his head or resort to hair transplants if he wants to keep looking as good as he was in earlier days. His plus point is his acting, and he is definitely getting better and better with age. Dane DeHaan gives a solid performance as both Harry Osborn and The Green Goblin. Verdict: Not one I'll want to see again, as I've a lot of better films in my DVD collection. So I'll give it a score of 5/10.You can now build your own home cinema for a lot less than in previous years as LED TV's are cheaper. By a HD GRAPHICS CARD: Radeon HD5450 with Hyper-memory and a 32' Sony Bravia Smart W674A Led TV and creative A100 SBS 2.1 speakers and you're set to go. You can hook this up to your desktop or laptop if it has an HDMI port and play HD movies directly from your PC.I have the above setup and I enjoy my films immensely.",5,1,4,18 August 2014

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," You Can ALWAYS BET ON MR. David FINCHER for a good flick!!!
","I consider this guy the among the best directors in Hollywood. Rest of the pick are Ridley Scott, John Mctiernan, David Cronenberg, and Michael Mann.This film has a very, very interesting topic about reverse aging and an engrossing character named Benjamin Button.'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is based on a short story written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and first published in Colliers Magazine on May 27, 1922. It was subsequently anthologized in his book, Tales of the Jazz Age, which is occasionally published as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Jazz Age Stories. Development rights to the story were held for years by the late Hollywood mogul Ray Stark. Stark retained those rights until his death in 2004, when they were purchased from his estate.The film adaptation DIFFERS GROSSLY from the short story.Brad Pitt, the actor I liked in Fincher's bleak thriller Seven, does a professional job in his role as Button. Cate Blanchett plays Daisy Fuller, Benjamins's lover. She also complements Pitt's character. Other notable actors are: Taraji P. Henson as Queenie, who adopts Benjamin and fulfills her role as a mother to him. Jared Harris as Captain Mike Clark Benjamin who offers Benjamin a job on his Tugboat. Rampai Mohadi as Ngunda Oti, a pygmy who befriends Benjamin.Full Plot: In 2005, Daisy, an elderly woman, is on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital. Daisy asks her daughter, Caroline, to read aloud from the diary of Benjamin Button.In 1918, a boy is born with the appearance and physical maladies of a very elderly man. The baby's mother dies shortly after giving birth, and the father, Thomas Button, abandons the infant on the porch of a nursing home. Queenie and Mr. 'Tizzy' Weathers, who work at the nursing home, find the baby, and Queenie decides to care for him as her own.In 1930, 12-year-old Benjamin, having exchanged a wheelchair for crutches, befriends six-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home. As Benjamin's body grows younger, he accepts work on a tugboat. Benjamin also meets Thomas Button, who does not reveal that he is Benjamin's father. In 1936, Benjamin leaves New Orleans with the tugboat crew for a long-term work engagement and starts an affair with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of the British Trade Minister.In 1945, Benjamin returns to New Orleans, and learns that 21-year-old Daisy has become a successful ballet dancer. Benjamin again crosses paths with Thomas Button, who, terminally ill, reveals that he is Benjamin's father. Thomas wills Benjamin his possessions before he dies.Daisy's dance career is ended in Paris in 1957, when she is hit by a taxi cab and breaks her leg. When Benjamin goes to see her, Daisy is amazed at his youthful appearance, but frustrated at her own injuries; she tells him to stay out of her life. In 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of comparable physical age, they fall in love and move in together.Daisy gives birth to a girl, Caroline in 1968. Benjamin, believing he cannot be a father figure to his daughter due to his reverse aging, sells his belongings and leaves the proceeds to Daisy and Caroline. He travels the world alone during the 1970s.Benjamin, appearing to be in his early twenties, returns to Daisy in 1980. Now re-married, Daisy introduces Benjamin to her husband and daughter as a family friend. Daisy then visits Benjamin at his hotel, where they share their passion for each other. Daisy admits that Benjamin was right to leave; she could not have coped otherwise. Benjamin departs again.In 1991, widowed Daisy receives a phone call from social workers. They have found Benjamin — now apparently about 12 years old — living in a condemned building, and have contacted her because they found her name in his diary. The bewildered social workers say that his condition resembles dementia. Daisy moves into the nursing home where Benjamin grew up and takes care of him as he becomes increasingly younger until, physically, he becomes an infant once more. In 2003, he dies in Daisy's arms remembering who she was. Benjamin's story now told, Daisy dies in her New Orleans hospital bed, as Hurricane Katrina approaches.Verdict: Buy it on DVD! Other D. Fincher films I have seen that you may also like: Alien3(Directorial debut film 1992), Seven(1995), The Game(1997), Panic Room(2002).P.S: I think Fincher was robbed off the best picture award!",Null,1,2,15 October 2011
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," R.I.P. Carrie Fisher(1956-2016).
","I am writing the review for Star Wars The Last Jedi out of respect for the late Carrie Fisher who tragically passed away due to a heart attack on 27 December 2016. Her legacy will forever be immortalized in this film. I also want to say that I'm a big fan of Mark Hamill who plays the iconic character Luke Skywalker of the Star Wars franchise. This marks his fifth appearance following Star Wars The Force Awakens(2015). I respect him very much. He was my childhood hero - and still is. He gives his last best performance on screen.Carrie Fisher gives a good final performance as Princess Leia Organa, the sister of Luke Skywalker. However these two legends are overshadowed by a mediocre cast. Currently Hollywood is suffering from a real casting problem. We had really good actors in the past like Sean Connery, Richard Burton, Charles Bronson, Charlton Heston and many others who have a physical onscreen chemistry and personalty that raises a film from mediocrity. These days we have really immature disposable diaper-generation actors and actresses. These fellows have never done any rigorous theater-work, have no concept of what is acting and are just drafted in from obscurity. I hope Hollywood deals with this crisis before people stop watching films altogether. Plot in brief: Resistance forces, led by General Leia Organa, flee D'Qar when a First Order fleet arrives. Poe Dameron leads a costly counterattack that destroys a First Order dreadnought, but after the Resistance escapes to hyperspace, the First Order tracks them and attacks the Resistance convoy. Kylo Ren, Leia's son, hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother's presence, but his TIE fighter wingmen destroy the bridge, incapacitating Leia. Disapproving of new leader Vice Admiral Holdo's passive strategy, Poe helps Finn, BB-8, and mechanic Rose Tico embark on a secret mission to disable the tracking device on the lead ship. Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: Special effects are the core of Star Wars film and there are some unique effects - though a vast majority of them seem generic. And not to forget the background sound-effects and theme. Direction is according to the script which is very inadequate. This is my last review for Star Wars. It was a good enjoyable ride for me from childhood to adolescence with great memories of great actors: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Sir Alec Guinness, James Earl Jones who voiced Darth Vader, Billy Dee Williams, Kenny Baker who played R2D2 and Anthony Daniels who played C-3PO.Thanks for reading this review. Live long and prosper.",6,0,8,9 April 2018
Evil Dead," I've Seen More Evil In A Garbage Can. LOL!
","I saw the first Evil Dead(1981) film directed by Sam Raimi, who later directed two more' Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn(1987) and Army Of Darkness(1992) which was his last horror film. Then after a lapse of 17 years he directed Drag Me To Hell(2009) which I feel paid tribute to his die-hard followers of Zombie Horror(myself included!). But Drag Me To Hell lacked the bite(pun intended!) of his original first two Evil Dead Films.This 2013 remake's script was written by Sam Raimi and produced by Bruce Campbell who played the character of Ash in the Evil Dead Trilogy who did battle and eventually destroyed the Evil. Fede Alvarez was chosen to direct this film. He is an Uruguayan film director and screenwriter. He is best known for his short film Ataque de Pánico! On to the review. I have been watching horror films since the 1980's. With the help of internet I have seen horror films as old as the 1930's. I saw this remake in my mid-thirties. I am a hard-core horror fan and I have seen the most gruesome horror films which are so disturbing that they linger in your brain afterwards.Among the ones I have seen are Eden Lake (2008), Marian Dora's Cannibal (2006), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003 and the prequel film Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning 2006 as well as Tobe Hooper's Original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986). Also a separate film Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3(1990). I have also seen Wrong Turn (2003), Wrong Turn 2(2007) and Wrong Turn 3(2008). I have seen Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes and its remake. I have see George Romero's Night, Dawn and Day of the Living Dead. I have seen The Exorcist Trilogy of films written by William Peter Blatty. I have seen The Reanimator Trilogy Of films.The list is endless...So nothing is new to me: a hardcore horror fan. I watched this Evil Dead remake from start to finish without a twitch. The special effects in the film are standard. The sound effects these days are awesome with advent of surround sound technology. The direction of the film suffers in the area that there is no real plot in the film. A guy reads an incantation in the book and wham! The evil spirit is summoned and it starts to posses its victims who proceed to mutilate (or mutate LOL!) themselves. There is no clearly defined hero or heroine in the films. The actors are not seasoned enough to be able to lift the film with their on screen presence. There is no real climax in the film.The first Evil Dead film(which developed from Raimi's short Within The Woods) had a good selection of actors, who despite having no big films behind their backs, made the setting of the film come alive. There was solid atmospheric horror in the film and the zombie-makeup and effects was top-notch. The tension built steadily step by step, which is the hallmark of a good director. The climax itself is awesome and is left for last.Verdict: I don't think Fede Alvarez has future in directing more horror films. He should either change genres or pursue a career in directing theatrical shows or plays which is more rewarding. This is not due to any fault in the director but because of the over-flooded Hollywood film industry who are making more quantity then quality films. I think people have just run out of ideas.To all movie lovers: if you have a chance to go to a theater to watch a play, be it a classic, suspense or romance, DO SO. It is much better to go outside and get some fresh air with your loved ones and watching REAL ACTORS at work, than spoiling your eyes glaring at the big screen.",1,7,13,5 August 2013
Ip Man," Legendary Film about A Martial Arts Legend.
","This film deserves a 10/10 rating for it's realistic portrayal of the Japanese occupation of China. The mood and setting is exactly as it was during the 1930's in Foshan. Yip Man is seen in his home with his wife and son when patriarch of the Liu Fist Sect comes to visit him seeking a challenge. He says to Yip man that whatever the outcome of the contest between them, it would be a secret as to who won. Yip Man replies that he was just having lunch and asks his guest if he had dined. His guest replies no and so Yip Man invites him to lunch, after which they begin.Yip Man takes his opponent apart and exposes his errors in defence. In the end the grateful master acknowledges his defeat to the highly skilled Yip Man. However unknown to them both someone has seen the match and blabs the result to the townsfolk.Ip's reputation is further enhanced when he defeats an aggressive, rude, highly skilled Northern Chinese martial arts master, Jin Shanzhao, thus upholding the regional pride of fellow Southern stylists and others in Foshan.The Japanese invasion in 1937 adversely affects the life of everyone in Foshan. Ip's house is claimed by the Japanese and used as their Foshan headquarters. Ip and his family lose their wealth and are forced to move into a decrepit house. Desperate to support his family, Ip accepts work as a coolie at a coal mine.The Japanese General Miura, who is a Karate master, establishes an arena where Chinese martial artists compete with his military trainees. The Chinese earn a bag of rice for every match they win. Li Zhao, a former police officer and Ip's acquaintance, is now working as a translator for the Japanese and is making the offer to the martial artists working as coolies. Ip at first declines to participate in the matches. However, when his friend Lin goes missing, he agrees to take part in order to investigate. He is enraged when he sees a fellow Foshan master (Master Liu) mercilessly executed for picking up a bag of rice from a prior victory after giving up in a second match against three karatekas. He also comes to understand that Lin was killed in an earlier fight. Barely able to contain his rage, Ip demands a match with ten Karatekas at once. Despite having not practiced Wing Chun since the invasion began (in order to conserve what little food his family had to survive), he proceeds to mercilessly crush each of them with a brutal yet efficient barrage of his martial art mastery, showing barely any of the restraint he exhibited in previous engagements. His skill arouses the interest of Miura, who seeks to learn more about Ip and see him fight again.Ip visits his friend Chow Ching-chuen, who owns and runs a cotton mill in Foshan. Chow tells Ip that a highway robbery gang led by Jin Shanzhao is harassing his workers and extorting money from them. Ip trains the workers in Wing Chun for self defence. Meanwhile, Miura grows impatient when Ip does not return to the arena and sends men to find Ip. These men harass Ip's family, and Ip incapacitates them. Ip and his family then go into hiding at Li Zhao's house. Meanwhile, the robbers return to the cotton mill to demand money. The workers fight back using the techniques that Ip taught them. Just then, Ip appears and defeats Jin Shanzhao, warning him never to harass the workers again.The Japanese soldiers eventually find Ip at the cotton mill. Miura tells Ip that his life will be spared if agrees to instruct the Japanese soldiers in martial arts. Ip refuses and challenges Miura to a match, which Miura accepts, both because of his love for martial arts and because refusing the challenge would be a humiliation to the Japanese. The match between Ip and Miura is held in public in Foshan's square. At first, the two fighters seem equally matched, but Miura becomes overwhelmed and is unable to fend off Ip's attacks as he effortlessly uses him as a Wooden Dummy, inflicting a severe beating on him and clearly winning.As the beaten general lies down after his defeat, Ip looks over to the crowd and hears the Chinese cheering him; within the crowd, he spots his wife and child with Chow. Just then, Miura's deputy Sato shoots Ip. This sparks a scuffle between the Chinese audience and the Japanese soldiers. During the scuffle, Li Zhao kills Sato with Sato's own gun. Ip is taken away amidst the chaos. It is revealed that he survives and escapes to Hong Kong with his family. There, Ip establishes a Wing Chun school, where his students come to include Bruce Lee.Donnie Yen is superb in his portrayal as Ip Man. The rest of the cast puts in superb performances. Sammo Hung directs the excellent fight choreography. All in all director Wilson Yip does a great job.",10,2,2,3 July 2012
Jurassic World," Colin Trevorrow Could Be The Next George Lucas/Steven Spielberg.
","For the sheer spectacular special effects, background music and photography I give 10/10. The cast is also 10/10.But now comes the most important question, would I want to see this film again? The answer is a solid 'no'. Even if someone gave me a free ticket I would just give it back to him. The reason is this: predictable ending. The good-guys always make it without a scratch. Now why on earth would we go to see a film where we already know the outcome? Because we are born suckers. We spend all of our money on such filthy, depraved, generic trash films instead of doing something good with it such as buying a homeless person a meal or visiting and comforting someone who is terminally ill. Do not show any of your kids movies unless they are of an educative purpose or documentary, where they learn something. Take your kids to the park, camping or seaside rather then these films. Limit and monitor their internet use as well. Teach them to do simple household chores in your spare time. And make sure they are doing their homework.Back to the film: Twenty-two years after Jurassic Park was overrun by cloned dinosaurs on the Central American island of Isla Nublar, a new park, Jurassic World, has become a successful resort. The Masrani Global Corporation â€“ owner of the genetics company InGen that creates the dinosaurs â€“ has been operating the park on the same island for the past ten years. Brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World to see their aunt Claire, the park's operations manager. Claire, a busy workaholic, assigns her assistant to be their guide, but the boys evade her and explore the resort on their own.Verdict: pure 100% grade CGI effects churned by modern computers. Vincent D'Onofrio is the pick of the bunch followed by both Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt. The direction was so professionally handled, that I thought maybe Spielberg or Lucas was directing the film. Well it turns out that Colin T. Trevorrow who won the Waldo Salt Screen writing Award for Safety Not Guaranteed(2012) had been given the chance to direct this film. And thoroughly deserved. Also I'd like to mention Irrfan Khan is becoming a Hollywood regular with good films like The Amazing Spider-Man and Life Of Pi.",7,4,6,11 July 2016
Prisoners," This Is The Type And Quality Of Film I would Expect Of James Wan, but Denis Villeneuve Is light-years Ahead Of Him,
","If you are a lover of suspenseful films then I highly recommend this one. This is among the better films of 2013 and I would not hesitate in voting for this one as the best film of that year.The plot of the film is about the mysterious disappearance of two little girls while they are playing outside their parent's house.Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover a construction worker who is facing financial problems and barely making ends meet for his family. When his daughter is mysteriously kidnapped, he takes matter into his own hands by kidnapping a suspect whom the police release because of lack of evidence.Seasoned actor Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective David Loki who is assigned this case. Loki has a reputation for solving difficult cases and he takes this one as a particular challenge.Both actors give a thoroughly professional performance. The direction, script, background sound effects and bleak atmosphere enhance this film. This is a film you'll be left guessing till the end and even a veteran film buff like myself couldn't figure out the person who was behind the kidnapping.Similar films: The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (1992), When the Bough Breaks (1986), The Silence Of The Lambs (1991), Copycat (1995), Bone Daddy (1988), Resurrection (1999), The Deliberate Stranger(1986), The Gray Man (2007), Dahmer (2002), To Catch A Killer (1992), Seven (1995).Many more recommendations but I don't have time to write them all down. Message me if you're a film buff or critic.",10,1,2,8 February 2014
Logan," Perhaps The Last Time We See Hugh Jackman And Patrick Stewart In An X-Men Movie.
","Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are my favorite actors. Hugh Jackman cemented his role as Logan(a.k.a. Wolverine of the X-Men) whereas Patrick Stewart immortalized himself as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation. As I am writing this review, Patrick Stewart is 76 years old. I don't think he will act in a film ever again. This film marks the departure for Hugh Jackman as Logan. Back to the film. First of all, I should say that this film is violent. Perhaps one of the most violent X-Men movies I have seen. Also those of you expecting over the top C.G.I. effects will be disappointed. The effects are kept to a minimum to keep the film going. More emphasis is played on the relationship between professor X. Xavier and Logan. The professor has become old and has to be medicated because he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Logan has stayed behind to look after him. Caliban an albino mutant who has the ability to track other mutants has also stayed behind to help both Xavier and Logan. He offers Logan a lot of good advice, however Logan snubs him in his usual gruff manner. The film starts in the year 2029. mutants are on the brink of extinction, with no new mutants having been born in 25 years. James 'Logan' Howlett, formerly known as Wolverine, spends his days working as a chauffeur in Texas. His healing factor has faltered and, as a result, his body has aged greatly. One day, Logan is approached by Gabriela Lopez, a nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, who wants him to escort her and an 11-year-old girl named Laura to a place in North Dakota called 'Eden'. After reluctantly accepting the job from Gabriela, Logan discovers that she has been murdered. Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: Superb and mature acting by Hugh Jackman. He gives his best performance in what should be his last X-men film. During the screening of the film he and Stewart held hands and wept. This is no doubt due to the long relationship they had during the filming of the X-Men series of films. The cinematography and sound effects are adequate to the film. The film has a sort of gloomy/dismal setting which no doubt lets us know that the theme of the film is that all good things in life come to an abrupt end. People grow old - even mutants. But I do hope that the next generation has a bright future ahead of it. Thank you for reading this review.

Avengers: Age of Ultron," Promising Sequel Ruined By A Weak Plot And Overuse Of C.G.I.
","The first scene after the post credits have rolled in Avengers 2012, presents Loki explaining the failure of their attack on Earth to a mysterious alien, who turns and smiles at the idea of dealing with The Avengers would be 'courting death itself.' That alien is of course the previously rumored Thanos and the reason for the smile is that 'Death' is actually personified in the Marvel Universe as someone Thanos so desperately wishes to please. Brief plot: In the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers – Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton – raid a Hydra outpost led by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, who has been experimenting on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. They encounter two of Strucker's experiments – twins Pietro, who has superhuman speed, and Wanda Maximoff, who can manipulate minds and project energy – and apprehend Strucker, while Stark retrieves Loki's scepter.Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem, and secretly use it to complete Stark's 'Ultron' global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's A.I., J.A.R.V.I.S., and attacks the Avengers at their headquarters. Watch the film to find out what happens next and don't miss the post credits scene that reveals more of Thanos's agenda.Verdict: some of the characters do not do justice to their parts at all. They just act for the sake of acting, and getting a hefty paycheck at the end of filming. Samuel L. Jackson has a small role in the film as Nick Fury, and we see Stan Lee making a cameo appearance again as he did in Ant-man(2015). I was very disappointed with the acting of Chris Hemsworth in the role of the Norse God Thor. He is totally unsuitable to play the part. The best Thor I have seen, was Eric Allan Kramer who played the part in The Incredible Hulk Returns(1988). Regulars Robert Downey Jr.(Iron Man), Chris Evans(Captain America), Scarlett Johansson(Black Widow), Mark Ruffalo(Hulk), Jeremy Renner(Hawkeye) perform their respective duties in their respective roles - but fail to shine. Newcomers Elizabeth Olsen(Scarlet Witch) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson(Quicksilver) make their debut appearance. Don Cheadle, an Iron Man franchise regular, makes an appearance as War Machine. Anthony Mackie who is a versatile character that has appeared in Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the new Ant-man film.Veteran actor James Spader(Jack's Back 1988, Stargate 1994, Dream Lover 1994, Critical Care 1997, The Watcher 2000(his best film simply unmissable)) plays the titular character Ultron. He does full justice to his characterization of Ultron, as a single-minded progenitor of mankind's annihilation.Thank you for reading my review. Live long, prosper.",5,3,9,24 August 2015
Taken," The Best Film Of 2008
","An excellent film that exposes the kidnapping and trafficking of women. This film also raises the question why nothing is being done about this. Obviously high ranking officials in the Government are also involved in this which is the reason why it is still going on.There are such SCUM in the world that would sell their own sisters or daughters into prostitution.Back to the film. It was good to see Liam Neeson after a long time. Having seen his best films: Darkman and Rob Roy, I was in eager expectations. The film is relentless from start to finish with superb action sequences and strong to-the-point dialogue.Full Plot: Highly-skilled CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired in an effort to build a closer relationship with his teenage daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). His frequent absences made him a distant father and led to his divorce. Knowing Kim wants to be a singer, Bryan buys her an expensive karaoke machine for her 17th birthday, but he is upstaged by Kim's wealthy stepfather Stuart (Xander Berkeley), who surprises her with a horse.Later, Bryan's former colleague, Sam (Leland Orser), hires him to help provide concert security for a popular young singer, Sheerah (Holly Valance). When Bryan saves her from a knife-wielding attacker, Sheerah gratefully offers to help with Kim's musical aspirations.Bryan's ex-wife, Lenore, (Famke Janssen) and Kim persuade a reluctant Bryan into allowing Kim to travel to Paris with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) to visit museums. Bryan is angered to discover at the airport that the girls actually intend to follow a U2 concert tour throughout Europe, instead of it being a study abroad program like he was originally told.In Paris, Kim and Amanda meet Peter (Nicolas Giraud), a charming young stranger who suggests sharing a taxi from the airport. Peter learns that they are staying alone in Amanda's cousins' apartment. After they part, Peter phones someone and passes along what he has learned.While on the phone with Bryan, Kim sees men enter the apartment and abduct Amanda. Bryan starts recording the call, and instructs Kim to shout out information about the kidnappers when they come for her. Afterward, Bryan realizes that someone is listening on the phone and tells him that if they let his daughter go, he will drop the matter, but if not, 'I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.' The listener replies, 'Good luck.'Bryan has Sam analyze the recording; he determines that the abductors are likely part of the Albanian Mafia, which specializes in sex slavery. He tells Bryan and Lenore of a grim statistic: if Kim is not rescued within 96 hours, chances are she will never be found.When Bryan reaches Paris, he finds his first clue: a photograph of Peter on the memory card of Kim's cellphone. He finds Peter as he is after another victim at the airport. After a short chase, Peter is struck and killed by a truck. Bryan then turns to an old friend, Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin), previously a field agent of French Intelligence, but now working behind a desk.Eventually, the trail leads to a construction site with a makeshift brothel. Posing as a customer, Bryan notices a semi-conscious prostitute who has his daughter's jacket. He rescues her, killing several gangsters in the process. The girl tells Bryan the address of the house where she met Kim. Bryan bluffs his way in, pretending to be a corrupt policeman looking for a bribe. He identifies Marko Ocha as the one he spoke to on the phone, takes him prisoner and kills the other crooks. Searching the house, he finds Amanda dead, apparently from a heroin overdose.Bryan tortures Marko into revealing that, because Kim is a highly valuable virgin, she was sold to Patrice Saint-Clair (Gérard Watkins). He leaves Marko to die slowly from unending electric shocks. Needing more information, Bryan goes to Jean-Claude's home. Jean-Claude admits to accepting bribes to look the other way and tries to force Bryan at gunpoint to give up his search. Bryan shoots Jean-Claude's wife in the arm to pressure him into giving up Saint-Clair's address.Bryan impersonates a police commissioner to enter an exclusive party at Saint-Clair's mansion. He locates a secret underground facility where a sex-slave auction is underway. Kim is the last offering. Bryan forces a buyer to purchase her, but he is knocked unconscious before he can get to her. He awakens handcuffed to a pipe. After learning Bryan's motive, Saint-Clair orders him killed and leaves. Bryan frees himself, kills Saint-Clair's henchmen, and forces Saint-Clair to divulge Kim's whereabouts before executing him.Bryan sees Kim being forced onto a yacht. Bryan jumps aboard and dispatches the guards. He finds an Arab sheikh holding a knife to Kim's neck. The man starts threatening Kim's life, but before he could finish his sentence, Bryan shoots him in the head.After they return to the United States, Bryan surprises Kim with a visit to Sheerah for an audition.Verdict: an outstanding film overall reminiscent of Commando(1985) and Diehard(1988) in terms of action. A good purchase for your DVD collection.",10,2,3,14 January 2011

","The director who brought us great films like Abyss, Aliens, The Terminator, True Lies now brings us Avatar.Been watching too many Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings eh James?Stinks of Lord Of The Rings.Good special effects does not mean a good film. I thought the aliens were pretty ugly for my liking. Extreme usage of Computer Graphics Imaging (C.G.I.). Seems like I'm watching an adult version of Toy Story without the sex though.Nothing new here. The obvious title Avatar. Even a 3 year old would figure that out.Prepare to fry your eyeballs out if you want to watch this multicolored mash of a film.James Cameron has become immature. At his age making a kiddish film like Avatar, when he in the past made gory, gutsy films like Terminator and Aliens.Time to move into an old people home eh James?

Chariots of Fire," A Fitting Tribute To Some Of Finest Sportsmen That The United Kingdom Produced.
","This film is a fitting tribute to Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell who represented their respective countries in the 1924 Olympic Championship in France, in which Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell won the 100 m and 400 m events, respectively.The film is directed by Hugh Hudson who has directed some fine films like Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (1984) and Revolution (1985).The film explores the attitudes of the two main characters of the film: Abrahams(Ben Cross) and Liddell(Ian Charleson). While Abrahams runs for personal glory, Liddell runs for the glory of God and His Kingdom. Because of this, he refuses to run in the 100m event which was during the day of Sabbath.In the film we see Liddell is superior runner than Abrahams and beats him. This affects Abrahams mentally and do he looks to Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm), a professional trainer to give him an edge over Liddell.The casting, background music, acting and direction is superb and you will be glued to your seat from start to finish.",10,0,0,23 January 2014
Drag Me to Hell," Sam Raimi Tries To Re-Emulate The Success He Had With The Evil Dead Films.
","Nice try anyways. With his brain running on his Spidey-man films, Sam has lost his touch with horror films. I wonder why he ever was chosen to direct the Spider-man films. To me, I think John McTiernan, Ridley Scott, Michael Mann, David Fincher, David Cronenberg, Spielberg and Lucas team when they were in top form ages ago. Come to think of it, even Brian Yuzna (Re-animator 2, Beyond Re-animator) is a good choice.Well all said and done, Spidey is OLD NEWS now. Back to SAM I AM. This film is based on a Gypsy Curse cast by an old woman called Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) whose house was repossessed (I'm in tears already). The curse is cast on bank loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman). With the curse in effect, Christine must do all she can before time runs out and she is dragged to hell (literally speaking).This film claims to be made on a $30 million budget. Do you know how much that is? After watching the film any fool could notice, that it was made very 'CHEAPLY' as in SCI-FI channel films. This film is no Lawrence Of Arabia type of GRANDE film with scenic locations that are NON-US. This crap was shot in location in Pasadena, California.Question: Where-did-all-that-$-go? Answer: S.R's over-saturated piggy bank (or Hoggy-bank).I admired S.R for Evil Dead Trilogy and Darkman but this one is a below par effort.The acting in the film is similar to U.S. TV SERIAL STANDARDS.P.S I recommend you all to see Intruder (1989 film) written and directed by Scott Spiegel, the co-writer of Evil Dead 2. After watching this film, compare with Drag Me To Hell. Make your own judgement. U.S. Horror films churned out after the late 1990's are mainly crap. In fact this marks the point of decline...",Null,0,0,5 October 2011
Sinister," Who Said That There Are No Good Horror Film Directors Out There?
","Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant horror film, with an ending that will send shivers down your spine. Even a hardened horror film fan like myself, I am having second thoughts about seeing this movie again. Why? Because its so god-damn scary. I feel that if I watch it again, I will be like doing something forbidden: like Devil-worshiping. If you have seen that James Wan film Dead Silence, you know what happens at the very end of the film. This film is even scarier than Dead Silence, The Grudge and The Ring Combined.I might be even bold to say that this film is even better than The Exorcist. Because in The Exorcist, the evil is manifest and seen by all. Here the evil is so hidden, you have to be clever even to find it at all.Brief plot of film: The film opens with Super 8 footage depicting a family of four standing beneath a tree with hoods over their heads and nooses around their necks. An unseen figure saws through a limb acting as a counterweight, causing them all to be strangled. Months later, washed-up true crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) moves into the murdered family's home with his wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance), and their two children Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario). Ellison intends to use the murders as the basis for his new book, and hopes that his research will turn up the fate of the family's fifth member, a little girl named Stephanie who disappeared following the murders.Verdict: Engrossing horror film which will keep you glued to your seat. You may also want to see it again, so it would be a good idea to buy the DVD/BLU-RAY. Seasoned director Scott Derrickson who also directed The Exorcism Of Emily Rose, The Day the Earth Stood Still and Hellraiser: Inferno, does the best direction of his career. Veteran music director Christopher Young needs no introduction. With hits in his bag like Hellraiser, Hellbound: Hellraiser 2, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge, The Fly II, Hider In The House, The Dark Half, Copycat and Virtuosity, you expect class background music. The only notable star in the film Ethan Hawke, does a professional job and does not overact. Watch the film to find out what happens next!

The Fly," Prepare to witness the Metamorphosis! David Cronenbergs best film above all his others.
","This film is what made the world notice Cronenberg's genius at direction. It truly stands miles apart from the rest of his work.It is a fresh remake of the older 1958 film The Fly, based on George Langelaan's short story The Fly. You should see the 1958 film before you see this film. There is also a sequel Return of the Fly (1959).However back to the 1986 film. This story starts at an science convention where Veronica Quaife (played by Geena Davis), a journalist, meets Dr. Seth Brundle (played by Jeff Goldblum) who is a scientist and inventor. He goes in a conversation with Veronica saying to her that he has an invention that will 'change the world as we know it'. Veronica is intrigued. She drives Seth back to his apartment where he shows her his invention, a set of Telepods connected to each other. She however thinks that Seth is bluffing and that the Telepods are fake. Seth proceeds to show Verconica a demonstration of the Telepods true purpose. He asks Veronica for a personal object. She offers one of her stockings. He places it in a Telepod and activates a computer program to begin a teleportation sequence. He tells Veronica to keep an eye on the Telepod with the stocking in it. There is a flash of light and the the stocking miraculously disappears from sight. Veronica still thinks Seth is playing a game with her. Seth then diverts Veronica's attention to the other telepod where he retrieves her stocking. Veronica is amazed and begins asking a flurry of questions. How did Seth keep his invention from the world? How was the machine built and its workings? Seth tells Veronica not to write anything until he has fully mastered and corrected all the flaws of his invention.He tells Veronica that he can only transport inanimate objects. Transporting living organisms leads to their deaths when they are transported through the Telepods due to a defective re-integration process. He claims that the computer becomes 'crazy when handling flesh'. However he soon finds a way around that flaw with fatal consequences that will change his life and Veronica's forever.Watch the film to find out more.Brilliant direction by Cronenberg. The Telepods actually look like a fly's egg. Jeff Goldblum has all the mannerisms of a fly himself with his eye movements. Geena Davis is the sexpot of this film. Cronenberg's films have some allusion to sex in them and this film in no exception. The special make-up effects have to be seen to be believed. The musical score is by the veteran Howard Shore. Outstanding cinematography by Mark Irwin. Creature effects are by the brilliant Chris Walas. Overall 10/10 for the terrifying conclusion, casting and acting, brilliant special effects, background score and sound effects.The film has a sequel The Fly 2 (1989) which is a good follow-up in its own right and definitely worth watching for its special effects. It is directed by Chris Walas who did the special effects in The Fly (1986).",10,0,1,25 September 2010
Groundhog Day," Before Jim Carrey There Was Bill Murray.
","Though I'm not a big fan of Bill Murray, this film was highly entertaining and refreshing. Having missed a chance to see it in my youth, I am seeing this film for the first time in my thirties. These days I research about a film first before I see it. The concept of this film appealed to my imagination: a man repeating a specific day, Groundhog day, over and over again.With time, this man Phil Connors(Bill Murray) learns to turn every situation and encounter to his advantage. Some may think that this guy is evil since he can toy around with anyone without getting implicated. Bill Murray was the ideal character for this film since he is egocentric and sarcastic. His has the ability to make you laugh while remaining straight-faced. Only a few actors have this precious ability. The other noble person in the film is actress Andie MacDowell. She plays news producer Rita Hanson (MacDowell), who is the love interest of Phil.Will Phil ever escape this time-loop?

Limitless," I didn't like the ending. Its a happy ending film for the hero of this film.
","The photography of this film is superb. Sound FX and editing is top notch.The only downside is in the ending. If there was a shocker of an ending in this film, it would truly deserve a much higher rating from me. But the director allows the hero of this film to get away with CHEATING by using an experimental drug that makes him smarter than Superman, Lex Luthor and Batman combined.Plot: Edward 'Eddie' Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a writer who lives in New York City and has recently been dumped by his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) in addition to failing to meet the deadline to turn in his new book, which he hasn't started yet. One day, Eddie comes across Vernon Gant (Johnny Whitworth), the brother of his ex-wife, Melissa Gant (Anna Friel). Vernon is a drug dealer, and he offers Eddie a sample of a new nootropic drug, NZT-48, claiming it has the ability for humans to access 100% of the brain's power, as opposed to the normal 20%. Eddie accepts, and, much to his surprise, the drug does indeed work, allowing him to finish his book.Eddie asks for more of the drug, but he finds Vernon murdered and calls the police. He deduces that Vernon was probably killed by someone who wanted his stash. He finds the NZT and a wad of cash and uses them to turn his life around. He abandons his writing career and starts trading stocks, borrowing capital from a Russian mafia thug, Gennady (Andrew Howard).Eddie becomes rich at an incredibly fast pace and is soon employed by the powerful businessman Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro). Eddie also gets back together with Lindy. He is followed by a man in a tan coat (Tomas Arana). He also starts using more and more NZT, causing side effects to occur: lost time, frenetic activity, and heart palpitations.Eddie fails to accomplish a task assigned by Van Loon because of an NZT hangover, and fears he might even have killed a woman (Caroline Winberg). Suffering severe withdrawal symptoms due to the post-hangover attempt to quit NZT cold turkey, Eddie begins to feel incredibly sick and he turns to Lindy for help, revealing his addiction to NZT. Reluctantly Lindy agrees to retrieve his stash, hidden in her apartment and return it to him at her office.However, on the way back to Eddie, Lindy is intercepted en route by the man in the tan coat, and it becomes obvious that he is dangerous, as he gives chase to Lindy, killing two would-be saviors as she flees. Eddie by phone convinces her to take one of the pills, and Lindy makes a bold escape. Though Eddie is saved, Lindy is convinced that he will destroy himself because of NZT and breaks up with him again. He is contacted by ex-wife Melissa and learns that she had been an NZT addict. Worse, he learns that withdrawal from the drug causes major health and mental problems, possibly resulting in death. She warns Eddie to taper off the NZT before it is too late.Gennady tries one of Eddie's pills, realizes the effects and threatens Eddie until he agrees to give him more NZT. Despite Melissa's warnings, Eddie manages his consumption of the drug down to an acceptable level, then uses his fortune to hire a scientist to work on reverse engineering NZT, a process that could take years.He assists Carl on a corporate merger deal with rival businessman Hank Atwood (Richard Bekins). Before the deal can take place, Atwood falls ill. Noticing the man in the tan coat working with Atwood, Eddie realizes the man's true mission — to steal Eddie's stash of NZT for his boss, whose real illness is NZT withdrawal. The stash is stolen by Eddie's lawyer, Brandt (Ned Eisenberg), who is revealed to also be working for Atwood.Eddie is followed home, but manages to kill Gennady and two thugs with intelligence gained from what he believes to be the last of the NZT, which he drank directly from the deceased Gennady's bloodstream. Atwood dies, Brandt having kept the NZT for himself. Eddie agrees to work with the man in the tan coat to retrieve his stolen NZT at Brandt's house.One year later, Eddie's book has been published (titled Illuminating the Dark Fields — a reference to the novel on which the film is based), and Eddie is running for the United States Senate. In the midst of his campaign, Carl approaches Eddie with the revelation that he bought the company producing NZT and that the backroom NZT lab Eddie was financing has been shut down.Carl offers him an unlimited supply of NZT (admitting that they both know he is headed for Presidency); however, Eddie must use his political position to push Carl's agenda in return. Eddie refuses, claiming that he no longer needs the drug: his prolonged use, he says, has allowed him to come off of the drug and has permanently enhanced his brain.(In the alternate ending available on DVD, Eddie still rejects Van Loon's proposal. But it is then revealed Eddie is not off NZT, and vows that he will find a way out, saying, 'Isn't that what the pill does?')",Null,0,0,15 August 2011
Die Hard," John McClane is very hard to kill...
","Bruce Willis's character Detective John McClane has become legendary. He is walking barefoot and wearing a vest all through the film and saying a phrase in the film that has become world-famous. This is macho exemplified. Talk about action and it has to be a John McTiernan film, right? The legendary director of the film Predator (1987) starring Arnold Schwarzenegger yet again scores a hit.Plot? Who needs a plot in an action flick? On the other hand a good plot surely helps an action film, and this film is no exception. The plot is solid, the stage is set for McClane and its up to him to stop the baddies from fulfilling their objective.Plot: Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) leads a team of thirteen terrorists to the Nakatomi Plaza building to steal $640 million in bearer bonds from the Nakatomi vault. When Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi (James Shigeta) refuses to reveal the code for one of the vault's seven locks, Gruber executes him.Unknown to Gruber, Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) of the New York City Police Department who is also a guest in the building witnesses this event.McClane moves through the building, hiding from or killing the terrorists he encounters. He learns more of their motives while acquiring a two-way radio, C4 explosives, and detonators from the body of one terrorist. McClane uses the radio to attract the attention of the LAPD, who send Sergeant Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) to investigate.Who will prevail McClane or Gruber? Watch this film to find out more... or just BUY it on DVD/BLU-RAY.Die Hard follows its source material — Roderick Thorp's novel Nothing Lasts Forever — closely, much of the film's memorable scenes, characters, and dialogue taken directly from the novel. Nothing Lasts Forever, a sequel to Thorp's earlier novel The Detective, was written with the intention of being adapted into a film sequel to the film adaptation of The Detective, which starred Frank Sinatra. When Sinatra turned down the offer to star in the sequel, the story was altered to be a stand-alone film with no connections to The Detective.When Die Hard was released, it was highly acclaimed by critics and was considered one of the best action films of its era. Based on 50 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of critics gave Die Hard a positive review, with an average rating of 8.2/10.The film has 3 sequels Die-hard 2, 3, and 4.The film also spawned the PC games, Die Hard Trilogy (1997) and Die Hard: Nakatomi Plaza (2002).",10,1,2,12 December 2010

Sausage Party," I Have An Open Mind - But This Takes The Cake, Even For An Adult Animated Film.
","Nonetheless it is a fascinating watch because it brings common food items potatoes, sausages, buns, juice cartons, bagels etc., etc., to life with a voice and mind of their own. These days people are sexually open so we see references to homosexuality and lesbianism in the film. There are also graphic sex scenes played out at various points in the film. The use of the 'F' word is predominant throughout the film alongside other use of slang. There are also few scenes of gore.Plot in brief: In a supermarket called Shopwell's, the foods and other grocery items who live there worship the human shoppers as gods who take them to the 'Great Beyond' when they are purchased. Among the groceries in the store is a sausage named Frank (Seth Rogen), who has dreams of living with his hot dog bun girlfriend, Brenda (Kristen Wiig), in the Great Beyond, where they can finally consummate their relationship. Frank lives in a package with his best friends Barry (Michael Cera), Carl (Jonah Hill) and Troy (Anders Holm), who also look forward to life in the Great Beyond.Frank and Brenda's packages are chosen to leave Shopwell's, but their celebrations are cut short when a returned jar of Honey Mustard (Danny McBride), who has also been chosen, claims to other groceries in the shopping cart that the Great Beyond is not what they were led to believe. Before committing suicide, Honey Mustard tells Frank to visit a bottle of liquor named Firewater (Bill Hader), who is purportedly knowledgeable about the Great Beyond, so he can learn the truth.Watch the film to find out what happens next...Don't get me wrong, the animation is brilliant and there are many hilarious scenes in the film. But all this is overshadowed by the vulgarity which could have been watered down.Better animated films to watch(non CGI): Watership Down(1978), The Secret of NIMH(1982), The Plague Dogs(1982), The Great Mouse Detective(1986), Grave of the Fireflies(1988), The Secret World Of Arrietty(2010 based The Borrowers written by Mary Norton).I also recommend Mary And Max(2009) which is a stop-motion animated movie and a short animated film The Snowman(1982).",7,4,8,3 November 2016
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Jack's Most Iconic Role As The Carefree Hooligan Randle McMurphy.
","How on earth this film won 5 academy awards is beyond me. I have seen better films than this. Namely, Midnight Express directed by Alan Parker.Maybe its just that Jack represents the ideal American Citizen, or he's just very, very lucky.Jack plays Randle Patrick McMurphy, a recidivist anti-authoritarian criminal serving a short sentence on a prison farm for statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation. Thus McMurphy, safe to say is truly deserving to be put in an asylum. Jack should've got a maximum of 15 years for this offense alone. McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients. How on earth Fletcher won best Actress in Lead Role is beyond me. Her acting in this film is mediocre at best.McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader; his fellow patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, stuttering young man; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is belligerent and profane; and 'Chief' Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent six-foot-seven Native American believed to be deaf and mute.DeVito looked so young back then, I hardly recognized him. The best of the pick is my favorite actor Christopher Lloyd. This guy is simply awesome in all the films he stars in.McMurphy steals a hospital bus, herds his colleagues aboard, stops to pick up Candy (Marya Small), a party girl, and takes the group deep sea fishing on a commandeered boat. He tells them: 'You're not nuts, you're fishermen!' and they begin to feel faint stirrings of self-determination.Soon after, however, McMurphy learns that Ratched and the doctors have the power to keep him committed indefinitely. Sensing a rising tide of insurrection among the group, Ratched tightens her grip on everyone. During one of her group humiliation sessions, Cheswick's agitation boils over and he, McMurphy and the Chief wind up brawling with the orderlies. They are sent up to the 'shock shop' for electroconvulsive therapy. While McMurphy and the Chief wait their turn, McMurphy offers Chief a piece of gum, and Chief murmurs 'Thank you'. McMurphy is delighted to find Bromden is neither deaf nor mute, and stays silent to deflect attention. After the electroshock therapy, McMurphy shuffles back onto the ward feigning illness, before humorously animating his face and loudly greeting his fellow patients, assuring everyone that the Etc only charged him up all the more and that the next woman to take him on will 'light up like a pinball machine and pay off in silver dollars.'But the struggle with Ratched is taking its toll, and with his release date no longer a certainty, McMurphy plans an escape. He phones Candy to bring her friend Rose (Louisa Moritz) and some booze to the hospital late one night. They enter through a window after McMurphy bribes the night orderly, Mr. Turkle (Scatman Crothers). McMurphy and Candy invite the patients into the day room for a party; the group breaks into the drug locker, puts on music, and enjoys a bacchanalian rampage. At the end of the night, McMurphy and Bromden prepare to climb out the window with the girls. McMurphy says goodbye to everyone, and invites an emotional Billy to escape with them; he declines, saying he is not yet ready to leave the hospital—though he would like to date Candy in the future. McMurphy insists Billy have sex with Candy right then and there, and Billy (and Candy) agree. They retire to a private room. The effects of the alcohol and pilfered medication take their toll on everyone, including McMurphy and the Chief, whose eyes slowly close in fatigue.Nurse Ratched arrives the next morning and discovers the scene: the ward completely upended and patients passed out all over the floor. She orders the attendants to lock the window, clean up, and conduct a head count. When they find Billy and Candy, the other patients applaud and, buoyed, Billy speaks for the first time without a stutter. Nurse Ratched then announces that she will tell Billy's mother what he has done. Billy panics, his stutter returns, and he starts punching himself in the groin; locked in the doctor's office, he kills himself. McMurphy, enraged at Nurse Ratched, chokes her nearly to death until orderly Washington knocks him out.Some time later, the patients in the ward play cards and gamble for cigarettes as before, only now with Harding dealing and delivering a pale imitation of McMurphy's patter. Nurse Ratched, still recovering from the neck injury sustained during McMurphy's attack, wears a neck brace and speaks in a thin, reedy voice. The patients pass a whispered rumor that McMurphy dramatically escaped the hospital rather than being taken 'upstairs'.Late that night, Chief Bromden sees McMurphy being escorted back to his bed, and initially believes that he has returned so they can escape together—which he is now ready to do since McMurphy has made him feel 'as big as a mountain'. However, when he looks closely at McMurphy's unresponsive face, he is horrified to see lobotomy scars on his forehead. Unwilling to allow McMurphy to live in such a state—or be seen this way by the other patients—the Chief smothers McMurphy to death with his pillow. He then carries out McMurphy's escape plan by lifting the hydrotherapy console off the floor and hurling the massive fixture through a grated window, climbing through and running off into the distance.Verdict: overall the novel is BETTER than the film. But for Jack Nicholson fans (like me) this is a must! I thought Jack's performance in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining was his best performance ever.",Null,0,3,15 August 2011
Edge of Tomorrow," Absolutely Riveting.
","My favorite actor Tom Cruise(Cocktail 1988) is in his element here. A superb and believable performance by him, proves that in other film where he has not performed well, the script and director were to be blamed.The film based on a screenplay adapted from the 2004 Japanese light novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. The plot device of the film is a time-loop, where an event happens over and over again.Plot: In the near future, a race of space aliens called Mimics has taken over continental Europe. In England, General Brigham, head of humanity's United Defense Force, orders Major William Cage, a public affairs officer and former advertising executive, to cover combat on the beaches of France during the next day's assault on the Mimics. Cage objects to the dangerous assignment and threatens to use his public relations skills to turn the public against Brigham when the casualties start increasing from the invasion. General Brigham has Cage arrested; Cage is knocked out during an ensuing escape attempt. He wakes in handcuffs at a forward operating base at Heathrow Airport and discovers he has been labeled a deserter and put on combat duty for the invasion under the command of Master Sergeant Farell.The invasion is a disaster for the humans. Cage manages to kill a large Mimic but dies as he is sprayed with its acid-like blood. He then wakes up at Heathrow the previous morning. No one believes his story that he knows the invasion will fail. He repeats the loop of dying on the beach and waking at Heathrow over and over many times until he encounters Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) during the invasion on the beach. She recognizes his ability to anticipate events and tells him to locate her the next time he 'wakes up'.Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: one for your DVD/BLURAY collection. Absolutely breathtaking C.G.I.

Bram Stoker's Dracula," Highly paced and special-effects extravaganza of Bram Stoker's eternal classic.
","The brilliant Mr. F.F Coppola (The Godfather, Apocalypse Now) directs an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.He wisely sets the pace as a good one omitting unnecessary dialogues and scenes. He decides to dazzle our eyes by providing a visual feast of special effects.The casting is good too. With veteran actors like Gary Oldman as Count Dracula and Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing what could go possibly go wrong? Also as a bonus: the handsome Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker and the sexy Winona Ryder as Mina and Elisabeta.Now for the story. It is a love story as well as a horror story.In 1462, Vlad Dracula (Gary Oldman), a member of the Order of the Dragon, returns from a victory against the Turks to find his wife Elisabeta (Winona Ryder) had committed suicide after hearing false reports of his death. Enraged at the notion of his wife being eternally damned as a suicide, Dracula desecrates his chapel and renounces God, declaring that he will rise from the grave to avenge Elisabeta with all the powers of darkness.In 1897, law clerk Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) takes the Transylvanian Count Dracula over as a client from his colleague R.M. Renfield (Tom Waits), who has gone insane. Jonathan travels to Transylvania to arrange the formalities of Dracula's real estate acquisition in London, including Carfax Abbey. Jonathan meets Dracula, a wrinkled, pale old man (Oldman) inhabiting a bizarre castle. During the signing of the papers, the Count discovers a picture of Harker's fiancée, Mina (Ryder), and is astonished to find that she is the reincarnation of Elisabeta. Dracula leaves Jonathan to be seduced by his brides (Monica Bellucci, Michaela Bercu, and Florina Kendrick) and sails to England with boxes of his native soil, taking up residence at Carfax Abbey. His arrival is foretold by the ravings of Renfield, now an inmate in Dr. Jack Seward's (Richard E. Grant) neighboring lunatic asylum.In London, Dracula emerges as a werewolf-like creature amid a fierce thunderstorm and hypnotically seduces, then rapes and bites, Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost), with whom Mina is staying while Jonathan is in Transylvania. Lucy's deteriorating health and behavioral changes prompts Lucy's former love-interests Quincey Morris (Billy Campbell) and Dr. Seward, along with her fiancée, Arthur Holmwood (Cary Elwes), to summon Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), who during a blood transfusion recognizes Lucy as the victim of a vampire. Dracula, now young and handsome, meets and charms Mina. However, when Mina gets word from Jonathan, who has escaped the castle and recovered at a convent, she travels to Hungary to marry him. In his heartbroken fury, Dracula transforms Lucy into a vampire. Van Helsing, Holmwood, Seward, and Morris kill Lucy to stop her undead suffering, and save her from eternal damnation.As Jonathan and Mina return to London, Jonathan and Van Helsing lead the others to Carfax Abbey, where they destroy the Count's boxes of soil. Dracula enters the asylum, where he kills Renfield for warning Mina of his presence, and visits Mina, who is staying in Seward's quarters while the others hunt Dracula. Dracula confesses that he murdered Lucy and has been terrorizing Mina's friends, but a confused and angry Mina admits that she still loves him and now remembers her old life as Elisabeta. At her insistence, Dracula begins to transform her into a vampire. The vampire hunters burst into the bedroom, with Dracula claiming Mina as his bride before escaping by changing into thousands of rats. As Mina begins changing the same way Lucy had, Van Helsing hypnotizes her and learns via her connection with Dracula that he is sailing home in his last remaining box. The Hunters depart for the port of Varna to intercept him, but Dracula reads Mina's mind and evades them. The Hunters split up, with Van Helsing and Mina traveling to the Borgo Pass and the Castle, while the others try to stop the Gypsies transporting the Count.At night, Van Helsing and Mina are approached by Dracula's brides. They frighten Mina at first, but she gives into their chanting and attempts to seduce Van Helsing. Before Mina can feed on his blood he places a communion wafer upon her forehead, leaving a mark. He proceeds to surround them with a ring of fire to protect them from the brides. In the morning, he infiltrates the castle and decapitates them. As sunset approaches, Dracula's carriage appears on the horizon, pursued by the hunters, and arrives at the castle. A fight between the hunters and gypsies ensues and at sunset Dracula bursts from his coffin. Harker slits his throat while a wounded Morris stabs him in the heart. As Dracula staggers, Mina rushes to his defense. Holmwood tries to attack but Van Helsing and Harker allow her to retreat with the Count, turning instead to Morris, who dies surrounded by his friends.In the same chapel where he renounced God centuries earlier, Dracula lies dying, now in an ancient demonic form. He asks Mina to give him peace, by stabbing the sword through his heart. They share a final kiss, as the candles adorning the chapel miraculously light in God's presence, and the hole in the cross heals itself. Mina shoves the knife through his heart. The mark on her forehead disappears as Dracula's curse is lifted, as well as Elisabeta's soul. She then decapitates him and gazes up at the fresco of Vlad and Elisabeta ascending to Heaven together. Mina is then finally free.Actors of note: Gary Oldman is OUTSTANDING as the portrayal of Dracula. Along with Winona Ryder playing both as Elisabeta and Mina. Anothony Hopkins needs no introduction and he plays his part effectively. Keanu Reeves is disappointing as he has a small part in the movie.Overall a must have for your DVD collection. Overall 10/10 a visual Masterpiece.",10,0,2,26 October 2010
Arrival," Under The Shadow Of Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) .
","This film is so bad it makes Independence Day: Resurgence (2016) look good. No doubt some of the special effects make this film unique, but there is lack of suspense and overall thrill. This film also fails as a sci-fi action flick. I don't want to go into details about the aliens portrayed in the film- that will spoil it for you if you haven't yet seen the film.The film starts in flash back about a mother, Louise Banks(Amy Adams) remembering the birth of her daughter. The memories progress till the daughter is a teenager. Then we see that her daughter has contracted a terrible and disease, a form of cancer and she is on her death bed wearing a ventilator mask. She dies.Then a flashback to the beginning when all was well and the words 'Come back to me,' uttered by her mother.Sometime after, twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft appear across the Earth. Louise, who is a linguist is asked by US Army Colonel Weber(Forest Whitaker) to join a team to find out why they have come. You will have to see the film to find out what happens next.The film also stars Jeremy Renner alongside Amy Adams. Renner's career has seen him rise from obscurity to one of the most well paid actors in the movie industry. Forrest Whittaker who won the Academy Award, for his role as the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, makes a lackluster presence in the film. So does Jeremy Renner. The main role of the film is of Amy Adams. Though she is a capable actress, I fill the dull script lets her down.The special effects of the film rapidly become stereotypical and boring. You can compare this film with the Jodie Foster film Contact(1997). I find Contact is a better film, and more so script-wise. The sound-effects of the film are decent but not spectacular. The photography is well handled as well as the direction. The film is directed by Denis Villeneuve. It based on the short story 'Story of Your Life' by Ted Chiang. Villeneuve has previously directed the thriller Prisoners(2013) and the action-thriller Sicario(2015). Thank you for reading my review may you live long and prosper.More alien encounter films to see: Invasion of the Body Snatchers(1978), Alien(1979), The Thing(1982), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Xtro (1982), Lifeforce (1985), Invaders from Mars (1986), The Blob (1988 film), Killer Klowns from Outer Space(1988), Mac and Me (1988), Communion (1989), Metamorphosis: The Alien Factor (1990), Shadowzone(1990), Fire in the Sky (1993).There are so many more movies but I can't write them all. These above are a good guide.",3,2,7,6 December 2016

","Dear me. After watching this guy's horrendously bad film Insidious(2010) you'd expect him to pull up his socks and do better. But no. Whether this guys become lazy and unambitious or smoking weed etc., etc.The plot is the same like in every possessed house film. Family moves into house. Family stumbles upon and awakens evil entity. Evil entity lays siege to family. Family calls in paranoobs. Paranoobs help family to either (a)truce with entity (b)defeat & banish entity or (c)Family+Paranoobs are destroyed.Take your pick.

Prometheus," The Most Horrendous Casting I Have Seen In Years.
","The persons that did the casting (Nina Gold and Avy Kaufman) should have their licenses revoked. These are the most horrendous bunch of buggers(I don't even want to call them actors) ever assembled.This film began as an idea for a prequel to the 1979 cult sci-fi horror film Alien directed by Ridley Scott. But sadly it de-evolved into a standalone film.Prometheus is a Titan, culture hero, and trickster figure who in Greek mythology is credited with the creation of man from clay and the theft of fire for human use, an act that enabled progress and civilization. He is known for his intelligence, and as a champion of humanity. In this film Prometheus is the name of the space-ship used to reach the distant moon LV-223. In Aliens(1986) the planet where Lt. Ripley first encountered the alien organism was LV-426. Hence we now confirm that Prometheus is a stand-alone film and NOT CONNECTED TO Alien(1979) and Aliens(1986) in any way whatsoever.In Prometheus writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof conceived of large humanoid alien beings nicknamed 'Engineers' who initiated the process of life on the planet we know as 'Earth'. This was accomplished by the humanoid alien drinking a dark bubbling liquid while standing next to a large waterfall. He then starts to disintegrate due to the ingestion of the dark liquid. The alien's remains cascade into a waterfall. His DNA triggers a biogenetic reaction creating living cells in the water.This stuff is enough to send a biologist or molecular biologist to a fit of hysterical laughter. Of course you realize these guys have no primary or secondary education at all. They never studied biology or chemistry. They are what you refer as flunkies or junkies or the combo.Years later in 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a star map in Scotland that matches others from several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the 'Engineers'. Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds an expedition to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223 aboard the scientific vessel Prometheus. The ship's crew travels in stasis while the android David monitors their voyage. Arriving in 2093, they are informed of their mission to find the Engineers.The special effects are higher class of C.G.I. developed for people who have sharp eyesight and can spot the fake computerized pixels a mile away. These days even PS3 games have better graphics than shown in movies. The C.G.I. effects are used for the Engineers and the few mutated snake-like alien creatures. The biggest of which strangely developed inside Elizabeth Shaw. And at the end of the film we see an alien creature emerging out from an Engineer which resembles the alien we saw in Scott's first alien film and is a poor attempt at pacifying die-hard Alien(1979) fans.The acting is unbearable with Michael Fassbender (who remarkably looks like Peter O Toole) as the only bright spot in the film followed by veteran actor Guy Pearce(Memento, Time Machine, Lockout, Ravenous) who plays the role of Peter Weyland, the billionaire founder of and CEO of Weyland Corp.Charlize Theron is utterly useless in her role. Even a lesser actress like Noomi Rapace outperforms her.Idriss Elba tries in his role as captain of the Prometheus but is ineffective (this guy couldn't even captain a kids football team).The rest of the actors are like a mix of various colored turds in the manure and do not deserve mention.Overall: it was not worth the wait for me and was a big disappointment. I was expecting Alien PREQUEL and not the Alien which lives in Ridley Scott's a**.",4,5,7,27 December 2012
Halloween," To Each Man His Own Meat....
","I saw this film for the first time in 2008 having missed a chance to see it in my youth in the late eighties. Seeing the very high rating this film gets you might be tricked into watching it. After watching the film you might think to yourself quietly: what was all the fuss about? Clearly this film is inspired from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho which was based on the crimes of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein.Halloween is a 1978 American independent horror film directed, produced, and scored by John Carpenter, co-written with Debra Hill, and starring Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis in her film debut.The film is set in the fictional midwestern town of Haddonfield, Illinois. On Halloween, six year old Michael Myers murders his older sister. Fifteen years later, he escapes from a psychiatric hospital, returns home, and stalks teenager Laurie Strode and her friends. Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis suspects Michael's intentions, and follows him to Haddonfield to try to prevent this from happening.Halloween spawned seven sequels, a 2007 remake of the same name and directed by Rob Zombie — and a 2009 sequel to the remake, Halloween II, which is unrelated to the sequel of the original.List Of Sequels: Halloween II (1981), Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988), Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989), Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995), Halloween: Resurrection (2002).Remakes: Halloween (2007) and Halloween II (2009 and is unrelated to the 1981 film of the same name).Verdict: Jason or Michael Myers? (Or even Freddy Krueger for that matter) Whom to choose??? Of course its JASON WITH A CAPITAL J!!! Sorry Michael YOU LOOSE!!! Bye :)",3,3,7,14 January 2011
Back to the Future Part II," Better and visually superior than the first.
","Hard-working Robert Zemeckis proves himself yet again. I consider him the greatest director of all time, even better than Spielberg.Continues where the first one left off.Doc Brown tells Marty McFly that he must go back to future to prevent his son from being an accomplice to a robbery. The plan is to pose as his son and say no to Griff Tannen (grandson to Biff Tannen).Unfortunately, things get worse when the almanac Marty buys at an antique store falls into the hands of Biff. Biff sneaks into the time machine and travels back in time to his younger self in 1955 and hands him the almanac and warns him of a visit from Marty and to keep the almanac in a safe.Marty returns back to his time in 1985 and is horrified that it has been altered by Biff.Will Marty be able to recover the almanac from Biff and restore time as it was before? Watch the film to find out how.Heart-thumping background musical score, excellent photography and special-effects, and an interesting plot make the sequel even better than the original.",Null,0,1,8 June 2010
1408," Mikael Håfström's masterpiece, and the film he will be forever remembered for in years to come.
","This film has my vote for best horror film of 2007. This is also actor John Cusack's best film and deserves and Oscar for his performance.This film scared the living daylights out of me. I have never been scared of any horror film as I have been with this one. I strongly recommend you not to watch it alone and not at night!The excellent and flawless script coupled with Håfström's style of direction, make this film the best horror film of 2007. Based on Stephen King's short story of the same name, the film follows Mike Enslin (John Cusack), an author who specializes in the horror genre. Mike's career is essentially based on investigating allegedly haunted houses, although his repeatedly unfruitful studies have left him disillusioned and pessimistic. Through an anonymous warning (via postcard), Mike eventually learns of the Dolphin Hotel in New York City, which houses the infamous 'Room 1408'. Interested yet skeptical, Mike decides to spend one night in the hotel although manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) warns him strongly against it. Mike has a series of bizarre experiences in the room.What happens next has to be seen to be believed!This film has two different endings. So I recommend you buy the DVD version with the extras.",Null,0,0,1 May 2011
The Woman in Black," This isn't the first remake by HAMMER, and it certainly won't be the LAST.
","This is a remake of the 1989 made for TV film which was adapted by Nigel Kneale from Susan Hill's Novel of the same name.This film involves the ghost of a woman which haunts Eel Marsh House. The local villagers say that when anyone espies her, trouble will befall in the form of the death of a young child (or children).Enter Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe a.k.a. Harry-likes-to-go-potty!) young solicitor who lost his wife during the birth of his son. He is now raising his boy with the help of a nanny.He is assigned to handle the estate of Alice Drablow, who owned an English manor known as the Eel Marsh House, where she had lived with her husband, son Nathaniel, and sister Jennet Humfrye (Liz White). At Eel Marsh House, located on an island in the marshes, Kipps repeatedly hears footsteps and sees a woman dressed in black. From then onwards, events occur that finally helps him to unravel the mystery of the woman in black.Overall this is the sort of movie which will try scare you with its sound-effects. Visual effects are as usual C.G.I. imagery. But if you have watched films like The Grudge and The Ring, this film will be nothing new to you. Bottom line: an average horror film and some even say the 1989 film was better.I am seeing in my minds eye a lot of top Japanese, Korean and Chinese horror film directors laughing their asses off! Well in closing: DEAR HAMMER FILMS, CONTINUE MAKE PLENTY OF 'DUMB' REMAKES TILL YOU HOPEFULLY WIN AN Oscar OR A BAFTA. GOOD LUCK CHUMS!",5,0,1,8 April 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Was This Film Made To Boost The Career Of That Gold-digger Jodie Foster?
","I wonder....I see Jodie Foster so many times in the film, to the point that her presence begins to really annoy me. The real star of the film is Ted Levine who didn't win anything at all. All the hard work he put into the character of Jamie Gumb a.k.a. Buffalo Bill went to waste. In short Ted Levine was robbed blind.His portrayal of the character is very realistic. When he expresses his anguish and frustration to Catherine Martin that is the greatest scene in the film. Another scene is where he is in the nude and showing of his dress, wearing lipstick and blush and exclaiming,'I'd f*ck me! I'd f*ck me really hard!' The background score to the scene is also excellent.The other star is of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. But his characterization is dangerously misleading. Cannibals are passive. They never show emotion or anger and are quite normal-looking. It is this trait that enables them to fool their unsuspecting victim. In Michael Mann's film Manhunter, Brian Cox played Dr. Hannibal Lecktor beautifully. He was exceedingly soft spoken and polite. His victims were beautiful women who lured with his CHARM.Now Anthony Hopkins portrayed his version as rude, arrogant and psychotic. Any Hollywood actor could perform what Hopkins did in the film. Take for example actors: Jack Nicholson, W. Forsythe, Brian Dennehy, Willem Dafoe, Ed Harris etc. The list is endless....The reason why the film succeeds is mainly due to the clever direction by Jonathan Demme, photography By Tak Fujimoto and excellent music by Howard Shore. With these three in combination anything is possible.List Of Serial Killer Movies: Manhunter(based on Red Dragon) 1986, To Catch A Killer 1992 TV, Dahmer (2002), The Secret Life of Jeffrey Dahmer (1993), The Gray Man (2007), Resurrection (1999), Bone Daddy (1997), Albert Fish (2007), Marian Dora's Cannibal (2005), Deranged (1974), Jack The Ripper, Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer (1986), and H.

The Wolverine," What's the difference between a Japanese Geisha and The Wolverine?
","Well the Geisha loves to eat sushi, while The Wolverine can make sushi out the Geisha girl(LOL).Now that the jokes over, lets get on with the review. Having seen the previous X-men Origins: Wolverine 2009 film, I expected this one to be some notches better. Nope, that was no to be. Bitterly disappointed. The film is set in the country of Japan. X-men is a U.S. franchise, so whats the idea behind a Japanese setting? Maybe the Japanese are biggest buyers of U.S. anime and comic books(?) Well if that's the case....The film opens in 1945. Wolverine is held in a Japanese POW camp near Nagasaki. During the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Logan rescues a Japanese officer named Yashida and shields him from the blast. Yashida repays the favor by helping Wolverine escape from Japan.Years later in the present day, Yashida wishes to see Wolverine again and so he sends Yukio, a mutant with the precognitive ability to foresee people's deaths, to fetch him. Wolverine refuses to go at first, but then reluctantly agrees to go possibly because Yashida helped him escape from Japan. The rest of the film moves to Japan till its conclusion. I'm a fan of Hugh Jackman since the X-Men Trilogy of films days. Those films were the cream of the crop, because they starred established Hollywood actors the likes of: Ian Mckellen, Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen etc., etc. Also good script, plot and setting for the film. This film feels like it does no belong in the X-men universe. And even Hugh Jackman cannot rescue the film, because of the bogus plot and horrible supporting cast of actors. Even the special effects in the film are mediocre, compared to films like The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-man which I enjoyed immensely.Verdict: if you expect this film to be better than the X-Men films you are in for a big disappointed. If you want to kill some time, why not watch it for free online.",3,1,3,18 January 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," A Conclusion To The Batman Series.
","The newest chapter of the Batman film franchise: The Dark Knight Rises, has Batman facing his nemesis Bane. Bane was trained by Ras Al Ghul who we fist saw in Batman Begins. Ras Al Ghul who was the leader of a Secret Society called the 'League Of Shadows' had a mission to destroy the city of Gotham. When he was slain by Batman, the mission then ultimately fell into the hands of Bane.Bane makes his entry into the film in the opening scenes of the film where he captures nuclear physicist Dr. Pavel. We later learn that Dr. Pavel had designed a fusion reactor for Wayne Enterprises. This fusion reactor could also be used by a terrorist(Bane) as a fully primed neutron bomb.To cut things short, Bane captures the fusion reactor and it is up to Batman to save the day. Verdict: I am NOT a Christian Bale fan but I respected Christopher Nolan's ability as a director in the film Memento (2000) and also Insomnia (2002). Thus it is proved that this guy is good in the THRILLER/MURDER-SUSPENSE department. I also enjoyed The Dark Knight (2002) because of the awesome performance by the late Heath Ledger(1979 -2008) who in fact was the reason I felt the film owed its success to. This film introduces a new super-heroine to the scene: Selina Kyle a.k.a. Catwoman played by Anne Hathaway. She assists Batman in the late part of the film to thwart Bane and Co. She also saves Batman's life when Bane is just about to kill him. Hathaway trained specially for this role.Morgan Freeman reprises his role as Lucius Fox as does Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth and my favorite actor Gary Oldman as Commissioner James Gordon. These seasoned veterans do their part in the film. I particularly like Michael Caine's acting in the film in the part where he implores Bruce Wayne to settle down with a wife and have a child and forget Batman for good. Gary Oldman's character is always in some sort of internal conflict of morality. Morgan Freemam's acting is effortless as usual and it was really good to see him in good health in the film. Morgan is now 75 years old.Bane is played by actor Tom Hardy whom we also saw in the film Star Trek Nemesis. In the film his face is covered by mask all the time so we never see his real face in the film.Also for the first time in this film we see the 'Bat', a variation of the Batplane. Verdict: C.G.I. special effects nowadays are basically used in all Hollywood action movies. Take for example films like Transformers Series and the new Ridley Scott film Prometheus. I felt The Dark Knight 2008 had better effects. Acting was normal and nothing special. The amount these guys are getting paid is outrageous than their mediocre acting capability. The casting is decent though. The script and dialogue was also well polished.The climax was highly predictable and unworthy and it is here that I find the biggest fault. The fight between Bane and Batman was a joke. Batman was saved by a woman is a bigger joke. The fact that we see Batman and Selina Kyle enjoying themselves in Florence put the last nail in the coffin for me. I don't believe Batman and Catwoman have anything in common apart from tight-fitting black leather costumes. So there you have it: a generous score of 6/10.

","This new installment, the continuing second part of the Creed saga follows newly crowned heavyweight champion Adonis Creed defending his title against the son of the man that killed his father.This is the main plot device of the film, but very poorly executed.
We see characters from Rocky IV returning, Dolph Lundgren and Brigitte Nielsen who has aged badly.The film is more of an emotional drama film than an action-packed feature. I found the training and boxing choreography very substandard. Cinematography is excellent - the director of photography Kramer Morgenthau did his job well. Also music in the film is well handled by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson. All the actors play their part but the main actors are ill used. Dolph Lundgren and Bridgette Neilsen are not given enough screen time. Also I don't like the actor they chose to be the son of Drago - he looks nothing like him.The script is the dullest part. This is a two hour film and one you would never see twice. Even though Michael B. Jordan gives his best here, the overall fight scenes of the movie does not live up to the high expectations of fans of Rocky.",5,0,1,21 February 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," For Me, This Film Failed On Many Aspects.
","The cast is terrible. The plot of the film goes nowhere. The emphasis on C.G.I. is just to make up for the weak plot. Let me say beforehand that I'm not a Ben Affleck fan, nor a Henry Cavill admirer. At least I can tolerate Cavill's performance. I just don't consider these two people as actors. Sir Richard Burton, Sir Anthony Hopkins, David Suchet, Sir Laurence Olivier, Marlon Brando, Vincent Price, Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Gene Hackman, Gary Oldman, Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Ben Kingsley, Peter Sellars, Charlton Heston, Burt Lancaster, Robert Duvall and Kirk Douglas.These above are legends. I don't want to go into more detail. Then I'd be adding Lance Henriksen, Michael Biehn, Armand Asante, Rutger Hauer all of who are the stuff of cult movies. This new crop of actors, you can say new generation of actors, can't compare with the predecessors.Back to the film. The film concerns Lex Luther's obsession to make Superman his slave. This is done in two ways: (1)by making Batman his enemy, (2)obtaining a sample of DNA from a Kryptonian survivor and thereby cloning a meta-human.Superman doesn't want Batman interfering in his actions so automatically the tensions run high between them. We see the first appearance of Israeli actress Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Also veteran actor Jeremy Irons takes over from Sir Michael Caine as Batman's Butler and right-hand man Alfred Pennyworth.When watching a film of this caliber, I am not bothered with special effects. Since I grew up in the Lucas, Spielberg, Cameron, Scott, McTiernan, Verhoeven era. I am not a newbie to special effects, I grew up on them. The plot is the core of the film. If the plot is superb, even bad actors will shine. Also you need a superb musical background score which will get the adrenaline going. You need gifted guys like Alan Silvestri, James Horner, Jerry Goldsmith, Danny Elfman, Christopher Young, Mark Isham, Vangelis and a great favorite of mine: Brad Fiedel. The golden age of Hollywood has gone, the automaton of generic rehashed films is now.",3,2,8,7 July 2016
Cinderella," One Of The Finest Animation Techniques I Have Ever Seen, Make This My All Time Favorite Disney Film.
","Simply put: a masterpiece that will endure the tides of time. A fitting tribute to children all over the world by the hard-working animators that brought life to the colorful characters in the film.Even adults will enjoy this film. Cinderella, or The Little Glass Slipper (Italian: Cenerentola, French: Cendrillon ou La Petite Pantoufle de verre, German: Aschenputtel), is an Italian folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust oppression. The first written version was published in Napoli (Naples) by Giambattista Basile, in his Pentamerone (1634). The story itself was based in the Kingdom of Naples, at that time the most important political and cultural center of Southern Italy and among the most influential capitals in Europe, and written in the Neapolitan dialect. It was later reprised, along with other Basile's tales, by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou contes du temps passé (1697), and by the Brothers Grimm in their folk tale collection Grimms' Fairy Tales (1812). One of the most popular versions of Cinderella was written in French by Charles Perrault in 1697, under the name Cendrillon. The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the pumpkin, the fairy-godmother and the introduction of glass slippers.Plot: In a far away, long ago kingdom, Cinderella is living happily with her mother and father until her mother dies. Cinderella's father remarries a cold, cruel woman who has two daughters, Drizella and Anastasia. When the father dies, Cinderella's wicked stepmother turns her into a virtual servant in her own house. Meanwhile, across town in the castle, the King determines that his son the Prince should find a suitable bride and provide him with a required number of grandchildren. So the King invites every eligible maiden in the kingdom to a fancy dress ball, where his son will be able to choose his bride. Cinderella has no suitable party dress for a ball, but her friends the mice, led by Jaques and Gus, and the birds lend a hand in making her one, a dress the evil stepsisters immediately tear apart on the evening of the ball. As they depart for the ball, Cinderella is left behind. She goes outside and starts to weep, when suddenly a soft hand caresses her shoulder and she looks behind. She sees an elderly woman with a kind face who professes to be her fairy godmother. She immediately began to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turned a pumpkin into a golden carriage, mice into horses, a rat into a coachman, and lizards into footmen. She then turned Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Godmother told her to enjoy the ball, but warned that she had to return before midnight, when the spells would be broken. Watch this timeless classic to see what happens next...This animated film is based on Perrault's version of the tale. You immediately notice that the animation is very pleasant for the eyes, and the colors are rich and vibrant. The backgrounds and attention to detail is meticulous. The plot and script is well polished and perfectly adapted from Perrault's tale. Then we move on to the sound effects of the animated film. Again, excellence in the voice-acting, background themes and the few songs that occur in the film are very melodious. All the characters in the film are well portrayed and will linger in your memory long after you have watched the film.Other Walt Disney Classics: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio(1940), Dumbo (1941), Bambi(1942), Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan(1953), Lady And The Tramp 1955, Sleeping Beauty (1959), The Sword in the Stone (1963), The Jungle Book (1967), The AristoCats (1970), Robin Hood (1973), The Rescuers (1977), The Fox and the Hound (1981).",10,1,2,14 June 2015
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Wes Craven had this 'Nightmare' while eating some undercooked beans and then falling asleep.
","Not a masterpiece by any rate. But it comes close to it. Craven produced A Nightmare on Elm Street on an estimated budget of just $1.8 million, a sum the film earned back during its first week. An instant commercial success, the film's total United States box office gross is $25.5 million.The film is credited with carrying on many clichés found in low-budget horror films of the 1970s and 1980s, originating in John Carpenter's 1978 horror film Halloween, including the morality play that revolves around sexual promiscuity in teenagers resulting in their eventual (usually graphic) death, leading to the term 'slasher film'.Critics and film historians argue that the film's premise is the question of the distinction between dreams and reality, which is manifested in the film through the teenagers' dreams and their realities. Critics today praise the film's ability to transgress 'the boundaries between the imaginary and real', toying with audience perceptions.Plot(for kids only): Krueger is a child murderer who killed at least twenty children over a decade before the film takes place. Furious, vengeful parents burned him alive in his boiler room hideout when he was released from prison on a technicality. Now, it appears he is manipulating the dreams of their children to exact his revenge from beyond the grave. (Are you scared now kids ?!) Meet the kids: Nancy Thompson(Heather Langenkamp), Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp) Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss) and Rod Lane (Nick Corri). Of the four only Nancy apparently survives the battle with Freddy. However Nancy dies in the 3rd installment of the film A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 3: The Dream Warriors.Gore review: just about enough to fill your tummy halfway. Where's the rest?! Apparently its in the hands of Wes Craven. Come on! Dish it out Wes!Those of you left unsatisfied with this film can watch The Exorcist 1,2,3 and then if still unsatisfied can jump from a 100ft. building screaming 'I can fly! I can fly....oh sh*t....I can't fly!!! What the hell ?! Arrrrgh!!!' Splatt!!!I really enjoy writing these reviews for you.

Godzilla," In all honesty, the 1998 film was better.
","The 1998 film had a better director, writer, and special effects technician. I am taking about Ronald Emmerich, Dean Devlin and Patrick Tatopolous. This team has worked on hits like Universal Soldier, Stargate and Independence Day. This film had seasoned actors Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno who could carry any film by themselves.The 2014 film is directed by Gareth Edwards who is not seasoned enough to handle such a big project. The writer Dave Callaham writes a dull story and thus the screenplay written by Max Borenstein is ineffective. Bryan Cranston(of Breaking Bad TV series fame) is the only good actor in the film. But he has a short role in the film.The film does not continue from the 1997 film, but is a standalone film.The plot hinges around Project Monarch scientists Ishiro Serizawa and Vivienne Graham investigate a colossal skeleton in a collapsed mine in the Philippines. They find two egg-shaped pods; one dormant, one broken open. The hatched creature burrows under Janjira Nuclear Power Plant and causes a seismic effect as it feeds on the reactor's radiation. Joe Brody(Bryan Cranston), the plant's supervisor, sends his wife Sandra and a team of technicians into the reactor. While the team is inside, the reactor is breached, releasing radioactive steam. Sandra and her team are unable to escape and the plant collapses into ruin.Fifteen years later, Joe's son Ford is a US Navy explosive ordinance disposal officer, living in San Francisco with his wife Elle and son Sam. After Joe is detained for trespassing in the Janjira quarantine zone, Ford returns to Japan. Convinced of a cover-up of the cause of the disaster, Joe convinces Ford to help him retrieve vital data at their old home.Watch film to find out what happens next.The core of this film hinges on the C.G.I.(Computer Generated Imagery) special effects and no attention is given to the unbelievably ridiculous plot, which you have to see to believe. If the trio of Emmerich, Devlin and Tatopoulos had begin given this project, then the result would have been much better.Verdict: Just watch once and forget about it. This film will be forgotten in years to come among the many trash films produced by the United States film industry.You may like: Gozilla 1954, Godzilla King Of The Monsters! 1956, Godzilla 1985.",6,2,4,28 August 2014
Life," A sci-fi-horror film set in deep space. I also recommend you see Europa Report (2013) and Harbinger Down (2015).
","This film is a hybrid of Alien 1979 and The Thing 1982. In short, this is a 'creature' film.This film casts two well known male actors Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal. I think this is the first time these actors have acted together in the same film. The female actresses in the film are Rebecca Ferguson and Olga Yuryevna Dihovichnay. The rest of the cast are experienced actors Ariyon Bakare and Hiroyuki Sanada.Plot: six-member International Space Station (ISS) crew capture a probe returning from Mars with a soil sample that might contain evidence of extraterrestrial life. Exobiologist Hugh Derry(Ariyon Bakare) revives a dormant cell from the sample, and it quickly grows into a multi-celled organism that American school children name 'Calvin'. After an atmospheric accident in the lab, Calvin becomes dormant.If you have seen The Thing 1982 and The Alien Trilogy of films, this film will appeal to you in the sense of sci-fi horror coupled with intense action scenes. The background music effects are also superb as is the cinematography. Swedish director Jorge Daniel Espinosa directs his first full length U.S. feature film and he does so professionally. Also those of you who like surprise endings will not be disappointed.Thanks for reading my review, may you lead a full and happy life and proper.More creature films: Lifeforce(1985), Star Crystal(1986), Moontrap(1989 stars Walter Koenig of Star Trek fame), The Dark Side of the Moon(1990), Critters 4(1992), Pitch Black(2000).I have seen tons of films in my life most of them sci-fi horror, sad to say I can't remember all of them. These above films are a good guide into the genre. I also recommend you see Nightflyers(1987) based on the novella by George R.R. Martin.",7,5,12,15 April 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Very Entertaining Movie.
","Over the years I have seen many spy-thrillers. The more obvious being the James Bond films based upon the Ian Fleming novels. Each James Bond film has a unique maniacal villain with world domination as his main agenda.This film is no different. Here we have internet billionaire Richmond Valentine(Samuel L. Jackson) who leads a paranoid and selfish existence. He believes the world is doomed by global warming - and the only solution is a worldwide cull. And so, he sets about his plans in gusto.Then we have hero of the film, young Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin(Taron Egerton) who leads a sad existence in the ghetto. The death of his father gives him an opportunity to join Kingsman, a secret intelligence agency that fights against terrorist threats.In the film we have the typical gadgets or gizmo's that your average agent needs. We also have the kill sequences similar to the Bond movies, however with updated C.G.I. effects in all their glory. The main factor that makes the film work is that the script is well polished, the action and acting is thoroughly controlled, the cinematography and sound-effects are superb. Some actors shine more than others, here we have Samuel Jackson and Colin Firth as one of the best. Mark Hamill has a small cameo as Professor James Arnold. I hardly recognized him at all. Just by looking at the end credits did I realize that he was in the film. Taron David Egerton makes a good leap from TV into mainstream Hollywood. Matthew Vaughan has made some good films in the past like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000) and directing the films Layer Cake (2004), Stardust (2007), Kick-Ass (2010), X-Men: First Class (2011). He has some similarity in style with other directors like Chris Nolan and Paul W.S. Anderson.Verdict: definitely a good way to pass one and a half hours. But I wouldn't watch the film again. Typical toilet paper film.

The Cabin in the Woods," A Grand Fusion Of Lovecraft And Clive Barker
","H.P. Lovecraft often referred to in his books about beings called the 'Elder Ones' which existed before man ever walked the Earth. He also mentioned an entity known as 'Cthulhu' whose name could not even be mentioned by humans as they did not possess the vocal anatomy needed. By fully canting this entity's name, it would be awoken from its primordial slumber and begin to devour all life. In this film the Elder Ones are called the 'Ancient Ones', and they have to be appeased from time to time by a ritualistic human sacrifice in order to prevent the destruction of the world. This film has some awesome special effects that has to be seen to be believed. The special effects are by AFX Studios, and close to a 140 people were working on these effects. The special effects really kick in during the last 35 minutes of the film, so if you want to skip to the special effects, just forward an hour of the film.The plot of the film closely resembles Sam Raimi's Evil dead film, but it ends up very differently. College students Dana Polk, Holden McCrea, Marty Mikalski, Jules Louden, and her boyfriend Curt Vaughan go to a remote cabin in the woods for a vacation. During the night, when they are partying, the cellar door unexpectedly opens and they all go in to explore. What happens next is for you to find out! The casting of the film is dubious, but the special effects more than make up for the dull cast. Chris Hemsworth the only notable actor is totally wasted(no pun intended!) in the film.

Lovecraft: From Beyond, The Dunwich Horror, Necronomicon: Book of Dead, Dagon, The Unnamable 1&2, Cool Air, Re-animator Trilogy, The Thing On The Doorstep & Dreams In The Witch House(Masters Of Horror TV Series Episode).Movies Based On Clive Barker Books: Hellraiser, Lord Of Illusion, Raw Head Rex, The Midnight Meat Train, Nightbreed, Candyman.",7,1,5,28 December 2012
Spectre," Mediocre Bond Film. Many Speculate That This Could Be His Last. Only Time Will Tell...
","Having grown up in the 80's Roger Moore James Bond era, I have since been an ardent fan of this enigmatic character full of courage and unflinching loyalty to the organization he serves.I have also seen all the Sean Connery Bond films of the 60-70 period and his last reprisal of the role in 1983 in the film Never Say Never Again. I consider Roger Moore the classiest(akin to royalty) James Bond, Sean Connery the most physically strong and the most humorous ever. The one liners by Sean Connery and even Moore are the stuff of legend.In the previous Bond movies we became aware of a sinister organization called SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion). Led by evil genius and supervillain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the international organization first formally appeared in the novel Thunderball (1961) and in the film Dr. No (1962). SPECTRE is not aligned to any nation or political ideology, enabling the later Bond books and Bond films to be regarded as somewhat apolitical though the former Gestapo members are a clear sign of Fleming's warning of the Nazi fascists surviving after the Second World War first detailed in the novel Moonraker (1954).Plot: Following Mallory's promotion to M, on a mission in Mexico City unofficially ordered by a posthumous message from the previous M, 007 James Bond kills three men plotting a terrorist bombing during the Day of the Dead and gives chase to Marco Sciarra, an assassin who survived the attack. In the ensuing struggle, Bond steals his ring, which is emblazoned with a stylised octopus, and then kills Sciarra by kicking him out of a helicopter. Upon returning to London, Bond is indefinitely suspended from field duty by M, who is in the midst of a power struggle with C, the head of the privately-backed Joint Intelligence Service, consisting of the recently merged MI5 and MI6. C campaigns for Britain to form alongside 8 other countries 'Nine Eyes ', a global surveillance and intelligence co-operation initiative between nine member states, and uses his influence to close down the '00' section, believing it to be outdated.What is the significance of the ring? Is agent C to be trusted? What is Bond's next move? See the film to find out what happens next.Verdict: acting wise Daniel Craig acts his usual. The only plus point is the villain of the film is really good. The stunts in the film are not extraordinary and I find that Mission Impossible Rogue Nation has better thrills than this film. Ralph Fiennes(Schindler's List (1993), Strange Days (1995), The End of the Affair (1999), Red Dragon (2002), The Constant Gardener (2005)) is a great favorite of mine, but the chemistry between him and Craig remains synonymous. The heroine in the film is French actress Léa Seydoux. Monica Bellucci(Under Suspicion 2000 a must see film) makes a very small appearance in the film.Thomas Newman who made music for such blockbuster films like Scent of a Woman(1992) and The Shawshank Redemption(1994) handles the music well. Hoyte van Hoytema is another experienced cinematographer who has worked in films like The Fighter(2010), Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy(2011) and Interstellar(2014).I think director Sam Mende's best film remains Road to Perdition (2002). In this film he doesn't shine at all.Thanks for reading my review, live long and prosper.P.S. Don't forget to collect all the Connery/Moore Bond films. Many can be downloaded from the internet for free using a BitTorrent client such as Utorrent/BitTorrent/Vuze/Tixati/Qbittorrent/Deluge/Baretorrent.Just type 'movie name' followed by 'torrent' in Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Firefox like: Dr. No 1962 torrent.

Mad Max: Fury Road," The Latest Film Has The Best Special Effects, But That's All. Mad Max 2 Is Still The Undisputed Champion.
","In 1979, George Miller directed a dystopian action film which earned US$100 million worldwide and held the Guinness record for most profitable film for decades. The film propelled Mel Gibson to an international cult figure called Max. This film Mad Max, was followed by two sequels, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome.I watched the sequel to Mad Max before I ever saw the original Mad Max. The original Mad Max can be considered a backdrop story to Mad Max 2. I think the original film was made just to launch the more serious chapter of the film which was the sequel. The concluding third chapter was generally considered a mediocre final chapter of the franchise and an average performer at the Box Office.The Human society is decimated by a nuclear holocaust and the few survivors fight over the meager resources, gasoline, food and water. Enter Max, a patrolman whose wife and toddler were literally run-over by vicious motorcycle gang and who is now just a 'shell of a human being' wandering aimlessly through the badlands...Miller's latest film Fury Road can be considered a continuation of events just after The Road Warrior and a prequel to Beyond Thunderdome. In fact, a character called Imperator Furiosa(Charlize Theron) is very similar to the Mad Max 3 character Aunty Entity(Tina Turner).Mel Gibson who played Max in all three of the films has been replaced by English Tom Hardy. This I find very offending. Mad Max is an Aussie franchise and should have stayed that way. Also the absence of Mel Gibson in the film is an open insult to Mad Max fans all over the world. The casting of South African actress Charlize Theron is the final slap on the face. Aren't there much prettier Aussie actresses to choose from? What about Nicole Kidman a veteran Aussie actress? Why was she not considered for this film? Plot: Max is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe(Hugh Keays-Byrne), and taken to Joe's Citadel. Designated a universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a 'blood bag' for the sick War Boy Nux. Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa drives her armoured war rig to collect gasoline. When Furiosa drives off-route, Joe realizes that his five wives — women selected for breeding — are missing. Enraged, Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.Verdict: Mel Gibson fans will find their hero sorely missing in this one. The only consolation is that Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the main antagonist 'Toecutter' in the original Mad Max, is cast as a new villain Immortan Joe.Fans of Tom Hardy will be disappointed, as Charlize Theron ousts him in every cut of the film. She is the major character of the film and Hardy plays the role of the side-kick. The sound and special effects are very well done, which is the only redeeming aspect of this latest film.More George Miller Films: Twilight Zone: The Movie(1983), The Witches of Eastwick(1987), Lorenzo's Oil(1992), 40,000 Years Of Dreaming(1997), Babe: Pig in the City (1998), Happy Feet(2006), Happy Feet Two(2011).Thank you for having the time to read my review.

Alien: Covenant," A disappointing movie which I saved to watch on my birthday.
","I was utterly let down. Director Ridley Scott achieved cult status for his 1979 film Alien. Subsequent sequels were directed by James Cameron(Aliens 1986), David Fincher(Alien 3 1992) and Jean-Pierre Jeunet(Alien Resurrection 1997). Alien Resurrection was meant as a homage to all the fans of Alien who were offended by Ripley's death scene in Alien 3.This film is the third Alien film directed by Ridley Scott and follows events after his film Prometheus(2012).In 2104, 11 years after the Prometheus expedition, the colonization-ship Covenant is bound for a remote planet, Origae-6, with two thousand colonists and 1,140 human embryos aboard. The ship is monitored by Walter, a newer android model that physically resembles David. A stellar neutrino burst damages the ship, killing 40 colonists. Walter orders the ship's computer to wake the crew, which includes several married couples, from stasis. The ship's captain, Jake Branson, is burned alive when his stasis pod malfunctions. While repairing the ship, the crew picks up a radio transmission from a nearby, habitable planet. Against the objections of Daniels (Branson's widow), the new captain, Oram, decides to investigate. Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict. The casting of the film yet again is atrocious. None of the actors, except Michael Fassbender who plays the role of the android David shine. Katherine Waterston is not in the same league as Sigourney Weaver who became a household name as Ellen Ripley. If you think about it, Prometheus turns out to be a better film than Covenant and with a slightly better cast. Special effects try to be innovative and unique but still I was not impressed. The aliens portrayed in the film are mostly biped and more human-like.I also disliked the script which seemed dull to me and also left a lot of holes. The android in the film David was thoroughly incapacitated and destroyed in Prometheus. Only his head part remained functional. Here he appears fully restored and by whom? David plays the same role as Ash(Ian Holm) in Alien(1979). The sound effects are decent the overture score in Prometheus is yet again played in this film. Cinematography and editing is not overly impressive.Now comes the main question: has this film an element of horror. Yes. And also very disturbing. Perhaps this is the most horrific chapter of Alien ever directed. But overall, in rewatchability - it fails. Why on earth would I want to watch a run-of-the-mill toilet-paper Hollywood movie again. Just flush(to outer-space preferably).",3,3,5,14 September 2017
The Martian," It's Too Bad, But I've Already Seen Classic Sci-Fi Survial Films Like Robinson Crusoe On Mars(1964) and Enemy Mine(1985).
","But as a time-pass film it's definitely worth a watch. This is Matt Damon's second science-fiction horror film film following Elysium(2013).This film is directed by the highly acclaimed director who is best known for the cult science-fiction horror film film Alien(1979) The film is about a stranded astronaut Mark Watney who is left behind on Mars. The first part of film is about how he manages to stay alive while a rescue mission is planned. Mark Watney is a botanist by profession, and as his food source is dwindling he decides to grow some potatoes in Mars's soil.The second part of the film deals with the planning essential to his rescue. NASA director Theodore 'Teddy' Sanders(veteran actor Jeff Daniels) debates whether the lives of Mark's fellow astronauts is worth risking to save one life.Public concern increases as Marks plight is televised back on Earth. Mission commander Melissa Lewis(Jessica Chastain) deliberately disobeys her orders and plots a course to rescue Mark.Will Mark be rescued or will further disaster ensue? Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: Cast is decent. The photography is by the acclaimed Dariusz Wolski(The Crow 1994, Crimson Tide 1995, A Perfect Murder 1998, Hide and Seek 2005, Prometheus 2012). Harry Gregson-Williams has directed the music for the film. He has worked in films like The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, X-Men Origins: Wolverine and the Shrek franchise.Supporting actors Sean Bean, Michael Peña, Chiwetel Ejiofor(Amistad 1997, 12 Years a Slave 2013), Benedict Wong and Donald Glover give professional performances.There is one more thing I must mention, earlier I saw The Europa Report(2013) which I consider to be the best modern science fiction film ever made. I sincerely recommend you to see this film in theater, online or through DVD/BLU RAY rental.More films to see: Journey to the Far Side of the Sun a.k.a. Doppelgänger (1969), Mission To Mars(2000), Red Planet(2000), Gravity (2013), The First Men in the Moon (1964) and lastly the superb film based on the true events of Apollo 13 made into a 1995 film directed by the acclaimed Ron Howard.Thank you for reading my review, live long and prosper.",7,3,5,1 January 2016
Law Abiding Citizen," Whereas David Fincher's Seven 1995 received accolades, this masterpiece went unnoticed.
","This film counts as among the best movies I have ever seen. It is a solid revenge based thriller, with tense drama and terrific performances by Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx. Indeed these two actors will be remembered for this film when they are no longer in this world.The plot of the movie is about a man Clyde Shelton(Gerard Butler) whose wife and daughter are murdered right before his eyes as he remains incapacitated by his attackers. Afterwards he seeks help from the law - particularly his attorney Nick Rice(played by Jamie Foxx). To his great distraught he finds that one of his attackers Clarence Darby(Christian Stolte) has cooperated by giving a full confession of the crime and putting all the blame on his partner Rupert Ames(Josh Stewart) who was innocent. Rupert promptly gets the death penalty by lethal injection and whereas Clarence is given a reduced sentence of manslaughter in the third degree and sentenced to only five years of imprisonment.Outraged by all of this, Cylde seeks justice against the entire judicial system in his own brand of justice...Verdict: this movie is a stylish A-grade thriller in the same vein as Fincher's Seven(1995). Acting, directing, photography is top-notch. The excellent screenplay is by Kurt Wimmer who has written great screenplays for movies like One Man's Justice 1995, Sphere 1998, The Thomas Crown Affair 1999 and Equilibrium 2002. F. Gary Gray is a superb director who has directed another good thrillerT he Negotiator (1998). Brian Theodore Tyler who has done all the music of The Fast And The Furious Franchise, handles the background music and effects exceptionally well. I highly recommend this movie for your collection.",10,1,1,10 June 2019
