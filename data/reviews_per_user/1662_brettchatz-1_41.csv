Changeling," Brilliant Slice Of Yesteryear
","This marvelous rendezvous into the past is directed by acclaimed movie mogul Clint Eastwood. Starring the inimitable and devastatingly gorgeous Angelina Jolie as Mrs. Christine Collins.The story tracks the disappearance of young Walther Collins and the subsequent calamity caused by the LAPD during the period in question. When the little boy goes missing and is apparently recovered 5 months later, Mrs. Collins vehemently protests that it was indeed not her son who was returned to her.In a cloak and dagger world of crooked cops Changeling goes to great pains to portray the angst and determination of a mother longing for her son's return.Jolie's performance is adequate but certainly not Oscar worthy. Clint Eastwood has delivered another fine production.",7,4,7,30 November 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Sasha Baron Cohen reprises his role as crazy Kazahk Reporter in the USA
","Finally, one of the most talked about films of the year has arrived! 'Borat' is everything you never dreamed of and then some. Critics have praised the shameless audacity of comic genius Sasha Baron Cohen, who stars as one of his three alter-egos Â– the Kazakh news reporter Borat. There is no film more blatantly crass, vulgar or chauvinistic than Baron Cohen's 82 minute escapade.The film tracks the journey of a fictional TV reporter from Kazakhstan, to the US and A. Sasha Baron Cohen, aka Ali-G and Bruno, plays the bungling, anti-Semitic, vulgar character of Borat as he traverses the United States in search of Pamela Anderson. The film exemplifies one inescapable reality of life, that it is a journey and not a destination. Indeed the film Borat is more a testament to the uncanny ability of Baron Cohen to extract the innermost feelings from his guests without them having a clue that he is having them on. The Americans expose their contemptuous feelings towards Jews and Muslims and gays, in a film formula which highly effective.Borat is an uncompromisingly uncouth character, devoid of Western airs and graces. The Freudian references to the male genitalia, a measure of his masculinity are constantly displayed in the film. Phallic symbolism is displayed in abundance in Borat and the hysterical irony of his endeavors with many gays, prostitutes and Jews drives home the point of a prevailing prejudice in all inanity. This is film which will have you in stitches throughout its duration. At times you will be wondering how on earth Borat has the gall to defecate in the Trump gardens, or how he nakedly wrestles his compatriot for what is an uncomfortably long time.Either way, this film which cost $18 million to make will realize unbelievable returns. Borat could only be done with someone of the ilk of the inimitable Sasha Baron Cohen.Be warned, there is explicit nudity, innuendo and strong language.",8,1,6,17 December 2006

United 93," Harrowing from beginning to end
","United 93 is a frightening retelling of the tragic events of September 11 2001. The film is essentially a real time recount of the horrors of the blackest day in American commercial airliner history. It is the true story of a commercial airliner hijacked by terrorists with the goal of slamming into the White House.With the Twin Towers already destroyed by two other hijacked flights and the Pentagon already in flames, United 93 was the final assault vehicle to complete an unprecedented attack on America. Not since Pearl Harbour had America been attacked on its home soil, but come September 11 2001, all of that was about to change.United 93 is as riveting as it is macabre to watch. Here is a retelling of the inefficiencies of bureaucracy; the inefficacy of intelligence and the lack of co-ordination between various civil and military agencies. It is the factual recount of citizen bravery; hijacking horror and absolute pandemonium.The recreation of the events of that fateful day was dramatized by the filmmakers, but countless hours were spent on effectively developing characters akin to those who lost their lives on that flight.This film was not produced for entertainment purposes; it is essentially an historical non-fiction documentary, dedicated to the memory all of those people who lost their lives 6 years ago. This film is an education: it simply has to be seen.",10,0,1,1 September 2007

Inglourious Basterds," If Only History Could Be Rewritten
","Quentin Tarantino is a genius. With his latest bloody score, he promotes a concept that has been entertained the world over for more than 65 years. The elimination of the Nazi top-guard in 1944.The film stars a capable cast including Brad Pitt. The premise is simple, a group of Jewish American soldiers led by a backwater platoon leader.Their task is simple: 100 Nazi scalps per Jewish soldier. It's a tall order given the sheer mayhem that was the third Reich in greater Europe.But these lads go about their job with vigor. They're more ruthless than the Nazi brutes they are slaying. Of course there is loads of treachery, violence and fantastic Tarantino mayhem.Fans of the historical cum Tarantino twist genre (newly created) will go berserk for this blockbuster.",8,0,9,8 October 2009
Iron Man 2," Super Action-Comedy from Robert Downey Jr.
","The inimitable Iron Man returns in an exciting sequel and fans are going to roar with excitement There's a whole lot more to Iron Man 2 than meets the eye. Purists of the Iron Man Marvel Comics genre will no doubt find many elements of the film to their liking. Such was the mastery of combining humour, action and digital effects that the film was an unqualified success.Tony Stark returns to the fold in his typical narcissistic style. In fact if egos the size of his were commonplace, the world would need several iron men. Robert Downey Jr reprises the role that he so perfectly portrayed since the first installment of the multimillion dollar series. He's witty, intelligent and noticeably a few years older! But weapons expert Tony Stark is also Iron Man and this alter-ego has a life-force all his own.The presence of Iron Man in the early parts of the stellar film is rather limited, but he soon rocks back into action and brings a roar of approval from the audience. There are scenes where the anticipation of Iron Man's arrival are like literal live-wires and it's great to see him restoring order.Mickey Rourke expertly portrays Ivan - a physicist with a bent for Stark's destruction. He's heavily muscled, wicked beyond compare and his plan to destroy Iron Man is not without its merits. But can he team up with Hammer Industries to create an army of cyborgs to destroy the Iron Man? The film has many side plots such as the budding romance between Stark and his beautiful CEO - Pepper (Paltrow). Moviegoers will love Don Cheadle's side-kick role as an apt Iron Man tag-team star. And a cameo by several heavyweight Hollywood A-listers will do more than tickle a few taste buds.The film has been accused of being unoriginal and while there are obvious overlaps with the first installment, the action is all-new and the humour is incisive. It's witty from beginning to end and it gives new meaning to the words 'tin grin.' The verdict: Do not miss the awesome action-packed superhero flick - Iron Man 2.",9,8,14,7 May 2010
Superbad," A story of lust and toilet humor!
","Film preview: SuperBad Starring: The cast is a talented ensemble of A-Grade comedy actors in Johah Hill; Seth Rogen; Michael Cera; Bill Hader and Chris Mintz-Plasse Director: Greg Mottola A fantastic new film will be hitting South African cinemas soon and it's called SUPERBAD. What you will see will rock your comedic foundation like never before. This film is the ultimate in crass, toilet-humour; hormone-driven, supercharged American comedy at its best. That's right guys, this piping-hot crude release from Sony pictures has exactly what it takes to thrill you, chill you and leave you in absolute hysterics. As the title of the film suggests - you gotta come get some! SUPERBAD is an awesome flick, which has its origins with the producers of The 40-year-old virgin. Better yet, the screenwriters who brought you the inimitable Da Ali-G show - Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, have come together to produce this sparkling little gem of a film. You simply know it's going to be awesome - with a behind-the-scenes pedigree like that. It's America's most successful form of modern-day comedy and it will tear it up when it hits SA screens. With a modest budget of $20 million (USD) and takings in excess of $50 million (USD) in its first week of release in the US, this film has already scooped up significant profits. Essentially, this is the story of two socially inept teens about to graduate from high school. Evan and Seth are about to live life apart from one another as they move into college. Evan is the quintessential spineless gentleman - smart, sweet and terrified of women. Seth on the other hand is obsessed with sex and is what we'd call blatantly vulgar.",9,1,6,1 September 2007

Carl refuses but accepts a challenge to join a positive thinking seminar. Run by the Guru (Terence Stamp), Carl takes him up on the offer and decides to say Yes to all things in life for 1 year.He meets a cute gal, starts to live life and gets involved in hilarious situations. It's formulaic, predictable and light-hearted. This films works from a philosophical standpoint as things only happen if they are allowed to happen.Carrey is back, but there is very little new content here.

The Expendables," Bank on Stallone
","The Expendables is an exciting 80s throwback action film. It features a stellar cast of some of the hottest names in showbiz (from that era) and provides a dollop of on-screen chemistry between the main players.Perhaps the best part of the movie is the opening scene where Somali pirates and the Expendables face off against one another. For all its shortcomings though - critics have found many - this film is a fitting tribute to the genius of rags to riches star, Sylvester Stallone.The Expendables delivers on its promise of big action, big stars and big explosions - period. Even the violence in the flick resonates with an air of comedy - such is the nature of the movie. Stallone truly deserves a $100 million blockbuster as a tribute to his four decades of hard work as one of Hollywood's A-list actors.",8,4,11,29 August 2010
The Town," Hard hitting heist caper
","Critics have slammed Ben Affleck in recent times, but their criticism is sorely misplaced when it comes to Affleck's latest blockbuster - The Town. Fresh off the success of his last venture, he has starred in and directed a masterpiece.The Town is the story of Charlestown. A low-income neighborhood in Boston. The people coming out of this blue-collar town have rap-sheets stretching way back. But these gangsters and bank robbers are as savvy as they are violent.Affleck's crew have one last heist to pull off before they throw the towel in. With the FBI hot on their tail and a budding romance in the works, this hard-hitting, gritty caper pulls no punches in delivering a KO performance.From an entertainment perspective, it's absolutely riveting viewing. Two-thumbs up for Affleck and his star power.",9,1,3,23 October 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," Two thumbs up for a sterling performance!
","FILM REVIEW: THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA Cast: Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway; Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci Academy Award winning performance from veteran actress  Meryl Streep.The Devil wears Prada has set the benchmark for riveting entertainment. This five-star effort is devoid of the irksome hindrances of CGI effects and demolitions forays. In essence, here is a film with nothing but superb acting performances from its fantastic cast. The story is credible; the characters are multi-dimensional and the script is masterful.Meryl Streep plays a cruel, unemotional corporate executive, who is both feared and reviled by those she works with. As CEO of a leading fashion magazine, Miranda Priestly's character is anything but her namesake equivalent. Her no-nonsense approach to fashion industry dealings and her treatment of employees bears testament to the cut-throat world of corporate America. Her outwardly calm demeanor and soft-spoken manner belie her ruthless comportment, in direct contrast to the insouciant character of Andy Sachs, her assistant, played by Hathaway.The story tracks the exploits of a carefree gal named Andy who wants to follow her journalistic ambitions. She applies for a position at the fashion magazine and much to her surprise Miranda Priestly is instantly charmed by her. Their business relationship rapidly develops and Andy soon excels at her craft. Naturally the job is exceptionally demanding and the hours are insane. The story tracks the metamorphosis of the typical girl next door into a remarkably gorgeous woman.The trade-off is high but the dream is real. This story is a window into the real world; a world of deception, manipulation and at times inanity. The characters learn to conform to the norm and in so doing foregoing their individualism. Stanley Tucci delivers a fine performance as Nigel  Miranda's right hand man.",9,0,0,22 October 2006
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Just think, there's another one coming
","Potter fans will do their nut, the rest of us will wonder what all the hype was about...Just the other day I went to the United Artists theater to see a weekend screening of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. I found it intriguing that so many millions have been made in ticket sales for what is essentially a mediocre film.Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter is the mainstay of this latest rendition of a story that has been stretched taut a long time ago. That they have been able to breathe new life into a 7th version of this claptrap is quite astounding.Harry Potter #7 offers nothing new and its 2 hours + running time could be better spent enjoying Russel Crowe's Next Three Days or even Skyline. If it's value for money you're after then this is a little shy of the mark.It's much ado about nothing really. Harry and co are searching for a magical sword and some funky amulets that need to be destroyed. That's it. The special effects are hardly noteworthy and this reviewer is already bored at having to do a write-up on this title.",4,3,6,28 November 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Poor but for the music
","Film Review: Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story Starring: John C. Reilly and Jenna Fischer Spoof, nostalgia and great music The story of Rock Legend Dewey Cox begins with a rather amusing line by the on-stage organizer: 'I'm looking for Cox; anybody seen Cox?' That pretty much sums up the film, with the exception of its only saving grace  the music.While the film itself is little more than a cheap shot at every other musical biography, it provides viewers with many nostalgic moments of the industry's greatest artists. Dewey Cox - a fictional icon  is a hard rocker with a penchant for trying out different women; drugs and various styles of music.His peculiar relationship with Hassidic Jews brings freakish absurdity to the film, but the comedic element of The Dewey Cox story is seriously lacking. The producers of SuperBad and Knocked Up could have done a whole lot better that this slice of mediocrity.Best left alone.",2,4,10,3 January 2008
She's the Man," Modern day Tootsie!
","Film Review: She's the Man Cast: Amanda Bynes, Channing Tatum, Laura Ramsey and Vinnie JonesWe're not all who we say we are This is the story of a girl who masquerades as a boy to play in a soccer team.Viola Hastings, played by Amanda Bynes, is not your average collegiate girl. When she decides to replace her brother Sebastian Hastings, in his elite boarding school she has to take the caper all the way.The real Sebastian Hastings is busy fine-tuning his artistic skills in London for a few weeks. Viola, keen to impress on the soccer field, decides it would be a fantastic idea to impersonate Sebastian.From sharing the boys' dorms and showers, to some sticky gender relations, this film does a fine job of examining the peculiarities of the sexes.It's certainly tough predicament when you're dressed as a boy, in love with a boy who happens to be your roommate, and all the girls are besotted by you.In the spirit of films like Big Momma and Tootsie, in reverse, She's the Man is a fun teenage comedy replete with clichéd gags and a handful of new ones.The film builds up to an exciting crunch-match between Sebastian's college Illyria and Cornwall. Naturally there are a few last-minute revelations.This film certainly doesn't take itself seriously, nor does the audience. It is what it is and it scores just fine in the ratings department.",6,0,0,18 January 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man," Superb Storytelling and Spellbinding Entertainment
","The Amazing Spider-Man doubles as a captivating dramatic ensemble, and a thrilling action-adventure story. Purists of the Spider-Man genre will be delighted with this work of art.The inimitable tale of Spider-Man gets retold with poignancy; it's a masterful recount of the agony and wonder which brings this legendary Marvel superhero to life. The anguish that our hero labors through is palpable and his journey to manhood is fraught with difficulty.Spider-Man is every bit the model of youthful exuberance and boyish fascination. Spidey oozes appeal in this pulse-pounding escapade through New York City. The script focuses almost exclusively on the pain that young Peter Parker endures and the growth and development of his character is sublime.The journey of Spider-Man is explored in detail, at a pace that truly appeals to mature theater-goers. The action steadily gets turned up, until it's a full-throttle, action-adventure delivered at a blistering pace.",8,2,6,8 July 2012

As he lays there on his deathbed, he has one final trick up his sleeve. His dutiful apprentice Amanda, played by Shawnee Smith, has already proved herself to the master tactician. She acts as his hands, eyes and ears in procuring his new test subjects.The sadistic Amanda leaves her victims little chance of survival, setting impossible situations for them from which to escape. With only one certain outcome, each of her distraught subjects writhes in agony.In his final hour upon the stage Jigsaw enlists the help of a nurse to perform a lifesaving operation on him. Their lives are dependent on one another and upon the success of a third person within the elaborate maze of death.Naturally there is a plot within the mangled plot and it is there that Jigsaw has the last laugh.This is a harrowing, macabre and sinister tale of unimaginable proportions. The moral depravity of the characters is beyond belief, especially when one considers that at the film's conclusion the audience tends to side with Jigsaw's vile conduct.With a modest budget of $10 million, this film has raked in hundreds of millions worldwide  another huge success for twisted pictures.",7,0,1,21 January 2007
Tropic Thunder," Great Fun
","Tropic Thunder sports a stellar cast in this summer's blockbuster spoof movie. Ben Stiller stars as a mega-action hero in what is supposed to be a jungle warfare film.When the production studio threatens to pull the plug on a big budget action story, the director takes his film to a new level. The actors are suddenly thrust into a real-life story - fighting groups of merciless bandits and narcotics traffickers in Asia.Led by a young boy, the rebels take the actors hostage - demanding $100 million for their release. But the actors soon step up to the challenge. A series of terrific pyrotechnics displays erupts, followed by a glamorous Hollywood ending.For all its flaws, Tropic Thunder is a non-stop action adventure. Robert Downey Jr. is particularly convincing in his role as an African American fighter. Ben Stiller toned up and toughened up as he took on a Ramboesque role as the platoon's head honcho.A great film; lots of fun",7,2,5,22 August 2008
District 9," Containing The Aliens
","District 9 is an interesting film in that it is set in South Africa - a country with a tragic history of separation and intolerance.That this was the case is hardly ironic, the filmmakers deliberately used South Africa's racially divisive history to emphasize the ill-treatment begot by 'Prawn' aliens landing in Johannesburg some 20 years ago.Peter Jackson lends his masterful cinematic experience to a film which has proved that South African filmmakers can confidently stand alongside Hollywood giants in the big-action sci-fi flicks.The story is a nostalgic mix of Starship Troopers, Independence Day and perhaps even Alien vs Predator. The visual effects are stunning, the action is intentionally documentary-style and overall it comes across pretty well.Over 1 million 'Prawns' are being forcefully relocated away from the main population center in Johannesburg - some 200km away (reminiscent of the Group Areas Act - where the Afrikaners forcefully vacated Black shantytowns away from White Areas). But not all the 'Prawns' are going down without a fight.That's where Wickus Van Der Merwe - MNU Operations Head comes into play. This soft-spoken bureaucrat is charged with the removals. But he gets 'infected' by 'Prawn' DNA and so begins a terrifying journey of self-reflection, disillusionment, rejection and prejudice.Suddenly Wickus knows how it feels to be hated. He is ostracized from his family, his friends and society. His new goal is to help get the 'Prawns' back onto the mother ship.

The Mist," Not for the squeamish
","A small, quiet town in Maine, New England, is turned upside down when a portal to another dimension is opened by a group of military scientists in The Arrowhead Project. The real tragedy is what the government accidentally brings through this ominous portal  terror and horror like never before.What was once a peace-loving environment becomes a feeding frenzy for flesh-eating abominations from hell. David Drayton (Jane) is just a regular dad going about his business when an electric storm sends a giant tree crashing through his living room. This storm is particularly vicious and soon even his neighbor (Braugher)  a boorish man  suffers the same fate. Over on the horizon they notice something inexplicable gathering momentum  a heavy mist.The group heads out into town to replenish their supplies but that's as far as they go. With this ubiquitous mist comes nothing but gruesome death. A large group of townies finds refuge in a local supermarket. Here their fears are amplified; paranoia takes root (in true Stephen King style) and hell on earth begins its frightful journey. The Mist silently stalks all living creatures while it conceals carnivorous bugs and beasts of unimaginable proportions.If you are squeamish or easily spooked, The Mist is definitely not for you",6,1,5,28 November 2007

Somehow Nicholas Cage and his teeny-bopper daughter appear on the scene - armed with Batman-style wizardry and superhero abilities.The film devolves into a bungling morass of absolute junk.

The Dark Knight," Box-Office spinner!
","Batman lives on and if box-office takings are anything to go by then this feature film is set to put a significant dent in Titanic's image of record revenues.Let's face it, in just 3 weeks the Dark Knight has managed to bring in over $614 million dollars. That's a whopping achievement by anyone's admission. That the caped crusader was able to do this in such a short period of time, given the worldwide recession, is nothing short of unbelievable.The latest addition to the Batman saga is fierce; sordid and violent. It sports Michael Caine and Christian Bale along erstwhile legend Heath Ledger. Whether it was Ledger's phenomenal charm or the fact that controversy surrounds his suicide is beside the point. Batman has nailed it yet again with an astonishing tally of receipts. The problem however lies in it's foreign box-office totals.While Titanic scored a solid $600 million domestically, it raked in over $1.2 billion internationally. That's where the Dark Knight has to make serious inroads. If this flick is going to rally anywhere close to James Cameron's Titanic, then the international arena is where it simply has to score big points. One wonders whether the adventures of yet another Batman saga will interest hordes of movie goers trying desperately to remain afloat in a world of surging inflation and economic hardship.For now, the only thing that isn't sinking is the grandiosity of Titanic's massive takings.",8,0,9,16 August 2008
Blood Diamond," Hard-hitting viewing!
","Film Review: Blood DiamondLeonardo DiCaprio; Djimon Hounsou; Jennifer Connelly and Arnold Vosloo Greed and gratuitous violence coupled with some stellar performances Perhaps the film's message cuts too close to the bone; perhaps it's the miserable plight of the indigent Africans that scared viewers away or maybe it's Leonardo DiCaprio's Southern African accent.Either way, Blood Diamond tanked at the Box Office, but this film is nothing less than a masterpiece.Blood Diamond tracks the ruthless world of warlords, mayhem and power vacuums in Africa's rural heartland. It is as much the story of one man's fight to save his family, Solomon Vandy (Djimon), as it is another man's fight to absolve himself, Danny Archer (Leo), from a hateful life.This film is up there with some of the most riveting films in recent times. Leonardo DiCaprio has again turned in a brilliant performance as a former Rhodesian, turned South African wreckie from 32 Battalion, in search of Blood Diamonds.Theatre goers will be hopelessly unnerved by the wanton destruction and savagery depicted in this epic saga. The heart wrenching scenes take some getting used to, but behind the chaos lies a carefully scripted storyline.Child soldiers are a real part of Africa's rebel movements and the producers of this $100 million work of art have captured the essence of Africa's battle with greed and corruption.Central to the storyline is the virtual monopoly on sales of Diamonds. De Beers is substituted by the Van De Kaap consortium, but it's all the same ruthless capitalist element. The Caucasian elitist fatcats seek nothing more than profits  at any cost. With totalitarian control over the diamond market and artificially high prices, it is an industry desperate to maintain higher demand than supply.This is truly a knockout film and one you certainly wouldn't want to miss!",8,0,0,20 January 2007

","Film Review: The Departed Cast: Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon; Alec Baldwin and Martin SheenDirector: Martin ScorseseScreen legend and celebrated actor, Jack Nicholson lands a knockout performance as Boston's most feared crime boss in The Departed.It's a tale of murder, drug-trafficking, duplicity and ruthless violence.DiCaprio sheds his pretty-boy image and does justice to his acting pedigree by delivering a powerful performance as an undercover cop working for a mob outfit.Matt Damon plays the snitch inside the Police Department, feeding vital information to Nicholson's character.It's as much a story of betrayal as it is a high-octane thriller. Neither cop knows the other is working for the enemy.It's this deadly web of deceit that ultimately forces Nicholson towards increasingly violent behaviour.If nail biting suspense and gritty action is what you seek, The Departed is the summer blockbuster film to see!",8,2,4,29 December 2006
The Holiday," Can long distance romances really work?

American Gangster," Ridley Scott delivers yet again
","The American Mafia was largely controlled by a string of brutal Sicilian families. Rival mob organizations targeted one another in bloody confrontations. Harlem was no exception. New York's largest black ghetto  a happy hunting ground for drug pushers  was to face its toughest challenge yet.When a much-loved icon and drug dealer passes away, the reins of his empire are picked up by his impressionable protégé  Frank Lucas (Washington). But Frank has bigger designs for himself. A self-styled entrepreneur, suave and sophisticated, Frank wants to cut out the middlemen and be his own man.During America's most-stained period in history  the Vietnam War  Frank seizes the opportunity to acquire huge quantities of A-grade heroin. On the other side is the vulnerable hero Richie Roberts (Russel Crowe) who is determined to bring him down.The story twists and turns for almost three hours towards its conclusion. Denzel is in fine form alongside a more sedate Russel Crowe. The film scores mad points in riveting entertainment value.The lesson of the film is simple: 'Quitting while you're ahead is not the same as quitting.' www.brettchatz.blogspot.com",7,1,7,1 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Mediocre attempt at intellectual comedy
","Cast: Will Ferrell; Dustin Hoffman; Maggie Gyllenhaal; Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah Writer and character come together like never before Acclaimed fiction writer Kay Eiffel is busy constructing her latest literary installment. It's not intended to be a Pulitzer winning effort, but it is an interesting exploration into mediocrity and the shackles of conformity.When Eiffel suffers the debilitating effects of writer's block, she enlists the help of an assistant, Queen Latifah to give impetus to a story stuck in the doldrums. Of great concern to Eiffel is how to end the lead character's life and thus conclude the story.The real twist in the story is the juxtaposition of fiction and reality. When Harold Crick (Ferrell), a mundane IRS agent and the protagonist of Eiffel's story, begins hearing voices, he becomes alarmed.After a series of hilarious meetings with a literature professor portrayed by Dustin Hoffman, Harold believes that he is the victim of an author's creation. Together they slowly begin to unravel Crick's story, voices and all.A sudden love interest begins to stir Harold Crick and it is this caterpillar cum butterfly princess that ultimately steals the show. Harold realizes that his imminent fictional and physical death can only be undone by meeting with the author Kay Eiffel.The stimulating script is masterfully written; the characters are exceptional and the essence of it is poignant.Stranger than fiction is best described as an intellectually stimulating insight into the complexity of love, life, humor and mediocrity.",5,2,5,6 February 2007
Inception," Mediocrity at its most benign
","Inception indeed sports a stellar cast and its ratings have been an unqualified success. However, in spite of such commendations, this film is at best mediocre. It reeks of the residue of the Matrix and has elements of other much-loved dream caper films such as the Nightmare on Elm Street series of yesteryear.The special effects are mind-blowing, the acting is par excellence, but the concept itself - rather than being sublime, is in fact nothing spectacular at all. The gist of it is that Di Caprio's character is able to enter the minds and dreams of his subjects. He plants seeds to uncover data and everyone becomes interlocked in the same dream, with surprising twists and turns.The twist in the film - let's leave that to the audience to uncover - is hardly worth the running time of the film and what it promises in terms of high-impact mind-blowing content falls short of films like The Sixth Sense and Fight Club. Overall, it's nothing more than a high-tech visual extravaganza of spectacular stunts and a seemingly LSD-induced storyline.",5,6,10,8 August 2010
Music and Lyrics," The script is witty; the acting is superb and the music is soulful.
","Film Review: Music and Lyrics Cast: Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant Romantic comedy strictly for the ladies The 1980s were fantastic for pop sensation Hugh Grant.

His only claim to fame now is a handful of crooning middle-aged woman.Enter present day New York City. A super-hot rising starlet named Cora is seeking a song for a gala evening. Grant and his withered lyrical abilities are contracted to compose her dream song - in only three days. It's a tall order and he is all out of ideas.Enter Drew Barrymore  his plant care giver - a refreshing breeze of inspiration into his mundane life. Together they learn to laugh all together, compose together and see life through the eyes of two people madly in love.Music and Lyrics is truly a chick-flick in every sense of the word. There are no effects here, other than effective acting.",7,0,0,1 September 2007

Click," Sandler spins his charm yet again
","CAST: ADAM SANDLER; KATE BECKINSALE AND CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.Adam Sandler is renowned for his irrepressible comedic genius. He possesses a rare talent consisting of an ensemble of slapstick buffoonery and egocentric satire. His formulaic comedies have spawned a generation of die-hard Sandler fans expecting nothing less than the pervasive wit and guile of Adam Sandler in full swing.In Click, Sandler plays Michael Newman a workaholic trying desperately trying to make partner in a successful firm. His demanding boss is adequately portrayed by David Hasselhoff. Sandler tries frantically to please his superior, but his efforts largely go unnoticed. The result is continual work dissatisfaction and mounting pressure on his home life.Sandler's wife is played by the exquisite Kate Beckinsale. To label her gorgeous would be doing her a grave injustice for she is the quintessential picture of beauty. She is the doting wife of an overworked architect and the attentive mother of two delightful children. The strain of her relationship with her husband is driving a wedge between them Â– that is until Sandler is gifted a universal remote.This is no ordinary remote though: it controls the passage of time and allows for a thorough revision of the past and a rapid transition into the future. What it doesn't allow for are changes to deeds already committed. The angel of death, who hands Sandler the remote, cautions him that the device is non-returnable.Naturally Sandler's curiosity is piqued and he begins toying with the quirky device. A series of humorous incidents ensue, but the comedy is hardly worth laughing at. The audiences remained largely quiet throughout the duration of the film, with the exception of the usual sexual innuendo and toilet humour which cracked a few smiles.The film goes off the rails for a while but just when it starts losing the audience; it utilizes drama to great effect to reel the crowds back in. Sandler is surprisingly effective in his dramatic performance. It is a detraction from the norm but one which will leave you teary eyed and heartbroken, until the final ten minutes of the film. Christopher Walken is a spectacle to behold in this dramatic comedy.This is a must-see Sandler film, not because the laughs come thick and fast, but because it is able to work on raw emotions so effectively. The concept of family and priorities are essential to the film and you are bound to be wiping the tears from your face in the last quarter.Two-thumbs up!",7,8,14,17 December 2006
The Cabin in the Woods," Enter the Realm of 'The Cabin in the Woods
","The Cabin in the Woods is not your average horror flick. Whatever preconceived notions you have of this film will quickly be turned upside down during the film's running time. Fans of the horror genre will do their nut with this selection, owing to the ubiquity of blood and guts, genuine scares and a bizarre supernatural finale.The script appears formulaic, what with scantily-clad college gals, the jocks, the token black guy and the stoner. That's where this film turns convention on its head: it is not what it appears to be. The brains trust behind this film includes the likes of Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard (Fans of the horror genre may recall 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer.')The stars of the show are Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth and Anna Hutchison.The film kicks into high gear with expectations of the group of 5 college friends enjoying a weekend getaway in a remote locale. What happens there is beyond expectation. Horror fans will be perplexed throughout the film's duration and thoughts of 'The Truman Show' and 'The Ring' are likely to be conjured up. Banish them, because The Cabin in the Woods is nothing like what you're expecting. Prepare for sheer horror, because you're going to get it...",7,1,6,29 April 2012

Smith plays a brow-beaten salesman, desperately trying to sell bone-density machines to doctors and hospitals. With an uncertain income and mounting bills, the financial pressures soon become unbearable.Forced to move from his apartment with his son, in search of accommodation, the peripatetic Smith seeks any place to call home. The story tracks the heartache and misery of an exceptionally determined father. With no certainty about where he is headed and a disinterested wife, he must find a way to rise above his poverty. As luck would have it, he applies as an intern at a financial brokerage firm. With no tertiary education and only a dream to guide him, he musters the courage of his convictions to stick it out for six months of unpaid employment.This heart wrenching tale hits home with startling realism. This is a true hero's tale, if ever there was one. The moments of emotional agony; fear and yearning are as palpable as they are in real life. One cannot but help commiserate with the characters. This is an exceptional film in every respect of the word. Smith is simply a phenomenal actor, skilled in the art of comedy, action and drama.",9,0,0,1 September 2007
