Hereditary," Tragically Dumb
","This is a very dark and depressing film. Not scary at all...just extremely dark and the family is very depressing. Kind of like spending two hours watching paint dry on the wall. It really gets ridiculously stupid. I really wouldn't waste your time on this one and can't remotely understand anyone that would give this a good review. Now, if you like dark and depressing films, you may love it.",1,2,5,6 September 2018
Gravity," Absolutely Horrible and Ridiculous Movie
",I cannot even comprehend how people are writing positive reviews of this film! I was with an entire group of people and we all laughed on how ridiculous it was. I love how she propelled herself to the Chinese Satellite with a fire extinguisher LOL. So unbelievable. Initially I was excited about this film and listened to the people involved in the film in how it took 5 years to develop the technology to do this film. I honestly didn't see anything special. How can someone praise Sandra Bullocks acting in this film...there was none. She looked ridiculous coming out of the spacesuit with bare feet as they tried to show her sexy body glide through the satellite .... Would someone like her bother with face and eye makeup on a mission? I think not...and yet her makeup stayed flawless throughout the whole movie LOL. Sigourney Weaver in Aliens makes Bullock look like an amateur.This movie has been done before....and it was called OPEN WATER....and it was a lot better...more believable and far superior acting. This movie doesn't deserve the Hype it is getting.,1,17,35,20 October 2013
The Hunger Games," I read the book and this was a fantastic film!
","Unlike some of the reviewers that read the book and were unhappy with the film adaptation, I felt the movie did the book great justice. You can't expect the film to be exactly like the book and if they included everything in the book it would end up being a 5 hour film. Having read the book, I can tell you that some of the things that were omitted from the book were mainly due to having to keep the film at an acceptable length. The film even got the thumbs up from the author herself, which I think says a lot right there. I thought all the actors did a fantastic job....especially the wonderful Jennifer Lawrence. She is a rising star and for good reason. For a film that is over 2 hours, you will find that it flows easily and keeps your attention. I know many people that have already seen it 2 or 3 times. I strongly recommend this film!",10,5,15,2 April 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Disappointed
","I can only preface that I am a huge Star Wars fan, but this film fell very flat. I felt there was very little dialogue and many periods in the film that were rather slow and boring, My friend and I nearly fell asleep!Without the nostalgia involved, we asked ourselves if we would like this film if we had never had anything to base it on and it was a resounding no. I am giving it a 5 for average just because I love Star Wars but that is the only reason I am afraid.Also, we felt there was no character development at all, which was very sad.",5,52,104,19 December 2015
Furious 7," Why would anyone want to willingly watch this garbage?
","Never have I seen a single movie of this series and was encouraged by many that this was a great 'action' flick. We don't even need to discuss the unrealistic action scenes, but the acting was atrocious. How do these people become movie stars? I have seen better acting in video games. The writing was beyond hideous. Atrocious, atrocious movie. Anyone with half a brain cell wouldn't like this film. I can honestly say that I have never seen a film that makes you feel that your IQ goes down every minute you watch this film. This is the type of garbage that is produced that makes me feel embarrassed that it was created in the United States. The dialog in this film is probably at the third grade level and someone of normal Intelligence could have written the story in about 2 hours.",1,6,310,1 May 2015
