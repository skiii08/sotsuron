Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An okay film...not great, though...
","I went to see The Phantom Menace on the second day it was released, with my whole family. I was on holiday before hand, and although I enjoyed it, my mind was really on going home, and seeing The Phantom Menace. The cinema was pretty packed, and I think we managed to avoid all the trailers, so we were just sitting down when the Fox fanfare started. I was sitting next to my sister, who's a big Star Wars fan too, and we were almost pinching each other when the words: Episode I The Phantom Menace appeared on the screen. I quickly got into my film analysing mood, and just sat back at watched it. Although the opening battle with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon was all terribly exciting, I found myself thinking, 'Come on, get to the plot!'. When Jar Jar arrived on the screen, instead of sighing deeply like the rest of the audience, I actually found him quite funny (he does make me laugh occasionally even now), especially the scenes inside the Bongo. And although I was enjoying it, and on the edge of my seat during most of it, I found myself thinking that when Obi-Wan is hanging onto the edge of the pit during the lightsaber duel, I didn't care particularly if he got his lightsaber or not. I know that sounds like a dreadful thing to say, but if it wasn't for the fact that I liked Obi-Wan in the Classic Trilogy, and liked Ewan McGregor, I wouldn't have cared about the character at all. And I didn't mind Anakin. I thought he's youthfullness fit in exactly with how Luke Skywalker acts in the Classic Trilogy, so he had all the Skywalker traits, although I would have liked it if some of his darker side was shown during the film. Infact, I got a bit fed up with the whole, 'He gives without any thought of reward,' thingy...it seemed a bit...well, unrealistic...which is a dodgy word to say when you're dealing with Star Wars. Also, I felt a distinct lack of empathy towards Amidaala. She seemed a bit arrogant, frankly. I think her impassive tones got on my nerves after awhile, partly because it sounded like a very rubbish attempt to do a posh English accent. When Padme appeared, I did connect with her more, but she still carried that slightly arrogant streak from before. Qui-Gon's slight sense of detachment was good, too, but after watching it later, it seemed as if Liam Neeson was bored. I thought the whole Darth Sidious/Palpatine was terribly clever, and his honesty towards Amidaala was almost believable...almost. Infact my Dad, who doesn't know much about Star Wars, did manage to work out that Palpatine was up to something, but he didn't realise that Palpatine was Darth Sidious. My Mum, who isn't a big fan of science fiction (she's more into the Psycho/The Mosquito Coast/Chicken Run style of film), but I think she got quickly absorbed into the plot. In fact, she even shed a little tear when Anakin left his mother. My sister didn't like Jar Jar at all, but she found the Nemodians' accent terribly funny, for some reason (well, I did, too).One thing which I felt was missing from The Phantom Menace, was the dry wit of the Classic Trilogy. I actually bought the screenplay before hand, and I skimmed through it, and notice that Obi-Wan had a really cool line in the opening sequence, which was something like, 'Off hand, I'd say this mission is part the negoations stage,' which is a pretty cool thing to say in the middle of a fight, but sadly....it wasn't there. Why George didn't keep that line in, I have no idea. Another thing which really didn't gel with me was the Gungan/Battle droid fight sequence. Now, I'm all for slapstick (I love Tom and Jerry, and Harpo Marx, and they're pretty much built on slapstick humour), but the whole thing of Jar Jar acting like an idiot, while everyone around him was getting killed I really didn't like. Maybe it's because as I grow up with Doctor Who, I have a strong anti-war feeling, and the whole idea of playing a battle sequence for laughs is just disgusting. Sure, it's great to have a silly bit in a battle sequence, like in Return of the Jedi, but when it's all silly, it get's a bit sickening. Also, I felt the whole space battle sequence was over far too quickly. In the Classic Trilogy, the battle sequence play an important part in all three films. Sure, I wasn't expecting something on the level of excitment as the Battle of Yavin, or the Battle of Endor, but something along the lines of the Asterdroid field chase in Empire Strikes Back would have been great. Instead, it's only given a few moments of screen-time, and is over all pretty quickly. The opening bit on Naboo was so boring, too. The camera moves so slowly from Panaka to Amidaala, then to Bibble, it looks as if someone who knew nothing about film directed the thing. The lightsaber battle was something that I really enjoyed, but the lack of a conversation between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, and Darth Maul was something that I didn't like, either. Now, when I say conversation, I don't mean discussing the weather, I mean sinister stuff. In fact, I was pretty disapointed that Darth Maul only spoke about two times. Not really fair, is it? I also felt the Tatooine stuff went on for far too long. We've seen Tatooine before, and now it's not an alien environment. It's not interesting. It just seems like being in your mate's back gardern. Not really exciting, if you see what I mean.What I did like was the senate stuff. The funny thing about The Phantom Menace is that there are some bits which are totally uninteresting, flat scenes, and other bits where you can tell that George has woken up, or is getting used to directing again. The senate scene is just like this. So are all the bits with the Jedi, and Darth Sidious. Also, many people said that what The Phantom Menace needed was a cool, Han Solo character. Well, we've got him, and it's Qui-Gon. If Han had become a Jedi, he'd probably end up being like Han Solo. Also, although I'm a basher, I actually liked the whole midichlorian thing. I thought a scientific explanation for the Force was quite cool, and fitting into the idea that the Republic was more advanced than the Empire.One problem was that after seeing the film, my family did the usual thing of discussing the plot, and we happened to be standing next to the poster for Episode I, with Anakin casting the shadow of Darth Vader.  My Dad, who's a very Anyway, this is probably the longest thing I've ever posted on here, so just to finish, when me, my Dad, my Mum, sister and brother came out of the cinema, we did the usual thing of discussing the film, and we happened to be standing by the teaser poster of Anakin with Darth Vader's shadow, and my Dad said, who's a very intelligent bloke, 'Oh, so that little boy becomes Darth Vader, does he?' Now, at the time I felt that was the most embarrassing thing my father has ever done in public, but when I think about it, really The Phantom Menace was just for fans, and didn't make all that many allowances to the casual film goer",6,0,1,25 February 2001
A Clockwork Orange," One of Kubrick's best
","From the cold, haunting, electronic opening theme of A Clockwork Orange (written and directed by Stanely Kubrick), you can tell immediately that this will be a very unsettling film.  Alex's (played by Malcolm McDowell) leering stare into the camera, as it slowly zooms away, is very menacing, and you can tell instantly that this isn't a fellow to be messed with! Through the narration, he tells you of his gang or his droogs as he calls them, and his fondness for something called 'ultra-violence'.   We then come to the first scene, where he and his gang savagely beat up a defenceless old drunkard.  Then they get into a fight with another gang, which is played to classical musical, but strangely enough, it seems to fit in perfectly with the violence on screen,  which I think is part of Stanely Kubrick's skill as a director.  After that, they steal a car, and go joy riding down a country lane, with little regard at all to any other people on the road.  They then come to a quiet house, owned by a writer and his wife, which they have chosen for what Alex calls, 'Surprise visit'.  What this surprise visit consists of is forcing their way into the house, trashing up there home, and in between beating up the writer, raping his wife in front of him, Alex cheerfully sings, 'Singin'' in the Rain'.  It's such a horrible, disconcerting, violent scene that it's really very difficult to watch, and all this happens in the first few opening scenes!  But it isn't as bleak as this the whole way through.  There are some nice, comical touches to it, such as Alex's slimy parole officer, who at the end of every sentences says, `Yes?', and tries on several occasions to touch Alex up.  Also, when Alex eventually goes to prison for killing a lady, the warden (played by Michael Bates) seems as if he's stepped straight out of the set of 'Porridge', as he's very similar Mr. MacKay, albeit he swears a whole lot more!  There's also the prison priest, who's a rather amusing character, too.  However, the most complicated character in the whole film is Alex.  Although he has committed some awful crimes, for some reason, and I think this is partly down to Malcolm MacDowell's acting, and Stanely Kubrick's direction, you not only feel sorry for him, but you identify and sympathise with him.  Alex is, essentially, still a child, as he lives with his parents, and goes to school.  Also, when he's told that one of his victims is now dead, he's speechless, almost as if it's never occurred to him that somebody could die from his actions.   He keeps a pet too, a snake called Basil, which although is an usual animal to have, it does show that he has a sensitive side. Also, there is a far darker side to his personality, too.  When he reads the Bible, he fantasies about torturing Jesus, and leading many of the battles that happened in the Old Testemant, but has an angelic look on his face while reading it, making the priest think he's had some sort of religious enlightenment!   The main thing that you wonder when watching this film is what kind of society created Alex, and during his time in prison, that question is answered.  The government is clearly a near  state totalitarian state, and consider Alex to be a petty criminal, more concerned about political prisoners.   When Alex undergoes the Ludovico treatment, where he's forced to watch violent images of murders, rapes, and even footage from concentration camps, all to the music of Bethoven, in order to make him a 'better person'.  However, as the priest says, he has no choice on whether to be good or not, and that's essentially what makes us human.  Without the choice, we cease to be human beings, which is one of the many deep themes of the film.  Also, we get the impression that Alex has been through all this before, as his prohibition officer hints that he's been in trouble before, and at the end of the film, it appears that he's back to his old self again. In short, I think A Clockwork Orange is possibly one of Stanely Kubrick's greatest films, and is also one of the best films ever made.  It's a dark, twisted masterpiece of cinema.  It's a bit heavy going, but it's well worth watching!",10,1,2,24 January 2002
