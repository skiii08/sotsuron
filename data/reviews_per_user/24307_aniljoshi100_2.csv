The Devil's Advocate," Horror and thriller at it's best
","I had watched this film when it was released in theatres all those years ago as a youngster. I watched it again today on Prime with the same edge of the seat feeling.Lumax and his wife being a cozy couple move to Manhattan from South (Florida). There is love between them but there is something more than this in Lumax's mind that is beyond the boundaries of relationship. The questions and moralities of sin, love and lust are blurred in his head. He is the winner, the unbeatable and the irrepressible..... well that is what Lumax thinks! How this unravels throughout the film in an enthralling fashion keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats (or the sofa).Keanu Reeves as Lumax is top notch. He has been underrated throughout his career but does the role to it's perfection. Charlize Theron as his wife has done brilliantly well. Considering she was so young at that time both in terms of age and career, the role is quite complex and she nails it. Al Pacino is class. The subtle change in his mannerisms quickly within scenes is a treat to watch.Production is excellent with just enough amount of CGI used to justification. The rest of the screenplay moves with the tight storyline so one doesn't need CGI all the time. Pace is constantly on the edge and one is totally hooked to each frame till the end.A thrilling ride to be enjoyed!!!",10,2,2,7 June 2020
Midway," Surprisingly wonderful film
",The story of Battle of Midway during the World War II in 1942 has been very effectively conveyed on the big screen this time by Roland Emmerich. He is back again lifting up a few notches higher from his recent films nearly back to his best.The graphics have been used very well and apt to the storyline. Film's screenplay is tight holding the audience throughout the length of the film. Its a very good war film without pushing all the nationalistic feelings that some others have done in the past giving a fairly balanced view from both American and Japanese perspective.Ed Skrein and Patrick Wilson have portrayed very well and so has Nick Jonas.Well worth watching this one.,9,4,7,16 November 2019
