Casablanca," Heres looking at you. ..kid?
","The diegetic and non-diegetic music in the film created so many different atmospheres. Humphrey Bogart 'Rick' always has a cast of shadow on one side of his face, but 'Ilsa' Ingrid Bergman face is always so well lit and beautiful. I know it's a big famous line, but really It creeped me out that Bogart's character kept saying 'Here's looking at you kid' to Ilsa. She looked like a women to me. Doesn't seem right for an older man to be romantic with a kid? It was impressive how so much was going on between so many different characters and it all blended together smoothly. Wonderful film that i would like to watch again, to understand more of the politics involved.",8,1,3,15 March 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," Just a little piece of a big soul
","This film really captures the trials and tribulations of the immigrants during The Great Depression. With the inclusion of the great devastation of the Dust Bowl period, which was happening at the same time. One forcing families off of their land and the other creating economic despair. A no win situation. The long take of the Joed family entering the Transient camp from the actually family's point of view was really intense. You feel as though your right there with them. The best line in the film is in the last ten minutes of the film when Tom Joed says to his mother ' A Fella ain't got a soul of his own, just a little piece of a big soul. The one big soul that belongs to everybody' This was the most beautiful part of the film besides the memorizing landscapes.",10,0,1,15 March 2013
Annie Hall," Very funny
",There are so many lines in this movie that i would totally quote. Woody Allen has such great witty humor and Diane Keaton was the perfect counter part for him. I really enjoyed Diane Keaton's chaplinesque clothing style. It work very well with her character. I like that there isn't really a strong message behind this film. It's a film that could be a relationship time line in many peoples lives. Which makes it very easy to relate to. I really liked the scenes were Woody Allen entered his memories of his past and interacted with his young self and others. In these scenes and throughout the film Allen breaks the forth wall and begins talking to the viewer as if they were part of the film.,9,0,0,8 May 2013
The Graduate," great film
","It was fun to see this film right after watching 'Midnight Cowboy' and to realize what an amazing actor Dustin Hoffman is!! He's so good at playing so many different roles/characters. Over all I enjoyed the sound track but after a while the repetition of songs got a little too repetitious. I Didn't really get the ending? Were they at first excited to run off together, but then they slowly realized how much they were loosing? Or that they knew it was a bad idea? They didn't look happy that's for sure. This was a very scandalous movie for 1967, the Hays code was just ending. The content in this film wasn't considered acceptable since 1934, so I'm sure a lot of people were shocked when they saw this movie.",8,0,0,8 May 2013
Singin' in the Rain," Shocked
","Okay, i though for sure i was going to totally hate this musical film, because i usually do not like musicals. I Loved It. The singing, the dancing, the acting and the colors i loved it all. I was extremely impressed with the dancing especially the choreographic work that must have gone into this musical. This is the first time I've seen Gene Kelly in a film. I thought he was wonderful and Handddsome. I was really curious how the tap dancing sounds were recorded? They are so right on point and clear. Don (Gene Kelly) and Don (Donald O'Connor were a hilarious duo. I feel much more open now to giving musicals a chance, but now i'll be searching to one to top this.",9,0,2,21 April 2013
Pulp Fiction," Ketchup
","I really love how Quentin Tarentio reuses his cast through out his movies. Every main character from his previous hit 'Reservoir Dogs' made some kind of appearance in' Pulp Fiction'. Not only do the actors tie his individual movies together, but if you look back from his current movies to some of his first films, you can usually find a little microcosm from that film that he used as a base to create a new film.The movie had a good rhythm even with the scenes being out of order. It defiantly keeps you thinking about the film and how the story really played out. This film is pretty violent, but not as much as Tarentio's newer films. Tarentio has his own style and is totally an auteur director of the modern film profession. I would highly recommend seeing his films, but be ready for some Extreme violence.",10,1,3,10 May 2013
Psycho," Great Film
","This is a top notch film by Alfred Hitchcock. As most of his films, there great twists to the story and your never quite sure how it's going to end. Anthony Perkins played a great role as Norman Bates and i read that he actually was able to contribute his own personal ideas to his character. The music really made this movie as well. I watch a clip of the shower scene without the music and it didn't feel even half as climatic. The cinematography through out the film was very well done. The famous shower scene of course but there are also some great over head shots and panning shots as well. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and would be surprised to hear of anyone disliking it.",10,0,0,1 May 2013
