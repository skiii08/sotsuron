The Blair Witch Project," Scary for most
","I've got two things to say about this movie.1.) It probably is one of the most terrifying films in the past ten years. I haven't been this shaken since I saw 'Jacob's Ladder' for the first time. You will not see a film with more originality or outright intensity this year.2.)  Do not go see this movie if you are one of the following people:-You consider 'Con Air' and 'Armageddon' to be the two greatest films of all time-You are overly critical about films, and feel the need to nitpick details that really don't matter in the long run.Remember, an open mind and a vivid imagination will make this an experience you will never forget.",10,1,2,8 August 1999
Minority Report," Worth the price of admission, but . . . (SPOILERS!)
","As for most Speilberg films, I went into Minority Report with all of the expectations in the world.  On pretty much every level it delivered what the buzz had promised, but I still had expected better.  This movie had the opportunity to throw in some great plot twists but they somehow seemed cliched.  Granted, the writing was superb, the acting and effects top-notch yet I felt I had seen this type of whodunit film a thousand times before. The ending with VonSydow getting shot with his own gun really could have used some more imagination.  Overall a movie worth seeing, but not to be considered anything more than what it is.  A great jaunt in escapism.",Null,0,0,10 July 2002
The Orphanage," More Than Expected
","Picking this up from the video store (while sick as a dog I might add) I knew it was a Guillermo del Toro production which gives it a little more shelf-cred than most choices. All I can say is the first 80 minutes scared the holy hell out of me (even though I sorta saw a couple things coming) and the last 20 almost made me cry out loud. Atmospheric? Check. Skillfully directed? Check. Fantastic performances from the lead actors? Check. Unbelievably morbid? You have no idea - but that morbidity only enhances how truly moving the end of the film is. If we had even ONE movie per month hit theaters with this much class, the world would be much easier to live through on tough days.",8,2,5,18 October 2008
American History X," Why can't they all be like this?
","I just saw this movie for the first time last night and I haven't felt this way since the ending of 'The Deer Hunter.'  It's amazing to see a single film take a character and develop him in such a way that it seems like two opposite and distinct personalities.  Ed Norton gave the performance of his life in this movie, and it's too bad that the Academy Award for best actor can't go to two people in a single year.  The thing that impresses me the most is the way that they didn't stereotype the characters like they did in 'Higher Learning' or make them completely wooden like in 'Juice' or 'Menace.'  Norton's shining and most convincing moment didn't even come with dialogue in this film.  The flashback scene where Derek just stares at Danny while he gets arrested, with that God-awful grin on his face will probably haunt me for days.  I guarantee this movie will be shown in high schools and anger management classes for years to come.",9,0,0,26 April 1999
Black Hawk Down," Simply amazing (Spoilers)
","I just got home from seeing this film and I need to make one point before I put in my two cents:  I have read a few reviews on this site that claim some of the dialogue is cheesy or contrived, especially the scenes with Cpl Jamie Smith.  If any of these reviewers had actually read the book before seeing the film, they would know Jamie was a REAL person who ACTUALLY DIED on 10-4-93.  He was not a character conjured up by some writer.  I can't say for sure, but I think Cpl Smith requesting that Sgt Eversman tell his parents that he fought bravely was probably close to the truth.  Cpl Smith's father was a Ranger in Vietnam, and the book explains that Jamie had wanted nothing more than to join TFR his whole life.  I'm sure he would have wanted his father to know he died fighting.  As for the rest of the movie, it left me emotionally drained.  I thought just about every part was as close to the book as possible and Ridley Scott did a phenomenal job of portraying the horror and confusion of war.  Considering the number of Rangers and D-Boys that were a part of this battle, Scott had no choice but to give a blow by blow account of what happened.  If he had wanted to do a character study of these men, the movie would have lasted for days.  The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the movie shows the 10th mountain division arriving at about 11:45 pm.  In reality the tanks and APC's did not arrive until morning.  I thought that took away from what the Rangers and D-Boys had to go through, being pinned down all night.  As a whole, the movie was technically and visually amazing.  It seems Mr. Bruckhiemer can produce a decent movie after all.",Null,0,0,19 January 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Great, and yet . . .
","Well, it's finally here.  The movie I've been salivating about for the past 4 months and I got to see it last night at a 10pm pre-screening. Unfortunately, it just didn't do what the first one did.  I'm not saying Reloaded is a bad movie by any means, it just doesn't create the sense of awe that the '99 film did. There are a few reasons for this:1.) Excessive use of CGI characters during fight sequences 2.) The proliferation of reality bending fight sequences in other films since 1999 3.) Keanu Reeves' acting (You know I'm right) 4.) The storyline is well known, and they just don't do enough to further new plot directions during the majority of the film.However . . .The visuals in this film are so damn good it makes your head pop.  I have NEVER seen anything like this before and I'm a little frightened about what the W Brothers came up with for 'Revolutions.'  Also, without giving too much away, the last 45 minutes will throw you for such a loop that you won't be able to get out of your head.  Grab a friend, buy some tickets and don't have such high expectations.  You'll love it.",8,0,0,15 May 2003
Con Air," Watch this only if you have nothing better to spend $2.50 on.
","After seeing 'Top Gun,' 'Days of Thunder,' 'Crimson Tide,' 'The Rock' and 'Bad Boys,' it seemed the Simpson/Bruckhiemer team could do no wrong.  Not exactly true.  I saw this movie once in the theater and I will never see it again.  Why did one shoddily put together effort have to waste the acting talents of Ving Rahmes, John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi and Nick Cage?  Why does hollywood feel the need to pump out this inane drivel summer after summer.  Why do we keep going to see it?  Luckily, Bruckheimer redeemed himself with the quasi-intelligent and surprisingly entertaining 'Enemy of the State.'  Overall, If this movie is to be rented, make sure the better Simpson/Bruckheimer movies are all checked out first.",Null,0,0,28 April 1999
The Sixth Sense," Oscar Nomination? (Spoilers)
","**************SPOILERS AHEAD************** ******************************************
It literally took me five minutes after the shrink got shot to figure out that he was already dead.  It was so obvious when no one talked to him OR saw him except for the kid after the first scene in the movie.  Now, granted, I heard that the ending had a twist to it and that did kind of wreck it, but COME ON PEOPLE!!  Number 22 of ALL TIME???!!!!  Even worse is the fact that some people thought this ending was better than 'The Usual Suspects' which is heresy in its greatest form.  Osmett (sp?) was good as the little disturbed kid, and Willis also showed some real talent but being nominated for best picture made me ill.  Three kings was superior in direction and story and I'm pretty sure didn't even receive a nomination for anything.  There, I've said my peace.",Null,0,0,7 June 2000
