Walk the Line," I loved it!
","Being a Cash fan almost from birth (my parents, especially my dad, were fans), I was pretty skeptical going in. The depiction of Johnny's childhood, and the difficulties June had living in the shadow of a famous family...and their absolute growing devotion to each other was truly moving. I thought, no one could capture John and June. I was so wrong! Both Joaquin and Reese's performances were right on the mark, and the music was fantastic. Any Cash or country music fan should see this film. Even my teen-aged nephews want to see it, which makes me very proud! I would definitely see it again, and that's saying a lot, because I usually wait for movies to come out on DVD.",10,1,3,24 November 2005
