Sucker Punch," this certainly gets folks hot under the collar
","Lots of reviews, people feel something about this movie to bother writing in. Outrage or adoration but not look-warm.Well, I've never played a video game as I'm too old so I don't recognise anything in this movie from video games.It wasn't what I expected from the trailers. I thought it would be girl power kicking ass, which is pleasant at the time. At one point it reminded me of Charlies Angels,'oh, the girls go off on a mission, & indeed kick ass'. I did feel frustrated however when I thought, we've had 2 missions & have another 3 to go - this is getting a bit tedious. But then I just looked at the beautiful strange sepia landscapes & enjoyed that.I could almost explode with frustration at one point, I just wish the girls had kneed the guys where it hurts and done them irreparable damage, preferably killed them. The abuse of power was so outrageous & vicious & all the lying crap,'I'm doing this for you, we're in this together,,,blah blah' This reminds me of lots of corrupt people in power, I guess that's why it's so frustrating -- we've all had this to some extent, unless of course we are the one doling it out. I was pondering during the film if it was about corrupt age and power against youth, or men against women - I hear that there are thousands of women and children being trafficked as sex slaves at the moment. But then it felt like our corrupt institutions (Britain) which grind us down & constantly eat away at our rights as fat bankers and politicians smile and tell us it's for our own good they have to raise taxes and put people out of work.So I think that this film actually took something very unpalatable & just plain nasty (the way we allow ourselves to be bullied by the government), that no one really wants to look at apart from a few outspoken groups - and they dressed it up with beautiful actresses, fab music and amazing visuals, so that we could swallow this bitter pill. Who the hell wants to watch some whinging documentary about corruption in high places: we all know it exists, we just feel powerless to do anything about it.",10,4,10,3 April 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," really enjoyed this
","I wish this film had been longer to include more of the sense of time passing, as in the book the pregnancy takes a long time - there is also the relationship with Seth & Leah. There weren't any wolf fights in the book, but I guess films feel the need to do visual stuff. A friend disliked the leg shaving scene, but I liked that was left in as Bella was feeling nervous & it was in the book. I liked the time on the island, that gave a sense of how long the honeymoon was. The whole film was under 2 hours, so it's a shame they didn't add a bit more time and settle down more into the being in the house part. I love these books, and it's not for the action - I would be quite happy to not have any action, just see how the people relate to each other. When the wolves turned back to people again they really should have been naked (that would have been quite nice, & more authentic) - but they managed to have loads of clothes on. Oh well, you don't get everything. It would have been nice to see more of the Jacob/Rose hate thing, which was quite funny too. I'm looking forward to part 2 with the beautiful Renesmee - interesting when she's very little. I would really like to see more of the relationships in the house. The book was perfect, so it's a shame to change things about for the film, but I guess they just don't have time to cram so much information in. I'm going to see it again, as I'm sure there are loads of details I missed. I was a bit worried about Kirsten; is she actually that slender? Or was that emaciated look done by computer to show the ravages of the pregnancy?",Null,3,9,21 November 2011
The Intouchables," yummy French film
","Full of energy. What really hit me was Driss's energy. He is a young, street wise, survivor. Bursting with testosterone, such a boy. He comes from poverty and walks into luxury: but he's not overwhelmed by it, no tugging the forelock and being intimidated for Driss. He never wavers from being himself. He is unpredictable as he explores the rich world he has walked in to. He might break something, or steal something, or assault someone. If he thinks something is rubbish he says so. He laughs when he feels like it, which can be considered inappropriate - but Phillipe usually agrees with him - he has this way of freeing Phillippe to see things another way.Driss is as big, powerful, energetic man - who is quite happy out in the street sharing a smoke with a bunch of other almost homeless guys like himself. He's like a panther, he could quite easily knife someone if he had to, to survive. He is raw energy. Then here he is placed in a rarified, alien place, learning to put support tights on a bloke!!What I'm trying to get across is this tornado of energy being gentle & compassionate, but never being tamed. He's not a tame panther, not particularly safe, but with Phillippe he is nurturing. He's authentic. No politically correct, spin crap here, if he's irritated he'll tell you to f--k off. Very refreshing - a real person.Philippe is great too, that he sees the potential in Driss and isn't scared off by the idea of Driss, his background and all.It's so refreshing to see a man portrayed as a man and to be so powerful, sexy and loving on his own terms: when he can walk comfortably in completely different worlds without apologising to anyone.",9,1,2,8 October 2012
The Artist," hmm, curious
","I just saw this in Jan 2012 as I really didn't want to miss is as it has been portrayed as something 'amazing', as in extraordinary. I was waiting to be blown away, and wasn't.Lead George appears charming & deeply content with his life, but his wife hates him & sits at home miserably with a face like a bag of smashed tatties. If he is such a happy and satisfied guy, why haven't they sorted that out, they're like a couple in their 70s waiting to die.The dog is gorgeous, most grounded character in the movie. There's a very loyal chauffeur, who works free of charge for a year. Studio boss is very quick to let George the silent movie star go, he just disappears overnight after being mega-famous. Is Peppy very fond of George and remembers how kind he was to her and is determined to return the favour, or does she fancy him, as her behaviour could be seen as that of a stalker. Then at the end they dance, the tap was OK, but was that a waltz, OK, a 200 mile an hour spin round the room. It just left me flat and bemused, no light bulb moments.",5,0,5,29 January 2012
The Da Vinci Code," what a thoroughly excellent movie
","I've only just been to see this because the book irritated me so I'd blacklisted it. But my son wanted to go, so off I went.We were both gripped, I kept sneaking looks at my son (12) to see if he'd fallen asleep; there were plenty yawns (we went to a 8.10 showing) but he watched it all and enjoyed it. He especially liked the history bits when they were putting the pieces together. I was impressed.I was very pleasantly surprised. The acting was great. It was lovely watching a movie where intelligent men are discussing women reverently. I remember reading about the bleak days of the witch-hunts when many women were slaughtered, and the world lost immeasurable knowledge because it was the witches (healers, users of herbs) who were killed and other wise, and therefore threatening women who were butchered. It felt affirming to have that noted.The Robert Langdon character was very attractive; intelligent, self effacing, strong and gentle. A man who in a crisis says,'I need to get to a library'. Excellent.I enjoyed this enough to get it on DVD when it comes out. do go and see it.",9,0,3,25 June 2006
