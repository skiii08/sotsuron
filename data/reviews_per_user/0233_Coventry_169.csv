Insidious: Chapter 2," Thank you for the err  clarifications.
","There exist three types of 'sequels' in the horror movie industry Sequels in name only, which have absolutely nothing to do with the events of the original. Normal or regular sequels, which refer or build onward on the events of the original but can be enjoyed separately still. And then finally there are sequels, although a minority, which you simply cannot begin to watch without having seen the original because the story lines of both are interwoven. 'Insidious 2' is such a sequel. Don't you just love it when they are making a sequel in order to clarify and explain the convoluted and twisted plot of the original, only to end up with two utterly complex and confusing movies instead of one! Preferably you should even watch 'chapter I' and 'chapter II' back-to-back to fully comprehend everything. I watched them with an interlude of a few years and really had to dig deep in my memories to remember the details of the first film. But hey, let's first state clear that 'Insidious 2' is an admirable fright-and-jump movie from the talented duo Leigh Wannell and James Wan who already proved that they are masters of horror and easily capable to make the hairs in the back of your neck rise. The Lambert family is still being haunted by ghosts regardless of where they live, and they come to the surface via the spiritual mediums Josh and his oldest son Dalton. Elise, the medium that that helped them to save the life of Dalton in the first film died in the last seance, but it seems as if she's still trying to warn the Lamberts for dangers from the other side, and thus Josh's mother Lorraine seeks the help of her old friend Carl. Meanwhile the police are investigating Elise's death and, since they obviously don't believe in ghosts, they want to frame Josh for murder. The main trumps of 'Insidious 2' are strong performances (Rose Byrne, Patrick Wilson, Lin Shaye and Barbara Hershey always give their finest performances when directed by James Wan), a very patient but extremely atmospheric and ominous building of suspense, genuinely petrifying shock moments that manage to grab you by the throat even though you can see them coming and a handful of intriguing sub plots. The parallel plot of Parker Crane and his petrifying shrew of a mother, for example, is truly fascinating and re-establishes once again that Wan and Whannell are creative writers.",6,0,0,17 May 2016
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino's Triumph: Volume Two
","Rarely 	known a movie I've been looking forward to so much than Q.T's resumption of the Kill Bill saga. I, as well as millions of others film-freaks, awaited Uma Thurman's further adventures with wicked anticipation. And of courseTarantino didn't disappoint. Volume two is a completely different movie than volume one, but it's equally brilliant and the director's trademarks are shown more than obviously. Volume one merely was homage to the Eastern Martial Arts movies, with delightfully over-the-top splatter and gore while Vol. 2 fully focuses on ancient westerns and rural horror. There's more dialogue, more twists n turns and the anti-chronological structure results in more depth and involvement. Some unexplained elements from Vol.1 become clear now and even the entire background of Thurman's character gets unveiled. For the very first time, (as far as I can remember) Tarantino really knows how to create an unbearable tension! There's a sequence in which Uma is buried alive and trapped under the groundThrough simple methods, like a completely black screen, Tarantino arises claustrophobia among the audience! Truly terrific filmmaking. The actors in Kill Bill aren't Hollywood's best, but they each have their charisma and their typical Tarantino characters do the rest. The camera viewpoints are brilliant at times and  as usual  the tiny absurd elements are a joy to discover. Tarantino's entire Kill Bill achievement may easily be considered as one of the most creative and dared film-projects ever! Do yourself a favor and watch them! Over and over again.",9,175,281,22 April 2004
Alien 3," Still Underrated!
","You definitely won't hear me say that 'Alien³' is better or even on par with its two brilliant predecessors. It's not. It's not even playing in the same league, but nevertheless this third entry in one the greatest Sci-Fi franchise ever accomplished is a sublime movie in its own right and the negative reputation it developed over the yeas is undeservedly harsh. Part three isn't as suspenseful as 'Alien' or as spectacular as 'Aliens', but at least the script doesn't aim to be an ordinary imitation of the first two and continuously attempts to add new ideas and twists to the formula. David Fincher's film has multiple trumps, including the depressing setting, grim and nightmarish set pieces, plausible and versatile characters, the recurring presence of the always-reliable Sigourney Weaver and a handful of marvelously staged action sequences and special effects. Somewhere in a distant future  allegedly the 26th century  Ellen Ripley's space capsule crash-lands on prison colony in outer space. The inhabitants of the prison planet are all hard-boiled and dangerous individuals who haven't been around a woman in several years. The unhealthy sexual tension between the prisoners becomes a luxurious issue when it turns out that a rapidly developing monstrous alien sneaked aboard of Ripley's capsule and prowls freely around the facility using the ventilation systems. The unstoppable alien makes several casualties before the remaining survivors gather around Ripley and decide to help her fighting the creature, rather than to wait until the Company comes to the rescue. The first half of 'Alien³' is superior but, ironically enough, also the tamest and more story-driven half of the film. The interactions between Ripley and the prisoners and between the prisoners mutually form the highlights of the film. Every character has a fascinating background and you'll quickly find yourself wondering who amongst them, if any, will survive the confrontation with the alien perpetrator. 'Alien³' masterfully exploits the element of surprise, meaning that  apart from Ripley perhaps  it's practically impossible to predict which character is likely to die next and how. Admittedly the second half, largely revolving on the bloody cat-and-mouse game between the inmates and the alien, is a bit too chaotically filmed and not always easy to follow. James Cameron's masterpiece 'Aliens' offered a delicious smörgåsbord of heavy artillery and copious amounts of gunfire, whereas this sequel is the complete opposite. Supposedly the extraterrestrial prison facility doesn't have any weapons at all (a bit hard to believe, but still) and thus Ripley & C° are forced to battle their nearly invincible opponent with sly and well thought out plans and industrial machinery. The monster's original design still takes my breath away after all these years and innumerable viewings. The alien is  hands down  the absolute scariest movie creature ever developed, and even the newborn ones look incredibly menacing. The climax is stupendous, sad and legendary all at the same time and anyone who ever saw all the Alien films will unmistakably feel the deepest sympathy for Ellen Ripley. Speaking of which, Sigourney Weaver gives her third flawless performance in the franchise she pretty much owns entirely by herself and, just like in parts one and two, she can once again depend on a solid supportive cast. Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance, Brian Glover and Danny Webb all give away the finest performance of their whole careers. Some of the characters are killed off perhaps a bit too early, but it's all part of the delightful surprise and shock effect. The best description of 'Alien³' I ever encountered unfortunately isn't one I thought up myself, but here goes anyway (I wish I could credit whoever said it, but I forgot where I first encountered the comment): 'Alien³' isn't a bad movie at all. In fact, it's a terrific movie and countless times better than 90% of all other outings in the Sci-Fi genre. It just has the misfortune of having to follow two landmarks it couldn't possible equal in the first place. Amen!",8,7,53,8 June 2008
Gremlins," Fluffy fun for the whole family!
","Warning: the first paragraph of this review is admittedly very sentimental and irrelevant. For the more objective part of the review, please just skip to the next paragraph. Nothing gives me greater pleasure in life than rediscovering my old childhood favorites, only now nearly 30 years later and in the company of my own 10-year-old son, who's also developing an enthusiasm for bizarre cinema! I literally get tears in my eyes when I notice my offspring cheering over the same highlight-sequences in the same movies that I used to love so much myself. I felt this joy during 'Escape from Witch Mountain' and 'The Dark Crystal', but never experienced it so intensively as during 'Gremlins'.'Gremlins' is ideally representative of the creative and highly original fantasy cinema of the early 80s. With Steven Spielberg as producer and, even more importantly, the eternal inner child embracing Joe Dante as director, the film is a gleeful mixture of delightful special effects, classic cinematic tributes, an engaging plot, colorful characters and just the right balance between slapstick and action. The narrative starts in Chinatown, a couple of days before Christmas. Eccentric inventor Randall Peltzer seeks a unique gift for his son, and finds an adorable little Mogwai they name Gizmo. The fluffy critter is awesome, but he comes with a few responsibilities. He cannot be exposed to bright light, should never be sprinkled with water and must never ever be fed after midnight. This turns out to be a lot more difficult than it sounds, and pretty soon the picturesque town of Kingston Falls is overrun with Gizmo's malignant and monstrous offspring. 'Gremlins' contains far too many highlights to mention, including every word spoken by Dick Miller and every smallest shot of the unearthly cute Phoebe Cates, and it's even more amazing if you can watch it with the entire family... around Christmas.",9,1,2,20 May 2020
Requiem for a Dream," Drugs are bad, mmmkay?
","Requiem for a Dream must be one of the most unnecessarily overhyped films of the last few decades. By no means it's a bad film butis it really worth all the praising it gets and the commotion it caused? After all, Darren Aranofski's film based on the novel by Herbert Selby is only stating the obvious Drugs are bad and they will, eventually, lead you into a downward spiral of madness and destroy your life. When talking about the screenplay, Requiem for a Dream has nothing new or extraordinary to offer. We follow the unhealthy actions of 4 people. Jarred Leto and Marlon Wayans star as two Coney Island junkies who want to get rich fast and easy by dealing drugs. Leto's character Harry is doing it all for his beautiful girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) so she can open her very own fashion store, selling her proper designs. Ellen Burstyn puts down an amazing performance as Leto's TV-addicted mother who gets hooked on diet pills after she's made believe to appear on her favorite show. I repeat, Requiem for a Dream certainly isn't a bad film. It even is a very well elaborated story with fascinating acting. But the main problem, I think, is that Arranofski too easily thinks that he created a controversial shocker. And that's not the caseIt might look like he directed the perfect 'Anti-Drug-Therapy' movie to him, but he's about 10 years too late for that. Fans of art-house cinema will merely look at it as `been there, seen that'. The visual experiments often annoy and the characters are a bit too shallow to feel any compassion for. The musical score, however, is simply brilliant and probably even the most powerful aspect about the entire film. Although I haven't been able to find it yet, I'm expecting a lot more from `Last Exit to Brooklyn', which was also adapted from a Herbert Selby novel. Requiem for a Dream is recommendedbut please don't rate it 10 out of 10 here on this site. It's already ranked way too high in the IMDb top 250.",5,17,51,2 September 2004
The Ring," Surprisingly good remake of a Japanese thriller
","The Ring is the version of a Japanese thriller from 1998. This Japanese idea was original, chilling and very intense. You know what that means if the USA finds out on something like this...' Let's Americanize it !!!' I'm sorry if that sounded sarcastic but, usually, that IS the general rule behind it. But certainly no complaints this time ! Upcoming genius in Hollywood Gore Verbinski did a great job with it and I even prefer this remake over the original Japanese version. Ringu deserves all the credit it can get for originality and plot but when it comes to entertainment and production, The Ring is far more superior. The story behind the videotape is far more detailed and there's a lot more to discover. You're a lot more involved in this one and the background of 'Samara' is fascinating up to the highest possible level. There already was a good amount of suspense in the Japanese version but Verbinski goes even beyond that level and delivers a rarely seen gem here. Certainly one of the better horrorfilms since The Silence of the Lambs. You almost are afraid to wink your eyes in order not to miss anything that could be an important plot element. It's good to see they still make them like this. Verbinski wisely didn't exaggerate with the horror elements. There are some frightening make-up scenes in it but the suspense keeps you focused well enough. A story like this really doesn't need too much blood or make-up, it all depends on the script and the acting performances. Speaking of which...they're great !! Naomi Watts is, besides a very beautiful woman, a good and promising actress. She got my attention after Mulholland Dr. and she certainly confirms it here. I hope to see her many times again in movies like this. Brian Cox never gives away a bad performance so there's no need to say that he's absolutely perfect in his role here as well. I still can't believe that this guy is so underrated. He should be right up there with other big names of his generation like Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman. He is at least as good as them ! And let's not forget the little girl who played Samara here. Daveigh Chase is really spooky in her role and highly believable. Certainly a girl to keep an eye on in the next few years. The Ring is one of the best films I've seen since the new Millenium and therefore I surely recommend it to as much people as possible. And if you like this film, I advise you to watch a 1980 film called 'The Changeling'...you'll find a few interesting similarities between these two titles. The Ring is the ideal film to watch with a group of people when it's late a night and the weather outside is dark. The perfect atmosphere for the perfect form of suspense. Enjoy !!",6,2,7,16 October 2003
It," No, I don't want your balloon!
","Even more so than with any other Stephen King based horror 'classic' (although that term is highly debatable), a remake of 'It' was bound to happen sooner or later. Clowns always were, and always will remain scary, and horror movies with children as the lead protagonists are incredibly popular for some reason. Moreover, the plot about a sleepy little New England town terrorized by a shape-shifting demon feeding on young children is a quite timeless one. It worked in the late 1980s with a fifties setting, it works in 2017 with a late 1980s setting and it will mostly likely work again in 20-30 year, presumably with a turn-of-the-century setting. To be rather frank and abrupt, I found the original film version massively overrated and had little hope that this reboot would be any better; - even despite all the praising reviews and hypes on Internet forums. 'It' is a very average film, with a very thin plot and exclusively relying on a few strong gimmicks. Come to think of it, the upcoming star-director Andy Muschietti was the ideal man to direct a film like 'It'. Like with his debut 'Mama', Muschietti again masters in camouflaging a mediocre and derivative plot by throwing in a lot of spooky imagery and seemingly controversial plot aspects. Whilst watching 'Mama' and 'It', you quickly get the impression that they are brave and shockingly intense horror productions, but when you start analyzing them, they're not much more than substantially void tales with meticulously pre-measured jump moments. But I must be open and honest about one thing, however, namely that 'It' has a brilliant and genuinely terrifying opening sequence! The footage of little Georgie chasing his paper boat that is floating in the pouring rain, and then subsequently getting confronted with the smooth-talking yet ultra-menacing clown Pennywise from within the sewer hole, is unbelievable tense and uncomfortable. At the exact same moment when blood stains and heavy rainfall are merging on the street, you already know the film will only be going downhill from here! Unfortunately, 2 hours of film and even the credits then still have to come. The story then unfolds in a very formulaic fashion. A group of social outcast and bullied friends, aptly referring to themselves as 'The Losers Club', prepare for a long and boring summer in their hometown Derry. One of them is little Georgie's older brother and he still can't fathom that the boy simply vanished. Together, they discover that there's a remarkably higher number of missing children cases in Derry than anywhere else and that gruesome accidents with child casualties strangely occur every 27 years. Peculiar stuff, like evening curfews and numerous 'missing children' posters on the walls, also appear to be the most common things in Derry. Naturally, all the dreadful clichés and typical Stephen King themes quickly start to follow. Pennywise the Clown is one scary villain, but obviously the real monsters are the adults in town, like the abusive father, the overbearing mother or the violently aggressive cop-father. Outcast kids, including an asthma-patient and an obese boy, transform into brave heroes. When the Losers Club threatens to fall apart, they realize the only way to defeat the demonic Pennywise is to stick together! You know, that sort of moralist nonsense. 'It' is at its best when the source material, King's Novel, imitates that other great novel 'The Body', which was also written by Stephen King and turned into the magnificent film 'Stand By Me' in 1986. Yes, King plagiarizes everybody. Even himself! No, seriously, the child actors are terrific and clearly enjoying themselves the most when they drive around on their BMX bikes and mock each other. Bill Skarsgard is excellent as well, as Pennywise, but the old rule of the horror genre still stands: the less you see of the monster, the more menacing he becomes.",5,3,6,27 July 2018
Casablanca," Here's looking at cinema-perfection, kid
","Out of all the films that are considered classic milestones in cinemahow many fully deserve that status?? Not that many, let me tell youbut Casablanca absolutely does! Casablanca has become history itself, a legendary production that'll live on forever. And it should! This film is essential viewing for everyone who ever showed interest in cinema. Every sequence in Casablanca is brilliant, every character is intriguing and every setting is breath taking. Especially when you're watching it for the first timeyou'll be surprised how much you actually know about it already. Multiple ideas, lines and sequences were so influential and important to cinema, that they have been used numberless times afterwards. You might even say that cinema would have looked completely different if it wasn't for Casablanca. It's a brilliant love-story with irresistible film-noir and comedy aspects. The entire script - line by line - is pure nostalgic and some of the dialogues originally shown here grew out to become pure historical art. This intelligent movie also depends a lot on its superb cast, of course. Bogart portrays a terrific character herea performance that yet has to find its equal. His brute and heartless portrayal of Rick is fascinating, especially because you soon find out that he is in fact just a hurt romanticist, heart-broken by a girl who's about to show up again. This girl (the stunning Ingrid Bergman) is practically the most marvelous lady who ever appeared on the big screen. Thanks to her natural charm and beauty, Bergman makes the most out of Ilsa. Film-noir stars Claude Rains and Peter Lorre supply the film with terrific supporting characters and a right amount of humor and parody. It's amazing how this film combines so many different genres successfully. The cruelty and drama of the war and the rise of the 'Third Empire' is mixed with comedy and romance in a unique way. It cannot be deniedCasablanca is pure perfection and everyone should appreciate it. This film isn't to be missed by anyone, whether you're young, middle-aged or retiredthis film will move you.",10,8,12,16 February 2004
Unbreakable," Mr. Glass, that's his name. That name again, is Mr. Glass
","When I first watched 'Unbreakable', upon its release in theaters in the year 2000, I thought it was a boring and overrated film. Now that I watched it again in 2020, I still think it is a boring and overrated film, but at least now I can easily bring myself to write a handful of positive comments about it as well. Quite a lot of things can change in 20 years' time, that's certain. For starters, M. Night Shyamalan hasn't made anything but rubbish after 'Unbreakable', and continued to do so until the fairly successful 'Split' in 2016, so it's a lot easier to label this one as of his finest accomplishments. More importantly, over the course of two decades, the film grew out to become somewhat of a unique trendsetter and simultaneously a type of underdog in its own sub-genre. Whether or not he intended for it to be one, 'Unbreakable' sort of is a superhero movie. There have been dozens (far too many, in fact) superhero movies in the past twenty years, but in 2000 the concept was still fairly unique, especially considering the protagonist in 'Unbreakable' - David Dunn - is a reluctant and highly atypical kind of superhero.Yours truly keeps on nagging that M. Night Shyamalan stole the basic concept for this film from the relatively obscure horror gems 'The Survivor' and 'Sole Survivor'. True, both films came first with the idea of one single person walking away unharmed from a major disaster that killed hundreds of people, but 'Unbreakable' admittedly is quite original in terms of linking it to superhero powers. After he miraculous survived a train accident that killed all other 300 passengers, Philadelphia security agent David Dunn is stalked and harassed by gallery owner and comic book fanatic Elijah Price. For you see, ever since birth, Price suffers from a physical condition that makes his bones extremely breakable, and he developed a theory that David Dunn must be his counterpart at the other side of the spectrum; - namely someone unbreakable. Why is this interesting? To be entirely honest, I still don't know, and this immediately leads us to what is still the bottom line: 'Unbreakable' is a mainly boring and uninvolving film. The ideas are good and the integer performances (notably from Willis and Wright-Penn) are solid, but the slow pacing is intolerable and the 'big revelation' at the end is quite 'meh'.",6,1,1,14 January 2020
Citizen Kane," The forever fascinating & fantastic search for 'Rosebud'
","Although I'm not entirely convinced if I would personally label it the greatest film in cinematic history (there are just so many to choose from), 'Citizen Kane' remains an indisputable landmark that still seemingly gets better with every repeated viewing – which is quite astounding after so many viewings already – and it will presumably forever qualify as the most influential artistic achievement ever. Orson Welles' brilliant long-feature debut is, prior to and above everything else, a progressive movie that was far ahead of its time in terms of narrative structure, camera work and imagery, source material and pulverizing the sacred American Dream! Welles masterfully depicts self-made tycoon Charles Foster Kane from the birth of his newspaper empire, over the Great Depression and throughout two failed marriages, until his lonely passing in his private sanctuary named Xanadu. Kane is rather blatantly inspired by the real-life newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, and he certainly didn't consider this to be great honor. He even tried boycotting Welles' film, and partially succeeded as his career never fully recovered from Hearst hatred campaign. Understandable, perhaps, since Kane is illustrated as a forceful but megalomaniac and incredibly stubborn tyrant. Everything about 'Citizen Kane' is just overwhelming and demonstrates sheer macho power: the dialogs, the scenery and the bombastic soundtrack. Everything, except  Rosebud.",10,1,4,10 November 2014
Monster," Blonds don't have more fun
","Personally, I'm not a big fan of multi-hyped and large budgeted Hollywood productions, but you can always wake me up for accurate and unsentimental portraits of serial killers! Despite the big names and promotional campaigns that were involved, Patty Jenkins' 'Monster' easily could have been such a truthful portrait. Aileen Wuornos' story is certainly one worth telling, as she was one of the first  and definitely the most famous  female serial killer in recent American history. And yes, the screenplay is fairly accurate in telling her evolution from neglected teenager into male-hating and remorseless murderess, but of course it totally isn't unsentimental and that's why 'Monster' is never at one point as powerful as cult movie classics such as 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer' (about Henry Lee Lucas) or 'Deranged, Confessions of a Necrophile' (about Wisconsin killer Ed Gein). The production values were better, naturally, and the acting performances truly are perplexing, yet this film soon begins to obtrude sentiments of sympathy and compassion and eventually it's Patty Jenkins who decides for us what to think of Aileen. Daytona Beach prostitute Aileen Wuornos is suicidal when she hooks up with young lesbian Selby in a sober gay bar. She convinces the naive girl to run away with her as they can easily live on the money she makes selling her body to customers she refers to as 'Johns'. Aileen is very afraid when she impulsively kills a guy after an attempted rape and it even brings her closer to Selby. The next murders she commits, however, can never be justified and both girls are doomed to run from one lousy motel room to the next. Charlize Theron is terrific, as you've heard, but Christina Ricci's performance is equally impressive and the least she deserved was to be nominated for an Oscar as well. The narration is unnecessary and the film becomes rather dull and repetitive after an hour. The ending was a bit of a letdown as well, as it comes rather abrupt. Overall, 'Monster' is a shockingly mediocre film.",5,1,4,21 April 2006
Inglourious Basterds," The Glorious return of true cinematic excitement!
","Perhaps it's partly because I've always been a hugely over-enthusiast and biased Quentin Tarantino fan-boy (I even thought 'Death Proof' was brilliant), but I can't fathom how anyone could possibly dislike 'Inglorious Bastards'. Tarantino's film is a genuine ode to cinema, and not at all a pretentious and personal hobby-project like some people claim, with a marvelously absurd plot & structure and a deeply fascinating cast of characters. 'Inglorious Bastards' is the type of motion picture that causes spontaneous adrenalin-rushes inside your body and automatically makes your blood pump faster with its brilliant sequences that are alternatively suspenseful, comical and unbelievably violent. From the teaser trailers and previews we've been seeing months from beforehand, it looked as if this would become a simplistic and insignificant (but nevertheless entertaining) WWII-action flick, but the eventual finished product is a massively surprising epic with style and content that very well could be the most genius movie of the year. Right from the opening chapter, ingeniously titled 'Once upon a time in Nazi- occupied France', it's crystal clear that Tarantino's amazing talent for writing dialogs hasn't vanished yet (in spite of what QT-haters claim) and that he even improved his skills regarding the building up of tension and atmosphere. Together with his talented eye for acting talent and exact casting (the relatively unknown Austrian actor Christoph Waltz depicts the ultimate Nazi villain in the history of War movies); the intro grows out to an intense and mesmerizing 15 minutes long verbal cat-and-mouse game ending in sheer terror. The next chapters are definitely more light-headed and marvelously over-the-top with the introduction of the titular bastards, the film-within-film plot about a German private who single-handedly slaughtered half an army and Joseph Goebbels turning his adventures into a propaganda movie, the hilarious preparations for a well-planned assassination attack and the return of an orphaned Jewish girl with her mind set on vengeance. The bastards are unquestionably the main attraction of the movie. They're a battalion composed of Jewish soldiers and one lunatic German deserter. Under the command of the pleasantly deranged Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt in an amusing role), they prowl around the occupied French countryside and sadistically kill & scalp Nazi officers wherever they can. This concept is vintage Tarantino, with borrowed ideas from great War movie classics, psychopathic character drawings (for example the Bear Jew with his baseball bat), hilariously witty dialogs and anecdotes and extreme uncompromising violence. 'Inglorious Bastards' is a non-stop series of brilliant sequences and unforgettable little trivia details. I could easily list fantastic moments throughout five whole pages, like the use of David Bowie's song 'Cat People' and the Strudel scene inside a French restaurant, but the principal message is to just go and watch this film! Only Tarantino could take a serious topic and setting like WWII and turn it into a darkly comical fantasy with absurd twists and a downright demented climax in which practically the entire Third Reich becomes exterminated in one massive shootout. Like always, Tarantino playfully messes around with the fixed values of cinema. Usually WWII movies stick close to the facts and alter the characters' names, but here the names of all Nazi commanders are maintained but the events are completely fictional. Still, and I truly hope that all the negative minded Tarantino critics will finally realize this as well, our director respects and pays attention to little important details like languages and cultural differences. The Germans speak German, the French speak French and the Americans mock the Europeans regarding all the typical clichés. Everything about 'Inglorious Bastards' is brilliant and this will undoubtedly become another Tarantino movie that I plan to watch and re- watch numerous of times.",10,7,18,30 August 2009
Underworld," Burn your money instead of giving it to this !!!
","Ugh...I've seen this movie in the cinema yesterday and I still feel dirty. The first thing that went through my mind when the end credits rolled was: suckfest !! I'll stick to that thought...TOTAL suckfest !
You have to know, I'm a real sucker for werewolves and I've been waiting since so long for a new good movie about them reaches the theaters. Ginger Snaps and Dog Soldiers were decent films but they never made it to the big screen ( at least not here ). So, Underworld contains the first cinema-werewolves since ages but it's pure crap. The best way to describe Underworld is : Blade meets The Matrix with a slice of The Hulk near the end. In other words, this means : too loud, way too much over the top and far from original ( although it pretends to be very original ). I may be a very old-fashioned person when it comes to matters like this but in my humble opinion werewolves and vampires are ancient, mythical creatures with a long history behind them already. Showing these icons as futuristic, multi-armed warriors is despicable and can be described by one single word : BLASPHEMY !!I guess we can point our finger to 'director' Len Wiseman...Not in ONE part of this movie, this guy proves that he surpasses the level of an average videoclip director. The entire finished product looks like a publicity stunt for MTV or something and above that, Wiseman seems to be proud of that. Oh well, I guess he was to busy thinking about going to bed with Kate Beckinsale instead of filming a good movie. Speaking of which, I honestly have to say I never heard of Kate before this film. That's not a surprise actually, since she starred in Pearl Harbor before this and I'm trying to avoid that movie as much as I'm trying to avoid Leprosy ! The rest of the cast is not worth a mention...I only liked Lucian ( the über-Lycan ) up till a certain level.I'm really annoyed by the plot idea of this movie. In case you don't know: Underworld tells the story of a war that is going on between Vampires and Werewolves for centuries already. Although Wiseman claims it to be creative and innovating, it falls into the same old cliché ***SPOILERS*** the origin of the war was a passionate matter ***END SPOILER**** ... I hate people who claim to be original while they're in fact telling the same old story in another form ! And here's another provoking aspect : why are, during the whole movie, werewolves shown as the inferior species ?? Correct me if I'm wrong, but in this movie the vampires are merely shown as lazy and irritating creatures while the 'lycans' are far more motivated and dedicated ! Is it because the star herself is a bloodsucker, perhaps ?
No, all together, it may look promising and fascinating if you're a 13 year old pimpled horror freak with giant braces in your mouth ( no offense if you are, by the way ) but if you're a bit of a traditional horror fan, this movie will leave you behind with an empty feeling.",2,3,17,25 October 2003
This Is the End," It's the End of the World as we know it  and Hollywood doesn't feel fine!
","Should I or should I not review this movie? That's the question I asked myself for nearly a week, because – and I do fully realize that nobody cares, really – I decided long time ago that I would restrict myself to exclusively reviewing horror, cult or exploitation movies and then preferably only the most obscure and peculiar ones. I want to stay clear of mainstream Hollywood productions with famous names in the cast or gigantic budgets. But on the other hand I truly fancy apocalyptic tales and flamboyant gory stuff, so in spite of its A-listed cast, 'This is the End' actually qualifies to receive a review after all. Okay, the whole project is basically a joke and probably only the cast and crew found it truly entertaining, but it does inarguably feature gore, mayhem and a truckload of references/homages to classic as well as lesser known genre titles. The idea is undeniably original and innovative. A group of actors, supposedly not playing but 'being' themselves, are gathered together for a housewarming party when all of a sudden the biblical apocalypse descends upon them; - and the rest of Hollywood and the world I reckon. Most of the party guests are annihilated straight away, like for example Rihanna who gets sucked into a super-massive black hole in the ground or Michael Cera who gets impaled on a lantern pole, but six of them entrench themselves in the ultramodern home of their host. They are James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson and the uninvited Danny McBride. Whilst fire and brimstone reproduce hellish monsters outside, the survivors are practically murdering each other on the inside. 'This is the End' is not much more than a spitfire of absurd situations and inside jokes about the cast members' previous collaborations (particularly 'Pineapple Express' seems popular). If you don't particularly like these guys or the films they made, you will most certainly dislike 'This is the End' and consider it to be a pretentious and nonsensical piece of rubbish. As a film fan, you can't really ignore the influence guys like Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill had on comedy cinema in the last 10-15 years. They appeared in too many movies to list, often together, and the vast majority of them were box office hits ('Superbad', 'Knocked-Up', 'The Interview', 'Bad Neighbors' ). Their humor is often crude, monotonous and orientated at soft-drug use and bedevilment between friends, but their films do feature imaginative premise and many downright ingenious ideas. 'This is the End' also relies on a handful of really strong sequences and comic highlights (for example the exorcism of Jonah Hill) but otherwise it's not much more than an okay time-waster.",5,3,6,3 October 2016
Dawn of the Dead," When there's no more room in hell...the zombie fun moves to earth!
","Now, THIS is a remake worth watching! Director Zack Snyder proves here that nowadays remakes don't necessarily have to be uninspired, overbudgetted productions meant only to make money at the expense of the original films. George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead was awfully close to being perfectAnd Snyder seems to realize this too! He didn't try to add (or change) anything to the substance of the film, but merely focuses on disgusting and amusing the audience. Respectively with filthy prosthetic make-up effects and some of the blackest humor you'll ever see. Without any explanation or logical cause, the dead are raised overnight. The reanimated corpses attack the living and once you're infectedyou become a zombie as well (notice that this word isn't used once in the movie, though). A group of survivors gather in the local mall and watch the place getting surrounded by an endless army of the bloodthirsty undead. At first, the remaining hillbillies keep themselves entertained by playing wicked games (shoot that Jay Leno look-alike!!) but soon the situation becomes more and more cul-de-sac and the growing internal intrigues result in dramatic, needless bloodshed.The atmosphere in Dawn of the Dead is light-headed, but Zack Snyder never really loses that brilliant apocalyptic touch. The feeling of hopelessness is upheld constantly and even wonderfully stressed by Johnny Cash' great song 'When the man comes around'. The film is filled with great references towards Romero's original, with the appearances of the original cast members as an absolute highlight. Initial zombie warriors Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger and Tom Savini all star briefly in this new version of Dawn. The main actors are worth praising as well. Ving Rhames was a great casting choice and the beautiful Sarah Polley impresses as the female lead. Snyder's style of film-making is loud and volatile, but it never becomes too irritant or boisterous. You can see his roots lie in shooting ads and commercials but he's obviously talented and capable of doing more. A comment I've heard a few times already is that this remake outshines the original. Of course it does NOT! Frankly, if you share this opinion you haven't got the slightest idea what the original stands for as a horror film. But it is terrific entertainment, for sure. I saw Dawn twice in the cinema already and I can't wait to buy it on DVD. Highly recommended horror fun!",8,2,10,5 July 2004
World War Z," Mother Nature is a serial killer And she wants to get caught!
","Remember when horror movies, and zombie flicks in particular, formed an exclusive niche looked down upon – and literally nearly spit upon – by Hollywood? Yeah, I miss those days too Ever since the modest British hits '28 Days Later' and 'Shaun of the Dead', zombie cinema turned into a big and profitable business. In less than a decade, we were literally overloaded with far too many uninspired zombie splatter flicks and incredibly lame zombie comedies. These days it's getting even worse, as the living dead have now also become mainstream material and we have A-list directors unleashing big-budgeted splatter flicks and former poster boy actors like Brad Pitt fanatically smashing zombies' brains! 'World War Z' fundamentally isn't a bad film, of course It benefices from its elite production values and its professional cast & crew. And since zombie movies used to be intended for restricted target audiences, I can imagine that the screenplay still has quite a lot of suspense and surprises to offer to the bigger movie-going public. However, if you have been watching zombie flicks your entire life already, the script of 'World War Z' has absolutely nothing original to offer and every next sequence or supposedly shocking revelation is very predictable. Horror fans will have seen it all before and numerous times, albeit realized with much smaller budgets and thus cheesier special effects In fact, not even that, because 'World War Z' evidently is a PG-13 movie and thus there isn't much carnage or bloodshed on display, and whenever Mr. Pitt crushes a zombie's face with a crowbar or something, it occurs off-screen. Every tiniest story detail about 'World War Z' is either preposterous or derivative. The virus outbreak and the subsequent mayhem in the busy streets of Philadelphia, the families torn apart, the quest for the virus' origin and the so-called patient zero and even Brad Pitt's groundbreaking solution to hold off the zombies it's all very predictable. And whenever the script isn't predictable, it's downright absurd, like for example Brad Pitt and his Jewish lady sidekick surviving a plane crash that cannot be survived. The quote in this user comment's subject line is spoken by an acclaimed virologist in the film, Dr. Fassbach, who's allegedly the savior of mankind and heads out to South Korea with a full team. He's clearly full of himself and thinks he's very intelligent, but then he trips and shoots himself through the head That actually was the best part of the film. That, and the Israeli zombie wall",5,0,0,1 October 2015
The Hunger Games," Big Cinema circus/hype that *almost* stilled my hunger
","I'm only in my early thirties, but extremely grumpy and old-fashioned for my age. I'm a giant admirer of classic horror/cult cinema and thus consequently a hater of everything that falls under the category of popular new teenage age trends, including remakes of classic horror movies and ridiculously over-hyped and phony franchises (like 'Twilight', for instance). I automatically assumed that 'The Hunger Games' would fall under this last subcategory and thus decided not to waste any time or money on it, but then it came on television and I had nothing better to watch, so what the hell. I must admit that I was quite entertained by this first movie in the franchise and – contrary to what I feared –compared to 'The Hunger Games', any entry in the 'Twilight' saga looks like an episode of the 'Teletubbies'. Obviously I still think this movie is tremendously overrated and I didn't like it enough in order to run out and immediately purchase all the other sequels right away, but at least I was pleasantly surprised by the overall grim & depressing atmosphere, the brutality of some of the death sequences and the execution of the basic story concept. Speaking of which, the plot is as old as cinema itself and absolutely doesn't anything original. Back in 1933 already, there was a fabulous movie that dealt about the hunting-humans formula – entitled 'The Most Dangerous Game' – and since then there came copious of rip-offs, imitations or variants. Some of them are cheap and dull ('Bloodlust!'), some of them are sleazy ('The Women Hunt'), some of them are extremely violent ('Blood Camp Thatcher') and some of them became legendary cult classics themselves ('Battle Royale'). Some of them already even integrated the sub plot of the hunting game being one giant reality TV show, like 'The Running Man' and Lucio Fulci's obscure piece of Sci-Fi trash 'The New Gladiators'. Basically that's all 'The Hunger Games' is; another umpteenth re-telling of 'The Most Dangerous Game', except this time it's based on a novel that all teenagers across the world have read and loved, so they think it's unique and groundbreaking. It's definitely innovating at all, but I'm already glad that it became a thriller with a a reasonably disturbing dystopian setting, a fair amount of suspense, intense situations and above average acting performances. Somewhere in the (not too distant) future, the nation of Panem – which is whatever is left over from the United States – is divided into 12 districts, ranged from proud and powerful to pitiable and poor. Once per year, the authorial president Snow organizes the 'hunger games'; a big media circus in which 24 randomly selected participants, two from each district, and unleashed into a wilderness where they battle each other to the death. In District 12, Katniss Everdeen volunteered to take the place of her younger sister, and she also happens to be a cool chick and a brilliant archer. There's quite a lot of additional blah blah and uninteresting sub plots, but I will admit that 'The Hunger Games' contains a handful of impressive action sequences in the jungle and even a few shocking moments in spite of its PG-13 rating. The apotheosis is utterly weak, which is inevitably I suppose, and the use of computer-engineered effects (the mutated dog- pack attack, for example) is terribly annoying, but perhaps this is all linked to me being a sourpuss. As for the remaining installments in the series, I will patiently wait until they get aired on TV as well.",6,1,1,16 February 2015
Mississippi Burning," Something's burning in Mississippi  and I think it's hatred!
","Recently, with my wife, I watched the 2011 film 'The Help' which is a truly brilliant movie that I can only recommend wholeheartedly. That same movie also sparked my desire to dig up some other terrific films about civil rights, and then it doesn't take too long before you end up at Alan Parker's 'Mississippi Burning'. Although nearly 30 years old now, this is still an immensely powerful and often shocking tale inspired by the real-life murders of 3 young activists by members of the Ku Klux Klan in a small Mississippian county in the spring of 1964. I'm European and there isn't too much known around here regarding the facts of this case, but I can easily imagine that turning this true crime case into a fairly large-scaled film production much have caused quite a bit of amok and controversy even 24 years later. Still, even though the references towards the so-called 'Mississippi civil right workers' murders' case are unmistakable, director Alan Parker primarily approaches the events from a more objective viewpoint by focusing on the FBI investigation. As the sudden disappearance of the 3 youngsters in rural Mississippi is considered alarming (perhaps because 2 of them are Caucasian), the FBI sends two agents over to the Magnolia State. Alan Ward is a young graduate and ambitious city agent who strictly follows the protocol, whereas Rupert Anderson is a former Mississippi small county sheriff himself and uses more unorthodox methods to find out the things he want. Needless to say their styles and personalities often clash, but it's Anderson who makes the most progress in the case, especially when he develops a tender – almost poetic, in fact – relationship with the wife of the sadist deputy (and KKK-member) Clinton Pell. Admittedly, you could blame director Alan Parker and scriptwriter Chris Gerolmo their excessive overuse of stereotypes All the FBI folks (except for Anderson) are uptight desk clerks with fancy suits, all the black people are mute victims, the women are docile and petrified wives and all the racist rednecks are ignorant and violent scumbags. Of course, just because the stereotypes are such opposites, the confrontations between them are extremely intense and atmospheric. The suspense literally mounts when the rednecks are relentlessly chasing an innocent black guy, or when Agent Anderson nonchalantly walks into the unofficial KKK clubhouse. Another reason why I personally don't mind the use of stereotypes is because it gives the fantastic cast the opportunity to showcase their talents. Awesomely talented guys like Michael Rooker, Brad Dourif and Pruit Taylor Vince are truly brilliant in depicting their vile and loathsome Southern redneck characters. But the greatest performance undeniably comes from Gene Hackman, as he almost naturally shapeshifts between hard-boiled law enforcer and tenderly comprehensive gentleman during his sequences with Frances McDormand. Another umpteenth brilliant performance from one of the greatest actors of the 70s, 80s and 90s.",8,0,2,19 September 2016
The 13th Warrior," WOO-HOO!! Viking-Violence!!!
","I'm really wondering why there aren't making more movies like this! What is in more interesting than the history of the Scandinavian countries? What is more fascinating than the tales of Northern myths and their legendary Gods?? Well, in my personal opinion, nothing is and that's why I was so enthusiast when I first heard about this Thirteenth Warrior being released! And even though I'll admit the film is flawed on several levels, I enjoyed it very much and I'd like to encourage as much people as possible to find out more about the North men and their intriguing history. Co-producer Michael Crichton who also wrote the screenplay bases the 13th Warrior on his own `Eaters of the Dead' novel. It's a tale of a banished Arab man who joins twelve North men on a conquest against an ancient form of evil. He learns their language and becomes a warrior during the journey, he fights along against the `Wendol'These are giant bear-like men who're extremely violent and savage. The good thing about The 13th Warriors is that it contains multiple impressive battle sequences and extremely interesting characters. For example the leader of the North men -  Buliwyf -  who's a truly overwhelming personality. The costumes and geographical settings are breath taking and perhaps even the most succeeded aspects in the entire production. And, of course, you can't tell a Viking tale without the use of explicit violencethe battles are pretty gruesome and the shed of blood is enormous. I didn't have a problem with that, though. I even love it but it might be something to keep under consideration when you have a weak stomach and you're planning to watch this film. Yet, it's only fair that I name a few of them negative elements The 13th Warrior suffers from. The largest parts of the script  and especially the dialogues  are very poorly written. The film also desperately tries to insert humor that is painfully unfunny and even embarrassing at times. Even the entire last battle scene may have been skipped since it's too heroic and a bit too much. Terrifically shot, though. Antonio Banderas will never be a class-A actor, neitherluckily for him, the accent works out well enough in stories like this. Nonetheless, The 13th Warrior is good entertainment and the background of it is food for education! Vikings rule!!",7,89,126,20 January 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Partly successful attempt to blend styles that are hard to blend.
","Okay, even though I surely don't regret having watched this film, I won't be joining the other reviewers around here who all claim it's a hilarious movie and/or the best horror comedy in decades. The intentions of cast and crew are good, there are plenty of good gags and the characters are likable but overall it feels like something is missing. It sure isn't obvious to mix a splatter-horror subgenre with comical situations so the premise of this 'Shaun of the Dead' doesn't work all the time. Nevertheless, there's enough ingeniousness and originality to make this a worthwhile film. The setting of a grey, banal London suburb with its typical inhabitants suits the story really well and the actors do their absolute best to provide this film with a human character. But it's not as hilarious as it looks and it's simply impossible to uphold a light-headed atmosphere when you're dealing with an apocalyptic theme. In case you're not familiar with the plot: 29-year-old Shaun is stuck in his monotonous life of dead-end job, nagging mother and lowlife roommate. His more ambitious girlfriend breaks up with him and just when he plans to make some serious changes to win her back, a mysterious disease resurrects the dead and turns the living into an endangered species. While the army of ravenous zombies keeps on growing, Shaun rescues his girl and some friends by bringing them to their favorite pub. Some of the gags (like when the gang learns to move like zombies in order to keep a low profile) are really good but the film is a bit too long and the drama eventually overrules the horror. Actually, the very best aspects in 'Shaun of the Dead' are the numerous references towards milestone zombie movies, but I fear these sublime findings are a bit lost on wider audiences. Shaun of the Dead brings homage to the Romero trilogy, The Evil Dead and many Italian classics. For true horror fans, it's a joy to track down all the subtle tributes. Overall, this gem sure is worth renting but the hype in enjoys at the moment is a bit unmerited.",7,12,26,28 November 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A giant, thrilling roller coaster-ride, indeed
","To be totally honest...I didn't join the hype and the worldwide enthusiasm when this movie was first announced. I was actually worried when I saw the names of Johnny Depp and Jerry Bruckheimer listed together on one movie-poster ! I always looked at Johnny Depp as he is Hollywood's last 'rebel' and seeing him in a big budget production ( like the average Bruckheimer film is) would mean we've lost him too. By 'rebel' I mean that he chooses the roles he really WANTS to play. For himself or for his Hollywood friends ( like Tim Burton for example ) So, in that way, I'm glad to admit I was wrong. Johnny kept his own personal style and personality in this movie. The big money and the huge hype surely hasn't changed his way of film-making. Pirates of the Caribbean is indeed on of the most enjoyable films coming from the last few years and a must see to everyone who likes an original and well made movie. But I wouldn't go so far to call it a masterpiece already. I even saw they've included this film in the list of '250 best movies ever' here on this website...That may be a bit soon, I guess. I prefer to await its status within a few years whether to include it or not.But hey, no complaints from me neither... I saw it 3 times so far and loved every single viewing. Making a good movie about pirates is some sort of achievement to itself, actually. This topic seemed to be 'cursed' to itself ( oh, sweet irony ) because the last attempts of telling a story about pirates all resulted in complete failures. Cuttroat Island by director Renny Harlin was a complete disaster and it messed up the career of Geena Davis. Even the brilliant director Roman Polanski didn't succeed in making an interesting movie about pirates when he tried it, back in 1986. Upcoming talent Gore Verbinski ( his version of the Ring was quite good as well) did succeed and I find this to be quite remarkable...especially when you consider the basic idea behind this film is a roller coaster-ride from Disney Wold.Yes, Johnny Depp is great in it. I said it already and he got lots of praising all over the world for his role, so I think it's not necessary to mention him again. We all know Geoffrey Rush is an overtalented actor and Orlando Bloom is well on his way to build up a great career as well ( not many actors his age can say they starred in 4 of the biggest box office hits of all time, even though 3 of them are part of a trilogy ). I didn't know Keira Knightly yet but she looks cute. In general, I think we can say the acting is flawless. There are also enough fascinating plot twists and funny moments in Pirates of the Caribbean thus it's certainly recommended !! I'd already recommend it if it were  for the used language alone !! I love expressions like ' Ye'd be lost to Davey Jones' Locker' and several other, typical sayings. But if you really think there's absolutely nothing negative to say about this film, I suggest you stop reading now because I do have a few minor comments on it. First of all there the CGI, I complain about this matter on most modern films, but that's because it bugs me so much. I'm still convinced it's possible to create a visual stunning film without the overuse of computer effects but this movie didn't try to do so. Maybe it's for the best, otherwise many (younger) fans wouldn't have liked it. And I do think this motion picture is a bit like its title...too long. I'm not saying it becomes boring but 145 minutes is a bit long to tell the story in my opinion. Furthermore...no remarks. Off you go...watch this film !!!",7,1,3,9 September 2003
12 Angry Men," From 1 against 11 to 11 against 1 in one the most brilliant films in history!
","I do not often start my reviews with blunt and opinionated statements, but in this case, it's justified. '12 Angry Men' is righteously considered as one of the top 5 most genius movies ever made! I realize it changes quite frequently, but at the time I'm writing this user-comment, Sidney Lumet's amazing debut film is #5 in the IMDb Top 250! That's a fantastic accomplishment, especially if you consider this film is more than sixty years old, doesn't feature any computer-engineered special effects and hasn't got any geeky cult followings that dress up like the lead characters. Heck, if you take out the everlasting and manipulated feud between 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Godfather', this '12 Angry Men' may even be the REAL #1! But '12 Angry Men' deserves all the superlatives you could possible use to describe it. Everything about this film is perfect, and if there's one film that literally everybody should be obliged to watch at least once in his/her lifetime, I think it ought to be this one. The original story by Reginal Rose is wondrously absorbing, intelligent, intense and still incredibly relevant even after 60 years. Rose's own adaptation into a movie screenplay is also amazing, with not a single word or piece of dialogue too much or too few. The ensemble cast exists of twelve hyper-professional actors that each give away one of the most impeccable performances of their careers; most notable Henry Fonda as the humane hero, Lee J. Cobb as the dogmatic narcissist and E.G. Marshall as the rigorous pundit. But the biggest geniuses remain director Sidney Lumet and his cameraman Boris Kaufman. If you think that a film that for 99% takes place in one and the same room will inevitably become boring and monotonous, just wait and look what brilliant opportunities there exist in terms of camera angles, lighting, zoom functions and sweat stains!",10,1,2,22 July 2018
Hostel," Bring out the East-European Gimps...
","'Hostel' only just got released and it's already a bit overrated. Well...over-hyped might be a better term to use, as Eli Roth's follow-up to the crappy 'Cabin Fever' is an overall intense horror flick and it definitely reaches its basic goal; which is to disgust and even shock younger audiences. Eli Roth and producer Quinten Tarantino aren't exactly known for their subtlety and thus 'Hostel' is quite a sick and unhinged movie that leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. Not even during the bloodless first half hour, when numerous beautiful girls go topless and the film looks an awful lot like vulgar teen-comedies such as 'American Pie' or 'Road Trip'! Two Americans and an Icelander, all driven by their hormones, travel through Europe with only sex and soft drugs on their minds. After a disappointing party in Amsterdam, a fellow stoner advises them to travel further east where the girls are stunningly beautifully and  oh yes  very willing. The hostel in Slovakia starts out as a dream location but, soon after, the horny boys one by one get kidnapped and gruesomely tortured in a ramshackle old factory. The idea and structure behind the torture-network isn't particularly original or innovating, but since it's the only form of depth and plotting in the film's entire script, I won't be the one ruining it for you already (although other reviewers obviously have no problem with that...). Admittedly you have to be a little sick in the head, but I really enjoyed the extended and genuinely sadistic torture sequences and the devices looked creepy. Eli Roth will probably never be a great filmmaker, but his directing skills have seemly improved since 'Cabin Fever', as there are some stylish camera angles and a nifty use of locations. The almighty Tarantino's influence is clearly detectable in smaller aspects, like twisted gags and clever references towards other movies (like his own masterpiece 'Pulp Fiction'). The ending is really good and the film once more proves that ordinary CHILDREN are the most petrifying creatures on the planet! Worth seeing.",6,3,7,11 March 2006
Green Room," Punk is not dead! But the punk band soon will be
","Since the release of his previous film 'Blue Ruin' and even more so now with 'Green Room', literally everyone is glorifying the writing and directing skills of Jeremy Saulnier and refers to him as one of the best young directors of a new generation. But hey, wait a minute I've known his name for much longer. I watched Saulnier's debut movie 'Murder Party' shortly after its release in 2007  and truly hated it! I dug up my user comment from back then and it even seems that I impolitely described Mr. Saulnier as an untalented and uninspired amateur director who probably shouldn't quit his regular job in order to purchase his dream of becoming a famous horror director. Ha! Well, I have been wrong before many times in my life and don't have any problem whatsoever with admitting that I judged too soon. I still haven't seen 'Blue Ruin' yet, but 'Green Room' is definitely a very enjoyable and recommendable action flick/thriller and the progress Saulnier made here in comparison to 'Murder Party' is downright stupendous. The basic plot is very familiar and derivative of approximately 80% of all action movies ever made, but that's perfectly fine because the setting is original, the main characters are likable and the practically non- stop action footage is exhilarating and intense! The four amiable members of the amateur punk band 'Aren't Rights' find them severely outnumbered against a whole posse of skinheads when, after an improvised gig in a remote club, they witnessed something they shouldn't have and are subsequently forced to battle for survival. The band is trapped inside the dressing room with just one gun and a very uncooperative hostage, while outside the skinheads are crowding up with whole arsenals of firearms, machetes and especially trained attack dogs. There are a couple of nicely unexpected twists and very ingenious ideas in Saulnier's screenplay, like for example a staged stabbing in order to mislead the police and the sublime choice to cast Patrick Stewart as the ruthless but simultaneously safety-obsessed villainous leader. 'Green Room' isn't really a horror movie but a very brutal thriller, and there are quite a lot of sequences that will be hard to watch for squeamish folks. The dog attacks, for instance, are gruesome to say the least and then there are also shotgun executions at close range and nasty acts committed with a box cutter. Saulnier surrounded himself with quite an impressive cast, especially for such a violent movie. Apart from the almighty Patrick Stewart, there's also Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots. Macon Blair, who has been working with Jeremy Saulnier since 'Murder Party' and also played the lead role in 'Blue Ruin' here receives a very significant supportive role.",7,4,11,10 April 2016
The Babadook," The Ba-Ba-Ba, the Dook-Dook-Dook, that's all we need to scare you with!
","You always need to be wary and skeptical of new horror movies that are coming out and instantly receive unanimously praising reviews from the press and international festival juries. Journalist have quota, festivals need positive publicity, and in the end, you are left behind feeling disappointed and ripped off. I also can't help thinking that our quality norms and standards for horror movies have severely lowered over the past decade. In recent years I've seen numerous horror movies that are world-widely labeled as original, genuinely terrifying and atmospheric, like 'The Conjuring', 'Don't Breathe', 'The Witch', 'It', 'A Quiet Place' or 'Get Out'. Don't get me wrong, ALL of these are more than adequate, clever and recommendable horror/thriller films, but NONE of them are the mind-blowing and astoundingly petrifying masterpieces that their ratings or reviews suggest.Does this statement also apply to 'The Babadook'? Yes and no, I'd say. 'The Babadook' is definitely a different and less conventional type of supernatural horror story. Writer/director Jennifer Kent clearly didn't feel obliged or pressured to make a traditional and mainstream blockbuster, and even downright refuses the use of typical genre cliches like false scares, polished and attractive lead characters or textbook villains/monsters. The ultimate proof of her devoted intentions, I think, is the fact that she keeps ownership of the film's legal rights just to prevent that someone will ever make a sequel. How exceptional is that in the horror industry? What Jennifer Kent did bring to the screen with 'The Babadook' is a very personal, tangible and harrowing family drama that utmost benefices from its slow-pacing, foreboding atmosphere, bleak filming style and majestic performances (Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman). As to be expected from a psychological horror tale of this allure, it's a film with many layers; ambiguous and open for various interpretations.Is the Babadook real or a fragment of the two emotionally troubled protagonists' imaginations? To be quite honest, I don't know. I'm not necessarily seeking out intellectual or thought-provoking cinema. I already have a lot of thinking to do for my job and I try to contemplate more deeply about raising my children, but I don't feel the desire to over-analyze every scary movie that I watch. I do tend to concur with the fellow reviewers who see 'The Babadook' as an allegory on unprocessed traumas, everlasting guilt, difficult childhood years and the lack of strong role models. What matters is that Jennifer Kent masterfully brings the titular monster to life in a subtle yet unsettling fashion, and that both Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman empower its frightening existence through their stellar performances. Especially Davis is astounding, and I caught myself thinking stuff like: 'Get some sleep, you poor woman') several times. 'The Babadook' perhaps isn't the masterpiece that certain reviews claim it to be, but it's a truly impressive film and a must-see for genre fanatics. Jennifer Kent is familiar with the genuine masterpieces of horror, by the way, because her film contains footage of Mario Bava's 'Black Sabbath/I Tre Volti Della Paura'.",7,1,4,16 January 2019
Knives Out," Pimp My Agatha Christie!
","With the exception of my wife and daughter, and possibly my mother, Agatha Christie is the woman whom I love most on this planet. She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with 'Knives Out', writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It's abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie's typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of 'Knives Out' is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.Daniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners, hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch Harlan Thrombey. It looks like suicide, but literally every greedy member of Harlan's bloodline had a motive for killing and - also in delightful Agatha Christie tradition - the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive, compelling as well as humorous, complex but simultaneously light-headed and 200% entertaining. The cast is phenomenal. Craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, and the Thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette, Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson. 'Knives Out' is perhaps slightly too long, but never tedious, and very well-directed by Rian Johnson (who honestly doesn't deserve all this hatred from disappointed 'Star Wars' geeks)",8,207,309,18 December 2019
The Secret in Their Eyes," True romance is about  suffering
","I was curious and intrigued, but mostly skeptical when I first read the brief description of 'The Secret in their Eyes' in a TV- magazine. It stated: 'a romantic thriller about the unresolved rape and murder case of a beautiful girl 25 years ago'. Huh? How can a thriller, especially one dealing with such painful topics like rape and murder, be romantic? And yet, the description is 100% accurate and truthful. This harsh thriller is simultaneously one of the most emotional stories that I ever witnessed and it's romantic at no less than three different levels! There's the obvious but oppressed romance between lead character Benjamin Esposito and his court superior Irene Hastings, and then there's also the more convoluted but undeniably romantic devotion that widower Ricardo Morales shows for his murdered wife and the perverted (but yet somehow romantic) motive of culprit Isidoro Gómez for committing the inhuman crime. One things for sure, 'The Secret in their Eyes' is one of the most absorbing, beautiful and unforgettable films of the new millennium. I was wondering how on earth it could be possible that Michael Haneke's masterful 'The White Ribbon' didn't win the Oscar for best foreign film for 2009, but now it makes perfect sense. Those people at the Academy were more than right to award this film instead! 'The Secret in their Eyes' deserves every price that it won and it also deserves to be seen by as many people as humanly possible! In 1974, the beautiful and lovable Liliana Coloto is found brutally raped and murdered by someone that she obviously must have known and trusted. The crime is so vile and shocking that it even silences the experienced court room counselor Benjamin Esposito. With the help of his alcoholic but brilliant colleague Sandoval and his new supervisor Irene, whom he's desperately in love with, Esposito identifies the unmistakable culprit and promises Liliana's grieving widower Ricardo that he will spend the rest of his life in jail. But the assumed killer is released shortly after due to internal courtroom corruption and personal vendettas and Esposito narrowly survives an assassination attempt. 25 years later, the retired Esposito travels back to Buenos Aires with the intention of writing a novel about this case that altered his life. He goes to see Irene Hastings, who built out an impressive career over the years, and notices that his old feelings are still as strong and irresistible as before. In all honesty, the more you contemplate about the plot and analyze the events afterwards, the less plausible and realistic 'The Secret in their Eyes' becomes. And yet, for once this doesn't matter because you are so moved by the story and feel so much sympathy for the main characters that you'll gladly overlook any flaws that only come to the surface later. Apart from the story and the unique mixture of styles and genres, there are two other aspects that make this film a genuine masterpiece, namely the acting performances and the cinematography. Regarding the acting, being a European I don't know any of the actors and actresses in this film, but they surely all made a big impression on me. The camera work by Félix Monti is stupendous, with various great sequences in which he achieved beautiful effects through reflection (in mirrors or windows) and extended pan-images.",9,4,5,1 June 2015
Finding Nemo," Yes, it's THAT good !!
","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.
I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations. Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",8,190,239,10 December 2003
Hot Fuzz," Brilliant! It's got everything ...
","And I really do literally mean EVERYTHING you could possibly crave to find in a relaxing and genuinely entertaining cinema experience! 'Hot Fuzz' brilliantly combines the wittiness & fast dialogs of a buddy cop movie, the excitement & spectacular stunts of a Hollywood summer blockbuster, the absurdity & convoluted plot twists of an Italian Giallo, the excessive gore and sickness of splatter-horror, the atmosphere & setting of a British comedy sitcom and the cast of a thousand. If all this isn't enough yet, 'Hot Fuzz' refers to multiple great classics of the big screen ('Jaws', 'The Wicker Man', 'Straw Dogs') and even pays tribute to styles and sub genres of the almost forgotten but once golden days of cinema (Spaghetti Westerns, Gialli). For those who were still suspecting 'Shaun of the Dead', the previous scripting collaboration between Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, to be a fluke, 'Hot Fuzz' will take the doubt away once and for all. These two British lads are creative and multi-talented movie freaks and they know exactly how the please a wide & versatile range of audiences. The less you know about the film's plot (particularly the main twist) the better, because it's even more amusing when it comes as a totally unexpected and deliciously grotesque surprise. Simon Pegg stars as London's super cop Nicholas Angel, but he's actually too good in comparison with the rest of the corps, and so his superiors shamelessly transfer him to the countryside community with the lowest crime-rate in the whole of England; Sandford. Nick's new colleagues aren't used to solving crimes at all and fill their days with hanging around the pubs, smoking cigarettes and making fun of his obsession with law enforcement. Even when several prominent Sandford inhabitants die in grisly 'accidents', Nick can't seem to convince them to investigate the possibility of murder. The eventual truth behind the crimes is as demented as it is brilliant, and the last half hour of 'Hot Fuzz' is a simply non-stop adrenalin-rushing, over-the-top comical, blood-spattered and wildly cheerful spitfire of action highlights. Technically speaking, 'Hot Fuzz' is a masterpiece as well. The editing is genius, the cinematography is very imaginative and the film makes absolute brilliant use of the rural settings and all its typical characteristics and clichés. Of course, the film owes a large part of its massive impact to Simon Pegg's masterful performance. He's simply awesome and hugely charismatic, especially when depicting the obstinate and firm officer who knows every tiniest detail of the law enforcement book. Pegg's facial expressions (or lack of, for that matter) add even more comical genius to the already hysterical script. The supportive cast (pretty much an assembly of England's finest players) is amazing as well, and each and every one delivers flawless performances. I think Timothy Dalton hasn't had this much fun starring in a film since he completed his first scene wearing the James Bond outfit. 'Hot Fuzz' is a unique experience all together. It features all the known genre clichés & stereotypes and narrates a seemingly derivative story, and yet, the elaboration is (or at least feels like) something entirely fresh and original. Comedy and violence can melt together in a movie perfectly, it simply requires a gifted team of cast and crew members. Highly recommended! Seriously, if you haven't watched 'Hot Fuzz' yet, do it as fast as you can!",10,3,6,6 October 2007
The Mummy," Well...at least the computer effect-guys had fun.
","Small spoilers coming up....This is the second review I write about the same topic. The cursed priest Imhotep and his forbidden love for Anck-Su-Namun. A wonderful story and one of the most magnificent tales ever told in my opinion. But, to my regret, this review will be a lot less favourable than the ones I did for the 1932 version.First of all, actor Arnold Vosloo had the unrewarding task to follow into the footsteps of the greatest actor who ever lived....Boris Karloff played the mummy in the original version and to his style and appearance can never be lived up to. In another great Ancient Egypt-story, Christopher Lee portrayed a mummy as well ( he was called Kharis, if I'm not mistaken) so being a worthy follow-up to those 2 screen legends, Arnold Vosloo fails enormously. In fact, he's not a very well known actor at all, I only recognized him from the inferior Darman sequels. That was negative element number one, but so far...I hadn't lost all hope yet. No, that happened when the CGI came along... Such a shame...this version is obviously made for a complete other kind of audience. Young people mostly, I think...the computer generation. I'm not that old or something but I prefer the old-fashioned make-up effects a lot more. There's no love in this version at all and no matter what they may say : Not one computer generated effect has the ability to scare people. The mummy ( especially in his most early phase of decomposition ) is laughable and some of the most unrealistic things I ever saw....Furthermore: the sandstorms, the bugs, the servants of Imhotep etc, they're all a waste of money. One look in the eyes of good old Boris Karloff and you're frightened a 100 times more. The whole traditional story of Imhotep is explained in the first 5 minutes and the last 10...all what's in between is a useless story about treasure hunters looking for the lost city of Hamunaptra and 'Americans vs British'-jokes... There are a lot more ( smaller ) aspects about this movie that bugged me, too. For example, the huge amout of comedy in it. I love a good oneliner from time to time but this is just way over the top. I don't have much to say about the acting performances. Brendan Frasier is one of the few actors that I don't care about at all. I don't think he sucks nor do I think he's good. Neutral guy in my opinion. He did make a lot of bad films, but I don't think he was ever to blame for it. I did like Airheads in wich he starred, but in that one Steve Buscemi totally steals the show. I don't care much about Rachel Weisz neither...she looks cute from time to time, that's all. Now, this review could be taken as very positive too. If you like modern horror with an overload of CGI, instead of good plot twists...I highly recommend it. If you've got any sense of tradition or myth, avoid it. Stephen Sommers totally wasted a piece of true art here. And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse than this, he comes along with the Mummy Returns. I still hate myself for watching that...The Mummy was bad, the Mummy Returns was a complete disaster. My humble opinion...2/10",3,1,6,4 September 2003
Constantine," From pitch black class to pure camp!
","I'm always up for a story about that handles about demons and darkness, so I was pretty enthusiast in anticipating this 'Constantine'. It's the third comic book adaptation in row that centers on a anti-hero (after 'Hellboy' and 'The Punisher'), men that are really not too keen on the supernatural powers they developed or were born with. John Constantine is a sinister private eye, capable of whooping demon-butt back to the depths of hell. His duty is to keep an eye on 'halflings', beings that attempt to cross over the borders of heaven, hell and earth. When Constantine is approached by police woman Angela Dobson for help concerning the strange suicide case of her twin sister, they slowly discover that Satan's son is preparing his arrival on earth. Many people around this website seem to hold a grudge against Keanu Reeves but I really liked him in this role. The 'you-don't-like-it-go-to-hell' attitude really suits him! Unlike many other 'critics' here, I really enjoyed the first hour of 'Constantine' as it features a constantly ominous atmosphere, sublime black humor and even a few efficient and impressive shock moments (the cows!!). The images of hell, or simply the use of special effects in general, is well considered and very compelling while the interactions between Reeves and fellow unearthly creatures often leads to terrific kitschy fun. Unfortunately, but almost evidently, director Lawrence can't keep up this quality-level and the film sinks deep towards the worthless camp section. The twists then become more ridiculous, the cheese factor increases and the effects become more and more flamboyant. The only real aspect to enjoy during the second hour is a glorious OTT appearance by Peter Stormare (Fargo, 8mm) as Lucifer. 'Constantine' sure isn't the turkey many people here claim it to be, but by no means it's an essential milestone, neither.",6,4,33,27 February 2005
The Others," Subtle, genuinely creepy and ... SUBTLE
","The Others is a very remarkable film from more than just one viewpoint. In an era where you can only impress young horror fanatics with bucket-loads of blood and gross-out effects, Amenábar actually re-teaches his audience that fear is especially caused by suggestion and the absence of explicit images. The Others is the first intelligent horror film in years, completely relying on atmosphere and eerie set pieces. It's such a relief to finally see a subtle film that is also effective! I'm normally not much of Nicole Kidman fan but she's very convincing as the prudish, over-concerned mother who desperately tries to protect her children from the outside world (daylight in particular). She lives in a remote mansion and waits, along with her 2 children, for WWII to be over. With the arrival of 3 servants, strange events star to occur in the old house and the daughter spots 'intruders' everywhere. The screenplay - by Amenábar himself - is not totally unique (filmfreaks who're familiar with expressionism highlights from the 60's will quickly guess the hidden plot twist) but it's filled with ingenious findings and sublime dialogues. The Others reminds you of 'The Innocents' and there are far worse films to get compared with, if you ask me! What also is rather amazing about this production is that Amenábar seems so confident! This is his first giant Hollywood adventure with stars in the cast and American money and yet he has total control over everything. The acting is great, the plot actually scares you and the directing is solid. The Others is a total winner and easily one of the greatest genre-films of the last few decades.",8,231,261,4 November 2004
Troy," Gigantic epic! But, with the ability to entertain all kind of audiences for a change.
","Usually, I'm really skeptical and negative-minded about these massively hyped and overbudgetted historical epics. I have a lot more sympathy for modest and truthful portraits as they focus more on the actual events instead of the computerized decoration. Productions like these don't come much bigger than `Troy', but still it's a good movie with an enormous entertainment value and lots of professionalism. As far as the history-lessons I attended in school are fresh in my mind, Troy is rather loyal to the original poem and only a few changes and additions have been made in order to make the film more attractive to the audience. Orlando Bloom's character Paris is portrayed a lot less cowardly than he actually was and the whole love affair between him and Helen is wrongfully glorified. Other than these slick twists, the film gives a pretty good image to those who aren't familiar with the legendary tale. Letting Wolfgang Petersen direct this epic was a good choice. Petersen is very gifted director with extremely professional visions and the required skills shoot an appealing blockbuster. Brilliant cast as well, with some prominent names like Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson and Peter O'Toole. Brad Pitt is a lot less miscast as I initially feared and Eric Bana continues his triumph career. I haven't got an opinion on Orlando Bloom yet. I'll patiently await his first non-blockbuster role before judging his acting skills. The settings and scenery are amazingly impressive, the numerous battles are more than exciting and the bloodshed is fairly reasonable. All together, Troy isn't the type of film I'll immediately buy on DVD when it comes out, but at least it doesn't leave you behind unsatisfied and mixed feelings.",5,3,9,24 May 2004
Ed Wood," A masterpiece about failure
","It's truly ironic that Tim Burton was able to make such a great masterpiece out of the life story of Edward D. Wood Jr. The least you can say is that his life wasn't. What makes this film so great is that Burton never makes fun of Ed Wood. His way of film-making, his lifestyle and his vision of things are always shown with respect. It's obvious that Burton didn't intend to make a comedy about Hollywood, but a drama about a man with a dream to make films. And he won't give up that dream, no matter what. I'm a great fan of Tim Burton. Especially when he casts Johnny Depp in the leading role. Edward Sciccorhands, Sleepy Hollow and this Ed Wood can easily make the top 50 films of ALL TIME. There's chemistry on the screen, when those 2 work together. And Johnny is not alone this time. The Oscar that Martin Landau received for his role of Bela Lugosi is perhaps one of the most deserved ones in the history of the Academy Awards. He's very creepy as the washed up actor, but very pathetic at the same time. It really is an outstanding performance. Patricia Arquette is just adorable as Kathy, the woman who stays with Edward in good and bad days. She's always giving him support, believes in him, accepts him as he is ( his confession to her in the spook house is really heartbreaking ) Lisa Marie is really sexy as Vampire. People can think she receives all her roles because she sleeps with the director, but she really can act. Very well as the matter a fact. One little disappointment maybe, I was hoping the role of Orson Welles ( played by Vincent D'Onofrio - one genius plays another one ) would have been a little bigger. 'Ed Wood' is one of the best films of the 90's... what am I saying ? One of the best films EVER !!!",10,23,25,3 June 2003
Orphan," From Russia With Terror!
","Each year I try to attend a couple of Film Festivals in the hope to stumble upon obscure, international and experimental genre movies that normally don't reach wide audiences, but the absolute best film I watched at this year's edition of the Brussels International Festival of Fantastic Film was this relatively 'mainstream' horror effort. 'Orphan' is a traditional and largely predictable thriller with familiar themes and numerous of inevitable clichés, but nevertheless it's great entertainment thanks to a continuously suspenseful atmosphere and sublime acting performances from the ensemble cast. Evil, murderous children still somewhat form the last taboo in the horror industry, especially if there isn't a straightforward explanation for their malignant behavior, but more than once they guaranteed nail-biting suspense and genuine scares already. 'Orphan' reminded me most of the little-known early 90's thriller 'Mikey', since both films deal with cherubic but evil-minded murdering their adoption families, but this one is far more elaborated, sinister and engaging. The not always happily married couple John and Kate Coleman want to compensate the loss of their third stillborn baby by adopting a child from Sister Abigail's orphanage. They promptly fall in love with the 9-year-old Esther, an incredibly polite and eloquent girl with a somewhat peculiar dressing style and Russian roots. They take her home and hope to raise the perfect family with her and the other two kids, Daniel and the deaf/mute little girl Maxine. Esther quickly sows fear and terror in school and around the playground, but the other children are too petrified to betray her. When Kate also accuses Esther of being a demonic child, her husband and therapist blame it on her alcoholic background and hallucinations. Meanwhile Esther's vile acts become increasingly horrific and more diabolical. It's good to finally see another horror movie that features all the known and dreadful clichés, but you don't allow them to bother you. Quite the contrary, they even work! You know there will come a scene in which Esther is standing quietly in the bedroom staring at her little unsuspecting sleeping sister, but when the scene finally comes it still sends cold shivers down your spine. You also know that it won't be easy to defeat Esther in the finale, but still you jump up in your seat with fear every time she pops up again. That is called genuine suspense, and it works so effectively because we truly care for the good characters and gradually build up an aversion towards the despicable child Esther. The script patiently – the film lasts 123 minutes which is quite long for a horror film – takes its time to draw a detailed image of the Coleman family situation, which makes it practically impossible not to cheer for them. During the last half hour, when you assume Esther already unleashed all of her demons, the story still holds a couple of shocking twists in store regarding her personality and background. 'Orphan' is brought to an even higher quality level thanks to all the brilliant acting performances. Peter Sarsgaard and Vera Farmiga are excellent as the struggling couple, but the most remarkable performances come from the youthful actresses Aryana Engineer (as the adorable little sister Maxine) and of course Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther. She's really amazing and 100% terrifying, with her penetrating eyes and macabre karma. Just have one look at the film's poster image and you'll know exactly what I mean. Great film, highly recommended to ALL horror-loving audiences.",9,2,10,25 April 2010
The Day After Tomorrow," My stone-cold opinion...
","We all know about Roland Emmerich's uncontrollable desire to destroy the world  New York in particular  by now. After unleashing Roswell'47 aliens (Independence Day) and a giant Japanese salamander (Godzilla) upon NY, Emmerich now finds inspiration in the global warming problems. What if  a sudden new Ice Age presented itself? The basic premise of `The Day after Tomorrow' is much more logical and realistic than Emmerich's previous films, thus therefore the whole disaster takes place in a period of only a week! So far so good I mean, you can't judge a film negatively because it's far fetched. The whole thing may be scientifically unjustified, but it has to remain a little appealing to the audience, no? The dreadfulness of this film lies in the same old, disastrous clichés that keep on getting repeated over and over again. The characters couldn't be more stereotypical and the oppressed sentiment is so fake you'll feel the urge to vomit. Dennis Quaid is the dedicated workaholic who got estranged from his wife and son, but in times of need, he walks thousand of miles through snow in order to save to save his boy. And do you think he'll make it??? It gets worse The quiet, introvert boy heroically saves his girl while the boisterous older colleague sacrifices his own life by cutting the rope. And that poor, poor little cancer patientDo you think they'll be just in time to save him??? If that isn't exaggerated and fake enough, the film ends with a giant moralistic and ethical speech by the brand new President of the U.S of A. Granted, The Day after Tomorrow stuns quite a few times with amazingly impressive bad-weather effects. The professionalism of the special effects department would have been terrific if it weren't for the computer engineered wolves. They look so primitive they belong in a Stephen Sommers movie, actually. The last (positive) comment goes out to young actress Emmy Rossum. She's a beautiful teen actress who obviously has the required talent in her. I hope to see her starring in many (better) films after this. She's much better than most other cast-members, including Dennis Quaid who merely looks like a cheap Harrison Ford clone here. Jake Gyllenhaal  apparently still able to play a 17-year-old adolescent  isn't bad, but modest and intelligent films like his Donnie Darko deserve my respect a lot more than this. If you have nothing better to do with your time (when it's freezing outside or something), The Day after Tomorrow is a fair time-waster. Otherwise, it should just be skipped.",2,8,16,30 May 2004
The Prestige," LOVED the trick with the canary!
","Performing magic shows is literally a 'tricky' business. Unquestionably these magicians are good artists, as they have to disguise a presumably very simple and logical trick and build a whole show around it, but at the same time the whole concept quickly tends to get boring. Just because you automatically presume there's a simple explanation for every illusion, you risk losing interest and I was more or less worrying that the movie would suffer from this exact same problem. It isn't very interesting to hear Michael Caine enlightening us about the different phases of a successful trick and it's even less interesting to constantly hear about two beginning magicians wanting to become the biggest performers of their time. Personally, I wasn't really hoping for a thriller revealing a lot of magic-secrets. I was merely anticipating a dark & sinister post-Gothic portrait revolving personal vendettas and macabre set pieces. And for the largest part, The Prestige actually delivers! The man in the director's chair is Christopher Nolan, and both 'Memento' and 'Insomnia' already proved he's a terrific storyteller, as he has the talent to bring an ordinary tale much more complex than it actually is. Nolan once again uses as irregular narrative structure, with jumps back and forward into time and well-camouflaged hints that eventually all lead to a gigantically grotesque denouement. Robert Angier (Hugh 'Wolverine' Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian 'Batman Begins' Bale) are two gifted pupils of the already legendary 'engineer' Cutter (Michael Caine), both treasuring the ambition to become the nation's biggest magician. A regretful accident, resulting in Angier's wife tragic death on stage, causes their friendship to turn into intense competition and pretty soon they spend even more time sabotaging each other's shows than actually building up their own acts. When Alfred Borden eventually presents his perplexing Transported Man trick and Angier can't possibly decipher the logic behind it, the rivalry turns into a dangerous obsession that will require large sacrifices. The main attraction of this film is probably meant to be the guessing along for the tricks and the detailed exposition of a handful of basic magical acts, but honestly that whole aspect impressed me the least. With just a tad bit of concentration and the experience of having seen similar mystery-thrillers, the red herrings are fairly transparent. Also, the whole set-up of Robert Angiers ultimate act (with the help of pop star David Bowie in a remarkable role) is simply impossible to take serious. Whatever remains, however, is definitely worth watching. The mysterious late 19th Century set pieces are intriguing, especially the transporting machinery which seems to be inspired by the 'telepods' in David Cronenberg's 'The Fly'. The detailed illustration of magical tricks didn't really fascinate me, although there's one notable exception: the disappearing canary! It's a cruel and pretty offensive old-school trick, but hilarious in case you have a weird sense of humor. Quite embarrassing, because I was the ONLY person in a sold-out theater who was laughing with this sequence. The acting performances are top-notch, but with an ensemble cast like this we wouldn't accept it any other way. Particularly Christian Bale is terrific, since his naturally mysterious charisma is ideal for a role as a magician. Scarlett Johansson's part is rather small, but her beautiful appearance helps cheering up the dark sets a lot.",6,0,6,15 January 2007
The Terminator," Immortal Science-Fiction! A relentless milestone here to stay
","Great ideas are made for great moviesand James Cameron's `the Terminator' is an all-time classic. The plot is one immense paradox and you either love or hate the ultra-apocalyptic and sadistic theme of this film. But, even when you completely loathe the premise, you'll still always have to admit that The Terminator is one of the most imaginative scripts ever written. Dig this: the futuristic rulers of the world anno 2029 send back a robot in time, to the year 1984, with only one goal. Kill the mother of the great future freedom fighter before he's even born. And the father of this great hero is a soldier, sent after the cyborg, to prevent him from fulfilling his mission. If this isn't ingenious, nothing is! And, above this, The Terminator is a very diverse film as well. It's a shocking thriller (the hunt for Sarah Connor) as well as a dared, intense drama (the huge load of innocent victims). And with compelling horror moments as well! The film is purely brilliant and Arnold finally gets to play the role he was born for. The Terminator is a triumph for the low-budget film industry and one of the most essential movies of all times. A must for all kind of cinema admirers.",10,1,7,3 August 2004
Cloverfield," It Came From ... Who knows, who cares?
","Okay, once again it seems as if I missed out on a gigantic hype and once more I do not at all seem to comprehend the huge success of this superficially attractive but eventually bland and substantially void hybrid between an amateur YouTube video and a massively budgeted monster flick. The short trailers and secretive teaser clips didn't miss their effect, as 'Cloverfield' quickly became one of the most anticipated movies ever, but does the finished product really live up to the beforehand promoted hype? That's a big fat 'NO', in my humble opinion, because all I saw was an overlong (at barely 85 minutes, can you imagine), preposterous and pretentious blockbuster with very few redeeming qualities. This isn't a monster movie at all. Admittedly I might be a bit biased because I swear by the monster flicks and alien invasion movies from the fifties and early sixties, but at least they were charming and spectacular in a non-exploitative fashion. For the action and mayhem in their film 'Cloverfield', Matt Reeves and Drew Goddard obviously cash in on the fear & paranoia caused by the 9/11 tragedy. People nervously and hectically force their way through collapsing skyscrapers and giant clouds of dust, unaware of what happened exactly, yet they resolutely continue to register their own misery and agony on a digital hand-held camera. That's like shamelessly promoting voyeurism and gratuitously manipulating people's deepest fears. And yet, whenever parts of buildings are falling down for (still) unknown reasons, 'Cloverfield' is a tremendously boring film! Especially the wraparound story prior to the first big bang is almost intolerable dull and overlong. A bunch of irritating twenty-something people gather in someone's Manhattan apartment for a goodbye party and it seems to go on forever. Nobody cares about their romantic issues and the more they open their mouths, the dumber they appear, anyway. Particularly Hud, the guy operating the camera through tick and thin, makes some of the dumbest remarks I've ever heard. The continuously shaky camera wasn't as bad as everyone said, and at several times it clearly noticeable that professional cinematographers are holding the device instead of one of the players. I understand that, since J.J Abrams pumped quite a lot of budget into fancy digital effects that had to be shown at least a bit properly. The eventual nature of the menace actually raises more questions than it provides answers and logic and its design is not the least bit impressive. Rudimentary the concept of 'Cloverfield' has a lot in common with the much better Korean monster-highlight 'The Host'; only the latter didn't cause motion sickness to any of its viewers of course. 'The Host' is just far superior. First and foremost the monster looks more original, the character drawings are more realistic and likable and the production doesn't purely thrive on pretension.",3,17,35,9 March 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Myths and fairytales is a seemly Hammer-horror world!
","(Small Spoilers) The abominable headless horseman and his horse are terrorizing a small village north of New York, near the end of the 18th century. Johnny Depp is a modern constable and his innovating techniques aren't welcome in New York. Therefore, he's sent over to the town to investigate the murders. The town is in fear and  even though Ichabod Crane tries to remain realistic  he soon faces finds out the legend it real. Yet, the cause of this reign of terror still is human hatred and diabolism and Crane slowly unwraps the intrigues and secrets the little town is filled with. The famous Horseman-legend is ideal material for gothic filmmaker Tim Burton. The screenplay that was offered him here gives him the perfect opportunity to drown the audience in a macabre surrounding, complete with fairy-tales elements such as witches who live in the woods and tree that start to bleed when cut. The portrayal of the ghoulish town reminds you of the typical Hammer Studio's way of working. A factor that isn't coincidental, since Burton himself is a big fan of these chilling gothic horror films. Burton's ingenious talent, along with the big budget results in truly magnificent scenery. The town looks ghoulish and the sequences in the dark woods are pretty haunting. Some nice special effects as well, even though the CGI is exaggerated at times. The story becomes extra compelling thanks to the good acting performances. We already knew that Johnny Depp did some of his best work while directed by Tim Burton (Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands) and the role of nervous, itchy constable suits him perfectly. Christina Ricci plays his female oppositewith blond hair for this occasion. She's a truly stunning beauty and a multi-talented actress, for sure. Ricci sounds amazingly sexy when she's saying lines like `Do you think me wicked?' Really good and worth mentioning as well are the guest appearances by Martin Landau (who portrayed an impressive Bela Lugosi in Burton's Ed Wood) and Hammer horror legend (Christopher Lee). Perhaps the best actor choice is Christopher Walken in his role of the Headless HorsemanHe doesn't say one word during the entire film, but his satanic charisma was never reflected better. Sleepy Hollow is great entertainment and one of the most professional horror movies of the nineties. Check it out in case you haven't yet!",8,2,4,22 April 2004
Silent Hill," Most overrated film of 2006
","Okay um, do you have to be a member of a secret video game-cult to comprehend the 'brilliance' of this film adaptation, or something? I sure as hell don't understand all the positive reactions and praising reviews on this movie, so maybe that's because a) I'm a stupid imbecile who missed the whole point or b) I never played the game or even heard of it before rumors got out that a movie was being produced based on it. I watched a very boring, pretentious, overlong, unnecessarily confusing and truly mundane ghost-story that, despite of the nifty direction job by Christophe Gans, felt like an utter waste of time. Granted, most of the locations and set pieces are genuinely sinister-looking and the grand finale, albeit realized with awful CGI-effects, is quite spectacular, but the story is just an incoherent bunch of nonsense that even the trashiest b-movie producers of the 1970's wouldn't dare turning into a movie! In order to unravel the strange behavior patterns of her adopted daughter Sharon, dedicated mum Rose Da Silva travels to the little girl's birth region to investigate what traumatizing events went on there. After dealing with the clichéd obstacles (like weird townsfolk advising her not to go etc...), Rose discovers the ominous village of Silent Hill, where ashes constantly snow down from the sky and computer generated beetles attack for no reason other than hospitality. Sharon vanishes after a banal car crash, but Rose teams up with female copper Cybil Bennett to conquer the horrors of Silent Hill. After this, I kind of lost all interest in Roger Avery's script, but it naturally has to do with diabolical cults, witch-covens and ancients curses. Can we say 'déjà-vu'? Everything in this film is incredibly mediocre, from Sean Bean's tiresome performance as the girl's father to the overly complex plot-twists that are clearly just there for padding reasons. Many people  myself included  complained about recent video game based horror films like 'House of the Dead' or 'Alone in the Dark' for being far too hectic and ridiculously over-the-top in the gore department, but 'Silent Hill' is the complete opposite (dull and really lame) and that's definitely not good, either. Skipping this film would be my advise, but what the hell do I know about good video games?",3,5,12,9 December 2006
The Hateful Eight," There won't be many coming home
","Now, yours truly is and probably forever will remain a devoted Quentin Tarantino fan-boy. I'm a huge admirer of everything this man has done so far and I also honestly think that he's one of the very few filmmakers out there who has developed his very own, unique and inimitable style. Even if it wouldn't be hyped and anticipated months from beforehand all over the internet, you'd still be able to recognize QT's newest movie straight away. Why? Because there simply isn't another director who writes dialogues like he does. There isn't a single other director who provides a soundtrack so suitable for his/her films. There aren't any other directors that find the exact right balance between visual style, atmosphere, dialogues, humor and excessive violence. There are very few directors that somehow bring out the best possible performances from their entire ensemble casts, etc.Still, it sometimes seems as if Tarantino's formerly worshiped trademarks are now turning against him. I have the impression that I read more and more hate-reviews every time he releases a new film, and all things that people used to love unanimously – like the dialogues – now seem to upset and irritate them. It's not because I'm a big QT fan that I'm not skeptical and, yes, admittedly even I would have preferred that 'The Hateful Eight' was less talkative and at least 30-45 minutes shorter in running time. The film is great in terms of atmosphere, setting, character development and camera-work, but nearly two and a half hour of (primarily irrelevant) drivel and balderdash before anything exciting happens is a little bit too exaggerated; even for a master like Tarantino. And another point of criticism, personally I really missed the all-overpowering 'WOW'-sentiment, and that actually already was the case in 'Django Unchained' as well. All of Tarantino's older movies, up until 'Inglorious Bastards', were also astounding in terms of originality and imaginative plotting. 'The Hateful Eight' is basically a very simplistic tale, a sort of whodunit in a stone-cold and unpleasant western environment. In spite of all of Sam Jackson's long monologues and Tim Roth's brilliant Hangman speech, the essence of the plot lies within the question 'who poisoned the coffee?' 'The Hateful Eight' contains almost too many highlights to list, and that's the most important conclusion of my viewing. The long and moody opening sequence, slowly turning around the deformed Christ statue, is pure art! In fact, the cinematography throughout the entire film is brilliant and chock-full of ingenious angles; outside in the excruciatingly cold Wyoming winter as well inside in the haberdashery. I think I covered the greatness of the dialogues already, and the violence featuring in the last half hour is also stupendous, with heads getting blown clean off and scumbags puking out all the blood in their bodies. In another interview I read that Tarantino listed two movies as his main inspiration, namely his own 'Reservoir Dogs' and John Carpenter's 'The Thing'. Those two are indeed well represented, but I would definitely add one other title, and I'm sure QT knows I'm right, and that's the obscure but raw and excessively violent Spanish/Italian western 'Cut-Throats Nine'. The original soundtrack by Ennio Morricone sent cold shivers down my spine, but there's another song on the soundtrack that even made me happier. All my life I've been a fan of Roy Orbison, but thanks to Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight' I discovered a magnificent song of his that I never heard before. 'I won't be many coming home' is a fantastic song and ideally fits the tone and content of the film.",7,0,3,22 January 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A must see !!! ***** out of ****
","Who else than Stanley Kubrick could take a serious subject like the cold war and tell the story like a comedy ??? He proves his genius in this film more like in any other film of his. It's the story about one general ( with the very appropriate name Jack D. Ripper) gone mad and he launches an attack on Russia all by himself. He's mad, but still smart enough to prevent that anyone can stop him. He's got this strange ( but very funny ) theories about body-fluids, but his men respect him and do everything he says. So 34 fully-armed plains are sent to as many targets. Meanwhile his Colonel, Mandrake, tries to talk sense to him and the president and another General are trying to warn the Russian prime minister. You can have nothing but great respect for Peter Sellers. He plays three roles in this film and every single one of them is flawless. The doctor Strangelove character is hilarious and creepy at the same time. His appearances as the doctor are, along with the telephone conversations between the president and the Russian Prime minister the funniest moments in the film... Also the classic bomb-ride of Major Kong off course. George C. Scott is clearly having fun in his role and the debut of James Earl Jones is also definitely worth mentioning. Like I said already...a must see film if you're a film lover in general.",10,117,215,5 June 2003
Scary Movie 2," A very poor and lackluster effort.
","The unexpected success of 'Scary Movie' demanded an immediate sequel and all the Wayans' brothers could come up with was this uninspired, irritating story that (attempts to) spoof Haunted House horror films such as the 'House on Haunted Hill', 'Poltergeist' and 'the Haunting'. Part two was released only a good 10 months after the original and this clearly resulted in a hack job that never should have come out. Apart from a bearable intro, in which a deranged James Woods performs a wacky exorcism, 'Scary Movie 2' is nothing but a dreadful series of unfunny jokes, exaggerated graphics and gags that show no insight in the wonderful genre of horror. The complete cast returns and a few fresh ones are introduced (like the sexy Kathleen Robertson and the tasteless Tori Spelling) for spending a couple of nights in an ancient mansion where spirits dwell, cats become kick-boxers and the indoor plants smoke pot. Tim Curry, once the star of cult-classics, lowers himself to playing the horny college professor. This film is vulgar, tasteless and very offensiveyet, I couldn't care less about that! It's not funny and that's pretty bad for a supposedly hilarious parody/comedy. Avoid in case you've got some brain capacity left!",3,9,20,16 January 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," One of a Kind Fantasy film. Definitely Del Toro's greatest film!
","Even though I'm one of the absolute few horror freaks out there who thinks the films of Guillermo Del Toro are vastly overrated (or at least over-hyped), deep down I was somewhat confident that 'Pan's Labyrinth' would rapidly become his ultimate masterwork. All of his previous genre efforts contain ingenious fantasy elements and genuinely macabre undertones (especially 'Cronos' and 'The Devil's Backbone') but the screenplays always were unexciting - on the verge of dull, even - and eventually only depended on Del Toro's directorial style & craftsmanship. The aforementioned titles, and to a certain degree 'Blade II' and 'Mimic' as well, are enchanting to look at but the stories ultimately failed to impress me. A simple glimpse at the poster art and synopsis of 'Pan's Labyrinth' already indicated it would be a world of difference! It seems as if Del Toro single-handedly revives the formula of legitimate fairy-tales and passionately reverts to all its old-fashioned and uncanny characteristics, like ominous & grotesque landscapes, youthful heroines, monsters and fairies, violence and very disturbing scenery. Tim Burton is another very gifted filmmaker in the field of adult fairy-tales, but even his films eventually tend to get sentimental and overly joyful, whereas 'Pan's Labyrinth' admirably sustains a dark and harrowing atmosphere throughout. And it becomes even more praiseworthy, because Del Toro also managed to successfully blend the fantasy-atmosphere with actual black pages in our history books; more particularly the fascist political situation in Spain near the end of WWII. The film opens with an introduction of a young princess who lost her immortality because she got curious and left her father's magical kingdom in order to explore the rest of the world. Her spirit still floats around though, eagerly looking out to get into the body of a young girl who's courageous and strong enough to fulfill three ordeals that'll bring her back to her father. The fantastic dreamy tone of the intro brutally gets interrupted with images of a young girl and her pregnant mother traveling to the domain of her stepfather, who's an incredibly relentless, sadistic and power-mad army captain under the reign of Franco. Whilst Ofelia enters the garden's labyrinth, where Pan the guardian informs here about her birthright, rebels and insiders fruitlessly attempt to bring down the Captain's dictatorship. Even though 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a constantly eventful motion picture, it has to be said the opening 45 minutes (after the intro) are rather dull and disappointing. Ofelia's initial meetings with Pan as well as her first task to accomplish aren't convincing and lack the dark atmosphere the brief fairy-tale introduction promised us. Only after Ofelia's second ordeal  a brief but wondrous confrontation with a malevolent creature with eyes in the palms of his hands  and a baffling depiction of the Captain's evil persona (that man is totally emotion- and heartless!), the film becomes indescribably compelling and hauntingly unsettling. And particularly the climax, which features some unexpected and rarely-seen-before twists, is a powerful demonstration of versatile cinema. The cinematography, set pieces and wholesome of effects all look stunningly breathtaking and nobody can every claim the Oscars 'Pan's Labyrinth' won in these categories are undeserved. It's a magnificent film to look at AND listen to as well, as the music (courtesy of Javier Navarette) is extremely enchanting. Watch it when you have the opportunity!",8,4,9,6 April 2007
Final Destination 2," Exactly the same...only a little grosser
","Final Destination 1 was one of the only films ever which basic plot-idea made me feel uncomfortable. Not that the film was so mesmerizing or outstanding but simply the idea of a higher force (= death) following you around because your time has come made me somewhat worried. The inevitable sequel to this unexpected little horror-hit has little ambition and practically re-tells the exact same story with different characters (duh!) and even filthier gore. This time, it's a girl (named after horror maestro Roger Corman) who receives a portentous premonition about a horrible road-accident and so saves the life of a group of people that were waiting at the traffic lights. Of course Mr. Grim Reaper isn't about to let them off this easily and the all start dying in ludicrously exaggerated ways (death by flying fence!!). The idiotic theories and added sub-plots are desperate attempts to make the wholesome look at least a little different than the first while the presence of Ali Larter (survivor of the original) is entirely unnecessary. I could also bring up that this film is offensive and contemptuous for portraying death as a simple special effect but I'm not going there because I don't want to give the impression that I totally disliked this film. The shock effects and visuals are astonishing and especially the initial car accident is horrific and very unsettling. The film is completely tensionless and it amazes me how cold and careless everyone's reactions are when yet another person horribly died right in front of their eyes. I can be brief about the acting performances since movies like this simply don't require skilled sense of dialogue. They all do their best, I guess, but it remains Tony 'Candyman' Todd who steals the show with his 2 minutes guest appearance. Final Destination 2 is worthy horror viewing as long as you're not in a too demanding mood. Maybe the best way to look at it is picturing it as a morbid version of America's Funniest Home Videos.",5,0,3,30 January 2005
Blade II," Don't Fear The Reaper(s)
","Part two unquestionably is the best entry in the rather dreadful 'Blade' series, simply because the director's chair was occupied by a gifted filmmaker for a change. Guillermo Del Toro might be a little overrated ('Cronos' and 'The Devil's Backbone' really aren't that good...), from a routine and dull vampire movie script, he can make a remotely entertaining and visually impressive time-waster. With Del Toro in charge, it quickly becomes obvious how badly the first 'Blade' and 'Blade 3: Trinity' lacked a decent director. The story is also slightly better than in the original Blade, with our half man  half vampire hero teaming up with his enemies to battle an entirely new breed of bloodsucking species; the Reapers. These pale and caped monsters are seemly immune to garlic and other old anti-vampire tricks and  very interesting  they drink the blood of vampire victims as well as humans. There's still way too much hi-tech nonsense going on in this film and the fights between Blade and his vampire opponents now look like lame imitations of 'The Matrix', but at least there's some relatively good humor in the script and Wesley Snipes is kept on a short leash by Del Toro. Kris Kristofferson reprises his role of cool old mentor but the best part is reserved for Guillermo Del Toro's buddy Ron Perlman. He's the leader of 'The Blood Pact'; a squadron of eccentric vampires that are trained to kill Blade. Perlman is the real star of this movie with his impressive charisma and barbaric looks.",5,1,12,22 January 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," How would you like your throat cut, sir?
","The films of Tim Burton are always a gift from the heavens (the mediocre 'Planet of the Apes' being the one notable exception), especially for horror fanatics, since they always strike a happy medium between mainstream production values and availability and yet always revolve on sinister topics. And if there ever was one story that literally begs to receive the typical Burton-treatment, it has got to be 'Sweeney Todd'. The gloomy Victorian setting, the continuous moody atmosphere, the depressing decors, the mentally tormented main characters and the unhinged depiction of shocking murders Â… all these aspects simply have Burton's name written all over them. Sure it's a musical, and this generally isn't considered to be die-hard horror fanatics' favorite genre, but even the smallest detail featuring in 'Sweeney Todd' makes it damn clear the movie is primarily a genuine horror effort, and even one that is more revolting and macabre than most. Benjamin Barker once lived a life of true happiness. He was married to a beautiful woman with whom he had a cherubic baby girl and he was the most promising young barber in the whole of London. But then the malicious eminent Judge Tulpin spotted his wife and promptly ruined his whole existence. Barker got exiled and Tulpin literally claimed ownership of both his wife and daughter. Now, 15 long years later, Barker returns as a thoroughly embittered person going by the name Sweeney Todd and with only vengeance on his mind, particularly when he learns that his beloved wife poisoned herself and his daughter still lives imprisoned in Tulpin's house. Sweeney forms a diabolical alliance with the eccentric Mrs. Lovett. He cuts the throats of unsuspecting clients and she processes the bodies into meat pies unique in the whole of London. Naturally his rising stardom fetches the attention of Judge Tulpin and soon Sweeney Todd will be able to extract his long-anticipated blood vengeance, but in the meantime a whole lot of new complications arise. 'Sweeney Todd' is a truly masterful accomplishment and I don't mind admitting I stared at the screen with my eyes, ears and mouth wide open throughout the entire playtime. I'm usually not a big fan of constant singing myself, but it never once bothered me here because the lyrics of the songs are as grim & disturbing as the plot itself and, moreover, the film is just breath taking to look at. I just found out 'Sweeney Todd' won the Oscar for best art direction. This has got one of the best well-deserved awards ever handed out during this ceremony, as Burton's movie is almost like a Gothic nightmare coming to life on the big screen. The London streets and alleys never looked so ominous, the people never looked so uncanny and the political corruptness rarely appeared so convincing. Admittedly it takes a while before the blood starts flooding from random throats, but until then there's always the nightmarish atmosphere to keep you thrilled and, besides, the gore-soaked second half widely compensates for everything. The way those bodies came crashing down hard in Mrs.Lovett's cellar after having their throats slit wide open from ear to ear.... that's a real horror film, singing or no singing! The acting performances are flawless and perplexing, even though nobody really expected them to be. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are regular Tim Burton choices, but not at all obvious musical stars, even in spite of their semi-musical roles in 'Corpse Bride'. But still they both leave a big impression and also the (even less obvious) supportive players deliver stellar performances as well. A masterpiece.",9,3,7,25 February 2008
Shutter Island," Island of high expectations but slightly lobotomized results
","Perhaps I should better begin this user comment by underlining that I'm primarily a horror fanatic and, moreover, that I have a specific exaltation for genre movies taking place on (A) remote inescapable islands and largely set in (B) mental asylums. I've seen numerous cheap horror movies, ranging from astounding to abominable, featuring one or both of these keywords and I personally think they are fundamental components to help determine the creepiness impact of a certain horror movie. 'Shutter Island' features both these key ingredients as well, so normally this should have been one of my most anticipated movies ever, but instead I was quite skeptical ever since I first saw the trailer. First and foremost I'm annoyed again that everybody seems to avoid labeling this as a horror movie. Like it's still common to think horror is in an inferior genre that acclaimed directors and actors don't even lay their hands on. If you look on the main page on this website, 'Shutter Island' is categorized as drama, mystery and thriller. I assure you, given the subject matter and the scenery featuring here, this is a horror film. It has everything to do with atmosphere and nothing with bloodshed or ax-wielding maniacs. Secondly, I tend to be very tolerant and easygoing on those aforementioned cheap horror movies because they're often low-budgeted and struggling movies from aspiring and hard- working directors. However, in the case of 'Shutter Island', where the budget is practically unlimited and all the involved people are highly respected and critically acclaimed names, I feel I'm entitled to be extra demanding. I expect everything to be impeccably perfect, including the plot, the atmosphere, the set pieces, the acting performances, the directing, the continuity and the tension level. The greatest news to announce is that 'Shutter Island' lives up to most of these expectations, especially when it comes to atmosphere and choice of locations. Right from the opening seconds already, you can tell this will become a thoroughly ominous and gripping film with a professional eye for detail. A ferryboat appears from a thick cloud of fog, there are clear signs of an approaching hurricane, there is recitation about an 'asylum for the criminally insane' and the first long images of the titular island are brought under the guidance of excruciatingly sinister musical tones. The intensity of the opening sequence promptly grabs you by the throat and you want the two main characters – Federal U.S. Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule – to get away from the island as far as possible before they even set foot on it. 'Shutter Island' first unfolds as a compelling mystery set in the paranoid and depressing post- WWII era of the early 1950's. The island is a controversial governmental place where the Doctors Crawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max Von Sydow) are running a mental institute facility for 'normal' male and female cases as well as incurably dangerous patients. The Marshals are called to the island to investigate the inexplicable disappearance of a female patient, but there's obviously a lot more brooding underneath the surface. The doctors and wardens deliberately boycott the Marshals' investigation and Teddy Daniels has a personal and much more critical agenda to fulfill. He's looking for the pyromaniac patient responsible for the death of his wife and he intends to expose the island as a place where the American government uses mental convalescents as subjects to experiment upon. Teddy also suffers from painful War traumas, like the sights of frozen cadavers in a German concentration camp, and he still has conversations with his deceased wife Dolores. When the hurricane vanquishes the island, Teddy and Chuck see an opportunity to sneak into the infamous C-Block, where they lock away the worst cases and presumably the experiments, but the revelations where Teddy stumbles upon as from that moment are certainly not what he expected or hoped to find out. 'Shutter Island' is the type of film that overwhelms and deeply impresses you with plot twists, subliminal themes, red herrings, convoluted conspiracy theories, character drawings growing increasingly complex and intriguing but ultimately irrelevant sub plots. The script feels like a solidly structured and tightly woven wholesome for as long as you're watching the film, but it's definitely worthwhile to analyze the movie afterwards. Unfortunately I can't elaborate too much without revealing some essential plot elements, but I urge you do it yourself. Once you leave the cinema or take the disc out of the DVD player, starting thinking back about the little things that were done or said throughout the entire film. Movies like this deserve to be discussed and analyzed rather than to just walk away with a feeling of overall astonishment. You'll notice that some minor details fit in perfectly with the denouements revealed at the end, whereas other story aspects will suddenly become illogical, senseless and implausible. And also, if you've seen a lot of grim, obscure and long-forgotten horror movies (the kind I talked about in the first paragraph), well than you honestly won't be surprised at what you see that often. You won't hear me claim that 'Shutter Island' is unoriginal or predictable, but like so frequently the case, it does incorporate many little facets (whether just a certain noise, bizarre characteristic or tiny plot detail) that I spotted already in other movies. That really isn't a complaint; merely a footnote. I don't intend to say that 'Shutter Island' ripped any other films, simply that horror fanatics are likely to be slightly less impressed than the more mainstream audience. My only main complaint is that I personally found 'Shutter Island too long. Admittedly I have a bit of an aversion towards long films, but I really felt that some of the sub plots and repetitive hallucination sequences could have been cut shorter. The filming locations, set- pieces and scenery are tremendous and particularly the re-creation of the 50's atmosphere is admirably accurate.",7,6,13,6 March 2010
Over the Top," Arm wrestling? Who cares about arm wrestling?!?
","As a fan of insanely grotesque 80s action vehicles starring Sylvester Stallone, I was genuinely astounded upon discovering there still existed a Sly-movie I never heard about! Not that it's a big loss, evidently, since even Stallone himself is somewhat embarrassed whenever 'Over the Top' is brought up. With good reason, I'd say, because this is seriously one of the dumbest films ever made. It's dumb because the main theme is the world championship of arm wrestling, but it's even dumber because it literally features all dreadful clichés, irritating 80s pop-songs and sentimentally sickening dialogues you can imagine! Whereas he was blasting away evil villains with heavy artillery in 'Rambo III' and 'Cobra', Sly Stallone is training his biceps in his mobile gym-truck and desperately trying to reconnect with his estranged 12-year-old son here in 'Over the Top'. There's never any proper explanation of why Lincoln Hawk abandoned his wife and son ('I had my reasons' is not really an answer), but now that his mother is terminally ill, he randomly goes to pick up Junior at his Military Academy graduation party. The tyrannical grandfather (Robert Loggia) still wants Hawk out of their lives, but the awfully acting boy is slowly developing a love-bond. Aww. Everything builds up towards a biceps-bursting finale in Las Vegas, which is the only somewhat remotely form of action you'll find in this dire effort. If you're in an undemanding or brainless mood, you can perhaps still enjoy all the aspects that are unintentionally hilarious; - like picturing Mr. Rambo as a caring father, the facial expressions of the battling arm wrestlers or the sight of Loggia who doesn't have a clue why he agreed to star.",3,1,5,25 July 2019
The Grapes of Wrath," The most important word you'll ever hear : Family !!!
","Wow...this movie is just WOW !! I've been wanting to see it for such a long time but I never got the chance. Now, I finally did and it even goes beyond my highest expectations... I was prepared to see some class-A drama but everything what this family goes through is even worse than I thought. This famous movie milestone goes about the Joad family. They have to leave everything they own in Oklahoma behind. Them and several other poor families are attracted by California because there is supposed to be work and a place to live. The long trip is filled with misery and when they finally get in California, it seems that they've been deceived once more. There's almost no food and 8 hungry mouths to fill. It's impossible not to get touched by the Joad family. All the characters are so sad but at the same time so brave. They don't give up and keep fighting...you just have to encourage them while watching this film. The Grapes of Wrath really makes you feel happy you live in this era and in this part of the world. You know stories like this really happened in the old days and they still do in some parts of the world. This kind of film is excellent to make you realize you have nothing to complain about.The dramatic highlights in this motion picture are countless : The flashbacks about how families are driven away from their homes, the grandfather's 'funeral' , the mother and son conversation near the end... All these scenes and several other ones are indicators of great drama and brilliant cinema. The Grapes of Wrath received several prices and nominations and it deserved every single one of them. Every element in  it is flawless. Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad is one of the most intriguing characters ever shown of the screen. He's absolutely brilliant.
The highest possible recommendation isn't yet high enough to describe The Grapes of Wrath...If you ever have the chance: SEE IT !",8,16,27,6 October 2003
Corpse Bride," The most enchanting film of 2005!
","No matter how pretty 'Finding Nemo' looked, regardless how original the modeling clay of 'Chicken Run' was or no matter how overwhelming 'Final Fantasy' felt...the absolute best animation films come from the mind of cinema-genius Tim Burton. His new masterwork 'Corpse Bride', as well as his older classic 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', uses the delicate stop-motion technique, by which handicraft puppets are carefully moved by the millimeter. This modus operandi is quite time-consuming and fragile, but the result looks utterly beautiful and 'Corpse Bride' is a lot more elegant and enchanting than the most advanced computer animation movie! Aside from being visually impressive, Tim Burton's newest film is also extremely funny, well-scripted and very swinging! The story is set in typical Burton-world with grim forests, morbid characters and  of course  politically incorrect jokes about death and decomposition. Whilst rehearsing his wedding vows in the nearby forest, the timid Victor van Dort accidentally resurrects (and weds!!) the corpse bride who has been waiting on that same spot since she was brutally murdered on her own wedding night. Despite the fact that he feels sorry for her and wishes to help, Victor urgently needs to get back to the living before his arranged bride is given to another man. The subject matter all seems very depressing and tragic but  knowing Burton's style  it's an often cheerful and energetic film. Instead of portraying the world of the deceased as a sad place, it's a colorful party palace where skeletons and rotting corpses drink and sing all night long. Heck, their world is a lot more fun than the world of the living and you almost feel sorry for the living because their existence is so black & white. The voices for all the terrific characters are splendidly cast. Tim Burton regulars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter do great and our director honors horror veterans Christopher Lee and Michael Gough with outstanding guest appearances. Danny Elfman's music is flawless as always and the marvelous end-sequence is the most touching moment in animation cinema ever. My only regret was that this movie is way too short  only 75 minutes  and I wished it went on forever.",9,2,5,14 November 2005
Top Secret!," ZAZ Blitzkrieg-humor
","In between their most successful films  Airplane, Naked Gun and Hot Shots  the ZAZ team modestly spoofed the espionage and conspiracy theory thrillers in Top Secret! The film involves American teen idol Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer in his first big screen role) attending a culture festival in Nazified East Germany. The festival merely is a cover-up for the sinister and evil practices of the Nazis who kidnapped an eminent scientist. Nick quickly interferes in all this and ends up as member of a resistance-party, existing of French dudes with funny-sounding names and weird comical habits (like drinking gasoline) . Remaining loyal to the ZAZ trademarks, 'Top Secret!' is one giant running gag and a spitfire of chuckles in which absolutely NOTHING has to be taken seriously. The European-minded character of this film provided the writers with the occasion to make fun of the typical French, German and Swedish stereotypes and that forms a perfect contrast with the American surf-generation. As usual in this type of films, the widely elaborated jokes miss their target (sometimes they even are painfully unfunny) but the smaller background slapstick is hilarious and almost causes you a stomach pain from laughing. The open assaults to immensely successful cinema classics like 'the Great Escape', 'Wizard of Oz' or 'The Blue Lagoon' is something you either love or hate, but it perfectly reflects the type of over-the-top humor these writers want to bring. Val Kilmer does well in his first major role and his youthful charm helps increasing his teen-popstar credibility. Furthermore, there are a few delightful small roles for authentic cinema veterans such as Omar Shariff, Michael Gough and my personal favorite Peter Cushing. Top Secret isn't Abraham's and the Zucker brother's best work, but it's still great entertainment and the quality balances somewhere between 'The Kentucky Fried Movie' and 'Airplane'.",6,26,44,3 October 2004
American Pie," Shameless and lurid high school fun!
","American Pie (and the whole trend of high-school comedies it started) can be described best Farrelly bros. comedy for adolescents. A constant barrage of vulgarity and cheap sex-jokes without an actual story to tell. American Pie introduces four desperately horny young men who make a pact. Before their graduation, they have to lose their virginity no matter what! To obtain this goal they're willing to go through all possible forms of public humiliations and mockery. Throughout the whole film, it is exclusively the male teenager who's portrayed as a filthy-minded creature. The girls in American Pie are sensitive, intelligent and generally considered to be the superior species, which is a pretty fresh and satisfying point of view. The films contains a few sequences that are notorious alreadysuch as the `bakery-masturbation'-scene and  oh yes  the magnificent striptease by the gorgeous Shannon Elizabeth
American Pie is lamebrain entertainment in its purest form. The acting is overall good, with some new fresh faces as well as some veteran actors (Eugene Levy steals the show as Jim's dad). The jokes work, the screenplay contains some fun, memorable quotes (`It's not a space shuttle launch, it's SEX') and the creators DO know their classics! Just look at the terrific reference to `The Graduate' near the end of the film. You can easily skip both sequels thoughmore from the same, only worse. American Pie became a huge success and one of the biggest box office hits of the late nineties; while modest, intelligent little films from that same period are being catapulted straight into Oblivion. Cinema may not always be fair, but American Pie sure is fun!",5,1,3,15 April 2004
28 Weeks Later," No heroes ... Only agony.
","Unlike most of the people with whom I discuss horror movies, I wasn't too impressed with this movies predecessor, the acclaimed '28 Days Later' directed by Danny Boyle. It was an intense and hugely atmospheric genre-reviver, but definitely not the horror masterpiece many fans claimed it to be. These same people were equally enthusiast and wild raving about the sequel '28 Weeks Later' and, despite my initial skepticism, I wholeheartedly have to agree this time! Though still not perfect and inevitably suffering from the same shortcomings as the original, Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's movie is a superior achievement in every department and easily one of the most disturbing and effectively petrifying stories that got unleashed upon cinema audiences throughout the past few decades. The atmosphere in '28 Weeks Later' is continuously grisly and ominous, the on screen carnage is relentless and sickening, the London settings (or what remains of them) are depressing and the frequently repeated theme song 'In a House, in a Heartbeat' immensely contributes to the overall ambiance of pure damnation & hopelessness. '28 Weeks Later' represents pure and genuine terror, but unfortunately that definition also covers some implausible situations and plot twists.The story is rudimentary simple but a logical follow-up to the events of the first film. In the aftermath of the disastrous epidemic that exterminated nearly the entire British population, US army forces have taken control of the London area and slowly begin to repopulate the save regions with survivors. Among them is Donald Harris (Robert Carlyle in another mesmerizing performance), who was forced to abandon his wife Alice following an attack by infected people in the countryside. His children return from abroad as well and promptly escape from the quarantined zone to recover souvenirs of their mother from the parental house. This series of events causes the second outbreak of the feared virus but also raises hope to develop a vaccine, as the Harris' kids apparently are immune to the effects of the infection. I honestly admired how this film, even more than the original, doesn't feature any heroic characters or daredevils. All the characters are real and identifiable people, living in dreadful fear and responding to dangerous ordeals reasonably. Even the few rational Americans that disobey orders to rescue the Harris' children remain vulnerable and just as mortal as the people running from the gunfire.Admittedly, you sometimes deliberately have to ignore some major plot holes and downright impossible story elements. It's highly unusual, for example, that the children could (or even wanted to) leave the safety zone unauthorized and explore the wastelands, especially for something as banal as a photograph. Also, I understand Donald's job as a caretaker in the safety zone granted him access to most of the buildings there, but does that really include the secluded military laboratories and top secret evidence rooms? The hardest aspect to acknowledge is the unexplained behavior of Carlyle's character once he turned into one of the infected. He alone seems to have developed a quite impressive portion of intellect, orientation and reasoning skills suddenly, because he slyly escapes the military's drastic extermination measures and successfully follows the trail of his fleeing offspring through the destroyed city. All these, and a couple more, are obvious errors in the script that threaten to bring down the impression that '28 Weeks Later' had on you, but the good news is that they won't necessarily bother you during the actual viewing; only afterwards. During the film itself, particularly when you watch it on a big cinema screen, you're most likely to be overwhelmed by the virulent action, large-scaled annihilation attacks and nauseating massacres. Perhaps another slight demerit involves the chaotic digital camera-work. Again, just as in its predecessor, the wild attacks of the infected are too often unclear and overly hectic and some of the pivot sequences are difficult to follow. The editing is roughly handled at times, but it fits the overall barbaric tone on the film. '28 Weeks Later' was one of the first movies in a long time that actually managed to scare and disturb me. Numerous sequences are extremely powerful and irreversibly burnt in my memory as genuinely unsettling, like the bombing footage, the night vision perspective in the London underground and Robert Carlyle chased by dozens of ravenous ex-people during the intro. Fresnadillo's directing is magnificent and surefooted, which is quite an accomplishment as well, considering it's only his second long-feature movie; following 'Intacto' in 2001.",8,16,30,7 October 2007
The Thing," On the South Pole ... no one can hear you scream neither
","It was about time I watched this movie again. I was 12 when I first saw it and it scared the living hell out of me. Ever since then I'm careful when I see a Hushky...John Carpenter's version of the 'Who Goes There' story is fascinating, scary and pretty gore at several times but it surely is highly recommended. The creepy atmosphere is unique and very few movies equal to it or even come close. The Thing is some sort of Alien monster that has been safely frozen for the last 100.000 years but now it has thawed. That's the fault of a few Norwegian guys...In the form of a innocent looking dog, the thing ends up in an American Station. This is the greatest power of the enemy. It's fully capable to take over any life form and therefore it's hard to detect. And ... even more importantly ... it doesn't take long before anyone can be trusted. Everyone could in fact be 'The Thing' This rather simple - but at the same time original and innovative - aspect about the enemy allows the story to create a unique claustrophobic atmosphere. First of all, you have the isolated landscape of the Antarctic Circle. The groups ' space to run and hide is very limited since it's unbearably cold and there are lots of storms. Secondly, the Thing to itself is very unpredictable. The tension between the characters can almost be smelled by the viewer and I think that's Carpenter biggest achievement about this movie. Although, there ain't much dialog in this film , you're kept close to the screen in order not to miss anything. Basically, Carpenter does pretty much the same as in his other horror classic Halloween. Although this is a complete different plot and complete different setting, there's not a message to detect, no psychological undertone or no form of humanity what so ever. Just a raw battle to survive between a bunch of tough men.And last but certainly not least ... some credit for the special effects and make-up department. This crew is just brilliant and pretty explicit for the 80's if you ask me. They managed to visualize a perfectly scary looking creature. Several shocking scenes will haunt your head long after you've seen this movie. Don't matter if you're a hardened horror fan already or not, but the images of a splitting dog and a human head marching on spider legs won't leave you senseless. Excellent Class A horror. Also worth a mention: the subtle but memorable score by Ennio Morricone... Highly recommend to all film-fans, a must see for horror freaks. The original version from 1951 is highly recommended as well. Lovely 50's SciFi-movie, that is !!Favorite 'rewind'-scene : The Doctor desperately tries to save a crew-member and prepares himself to give him a heart-massage. At the moment that his hands touch the guy's chest, it splits open and grabs the doctor with filthy looking teeth ...Enjoy !!",7,5,15,28 October 2003
The Village," The Village is nothing but humbug! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise
","NO spoilers don't worry; I won't ruin the precious (!) story I surely am going to be criticized for this again, but at least I hope to reach some people M. Night Shyamalan is nothing but a phony storyteller! At first I just thought he was over-hyped and untalented but the more films he delivers, the more it becomes clear that he's actually laughing with his fans and audiences for keeping up with his lame so-called 'mystery' tales. It wasn't my intention to watch Shyamalan's latest so quick after its releaseIn fact, after struggling my way through that dreadfully irritating 'Signs' I took an oath never to waste time or money anymore on his films. Luckily for me, a friend wasted his money on this because, I assure you, 'The Village' is absolutely worthless humbug. Shyamalan once made a partly successful film called 'The Sixth Sense' using some stylish elements. Since then, he shamelessly repeats this formula and all you'll ever find in his films are an exaggerated use of ominous music and silence, a very slow tempo and a cast that is overacting in the opposite way (meaning they do their best to look depressed, unworldly and silent). Would somebody please tell the director that atmospheric aspects like these only work when you've got a story to tell? The premise of a little village inhabited by social outcasts who're terrified of the creatures living in the nearby forests is dull, ultra-thin and definitely not suited for a compelling mystery tale. And then, of course, there's the famous 'twist-near-the-end' which pretty much has become Shyamalan's trademark. Well, the 'twist' is this film is so ridiculous, so predictable and so pathetic that the entire project instantly turns into a comedy! Actually, I wouldn't refer to it as a twist but as a confirmation that our precious director is completely uninspired and overrated. What amazes me the most is that so many respected actors are almost battling to become part of this fake hype. Surely Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt know better than to accept awful scripts like this? Hopefully naive fans won't start shouting that opponents of The Village didn't 'get it' and that the film actually contains several brilliant metaphors and underlying messages The only underlying message featuring here is that M. Night Shyamalan's constantly growing star-status is one giant hoax.",1,49,97,3 February 2005
Split," Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right ... Here I am, stuck in the middle with the 23 of you
","I completely gave up on M. Night Shyamalan between 2005 and 2015. Talking in film titles, that means between 'Lady in the Water' and 'The Visit'. I always thought his supposedly greatest accomplishments 'Unbreakable' and 'The Sixth Sense' were vastly overrated (and even blatant rip-offs of obscure horror gems), but at least they were watchable. I severely disliked 'Signs' and absolutely hated 'The Village', so after that it was exit M. Night for me. From what I read on the internet, he only made rubbish and commercial flops in this 10-year-period anyway. 'Split' seemed different. It has a more intriguing concept than all of Shyamalan's previous movies combined, and for the very first time, the plot genuinely appeals to fans of dark psycho-thrillers. Usually his stories are balancing on the verge of fantasy and melodrama, with a minor touch of morbidity.The first half of 'Split' is really good! The script luckily doesn't waste too much time and almost immediately begins with the powerful and intense kidnapping sequence of three teenage girls - in broad daylight on a busy parking lot - by a sinister young man with an evil grimace on his face. The girls, two typically shallow beauties and one introvert girl with a troubled past, are taken to an unknown location and locked up in a sort of basement. What follows next are a good 40-45 minutes of terrific cinema during which the three girls, simultaneously with the audience, gradually learn that their kidnapper isn't just an ordinary maniac but a deeply disturbed schizophrenic with no less than 23 different personalities. The quiet girl, Casey, realizes their only chance for escape is by manipulating the weaker personalities, but there's also a 24th and ultimately evil alter ego brooding within Kevin.Lots of praise and respect for talented young actress Anya Taylor-Joy, and especially for James McAvoy as Barry, Kevin, Dennis, Hedwig, Patricia, etc. Okay, admittedly, it must be a dream come true for any actor to be offered the chance to play a character like this and demonstrate that you are capable of depicting a variety of roles, but still McAvoy puts a lot of passion and devotion in every single twisted personality! My personal favorite is definitely the posh, elderly lady with the dress and necklace. Best male-actor-playing-ugly-old-woman since Robin Williams in 'Mrs. Doubtfire', for sure! Sadly, M. Night's true personality also comes to the surface, and not even McAvoy can prevent 'Split' from slowly turning into a dull and overly talkative B-thriller. Notably the conversations between whatever personality and his therapist are tedious and seem to last endlessly, but also Casey's cliched background story is quite redundant. Not sure what rating 'Split' received, but the violence and murders all occur off screen, and that is a damn shame! I didn't like the ending (come to think of it, I never like the endings in Shyamalan's movies) but apparently it's the bridge towards a sequel/origin story 'Glass'.",6,1,1,10 January 2020
The Hills Have Eyes," The Hills are Alive with the Sounds of ... SLAUGHTER!!
","I dislike the nowadays and boisterous remakes of classic horror movies as much as the next person but, ever since the news came that an update of 'The Hills Have Eyes' was in talks, I had great expectations towards it. There are reasons for this rather enthusiast anticipation, actually. Unlike 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' or 'The Fog', to name just two examples, Wes Craven's original 1977 screenplay was open for improvement AND Alexandre Aja would be just the right man for the job, as his own project 'Haute Tension' is definitely one of the best horror films since the year 2000. That particular film wasn't really a masterpiece of plotting, but it was genuinely grim and barbaric and those are exactly the qualities a film like 'The Hills Have Eyes' require as well. The new screenplay follows Craven's original fairly strict, except that the eyes in the hills aren't of members of an inbred family anymore but of an entire community of horribly mutated ghouls. Deep in the New Mexican deserts, a small village of coal miners once refused to leave the area at the time the American government decided to test nuclear weapons there, and now they still prowl the wasteland, assaulting travelers that dare to leave the main highways. The Carter family is next on the menu, and the mutants really don't care whether the victims are females, elderly folks or even newborn babies...Alexandre Aja delivers the exact right amount of disturbing tension and really a lot more gore than you could possibly dream of. Much more than the overrated Eli Roth, this young French filmmaker is the new prodigy of horror. Strictly talking in terms of cinema, 'The Hills Have Eyes' is also a more than decent production. The dialogs are fluently written and the characters are a lot more likable than in the original. By them I primarily refer to the members of the Carter family, as Michael Berryman's charisma as creepy Pluto remains unequaled. Altering the background of the desert-people into mutants was a pretty intelligent move by Aja, though. Despite being sadistic and utterly repulsive-looking bastards, these people are basically a sort of 'victims' themselves, which brings a lot of extra depth and unsubtle social criticism in the overall simplistic story. I'm sure this film also had its share of flaws, like the editing being a little too MTV-ish perhaps, but the thrills and fast pacing were just too overpowering to have me bother about them. Kudos also to the terrific selection of songs, the convincing cast of actors and actresses and  last but not least  the personal trainer of those brilliant German Shepard dogs!",9,105,171,18 March 2006
North by Northwest," Pure cinematic perfection It's as simple as that!
","I always do something special for anniversaries, and since this is the 3.400th user comment that I write for this wonderful website, I chose to review one of the greatest movies of all-time! Alfred Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest' is a timeless landmark, an impeccable classic and a pure cinematic monument! Only a handful of movies are totally perfect in every tiniest detail and remain just as astounding by today's standards as when they were first released upon audiences; - more than fifty years ago in this case. Straight from the marvelous and already unforgettable opening credits, designed by the brilliant Saul Bass and provided with mind-blowing music by Bernard Herrmann, you know that this will become a highlight even in the overall magnificent repertoire of Alfred Hitchcock. The genius screenplay, written by the same guy who scripted 'The Sound of Music' and 'West Side Story' of all people, is a kind of James Bond story avant-la-lettre. It's a nail-bitingly tense and at times extremely grotesque conspiracy/espionage thriller in which an innocent man's identity is mistaken for that of a government spy who actually doesn't exist. The sly and overconfident advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill is abducted from a hotel lobby and taken to a fancy countryside mansion where he's forced to admit that he is George Kaplan by the foreign spy Philippe Vandamm and his rude team. Thornhill narrowly escapes a carefully planned assassination attempt, but subsequently finds himself framed for murder and pursued by the police as well as by his assailants. He travels to Chicago by train, meets the staggeringly beautiful Eve Kendall and battles for his life all across America, until the final confrontation takes place on top of the Mount Rushmore monument. Now, it's already immensely difficult to bring a genuine edge-of- your-seat suspense thriller, but this film is simultaneously also comical! The humor in the screenplay of 'North by Northwest' is constant, subtle and dry. The dialogs between Cary Grant and Eve Saint Marie are a terrific example of this, but also the performances of Martin Landau (as the main villain's evil sidekick) and Jessie Royce Landis (as Grant's skeptical mother) are blackly humorous. The action sequences are phenomenal, with the legendary crop dusting airplane chase sequence as the absolute highlight, and the climax is unforgettable. 'North by Northwest' is just downright perfect; it's as simple as that.",10,2,5,29 October 2014
Hugo," Every reason why we love cinema
","features here in this bona fide masterpiece by the downright genius filmmaker Martin Scorsese! Usually I don't write user comments for popular high-budget blockbusters, but I specifically wanted to write about this movie because this is Scorsese's very own and personal ode to cinema and that urged me to write an ode to him and his work. Through using the most modern techniques and hypes – including 3D effects – Scorsese brings a deeply respectable homage to the pioneers and earliest basic techniques of the medium that loves so much and has been working for nearly half a century now. 'Hugo' is a magical fantasy/fairy-tale, filled with absorbing characters, earnest emotional story lines, dream- like decors and hi-tech special effects that actually emphasize the plot details rather than diverting your attention from the plot holes. The titular character is a shy and introvert young orphan who lives inside the walls of a Paris' train station in the late 1920's. Hugo makes sure that the station clocks keeps running on time without being noticed by the strict station inspector, and at night he desperately tries to repair a broken automaton. The device is the only thing that still connects Hugo with his deceased father and the young boy strongly believes that it carries a hidden message. And is he ever right! When Hugo and his new friend Isabelle discover the automaton's hidden message, they embark on an adventure that will uncover some secrets on people that are very close and dear to them. I don't want to reveal too much, but cinema connoisseurs can more or less predict what the adventure's about based on Ben Kingsley's character name and the Paris setting. The acting performances are stupendous, from the young and clearly over-talented child actors to the ageing but still vastly honorable veterans in the supportive cast, like Richard Griffiths and of course the almighty Christopher Lee. The 3D effects are never bothersome or overly exploited, like so often the case in these movies, and pretty much every piece of scenery and technical aspect is a joy to behold. Everything is perfect to the tiniest detail. The entire finale and the sub plots happening inside the trains station hall are, albeit clichéd and rather predictable, genuinely heartwarming and moving. We had to wait until the end of 2011 to see the best film of the whole year, but it was definitely worth it. Martin Scorsese, I sincerely hope you win an Oscar for directing this movie  It'll even be more deserved than winning for 'The Departed'.",9,3,7,26 December 2011
The Orphanage," Admirable atmosphere & setting.
","I pretty much knew with relative certainty and from beforehand that 'The Orphanage' wasn't going to be my cup of tea. Slow-brooding ghost stories almost never appeal to me and I didn't even care for producer Guillermo Del Toro's own and critically acclaimed 'The Devil's Backbone'. But, considering the hugely positive internet buzz as well as the endless amount of praising reviews on this website, I  being a devoted horror fanatic  simply couldn't afford to ignore this Spanish instant classic entirely. Well, the only thing I can conclude after seeing the film is that 'The Orphanage' is exactly what you expect from a relatively soft, mainstream and overall ethically correct modern day horror production; whether it's made in Spain, Japan or elsewhere in the world. Obviously it's an extremely professionally made film, with a handful of memorable style elements and effective jump moments, but in the end it really isn't much more than just another derivative and predictable 'ghosts from the past coming back to haunt us' tale that lack the courage to go very far. Undoubtedly the qualitatively greatest aspect about 'The Orphanage' is the naturally sinister setting. The events take place in an old and remote orphanage  duh  located near a quiet beach with an inactive lighthouse and a wide network of sinister caves. Laura, who spend her childhood here, returns with her husband and 7-year-old son and intends to re-open the orphanage specifically for orphans with a mental and/or physical handicap. On the day of the opening, however, Laura's own son Simon  who's also adopted and chronically ill  mysteriously disappears without a trace. Months go by without a sign of life and Laura understandably starts to get desperate. Was Simon kidnapped by the uncanny lady who arrived at the orphanage and posed as a social assistant shortly before his disappearance? Or perhaps Laura should have listened more to her son's stories about the invisible friends he made, as they seem to know an awful lot of accurate details about the orphanage's dark past. Somewhat to my anticipated frustration, 'The Orphanage' contains all the clichés and stereotypes the sub genre of ghost stories has to offer. There's the overly fanatic mother versus the rational father, the eccentric and somewhat flamboyant spiritual medium, the morbid old lady that may or may not be real and of course a wide collection of pity-evoking long dead children whose souls are restless. The young and relatively inexperienced director J.A. Bayona does an impressive job maintaining the macabre ambiance all the way from start to finish, but sadly it isn't enough to qualify as a masterpiece in the genre. There's only just ONE that really made me jump towards the edge for my seat for a little while, namely the second confrontation with the elderly lady in the middle of a busy street. Although this is unquestionably a truly masterful sequence, it's nearly not enough as far as I'm concerned. Many fans glorify the finale, but the whole third act actually just confirmed to me that 'The Orphanage' rather wanted to be a sentimental melodrama about the true values of family and motherly love. When it comes to (Spanish) ghost stories of the past 10 to 20 years, Amenábar's unique and already classic 'The Others' is still the norm and 'The Orphanage' is not likely to change that.",5,17,21,12 January 2009
The Shining," Good film! Butis it really worth the status of `Horror Classic'??
","Stanley Kubrick's the Shining is a powerful cinema experience and a fine adaptation of Stephen King's novel, but I think the high status it enjoys is rather questionable. Too easily this film is labeled as the `scariest' horror film ever and many of the sequences are a bit overblown, if you ask me. Recently some website published the hundred scariest movie moments and multiple parts of the Shining positioned high in this list. True, legendary sequences like Jack Nicholson screaming `Heeeeeeeeere's Johnny!' and the little boy approaching room 237 on his tricycle look impressive when seen separate, but when you watch this film as a wholesome (like the way it was intended, naturally) it loses some of its power. I think Stanley Kubrick himself is to blame for this. Often during the Shining, he undercuts the tension himself by showing repetitive images and underdeveloped ideas. The cause of Jack Torrance's madness isn't explained like it should be and comes a bit sudden (in case you're not familiar with the plot: Jack Nicholson's character suffers from a writer's block and accepted a job as caretaker in a famous Colorado hotel, during the dead-of-winter. Along with his wife and son, he spends the winter up there while the isolation and impact of previous drama's that took place there slowly cause Jack to go insane and threat his family with an axe). Not a bad word about Stanley Kubrick and his (almost) flawless career, but I feel he's to blame for the partially missed opportunity that is The Shining. All the other necessary elements to create a horror milestone are there. The setting is uniquely isolated and perfect for the story. The cinematography (by John Alcott, who previously worked with Kubrick for Barry Lyndon and A clockwork Orange) simply is outstanding and the acting is GREAT! That surely has to be said: Jack Nicholson gives one of his most amazing performances of his already brilliant career. Really, Jack's facial expressions often make you wonder whether he isn't the reincarnation of the devil himself! Especially in The Shining, he's the kind of guy you don't want to mess with! Good film and certainly recommended butthink twice before ranking it as `essential'",4,9,23,5 May 2004
American Beauty," Look closer...indeed
","The tagline of this film is 'Look Closer...' Well, indeed you should. Look closer and you'll see this is NOT the most original and realistic story ever, this is NOT the best directorial debut ever and this is certainly NOT the masterpiece everybody claims it to be...Well what is it than ? It's an average, rather boring film but, with great performanes from the whole cast. You have to give it that, the whole cast couldn't be better and as for Spacey : he really deserved the Oscar. But all this can't save the film from boredom. In general, I like 'weird' characters. I loved Donnie Darko and he's pretty weird. But these are just way over the top. It ain't very psychological to film a plastic bag for 15 minutes and see the beauty of life in it. That Wes Bentley guy beats it all by the way. I don't believe a weirdo with a camera can sell drugs and make a fortune out of it. When such a guy came to a normal school he would get beaten up ! Especially if he wears that stupid hat. I do have to admit this film has an impact on you when you watch it the first time. It all seems very risky and innovating and especially the characters make a lot of impression to you. So, yeah, the first time I saw it I liked it and I wanted to see it again. But when that happened I really wonder WHAT exactly it was that fascinated me so much. It just seemed boring and so sloooooooooooooooooow. The 3rd time I saw it ( right before this review ) I thought it was a complete mess. Only the actors get some credit after this viewing. Everybody claims Sam Mendes ( Director ) is the best thing since sliced bread, but he sure is not in my opinion. Road to Perdition was boring as well. There were a lot of good films in 1999, The Green Mile to name just one, who all were a lot better than this one. I recommend them ! And if you do want to see this...make sure you only watch it once. My humble opinion : 3,5 / 10",Null,3,8,25 June 2003
Edward Scissorhands," A dark magical fairy-tale
","I realize this is just one man's opinion, but I think it's impossible NOT to love this movie. Whatever you seek in a film...you will find it Edward Scissorhands. It's one of the greatest stories ever told and easily one of the best films ever. Tim Burton is a wonderful director and this masterpiece has written his name all over it. Edward is not a normal human being. He wasn't born, he was created by an inventor who lived in a big, dark house on a hill. Unfortunately, the inventor died before he had the chance to complete Edward, so he has scissors instead of hands. Many years after the dead of the inventor, Peg Boggs (a sweet local lady who lives in the area of Edward's castle) takes him home with her.At first, everybody is intrigued by Edward and they all want to join in on his popularity. From the moment he was wrongfully accused of burglary, the all reject him. Besides the Boggs'family, and more importantly the daughter Kim, they all turn their back to him. Many things in this films could be considered as pure genius. For example the moral that true love comes from within. Edward is considered as a hideous creature by Kim at first. But she realizes that he's the only man that loves her the most. Edward Scissorhands also comments the life in small communities a lot. Gossiping woman meet on the corner, the people look into each others houses...This films really shows the hypocrisy of these people. The locations and decors are outstanding, to say the least. Edwards house and garden are perfect shots of beauty and macabre at the same time. Great work. And finally there are the acting performances. Johnny Depp does his best work under Tim Burton. The 3 film they made ( until now) are just perfect. Also, it's just impossible not to love Dianne Wiest in this film, she's the perfect cast in the role of the loving mother. So is the father played by Alan Arkin. And then there's Winona...Let me tell you, you haven't seen beauty until you see her dancing in the snow.",9,1,3,15 June 2003
Van Helsing," This must be a joke... A very irritating, BAD joke!
","Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney Jr. and all the other classic horror actors are turning in their graves right nowThe powerful, atmospheric tales they once made immortal are totally being messed up by a bunch of boisterous computer-effects freaks here! Biggest t**t of them all is 'director' Stephen Sommers, who seems to make a career out of destroying horror milestones. But at least his ugly 'The Mummy'-version had a bit of a story and followed some sort of structure. This film has absolutely NOTHING in it! Nothing, nada!! With horror, this hasn't got anything to doThe film is a whole playground for (awful) special effects and the latest computer gimmicks. In an incredibly clumsy way, the story lines of Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man and even Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde are being mixed here. Key-figure in it all is Van Helsing, played by Hugh 'Wolverine' Jackman. In the legendary original, Prof. Van Helsing was named Abraham and he had amazing literature knowledge. Now, he's called Gabriel, he works for the Vatican and I don't think he ever read a book. He has a James Bond collection of gadgets and  on top of it all  an irritating and unfunny monk following him around everywhere. Dracula is played by a meaningless fool, Frankenstein's monster all of a sudden seems to have an IQ of 150 and the Wolf Man couldn't look more fake. Sommers is constantly making up new horror-`rules' and he seems to think he can get away with everything. Kate Beckinsdale also walks around in this film. I'll be the very first to admit she's one good looking lady, but she can by no means act! Her character Anna constantly smashes with her head against walls, but she doesn't lose one drop of blood. I'm not going to waste further words to this film: It's terrible! Downright awful and the biggest insult to anyone who ever respected the horror genre. Before it's release already, we knew this wouldn't be a very intellectual approach of the genre, but Van Helsing even goes beneath your lowest expectations. It's irritating from start to finish and you'll more than once feel the need to get up and walk out on it. Death to Stephen Sommers and his entire computer entourage!",1,4,11,16 May 2004
Divergent," In the faction there's too much friction
","Okay, apparently the post 2010-world likes dystopian Sci-Fi/Fantasy fables made for, and preferably starring, teenage girls. I realize I'm just an old whiner, but these nowadays dystopian stories are soft and weak compared to the terrific and similarly themed films of the 70s, like 'Soylent Green' or 'Z.P.G'. What was the typical and almost even logical thing to do for Hollywood producers upon noticing the tremendous success of the adaptation of Suzanne Collins' 'The Hunger Games'? Find more reminiscent novels to turn into massively hyped and over-funded film franchises, of course! Neil Burger ('The Illusionist', 'Limitless') chose for the books written by the young author Veronica Roth. The main idea behind 'Divergent' certainly isn't too bad. In the soulless Chicago of the near future, society is divided into five different factions that each have their own color of clothing to illustrate what type of people they are, like grey for abnegation or blue for erudite. Children are born in the factions of their parents and can remain there for the rest of their lives, or they can choose to move to one of the four other factions at the age of sixteen. There exist psychological tests to help you decide which faction suits you the best, because once you made the choice it's forbidden to change again. When the seemingly ordinary teen Beatrice takes the test, however, the outcome is 'divergent' and this should be kept secret as divergent people are considered uncontrollable, rebellious and a menace to this formula of a peacefully structured society. Beatrice makes the instinctive but illogical choice to join the Dauntless faction, where she must battle daily to become accepted, becomes infatuated by the hunky but mysterious Four and stumbles upon a conspiracy to re-arrange the factions that looks an awful lot like genocide. As said, 'Divergent' certainly isn't bad and even qualifies as decent entertainment on a Friday night with a bucket of popcorn and a medium-sized beer, but the script is so frustratingly unsurprising and predictable! The supposedly clever plot twists, like the dark secrets of Four or the mysterious background of Tris' mother Nathalie, are so abundantly obvious that you honestly begin to question the level of intellect of the target audience. There isn't a single thing happening in 'Divergent' that you can't see coming from three railways stations away and, astonishingly enough, Neil Burger doesn't do anything to put his mark on the film. The action footage is very tame, clearly because the producers wanted to maintain the PG-13 rating no matter what, and the use of special effects or futuristic gimmicks is kept to a minimum, which makes you wonder on what they spent the massive $80 million budget. Perhaps on Kate Winslet's erudite haircut?",5,2,3,14 January 2019
Monsters vs. Aliens," A delightful treat for horror fans!
","The reviews that I've encountered on 'Monsters Vs. Aliens', both from professional and amateur authors, were largely negative and harsh ones, mostly claiming that the film doesn't have a real target audience. Animated movies are usually primarily aimed at young children but this movie is definitely 'scarier' than your average cartoon and even for the more adult audiences the script it too full of subtle references and little tributes to the world of ancient 50's B-cinema. I even read in one specific review that 'Monsters Vs. Alien' is the out-of-control project of a couple of obsessive and nerdy film-fanatics and can probably only be enjoyed by other obsessive and nerdy film-fanatics. Well, I am a obsessive and reasonably nerdy – at least when it comes to old horror and Sci Fi movies – film fanatics and indeed I tremendously enjoyed this film; thank you very much! I never dreamed I would ever see an animated movie that brings homage to long-forgotten (at least I assumed they were) and shamefully underrated cinematic milestones like 'Creature from the Black Lagoon', 'The Blob' and 'The Fly'! And then to think these titles are only just the famous sources of inspiration. I really couldn't believe my eyes when I spotted references towards much smaller and even charmingly clumsy Sci-Fi films like 'Mothra', 'The Thing from Another World', 'It Came from beneath the Sea', 'The Amazing Colossal Man' and 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'. To me – although we stated clear that I'm just an obsessive and nerdy fan boy – this is all the more proof that horror and Sci-Fi, and monster mania flicks in particular, are not dead genres. Even though you're not familiar with the era of 50's monsters, the over-the-top grotesque ideas and situations of mass hysteria still definitely inspire the nowadays generation of scriptwriters and, in spite of what a lot of people think, with success!On the day of her long anticipated wedding with the ambitious weatherman Derek Dietl, the beautiful Susan gets hit by a radioactive meteorite and almost instantly grown into enormous proportions. Much against her will, Susan – now renamed Ginormica - is taken to a secret government lair where she's locked up amongst other monsters, like The Missing Link, a blob-like creature, a gigantic moth and a genius but mad scientist with the body of a cockroach. When the evil alien super villain Gallaxhar threatens to destroy the world, however, their guardian General Monger releases the monsters to fight back. It's true that the story of 'Monsters Vs. Aliens' occasionally feels rushed and the creators didn't take enough time to properly introduce the magnificently versatile cast of characters and their fascinating background. On the other hand, though, this is an animated movie and nobody wants to watch a three hour cartoon, right? 'Monsters Vs. Aliens' is fast-paced, witty, incredibly clever and chock-full of hilarious situations and adorable inside jokes. Especially the character of dim-witted B.O.B and self-indulgent evil alien Gallaxhar are downright hilarious. The computer animation and design is damn close to perfection and even the 3-D gimmicks were aptly chosen. Also, Dreamworks made some excellent choices in Hollywood names to provide these delightful B-animation-movie characters with the exact right voice, like Reese Witherspoon as Ginormica, Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach PhD, Kiefer Sutherland as General Monger and Seth Rogen as B.O.B. Don't even bother reading the bashful guarantees; I'm an obsessive nerd and I say this is the best animated movie out there, along with Kung Fu Panda.",8,1,2,22 December 2009
The Machinist," I...can't...get....no...sleep!
","Well, in his impressive and and literally exhausting film 'The Mashinist', Brad Anderson certainly showed us what we DON'T ever want to become: insomniacs! Pitiful Trevor Reznik hasn't slept in a whole year, he's not much more than skin and bones and he has to write down memo notes on yellow post-its and stick them on the fridge, in order to remember them the next day. Trevor's condition goes from bad to even worse when he starts to spot imaginary colleagues and becomes a real danger for his fellow workers at the industrial factory. Gradually, Trevor's growing insanity leads to little clues and flashback-sequences that hint at a traumatizing event in the past and involving all the people in his surrounding. Wow, I can honestly say I was impressed by this movie! Unlike most horror fans, I didn't really care about Anderson's previous film 'Session 9', despite it being dark and quite clever, but 'The Machinist' is so much more involving and bitter. First and foremost, there's the masterful performance by Christian Bale and the jaw-dropping metamorphosis he went through, prior to filming. The amount of weight he lost, the impact on his own personal health... What Bale achieved here is a lot more than just preparing for a role, but it worked, since you stare at him with amazement every time he looks at his own exhausted body in the mirror. The story is really good as well, albeit nothing original and rather predictable at some points. Anderson patiently and professionally builds up a tense atmosphere and he devoted much time to selecting the absolute darkest and most depressing set pieces. The factory where Trevor works, for example, is a truly uncanny place filled with unfriendly people and dangerous machinery. Bale might be drawing most of the attention to him, but there still are some supportive roles that are definitely worth mentioning, like Jennifer Jason Leigh as the warm-hearted prostitute who comforts Trevor and Michael Ironside as his co-worker. The cinematography and narrative style of 'The Machinist' are very sober, which of course suits the tone of the film best, but inevitably this also resulted in a totally unglamorous cinema release and an almost unnoticed DVD edition. That really is a shame and very unjust. This film may not be everybody's taste, but it's powerful horror/thriller film-making that can't be overlooked. Highly recommended!",9,11,19,22 April 2006
Control," It's not just love that tore him apart
","Perhaps I'm extremely biased because I'm a big fanatic of the British New Wave music founders – and Joy Division in particular – but 'Control' is truly one of the best and most astounding biographies I ever beheld! This movie had me staring at the TV-screen with my eyes, ears and mouth wide open from the beginning till the very end of the closing credits. This film does not only describe the regrettably short life of Ian Curtis, singer and songwriter of the influential band called Joy Division, it completely also plays like his life: modest, depressing, anxious, sober, careful and saddening. 'Control' is primarily a portrait of a struggling man instead of an aspiring band. The prompt and relatively fast rise of Joy Division is merely a footnote in the story of a talented young man who seemingly never had the ambition of becoming an international music star. Ian Curtis' life differs tremendously from all the other musicians in the world. He proposed to join a struggling band named Warsaw as a singer simply to help them out. He wrote songs about the things he saw happening around him ('She Lost Control' is a beautiful example) and never even intended to quit his day job by his own initiative. Whereas all his fellow band members and young manager are trying to make the name Joy Division known and famous to the public, Ian Curtis married his teenage love and had a child. The increasing success of Joy Division is inversely proportional to the downwards spiral of Ian Curtis as an individual. His continuous anxiety causes the condition of epilepsy, he becomes dependent to heavy medication, loves two women at the same time and he can't bring himself to enjoy his newly obtained fatherhood. Ian Curtis committed suicide one day prior to the band's very first scheduled USA tour and without ever leaving behind a farewell note or a cry for help. His life story was a tragic one, and Anton Corbijn's film is a perplexing re-telling of the barely four years of vital events that brought this talented young man down. Of course, Anton Corbijn very much knew what he was filming about. This native Dutch director started out as a music photographer in the 70's and developed into a music video director for acclaimed bands like R.E.M, Depeche Mode and Metallica. Apparently the band Joy Division fascinated him since the beginning and nearly 30 years after Ian Curtis' death, he finally realized his much ambitioned biography project with the help of the memoirs of Curtis' widow Deborah Curtis (depicted in the film by Samantha Morton). 'Control' also largely relies on brilliant casting and dedicated performances. The actors do not only look a lot like the original Joy Division/New Order band members, they also actually learned to play the Joy Division songs themselves. And extremely well, I may add, as illustrated through clips of 'Transmission', 'Digital' and 'Dead Souls'. Sam Riley, a relatively unknown actor from West Yorkshire, truly gives a tour-de-force performance as Ian Curtis and too often it really felt as if I was watching archive footage of the real Joy Division singer. Anton Corbijn creates the exact right atmosphere through long sequences of silence, moody black and white photography and rudimentary set pieces. The soundtrack contains works from other music geniuses like David Bowie, Roxy Music and Iggy Pop. A must see movie.",9,1,2,7 February 2010
The Exorcist," Good film... but no masterpiece
","I've seen the Exorcist quite a few times by now (including the director's cut or the so-called 'version you've never seen') but not once did I feel like I was watching a true masterpiece. It's a solid film with intriguing characters and groundbreaking premise but it depends too much on only a few powerful and mesmerizing sequences instead of a being a coherent wholesome. The truly eerie images of a possessed 12-year-old girl cursing and mutilating herself are very shocking but the all the rest sadly isn't much more than a dramatic family portrait and a Catholic essay on evil. Don't get me wrong.I also regard this as an essential movie and one of the few films that co-formed the horror genre but I definitely think it's a slightly overrated. The story develops rather slowly and it lacks involvement. Once the 'Devil' makes his entry, Friedkin and the cast take you for a wild ride of shocks, ahead-of-its-time brutality and unseen atmosphere but it finishes as abrupt as it started. Luckily, there's the class-A cast, of which all members bring extra depth to their characters. Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow are impressive but yet my vote for best actor here goes to Lee J. Cob who adds some welcome humor to the devastating substance. The young Linda Blair made herself immortal and she still is everybody's favorite head-tolling girl. The rude voice of Mercedes Cambridge (who dubbed the 'Pazuzu'-lines) only gives more impact to the image of evil. Anyway, no matter how sublime the soundtrack isno matter how strong the reputation is by nowThe Exorcist certainly is not the scariest movie ever. As far as I'm concerned, it isn't even the best tale handling about 'religious evil' (check out 'The Omen' for that). Let's just say it is fundamental viewing in case the horror genre fascinates you.A few words about the re-edited anniversary release: aside from a very professionally made digital soundtrack, there isn't much to discover extra. There's the notorious sequence in which Regan (Linda Blair) rushes down the stairs spider-style but those 5 seconds are hardly worth purchasing the special edition. Other than this sequence, the re-release stresses the Catholic treatise even more (with lots of pointless talking) which actually makes the film dull and uninteresting at times. And it's really hurts to use those words while describing a classic title.",6,7,16,25 December 2004
Saw III," Getting Jigsawwy with it...
","Jigsaw and his female accomplice Amanda, two sadistic serial killers with WAY too much free time on their hands, return in this third  and definitely not last  installment of the successful 'Saw' franchise. It's just more of the same, really, only a lot grosser, as director Darren Lynn Bousman treats us to extended images of an open brain surgery as well as a wide variety of other stomach-churning scenes. 'Saw III' is a really extreme and sick film, better not to be seen immediately after dinner, and a vast improvement over the mediocre second entry but still lacking far too many elements to be labeled as good horror. The script's main problem is that, exactly like with the first two, it tries to be overly complex and intelligent even though it totally doesn't fit the overall tone of the film. John 'Jigsaw' Cramer developed into some kind of wise prophet with his endless speeches about the value of life and remission, but he's really just a pathetic old man who can't swallow he's terminally ill and the rest of his surroundings are not! Most people in this situation go into therapy or join internet forums, but instead John lethally punishes the people that too easily take their lives for granted. But according to him he's not a murderer! No, no...he even despises murderers. He simply 'tests' people. Yeah right. Amanda, a former junkie whose eyes were opened by Jigsaw, assists the bed-ridden lunatic in his new diabolical plan centering on a female doctor who doesn't treat her patients tactful enough and a man who's confronted with the people that were responsible for his son's death. She needs to keep Cramer alive otherwise her head is blown up and he has to find the power to pardon the people who ruined his life or he'll die himself. The surprise & shock effect of the fist film have completely vanished, so you're not very impressed anymore whenever a character threatens to get killed by some type of inventively fabricated device. And there are plenty of those, for example one girl has to reach into a jar filled with acid to find a key that'll get the bomb-collar of her neck and one poor sucker is tied to a floor and flooded with pig-intestines! Gross!! Otherwise, 'Saw III' is a rather lackluster film. It's roughly edited and very, very dark. Not talking in terms of atmosphere here, but just...dark! Lightbulbs apparently weren't included in Bouseman's filming budget and thus many scenes are just shot in the dark. For some reason, the character of Amanda (played by Shawnee Smith) also suffers from completely pointless flashbacks. It's an admirable attempt of our director to try and connect the three films together, but his intentions are too ambitious and his style too hyperactive. The tremendous amounts of graphic violence and blood was more than good enough for me. Oh yes, there WILL be blood.",5,2,7,16 December 2006
Resident Evil," 'Do you wish to save game?' ...Not really.
","'Resident Evil' is a LOT better than I ever hoped it would be and, even though it still isn't a very good movie, that's quite a big compliment. It's based on a video game (Capcom's hugely successful video game, to be more specific) and usually that's not a very good sign, since all those game-based horror movies have absolutely no story construction and the special effects as well as the set pieces always look far too hectic. 'Resident Evil' looks good, very good even, and the story is surprisingly endurable, despite being first-class nonsense of course. The film is also very gory and action-packed but the only thing it totally hasn't got are genuine frights. And I heard that rather disappointed the fans of the game (personally, I never played it) because that is generally acclaimed to be really terrifying with disturbing images and unsettling graphics. The movie opens bustling and to-the-point, with employers of the Umbrella Corporation (a company that pretty much took over the world economy at the beginning of the 21st century) getting trapped after the outbreak of a dangerous virus. The large building complex  referred to as 'the Hive'  is located underground and a team of heavily armed commandos, accompanied by two security guards with amnesia, have to invade it for further investigation. Once inside the Hive, the team encounters many unpleasant surprises like zombie-employers, mutant Dobermans, hi-tech anti-burglary measures and a top-secret army project with a gigantic tongue! After the captivating opening, 'Resident Evil' rapidly turns into a routine horror/action movie with blunt characters and atrocious dialogues. Paul W.S. Anderson borrows many ideas and style-aspects from other genre films, like 'The Matrix', 'Aliens' and George A. Romero's trilogy of the Dead. Michelle Rodriguez and Milla Jovovich are tolerable as the tough girls, but they work too hard on their bad-ass-image. Would a smile, if only a little one, have hurt them? The rest of the cast is filled with adequate performers even though they'll most likely never get a star on Hollywood Boulevard. Anderson's directing skills have obviously improved since 'Mortal Kombat' and 'Event Horizon', as this accomplishment looks a lot more surefooted. 'Resident Evil' is a very watchable film but I still don't regret having waited patiently to see it until it aired on television. There are a handful of admirable moments (my favorite remains the death-by-laser scene) but overall it remains a boisterous mess.",5,2,5,10 December 2005
Independence Day," Low-profile Americans save the world...yippy-ka-yee!
","A massive, gigantically overhyped production that actually is one big B-movie! Independence Day only retells and steals multiple plot aspects from a thousand modest science fiction movies from back the 50's and add an unhealthy dose of patriotism. A couple of days before the celebration of the 4th of July, giant metal spaceships overshadow the largest cities of the world. The first part of Independence Day is filled with impressive explosions, apocalyptic demolitions and grotesque action. Apparently, the alien visitors are a bit hostile and cheerfully blow up the White House and they make president Pullman a  widower. In the second part of the film, Independence Day entirely sinks into idiocy with Roswell '47 connections and Area 51 confessions. It also is in this part that the heroes start to rise. How about a stripper who single-handedly saves the First Lady? Or a redneck farmer who saves the world, kamikaze-style? A wannabe-NASA pilot who gets to fly a UFO or a divorced Jewish mastermind who cracks the alien code? It's all extremely silly and light-headed, but the moral is still there: Don't mess with Americans! Still, with the right, low-brained attitude you can enjoy this film. The jokes and oneliners are so bad and wrongly placed they become hilarious at times. The aliens, on the other hand, look cool. Nice cast as well, with good sounding names like Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman and Randy Quaid. On paper, Randy Quaid's name might look like the worst casting job ever but, regarding the characteristics of his role, it fits him perfectly.",4,12,26,23 May 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Good film, surprisingly raw and obscure!
","Although the twisted premise of 'The Butterfly Effect' definitely sounded like my cup of tea, I was reluctant to go and see it right away, simply because I feared that the film would revolve too much on the popular teen-idol Aston Kutcher and also because it was very likely that sentiment and feel-good twists would overrule the obscurity of the basic story. Well, I'm happy to admit that I was totally wrong (happens quite often) and that 'The Butterfly Effect' is, in fact, a powerful and honest thriller. Unlike other nowadays so-called thrillers that star popular names, the directors of this film are not afraid to add despair and in-your-face shocks, which makes it an involving and often unsettling cinema effort. Kutcher, these days better known as Demi Moore's toy-boy, also proves himself to be a fairly strong actor, capable of showing a wide range of emotions. He stars as Evan, an adolescent who suffers from severe blackouts every time he faces a trauma or difficult moment. He learns that, through these blackouts, he can cause a time warp and travel back to his childhood years when he and his circle of friends made some horrible, future-defining mistakes. He can then alter the past for everyone involved, which makes the film feel like a amalgamation of 'Stand By Me' and 'Time Cop'. This mood-setting introduction is already quite good, with nice character developing and some hard sequences (Eric Stoltz in his vicious basement!) but the film even gets better when it seems that every time-travel goes horribly wrong. The moral of the story thus is that life can never be satisfying for everybody at once and that certain sacrifices eventually seems inevitable. You know that you've been watching a good film when you and the people you've seen it with are still discussing the story (and more particularly, the climax) hours after finishing it. 'The Butterfly Effect' is such a film.",7,3,7,17 October 2005
District 9," I'm an Alien. I'm a legal Alien... I'm a Prawn in Jo'Burg!
","Although seemingly quite the hype in the rest of the world, 'District 9' got unleashed into theaters in my country without much publicity or commotion. It's only playing in cinemas with the largest number of screens and if I hadn't coincidentally checked what was playing in theaters this week, maybe I would have missed it completely. I've read in the trivia section that the American marketing campaign included interactive posters with phone numbers that upset citizens could call, but here in Belgium there weren't even any trailers. Too bad, actually, because 'District 9' is an imaginative low-budget movie that for once really deserves to lure as many curious film fanatics to cinemas. Unlike other over-hyped blockbusters of this type, like for example 'Cloverfield', this film contains a large amount of genuinely ingenious ideas and a truckload of very effective social commentary. 'District 9' differs immensely from the average type of alien invasion movies and is actually more of a pitch-black comedy slash political satire instead of a Sci-Fi. The coolest and most inventive aspect about the entire concept already comes at the beginning, with the arrival of a mysterious spaceship on earth, but not in New York or Paris or any major Western city, but above the 'crime capital of the world' Johannesburg in South Africa of all places! After nearly twenty years of silence and no attempt of the aliens to seek contact, soldiers eventually break into the spacecraft and discover a severely weakened race of aliens they baptize Prawns because of their hideous appearances. The South African government is now 'stuck' with the aliens, and since they're unable to integrate in society, they put them into a township called District 9. Today, in the year 2010, ambitious social worker Wikus Van Der Merwe is assigned to finally evict all the Prawns one by one, but during his round he accidentally comes into contact with an alien liquid and gradually turns into a prawn himself. Now fleeing from his own government, since he has become an eagerly wanted study object all of a sudden, Wikus discovers that human never had any good intentions with the Prawns and simply wanted to dissect and study them and obtain accessibility to their powerful weapons. Particularly the first half of 'District 9' is downright brilliant and jaw-dropping original, because writer/director Neill Blomkamp fantastically illustrates the South African living conditions of poor people. I've spent two months in that country myself (though in Cape Town and not Johannesburg) and can actually confirm that these Townships are disastrous places where often two million people live together on a couple of square kilometers, in terribly ramshackle cabins with barely any running water. These places gradually sew despair and they are breeding grounds for criminal gangs. The alien intruders in Blomkamp's are actually just oppressed South African people; locked away in townships and given the negative image of being a 'financial burden' to bear by the rest of the country's population. Blomkamp's film, in documentary style with interviews and seemingly live action reporting, is masterfully compelling and – even with the implausible premise of alien intruders – feels incredibly authentic. The second half of 'District 9' is a lot less interesting, since the script reverts to violent shoot-outs and rather indigestible sentimental plot lines. The infected Wikus teams up with the most intelligent member of the Prawn species to fix the spacecraft and find an antidote for Wikus' deteriorating condition. The subtle social criticism gradually vanishes during this second half, as there are a lot of agitated confrontations with military forces and Nigerian crime syndicates. In spite of the relatively low budget of $30 million, the film has amazing special effects and make-up art. The unknown cast does a terrific job and the overall tone of the film – in spite of the harsh political topics – is spirited and energetic. Can't wait to see what Blomkamp does next, whether or not with the welcome help of producer Peter Jackson.",8,3,6,25 October 2009
Batman Begins," Very good...but something's missing.
","I don't like to comment on giant blockbusters because their humongous fan base usually doesn't appreciate criticism of any kind. Oh well, my rant here contains more 'remarks' than actual criticism, so I'm going to spill my guts anyway. Although a very good film (and definitely a vast improvement over those dreadful Joel Schumacher films) there's something essential missing in Christopher Nolan's reprising of the Batman-franchise: comic-book darkness! Whether intended or not, 'Batman Begins' doesn't seem to take place in an imaginary world where good battles evil but in a real-life drama setting where every individual has to fight for survival Basically not a bad idea at all, but it's not exactly the ideal setting to have a man flying around, wearing a bat-suit. Bruce Wayne ought to be a superhero but instead he's an emotionally and physically vulnerable man with phobias and no sense of morbid humor. Also, the gimmicks and designs are a lot less exhilarating than they should be. For example: the Bat-mobile here is nothing but a car-tuned Hum-V and Gotham City looks an awful lot like an (even more) pauperized version of New York. Yes, the script is very solid and the cast is terrificbut by no means this 'new' Batman can live up to the unequaled and blackly ingenious Tim Burton movies that launched the hype about 15 years ago. The film's opening (featuring a young Bruce Wayne on a meditation tour in Tibet) is long and complex but very interesting and a rewarding intro to the new Batman myth. When the story is then transferred to Gotham city, the movie becomes more action-packed and the class-A cast receives the opportunity to show off their talents. I particularly liked Gary Oldman in the (for him) awkward role of honest cop, Tom Wilkinson as the mighty underworld gangster and Rutger Hauer as the greedy and corrupt business manager. I personally found Michael Caine to be unfunny and sophomoric in his role of Alfred the butler and it was sad to see the role of Scarecrow played by a bizarre young nerd.",7,5,8,4 July 2005
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Routine sitcom humor, nicely wrapped in a gory format.
","'Tucker and Dale VS Evil' is basically the long-feature horror movie equivalent of all those pretty lame comedy sitcoms that my mother always watches You know, the ones where every single episode is exactly the same. It goes like this: everything begins with one small and extremely banal misunderstanding, like maybe something that someone has misheard or misinterpreted. Then subsequently, this banal misunderstanding takes on exaggeratedly humongous proportions. People overhear only parts of conversations, draw incorrect conclusions, revert to ancient clichés and suddenly every dialog/monologue is written in an ambiguous style. Admittedly it's rather strange that this derivative and overindulged formula nevertheless resulted in a movie that several hundreds of people have referred to as one of the best horror comedies ever and even upholds a powerful current 7.6/10 score here on IMDb. I'm certainly not claiming that I didn't like 'Tucker and Dale VS Evil', but I definitely think it's overrated. The basic idea to introduce two particularly sympathetic and downright stereotypical West-Virginian hillbillies and have THEM chased by a group of crazed and overly violent city teenagers (instead of vice versa) is undoubtedly original and close to brilliant. Especially with the revival of backwoods horror recently – there are the remakes of 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'The Hills Have Eyes' but also new popular franchises like 'Wrong Turn' and many others – there are numerous horror that generated a sort of universal fear of yokels. This makes especially the beginning of the movie very funny. The teenagers know all the urban legends and seen all the backwoods slasher movies, so they're petrified of Tucker and Dale during their first encounter at a remote gas station. They, on the other hand, are completely unaware of their horrific image and just act friendly. Their ignorance versus the close-mindedness of the teenagers results in a few hilarious moments. But then the accumulation of coincidences, unfortunate accidents and misunderstandings becomes just too absurd. Also, the gore in combination with slapstick only works in very small portions. Dumb kids impaling themselves or stupidly blowing their own brains out is not that amusing, in fact. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk give away amiable performances as the titular goody-two-shoes hicks and Katrina Bowden is just too cute as the only tolerant teenager. The rest of the cast forgettable and additional screen-filling.",6,6,19,30 November 2011
28 Days Later...," Uneven horror film, but with occasional flashes of sheer brilliance
","Back in good old Great Britain, Danny Boyle proves that he's still a gifted filmmaker even though his short Hollywood career wasn't as fruitful as initially hoped for. The opening sequences of this '28 Days Later' are downright astonishing and  for a moment  you suspect that you're about to watch to most brilliant horror film in a long, long time. Especially the already classic sequence in which Jim (Cillian Murphy) wanders through the entirely deserted streets of the otherwise so lively and crowded London, guided by disturbing music, is efficiently creepy. The plot centers on an extremely aggressive virus that turns people into blood-crazed maniacs. It's only 28 days since the virus was unleashed and the entire population is wiped away already, while a few lonely survivors desperately prepare for the total apocalypse. Jim is one of them, as he just awoke from a coma, completely unaware of the vile events that took place the past 28 days Even though the story isn't very original (Romero's 'The Crazies' come to mind as well as 'Last Man on Earth' and 'The Omega Man'), Danny Boyle succeeds in portraying a gripping mix of drama, action, suspense and  oh yes  gore! Now, I really wished I could end my user comment here and conclude that '28 Days Later' was a simply great new horror film but unfortunately the script takes a complete U-turn halfway and becomes a repetitive lesson in which Boyle and writer Alex Garland try to convince us that mankind still remains the biggest threat of all. The last survivors end up at a military post where their lives are even in bigger danger. The tension and carefully built up atmosphere disappears and is replaced by tedious macho speeches and gratuitous brutality. The acting performances in this film aren't very spectacular but that's understandable considering most cast-members are debuting here. The fact that this project was entirely filmed with digital cameras might be a nice trivia element, but I'm not too keen on this type of cinematography. Overall, Boyle's film is worthy viewing for horror fans but experienced fanatics won't be too impressed.",5,47,75,3 February 2005
It Follows," Relax, it's just sex Or is it?
","I'll admit that my main motivation to see 'It Follows' was probably the wrong one I didn't necessarily want to see it because it's labeled as one of the freshest, most original and genuinely frightening American horror movies of recent years, but I watched it because I was literally sick and tired of reading how everybody is talking about this movie on film forums! In the message boards section of this lovely website, for example, there are – without exaggerating – ten discussions going on about 'It Follows' on a daily basis and I got really fed up with avoiding all of them in order not to read any spoilers. Usually when a certain horror film is trending or being the hype of the moment, I postpone my personal viewing so that I can't get influenced too much by the opinions of others. There just isn't coming an end to the hype that is called 'It Follows' around here on the message boards. Since 7-8 months non-stop already, everybody shouts out his/her opinion and most of them are very positive and enthusiastic. And is 'It Follows' really worthy of all this interactive attention and mouth-to-mouth publicity? No, of course not I don't think that any film should receive this much exposure, in fact, except maybe in case Alfred Hitchcock would rise from his grave and direct 'Psycho V: Happy Mother's Day'. But hey, at the same time I will gladly admit that 'It Follows' quite a few positive aspects going for it. More positive than negative ones, in fact. The basic plot concept is original as well as unsettling, the soundtrack and several unexpected scenes are genuinely petrifying and most of the lead protagonists come across as authentic and identifiable young adults. The successful combination of all these aspects already makes 'It Follows' a dozen times better than the vast majority of US-horror releases nowadays, since most of them are either redundant remakes or lame direct-to-DVD zombie comedies. The cute and friendly girl-next-door Jay Height thinks that she found happiness with her hunky new boyfriend Hugh. However, after they made love for the first time in the backseat of his cool car, everything changes abruptly. It seems as if Hugh was only looking for a victim to physically pass on a terrible kind curse. Since the sex, Jay gets stalked by nightmarish entities and ghastly figures. Jay's closest friends want to help, but naturally no one else sees the entities that she sees, and passing it on herself via casual sex doesn't necessarily make her safe. So, the idea is very good and the handful of genuine shock/fright moments likewise, but sadly the film also contains far too many boring and pointless footage. Writer/director David Robert Mitchell often undercuts the suspense by overlong dialogs and extended scenes of absolutely nothing. Unfortunately he also knows that his script is fairly clever, so several twists (especially near the finale) feel somewhat pretentious. Don't count on proper explanations either, of course. That being said, I would still definitely recommend horror genre fans to check out 'It Follows', even if it were only for the downright fantastic soundtrack by Disasterpeace. The music fits the atmosphere and grisly images perfectly, and it's arguably the greatest horror score since John Carpenter's music for his own classic 'Halloween'. By the way, I just had a daughter. In case this movie will stand the test of time and it becomes a cult classic, I will definitely show it to her in sixteen years or so. Before she starts dating and clubbing, just to make her think twice about random unsafe sex and one night stands; ha!",6,1,6,15 September 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Why 161 minutes?
","I can't deny it ... I'm an avid Quentin Tarantino admirer, and I will probably always remain an avid Quentin Tarantino admirer. The man simply is a genius when it comes down to writing dazzling dialogues, getting the most out of stellar ensemble casts and depicting extreme but delirious violence. QT also always was the only director of whom I tolerated exaggeratedly long movies. 'Pulp Fiction', 'Kill Bill', 'Inglorious Bastards', etc, it never bothered me that they lasted two and a half hours. But since, say, 'Django Unchained', I'm noticing an increasingly worrying trend when I watch his newest movies. They are getting too long and far too tedious. They are generally still fine films, but when re-watching, I find myself fast-forwarding the overlong dialogues and only focusing on the violent parts. In case of 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood', I'm afraid I'll be skipping the full first two hours!It's interesting to watch once, perhaps, but the fan-boy fantasy tale of 'Hollywood in the Sixties' that Tarantino penned down is honestly quite dull, repetitive and substantially void. It's literally just endlessly long sequences of Leonardi DiCaprio (a washed-up TV-western idol from the 50s) rehearsing his lines for a new show, Brad Pitt (an unemployed stunt double) feeding his dog and cruising around LA to pick up young hippie girls, and Margot Robbie (as Sharon Tate) parading around town and looking at herself on the big screen. You probably read it before in other reviews, but it's a sad truth: absolutely nothing interesting happens, and some sequences - notably when Brad Pitt 'trespasses' into the hippie trailer park - are even downright pathetic. The last forty minutes are fabulous, though. You may regain consciousness as soon as you see the message '6 months later' appear on the screen. As an enormous fan of Italian exploitation of the sixties & seventies, I really adored how Tarantino sent DiCaprio's actor character to Rome and star in exhilarating trash titles like 'Nebraska Jim', 'Shoot Ringo, said the Gringo' or 'Operazione Dyn-O-Mite!'. When returning to their home in the Hollywood Hills, they are confronted with members of the notorious Manson Family that are out to kill Sharon Tate and her friends, but Quentin Tarantino gives history a sort of absurdly cool twist. The climax isn't so surprising or innovative if you have seen 'Inglourious Bastards', but at least it finally provides the movie with what I had desperately been anticipating for more than two hours: sick, extreme and unhinged violence!",5,7,11,27 November 2019
Get Out," What's happening here? This doesn't feel right!
","I've been a fan of horror movies and thrillers ever since I figured out how the TV worked. Always preferred older movies but also always kept my eyes and mind open for new instant classics. The problem is that so very few REALLY good horror movies come out nowadays, and when I read exaggeratedly praising and positive reviews about an alleged new masterpiece, I automatically become skeptical. Jordan Peele's 'Get Out' was such an example. Literally everybody, acclaimed critics as well as ordinary mainstream audiences, was mad-raving enthusiast about 'Get Out' and now it's even nominated for several Oscars, including best picture and best screenplay! I honestly must admit I never expected that a film like this would ever become nominated for the most important categories in such a hypocrite and predetermined contest for the elite. It'll never win, of course, but still. It must be underlined that 'Get Out' isn't groundbreakingly original, extremely intelligent or a genuine masterwork of scripting. There are, however, many things that the film - and the debuting director Jordan Peele in particular - does exceptionally well. First and foremost, the atmosphere! Although not featuring any graphic violence for the largest part of the film, the atmosphere is continuously ominous and hinting at something dreadful that can occur at any given moment. There's only a very selected number of classic horror films that uphold the 'there's something terribly wrong here' sentiment for so long, and it provides 'Get Out' with the same unique vibe as pure classics like 'Seconds', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and 'The Stepford Wives' (the 1975 original, of course, not the idiotic Nicole Kidman remake). Secondly, you just cannot surpass Peele's truly unsurpassable approach of racial differences! Without explicitly mentioning about racial tension or introducing obviously racist characters, Peele shows that racial segregation is irreversibly integrated in our modern day social culture. This aspect of 'Get Out' is indescribably unique, in fact. The harder the protagonists try to profile themselves as anti-racist, the more uncomfortable you get with them. Equally brilliant in this domain are the setting, costumes and tiny little details. The word 'slavery' is never said out loud, yet look at the Armitage mansion, the style of their household staff and the crucial role of cotton at a certain point. Thirdly, and this is a joint effort with the ensemble cast, the performances in 'Get Out' are extremely high standard. Atypical role or not, Daniel Kaluuya truly deserves the Best Actor nomination for his depiction of the insecure, skeptical and visibly petrified Chris Washington. What's the story about, then? Well, I'm convinced that 'Get Out' is one of those films for which they invented the rule of: 'the less you know the better'. Personally, I think that even rudimentary elements like the title or the cast list already reveal too much. If I was Jordan Peele, I would have named the film 'What is happening here?' or 'This doesn't feel right', but of course I respect their choice from a marketing point of view. I'm well aware of the fact that most reviews provide at least a brief synopsis or hint at vital twists in the third act, but my advice is to know as little as possible before you watch. I can't finish the review without mentioning that 'Get Out' isn't flawless. Notably the comic relief aspect, provided mainly by Lil Rel Howery , isn't the least bit impressive and even somewhat misplaced. In a way, Jordan Peele is guilty of racial stereotyping himself with this, although I reckon it was a deliberate choice. He's a comedian, after all.",8,24,49,2 March 2018
Insidious," Impressive, atmosphere-driven horror.
","Titles that spontaneously spring to mind when reviewing 'Insidious' are 'Poltergeist', 'The Haunting' and 'The Exorcist'. Now, you'll have to admit that there are far worse movies in the genre to get compared with! 'Insidious' is another collaboration between the multi-talented writer/actor Leigh Whannell and the multi-talented director James Wan. The duo was previously responsible for the original – and undoubtedly still the best – 'Saw' and the creepy ventriloquist chiller 'Dead Silence'. Especially compared to their gore-soaked debut feature 'Saw', 'Insidious' is a completely different kind of horror movie. It's a mature and effectively slow-brooding horror story that thrives on atmosphere, intelligent plotting and a few imaginative themes that will keep even the most experienced and knowledgeable horror fanatics intrigued. The story opens like thirteen ghost movies in a dozen do A happy young family moves into their newly purchased dream house, but not much later their oldest son – presumably due to a banal fall from a ladder – slips into a mysterious coma that perplexes all medical experts. Renai, the mother, is convinced that somehow the new house is haunted and soon after begins to hear eerie noises through the baby monitor and see ghostly appearances in her boy's room. She manages to persuade her husband to move elsewhere, but when the strange paranormal occurrences continue, they get the professional help of a spiritual medium. She discovers that the son isn't suffering from an unknown illness, but that he's gifted with the ability to explore alternate dimensions during his sleep. Only,  he stepped across a dangerous boundary this last time. And, moreover, his gift seems to be hereditary Admittedly the first full hour of 'Insidious' is rather uneventful and very vague, but Wan and Whannell nevertheless succeed in keeping you confident that the wait will be worthwhile. You just sense that it won't be another routine and clichéd haunted-house thriller. The ambiance is similar and the clues point in that direction, but the films admirably comes with an innovative twists on the supernatural themes. The last half hour is very powerful and contains a handful of truly efficient 'jumpy' moments, albeit still without gore or expensive special effects! The last five minutes actually even qualify as the strongest horror finale I've seen in a few years. The acting performances are decent (great to see Barbara Hershey again!) and the set-pieces are well selected. I can only recommend this movie.",8,2,6,12 January 2012
The Number 23," 23, 2323 Moments of Sheer Silliness
","There was a time when Joel Schumacher was ranked quite high on my list of favorite directors. Back in the late 80's and early 90's, when his name was attached to several great films like 'The Lost Boys', 'Flatliners' and 'Falling Down', he truly was one of the most gifted directors in Hollywood. Then came the stupid 'Batman' sequels, unfortunately, and after that it seemed as if every potentially sublime screenplay turned into a gigantic mess in Schumacher's hands. Both '8MM' and 'Phone Booth' could have been much better films and even the incredibly imbecilic concept of 'The Number 23' should have been processed into a slightly more compelling and entertaining movie. Literally from start to finish, 'The Number 23' desperately attempts to be a mysterious and uncanny thriller and therefore uses all the dreadful clichés from the big book of cinema history, including heavy-voiced narration, flashbacks, disorderly structure, characters with multiple personalities, numerous plot twists that grow increasingly absurd and sinister asylum settings. Nothing helps, however, simply due to the sheer silliness of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired engagement of cast & crew. As much as you try to associate with the lead character and be open-minded regarding the insane theories, this still remains a movie about a two-digit number and two-digit numbers aren't scary. Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey in a rare non-comical role) is a bored animal trapper whose wife Agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday. The book tells about all sorts of devilish theories and strange coincidences that are linked to the number 23. Walter almost promptly identifies himself with the book's protagonist (a sleazy detective investigating a grim case of suicide) and begins to spot copious examples of the 23 enigma in his own private life. I did some research on Google and Wikipedia and, apparently, this whole 23 numerology nonsense really exists and certain people honestly believe that most catastrophes and accidents are directly connected to this evil number. Well, that's just  crazy! But hey, I'm not here to judge people's beliefs and fears, regardless of how demented they are, and I can only share my humble opinion on a movie that is based on an out-and-out berserk enigma. 'The Number 23' is not suspenseful, in spite of several gloomy set pieces and nasty make-up effects, and never at one point manages to make you contemplate about the role of numbers in your own life. All cast members perform below their normal capacities, but it was still nevertheless a joy to see the lovely Mrs. Virginia Madsen in a relatively big production again. Definitely not recommended in case you're looking for a solid and creepy evening of thriller fun, but endurable and not entirely without merit.",4,3,9,7 June 2009
Ghost Rider," Amazing Blaze
","Once, twice or maximum three times per year there comes a movie of which you beforehand know that it won't change your life with its progressive ideas or mesmerize your mind with its poetic dialogs, but nevertheless you simply have to watch it on the big screen, otherwise you risk missing out on something extraordinary cool! 'Ghost Rider' is such a movie, based on dark comic book characters and featuring a whole lot of spectacular action-stunts. It's definitely not a masterpiece or even very memorable, but thrills and entertainment are guaranteed throughout the entire playtime. It's a rather gruesome comic book adaptation, dealing with contracts with the devil and doomed souls, but the execution is light-headed and enthusiast. In order to save his father from slowly and painfully dying of cancer, young stunt rider Johnny Blaze gives up his soul to the devilish Mephistopheles. Several years later, Johnny Blaze is a successful daredevil stunt-rider who seemingly can't get injured, yet Mephistopheles approaches him to live up to his part of the contract. He'll become Ghost Rider, the devil's bounty hunter assigned to prevent Blackheart  a fallen angel - from unleashing a new hell on earth. There are a whole lot of sub plots, for example Johnny's reunion with his former girlfriend and the mysterious cemetery caretaker who suspiciously knows a lot about Johnny's dreadful situation, but the main focus here is Nicolas Cage's flamboyant outfits and fiery skull as he transforms into the Ghost Rider overnight. The battles between him and Blackheart's associates (representing the primary elements) are pretty exciting and the visual effects are competently presented. The action sequences result in a lot of damage and mayhem, which is always entertaining to behold from a comfortable seat in the theater. Cage is a terrific actor, clever enough to not take his role overly serious and therefore adds quite a lot of comical elements to his character, like dry one-liners and eccentric tics. It was particularly pleasant to see Peter Fonda star again in a big-budgeted production, especially considering the role he plays! Just a couple of days ago, I watched the movie 'Race With The Devil' in which a much younger Fonda desperately attempts to flee from a bunch of pursuing devil-worshipers, yet in this comic book vehicle, he plays the Devil himself and clearly enjoys it. The filming locations and the majority of set-pieces look effectively sinister, Eva Mendes is hot as ever, skull dude's motorcycle and armory is awesome and there even is a modern update of Johnny Cash' great song 'Ghost Riders in the Sky' on the soundtrack! I can't possibly talk too negative about a film like this. It's great, mindless entertainment.",7,3,9,26 February 2007
Hellboy," Red alert
","Hellboy joins the recent trend of popular comic book adaptations (X-Men, Spiderman) and unfortunately also the dire trend of movies that drown in computer engineered effects (like Underworld or Van Helsing). The good news is that it was directed and co-written by Guillermo Del Toro, who has a terrific sense of perspective. Hellboy doesn't take itself too serious and that's why it is a lot easier to digest than an overly pretentious film like Underworld, for example. I never read any of the Hellboy comics during my youth but that isn't a necessity in order to follow the film. Apparently, he's a demon awakened by the most stereotypical Nazi's you'll ever see and nursed by an American scientist (John Hurt). As a fully-grown demon, Hellboy serves the FBI as some sort of caretaker along with some other freaks of nature. There's an aqua-man that shows a lot of resemblance with the Creature from the Black Lagoon and Selma Blair who bursts into flames whenever she gets emotional. Blair's character seems to come right out of an X-Men comic. Hellboy features a few very cool gimmicks and  surprisingly enough  a couple of very atmospheric and eerie sequences like the one shot at the Russian cemetery when it's snowing. The plot is utterly thin but there's the outstanding performance by Ron Perlman as Hellboy to fill up the emptiness. Some of his one-liners are pathetically lame but his charisma and grimaces do the job. The big advantage about these comics-turned-into-films is that anything goes. Here you have Nazi's collaborating with Rasputin (?), Hellhounds in the subway and more of this cheerful crap. Hey, at least it was better than Daredevil.",7,2,4,26 October 2004
The Mist," There's something in the mist and it ain't gorillas!
","Whenever writer/director Frank Darabont takes on the repertoire of success-author Stephen King, you can rest assured a good movie will come out of it. Just look at the rating and prestige (especially around this website) of the previous collaborations 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Green Mile'. But hey, wait a minute, those movies were actual dramas that dealt with human emotions and serious issues like imprisonment, whereas 'The Mist' is obviously a more straightforward horror flick dealing with miscellaneous types of monsters! Well yeah, this is an entirely different film than the other two, but there still are many similarities as well. Basically you could claim 'The Mist' is a prison movie just as well, only the setting concerns a supermarket instead of an actual penitentiary, and the menacing eerie monsters on the outside quickly become submissive to the claustrophobia and fear of your fellow man that grows inside the walls of the supermarket. So yes, Frank Darabont delivers a much more brutal and horrific film here, but it nevertheless remains a highly sophisticated and intellectual movie that easily qualifies as one of the most intense and successful genre-accomplishments of the past ten years.The story opens with the inhabitants of a small town licking their wounds after a severe and destructive storm. Multiple people, among them artist David Drayton with his 5-year-old son and neighbor, intend to quickly go to the local supermarket for extra supplies but they never thought it would become their final trip. Whilst shopping and talking about the storm with fellow townspeople, an ominous and nearly impenetrable mist embraces the supermarket and isolates the building from the rest of the world. Everyone is trapped inside when it turns out the mist is infested with surreal and hideous monsters, like gigantic tentacles, flying reptiles, over-sized bugs with lethal stings and virulent arachnids. Meanwhile, the tension inside grows equally unbearable as David and a handful of others get in conflict with a bunch of religious freaks led by the uncanny Mrs. Carmody. This is possibly the most powerful aspect about 'The Mist': the increasing suspense within the supermarket and between human beings mutually is at least equally  if not more  disturbing and petrifying as the sequences where a couple of brave souls risk to set foot outside the store and into the unknown. The absolute 'coup-de-grâce' of Darabont's script comes at the very end, with a climax that is possible the most offbeat, unpleasant, depressing and anti-Hollywood I've ever seen in a reasonably big-budgeted and prominently produced film. Come to think of it, 'The Mist' rudimentary features everything you could possibly expect from a good horror movie. The opening sequences are straightforward and don't waste any time building up towards the essence of the story, the middle section is genuinely frightening and keeps you guessing what's going on and who the next victim will become, and then finally the ending is an extremely unhappy one that leaves you with a sour taste in your stomach. That doesn't necessarily mean 'The Mist' is entirely without flaws, of course. There are a couple of sad shortcomings, including the explanation of the bizarre events and the tacky use of CGI-effects. The story eventually reverts to the oldest cliché in the book to clarify the mist's origin (gee, do you think military experiments are involved?) and the film also proves that giant movie-monsters are most menacing when they remain unseen. The gigantic insects and particularly the pink tentacle nearly downgrade the film towards the level of a campy  but nonetheless amusing  80's B-movie.'The Mist' definitely also benefices from a talented cast of versatile and devoted actors and actresses. Many of them are friends and regular choices of director Frank Darabont (Jeffrey DeMunn, William Sadler, Laurie Holden) but they all perform splendid jobs. Thomas Jane is excellent as well in the leading role, but undoubtedly the most praise goes out to supportive cast members Marcy Gay Harden and Toby Jones. Harden plays the aforementioned 'leader' of the continuously expanding group of people who believe the events are a punishment from God. She's truly creepy in her role and you, the viewer, will definitely feel the urge to walk into the screen and eliminate her yourself. Toby Jones is particularly terrific since his character Ollie gradually develops from a measly shop assistant into an unlikely and brave anti-hero. His odd looks and small posture are clashing with his constant calm and sense of rationalism. Jones' performance is a truly impressive one. 'The Mist' is a great film and a worthy contender for the honoree title of best Stephen King horror adaptation.",8,2,5,31 August 2008
I Am Legend," Richard Matheson's Legend lives on ...
","By now, and ironically enough, novelist Richard Matheson has become a bit of a living legend himself. Countless of his screenplays resulted in terrific horror movies ('The Pit and the Pendulum', 'Night of the Eagle', 'Duel') and which other author can claim he lived to see no less than three cinematic adaptations of his most famous story? And it's about time someone updated the marvelous concept, as the other versions date back to the early 60's ('The Last Man on Earth', starring the formidable Vincent Price) and the early 70's (with Charlton Heston starring in 'The Omega Man'). From what I've heard and read there were earlier plans to accomplish a newer version, even acclaimed director Ridley Scott was interested during the 1990's apparently, but we still had to wait until now; for this tense and surprisingly unsettling film directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Will Smith.Well, personally, I'd say this post-millennium version of Matheson's timeless Sci-Fi story was well worth waiting for! The author wrote his novel 'I Am Legend' in the early fifties  1954 if I'm not mistaken  but the plot's impact is still as powerful as ever, and with the nowadays available & computerized techniques filmmakers can really re-create the apocalyptic ambiance like Matheson truly intended it. The earliest sequences showing the completely forsaken and bewildered avenues of New York City are, alongside Will Smith's perplexing performance, deeply impressive and memorable. This is probably the only movie ever that features deers running over Times Square! Smith portrays one of the most legendary fictional characters ever, Robert Neville, and the film starts three years after the feared Krippen Virus exterminated the earth's entire population. During the daytime, Neville wanders through the abandoned streets of NY and desperately attempts not to go insane due to his loneliness. He has mature conversations with his loyal dog Sam (a beautiful and intelligent German Shepard) as well as with mannequin dolls he randomly placed in a DVD store. He also continues to search for an antidote, because he still believes he can reverse the virus and save humanity. At night he has to hide for the so-called Dark Seekers. They are former human beings who survived the virus, but it nevertheless transformed them into monstrous creatures that can't stand daylight and prowl the streets at night for food. Will Smith's one man show as the supposed last man on earth is staggering, petrifying, poetic and saddening all at the same time. Through brief flashbacks we also gradually learn what exactly happened to his own family members during the times of the virus' outbreak, and these sequences only make his sense of perseverance more admirable. The Dark Seekers are reasonably menacing, but still a little too CGI for my taste. I still prefer the primitive zombies of 'Last Man on Earth' and even the rather silly looking albinos of 'The Omega Man' had more apocalyptic charm. Notwithstanding, some of the sequences involving Neville and his dog versus the Dark Seekers are genuinely eerie and atmospheric. Unlike many of my fellow reviewers around here apparently, I also really liked how the screenplay left a lot of questions unanswered and how it allows the viewers to contemplate about the missing parts themselves. For example, the movie never shows any footage of the three devastating years between the outbreak of the virus and the setting of the film. However, I do agree with the vast majority of reviewers regarding the disappointing climax. Although I do believe the modern cinematic times are partially to blame for the hopeful denouement, because back in the 60's and early 70's unhappy endings were far more common. At least the ending of 'I Am Legend' is partially unhappy.You wouldn't have said so after his previous achievement in direction 'Constantine', but 'I Am Legend' certainly proves that Francis Lawrence disposes of a talented filmmaker's visions and a great eye for detail. The film is nightmarish yet beautiful to observe, with weeds and flowers growing back through the asphalted streets, billboards and advertisement signs that haven't been changed in more than three years, car wrecks and buildings that slowly decaying in the streets and the last man on earth smashing against golf balls from the wings of a military jet. 'I Am Legend' is at times even almost hauntingly poetic and I'm pretty sure the now 81-year-old Richard Matheson will appreciate the latest interpretation of his brilliant work. We can only hope the next large-scaled Matheson project (a remake of that other classic Sci-Fi story entitled 'The Incredible Shrinking Man') will be as good as this.",8,9,19,23 December 2007
A Quiet Place," No one dared disturb the sound of silence
","If you glance at the current IMDb rating, or quickly browse through the user comments and external reviews, you can't but assume that 'A Quiet Place' must be the most brilliantly intense and original new horror movie of the past 10, 15 or perhaps even 20 years. I honestly don't know if the film deserves all the superlatives and standing ovations that it's receiving, but I'll easily admit that it's a very tense, absorbing and beautiful thriller with a couple of unforgettable moments of fright as well as emotion. The concept of 'A Quiet Place' is original and innovative. If you really want to be historically precise, you could maybe state that the idea is somewhat similar to 'Tremors' or inspired by 'Day of the Triffids', but in the contemporary era of loud and visual effects driven blockbusters, it's quite unique to stumble across a genre film that primarily thrives on silent suspense and atmosphere. Around 2020-2021, the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland with only a small number of survivors. It wasn't zombies or nuclear bombs that exterminated humanity this time, but instead a primitive alien monster race that cannot see, smell or sense. However, these creatures have an ultra-developed hearing capacity and relentlessly attach every sound or minor vibration they pick up. Judging by the old newspaper headings, it took quite a while before people realized they had to keep their mouths shut, and thus there aren't that many left. One family is still complete, though, largely because the oldest daughter is deaf-mute, and every member is fluent in sign language. Survival nevertheless remains challenging, even despite their remote farmhouse being equipped and prepared for every possible monster threat. They go through an immense tragedy together and face new ordeals as the mother is expecting another baby. How do you give birth without making a single sound? Being a veteran horror fanatic and advocate for the genre, I'm happy that 'A Quiet Place' is so popular and well-received. Good to see that people, especially younger audiences, can still be impressed with basic but solid craftsmanship. One thing that director/lead actor John Krasinski does terrifically well is engaging the viewer. Whilst watching, you will be just as quiet and focused as the protagonists, and you're even likely to give angry looks to fellow spectators opening a can of beer, chewing too loud on their potato chips or making any other random noise. Compliant with the oldest, but still most effective rules of the horror book, the monsters largely remain an unseen but omnipresent menace. Only during the extended and action-packed finale, they are fully shown, and I must add they look fantastic! Think of a crossover breed between the legendary beasts in 'Alien' and a cenobite from 'Hellraiser'.",8,3,6,3 October 2018
Dog Day Afternoon," It's OK to be Gay! It's not OK to rob banks, though
","'Dog Day Afternoon' definitely belongs in the category of: 'this must be based on a true story, otherwise it's completely implausible'. The idea of a failed and amateurishly executed bank heist turning into an absurd media-circus and a giant metaphor for overkill situations in recent American history, I can still believe. But the crazy revelation that the whole scheme was thought up because money was needed for the sex-change operation of the homosexual robber's lover, well that is so surreal and far-fetched that it simply has to be true! If any aspiring scriptwriter would present this type of idea to a random producer, he/she wouldn't receive a single penny for it. But you know what? The biggest accomplishment of writer Frank Pierson, director Sidney Lumet and – of course – the phenomenal actor Al Pacino – is that they managed to keep the essence of the story rather small and personal. All the socially relevant themes are downgraded to mere sub plots while the private story of Sonny is gradually put forward. He's intelligent but insecure, anxiety-ridden and utterly self-destructive. The way Al Pacino depicts him is righteously referred to as one of the most powerful and persuasive performances in the history of cinema. John Cazale gives away a nearly as impressive performance as Sal, the somewhat simple but loyal partner-in-crime, although obviously less expressive and energetic than Pacino.",8,0,2,3 October 2017
No Man's Land," You started this war!... No, YOU started this war!!
","First of all, I think it's a shame that this film isn't listed under its Slovenian title 'Nikogarsnja zemlja'. Anyway, what we have here is quite an impressive piece of work. Danis Tanovic wrote and directed a debut that easily is one of the best films since the new Millennium. Seemly without trying, Tanovic succeeds in bringing what so many other directors desperately attempt and fail: namely a satirical attack on the absurdity and uselessness of war! But without losing grip on the suspenseful and credible story, an that's an extra achievement. The story is simple but efficient and stuffed with little ingenious findings and subtle sarcasm. No Man's Land involves three soldiers  two Bosnians and one Serb  trapped in a trench between the two fronts. One of the Bosnians is wounded and lying on a mine that will explode and kill everybody in a range of 50 metres. While he carefully tries not to move an inch, the other two soldiers are bickering about what side actually began the war. There's a group of UN soldiers trying to help them but these people are constantly facing obstacles, intrusive press people and obnoxious superiors that prevent them from saving the trapped soldiers. Tanovic sense of clever dialogue and his courage to openly condemn the situation in his homeland make this one of the most admirable films of the last few decades. I'm really really glad that this No Man's Land won the Academy Award for best foreign language film over that dreadfully over-hyped 'Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain'. One of the best choices the Academy ever made!",7,78,155,10 October 2004
Back to the Future Part III," Think four-dimensionally!
","Seeing the surprise and originality factor had pretty much vanished entirely after the two first films, Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis were forced to come up with a slightly different approach for the finale of their hugely successful and ultimately entertaining time-traveling 'Back to the Future' trilogy. They masterfully succeeded in this by drastically altering the time setting and by shifting the main emphasis towards Christoper Lloyd's character Doc instead of Marty. Number three takes Marty back to the Wild West in 1885, where Doc has settled himself in a small village after the DeLorean's short circuit in 1955. Doc had instructed Marty to return to his own time and let him remain in 1885, but upon discovering Doc's tombstone indicating a premature death, Marty travels back in time after all. With the DeLorean damaged beyond repair, they now both find themselves stuck in the Wild West and their attempts to find a solution are subsequently interrupted by Biff Tannen's criminal ancestor Buford and by the Doc himself falling in love with the charming school teacher Clara Clayton. The change in tone almost leads to this third film having its very own and independent personality. Those who endlessly claim that part three is the weakest and least memorable entry of the trilogy probably didn't yet realize that the source of paradox-jokes and situational humor was as good as exhausted after two films already. This film contains a different type of comedy, as it actually qualifies as a respectful Spaghetti Western satire (Marty imitates everything he learned about the Wild West from watching Clint Eastwood films) and a highly likable romantic comedy. And then still the die-hard fans of parts one and two have no actual reason to complain, since most of the characters re-appear as their own ancestors (like Michael J. Fox in a double role as the first McFly who entered America, the aforementioned malignant Buford Tannen and even Mr. Strickland as a late 19th Century lawman). The eventual return to 1985 is enormously spectacular and exciting, with the DeLorean being put on rails and pushed by a locomotive in order to reach 88 miles per hour, and the director's interpretation and re-creation of the Western period is prototypic but irresistibly charming, with raunchy saloons, unhygienic cowboys spitting around everywhere, a town's festival (with live performance by ZZ Top!) and the cavalry chasing after Indians. We already knew Michael J. Fox and Christoper Lloyd were ideally cast as Marty and Doc, but now also Mary Steenburgen gives away a stellar performance as the cute teacher and love-interest. 'Back to the Future Part III' is a stupendous film and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!",8,2,2,2 January 2009
Children of Men," Sweet Child in Time . Will You See the Light?
","Various highly acclaimed and respected sources of criticism refer to 'Children of Men' as the absolute greatest Sci-Fi movie since 'Blade Runner'. I can't really disagree with that, since I never was a big supporter of this particular classic, but still 'Children of Men' isn't the unhinged new masterpiece everyone claims it to be. The grim atmosphere is great, the sets are greatly depressing, some details in the script are truly extraordinary, the abrupt plot twists are shocking and the acting performances are overall stunning. Yet, somehow, the wholesome simply doesn't feel as astounding and refreshingly original as it should. It's a good film, but in case you're familiar with obscure, often low-budgeted and apocalyptic themed B-movies of the late 70's/early 80's, Alfonso Cuarón's script has surprisingly little new stuff to offer you. Several of the main story lines in 'Children of Men', like the infertility of the human race or Britain being the last remaining place of civilization (although), are often just smaller footnotes in Sci-Fi flicks of the old days. The first 30 or so minutes of the film are the absolute greatest. Chaotic images of several of the largest and most prominent cities of the world burning down, fascist soldiers aggressively preventing immigrants from entering the UK and a  downright brilliant  sub plot about the last born human being bombarded to a media figure and he himself, 19 years old, not able to cope with the unwanted attention. The real plot kicks off when Theo Feron, a totally antipathetic loner, is requested  commanded actually  by his ex girlfriend to escort a very special girl to safety because she carries in her womb the fetus that could represent mankind's final little string of hope for survival. Their journey together is long, full of lethal obstacles and literally no one can be trusted. At least as far as I'm concerned, 'Children of Men' is definitely a showcase of style over substance. What distinguishes this film from the rest is Cuarón's extremely raw and uncompromising filming style. The cinematography is everything but fancy, with shaky camera movements and disturbing visuals, the characters are uncanny and behave utterly nihilistic and the action is merciless. Clive Owen, definitely one of the coolest and most talented breakthrough actors since the new Millennium, gives another stellar performance. Personally, I wouldn't rank this amongst the 250 greatest movies ever made, like the votes and ratings around here indicate, but it's certainly a film worth checking out for mature audiences.",7,1,6,10 April 2008
Garden State," Truly promising and ambitious indie-film
","Half depressed and reluctant to face his traumatizing past for the first time in nearly 10 years, Andrew Largeman returns to the New Jersey region where he grew up, and this to be present at his mother's funeral. It's destined to be a short trip, since there's absolutely nothing there for Andrew. He's still estranged from his father, his old friends assume he has a successful acting career going on and  worst of all  the parental house reminds him of the accident that crippled his mother. But, shortly after his arrival, he meets Samantha and her spirited persona finally brings some joy and hope in Andrew's lonely existence. For the first time ever, Andrew actually has a reason to return home permanently...but then he has to find total peace with himself, first. A simple movie about simple characters with simple values in their lives...we don't get to see many of these and even when there occasionally is an enthusiast director who's attempts to make a clever little movie like this, they're straightly condemned to video-hell because nowadays movie-goers exclusively pay to see wild car chases and giant explosions. Even though Zach Braff was one of the few debuting young directors who DID receive some recognition and praising reviews for his 'Garden State', a large majority of film fanatics still hasn't discovered it. And they all should, since it's heart-warming and identifiable tale, written and directed by someone who clearly loves and respects real cinema. It's highly praiseworthy how Braff finds an almost perfect balance between bittersweet melodrama and gallows humor! 'Garden State' is a drama with a rather serious substance and yet it never becomes feeble or pitiful. On the contrary, the script's subtle sense of humor and the beautiful characterizations resuscitates hope and happiness!Yes, 'Garden State' is a very good film and Zach Braff surely knows which way he's going in the movie business. But still we shouldn't acclaim him as a new and long-awaited prodigy just yet! Although very admirable, his film isn't entirely flawless and definitely not groundbreaking. The story lacks some truly brilliant elements (ingenious ideas  if only just two or three  is what really makes films like this terrific) and it's a shame that too much of the characters' troubles are blamed on drugs. To focus more on the genius aspects again: the soundtrack is excellent (containing a great Coldplay-song and a downright mesmerizing track by Simon and Garfunkel) and the acting of an entirely talented cast simple couldn't be better. Nathalie Portman is particularly impressive in portraying the sweetest female character ever shot on film. Zach Braff already damn well knows how create moody atmospheres and how to write solid dialogues! If he'll now just find a truly innovating premise, his next project will be a masterpiece without peer! *Note: This user comment is dedicated to the sweetest girl in the world; Cazzie. Believe me, she's really great in convincing people to SEE THIS FILM!",8,4,7,2 August 2005
The Nightmare Before Christmas," The biggest fun a movie can give you !!!
","I hate myself...This movie has been out since TEN years and I never bothered to watch it earlier. 'Totally not my style' I thought. Well, I've seldom been more wrong...This movie is everybody's style !!! I think I'll start watching it every year now on the 24th of december...( What can I say, I'm a traditional person :-D ) No seriously, I loved this movie. It gave me a warm feeling, plenty of laughs and a good old portion of sentiment. Heck, I even almost caught myself on singing along. I can assure you this means something !Actually, it's one of the few times the singing in a movie isn't annoying. Tim Burton's style is well presented in this story. Only he can tell a fairy-tale in such a macabre and morbid way. The atmosphere comes very close to that other masterpiece of his, Edward Scissorhands. The coorporation with Danny Elfman only makes the whole finished project more terrific.SPOILERS !!!!!!!!! The story is about Jack Skellington. The pumpkin-king of Halloween town. In this cute little world, a large amount of horrible creatures prepare the celebration of Halloween. After the annual holiday, Jack is a bit disappointed and takes a long walk. He ends up in Christmas town. This village is similar to Halloween town only they're responsible for the preparation of Christmas. Jack is so enthusiast about this that he wants to introduce this idea in Halloween town. Jack is set to replace 'Santa Claws' and he will ride out to give presents to the children on Christmas evening! END SPOILERS !!!!!!! The characters in this wonderful story are very memorable. The wicked Dr. Finklestein on top. He looks like an evil version of Duckman and he opens his metal skull to scratch his brains. Very funny ! The female he created, Sally, is adorable and she's the greatest tribute to 'The Bride of Frankenstein' I've ever seen. Many other great references to classic horror films and I always appreciate things like that. The Boogieman, the Mayor, the witch...all these characters deserve their share of credit but I think I'll just stop here and finish by saying that this movie is highly recommended. Favorite 'rewind'-scene: Jack tries to explain the concept of Christmas to rest of his town through a song. They don't see the whole point of it and wonder why this whole thing doesn't involve death or horror. Hilarious !!",9,9,13,2 October 2003
Mulholland Drive," Incomprehensible elegance
","Mulholland Dr. must be located somewhere on the 'lost highway' in the wide area of 'Twin Peaks'in other words; it's a pure David Lynch product and a film that will unquestionably divide audiences. Every time this genius (to some, at least) delivers a film, it immediately grows out the biggest cinematic event of the year and a topic of endless discussions. Seeing the rating on this site, it looks like many people consider this Lynch's best achievement in the weirdness field (The Elephant Man and The Straight Story not included), yet I don't agree with that. No doubt it's a mesmerizing film that haunts and moves you long after you finished watching it, though. On the surface, this is a tale handling about the stereotypical life in Hollywood. You've got the young and easily impressed actress who's hoping to build up a career (Noami Watts) and there also is a second storyline handling about a director (Justin Theroux) influenced and threatened by the mob in his casting choices. So basically, this is film-noir type of story but it's crystal clear that Lynch doesn't care much for the typical genre intrigues and focuses more on what's lying underneathlike the whole spectrum of human emotions. Oh heck, I can't explain it and neither can anyone else. But it works! Throughout the whole film, you're hypnotized by the elegance and mystery Mulholland Dr. radiates. The bizarre and eccentric characters fascinate you and the slow-paced camera-work creates an unmatched tension that'll make you jump more than once. And yet, something is lacking here. Although Lynch can't be blamed for it, as he intended this a pilot film for a new TV-series in Twin Peaks style. *** HUGE SPOILER *** after an hour and a half of careful observing and hunting for clues, the story falls into identities switching. This sort of leaves you behind with the unsatisfied feeling of déjà-vu as you recognize it from Lynch previous classic 'Lost Highway'. *** END SPOILER***. After ABC declined turning this into a TV-series it feels like Lynch rushed with adding twists and turns with a disappointing climax as a result. Despite these flaws, Mulholland Dr. still ranks as one of the greatest films since the new millennium with its unique eeriness and excellent cast. Naomi Watts is terrific as the tender and fragile young actress and Laura Harring is downright breathtaking. There's a near-perfect chemistry between the two leading ladies resulting in the most sensual erotic sequences of the last few decades. There also are minuscule supportive roles for class actors like Dan Hedaya and Robert Forster.",8,3,11,22 November 2004
Evil Dead," If it's gore that you want  then GORE you will get!
","Should I really state the obvious and begin my review with the confirmation that the remake can't hold a candle to the original 'The Evil Dead'? No of course not, but meanwhile I've done so anyways! That being said, even several days after watching this film, I still find it difficult to form a judgment. The unwritten but relentless rule: 'be wary of horror movies that put all sorts of praising quotes on the poster/DVD cover' once again proves itself to be very accurate and reliable. The poster image for 'Evil Dead' spawns a whole miscellany of glorifying words, but they are slightly exaggerated to say the least. It might be a decent and enjoyable splatter flick, but it certainly isn't 'astoundingly awesome', it certainly did not 'blew me away' and it most definitely isn't a 'near-perfect horror experience'. What is it, then? It's another redundant remake of a true genre milestone that didn't require a remake, but if you choose to watch it anyway, you'll be served an exhilarating and entertaining flick chock-full of blood, vulgarities and nastiness. In case you're solely looking for a gory good time you can hardly go wrong with this modernized version. Then again, Sam Raimi's landmark is over 30 years old and STILL qualifies as one of the goriest movies of all times The set-up is similar but sillier. Instead of sending her to a professional rehabilitation clinic, three idiots drag their friend to a remote cabin in the woods to help her get rid of her drug addiction. While she's going nuts and terrorizes two of her idiot friends (including her estranged brother), the third and biggest idiots stumbles upon the Necronomicon in the cellar and unknowingly awakens ancient demonic forces. The junkie girl is the first one to become possessed, while she attempts to flee from the cabin, but her dumb friend remain convinced her behavior is caused by withdrawal symptoms. Why, of course! All former junkies pour boiling water over their face and cut their tongues in half with a knife, don't they? Furthermore there isn't much coherence or substance in the plot and the protagonist characters are superficial and bland. The one and only aspects to appreciate here are the special effects and make-up. It literally rains blood and the nasty stuff that overcomes the victims is brutal and gruesome. Director Fede Alvarez only managed to create a creepy atmosphere and mysteriousness during the opening sequence ('I will swallow your soul, Daddy!'), but after that he goes straight for goo and guts.",5,0,4,9 October 2013
The Evil Dead," A movie everyone should respect !
","A few nights ago, a couple of friends and myself watched The Evil Dead again. It was like the 68th viewing for me ( I think...lost count somewhere around 50) but it still only means one thing to me: PARTY !! Many feeling can occur when watching this delicious masterpiece by Sam Raimi. You can either adore it, be frightened by it or be disgusted by it. But it always leaves a big impression on you and I can't imagine anyone would hate it. And there is ONE feeling that everyone should have towards this movie...RESPECT ! Mostly respect regarding the achievement of Sam Raimi. This guy was 21 years old when he made this film and that's impressive to say the least. I'm around that age at the moment and I sure as hell haven't pulled it off yet...I strongly doubt I ever will, actually. No, when you're able to come up with such an original and dared idea for a horror film, you belong to the greatest minds in the film industry. Sam Raimi did it and his further career only confirmed his status of being a genius with every single movie he directed afterwards. Tons of respect towards Bruce Campbell as well. Sure his performance in this movie is far from great, but at the time, he did it because of his friendship with Sam Raimi. And because The Evil Dead became a big hit, his career was launched too and he certainly grew as an actor. Bruce Campbell is now in the favorite actor-list of many B-movie fans...And I'm one of them.Then there's Tom Sullivan...responsible for the make-up. What a fine job he did. The Evil Dead gave a whole new meaning to the word 'gore' and we have this man to thank for that. Most nowadays horror films still can't live up to the standard of Evil Dead...not even close. The plot of this film is as simple as can be...but it works. Five friends drive to a small cabin in the woods to spend a small vacation. They find a tape recorder with a message...Out of curiosity, they play it and pure evil is rised in the woods. One by one, they become possessed and turn into horrible demons who try to kill those who're still alive...That's it !!! And that's all there is needed to create a fun and very original horror movie. The same story already came out in 1978 as a short film called 'Within the Woods'. It was meant to fund money for this film and it's great B-movie fun as well. If you're a big fan of The Evil Dead trilogy, it's certainly worth searching for.Anno 2003, Sam Raimi has grown out to one of Hollywood's favorite directors. He became immortal in the eyes of the big budget audience with his movie Spiderman. The sequel of that one is in production while I write this. I'm sure it will be as decent as the first Spiderman was, but I'd still prefer to see Evil Dead 4 coming from the brain of Sam Raimi.A fun trivia element to finish this review with : If you're watching the end credits of the Evil Dead, you'll see Joel Coen is credited as Assistent Editor. Coen now is a famous director as well and may be considered as the best director alive. Back in 1981, he and Sam Raimi were close friends and even shared a studio when they were in collage. Joel Coen made his debut in 1984 with Blood Simple. One of the best cult movies ever made...Join us....",10,168,235,10 September 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," This was definitely worth 6 years of waiting!
","Quentin Tarantino took his time to come with a follow-up for his 1997 Jackie Brown, but the patience of his fans is widely rewarded with this film! Kill Bill is, without any doubt, the coolest film I've seen in a long, long time. It's more than just a film; it's a truly refreshing experience and an almost complete encyclopedia for cinema buffs to admire. How can you tell a dreadful, déjà-vu tale of revenge and still look innovating and original? Only QT knows the answer to this He saw the change to extend a seemly repetitive plot (a woman awakes after a 4 year coma and avenges herself) with loads of tributes to `dead' film-genres, such as Martial Arts-movies, exploitation and Spaghetti-westerns. The results of this are absolutely amazing and Kill Bill is a film to watch over and over again, without EVER growing tired off. On the contraryit'll only get better with repeated viewings. The characters are typically Tarantino, which means delightfully eccentric and criminally insane. The main characters are the very ingenious `Deadly Viper Assassination Squad', led by Bill who's given image to by David Carradine! He's a 70's Kung-Fu legend and Tarantino more or less did the same for him as he did for John Travolta and Pam Grier. Some of the side-characters are highly memorable as well. Gogo, for example! She's a 17-year-old schoolgirl who makes up in madness what she lacks in age. Kill Bill contains less memorable dialogues than previous QT films, but this is widely made up by an overload of terrifically over-the-top violence. The absolute highlights to this being a grotesque finale and a brilliant Manga-tribute. I simply can't give enough praise to this film. If you like cinema and all of its history, you'll love Kill Bill and that's all there is to it. Every tiny detailed aspect about this movie is worth mentioning. From Daryl Hannah's eye lap with a little red cross on it to the extravagant Pussy Mobiel.  And than I haven't even talked about the brilliant soundtrack!!",9,1,7,22 April 2004
Saw II," I saw what you sawed last summer
","James Wan's sleeper-hit 'Saw' is one of the best and most memorable horror achievements of the last fifteen year, simply because it finally dared to shock and/or upset audiences again! No politically correct or goody-goody teenage horror in which girls are screaming and running while their breasts nearly burst out of the too-tight tops. No, even though far from flawless, 'Saw' was a creative and full-blooded horror film and thus a sequel was inevitable...and the sooner the better, according to Hollywood rules. It's only normal that the surprise and shock effects of the first have entirely vanished, but you're aware of that (or at least you should be) before watching it, so expectations are automatically set a little lower. Personally, I assumed that every true horror fan would agree this sequel is not a patch on the 2004 original but, and to my amazement, a lot of people seem to prefer it! Granted, the acting performances are better (though not that much...) and it is true that new writer/director Darren Lynn Bousman attempts to bring more depth and background to the characters. But more background also means more chance to create plot holes and confusion, and regretfully that is what happens here most. The opening sequence of 'Saw 2' is still very powerful and it easily could have come straight out of the first. After the credits, however, it goes downhill as fatigue copper Eric Matthews is challenged to a deadly game by the notorious Jigsaw-killer. The presumed sadist-killer turns out an old and pathetic cancer patient who can't stand it when people waste their lives aimlessly, while he has still so many dreams but can't fulfill them because of his disease. Apparently many fans liked this revelation. I sure didn't. Anyway, Jigsaw  or John Cremer, as he prefers to be called  kidnapped a whole lot of petty criminals and locked them all up in a nasty old house filled with traps. Among them also, is detective Matthews teenage son Daniel. Together, they have to look for clues that'll help them escape the house before the deadly nerves gas, which is spread around all the rooms, kills them first. Basically, 'Saw 2' is an expansion of the first film, only with a whole group of people instead of just two and a police officer who's more involved with the victims. The rest is pretty much identical and thus very repetitive. The murders also are a lot less imaginative and disturbing and I only counted ONE genuine shock-moment...which involved a pit and large amount of eerie syringes. All the aspects like set pieces, camera-work and musical score are good but  again  they're largely copied from the first movie and thus not worth praising. 'Saw 2' is a generally endurable sequel that enthusiast genre fans won't mind checking out, but don't expect another mesmerizing horror experience. As the tagline implies, there IS blood!...Oh Yes, there's blood, alright, but not much else.",4,10,20,3 January 2006
From Dusk Till Dawn," Lots of bangs and lots of fangs!
","It was only during my fifteenth – or so – viewing of 'From Dusk till Dawn' that I realized that I've never written a user comment for this film. Now that's a quick win! Along with all the other movies Quentin Tarantino was ever involved in, I love every repeated viewing of this film and I say all the characters' lines simultaneously with them. Even now, nearly 20 years after its first release, it still qualifies as one of the most successful crossbreeds between action/thriller and my beloved horror genre, and the film still stands proud and solid thanks to the fast-paced script, the fabulous dialogs, the terrific acting performances and – of course – the excessive use of gore and bloodshed! 'From Dusk till Dawn' starts out as a wild gangster/chase movie, with George Clooney (back when he was still desperately trying to get rid of his goody- two-shoes 'ER' reputation) and QT himself as the violent and unhinged Gecko brothers on the run for State Troopers, Texas Rangers and all other various sorts of authorities. They hijack former preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his teenage daughter and adopted son, who're road-tripping in their motorhome in order to process the loss of their wife and mother. Hidden inside the motorhome Seth and Ritchie Gecko cross the Mexican border and immediately head towards an exclusive bar called the Titty Twister. The film then halfway transforms, totally unexpectedly and unpredictable (at least the first time), into an outrageous splatter flick as it turns out that the staff and regular customers of this particular bar turn out to be vampires feeding on passing truckers and bikers. This may sound stupid and far-fetched, but in Tarantino's script it works wonderfully well and the battle between fugitive gangsters and wicked bloodsuckers is spectacular as well as funny and even suspenseful. The film is chock-full of references towards classic horror films, and particularly vampire classics obviously, and stars a handful of nearly-forgotten genre icons in small supportive roles. There's a lovely little role for Blaxploitation hero Fred Williamson, as a tough vampire killer, and a (sadly too short) cameo appearance by John Saxon. Make-up genius Tom Savino clearly also terrifically enjoyed himself as a dressed in leather biker by the nickname Sex Machine. The direction is in the hands of Tarantino's equally gifted pal Robert Rodriguez, who also invited his buddies Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo and Salma Hayek. The latter's sensual dance on top of the bar tables, just prior to hell breaking loose, is definitely also one of the highlights of the film. 'From Dusk till Dawn' is highly recommended entertainment that I'll undoubtedly watch countless times more. The sequels, on the other hand, suck like washed up vampire grannies.",8,0,1,11 December 2014
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Another magical Tim Burton trip!
","Roald Dahl's exhilarating children's novella is brought back to life by the best possible team imaginable! If there's anyone out there in cinema land capable of re-telling Dahl's colorful  yet macabre  story, it has got to be director Tim Burton (with his unique ability to create dark, fairy-tale like atmospheres), class actor Johnny Depp (not one character is too eccentric for himnot even Willy Wonka) and music-maestro Danny Elfman (whose typical style gives an extra magical touch to every film). With these three icons of nowadays cinema involved, the new adaptation of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' was bound to be an enormous success and definitely one of the greatest movies of the year 2005. Well, the movie didn't turn out as amazing as I hoped, but still it's a very beautiful and occasionally heart-warming experience with excellent set pieces and another highly memorable role for Depp. It's very likely that you've read the best-selling book or saw the earlier film version (starring Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka) but in case you're from another planet: Charlie Bucket, the titular character, is one of five lucky children who wins a grand tour in Willy Wonka's world famous chocolate factory. Wonka is a bit of a loner who normally never grants anyone access to his factory because there were too many competitors in the past who were out to steal his recipes. Charlie and the others enter a magical world where chocolate and other types of candy are made in the most bizarre waysand by the most bizarre kind of factory workers. The always-amazing Johnny Depp is very aware of the fact he's the star and tout of this production and he clearly is in a great shape again. His performance of Willy Wonka is very cheerful and, just as it was the case in Pirates of the Caribbean, you gladly allow him to go over the top. The young Freddie Highmore is really good as well in portraying Charlie, a boy with a limited imagination but a heart of pure gold. The screenplay contains some terrific dialogues and the (blackly tinted) humor is well spread over the whole film.And yetTim Burton and C° slightly disappointed me during some moments in the film. The many flashback (for example revolving on Wonka's supposedly traumatizing childhood) are too extended and actually quite redundant. Also, some of the character drawings are definitely underdeveloped, like Grandpa Joe for example, whom we only get to know superficially. Biggest letdown of all was the 'Oompa Loompas'-tribe. These little people fail to convince and especially their morality-songs are overlong and pointless. Compared to the first cinematic version of the book, released in 1971, I personally find Burton's film slightly weaker. Sure the older film had those very annoying songs and Johnny Depp simply crushes the memory of Gene Wilder but yet the wholesome was more captivating and the pivot sequences in the 1971 version (like the boat-ride and Oompa-Loompa life-lessons) were a lot more sinister. And if there's one term that fully describes Roald Dahl's oeuvre, it is 'sinister'.",7,15,26,1 August 2005
The Dark Knight," Dark... Darker...Darkest... The Dark Knight.
","It's certainly no exaggeration to claim Heath Ledger entirely owns this film. He clearly lived for his role of The Joker, most likely died for it too, and he's undeniably the sole reason why 'The Dark Knight' is currently considered to be one of the greatest movies ever made and even topping this website's very own top 250 ranking. But Heath Ledger deserves every single word of praise and honor that is being written about him. Ledger's passing irrevocably gives an extra and deeply tragic dimension to the new Batman movie, but even if the actor would still be alive today he would be the film's main attraction. With his performance as The Joker  a brilliant psychopath without cause or motives  Ledger exactly embodies what the ultimately relentless cinematic villain looks and acts like. Right from his first appearance on screen, when he illustrates an imaginative yet highly disturbing magic trick involving a pencil, Heath Legder already surpasses the performances of everyone who ever depicted the character of the Joker in the past and, yes, this even includes the almighty Jack Nicholson. The 'new' Joker looks menacing, talks menacing, behaves menacing and  most unsettling of all  his vile acts are completely impulsive and unpredictable. The Joker's facial make-up looks grimmer than the expressionist paintings by Edvard Munch, the morbid anecdotes he narrates about his past will give you cold shivers and even his continuous smacking of the lips is downright petrifying. It is, simply put, one of the greatest and most mesmerizing performances ever given. Period.Of course, given the brilliance of Ledger's performance and the tragic event of his death before the film's release date, you sometimes can't escape the impression that the whole production relies and revolves entirely on him, and this shouldn't be the case with such as prestigious and eminent film like 'The Dark Knight'. The storyline is basically very thin and most of the time it feels as if Batman himself is actually just a supportive character in the giant Joker and Harvey Dent (stellar performance by Aaron Eckhart) two-men show. Christian Bale's performance is terrific as always, but the his opponents  whether they are evil like the Joker or in love as well with Rachel Dawes like Harvey Dent - simply appear to be more interesting than Bruce Wayne and even Batman himself. The screenplay isn't impeccable and generally speaking 'The Dark Knight' definitely isn't the number one greatest movie ever made, but it's undoubtedly a marvelous film and slightly superior than the predecessor 'Batman Begins'. This first sequel is much more sinister, with a couple of shocking revelations and unexpected twists. I still miss the typically Tim Burtonesque depiction of Gotham City, but Christopher Nolan does realize more and more that Batman is a tormented figure and his story takes place in a depressing and pauperized city. The stunts and special effects are very spectacular and impressive, and particularly because the use of digital effects is kept reasonably low. Very much recommended, but of course you were already planning to watch it, anyway.",8,6,21,3 August 2008
Taken," As adrenalin-rushing as it gets
","I watched 'Taken' last night and, even though nearly 20 hours have passed since then, my blood is still pumping to my heart at a vastly increased speed! That's how exciting and adrenalin-rushing this brand new and brilliant French/American co-production is. Courtesy of the extremely gifted writers Luc Besson ('Leon', 'The Fifth Element') and Robert Mark Kramen ('The Transporter', 'The Karate Kid'), this is easily the most spectacular and non-stop exhilarating movie of the past five years or so; even surpassing the high quality and intensity level of the Bourne trilogy, the newest Die Hard sequel and all movies starring Jason Statham. The concept of 'Taken' covers the derivative formula of a rudimentary kidnapping movie, but what truly matters here is the unceasing fast-paced violence and the testosterone-packed performance of Liam Neeson. He stars as a retired spy for the US government who desperately tries to get in touch again with his estranged and heavily spoiled teenage daughter. When the girl and a friend travel to Paris against Bryan's will, they promptly become abducted by an Albanian network of drugs and network. Bryan has only 96 hours to save his girl, but barely a clue where or how to start his investigation. Luckily enough, Bryan is a trained fighting specialist with connections all over the world. 'Taken' is somewhat similar to Roman Polanski's late 80's thriller 'Frantic' story and setting-wise, but the speed and stunts are typically Luc Besson. Obviously this isn't the most plausible movie ever made, but I don't even think you're even supposed to believe half of what you see, just sit back and enjoy the ride. 'Taken' is a smörgåsbord of virulent car chases, fist-fights, martial arts, explosions, sweet torturing methods and ultra-revolting bad guys. Fantastic stuff.",9,3,6,7 June 2009
The Mummy Returns," Do not watch if you're older than 15
","The first Stephen Sommers mummy-movie, released in 1999, already was a lousy and overly boisterous film that focused on the visual eye-candy rather than to re-tell the classic Imothep-tale properly. Still, it had its compelling moments and enough humor to put the whole production into perspective. Even the more experienced horror fan, who seeks atmosphere instead of excitement, could find a bit of joy in 'The Mummy'. This rapidly finished sequel, however, fully aims itself at (pre-) teen audiences who never in their lives saw a good movie and waste their days with playing video games! The script is a mess, revolving on the resurrection of Imothep (again) and the coming of a new Egyptian bad-boy, namely 'The Scorpion King'. Rick and Evelyn O'Connor (the heroes of the first) as well as Imothep intend to destroy 'The Scorpion King', but for different purposes. The mean mummy wants to take of command of Scorpion's army and wipe out the world whereas the archaeologists-couple tries to prevent this. There's a giant amount of totally redundant sequences and it looks like they were only added to show good the makers are with computer-engineered special effects. Okay, we got it...tell a story instead! Every dead end or illogical aspect in the script is resolved with another attention-distracting visual trick and  after a while  it looks like the writers aren't even trying to be ingenious anymore. The acting is really bad with Fraser and Weisz both thinking about their paychecks instead of their lines and the introduction of cinema's most annoying child-actor in history: Freddie Boath. He's an 8-year-old brat who supposedly has more archaeologist-knowledge than an army of university professors. John Hannah also walks around the sets for no reason. He had a few funny one-liners and grimaces in the first film, but his part here is pretty much pointless. For some incomprehensible reason, this movie is pretty loved among IMDb-members (judging by the ratings and user comments) but I can't think of any positive (or even redeeming) comments in favor of it. I'm sorry",1,6,15,21 June 2005
Drag Me to Hell," 'The Evil Dead' it ain't, but damn fine horror nevertheless!
","I actually don't even know why I'm referring to 'The Evil Dead' in the subject line of this user-comment. Presumably because, like the majority of die-hard horror fanatics, I was really looking forward to director Sam Raimi's return to the genre that promptly made him immortal back in 1981. 'The Evil Dead' is a timeless masterpiece and a milestone that helped determining the fundamentals of an entire genre. Even though nobody expected 'Drag Me to Hell' to be on the same dazzling quality level as 'The Evil Dead', it's nonetheless a refreshment to see Raimi directing a good old-fashioned grueling movie that doesn't feature any comic book superheroes in tight spider maillots, massive 200 million dollar budgets or hi-tech spectacular stunts. 'Drag Me To Hell' has a fairly simplistic plot and even regularly reverts back to some of the most ancient clichés of the horror genre, but at least the excitement is non-stop and fast-paced with a handful of authentic jump-moments. The story is a bit of a mixture between Stephen King's 'Thinner' and the legendary classic 'The Exorcist'. Over- ambitious bank employee Christine Brown becomes the victim of a terrible curse when she refuses to extend the loan of an ageing gypsy woman and subsequently puts her to shame in public. The evil-eyed gypsy wench Sylvia Ganush (glorious role for TV-actress Lorna Raver) possesses Christine with the spirit of Lamia; a malignant and insurmountable goat- lord demon that demands animal sacrifices and can't even be controlled during professionally staged exorcism sessions. Experienced horror buffs know that a plot description like this guarantees a giant amount of sinister séances, magic talismans and hysterically rampaging witches. Especially the first half hour and the climax of 'Drag Me To Hell' are downright fantastic and genuine 'oldskool' horror material. The middle section is more or less familiar territory, with derivative twists and irrelevant sub plots, but Sam Raimi nevertheless professionally sustains the moody atmosphere and even gradually builds up towards the stupendous finale. Obviously I can't reveal anything about the ending, but I assure it's the best frikkin' climax I saw in cinemas in decades! The make-up and sound effects are sublimely unsettling without ever becoming overly tasteless or shocking, and the acting performances are really satisfying. Alison Lohman is very good as the tormented protagonist – not at all hysterical or irritating like I initially feared – and she received adequate support from Justin Long, David Paymer and the aforementioned Lorna Raver. The only thing missing here is a cameo from ultra-cool dude and regular Sam Raimi buddy Bruce Campbell, but according to the trivia section he got in conflict with other filming responsibilities, so even that's forgiven.",7,3,9,20 July 2009
Saw," A new hope for the horror genre...
","Despite a few obvious flaws and a couple of understandable logic-errors, James Wan's debut 'Saw' definitely is one of the best horror projects of the last fifteen years. It finally is a film that dares to shock again! Most recent horror films politely request whether it's okay or not to scare you now, while 'Saw'  much like cult hits from the 60's and 70's  just grab you by the throat and doesn't let go before the end credits start to role. That's what this genre is all about! It's not about how 100% waterproof the script is or how Oscar-worthy the acting is....we need shocks, bitterness and madness! Wan doesn't waste any time, as the story begins with two men waking up in a filthy old restroom, chained to the wall and separated by and corpse holding a gun. Still unaware of where they are and what they did to deserve this, Adam (a photographer) and Lawrence (an adulterous surgeon) are given the order to survive this situation by killing the other, using the attributes hidden somewhere in the room. It soon becomes clear that they were captured by the notorious 'Jigsaw' killer...an extremely violent but intelligent serial murderer whose identity is still a mystery to the police and whose only motive and grudge seems to go out to people who're ungrateful to be alive. Wan and co-writer Whannel did their best to stuff the plot with so many twists and turns that you eventually stop to guess along in the killer's identity but the climax is overall satisfying and ingenious enough to be praiseworthy. The very best aspects, however, are the very imaginative 'games' that the killer has thought up for his/her victims! These sequences (mostly shown through flashbacks) are utterly demented, grim and most certainly not meant for the eyes of the squeamish! I wanted more of them, actually...Truly disturbing also is the use of eerie scenery (masks, dark set pieces, torture machines) and sound effects. The gore is not overwhelming  thank God  but several sequences are quite repulsive and there even are a couple of authentic 'jump' sequences. It's true that the acting, of nearly the entire cast, is abominable and at times even downright irritating. Maybe it's because all the washed up actors and actresses (there are quite a few 'departed glory' stars here: Cary Elwes, Dany Glover, Monica Potter, Dina Meyer...) are just disappointed in their careers or maybe the young director Wan still lacks the talent to guide his cast into the right performances. I sure didn't allow the acting to ruin the rest of the film for me. When you watch horror a lot, you'll quickly learn that atrocious acting can't be too much of an obstacle. This is probably a film that will raise even more questions and unravel more mistakes when you watch it the second time around, but at least the first viewing is impressive and ensuring horror buffs that they're beloved genre is not yet dead and buried.",7,1,7,13 March 2005
Mama," Mama! I don't want to die I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all!
","Typical movies like 'Mama', by which I mean PG-13 ghost movies with computerized shock-effects, definitely aren't my thing but I will admit straight away that I cherish some respect and appreciation for this particular movie. 'Mama' is fundamentally a very clichéd and ordinary flick about a fiendish supernatural entity, but writer/director Andrés Muschietti single-handedly brings it to a higher level thanks to processing realistic main characters and socially relevant themes into his screenplay. I was particularly impressed by the opening sequences that so unscrupulously deal with family tragedy. A clearly desperate middle-aged father reportedly killed three people already, including his ex-wife, and drags his two young daughters to a secluded cabin in the woods where he sees no other alternative than to kill them and himself as well. We regretfully see a lot of tragic news facts like this one on TV, but for some reason they still remain taboo in movie scenarios. The supernatural aspect kicks in when the father is prevented to fulfill his vile act of desperation by a ghostly long black-haired entity. The plot then subsequently introduces two other identifiable main characters, namely the girls' uncle Lucas who's overpowered by feelings of guilt and responsibility and his rock artist girlfriend Annabel who supports her man but is actually reluctant to take the girls into custody. Annabel even becomes the lead guardian when Lucas gets severely injured in a bizarrely inflicted accident. The rest of the film is familiar ghost-movie stuff, meaning predictable plot-twists, a too large portion of sentiment and an avalanche of textbook 'boo!' situations. For you see, throughout a long 5 year period, the poor little sisters survived in that little cabin in the woods because they were being looked after by the restless spirit of a mother who got murdered in that same location many years ago. When the uncle finds and 'rescues' the estranged girls, the Mama-ghost turns malevolent and follows them to the civilized world. The Mama figure, with its long weaving dark hair and bizarrely produced sounds, is very reminiscent to the ghosts introduced in popular Japanese blockbusters, like 'Ringu' and 'Ju-On: The Grudge', and the film makes the typical mistake of showing it too much and too frequently. In this type of scary flicks, the less you see of the evil, the more menacing it is. Jessica Chastain gives a stellar performance and a handful of scenes are definitely unsettling. Andrés Muschietti initially released 'Mama' as a short film, but thanks to the interest of certain influential producers like Guillermo Del Toro, it became a large-budgeted and internationally acclaimed long-feature horror hit as well. I read that his next project will be an upcoming remake of 'It' What is it with promising young directors immediately blocking their creativity by making redundant remakes?!?",6,1,2,15 October 2015
The Last Samurai," Routine heroic stuff...Same old stuff, different setting
","I usually get a stomach ache of these overbudgetted and overhyped heroic epics. They often are too loud, too long and especially way too fake. Big budget-stuff with a bunch of unnecessary moral and side plots. The Last Samurai is no exception to this. It's a very pretty decorated, but empty package. Like Braveheart...like Gladiator...only this time is set in the late 18th century Japan. These movies certainly are worth wating if you enjoy breath-taking locations and terrific sound and visual effects. These aspects are ALWAYS superior to the story. The history lesson it tries to tell is loosely based on true events but to please and gain a huge audience, they're throwing in the life story of a fed up American Captain ( Tom Cruise ), a forced romance and a lot of pathetic family values and 'codes of loyalty'. I have to reckon that the battle sequences in The Last Samurai are exiting, though. There's a good amount of blood shed and the chopped off limbs are flying from one side of the screen to the other. That's the least thing you expect from an historical epic, no? It's a real shame that the story which connects these battles is so lame. What I really don't understand is that Cruise is tipped as an important Oscar candidate this year, 2003?!? I thought that he overacted terribly (like he usually does) and that his performance was nowhere near interesting. The British comedian Billy Connely does a much better job, I think. Too bad his character dies really early...The largest part of the characters in The Last Samurai are uninspired and not very believable or convincing. In general, the entire production lacks a few aspects to become as successful as Braveheart or other epics, but it certainly fits into the same category. Well made but mainstream stuff intended to make profit The occasional film fan loves this, but the more developed cinema freak is far from impressed.",5,4,9,24 January 2004
Sinister," America's Creepiest Home Videos
","'Sinister' has been waiting in my watch queue for quite a while now, but for a variety of reasons I always postponed my viewing. On one hand I had really high hopes that the film would be worthwhile, since I read several praising reviews from people, or in magazines and on websites, that I usually find very reliable and with tastes similar to mine. But on the other hand this still is a primarily mainstream film that almost purely exists of clichés and tries a little too desperately to obtain a passable rating R. So what's the final verdict? 'Sinister' honestly is one of the better and scarier horror films of the last 10 to 15 years, but that's almost solely thanks to the genuinely disturbing and nightmarish super-8 home movies that are integrally shown throughout the movie. As stated already, the plot as well as the setting and the character drawings are derivative and clichéd. Ellison Oswalt is a true-crime writer, but it's been more than a decade since he scored the huge bestseller hit 'Kentucky Blood'. In his exaggeratedly fanatic search to surpass that success, he moves with his family into a house where – unbeknown to his wife and children – a horrible and still unsolved tragedy took place. So far, it's all routine and familiar stuff The local sheriff tries to chase them away, Oswalt's marriage is under a lot of pressure because of his professional stress and drinking problem and his children suffer from nightmares in their new surroundings. But then our writer stumbles upon a box full of uncanny old-fashioned super-8 home videos in the attic and THEY undeniably form the eminence of 'Sinister'. Every self-respecting horror fanatic will consider these videos little masterpieces in their own right: shocking, morbid, raw and yet impossible to turn away from. The videos depict the gruesome murder of the family in whose house Oswalt is now living with his family, but also the sick murders of several other once happy families all over the United States. By the time that Oswalt discovers the truth of who (or what) is behind these vile massacres and who filmed them, the fate of his own family is already sealed Ethan Hawke does a terrific and mature job carrying the film, Scott Derrickson's direction is more than competent and the ice cold & spooky soundtrack contributes a lot to the tension and atmosphere as well. But still, like I assume every horror fan with me, I personally just kept looking forward to the each showing of the next super-8 video and didn't care all that much about the supernatural explanation connecting them. These little short films ought to be released separately on DVD, as far as I'm concerned, as every single one of them is a parental nightmare captured on film. Loving family scenes degenerate into harrowing killings, now that is horror! IF only the script didn't revert to ancient mythologies to provide clarification and IF only the producers would have had the guts to make the murders explicit and brutal instead of suggestive, well than 'Sinister' would have been the greatest genre hit of the new millennium. If only",6,1,2,8 January 2017
The Fly," The terrifying 'Brudlefly-project'!
","Truly great – but very nasty – update of the classic 1958 sci-fi film with both Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis in the roles of their lives. Technically, this is a remake, but with a genius like David Cronenberg in the director's chair, it's obvious that this isn't anything like the uninspired and irritating remakes that are being released nowadays ('The Amityville Horror', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'). Cronenberg's interpretation of this ultimate terror-tale differs greatly from the original. In fact, the only resemblance is the basic premise of a fusion between an obsessive scientist and an ordinary housefly. Goldblum is terrifically cast as the brilliant, but slightly confused mastermind Seth Brudle, whose lifework are 'telepods'; funny looking machines capable of transmitting matter through space. Journalist Davis, with whom he has a romantic adventure, closely observes the progress of his work but when he teapot's himself through space, the catastrophe happens. Mentally as well as physically, Brudle undergoes a horrible transformation into a fly and it cannot be stopped. 'The Fly' is a very devastating film. Powerful enough, but not exactly pleasant to look at. Like only the greatest directors can pull this off, Cronenberg overwhelms the audience with a sublime mixture drama, misery and repulsiveness. You feel as helpless as the characters themselves and you painfully wait for the unhappy ending to come! The screenplay is filled with genuine metaphors and the romance between Goldblum and Davis is beautifully illustrated. The special effects, mainly created by Chris Walas (who went on directing the 1989-sequel) are definitely still staggering and they don't look the least bit dated by today's standards.",9,102,134,27 May 2005
From Hell," The Grapes of DEATH!
","This isn't the first movie about the notorious late 19th century serial killer Jack The Ripper and it sure as 'hell' won't be the last. 'From Hell' is, however, the most budgeted one of the bunch and also the first (at least, by my knowledge) that actually attempts severely to reveal the possible identity of Jackie-boy and the motivations behind his gruesome killings. The screenplay for this film was adapted from authentic police reports from that period, and the prostitute-murders are truthful reconstructions, based on original illustrations and drawings. This realism results in a very compelling, powerful and often shocking first half hour. The prostitutes (or 'unfortunate women' as they are referred to) of the London Whitechapel-quarter are approached by a sophisticated gentleman in a black coach, who offers them drapes and a tempting amount of money. Shortly after, their murdered bodies are found severely mutilated. They also seem to be missing organs that were removed surgically, which raises the suspicion that the killer might very well be a man of high standing. Police inspector (and full-time opium-addict) Abberline devotedly investigates the case and stumbles on eminent organizations that surely don't want to be linked with the murders. Director-duo Albert and Allen Hughes somewhat lose their grip on the complex story after the third murder and the film's climax is sorely disappointing. The most fascinating thing about the entire production unquestionably is the breathtaking Victorian setting! The London of 1888 is terrifically illustrated, with its foggy streets; corrupt police system and enormous differences in social class. Much more than a horror portrait, 'From Hell' is a raw ghetto-drama about survival! This isn't surprising, since the directors previously made the minor classics 'Menace II Society' and 'Dead Presidents' that are all about social conflicts. Johnny Depp is terrific as usual, Heather Graham makes your heart melt and the supportive cast exists of multi-talented British actors such as Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings), Jason Flemying (Snatch) and Robbie Coltrane (Mona Lisa).

Don't Breathe," In the home of the blind, the blind is still the king!
","In many of the reviews, user-comments and movie blog discussions that I encountered recently, 'Don't Breathe' is referred to as one of the most intense, horrifying and genuinely shocking horror/thrillers of the past 10-15 years Is it now? Is it really, or are we simply not seeing enough intense and genuinely shocking thrillers lately? Because, after all, 'Don't Breathe' is only a very simplistic and derivative story with stereotypical lead characters, highly questionable plot twists and only a handful of semi-decent jump scenes that you can feel coming well in advance. There's a reasonably uncanny and grim atmosphere throughout, and Stephen Lang puts down a solid anti-hero performance, but aside from that 'Don't Breathe' is a very routine and forgettable heist-gone-wrong thriller. Fede Alvarez did a fairly respectable job remaking the almighty horror classic 'The Evil Dead', and apparently Sam Raimi thought so too, as he appears on the credits as executive producer for Alvarez' newest and very own film baby. Three amateur teen burglars from the lower Detroit (or was it Chicago?) social middle- class think they have stumbled on the opportunity of a lifetime. They will break into the home of a former Gulf War veteran who allegedly stores a large sum of money from when his only daughter got killed in a road accident. It's guaranteed to be a piece of cake, since the veteran is the sole remaining resident in a pauperized housing area and, moreover, he turns out to be as blind as a bat! Of course it quickly becomes abundantly clear that they made a big mistake, for starters because our veteran owns a vicious Rottweiler dog (that is not blind) and, secondly, he isn't just a helpless disabled person but a genuinely relentless psychopath. The three teen burglars are hopelessly clichéd and cardboard characters. The self-acclaimed leader is tough but typically ruthless and dumb, then there's the overly cautious nerd who only participates because he's got a crush on the leader's cute girlfriend. And, obviously, the girlfriend in question – Rocky – is basically a good person but she only turns to criminal facts because she desperately wants to offer her little sister a better life, far away from their alcoholic mother. Yawn! Thrillers/horror movies with blind protagonists that can seriously kick ass aren't exactly scarce, neither. Only recently, for example, there also was the sublime movie 'Late Phases' in which another blind middle-aged war veteran single- handedly battles a bloodthirsty werewolf. That guy lost his dog at the beginning of the film, but still he was tougher and more narcissist and – most of all – he didn't do stuff that blind people can't possibly do! Somewhere halfway in the plot of 'Don't Breathe', the burglars discover a dark and horrifying secret in the blind man's basement. This initially seems like an inventive and surprising plot twist, but not if contemplate about it a bit further. How on earth a blind person capable of arranging all this, I'd really like to know. 'Don't Breathe' certainly isn't a bad film, but judging by the current rating and the numerous praising reviews, I can safely say it's one of the most overrated thrillers of the past years.",4,2,8,21 March 2017
The Descent," Extreme sport-girls in DEEP trouble!
","With 'Dog Soldiers', director Neil Marshall clearly showed already that he was very talented and 'The Descent' confirms this statement for sure! In his second horror achievement, Marshall proves himself to be a versatile filmmaker, with ingenious new ideas and a good old-fashioned sense of grim and disturbing chaos. 'The Descent' is quite gory, but also suspenseful and full of intrigues and surprise twists, which is a really rare combination nowadays. Marshall opted for an all female cast, which is quite innovating in horror (especially blend with the other topic of extreme sports), and this evidently creases an almost natural atmosphere of competition, jealousy and betrayal that our gifted director captures on film perfectly. A circle of six friends, all into extreme sports and reckless kicks, meet to go on a caving expedition exactly one year after one of them Â– Sarah Â– lost her husband and 8 year old daughter in a tragic road accident. The ominous cave quickly becomes a deadly challenge when it turns out that the competitive leader Juno single-handedly the location. 'The Descent' is a very exciting film, with believable characters and some excellent gross-out special effects. Marshall's directing is very tight and the film's fast pacing doesn't leave you much time to ponder about possible flaws and/or plot holes. The 'residents' of the cave are effectively unsettling creations that produce frightening sounds and crawl around creepily. The ending of the film can be interpreted in several ways, which is a surprisingly intelligent and unexpected twist for such an 'ordinary' horror production. In short, 'The Descent' is highly recommended and, personally, I can't wait to see what Marshall's next project will be like.",8,4,12,22 January 2006
The Happening," Shyamalan's best in a while, but movie-miracles still ain't happening
","Please note the reviews also contains slight spoilers for 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable'. Pretty much like the rest of our cinema-loving universe, I anticipated the release of 'The Happening' with quite an unhealthy dose of skepticism. I never even bothered to watch 'Lady in the Water', but I severely disliked both 'Signs' and 'The Village' and I even think his supposedly greatest accomplishments 'Unbreakable' and 'The Sixth Sense' are vastly overrated. Still, the formula of 'The Happening' strangely appealed to me and  unlike any of the aforementioned titles  I felt to urge to go and see it on the big screen as soon as it got released. The trailer is downright fantastic and, even though you just know it already features all the film's major highlights, it literally oozes with suspense and morbidity. And also, for me personally, the opening of the film took away a massive load of skepticism and negative premonitions. Shyamalan doesn't dawdle for once and comes straight to the point after the atmospheric and moody opening credits. Strange, inexplicable and unspeakably tragic phenomena overcome the East coast of the United States. Starting within and around large national parks, people suddenly become emotionally and physically paralyzed and subsequently commit suicide as if they're instructed to do so by some sort of higher power. A large posse of petrified people, amongst them a science teacher with his emotionally troubled wife and one of his colleagues' young daughter, attempt to flee towards Philadelphia by train, but the unidentifiable menace spreads out as well. The occurrences are too complex and precise to be terrorist actions and an alien attack is entirely out of the question, so the only remaining explanation would involve a spontaneous revolt of nature. The undeniable strong-point of 'The Happening' is that M. Night Shyamalan emphasizes the mystery-aspect a lot less than in any of his previous screenplays. At first there are several wild speculations regarding the origin of the events, but once nature's involvement is established, the focus purely lies on survival of the characters and at least the film doesn't build up towards the infamous  but often disappointing  twist in the end. The concept is pretty good, however the elaboration still too often feels incoherent and unconvincing. 'The Happening' contains multiple isolated moments of sheer brilliance and  also unusual in the director's repertoire  pure horror, but as a wholesome it still isn't as powerful as it should be. The sequences in which construction workers throw themselves off rooftops, people stand in line to shoot themselves through the head with the same gun or even lie themselves down in front of a moving lawnmower are highly unsettling pieces of intense horror and probably the most shocking images M. Night Shyamalan will ever capture on film. They're especially disturbing since they're illustrated with a great sense of elegance and style, like the supernatural suicide is some work of art. In between all the menace coming from higher and incontrollable forces, the director also grabs the opportunity to depict ordinary human beings as the ultimate monsters. In their quest for survival, common people become egocentric and dangerous aggressors. It's an ancient and overused theme in Sci-Fi movies, but still very efficient and appropriate. A final and equally typical trademark in Shymalan's films is that the cast of characters doesn't feature any heroic or implausibly witty types. Taking all this and more (good acting, stunning photography, beautiful locations) into account, I'm tempted to describe 'The Happening' as a good film and a personal triumph for the writer/director, but there's something that really upsets me. M. Night Shyamalan still is an imitator! Admittedly a very subtle and discrete one, but an imitator nevertheless. The rudimentary concepts for his most acclaimed movies may come across as original and unique, but they're always somewhat borrowed from less conspicuous older films. Genuine horror fanatics will have thought about 'Carnival of Souls' and 'Dead & Buried' whilst watching 'The Sixth Sense'; 'Unbreakable' had oddly many ideas in common with two obscure 80's movies called 'Sole Survivor' and 'The Survivor' and, if you contemplate about it a little, 'The Happening' is a subtle re-working of Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds'. If you've seen this classic piece of 60's eco-horror, please take a few moments to think about the similarities.",6,3,10,16 June 2008
The Shape of Water," The Creature from Hollywood Lagoon
","I'm not in the habit of reviewing commercial success films, and definitely not if they are also Academy Award winners. However, being a giant fan of horror/fantasy movies (and cinematic monsters in particular) as well as an avid admirer of Guillermo Del Toro, I suppose I should be very happy 'The Shape of Water' won the Oscar for best film. Well, I'm not. In the 2018-edition, the one and only film that truly deserved to win was 'Three Billboards outside of Ebbing, Missouri'.'The Shape of Water' is, occasionally, a truly beautiful and emotionally confronting requiem. Presented as a homage (or maybe even a belated sequel?) to the magnificent 'Creature from the Black Lagoon', the story takes place during the gritty Cold War era and revolves around a timid and mute cleaning lady at a research laboratory who romantically bonds with a fish man-creature in captivity. Del Toro demonstrates his excellent craftsmanship via the stunning decors, the uncanny atmosphere, the dazzling use of colors and a handful of imaginatively poetic moments. And yet, there were far too many sequences that were too childish, far-fetched and preachy. Michael Shannon is a terrific actor, but his umpteenth role as an evil government agent is too much of a caricature, and so are the depictions of Octavia Spencer (as the good-hearted black woman) and Richard Jenkins (as the homosexual neighbor). If Del Toro ever deserved to win an Oscar for his fantasy oeuvre, it should have been for 'Pan's Labyrinth'.",6,2,4,10 February 2020
Zombieland," A Twinkie! My Zombie Kingdom for a TWINKIE !!!
","'Zombieland' superficially looks another umpteenth zombie-comedy, and that's definitely not a good first impression because we have literally been served dozens of these since the release of 'Shaun of the Dead' and even the most hardened horror buffs are slowly beginning to disregard them. However, this is one zombie movie that has to be seen by both genre fanatics as well as by people who are merely interested in a good hour and a half of laughs, ingenuity and cheerful acting performances. 'Zombieland' is a seemingly unpretentious and straightforward mainstream horror movie, but it's actually a lot more intelligent than it looks. For starters, Ruben Fleischer's film slyly evades the whole set-up and origin of the zombie plague. The United States of America have turned into Zombieland in barely two months and that's just the way it is. All the slow and stupid people have died and lead character Columbus only briefly refers to the virus that caused all this death and destruction, but apart from that the film only focuses on here and now. Survival is the only thing that counts. To remain alive, the lone and nerdy teenager Columbus – named after his hometown – composed a simple list of essential Zombieland rules. These particular list of rules, which is regularly referred to, is another very intelligent an vital element of the script. The rules practically summarize the essence of zombie horror cinema! The include simple and obvious tips like aim for the brain and always check the backseat prior to getting in a car, but these are things that everyone already yelled to other films in an annoyed tone of voice, because people keep making the same stupid mistakes. Columbus first teams up with the macho cowboy Tallahassee, who seems more interested in finding a Twinkie than in surviving the zombie mayhem, and subsequently the deceptive sisters Wichita and Little Rock who steal their car  twice. Although the general conception in Zombieland is that you're better of alone, the four versatile survivors travel together and develop a peculiar friendship. The third really smart thing about 'Zombieland' is that it contains quite a few effective and beautiful metaphors about things like friendship, sacrifice, puppy love and even humanity. The diversification of characters results in a lot of terrific dialogs and downright hilarious situations. Columbus is an anxious and phobic nerd whereas his partner Tallahassee (glorious role for Woody Harrelson) is a trigger-happy hillbilly who finally found a purpose in life: killing zombies. There are numerous great sequences, including adrenalin-rushing opening credits to the sound of Metallica's 'For whom the Bell Tolls', a cameo of a fantastic Hollywood star as himself and a brilliant finale in a Californian amusement park. The film isn't too gory (ideally accessible for larger audiences, in other words) but the make-up effects on the zombies are splendid and occasionally quite scary (the clown zombie!). The film may perhaps have been inspired by the aforementioned 'Shaun of the Dead', but it's a soon-to-be-classic by itself. It's the most entertaining and feel-good horror film of the year!",8,1,7,2 May 2010
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Child-friendly but definitely not childish!
","Nearly 8 years and 6 films later, this was only my very first acquaintance with the Harry Potter franchise. I obnoxiously considered myself not to be a part of the target audience (too old and anti-computer generated effects), even though the copious fantasy & horror ingredients always somewhat triggered my curiosity. I literally waited until this second installment in the series was programmed on national television and I was too lazy to switch the channel. It didn't take too long before I regretted having waited this long, as 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is a vastly entertaining and impressively accomplished blockbuster. Obviously I can't compare it to anything else, as I haven't seen any of the other films and never even held one of J.K. Rowling's books in my hands, but you don't need comparison in order to know this is excellent fun to enjoy with a big pack of popcorn. According to most reviewing people around here, this second film is already a lot darker and more sinister than 'The Sorcerer's Stone' and apparently the series gradually grew more mature. Me, I was already quite astounded with the amount and types of morbidity featuring in this. 'The Chamber of Secrets' is child-friendly, but definitely not childish. Of course there aren't any explicit death sequences shown on screen, but there's loads of creepy stuff (giant spiders, snake-monsters, spontaneously combusting birds, ) that I imagine can be quite nightmarish. Following a successful rescue operation executed by his gingered best friend Weasley, Harry Potter escapes from his insufferable distant relatives and heads back for Hogwarts to attend his second year of wizardry. Even during the journey already and especially upon their arrival, it becomes obvious there's something strange going on. Perhaps Dobby, the overly humble and nervous little elf who came to warn Harry about not returning to school, was right. The rumors about the Chamber of Secrets reopening itself are getting louder and louder. This never before found chamber allegedly homes a hideous monster that destroys all the students whose blood isn't 100% pure wizard blood. Yeah okay, the plot is *slightly* more convoluted that this, but obviously I can't summarize 161 minutes of film and 360 pages of book in just a couple of sentences. The important thing to know is that 'Chamber of Secrets' is a spectacularly fast-paced and non-stop adventurous film full of visual gimmicks and widely versatile fantasy elements. The cast choices are excellent. The child actors do terrific jobs and particularly the teachers at Hogwarts are stupendously cast. Richard Harris (who passed away before the theatrical release), Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane are great as the 'Good Samaritan' teachers, but my preference obviously goes out to the more malignant and eccentric characters. Alan Rickman as the uncanny Professor Snape and especially Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy provide an additional eerie atmosphere with their presence and Kenneth Branagh shines as the hoax magician and wannabe media superstar Gilderoy Lockhart.",8,1,2,31 December 2008
Psycho," The one and only !
","Millions of movie reviews by respect critics as well as by ordinary film fans have confirmed this many times already: Psycho is a true masterpiece and one of the most influential and original horror stories ever shown. I have very few to add to that, except for the fact that I couldn't agree more with this status. I'm not a giant fan of Alfred Hitchcock but I do find that he deserves his title 'master of suspense'. If it were only for this movie alone. Psycho is the most important modern horror movie since it gave a whole new image to the character of the 'serial killer'. Norman Bates is frightening but there's always sympathy for him. He's the most influential horror icon without a doubt. I doubt that there're many people who don't now about the terrific climax by now. I've heard spoilers about this movie before I knew it even existed...But still, there are always surprises to discover and no matter how many times you see it you'll always be impressed. Other than that, there isn't much to say about this milestone in cinema. Watch this movie if you haven't yet and don't go on calling yourself a cinema fan before you see it !! But, avoid the 1998 remake at all costs! Although there are a few decent actors in that ( William H.Macy, Julliane Moore and Viggo Mortensen ) it's a disgrace to Alfred Hitchcock and to everyone else who was involved with the original version",9,4,14,13 September 2003
The Witch," Danger! Evil-staring Lagomorphs
","I got intrigued by the premise of 'The Witch', like many others with me I presume, because it's allegedly based on authentic writings and immigrant stories from the actual era in which it takes place; namely New England in the 17th Century! Far too few horror stories take place in the Middle-Ages, if you ask me, and - at least to my recollection - the existing ones are only loosely inspired on contemporary historical milestones, like the several interpretations of the infamous Salem witch trials in 1692. The tale of 'The Witch' is situated much earlier in that same dark century – in the year 1630 - and focuses on a family that gets banished to the far edge of the community, to a farm right next to an ominous forest, where they gradually get confronted with occult occurrences, so the least you can say about the concept is that it is original. The first reviews that I read on the internet or in specialized magazines were also very stimulating, as they practically unanimously agreed that 'The Witch' is indescribably atmospheric and petrifying. Having seen the film now, I can definitely concur  'The Witch' is most certainly a unique experience when it comes to eerie atmosphere. Literally from start to finish, writer/director Robert Eggers creates a gloomy and foreboding ambiance that makes you uncomfortable and keeps you on the edge of your seat, even when there's basically nothing happening at all. The slow pacing, integer character drawings, bleak performances and silent but sinister extended shots of the forest and treetops all contribute enormously to the mounting of the tension, but there was one element in particular that personally struck me as ultimately macabre and innovative. Robert Eggers and his obviously multi-talented cinematographer Jarin Blaschke excel in filming ordinary animals but simultaneously making them come across as extremely menacing and even pure evil, like the goat – Black Philip – but especially also the uncannily staring hare! Can you imagine After literally having seen and reviewed thousands of horror movies, I honestly never had thought that I would get uncomfortable from looking straight into the penetrating eyes of a  rabbit! Unfortunately, the atmosphere and these unique peaks of suspense are the only true strongpoints of 'The Witch' (apart maybe also from the solid performances). The plot, even though compelling and full of potential, is too thin while the continuous biblical speeches & dialogs are somewhat unnerving (although I surely reckon that the religious overtone is inseparably linked to the era). Since even the tense atmosphere is something you get used to quite rapidly, the lack of an actual plot and narrative structure causes the film to become soporific. To simply label 'The Witch' as a period horror piece would also be unjust, as it much more qualifies as a harrowing drama, particularly during the many scenes where the family loses another child or gets torn apart due to (false?) witchcraft accusations. Being a father of a newborn child myself, the sudden and inexplicably mysterious disappearance of baby Samuel had a more than nightmarish effect on me. All this and more (style, casting choices, period recreation ) to at least ensure us that Robert Eggers is a promising and out-of-the-ordinary young director to keep an eye on! That same goes for the naturally beautiful and gifted young actress Anya Taylor-Joy.",6,1,3,27 September 2016
Rosemary's Baby," Although the film itself looks dated, the screenplay is still one of horror's best and most unsettling!
","Assuming that pretty much everyone knows about the plot of this film by now, I won't pen down another synopsis... Personally, I always thought that Roman Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' is much more of an intelligently scripted conspiracy-drama, rather than a diabolical horror story. The most captivating element about this film is NOT the presence of witch covens and devil-worshipers, but the depressing transformation Mia Farrow's character goes through. Rosemary Woodhouse is introduced as a healthy and happily married housewife with a strong desire to raise a family but near the end she's a tormented woman, obviously hurt and disappointed by the people she cared for most. The screenplay of this classic title  adapted from Ira Levin's novella by Polanski himself  definitely doesn't rush things and establishes an atmospheric portrait in which it's never really clear whether the occurring events are real...or fragments of Rosemary's frustrated imagination. Polanski severely tests his viewers here! You presume that the supernaturalness is there and that there really are witches, since you mainly witness it all from Rosemary's viewpoints but ... Aren't we imagining as well? The constant and brutal blending of reality and hallucination is what really feels disturbing here... And I can guarantee it's more genuinely disturbing than showing actual witch-rites or bloody massacres. This surely isn't a film for all types of audiences, since it's very slow and almost bloodless. If you don't approach the story in the right state of mind, many sequences will seem tedious and pointless. Many aspects also look quite dated by now (woman luckily aren't as docile and obedient to their husbands anymore) and the intense melancholia-tone often is very hard to digest.",7,2,9,21 August 2005
War of the Worlds," E.T. Phones Back ... With a Vengeance!
","Being a gigantic fan-boy of 50's nostalgia and particularly the cinematic Sci-Fi milestones this decade brought forward, I was rather reluctant at first to check out the new and improved (read: massively budgeted) version of HG. Wells' legendary novel 'The War of the Worlds'. The 1953 original is a brilliant film and, in my humble opinion, still perfectly able to petrify any type of viewer, so  like most nowadays remakes  it would be a completely redundant film only intended for young kids that refuse to watch movies in black & white. Most of all I was concerned that the emphasis would lay too much on the expensive computer-engineered effects and the good looks of star Tom Cruise, whereas the original primarily revolved on the portrayal of mass hysteria and growing desperation amongst the earthly population. Well I love to be proved wrong; especially when it comes to prejudices I have towards Sci-Fi and horror movies. Steven Spielberg handles the material very well and doesn't lose the grip on suspense in favor of sentiment, which admittedly I feared would happen. Tom Cruise doesn't depict a savior type of character, but an average kind of guy with several issues of his own, who now suddenly becomes forced to forget everything and save his children. Just when his ex-wife requests Ray to look after their kids, superior creatures from other unspecified worlds attack the entire planet. It starts with a long series of eerie lightening and all electrical and motored equipment breaks down. Subsequently gigantic and super hi-tech advanced tripod monsters emerge from the ground  like they've been buried there since ancient times  and promptly begin with the extermination of the entire human race. Their weapons literally pulverize people, their scouting machinery is a gazillion times more sophisticated than any earthly defense mechanism and in less than a couple of days our planet turns into a wasteland. For the first time his life, Ray will have to take responsibility and escort his estranged offspring to Boston. Steven Spielberg already had quite a bit of experience with alien-movies, but you can hardly compare the concept of 'War of the World' with either 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' or 'E.T.' This is first and foremost a haunting tale about invasion and destruction, and there's very little room for sentimental sub plots. The inevitable storyline of Ray slowly bonding with his initially hesitant children is the only emotional content, and actually quite bearable (the forced happy-ending not included). Several sequences are downright fantastic, like all the ones with Tim Robbins (depicting some sort of paranoid hermit) and indescribably spectacular to behold, like the ones where the immense tripods go on their relentless rampages (destroying churches, capsizing ferry boats, etc). Needless to say the use of special and digital effects are as good as flawless. The alien creatures' design is perhaps a bit cheesy, but what the hell, at least their tripods and scouting equipment are breath taking. You could go on and on reviewing the little shortcomings and/or analyzing the hidden symbolism, but it all simply comes down to the fact that 'War of the Worlds' is an efficiently made and highly enjoyable popcorn blockbuster movie.

30 Days of Night," 30 Buckets of Fake Blood and CGI Splatter
","Around its time of release and another while after that, '30 Days of Night' was an extremely popular topic of conversation around Internet film forums and it also received quite a bit of media attention as well as favorable reviews from eminent critics. Now, barely a year later, nobody hardly even mentions it anymore; so I guess we're not dealing with an instant cult classic after all. Personally I wasn't in such a hurry to watch it on the big screen or even straight away when it came out on rental, because I'm not a big supporter of vampire movies and I'm definitely not too keen on computer-engineered splatter effects, which this large-budgeted movie was obviously stuffed with. But hey, allegedly this was the most original and innovating vampire movie in decades, with a noteworthy cast and mouth-watering gore effects, so if you're a fan of the genre you do have to see it sooner or later eventually. I'm the first to admit the rudimentary concept actually does have a lot of potential and actually is innovating! Vampires invading the most Northern little city in Alaska where the sun sets for 30 days straight? Awesome! How come nobody ever thought that before? It's so simple, yet so effective and rich in possibilities. The problem, however, is that director David Slade and his three-headed team of scriptwriters don't make proper use of even one third of all the great potential here! The opening sequences are still terrific, with a human ally of the vampires destroying all means of communication on the last day of sunlight in order to make sure there's absolutely no escape. The actual invasion is reasonably exciting as well, but it goes wrong immediately after that. Approximately 95% of the town's population gets exterminated during the first day of night, but are we then really supposed to believe that the handful of remaining survivors remain entrenched in an attic for 29 more days and with a posse of bloodthirsty vampires outside? After the virulent first half hour, director Slade hasn't got any script material left to work with and thus the story suddenly leaps from day 7 onto day 18 and forward to day 27, completely ruining the solely unique gimmick this movie has. Believe it or not, but once the vampires invaded the town of Barrow, '30 Days of Night' honestly turns into a largely dull and monotonous B-movie. The rest of the film is rather weak as well. The vampires easily rank amongst the least menacing ones I've ever seen. They wear cheap-looking suits (!), screech like teenage Goth-girls and speak in a ridiculous and sissy Romanian dialect. Especially the lead bloodsucker (Danny Huston) evokes more chuckles than frights, mainly because none of the things he says make any sense. The blood and gore effects might appear extreme and incredibly exciting if you're an overanxious horror-rookie, but they're not likely to impress anyone else. It's really just a whole lot of CGI splatter but in the end we don't even witness one half-decent moment of genuine carnage. Although he started out in the genre (with 'Halloween H²O' and 'The Faculty'), Josh Hartnett now obviously feels too good to star in a horror flick and his performance is in proportion. Ben Foster depicts a terrific and genuinely uncanny character, but sadly his role is too brief. '30 Days of Night' isn't worth checking out but  like I said  you're going to end up watch it, anyway. Just do yourself a favor and keep your expectations low.",3,2,10,2 October 2008
Downfall," A mesmerizing experience and one that will hopefully remind people all over the world that history may never repeat itself!
","All I can say about 'Der Untergang' is: WOW! This is one of those rare films that prove that the darkest pages in our world history easily surpass the fiction tales of the most imaginative fantasist. This soon-to-be landmark in cinema portrays the final ten days of Hitler's reign at the well hidden bunker in Berlin. In the opening sequences, we see how the Führer hires Traudl Junge (flawless performance by Alexandra Maria Lara) as his personal secretary and we largely witness the rest of the story from her viewpoint. Recent documentary footage with the real Junge is showed to audience at the end of the movie, stressing even more that this is a very intelligent and carefully elaborated production. A form of criticism I often encountered stated that Hitler was portrayed too 'human' by the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz. Let me tell you that people who claim this haven't got the slightest clue what they're talking about! It's true that Hitler sometimes strokes his dogor even gives a compliment to his servant for cooking him such a lovely dinner! But only moments after, you're exposed to the real Hitler again! Alternately a mad-raving dictator, a disillusioned conqueror or simply a pathetic old man. But perhaps the most astonishing scenes in 'Der Untergang' are the ones in which the persons close to Hitler  either professional or amicable  remain unconditionally loyal to him! It is deeply disturbing to behold how so many people blindly swear by the unworldly beliefs of a madman, even prepared to follow him into death. This accurate portrait results in a series of brilliant sequences with the severely shocking fate of the Goebbels family as an absolute highlight.Purely talking in terms of cinema, 'Der Untergang' comes dangerously close to perfection as well. The largest part of this film exists out of interior shots, more specifically the bunker-network where Hitler lasted his final days and eventually committed suicide. And the atmosphere inside this bunker is reflected on the movie-screen as genuine as humanly possible. You can nearly smell the fear of the lower-ranked officers! You can almost feel the shivering of the petrified secretaries! I really hate using a cliché sentence like this butit's trueit's like you are there yourself! And you don't want to be there! Even the totally demolished streets of Berlin looks look more appealing than the claustrophobic Nazi bunker. This despicable chapter in history deserves an accurate and well-budgeted cinema version, if only just for passing on the inglorious stories of WWII to younger generations. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel terrifically turned Joachim Fest's novel into a mesmerizing film experience. Perhaps the most praiseworthy aspect about it all is that 'Der Untergang' simply is a reconstruction of the facts! No lame and amateurish attempts to blame Hitler's actions on miserable childhoods or traumatizing experiences. Simply put: this is fundamental viewing!",10,62,72,18 January 2005
Army of Darkness," Bruce Campbell kicks medieval butt in the last part of this GREAT franchise.
","Well, one thing you can't possibly say about Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' trilogy would be that it's dull or repetitive! The series went from hardcore horror ('The Evil Dead') to splatter comedy ('Evil Dead 2') and this final entry is almost pure slapstick with only an occasional flash of gore. Bruce Campbell, who evolved incredibly as an actor, reprises his role of chainsaw-swinging hero Ash who's now catapulted back in time to somewhere early in the medieval era. In order to get back to his supermarket job in the 20th century, he has to join and train a castle community in their battle against evil. Ash's very own clone leads the evil troops and they largely exist out of walking 'n talking skeletons. 'Army of Darkness' is a very funny and light-headed film that ignores the horror in favor of funny gimmicks and cheerful swashbuckling. That's not necessarily a bad thing but it's understandable that most people rate it as the least good part of the series. Bruce Campbell, however, is terrific and this definitely is the role that defined him as the ultimate horror icon of the last two decades. Some of his quotes are already considered classic by now ('Hail to the King, Baby', 'Shop smart. Shop S-Mart') and most fans are still secretly hoping for a third sequel. The 'March of the Dead'-theme by Danny Elfman is splendid and Sam Raimi's direction is as professional as ever. Unlike the previous Evil Dead installments, 'Army of Darkness' may not be a genre milestone but it sure remains great fun to watch it over and over again.",7,1,7,22 July 2005
Scream 2," Lesser sequel, but at least they knew it and laughed about it.
","The undeniable best sequence in this film – as well as in all three 'Scream' films, for that matter – involves the geeky horror connoisseur character Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) fanatically venting about his favorite, albeit cliché-laden genre. As this is a rapidly produced sequel to an unexpectedly successful horror blockbuster, Randy – with the help of an entire movie class - vividly rants how sequels never match up against the ingenuity and intellect of their predecessors. That scene alone is pretty clever already, in fact, because it feels as if director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson want to safeguard themselves against delivering a potentially inferior product. 'Scream 2' isn't a bad film, especially not in comparison with the majority of horror junk that was coming out in the aftermath of the original 'Scream', but indeed no match for the first. The screenplay actually does faithfully feature all the sequel clichés, like a higher death toll (particularly near the end, it seems like everybody must die) and a bloodier make-up effects. The film is also overlong and tries to be a little too clever in all its 90's pop-culture observations. Good aspects, however, include the successful change of location from a typical small town towards a university campus. Both settings are typical 80's horror fare settings. The survivors of the original film have obviously grown in their roles and the production managed to attract some interesting fresh new faces for the principal roles (like Timothy Olyphant, Jerry O'Connell and Sarah Michelle Gellar) as well as some cool cameos (like David Warner, Heather Graham and Luke Wilson). The plot of the sequel is as simplistic and rudimentary as that of the original. Sidney Prescott and her friend Randy are trying to carry on with their lives two years after the Woodsboro murders. When a young couple gets killed during the premiere of 'Stab' – a horror flick based on the Woodsboro murders – it quickly becomes clear there's a copycat killer after Sidney. Despite some really good ideas and a few moments of admirable suspense (the escape from the crashed car, for example), 'Scream 2' is a repetitive and forgettable film.",5,2,10,15 October 2009
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Beautiful film, pitiable Dracula character
","Yours truly grew up during the early 90s and thus my first encounters with the classic and immortal horror sagas where the contemporary large-budgeted and bombastic blockbusters of prolific directors that starred a bunch of Hollywood icons. Kenneth Brannagh modernized 'Mary Shelley's Frankenstein', Francis Ford Coppola revised 'Bram Stoker''s Dracula' and, to a lesser extent, there were also Mike Nichols' 'Wolf' (the updated 'Wolf Man') and Stephen Frears' 'Mary Reilly' (basically 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' from a different viewpoint). They're all fine films and I still consider them as essential contributors to my love for the horror genre, but somehow, I wish that I started chronologically with the Universal horrors starring Lugosi, Karloff, Chaney, etc...This completely personal and irrelevant trivia note aside, Coppola's ambitious and prestigious retelling of 'Dracula', which remains incredibly faithful to the original Bram Stoker novel, still stands as an overwhelming cinematic achievement. The film is 25 years old already in the meantime, but the decors, costumes, photography, make-up and special effects are still breathtaking even by today's high and sadly digitalized standards. 'Dracula' is undoubtedly a pure work of art to behold, but putting the emphasis on the vampire count's romantic traumas and his pitiable craving to be reunited with his 15th Century's wife Elizabeta obviously didn't do the horror impact a lot of good. Count Dracula, once a bloodthirsty warrior who turned against God because his beloved wife killed herself, imprisons young attorney Jonathan Harker in his Transylvanian castle after he sees a picture of his fiancée Mina. She seemingly is the reincarnation of Elizabeta and thus Dracula travels to his recently purchased Carfax Abbey in Britain to reclaim her. Mina's best friend Lucy, and then Mina herself, immediately fall for Dracula's hypnotizing charms and mystical powers, but Lucy's three (!) lovers fight back and even call upon the help of the infamous Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. There's a good reason why Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee are eternally reckoned for their respective roles as Count Dracula; - namely because they depicted him as an evil, invincible and relentless horror monster! Although Gary Oldman still remarkably succeeds in making his Dracula performance somewhat menacing and creepy, the script introduces the lead character as a grieving and immortal widower. Long white fingers, weird hairdos and diabolical laughter aside, this vampire isn't frightening. Gary Oldman is always great, even when the role is really difficult, but apart from him only Tom Waits puts down a memorable performance as Renfield. Anthony Hopkins is quite pompous as Van Helsing and both Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder are too immature for their roles. 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' nonetheless remains a must-see for every self-respecting horror fan (and even every film fan in general) if it were only for the lavish sets and stunning decors, the enchanting soundtrack (Annie Lennox' 'Love Song for a Vampire' is a classic), the sublime photography and subtle display of eroticism (including a young Monica Belluci as a bride!) and the few but notably atmospheric moments of true horror (like the sequences inside Lucy's tomb)",7,2,5,21 March 2018
Jaws," Slightly overrated...but definitely a trend-setter!
","'Jaws' is a tense, intelligent and compelling adventure that still counts as Steven Spielberg's second best film, after his downright brilliant debut 'Duel'. Nonetheless, apart from the terrific idea to introduce a 'creature of nature' as an invincible nemesis, this movie lacks a few essential aspects to be labeled masterpiece, in my humble opinion. That, of course, doesn't mean that it isn't a must-see film! 'Jaws' is an exhilarating movie-experience and also an excellent reminder that Spielberg used to make gripping films for adult audiences, rather than dull and childish epics with an overuse of sentiment. The clever screenplay (mostly written by Peter Benchley) neatly divides this film into two parts. The first part is really splendid, with the quiet island community of Amity slowly growing aware of the fact that they've got a serious water-problem on their hands. The first (and severely mutilated) bodies of shark-attack victims begin to wash ashore but the obnoxious mayor initially refuses to acknowledge the problem out of fear tourists will stay away during the summer-opening weekend. This first half is very suspenseful (the opening on the tunes of John Williams' world-famous score!!), the camera-work is exquisite and there's some nice hillbilly-humor in the script. The second half has three specialists going out to sea in order to hunt down and kill the great white shark. Police chief Brody (Scheider), independent sea-hunter Quint (Shaw) and oceanographer Hooper (Dreyfuss) play cat and mouse on open water with an impressive monster they yet don't properly know the enormous proportions of (hence the classic quote 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' when Brody first beholds the shark). Personally, I think this second part is a bit overlong and overall not as involving as the first. However, the character-drawing of our 3 heroes is brilliant and Shaw's 'Indianapolis'-monologue is still very chilling (it took three additional scriptwriters to perfection this legendary speech). The film's climax is very bloody and therefore a rewarding ending.I guess the main reason why I love this movie is because of the trend it started. Steven Spielberg and his film single-handedly launched an endless series of ripoffs and outrageous creature-features that nearly turn every animal on this planet into ravenous monsters. I make a hobby out of tracking down the films that were obviously inspired by this milestone. The sea-monster movies remain the coolest, for sure. There are a lot of worthwhile rip-off's to be found; like 'Orca Â– Killer Whale', 'Pirahna' or 'Alligator' but even more stinkers like 'Tentacles', 'Tintorera - Tiger Shark' or 'Killer Fish'.",7,4,13,7 May 2005
Kingpin," Grab a seat, have a few beers...and start laughing !!
","My favorite actor once wrote in one of his best movies ' All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy' ... That's how I felt about this movie. I love a decent and serious drama or epic but sometimes I just feel like laughing silly and lower my brain activity. And Kinpin is one of the best films to do this. Sprung from the mind of the Farrelly brothers, this comedy about the bowling world is hilarious. Well acted by respectable actors and filled with great jokes and quote-material. Just the right doses of sentimental elements and (almost) never over the top. Back in 1979, Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) was a very gifted bowler. Due to the bad influence of Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray in a great role) his bowling hand was mutilated by villains. Now 17 years later, Roy is a schmuck and a drunk. He meets the very naive Amish guy Ishmaël ( Randy Quaid ) who is a great bowling talent. Roy wants to take him to Reno where a bowling contest is held. At first Ishmaël doesn't want to cause it doesn't fit in his Amish way of life but when his fathers tells him the community needs money he finally agrees. The way to Reno and the search for money causes a lot of hilarious situations. They meet a gorgeous woman, Claudia (Vanessa Angel) and she joins them to their trip to Reno. All the actors give a terrific performance. All that Vanessa Angel has to do is being sexy, of course, but she does that like no other woman could. Randy Quaid is cast perfect in the role of the Amish son of a farmer. His naive way of life give us the funniest scenes in the movie. I'm a big fan of Woody Harrelson and I think he can handle comedy as good as the serious roles he played in Natural Born Killers and The People vs Larry Flint. OK, he was in the funny sitcom Cheers but the this is a whole other kind of comedy. The supporting roles are very good as well, and the landlady is the first that comes to mind. Great, I tell you !! This is my personal favorite of the Farrelly bros. Although I laughed very hard with Dumb & Dumber and Something about Mary too, this film has something special. I can't really explain what that is. Anyway, this film is highly recommended to everyone who can appreciate a good comedy and isn't easily offended. People may claim that it's vulgar, but I think that's rather relative. I think it's a lot less vulgar than those typical high school comedies like American Pie. It's more accessible for people too in my opinion.",8,1,6,18 July 2003
Kong: Skull Island," Tour of Duty makes an excursion to Skull Island
","I usually don't comment on massively budgeted blockbusters, but 'Kong: Skull Island' is such a joyfully tongue-in-cheek homage to giant monster B-movie cinema that I simply had to make an exception! This is a tremendously over-the-top and silly creature-feature, but the undemanding popcorn-entertainment value is just irresistible. The original King Kong, from 1933 already, is a monumental piece of cinema and still very powerful today. The more recent (2005) and expensive Peter Jackson remake was, at least in my humble opinion, a very boring and overlong romantic drama. 'Kong: Skull Island' nicely falls right between these two extremes. By no means, it's great cinema, but at least it provides thrills, chuckles and adrenaline rushes from start to finish. The intro and scene-setting are already incredibly dumb, but oh so fun! We're supposed to believe that there exists a secret government agency (yes, another one) named Monarch, and their area of expertise is searching around the world for monsters and oversize animals. In 1973, The agency's CEO (an energetic John Goodman) benefices from the US-army's retreat out of Vietnam to recover soldiers and assets for a mission to the secretive Skull Island; a place where - and I quote - God left his creation unfinished.'Kong: Skull Island' certainly doesn't waste any time! The helicopters have barely begun circling over the island, and there already emerges the humongous ape King Kong to slap them out of the sky like tiny ping-pong balls! The few remaining soldiers, led by the frustrated platoon leader Samuel L. Jackson, continue on foot and swear to destroy King Kong, but they soon learn that the island homes lots of other giant and unspeakably evil monstrous creations, and that Kong isn't even such a bad fella. It's a mission impossible to take this film seriously, but with the right mindset (and perhaps a few six-packs of beer) you'll have a great time. Seeing the story takes place in 1973 and has an abundantly clear Vietnam collection, it also somewhat feels like a long-feature 'Tour of Duty' movie with a downright awesome 70s soundtrack. The special effects are cheesy and exaggerated, the dialogues are deliciously tacky ('hm, a mushroom...that means there must a river nearby!') and the casting is perfect. I already mentioned John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson, but there's also John C. Reilly as the bewildered WWII veteran who's been stuck on the island since 1942.",7,2,4,22 November 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Agatha Christie certainly doesn't need to be ashamed
","Yours truly is a massive admirer of Mrs. Agatha Christie! If her hand-written grocery lists ever become published, I will surely read them and watch the film adaptations! Many people in my surrounding asked me if I was ecstatic when the news got spread about the upcoming and hi-budgeted new version of 'Murder on the Orient Express'. Well, yes and no. Contrary to general belief, there certainly isn't a shortage of Agatha Christie adaptations. The 'Queen of Crime' died more than 40 years ago, but just recently I purchased the newly released mini-series 'And then there were none' and 'Witness for the Prosecution', which are both produced by the BBC and star an impressive list of famous players. Indeed, there hasn't been a cinematic adaptation in quite a while, but personally I didn't see the need for one. Fans of Christie's work can easily enough find the aforementioned mini-series, or a variety of other TV-series, on DVD, but are her writings still appealing enough to be shown on the big screen? After all, Christie delivered old-fashioned whodunits and convoluted detective stories that invite the audience to guess along for clues and red herrings, but my impression is that people generally don't care for these anymore. Whodunit stories have evolved into CSI showcasing and modern detectives turned into superheroes who are able to solve a crime before it properly happened, like for example in the new 'Sherlock' series with Benedict Cumberbatch. Of course I'm happy there is a new Christie adaptation, but honestly I was even more concerned that it would flop at the box office. Kenneth Brannagh even took an additional - but comprehensible - risk by choosing 'Murder on the Orient Express' as his project. Partially thanks to the fantastic 1974 film version directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Albert Finny, this has arguably become Christie's most well-known tale and literally everyone who saw the film or read the book will have remembered the denouement. But once again it turns out that I was overly worried! Kenneth Brannagh's 'Murder on the Orient Express' is by no means a masterpiece, but certainly an entertaining and very competently made mystery/thriller. I'm grateful that it remained a traditional adaptation that treats the source material with great respect. In other words, Hercule Poirot luckily didn't rejuvenate into a martial-arts action hero, while the cinematography and decors are kept stylish and sober rather than turning the whole thing into a hyperkinetic and winnable trendy 'The Matrix' clone. And the story? Well, the story is still powerful enough to remain surprising and absorbing. Just as the 1974 version, this film can rely on an impressive all-star cast including names like Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench and Dereck Jacobi. Some of these big names have really few screen time, but they will lure people to the theater nevertheless. Kenneth Brannagh himself depicts an admirable and likable Hercule Poirot, although perhaps the size of the iconic mustache is slightly exaggerated.",7,1,4,22 December 2017
The Cannonball Run," Mediocre race movie
","Silly, insignificant and most of all forgettable screwball action/comedy; principally made to further cash in on the success of the 'Smokey & the Bandit' movies with largely the same cast and crew. The concept is actually a complete rip-off of the obscure but totally awesome so-called 70's carsploitation classic 'Cannonball', directed by Paul Bartel and starring David Carradine. There's a bunch of eccentric people participating in an illegally organized cross-country race from to New York to California. That's pretty much everything. The rest of the film jumps back and forth between the large variety of characters and their crazy encounters along the way. The main polestars are macho man J.J. McClure (star Burt Reynolds) in his ambulance, his jolly chubby sidekick who transforms into superhero Captain Chaos, two heavy-drinking gamblers dressed up as priests in a Ferrari, a spoiled rich boy convinced he's Roger Moore and two voluptuous babes in a Lamborghini. 'Cannonball Run' was probably the most fun to make and (re-)watch for all the major stars involved. They're clearly having a terrific time hanging out with each other, both in front and behind the camera. The list of famous names is impressive, with apart from Reynolds and Moore also Farrah Fawcett, Dom DeLuise, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Jackie Chan, Adrienne Barbeau and Peter Fonda. They're enjoying themselves, but it's not like they're giving away great performances. The only fantastic performance comes from Jack Elam as the totally deranged and crazy-eyed doctor Van Helsing. The film contains a disappointingly small amount of car stunts and/or action sequences. The aforementioned 'Cannonball' is a lot better, also because it features more sarcasm and black humor whereas this film continuously remains politically correct.",5,2,4,13 June 2010
The Conjuring," Ghost tale with power and panache!
","I'm always very wary and skeptical when it comes to slow-brooding and atmospheric nowadays ghost movies. All too often the setting, scenery and atmosphere are meticulously perfect, but the plot is confusing, full of major holes or even just downright inexistent. Ti West's 'The Innkeepers', for instance, is such an example of a recent ghost story that is full of suggestive horror tableaux and false scares, like slow moving cameras through the hallways and doors slowly closing by themselves, but eventually it leads absolutely nowhere and the overall film ends up being a disappointment. The last thing anyone could say about 'The Conjuring' is that it exclusively features suggestive imagery and false scares! Quite the contrary, this is probably the most action-packed and gruesome ghost story ever made. But the thing that makes 'The Conjuring' a truly great horror accomplishment is that it masterfully combines the gruesome stuff with a powerful plot AND a petrifying atmosphere! The set-up and rudimentary plot is traditional stuff, with a happy family – mum, dad and five daughters no less – moving into a large and isolated countryside mansion where, evidently, a number of horrible events took place in the past. This house doesn't just hold one single dark secret, oh no, it's pretty much a museum of horrors and a hotbed for sinister occurrences! One small piece of advice: if the dog refuses to cross the doorstep, don't even bother to unload the car. Paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren quickly have to come to the rescue, but even they haven't visited such a hopelessly ominous place in all their years of experience. It may sound like a giant cliché, but 'The Conjuring' is one of the sole movies in its kind that makes you feel uncomfortable the entire time, like there are evil spirits sitting behind you in the theater and breathing down your neck! Like he already demonstrated in 'Insidious' and the shamefully underrated (in my humble opinion, at least) 'Dead Silence', director James Wan has a wonderful talent to select the utmost nightmarish scenery, like the creepy doll and the gloomy piano in the cellar. The scares are also professionally timed, highly efficient and accomplished with make-up effects disturbing enough to surprise even die-hard genre freaks. The acting performances are more than adequate, from the adult lead stars as well as from the five young girls. The climax is slightly unsatisfying, but in defense of the film, I also have to admit immediately that it's very difficult to come up with a finale that matches the build-up.",8,1,5,1 October 2013
Scream," Scream and scream again and again!
","It's been more than a decade since I last watched 'Scream' – probably right after it got released in theaters or something – and honestly have to admit I never was a big fan of this much-hyped blockbuster. To me personally (admittedly I was just an over-enthusiast horror fanatic who just started to find his way around the genre) it was simply a mockery against really unsettling movies and the one film that suddenly turned everyone into a horror buff overnight. Also, and maybe even most importantly, 'Scream' was single-handedly responsible for a massive overload of inferior and sometimes even downright retarded knock-offs, imitations, zero-budgeted amateur trash slasher flicks. Suddenly and thanks to the simplistic concept of this movie, everyone considered him/herself capable of making a horror movie and sadly enough most of them even found ways of distribution as well. This was my personal blunt opinion on 'Scream' more than ten years ago. By now, I still think it's a vastly overrated movie and definitely not the best horror film of the nineties (my vote for that either goes to 'Braindead' or 'Candyman'), but my opinions regarding the actual film's quality surely have changed. 'Scream', and particularly Kevin Williamson's screenplay, is very clever and witty in its observations on the contemporary teen pop culture and it covers a pretty impressive range of old horror trivia. Wes Craven, who in his career alternatively tackled some hits ('The Hills have Eyes', 'Deadly Blessing', 'Nightmare on Elm Streeet') and some misses ('Shocker', 'Vampire in Brooklyn') was the ideal choice of director for a film that simultaneously spoofs and pays tribute to a popular film genre that thrives on clichés, stereotypes and gratuitous scares. Last but certainly not least, the actual story offers a handful of genuinely uncanny moments as well as some neat unpredictable twists. Simply the opening sequence starring Drew Barrymore already – which I suppose everybody knows about by now – is enough indication that anything can happen to any disposable character in this film. The premise is rudimentary and ancient, with a spooky masked killer terrorizing a small high school and particularly one girl whose mum got massacred one year earlier, but that's all there is necessary. Good performances, tight direction, classy photography, dazzling soundtrack and a truckload of nauseating murder set pieces do the rest. Recommended for all type of horror-appreciating audiences.",7,4,9,13 October 2009
Halloween," Not A slasher film...THE slasher film !!!
","As a regular user on this site, I did a survey recently concerning all the true horror fans. All fans were asked to give their top 10 favorite titles in this wonderful genre and with all the films listed, I would make up a new, more representative horror top 50. Well, the results proved that HALLOWEEN is still the best horror film in the opinion of many many fans. A great achievement if you know the runner ups were absolute classics like Psycho and the Exorcist to name only a few. And that's more than right, I think. 25 years after its release this film still is the ultimate thrill. Michael Myers still has the power to scare the hell out of you. The horrible music, by director John Carpenter himself, still makes the hair on the back of your neck rise like nothing else does.I'm pretty sure everyone knows the story already. And yes, it IS the most simple and predictable story ever written. But so what. It works a whole lot better than many other 'intelligent' horror films so what the heck if it's a goofy story. A very disturbed child kills his sister at the age of six and is locked away under strong supervision since then. 15 years later, he escapes and returns to his hometown, Haddonfield. He sets his mind to a local babysitter and he starts to terrorize her and her friends. That's it. But it works on so many levels. If you don't like this film, fine. But at least you've got to admit the status this movie reached is very respectable. It was the inspiration to endless ( and inferior ) sequels, ripoffs etc. In fact the whole sub genre of slashers is based on this one film ! I'm sure it wasn't the first slasher film ever made, but it certainly was the most influential of them all. Now, 25 years later they're still making sequels to the original. I believe they've reached episode number 9 by now. None of them lives up to the original, of course, but Michael Myers has a lot of fans all over the world and because of that...he will never die !In conclusion, if you want 90 minutes of pure suspense : you can't ever go wrong with watching Halloween. With the right atmosphere ( lights out, the TV loud ) I assure you, you'll be scared as hell. Not only thriller fans enjoy this film. It also has a lot of extra values attached to it. For example when the credits say ' introducing Jamie Lee Curtis ' This film made her famous and now, 25 years later, she still stars in the sequels. Although, I don't really think she's the star of the series, actually. Michael Myers is in the first place of course. The actor who plays him doesn't have to say a word, but still he is always present. And secondly...Donald Pleasance. This great actor died in 1995, but he'll always live on through the countless amount of memorable roles he played. One of them is his character in Halloween. Dr. Sam Loomis...he'll play this role 4 more times. He appeared for the last time in Halloween 6: The curse of Michael Myers.",8,4,14,28 July 2003
Paths of Glory," Liberté, égalité, fraternité !
","Usually I don't comment or popular classics or war movies, but I absolutely wanted to leave a review for 'Paths of Glory' for two principal reasons. First, as a sort of small homage to Kirk Douglas. This great gentleman of Hollywood passed away early 2020 after reaching the more than respectable age of 103. Nevertheless, he will be sorely missed. Secondly, and most important, because not any other movie ever made comes even close to depicting the pure madness and hypocrisy of warfare as accurately and truthfully as Stanley Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory'. The three words in the subject line of this user-comment represent the widely known moto of the nation of France. Logically interpreted these words imply that all French people are free, equal and live in brotherhood. Well, this moto certainly wasn't yet put into practice during the horrible World War I. During the most shocking sequences, Kubrick masterfully juxtaposes the wealth and luxury of French military generals (fancily dining and waltzing with aristocratic ladies) versus the daily agony the 'ordinary' French soldiers are confronted with (suffering and dying in the trenches). These same hypocritic generals give the command for downright impossible attack raids, and then subsequently accuse their troops of cowardice and blame them for their own strategy-incompetence against - around that time - much better organized German army. Douglas impressively portrays the honorable Colonel (and attorney of law) Dax who puts his career and reputation at stake to defend a trio of soldiers put on trial 'as an example'.Powerful and extremely compelling war classic, based on a fantastic source novel, but brought to an even higher quality-level thanks to the meticulous directions of Stanley Kubrick and the dazzling performances of an all-star cast. The dialogues in the script are often astonishing and the atmosphere is so intense that you'll find yourself gasping for air. More than sixty years old, but still as effective and breath-taking as ever, 'Paths of Glory' is a cinematic classic in the purest definition of the term.",9,3,4,14 February 2020
Back to the Future Part II," Past, alternate present and future  In reverse order!
","'Back to the Future 2' is at least as engaging, entertaining and compelling as its predecessor, and that's already a praiseworthy accomplishment when dealing with sequels and/or second installments of a trilogy. Part two is perhaps slightly less regarded as a cinema classic than the 1985 original, but that's merely just because the surprise element has gone and because all the characters already feel familiar, as the screenplay is equally solid and eventful  arguably even more so. The story lines here are admittedly more hectic and convoluted, but returning director Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale never at one point lose their grip on the story that is literally stuffed with paradoxes, time loops, inside-jokes, subtle references to prequel and sequel, clever hidden trivia and accurate time details. The first film merely just featured one major journey through time, but the splendid DeLorean time machine sets off no less than three times now. Barely returned and recovered from his first time-traveling adventure, Marty as well as his girlfriend Jennifer get picked up by Doc Brown to prevent something from happening in the year 2015, before it tragically affects Marty's private family life. Everything goes more or less according to plan, except for the aging Biff Tannen  the McFly family eternal nemesis  borrowing the DeLorean and traveling back to 1955 to hand over an almanac with sports results to his younger self and give instructions on how to make easy millions. With the alternate 1985 being a hellish wasteland to return to, Doc and Marty have to go back to 1955 as well and prevent young Biff discovering the truth about the almanac he received from old Biff. Meanwhile, they have to pay close attention in order not to interfere with their other selves who're there to fulfill the mission narrated in part one. It's honestly far more complex to give a brief description of the synopsis than to actually watch the film, because then the whole story simply seems to unfold automatically. All the different and hugely diverse themes neatly merge together, as if the screenplay wrote itself! There are some mild changes in comparison with the original film  released four years earlier what a long waiting period that must have been for the impatient fans  like the absence of Crispin Glover as Marty's dad and Elizabeth Shue taking over the role of his girlfriend (and apparently future wife), but generally speaking the most vital aspects and cast members remained. The humor is still incredibly effective and the action sequences are impressively staged and performed, notably the final showdown between Biff and Marty in the tunnel. Obviously the story lines are more absurd, the plot twists more grotesque and the use of special effects more plentiful, but basically this still remains a Hollywood sequel and they simply have to be bigger, louder and extra spectacular. At least here it's never at the expense of ingenuity.",9,1,2,8 July 2008
Carrie," Our little girl is becoming a woman...and ONE of a kind !
","Spoilers AHOY !!!Carrie - the movie - belongs to the finest adaptations of a Stephen King novel. I never read the book ( I don't read at all, actually ) but I can't imagine King would have wanted his story to be shown otherwise. Brian DePalma creates a terrific atmosphere here and the tension is always present. This movie is unique in many points of view. It's a perfect combination of horror and drama elements and that's not an easy thing to do. If you add a very frightening musical score to that and acting performances that are pretty close to perfection, you get the kind of film that we like to call MASTERPIECES !!!The plot is pretty much the most original thing that ever came out of the pen of Stephen King. The life of a girl in her late teens, Carrie. She doesn't have any friends, she kept very close by her religious mother and most of all, she doesn't know anything about nature and growing up. When she gets her period for the first time, she's being laughed at in a very traumatic way. With the help of an understanding teacher and a few students with a good heart, Carrie is accepted at last and even invited for the senior prom ...But, just when she thinks her luck is turning, she faces the ultimate nighmare...Carrie is a whole of fascinating, memorable and even touching scenes. The whole opening scene takes your breath away and then I don't even mention the entire prom scene. Horror and suspense cinema as pure as it gets. The movie is totally carried - sorry for the inappropriate use of words - by the acting performances of Sissy Spacek ( Carrie ) and Piper Laurie ( Mrs. White - Carrie's mother ). They both were nominated for an Oscar. I don't know who won that year ( probably someone from the cast of Network ) but they didn't deserve it !! The Academy Award belonged to these ladies here, no doubt about that. Smaller roles by John Travolta and Nance Allen are great as well. Even William Katt did a great job here but his character looks too much like a sheep. Nice haircut dude, keep up the 70's spirit. Brian DePalma did some of his best work in the 70's and Carrie belongs to his highlights. He often gets accused of being a Hitchock imitator, but in this film he certainly proves that he can create a unique atmosphere all by himself.
It has to be said...Carrie has one negative aspect in my opinion. Although this is nobody's fault, I would have wished the movie to be a bit longer ( that's a comment I don't give very often ). Personally I would have loved to see a bit more background on Carrie's family situation and a better explanation of the telekinetic forces she has. Her whole mysterious powers come all of a sudden and maybe that is a bit of a shame. The supernatural elements in Carrie aren't stressed enough but that's just my opinion, of course.",8,2,7,17 October 2003
Blow," As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a...Drug Baron!
","Even though Blow isn't a great film, it has enough style and character to prove that director Ted Demme had a promising and fertile career lying ahead of him. Sadly, he passed away early 2002 due to a heart failure. Demme, who previously directed modest comedies such as 'The Ref' and 'Beautiful Girls' delivered his first (and immediately last) ambitious film: a long and detailed biography of George Jung who learned his fellow Americans to sniff cocaine. George Jung's life (and thus the film) was divided in two major chapters. After spending a childhood on the edge of poverty, adolescent George and his friend Tuna head for California where they become prominent marihuana-dealers. With the help of an entire crew he develops an ingenious plan to transport and sell pot from California to his home-state Massachusetts. After a first conviction and the painful loss of his girlfriend, Jung learns about the wonders of cocaine in prison. Immediately after his release he works his way up in the Columbian hard-drug circuit where he experiences financial successes, but even more emotional agony and physical devastation in the form of betrayal, drug-abuse and paranoia.Since the film follows Jung's life so strictly, the film often is somewhat boring and it suffers from a serious anti-climax. The last 45 minutes are, in fact, a giant moralistic 'crime doesn't pay' message. Jung's love for his little daughter is painfully exploited and the constant interactions with his father are little redundant. The atmosphere and structure of 'Blow' are heavily influenced by GoodFellas and  even though Demme intended to pay tribute to this film  it reflects itself more like being a cheap imitation of a classic milestone. Johnny Depp's voice-over guidance sounds exactly like Ray Liotta's in GoodFellas. Demme even cast Liotta as Jung's father and mentor. A direct reference to his pupil role in GoodFellas?? Blow contains too many dialogue and a little too less action and compelling aspects. It's not easy to deliver a top-efficient biography on film, but Blow nevertheless is a reasonable effort. Not exactly fit for repeated viewings but definitely worth checking out if you're interested by social issues, psychological portraits or just when you're a fan of Johnny Depp.",5,6,11,1 October 2004
1408," What do you want from me, evil mini-bar!?!
","I damn well realize that this isn't my most popular personal opinion, but yours truly always thought that Stephen King is incredibly overrated and often even balancing on the edge of being a plagiarist. The fact that so many of his novels/stories got turned into fantastic classic movies – horror or otherwise – is mainly the accomplishment of all the gifted directors that helmed the adaptations (Brian DePalma, Stanley Kubrick, Frank Darabont, Rob Reiner) rather than of King's own writing talents. This '1408' is based on a short story of his that probably not many people read, and the film oddly enough received positive reviews in the press and on the internet, although most of the praise once again went to the director (Mikael Hafström) and the cast (John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson). Many of my fellow reviewers also label this as one of the best supernatural/ghost stories of the past two decades, but according to me it's just another derivative, predictable and principally dull thriller. Cusack stars as Mike Enslin; a not-so successful (at least, judging by the upswing at his latest signing session) author specializing in debunking myths and folklore tales surrounding haunted mansions/hotels. Enslin is a skeptic drunk and when he receives an anonymous letter daring him to overnight in room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York, he doesn't see much of a challenge. Hotel manager Gerald Olin (Sam. L) still attempts to discourage Enslin by reciting a bunch of horrendous events that occurred in room 1408 as well as by stating that the room is just plain evil, but the stubborn writer obviously won't listen. He soon discovers that there is something very wrong with room 1408, but it's not the type of location that is haunted by the restless ghosts of deceased tenants It's more like the type of haunted location that confronts the victims with his/her own inner demons; in case of Mike Enslin the unprocessed death of his daughter and the fact that he cowardly abandoned his wife. So, we have the story of a mentally unstable guy who gets isolated in a freaky hotel Now where have we seen that before? Yes, Stephen King is nowadays even copycatting himself since '1408' is often similar to 'The Shining'. '1408' is definitely watchable, and Cusack gives a powerful one-man performance, but the film is too predictable and containing far too many imbecilic sequences, like for example when Mike Enslin is hysterically shouting at the mini-bar.",4,2,3,14 February 2016
The Woman in Black," Graduated 'Cum Laude' from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft; now onwards to mature Gothic horror?
","Unfortunately I didn't manage to see the obscure 1989 version of the same story prior to watching this multi-budgeted and heavily marketed version at the cinema. That film, although a modest TV-production, is allegedly an atmospheric and creepy, yet sadly neglected gem of British horror that brings full and proper homage to Susan Hill's novel. I'm actually willing to believe that 'The Woman in Black' has more impact in a modest TV-format because it's (and I certainly don't mean any disrespect) a rather simplistic and lightweight ghost story. The concept is chilling and unsettling, but not particularly innovative, so director James Watkins (who put himself on the horror map with the grisly shocker 'Eden Lake') tries to impress the demanding nowadays audience with advanced digital effects, a detailed recreation of the Victorian era and the casting of the immensely popular Daniel Radcliffe in his first lead role after the 'Harry Potter' cycle. Radcliff depicts Arthur Kipps; a notary clerk still mourning over his lost wife who died four years ago whilst giving birth to their son. Kipps is sent to a remote and extremely superstitious little village to collect all the required documents to establish the final testament of a deceased Aristocrat lady. Her mansion is located in the middle of a swamp, only accessible via a road during low tide, and avoided by the locals because of a curse. They believe the swamp house is still haunted by the woman in black. According to the legend this restless spirit was once forced to give up her child due to poverty, yet the wealthy foster parents didn't take proper responsibility and they boy drowned in the swamp. Now, whenever someone witnesses the mourning lady in black standing in the cemetery, a random and innocent child will die. When a young girl does, in fact, die shortly after Kipp's arrival, the entire town aggressively turns against him. The premise of a ghostly apparition endlessly avenging his/her own unprocessed trauma is efficient but, as said already, not exactly original. Regardless of what point we are in the movie, you can always predict what will happen next. Of course the life of Kipp's own son will be at stake, and of course he will (fruitless) attempt to set right the mistake of others in the past. Furthermore, and this is a rookie mistake I didn't expect from James Watkins, 'The Woman in Black' really goes overkill with the false scares and misleading jump-moments. For nearly three quarters of the running time, the script simply goes 'boo!' through suddenly appearing faces and birds unexpectedly flying out of chimneys. Luckily enough I can confidently state that the budget got well spent. The decors, costumes and set pieces look astounding and the whole film is actually a respectful tribute to British horror of the 1960's and 1970's, particularly Hammer films who are making a comeback and co-produced this one! And, definitely worth mentioning as well, Daniel Radcliff's performance is stellar. With a few more mature and versatile roles like this on his repertoire, he might be able to wash off his cherubic Harry Potter image after all.",5,1,2,19 March 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Everything you could possibly look for in cinema!
","To keep up the goody goody cannibal spirit: 'Silence of the Lambs' is a finger-licking GREAT thriller and one of the most righteous Academy Award winners in the history of cinema. Maybe I'm just saying that because I'm a big fan of nerve-racking thrillers and, let's face it, nerve-racking thrillers hardly ever win any Oscars, but apparently all audiences as well as all critics seem to agree that 'Silence of the Lambs' is the worthy conquerer of 5 awards in the most eminent categories. The foundations of this cinematic milestone couldn't have been better, of course, with Thomas Harris' intriguing characterizations and basic story-idea (the efficiency was already proved in 1986, with 'Manhunter') but really a lot of the film's brilliance is added by the Jonathan Demme and his outstanding cast. Despite not having directed a lot of horror/thriller films before this, Demme's knowledge of the genres is impressive and he terrifically manages to bring a constant level of tension without ever resorting to graphic violence or explicit gore. And that's quite an accomplishment because, primarily, 'The Silence of the Lambs' handles about a sadistic serial killer, who eats his victims, who's recruited to assist in catching another sadistic serial killer, who skins his victims! Young FBI-trainee Clarice Starling is sent to Dr. Hannibal Lector's isolated prison cell to profile the new killer Buffalo Bill. But the highly intelligent and sophisticated Lector is only prepared to reveal clues about Buffalo Bill's modus operandi in exchange for answers to personal questions regarding Clarice's childhood.Apart from being a truly exciting and rather educational serial-killer chase, 'The Silence of the Lambs' also definitely is a compelling psychological drama-triumph! The 'Quid Pro Quo' conversations between Clarice and Dr. Lector are portrayed like highly competitive duels in which the young FBI agent isn't necessarily the weakest party! These conversations revolve on how determined both of them are willing to go in order to find out what they need to know and, simultaneously, we get to know how vulnerable Clarice actually is. These marvelous sequences appear to be even stronger thanks to the genuinely eerie and cold setting of Hannibal Lector's old, windowless cell. The camera perspectives throughout the whole film, as well as the cinematography in general, are impeccable and often trend-setting! Particularly classic is the 'parallel' climax, which actually is a ridiculously simple and misleading trick but increases the suspense to an unprecedented high point. And then, of course, there are the acting performances but what praise can I possibly add that hasn't been said before? Anthony Hopkins is in one word hypnotic, Jodie Foster is pragmatic but truly overpowering and Ted Levine is genuinely terrifying as the personification of human complexity!",10,4,12,10 January 2006
Blade Runner," The Future is mean, ugly...and rather dull.
","Well, I guess I must have totally missed the point again... I did not see a Sci-Fi masterpiece with astonishingly progressive visual effects and a flawlessly adapted screenplay, but an over-ambitious and difficult to digest drama epic with a lack of action. But hey, 'Blade Runner' is ranked pretty high in the IMDb top 250 and all the professional reviews are singing praise, so my humble opinion is probably something you shouldn't bother to read. Although, for the record, the only version I've seen is the original theatrical version and  supposedly  only the 1992 director's cut version is a genuine masterpiece. Unquestionably terrific is Ridley Scott's portrayal of our world by the year 2019, when the cities look exactly like predicted in Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' with immense 300-storey skyscrapers and pure decay down below on the streets. The future is ugly and petrifying and it looks like nobody can smile anymore. In this sad and unappealing universe, Rick Deckard is an early retired 'Blade Runner' whose duty was to eliminate android fugitives, called Replicants, that escaped from extraterrestrial colonies. Deckard is called back because four of the most dangerous Replicants are on an earthly mission to increase their miserable life-span of only four years. The film's biggest disappointment  other than the tiresome voice over by Ford and the dreadful jazzy soundtrack  are the characterizations of these android Replicants. Supposedly they're relentless villains that already made over 30 casualties on their way over to earth, yet when they're face to face with their enemies  humans  they don't look the least bit menacing or dangerous at all! Neither do they evoke feeling of understanding or sympathy, they just behave like philosophical talkers; especially the 'leader' Roy Batty. The love-story sequences between Ford and robotic beauty Sean Young feel like pure melodramatic padding whereas sublime actors in intriguing supportive roles (M. Emmet Walsh, Edward James Olmos) are criminally underused. The film may be rich on themes and symbolism, but the lack of excitement is saddening and the ending is unforgivably weak.",4,5,22,21 May 2006
Identity," Who'll stop the rain ?
","Every week, I read two movie magazines. When it comes to new movies, they mostly agree in their reviews. Except for Identity! One magazine said it was really good and filled with pleasant surprises. The other one said it was dull and rather predictable. This really meant I HAD to see this one. I finally did now and I must say I tend to agree with both my magazines. It sure had its predictable moments but that didn't spoil the fun for me. And it's one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. SPOILERS MAY APPEAR FROM HERE!!!! WATCH OUT WHAT YOU READ !!!Now, this is hard to explain but Identity is predictable while it's surprising. The whole 'motel-mystery' has its flaws and it's overall predictable indeed. But inside this story, there are still a few pleasant surprises to discover. SUPER SPOILERS HERE!!! Come on, of all people who claim they saw right through the plot...who can honestly say they suspected Ray Liotta to be an escaped villain ?? Or that Larry wasn't the real motel owner ?? END SUPER SPOILERS ! ( still small spoilers, though ) All people who claimed they fully figured this movie out after half an hour are lying. Even if they did have a good idea about the motel thing ( as did I, by the way ), I suspect they were still stunned by the whole wraparound story. You have to be pretty psycho yourself if you understood this from the beginning. So, in general, a very good story and a nice change in the average supernatural thrillers we get nowadays. END SPOILERS !!!Now for my favorite part of Identity. The flawless cast. Allow me to start with the side characters which were still played by known and very decent actors. John C. McGinley for example. Ever since Platoon and Wall Street I thought this guy was a very good actor but he never seemed to broke through. That's a shame because he truely is underrated. Clea DuVall is also in this movie. Whatever happened to her? I really thought she would become a great actress real soon but she still has to be satisfied with smaller roles. She isn't really cute but she's a damn good actress. One of the best in her young generation. Jake Busey is always a pleasure to watch. He sort of repeats the role he had in the Frighteners and this fits him very well. The leading actors are just great. Ray Liotta has always been a favorite of mine he proved again that he is worth this status. Never a bad word about John Cusack neither. He's outstanding as usual. In fact, I think it's his third best role next to Pushing Tin and Grosse Point Blank. I enjoyed Con Air as well, but I hope he never tries to be an action hero again. Intelligent comedies or psychological stories fit him better, in my opinion. I don't really care for Amanda Peet, but I guess she did a good job. At least, she was less annoying than in The Whole Nine Yards.The whole setting reminded me of Alfred Hitchkock's masterpiece PSYCHO. Only this manager is more funny than Norman Bates. Psycho proved that it's possible to create a unique atmosphere in an abandoned motel but furthermore there are few relations between these two movies. The constant rain contributes as well to this great setting. Well made, more than enough suspense, great acting and tones of creepy sequences. That's really all I can say about it. Oh, I can say I fully figured out the Sixth Sense when I first saw that one but NOT Identity...I guess that's a good sign.",7,1,3,23 September 2003
Amélie," The 'magic' of this one is completely lost on me...
","'Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' was on my 'avoid like the plague'-list ever since it got released. Just because I know for a fact that I don't like stuff like this and everybody else DOES. And if I share my opinion on it then, everybody hates me... And I hate it when I'm right. It was on TV recently and while everyone praised it...I was forcing myself not to moan too loud.Nevertheless, I can't be too harsh. I'm the first to admit that Amélie has several good and refreshing elements in it. But those are just the details of the story and the side aspects of the characters. The complete plot and moral of this movie is crap in my opinion. Just another feelgood movie that tries to convince people that life is - in fact - beautiful and a terrible thing to waste. If you look beyond the lovely settings and the adorable portrayal of Amélie, it's just another dull mixture of love, sentiment and relationships. Predictable and everlasting... On the other hand, if you're a fan of innovating and original cinema, you could see this movie as a satisfying experience. Like I said before, several small aspects in this movie are very pleasing and sometimes even brilliant. The style of the voice over, for example, is a real plus. A solid male voice brightens up the story, constantly using the same type of voice. The seriousness of his voice is really funny and the useless stuff he explains is really intriguing. Also, every personality that walks through the screen has his own strange characteristics and it's a real joy to discover them all. In my opinion, these are the only few points that makes this movie worth looking at.
In conclusion...I'm not at all saying that Amélie is overrated. Because - let's be honest - how can you overrate a movie that has been made with a limited budget and an overload of goodwill and creativity ? But it certainly is overhyped !! Basically, it's only stuff that lonely housewives and teenagers with a broken heart dig. Explorers of special cinema will like it up till a certain level, but that's it...",Null,3,12,18 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The next generation Star Wars is Fan-Tastic!
","One can only have deep respect and admiration for a genius individual like J.J. Abrams I think one of the most difficult things to accomplish in the film industry is to revive a legendary and immeasurably popular franchise, but Abrams achieved in doing so not just once – with 'Star Trek' – but now twice, with the even more astounding new 'Star Wars' installment. 'Star Trek' and 'Star Wars' aren't just your average type of successful Sci-Fi movies, no, they became so humongous that they became immortal cult phenomena with millions of obsessive fans, countless of spin-offs and imitations and merchandising business that started to lead a life of their own. In order to appeal to this many skeptical and demanding fans, your film just has to be really, REALLY good! 'Episode VII: The Force Awakens' is a fantastic film, and even though I'm not an avid 'Star Wars' admirer, it was the first one since 'The Empire Strikes Back' that truly impressed and overwhelmed me. Episodes I, II and III, that were released between 1999 and 2005 and directed by George Lucas himself, were not exactly worshiped by the die-hard SW-fans. Arguably that's because Mr. Lucas wrote and directed the prequels from a creator's point of view and not enough from a fan-boy's perspective. Abrams clearly is a big fan of the saga and probably knows more about Lucas' creation than he does himself, and that makes him the ideal person to helm the next generation of Star Wars cinema. 'The Force Awakens' has a solid and absorbing scenario, breathtaking decors and set-pieces, spectacular action scenes (brought to an even higher level of awesomeness thanks to the exquisite 3D) and – perhaps the most important of all – a truly excellent and versatile cast of characters. First and foremost there's the return of some legendary heroes, of course, like Han Solo and Chewbacca, but also the newly introduced protagonists are fascinating characters. Personally, I've always been most attracted to the Dark Side, so I adored the new and powerful foe Kylo Ren (and particularly his private mental battle), the relentless army General Hux and the rather disturbing Supreme Leader Snoke. But also the good guys are extremely likable, like tough girl Rey and the reshaped Stormtrooper Finn. I can't wait for episodes 8 and 9!",9,19,75,31 December 2015
Final Destination," the worst possible villain...death himself !
","Movies that scare you are rare these days. Some of the old classics like The Exorcist, Repulsion or Rosemary's Baby managed to make you shiver but when a nowadays horror film can frighten you, it's actually quite an achievement to itself. In fact, it's not the movie itself that is creepy but the whole idea behind it really gives you goosebumps. Alex and his class are going to France for a workweek. Many little signs make Alex afraid and a vision right before take-off makes him cause a scene. He and 5 others are thrown off the plane. While they're fighting in the lobby the plane explodes and all 287 passengers die. At that point you might think they're the luckiest people alive but...think again. They all start to die in the order they were supposed to die on the exploding plane. Why ?? Because Death had planned it that way. And there's no way you can escape your destiny. Alex starts to realize tries and tries to beat death again for himself and all the other survivors. Because he gets these little clues about what's gonna happen, he's always one step ahead... The first hour of this film is really good. The tension is built up efficiently and you just stare at it with your mouth wide open. You really awaits what will gonna happen next. The big advantage of this film is that it actually has no heroes. You have the feeling all the characters can die any minute. After this first astonishing hour, it all gets wasted a little. There are a little too many 'miraculous escapes' to keep you alert. That's a damn shame cause you really get the feeling the makers could have provided this film with a better ending. Yet, no worries because by then the film proved itself already as highlight of the new generation of horror. For the rest: there's a good amount of violence, blood and gore so even the fans of that are satisfied. The cast does well actually. Most of them made some fame by now but when this film came out they were all rather new in the field. Except for Tony Todd of course. Mr Candyman is a great casting choice!!! His eerie appearance and his spooky voice make the hairs on the back of your neck rise",6,3,5,26 June 2003
Rear Window," I spy, with my little eye, the most overrated Alfred Hitchcock thriller.
","This is likely to go down as the least popular user-comment in history, but then so be it. I believe in honesty and freedom of speech. Although universally considered as one of the top three (or maybe top five) best thrillers that Alfred Hitchcock made in his lengthy and undeniably brilliant career, I personally feel that 'Rear Window' is the most overrated movie of all times and I sincerely can't fathom why it's such a cinematic landmark. I reckon that the basic plot idea is utmost intriguing and that it's rather inventive how the cameras film literally everything from within the same secluded living room location, but that about sums up all the film's strengths. The narcistic photographer L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) sits immobilized in his apartment, bound to both a wheelchair and a humongous plaster cast around his leg ever since he took too much risk during a photo shoot on a racetrack. Purely out of boredom, he begins to watch all his neighbors across the little cement garden. The watching quickly turns into observing with binoculars and then into spying with his most professional & strongest photo lenses. He then thinks he witnesses a middle-aged man murdering his wife in cold blood, but a befriended police inspector, his lovely girlfriend and even his nosy housekeeper have trouble believing him. I was particularly annoyed by the behavior and ignorance of the protagonist. Jeff is supposed to be an intelligent person, so he must understand or at least respect that the police can't just go invading someone's private property and interrogate them about a possibly felony for which there isn't any evidence. The entire film evidently revolves on L.B. Jefferies' arrogant persona, and of course it doesn't help that I never really liked the actor James Stewart. I can appreciate him when his characters aren't omnipresent, like in Hitchcock's 'Rope' for example, but here he was rapidly getting on my nerves. The other characters, including Grace Kelly who never looked prettier, are downgraded to mere extras. I am also aware that practically every review praises that the powerful impact of 'Rear Window' lies in the fact that it's a statement on the human towards voyeurism and blah blah, but to me a film has to be entertaining and plausible first and foremost. 'Read Window' along with 'Vertigo' and 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' made me realize that can't get into Hitch's espionage or 'wrong-man-condemned' thrillers, and that I find his more polished thrillers extremely boring, unrealistic and overrated. I'm primarily a horror fanatic, and thus love the nasty Hitchcock films the most, like 'Psycho', 'Shadow of a Doubt', 'Rope' and 'Frenzy'.",4,4,7,7 February 2018
The Purge," USA 2022: To Protect and To Purge
","Among many other things, I have a weakness for dystopian Sci- Fi/action movies, and I'm also the type of geek who likes to philosophy and discuss whether or not the dystopian perspectives could work for real. James DeMonaco's 'The Purge' starts off with a killer – pun intended – premise: in the United States of the year 2022, not that far ahead of us in other words, all types of crime are legalized during a 12 hour period on the 22nd of March. During this so-called purge-night, hospital emergency services shut down, the police and fire departments don't respond to any calls and you can commit literally every horrendous crime – including rape or murder – without having to bear the consequences. According to the script the impact of the annual purge is enough to keep America crime-free for the rest of year, and it even stimulates economic growth and a decrease of unemployment rates! Interesting enough concept, but the skeptical geek in me seriously doubts that one wildcard-night is sufficient to compensate for 364 days of peace and welfare. Sour critics also proclaim that 'The Purge' is a typical American movie because a very large share of the population is pro- war, in favor of possessing weapons and in favor of unlimited defense of own property. Okay, maybe this partially explains the film's gigantic box-office success, but I don't want to rant about political undertones and, besides, the parody aspects are a lot more interesting. In a relatively short period of time, the infamous purge night turned into a kind of festive national holiday, like Halloween or Thanksgiving, and the people are joyously sharing their purging plans via radio shows or shamelessly sharpen their machetes in their front garden! The story centers on the wealthy Sandin family who are living in a fancy residential area in the suburbs. James Sandin got filthy rich selling hi-tech alarm systems and supports the purge, but he and his family nevertheless choose not to participate in the violence. When the eerie siren rings to announce the commencing of purge night, James hermetically seals off the house and plans to watch a movie with the kids. His dumb son Charlie ruins it for the whole family, though, as he opens the door for a hysterical man on the run for a bunch of frantic 'purgers'. Their leader then sets an ultimatum for the Sandins: hand over the stranger or everyone gets killed. In spite of its innovative premise and enormous possibilities, 'The Purge' rather quickly turns into an ordinary slasher/vigilante thriller with nasty executions and lunatic characters. The masks of the attackers are inarguably horrifying, but the authentic ear-to-ear smile of leader of the pack when he looks straight into the intercom camera is conceivably even more disturbing! 'The Purge' certainly isn't a great film or even a notable highlight in the genre, but it's at least entertaining and I wouldn't even mind watching the two sequels it already spawned in the meantime.",5,0,2,27 April 2016
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A landmark in Horror
","One of the most popular horror films ever made. After nearly 20 years it still scares the hell out of you. *SPOILERS* : Panic breaks out under a group of teenagers when they find out they all have the same nightmares. They all dream about an awfully mutilated man with a disturbing red 'n green sweater and knives for fingers. Tina is the first to die, she gets cut in her dream but keeps on bleeding when her boyfriend wakes her up. Tina's best friend Nancy seems to be the main target now. She realizes this and doesn't dare to go to sleep. When she does, she haves fights with the guy and gets hurt. Then she finds out who this maniac killer is. His name is Fred Krueger and her mother tells her he used to be a child killer. He escaped his punishment and the parents took the law in their own hands. They set fire to his shed and he burned to death. It seems now that he's back where the parents can't protect their children..in their dreams. Nancy realizes that Fred is too powerful in her mind so she comes up with a plan to bring him out with her when she awakes. That way, he can be beaten, she thinks...Starting from the opening credits, you just know this is gonna be great horror. With very scary theme music in the background, you see a mutilated pair of hands create a glove with sharp knives attached to it. This movie has got everything it needs: teenagers you don't care whether they live or die, a horrifying maniac and great make up effects. This original, written and directed by Wes Craven, got a lot of sequels. Some of them were really enjoyable, some of them were pure crap but nothing beats this first one. Also very memorable: when the opening credits say : 'introducing Johnny Depp'",8,5,10,19 May 2003
What We Do in the Shadows," The 2nd vampire mockumentary
","I certainly don't intend to bash or talk too negatively about 'What we do in the Shadows', but to all those die-hard fans who claim that it's a super-original, refreshing and inventive horror comedy I would just like to state clear that the exact same idea and concept had already been done before, namely in the sadly unknown but definitely worthwhile Belgian sleeper hit 'Vampires' (Vincent Lanoo – 2010). In that film, which was basically a spoof/homage towards the legendary Belgian cult classic 'Man Bites Dog', a TV crew gets the assignment of following around a family of vampires and shoot a documentary about their lives, habits and routines. 'What we do in the Shadows' is identical, in fact, except that the action takes place in New Zealand instead of Belgium and that the vampires are not related to each other but house mates that originate from different historic eras. Viago is nearly 320 years old, Deacon almost 200 and Vladislav over 800. They share a little student flat in the center of Wellington and encounter daily issues, like whose turn is it for doing the dishes or who spilled human blood all over the floor. Oh, there's also an 8000-year-old Nosferatu look-alike named Petyr living in the attic! Most of the comic situations are related to the gigantic generational differences between them, especially when they reluctantly 'welcome' the brand new vampire Nick in their midst. Nick doesn't really bother to keep his vampirism secret, but he does introduce the rest of them to interesting new technologies (like sunset videos on You Tube) and provides them access to hipster nightclubs. The humor in 'What we do in the Shadows' is subdued and dry. Very, very dry In fact, the film works best as a pitch-black satire of the recent trend of 'polished' vampire movie franchises and TV-series like the 'Twilight Saga' or 'True Blood'. The vampires here are not stylish or attractive – quite the contrary - and there's absolutely nothing sensual about being bitten in the neck; especially when the victim's artery paints the entire room blood red. Definitely not all gags or puns are equally successful, but some ideas are extremely inventive and even downright brilliant, notably the nightly confrontation with the werewolf pack and all sequences involving Petyr. Recommended, but – please – make an effort to also check out the aforementioned Belgian pathfinder flick 'Vampires'.",7,1,2,1 December 2015
The Replacements," The ideal 'sit back and relax'-comedy
","I think it's pretty obvious you don't have to choose The Replacements if you're interested in seeing a unique and/or innovating cinema experience. The Replacements perfectly delivers what you expect...A good hour and a half of pure fun and laughs. It's a delightful little comedy with decent acting performances, hilarious situations and terrific quote material. The film uses all the typical clichés and about every character is stereotypical, but maybe that's the charm of it all. We get to see a textbook Sumo-wrestler, a blond cheerleader who can't even spell right and even the vulgar Welsh guy who smokes and curses on the field. The script is so utterly predictable and the feel-good message is shoved down your throat shamelessly, but still you can't resist to keep watching. There's a terrific light-hearted atmosphere hanging around the entire movie and sometimes, that's just all it takes to be satisfied with a movie. Keanu Reeves is a heck of lot more watchable in these type of comedies than he is as an action hero and Gene Hackman is great as usual. Even though he's clearly directing on automatic pilot, he never fails to impress. There are also good side roles by Jon Favreau, Orlando Jones, Rhys Ifans and even Art LaFleur ( it's been a while since I last saw him ).Naturally, the good guys win from the arrogant bullies, the development of the love-story was unavoidable as well and the use of typical Football-songs - like Rock 'N Roll part 2 - bring a smile to your face. The Replacements is the kind of movie that requires a few beers and popcorn...than you've got yourself a good old-fashioned brainless viewing.",6,2,4,19 January 2004
300," 300 against millions I like these odds!
","First and foremost, '300' sadly is one of them films for which all the highlights already featured in the trailer. All of Gerard Butler's aggressive speeches ('Madness? This...is...Sparta!' or 'Spartans, tonight we dine in hell!'), and all the Spartans' monstrous opponents simply aren't exciting anymore, since theaters have been playing the trailer since December 2006 already. Sure there are other encouragement speeches and other, less extravagant enemies to battle, but it's all pretty tame compared with what the trailer promised us. This is rather unacceptable for a hugely promoted epic blockbuster like '300'. Cinematic events like this should be a non-stop series of excitement, spectacle and they should feature so much action it couldn't possibly fit in one trailer. Mel Gibson's 'Apocalypto', for example, was a film that featured a constant level of adrenalin-rushing footage, and the trailer only served as an appetizer. Other than that, '300' is a pretty remarkable and visually impressive movie that'll certainly appeal to all fans of savage macho-behavior and slow-motion dismemberment sequences. Hollywood recently discovered a new prodigy and they're already exploiting all of his works. The unique style and giant success of Frank Miller's 'Sin City' immediately resulted in a screenplay-adaptation of the man's other graphic novel '300', which revolves on the historical battle of Thermopylae, where a small army of 300 Spartan warriors defended their land and heritage against literally millions of Persian soldiers under the command of the greedy and self-declared demigod Xerxes. The Spartan king Leonidas encourages his troops, who were all raised as relentless fighting-machines, never to surrender and to give their lives for Sparta. Even though is a thoroughly unfair battle, Leonidas and his men nonetheless manage to seriously deplete Xerxes' armies. I don't suppose Frank Miller's outrageous depiction of this battle counts as an accurate history lesson  unless the Persians really did recruit mutated monsters and giants as soldiers  but it's a vivid image of ancient barbaric warfare. Fans of shiny biceps, muscled torsos and really loud yelling will have the time of their lives and they certainly don't have to bother about the racist portrayal of literally every country that isn't Greek. Exactly like in 'Sin City', the actors simply had to pretend to fight in front of blue screens and the decors as well as the scenery only got added afterwards. It seems like this is becoming a new trend in cinema, because it increases the idea of watching a comic book that comes to life. It's not very realistic or convincing, but it offers the special effects team a wonderful change to experiment with surreal and grotesque tableaux and optical illusions. '300' is pure testosterone-driven entertainment, you just know to look for intelligent dialogs in this film.",6,9,24,26 March 2007
Cube," Living In A Box.
","Okay, I agree with the majority of people around here in thinking that 'Cube' is a fairly intelligent and well-constructed Sci-Fi thriller, but did it REALLY deserve all the hype and exceptionally high ratings it received? Basically, it's only the conceptual design and claustrophobic atmosphere that are unique here, while the evolution of the characters and their behavior certainly isn't new. 'Cube' is not the first film that gathers different and seemly-unrelated characters in an unusual setting where it quickly becomes clear that not the location but their own personal difficulties and the urge for survival form the biggest danger. That's just stating the obvious. Force people to cooperate and depend on each other and bad things WILL happen, especially if the situation is life threatening. The whole success of reality-TV shows like 'Big Brother' is based on this concept! So by now you already know that the story of 'Cube' revolves on a group of people that wake up and find themselves trapped in a peculiar location. Six people, to be exact, with different backgrounds and occupations (a math student, a cop, a shrink, an architect, an autistic boy and a criminal) have to find their way out of a mathematical construction stuffed with codes and booby traps. Naturally, they're disorientatedÂ… Unaware of what they possibly could have done to deserve this test or who's the evil mastermind behind this. 'Cube' is a powerful motion picture with a truckload of tension, eeriness and ingenious camera-tricks. The budget obviously was very limited, but talented director like Vincenzo Natali largely compensates this by using simple eye-candy (the disturbing color shades!) and implementing psychological terror. Personally, I didn't understand one iota of all the mathematical mumbo-jumbo, but it was fascinating to listen to and it certainly kept me on the edge of my seat. Often read criticism goes out to the acting performances, but I thought they were very adequate, especially considering the faces were unfamiliar. Don't get your hopes up for a genuine and old-fashioned shock ending, though.",6,2,4,26 April 2006
Jackie Brown," Different kind of masterpiece from Tarantino.
","Okay, I have to admit I was one of those people who called 'Jackie Brown' a bad movie around the time of its release. I thought it was overlong, uninteresting, dull and not nearly containing enough violence and spectacular gimmicks. That has changed with a couple of repeated viewings over the years. Admittedly 'Jackie Brown' is an unusual film at first, especially when you expect to see another 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs', but Tarantino's versatile brilliance still quickly shows through the staggering dialogs and masterful character drawings. The script is an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel called 'Rum Punch'  and a very faithful one, I've heard  but the elaboration of the characters and creating the atmosphere of coolness is pure and genuine Tarantino. He squeezes the most out of his already super-talented cast members and, for once, also indicates the viewer right from the start that this will be a slow-paced and story-driven type of thriller this time. I'm usually not a fan of long movies but the two and a half hours of Jackie Brown always literally fly by, since it's a joy and pleasure to observe Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Michael Keaton and all the other cast members in the roles of their lives. Jackie Brown is a middle-aged airline stewardess working for a lousy minimum wage and making some extra cash on the side by smuggling for the relentless gun trader Ordell Robbie. When she gets caught, she and the charming bail bounder Max Cherry develop a plan where they play Ordell and his criminal posse against the tough cops led by special agent Ray Nicolette. Trust me, the plot is far more convoluted and extended than this and it's definitely worth discovering the details for yourself if you haven't already. Many fans and internet sources state that 'Jackie Brown' is one giant homage to the 'Blaxploitation' trend of the early 70's. Well, it's true... but only partially. The smooth atmosphere (with the awesome soul soundtrack) and decorative elements are definitely heavily influenced by this particular cinema trend (and of course the casting of Pam Grier and Sid Haig as well), but the actual story is far too sober and even too mature to be Blaxploitation. Tarantino for once didn't deliver a rough and provocatively violent film, but this different type of approach is definitely rewarding since he managed to make a different type of masterpiece: one with heart, beauty, intellect and passion.",9,2,5,30 September 2008
Sin City," There's a new, exhilarating cinematic hell... It's called Sin City, baby!
","Finally...the very first true cinema masterpiece of the new Millennium is a fact! From start to finish, 'Sin City' is a genuine mix of pitch-black poetry, horrific morbidity, classic film-noir atmosphere and groundbreaking new technologies. Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez literally bring the grim comic world to life and it feels like you're in the middle of the fog-enshrouded streets of a nightmarish place where the smell of villain-blood and old whiskey nearly makes you dizzy. The screenplay for this first 'Sin City'-adventure revolves on three anti-heroes, all of them entangled in their own personal and blood-soaking Odyssey: a fatigue cop who desperately wants to finish a politically dangerous case before retiring, a gruesomely deformed creep who violently wishes to avenge the death of the only girl who ever treated him with some affection and a hero wearing red sneakers who guards over the neighborhood prostitutes. Along the way, a seemly endless series of ingenious but utterly deranged characters are introduced, all of them extremely lethal and as eccentric as you never seen them before! The events shown on screen are incredibly sadistic and provocative (glorified sleaze, sick massacres, perversity, obscure bars and even an authentic case of cannibalism!) but made irresistibly beautiful by the acting performances and Miller's unequaled talent for melancholia and depression.So far, this also is the ONLY film that managed to convince me that working with new, expensive and digital effects doesn't automatically result in an overly fake and boisterous movie! The creative use of green screens provides the film with its unhinged film-noir touch, while the possibilities are left open for Rodriguez to experiment with color shades. The mini-explosions of color are far too intense to put into words: from the despicable yellowness of the mutated child molester to the unimaginably beautiful redness of the muse's dress. Even the slickest color-detail is praiseworthy, like for example Rutger Hauer's crystal-green eyes. I guess it's true after all: computerized visuals in cinema really can be a blessing...but it requires a gifted crew that wants to use it out of love for the story and not exclusively because it's easy and profitable.'Sin City' is a film of shocks and surprises. Most of the time, the shock and the surprises are subtly blend together! Who, for example, would think that popular but fragile idol-actors like Elijah Wood or Josh Hartnett could ever look so menacing? Or who ever thought that you could feel so much sympathy for an ugly misfit whose only joy in life is to kill and mutilate? To wrap it all up, 'Sin City' is an experience that totally messes up every world-perspective you ever had. This almost feels like a cinematic orgasm: amazingly sexy, exciting and too cool for words. Nearly every actor or actress that is part of this production seems to play the part of his/her career. I can't possibly mention the brilliance of all the separate performances, because then the review would be overly long and you would have nothing to discover for yourself. Just prepare yourself to see a lot of perplexing acting (and pay special attention to Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen and Jamie King!). My appreciation towards Robert Rodriguez is enormous. I already loved all his previous movies (except for the 'Spy Kids'-series, but I'm not in the target group of that, I suppose) but  after seeing this film  it almost looks like they all were just simple practice.... inferior and meaningless try-outs that slowly prepared him for his ultimate achievement in directing: Sin City! This production will probably never receive any proper praise or recognition from the so-called eminent critics or Academy Award juries but, really, who the hell cares?!? This is a cool film...a sexy film...a must-see film!",10,6,11,12 June 2005
The Cabin in the Woods," Another clichéd, conventional backwoods horror . Or perhaps not?
","The title, the setting, the casting of the young protagonists, the one-paragraph synopsis  All these aspects and more lead to suspect that 'Cabin in the Woods' is just another derivative backwoods horror flick like there are thirteen in a dozen. Five of the most stereotypical college students head out to a rotten cabin the deep forests for a weekend of booze, soft drugs and premarital sex. During the first evening already, they stumble upon a cellar full of mysterious old relics and – not so surprisingly – unleash a type of evil that relentlessly pursues and eliminates them one by one. Yes, admittedly, this does sound exactly like the plot of 'Evil Dead', so might this just be another passable and uninspired imitation of Sam Raimi's classic and a truckload of others? Oh hell no, because this is where the genius of writers/director Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard enters the scene. One brief look at the repertoires of both these men is enough to assume that they won't simply deliver such an inferior and unoriginal cinematic product. The aforementioned description may sound prototypic, but the opening sequence immediately state clear that the overall film certainly is not. 'The Cabin in the Woods' opens with two aging men in suits – wondrously depicted by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford – babbling about random irrelevant private stuff when all of a sudden and totally unexpectedly the title torpedoes onto the screen in giant red letters! Intro's like these make my mouth water, as you know you're about to witness something very unique and unconventional. The further interactions between these men, and apparently a fully structured prominent organization behind them, run parallel with the unsuspecting students' trip. They observe and manipulate their every move and even place wagers on how the quintet will respond to a next ordeal. Meanwhile, the script also exaggeratedly puts the emphasis on how clichéd the set up, in fact, is. Each character perfectly fits into a specific category of archetypes (the jock, the nice girl, the bimbo, the stoner and the black model student), they point out themselves that they're heading to an area geographically cut off from civilization and they encounter the obligatory foretelling freak at the last gas station. The bigger picture behind all this remains mysterious and only unfolds in very small bits. Of course I will not reveal the denouement here, but you can rest assured it's something entirely innovative and unpredictable (and this comment comes from someone who has seen more than 3.000 horror movies). To evoke even more curiosity, I will still add that whenever you *think* to have figured out what's going on, Whedon and Goddard slap you around the head with another ingenious gimmick, sub plot or piece of dialog. Even though the duo accomplished most of their previous successes in the fantasy & Sci-Fi genres ('The Avengers', 'Lost', 'Buffy: The Vampire Slayer'), they demonstrate great knowledge on horror classics as well. The similarities with 'The Evil Dead' are evident, but there are numerous other slick and witty references to genre milestones such as 'Hellraiser', 'Re-Animator' and 'Ringu'. Totally refreshing film!",7,1,4,23 May 2012
True Romance," 10 reasons to state this is one of the greatest movies ever!
","Sure, purely talking cinema, True Romance isn't the most perfect film ever made (it's not boring enough for that). But, when it comes to entertainment values and coolness, this motion picture yet has to find an equal. Any first viewing of True Romance will literally blow you away and repeated viewing will only prove that this is one mean, addictive film. Through the years, True Romance built up quite a status and it's immensely popular. Still, too often it's categorized as worthless violence and therefore I'll introduce to you 10 reasons why this film is just brilliant!1. True Romance was the first screenplay written by Quentin TarantinoNow, it's unquestionable that Tarantino is one of the most gifted writers in cinema ever and this first work of his excellently reflects his enthusiasm and talent. The protagonist  Clarence Worley  has a lot in common with Quentin's own personality and because of this; True Romance actually looks like one giant daydream/fantasy of an imaginative adolescent.2. The choice of Tony Scott as the director. Unlike Oliver Stone in Natural Born Killers, Scott didn't feel the need to oppress his own visual style in True Romance. Yet, he adds a little more flair than QT would himself, so what you get is some sort of explosive crossover between Reservoir Dogs and Top Gun. 3. The all-star Cast!!!! Man, would you look at that cast! Some of Hollywood's best performers of every generation are there. Some of them only have miniscule roles but their presence is an extra added value, anyway. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Brad Pitt, Michael Rapaport, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Victor Argo4. Every single personality in True Romance is adorably eccentric and worth analyzing. Clarence and Alabama are the 'good guys', yet they're pretty messed up in their heads themselves. Basically, every person in this film is a self-centered weirdo driven by mad thoughts and insanity. As a result of this, superb and colorful dialogues are overwhelming you. Excellent, first-class quote material.5. The romantic on screen chemistry between Clarence and AlabamaEven though the plot may seem extremely illogical and far-fetched, the love and devotion between these two feels sincere and intense. Their interactions and sexual escapades increase the viewer's involvement. 6. That one particular sequence Fans certainly will know what I'm talking about now! A tour-de-force between two of the talented actors ever, resulting in a breath-taking climax. Walken and Hopper's acting almost burns holes in your TV-screen and you can almost feel the cigarette smoke prickling in your eyes. Guided by chilling classical music and shot beyond perfection, this surely is one of most intense sequences ever caught on tape. 7. The trivia elements and references towards other films. QT is an absolute film geek and he terrifically inserts his passion in his script. In many of the dialogues, the characters (Clarence in particular) constantly refer to cinema milestones like Rio Bravo, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Dr. Zhivago. True Romance also is one giant tribute to the King of Rock 'n Roll himself as Clarence is a dedicated Elvis admirer.8. The Soundtrack! Tarantino films always have blasting soundtracks and True Romance isn't an exception. The main theme is a brilliant instrumental song by Hans Zimmer while the rest of the soundtrack mixes classic oldies and modern songs. 9. The coolness! Simply putthis just is one cool motion picture. Clarence Worley is cool! He drives a purple Cadillac, wears giant sunglasses and eats hamburgers right after killing a guy. That is COOL! The love of his life is equally cool. She's like the perfect woman who likes Kung-Fu movies, dresses sexy and really knows how to defend herself. When asked where to meet discretely, she playfully answers: 'in the roller coaster!' and that, my friend, is cool. 10. The violence! Last but certainly not leastaren't we all a little excited to see massive, grotesque violence? Qua violence, True Romance definitely overtrumps your wickedest expectations. The film contains multiple memorable action sequences and, just when you think you've seen it all, there comes the grand finale! The final sequence is one major adrenalin-rushing shootout, leaving very few to the imagination. Fascinatingly photographed and fun to see. There you go In case you haven't seen True Romance yet, I have no idea what else would convince you to see it. Changes are high this will be one of your personal favorites, for sure. There only is one little turnoff I should mention. True Romance recently got released on Special (double disc) Millennium edition but that was quite a disappointment. The extras don't really feature anything special. I was hoping to see some deleted scenes or something, but there only is a B-roll documentary and a couple of short interviews.",10,7,13,21 May 2004
Mad Max: Fury Road," Oh it's such a lovely day! I'm glad I spent it with Max!!
","I am honestly not that generous with my 10/10 ratings, I assure you, and yet this is the third film (out of four) in the 'Mad Max' franchise that I awarded with a well-deserved 10/10 rating! Next to the low-budgeted but tense and progressive 1979 original and the phenomenal 1981 'The Road Warrior', 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the third bona fide & unhinged masterpiece in the series. Only 'Mad Max beyond Thunderdome' I rated a little bit lower, due to a weaker second half, but even that one was highly enjoyable. All this makes 'Mad Max' one of the greatest – perhaps even THE greatest – movie franchises in history. It doesn't matter that this fourth installment only reaches us nearly three decades after the others, and it doesn't even matter that a new lead actor depicts the legendary titular character George Miller's dystopian post- apocalyptic world perspective is still 100% perplexing, adrenalin- rushing and mind-blowing! From start to finish, 'Fury Road' is a high-octane (pun intended) Sci-Fi/thriller adventure with nightmarish characters, dazzling stunt work, incredibly insane plot situations and – guaranteed – the most grotesquely imaginative set designs (vehicles, base camps, death traps) ever created. And you know what is the best part of this all? Almost everything in 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is real! By that I mean real stunt work with manually manufactured vehicles that are driven by real tough guys – and gals – in authentic desert locations, instead of computer engineered effects or cast members stupidly miming in front green screens. Lone drifter Max Rockatansky roams around in an uncivilized wasteland, regularly haunted by hallucinations featuring the restless spirits of his deceased wife and child, and gets captured by the minions of the tyrannical self-declared demigod Immortan Joe. This creepy dictator is about to be double-crossed by the rough gal Furiosa, who secretly hid Immortan Joe's beautiful 'breeding' girls in her massive fuel truck and plans to take them to the green oasis where she was born. Joe sends his War Boys after them, an army of sickly albino freaks that practically orgasm whenever Immortan Joe even looks at them. The most ambitious War Boy is Nux and he chases Furiosa with Max attached to him as a living blood bag! There are many sub plots, twists, turns and bizarre escalations, but they are all worth discovering. The most fantastic thing about 'Mad Max: Fury Road' are the downright marvelous vehicle-designs. I swear, the people who thought up and created the cars and trucks for this film are real geniuses for sure! There are trucks with the coachwork of Volkswagen Beetles, Monster trucks with old Mercedes coachwork processed into them, pick-ups with caterpillars, sand buggies covered with metal spikes and many, many more. Perhaps the craziest gimmick of them all is a War Boy with a rock guitar that is attached to a truck, and his only reason of existence is to incite the rest of the troops. The almighty George Miller also penned down some of the most nightmarish yet intriguing supportive characters, like Corpus Colossus (the deformed midget son of Immortan Joe), The People Eater (a creep that constantly rubs his own nibbles) and The Bullet Farmer. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is cinema in its purest form. See it! And don't just wait for the DVD or for the film to appear on Netflix or whatever. This is a film you have to experience at the cinema, on a gigantic screen with the best possible sound effects. Sheer brilliance",10,10,25,28 May 2015
Donnie Darko," '...and I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad' (Mad World)
","Richard Kelly's flawed but utterly promising debut is one of the best things that could happen to post 2000 cinema. In fact, I use the word 'flawed' with caution because it isn't the most appropriate term to describe the slight imperfections featuring in Donnie Darko. It feels a little like Kelly wants to add too many ingenious elements and gimmicks and the screenplay often is a little messy. Nevertheless, it's a project that breathes its own personal atmosphere and the creativity nearly drips from the screen. What makes this film so unique and fresh is the half-apocalyptic, half depressing tone. We're welcomed in a bitter 80's setting and meet Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) who's living in a socially strict suburban town called Middlesex. Donnie is a not-so typical teenager who suffers from severe hallucinations and bizarre states of mind. It even gets worse when he has a near death experience, as he starts spotting a giant ugly bunny that tells him the world is coming to an end. What follows is a blend of almost-brilliant sequences, an outstanding 80's soundtrack and slightly too many digital effects. That's not a bad thing, though, because you especially remember the good sequences like Donnie rebelling against his superficial teachers and hilarious Smurf-speeches. Jake Gyllenhaal is great and there are sublime supporting roles for Mary McDowell, Patrick Swayze and Holmes Osborne (he's the coolest father one could have). Special mention goes out to the gorgeous Maggie Gyllenhaal in her (too small) role of Donnie's sister Elizabeth. Richard Kelly has talent. That's not an opinion, that's a fact and even those who dislike this film should reckon this. Just look at how he pans the camera over the high school playground while 'Head over Heals' by Tears for Fears is playing. That's pure class!",9,2,8,27 October 2004
Back to the Future," Brilliant Scenario!
","Few things are as difficult to accomplish as a movie dealing with time-traveling. To take on themes as risky as paradoxes and time loops you primarily need a healthy dose of courage and ambition, but most importantly loads of writing talent and cinematic vision. The scenario of 'Back to the Future', courtesy of director Robert Zemeckis and co-producer Bob Gale, is honestly one of the most brilliant ones ever penned down and, thanks to the financial support of several acclaimed producers (including Steven Spielberg and Frank Marshall), it also became one of the most massively entertaining films of all time, with sublime special & sound effects, diversity of genres and some of the greatest casting choices and acting performances ever. 'Back to the Future' is quintessentially speaking a Sci-Fi comedy, but Robert Zemeckis admirably also hints at the more emotional and melodramatic aspects regarding time traveling. Also, even though the film boosts some of the greatest effects ever, their use merely remains functional and occasionally, so that the emphasis continuously lies on the story and the development of the characters instead of on flamboyant machinery and overlong speeches about scientific theories. The DeLorean is a stylish and original piece of scenery, but other than the fantastic and already legendary vehicle there are no giant laboratories with thousands of flickering lights. Marty McFly is a typical mid-80's teenager with a skateboard he knows how to use and a delightful high school sweetheart that loves him very much. His parents George and Lorraine, however, are a pitiable and hopelessly old-fashioned couple and thus he spends most of his free time with his genius but slightly eccentric friend Doc Brown. The latter invented a time-traveling device and, following a series of bizarre events, Marty accidentally travels back to 1955; the year his parents met and fell in love during the school prom. Marty has only one chance to return to the future, but in the meantime he has to correct the events he tampered with in order to save the future and even assure his own birth. The script is very well constructed and literally stuffed with witty little details that refer to earlier events and/or events that have yet to appear, either later in the film or even in one of the sequels. The humor works, the light-headed tone and atmosphere puts a big smile on your face, you come to care for the characters and the awesome soundtrack even makes it difficult to remain in your seat. Michael J. Fox, Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson all give away excellent performances, but my two preferred roles are for Christopher Lloyd (with his confused looks and bizarre facial expressions, he makes a superb mad scientist) and Crispin Glover. The latter appears to be born to depict weirdos and uncanny freaks, so the role of introvert and mysterious George McFly fits him perfectly.",10,4,5,29 June 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," Rockin' all over Europe!
","The Bourne Supremacy is a sequel to the remake of a TV-movie and based on a successful novel. On paper perhaps the worst possible idea imaginable, but on the screen a lot of old-fashioned action-entertainment. In the 2002's the Bourne Identity, we were introduced to Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, an ex CIA-agent suffering from amnesia. Many mean people tried to kill him but he managed to escape with a little help from Franka Potenta (Lola!) and her mini-Cooper. Jason is still on the run and evil Russians use his coordinates to sabotage a CIA mission in Berlin, Germany. Jason is p****d off (who wouldn't be?) and decides to dig up his past once and for all. Paul Greengrass managed to make a highly amusing film, using almost the entire European continent as his playground. It has tension, speed and oppressed humor while some of the technological gimmicks make you gasp! Matt Damon shines as Bourne again and he's the closest thing to an action-hero we've seen in a long time. He's everything a dull and routine hero is not! Confused, emotional, incognito and  most of all  unfunny! No lame one-liners here and that's a relief. Bourne's portrayal might as well be called the best aspect of the entire film. Recommended.",7,1,4,16 September 2004
Warm Bodies," A Zom-Rom-Com Do we really need those?
","I don't like zombie comedies, and I especially don't like zombie comedies in which the zombies can think, feel, talk or – god forbid – slowly transform back into human beings again! I often wonder how far nowadays directors can and will go exploiting the concept of zombie comedies even further. The days of George A. Romero's original zombie trilogy are long over and nail-biting suspense has gradually turned into absurd comedy and annoyingly ambitious story lines. The majority of zombie comedies are pretty lame, with some notable exceptions of movies that accomplished something particularly refreshing or innovative, like for example 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Fido' and 'Wasting Away'. 'Warm Bodies' is definitely also one of the more watchable zombie comedies out there, but this is merely thanks to the solid directing of Jonathan Levine and the excellent performances of Nicolas Hoult and Theresa Palmer, rather than to the dire and derivative subject matter. Following a not specifically mentioned type of catastrophe, 99% of the world's population turned into zombies while the last remaining human survivors entrench themselves in a fortress and listen to the orders of John Malkovich. But the shuffling zombies here are quite different than the usual type of braindead monsters, as they somehow still have remnants of emotions and intelligence left in them. The young R – he can't remember the rest of his name – lives at an airport where he cozily decorated his own private plane and he manages to contemplate about his life (or, better yet, his death) and even produce a few words. During one of his quests for human brains to feed on, R falls head over heels for the tough chick Julie. He munches Julie's boyfriend's brains – and memories – but rescues her and bonds with her in his airplane. Problem remains, of course, that R is a corpse and Julie is the daughter of the leader of the human resistance fighters. 'Warm Bodies' contains a handful of really good ideas and – it has to be said – R's monologues are extremely witty. It's hilarious to finally hear zombies say about themselves stuff like 'God, we move slow!' After an enjoyable first half, the film becomes dull and ordinary. The sequences with the skeletons or 'Bonies' (zombies in a final state of decay and completely devoid of emotions) are downright pathetic, because of the unfitting violent tone and the miserably bad CGI-effects. The fairy-tale climax is as soft and weak as you would expect from a zom-rom-com",4,2,6,4 November 2015
The Birds," Birds don't just go around attacking people, do they?
","I still have quite a few of Hitchcock classics to see, but I can already rest assured that 'The Birds' will remain my all-time favorite effort by this legendary director. Being primarily a horror movie junkie, I consider this milestone to be the pioneer in the delicious 'nature revolts' sub genre. For reasons that remain unexplained throughout the entire movie, birds spontaneously launch virulent and aggressive attacks against the inhabitants of Bodega Bay; a little seaside town 90 miles away from San Francisco. Still several years after the release of this film, clever and ingenious independent horror film directors borrowed this formula and used it as an excuse to manifest practically every species of the animal kingdom as vicious killing machines, usually because of the ongoing pollution by mankind. But 'The Birds' remains the original classic even though the story develops itself very slowly and the script refuses to give any type of explanation whatsoever. For nearly a full hour, the film simply focuses on the bizarre love-story between the spoiled daughter of newspaper owner and an arrogant crime attorney. She drives out to his parental house in Bodega Bay, where he spends all of his weekends, to play out a practical joke. 'The Birds' then subsequently unfolds itself as a strangely compelling romance between the two aforementioned characters, but also the embittered local school teacher and the attorney's frigid mother. The interactions between these four unusual characters are often downright eerie and there isn't even a bird in sight at that moment! Meanwhile, however, the menace of our 'feathered friends' is continuously present and noticeable. The attacks gradually increase in number and intensity, like the birds are putting up some sort of strategy even though there's no obvious motive. After the virulent attack during a child's birthday party, the thriller definitely shifts into high gear, with many sequences that are righteously considered as classic by now (the schoolyard, the phone booth, the exploding gas station). Hitch's nickname 'The Master of Suspense' is justified through many individual moments here in this film, like when the entire community seeks shelter inside the café and accuses the girl of bringing this mayhem upon them. The film's brilliant anti-climax, with thousands of birds just sitting and suspiciously waiting outside the Brenner house is legendary and imitated copious of times. 'The Birds' is a perplexing Hitchcock landmark, with a couple of surprisingly shocking make-up effects and a truly ominous atmosphere that still manages to send cold shivers of fright down your spine.",8,22,38,30 August 2009
Beetlejuice," Dead. And LOVING it!
","God knows many have tried, yet only ridiculously few filmmakers succeeded in bringing horror-comedies that are actually funny AND genuinely macabre at the same time! And yet, since the beginning of his career already, Tim Burton manages to pull this off seemly without the slightest bit of effort. 'Beetle Juice' in particular is the most spirited horror-comedy I ever saw and possibly even one of the best comedies of the entire 80's decade! It's an incredibly energetic movie, and you gladly allow the characters and situations to go immensely over-the-top. I don't know how he does it or what his secret is, but in a Tim Burton movie, there are equal amounts of devotion going out to the comedy aspects and the make-up effects! By the rather gruesome make-up art, you certainly can't derive that 'Beetle Juice' is also a light-headed comedy! The portrayal of the 'afterlife' is pretty eerie and notably the séance-sequence is quite frightening. Despite originally intended to be much more horrific, 'Beetle Juice' is definitely creepy at times. It often looks like an obscure comic book story that came to life! The happily married Maitlands  Alex Baldwin and Geena Davis - both pass away in a car accident but have to remain ghost-residents in their own house for another 125 years. This wouldn't be such a problem, if it weren't for the new owners, an eccentric New York family with the intention of giving the old-fashioned nest an avant-garde makeover. In order to scare them away, they might require the help of the too-much-too-handle bio exorcist Betelgeuse. This immediately turns out to be a bad idea, as Betelgeuse is an unscrupulous, boisterous and totally deranged lunatic. This crazy flick terrifically stood the test of time and still benefits from its great music and excellent acting performances. All the players are great, but obviously Michael Keaton will be remembered most for his sensational role as Betelgeuse. He swears, transforms into snake-like monsters, dances atop graves, visits miniature brothels and fires off some of the most comical one-liners in the history of cinema, including: 'Go ahead, make my Millennium' and 'I'm the ghost with the most, babe'. Thanks to him, you worry a lot less about having to die one day",9,1,3,14 July 2006
The Wizard of Oz," Go Dorothy, Go!!!
","The Wizard of Oz is probably the only film ever of which I think everybody should see it! Not one person on this planet has an acceptable excuse for skipping it if they have the change. Even after 65 whole years, the story and characters still look fresh and the breath-taking scenery still causes daydreaming. Dorothy's extraordinary journey in the Land of Oz is funny, touching, valuable and rhythmic! Even the overload of sentiment and moral doesn't bother me in this one. The story couldn't be more sappy or politically correct but I don't careit's a visual masterpiece for sure and the importance of this motion picture in the history of cinema is inescapably. The Wizard of Oz practically is a complete chapter of cinema-history itselfreferenced, spoofed and honored in numerous other titles. A must-see fairy-tale that'll escort you to an imaginative and colorful world where wondrous characters live, evil has to be fought and important life-lessons are educated. Preferably one to watch at very young age for the first timeyou'll never forget this movie! And now you're off  to see the Wizard!!",10,7,10,10 March 2004
Dodgeball," Go Team Slapstick!
","Once every few years, you're presented to a slapstick comedy so hilarious you instantly forget how LOW this form of entertainment actually is. I can't give a scientific explanation to state how come it's funny to see someone (preferably wearing glasses) getting hit in the face by a ballit just is. Dodgeball is vulgar, crude and without substancebut your stomach will hurt from laughing and don't we all need that from time to time? In case you really want to defend this film, you can always say it features tons of unsubtle criticism towards modern American image of exaggerated health-obsession. Ben Stiller's character is the personification of the obnoxious fitness guru: 'We're better than you, and we know it'. Opposed to him, there's Vince Vaughn as the chilled-minded, lovable guy who owns a fitness center for the underdeveloped wimps. Due to his financial situation, he risks losing his gym to Stiller except if he and his teams of misfits manage to win the world-famous dodgeball tournament. The film is a series of cheap chuckles, eccentric characters and outrageous one-liners. It's pretty funny to hear Stiller yell out lines like: 'You're a skid mark on the underpants of society'. Or the always-amusing Rip Torn encouraging his team with the words: 'you're as useful as a cock-flavored lollipop'. The acting is great as it can be with Ben Stiller and Rip Torn who go delightfully over the top and lots of enthusiast cameos (Chuck Norris, David Hasselhof, William Shatner and even Lance Armstrong). It sure isn't Schindler's List but Dodgball is great entertainment and stress releasing.",7,121,155,27 September 2004
Evil Dead II," Demented fun!
","Not so much of a sequel to Sam Raimi's groundbreaking horror feast the Evil Dead, this is more of a reprise of the same film with more proper equipment, professional pacing and further developed gore. Sole survivor Ash (Bruce Campbell in the role of his life) returns to the cabin in the haunted woods and faces the same demonic forces he dealt with in the first film. The first half is kind of like a one-man horror comedy show that provided Campbell with his constantly growing cult-icon status. Ash chops up his possessed girlfriend, loses essential body parts and nearly goes completely insane up in that shed. The second half introduces new characters or - in other words  fresh new victims to dissect. Sam Raimi updates his initial Evil Dead idea with rushing camera movements, inspired gore and comic book-style action. The pacing is fast and the blood is omnipresent! According to most horror fans, this is the finest installment in Raimi's trilogy (completed in 1993 with 'Army of Darkness') but I still prefer the charming cheapness of the original. Nevertheless, this is one outstanding horror adventure. Campbell's acting skills have remarkably improved and Sam Raimi's directing also is a lot more solid. Great fun, warmly recommended to every horror fan and admirers of twisted black humor.",7,29,46,29 November 2004
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The terrific odyssey of the Soggy Bottom Boys
","SPOILERS! The Coen brothers have done it again! In a time where cinematic art and inspiration never ceases to reach new lows, they manage to deliver extremely funny and original film adventures. With their amazing sense of subtle humor and their unique talent of storytelling, the bros present us yet another triumph in a complete series of highlights.  Not one film of the Coens fails to satisfy the audience and that makes them the greatest directors alive at the moment. O Brother Where Art Thou deserves most of its praising thanks to the sublime structure and the terrific atmosphere. The story takes plays in the depressing 30's and the rural way of living in this decade is transferred to the screen terrifically. A convicted prisoner escapes but he has to drag along two other (not so bright) prisoners because they're chained together. The makes them believe there is a buried treasure waiting for them if they stick together. They do find many adventures on their way indeedO Brother is filled with eccentric and hilarious personalities and each of them has a bunch of bizarre characteristics. Our three meet a lunatic bank robber who's merely looking for fame instead of fortune, a well mouthed Bible salesman who doesn't seem to be so religious after all, a threesome of wicked but lovely sirens, a guitar player who sold his soul to the devil and  top of the bill  they have to face an entire group of the Ku-Klux-Klan! The often melodramatic and depressing subjects are presented with an overload of humor and sarcasm, which makes the whole film very unique and typically Coen Brothers. The three heroes' even record their own hit and grow to be famous without even knowing it!! George Clooney gives away his best performance ever as Ulysess Everett McGillhis charismatic charm and sublime vocabulary fits this movie so well. John Turturro is a regular cast for the Coen brother and no doubt that he does his best work under them. Very good side roles for John Goodman and Holly Hunter (also frequently cast by the Coens) as well. In short, few movies come with such high recommendation as O Brother Where Art Thou. If you appreciate good cinema, you'll love this film. Just like all the Brother's movies by the way.",8,1,2,27 January 2004
