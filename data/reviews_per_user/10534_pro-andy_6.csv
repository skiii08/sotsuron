Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," just what I expected...
","An advantage with a film is not to know the plot from start to finish.  I mean, at least 99,9 % of those who watched the film knows that Anakin Skywalker will soon become the evil Darth Vader. I think that they have to do something different the next time and not think that the people will just come because of the first three parts. And i surely hope that Samuel L Jackson will be a bigger part of part 2. I think that Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson were the only good thing with this film.   The special-effects surely is great but you cant base the movies story on special-effects and I think that George Lucas is making these three extra-films to earn some fast money without thinking about the movies story or acting. Nathalie Portman is one of the worst actresses I´ve ever seen since Sophia Coppola in Godfather part 3, she is so wrong in the queen-role.  An actress like Christina Ricci would have been much more believable in such a important part, but I think that we just have to see Portman in two more films. And for heavens sake, dump C3PO and R2D2, they were almost funny in the first film from 1977 but since then they are... I cant find words for it...",5,0,1,5 January 2001
Forrest Gump," probably the best film ever
","the very touching story about Forrest Gump is in my eyes the best motion picture ever by 4 reasons.1. the story about Forrest journey down through the centuries is a wonderful story with loneliness, happiness and sadness. I dont think that any other movie can top that.2. tom hanks - this is his best part ever. i normally dont like hanks very much but this time i just cant say anything else than he was perfect in the part. only a young robert de niro could have done it this good, and perhaps not even him.3. the music - alan silvestris scores big time this time with his music. what more is there to say.4. gary sinise - my all-time favourite actor had his big breakthrough in this movie the same year as he did the mini-serie 'the stand' and he was this year nominated for the oscar fo this part. he is perfect as dan taylor and i think that he should have won the oscar.",10,1,4,13 January 2001
American Psycho," best film of 2000!!!
","wazup... i´ve been reading the book american psycho and was very happy when I first heard that it would be a movie based on the boojm and that Christan Bale was casted as Pat Bateman. Then I heard that Leonardo Dicaprio was casted and I almost fainted. He was not man enough to play a serial-killer with his baby-face. Then (thank god), Bale was again casted and the movie came out. First of all, I can only see 2 people do that part. 1. Christian Bale and 2. Christian Slater. They are both cool and can perform well in a part like that but I think that Christian Bale was perfect. My favourite scene was definitely when he played 'hip to be square' and killed Paul Allen with an axe in the livingroom and then smokes a cigarette with blood in his face. The movie is very hard to explain since it is a story of a very strange man :-) But I think that the movie was even better than the book, which I thought wasn´t possible. Willem Dafoes part seems to have been cut down and that´s perhaps the only reason why I does not give it a 10... Best film of 2000!!! 9/10      andy olzon",9,1,2,18 January 2001
Saving Private Ryan," Good but not an Oscar-winner...
","If this movie wins the Oscar for best picture, I´m never gonna watch the academy-show again. I think it is a typical Tom Hanks-movie.He says maybe 10 lines.And he is nominated for best actor. I´m not saying that Tom Hanks is a bad actor. I loved Forrest Gump and Apollo 13. This movie is good but I think that 'The Thin Red Line' is a better war-movie. The ratings for this movie is just 6.5 of 10.",7,0,0,20 February 1999
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino+Travolta=the best ever
",This movie is the best that ever has been made.John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson are outstanding and Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors in the world.I also think that this movie should have won the academy award.Everything in this movie is great.I´ve seen it about 20 times and it gets better and better every time.,10,2,5,8 January 1999
The Thin Red Line," What happened to John Travolta
",I saw this movie tonight and I just came home. Afterwards I think that the only person who could have saved this movie John Travolta just disappeared after 2 minutes. The movie could need his acting-style to break the boringness of this movie. Nick Nolte and Sean Penn are both good in this movie but sometimes you could think this is a swedish film with staring faces and poetic language. George Clooney said maybe 2 lines. I don't think that this movie should be nominated for best picture. Perhaps for best photography. Now I hope that Travolta can show his talent in Primary Colors and A Civil Action. He´s one of the best actors ever and I´m really disappointed tonight. I mean they could really give him more than 2 minutes.,6,0,0,21 February 1999
