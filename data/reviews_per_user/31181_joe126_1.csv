The Blair Witch Project," The big rip-off
","I find it sad that such a movie can completely rip-off so many other obscure, yet superior movies and get away unnoticed.  All the Blair Witch Project is is Man Bites Dog (it even simulates the final shots) and Cannibal Holocaust (it even copies the tagline).  Save yourself the trouble and go watch these screen gems instead.",Null,0,1,18 April 2002
