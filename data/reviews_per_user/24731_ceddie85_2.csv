The Expendables 2," Pure cheesy crap!!!
",you cast all the action stars you can get but that still doesn't change how horribly bad this movie is. the acting was so bland and dry i was highly disappointed in the especially w/ the cast in this movie.Bruce will do any movie these days he has really fallen hard and i don't think their is any redemption..Stallone has always been a terrible actor but its like the older he gets the worse off he is.Arnold no you need to work on those acting chops again that was unacceptable just bad bad bad..the action was just pointless in most scenes..their was 2 much going with no clear point of the direction to go on besides blowing things up..please don't make a 3rd movie.

The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rise is absolutely insanely EXCELLENT!!!
","The Dark Knight Rises is the best film I have ever..ever seen!! I couldn't take my eyes off the screen not 1 single moment..no dull unnecessary scenes in this Masterpiece..it serves you entertainment at an all-time high..see this film so you will NT miss out on such an amazing treasure from Mr.Christopher Nolan.Nolan blessed fans w/ something they will never forget.Anne Hathaway was the business as Selina..she surprised me bringing her A game to her role!!!her character was a scene stealer in ever scene.Bane was brutal,evil,menacing best villain ever.Christopher Bale was at his best yet as Batman hope he receives an Oscar nomination.This movie is a classic work of art closing an EPIC trilogy..A+",10,2,7,20 July 2012
