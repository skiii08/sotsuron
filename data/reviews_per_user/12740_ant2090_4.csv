The Blair Witch Project," ?
","I saw this movie when I was 10 and it scared the crap out of me! I could not believe this story was made. The film was good and just the right length. I thought this movie was scarier than The Exorcist. I remember the night I had seen it I had 2 sleep with the light on and I kept on waking up every (what seemed like) 10 minutes. It wasn't until I was older that I realized this movie was not real! I always kind of knew it I even argued with my Sis-in-law but she would always tell me I was wrong and that this tape was really found in the woods. Whatever! I knew I had seen Heather Donahue on the MTV Movie Awards, it wasn't just some look-a-like! Well I recommend this movie if you are looking for a scare!",8,0,2,27 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Star Wars 3
","This has to be the best Star Wars film out of the prequels and the original trilogy. I highly recommend this movie. You will be surprised by all the deaths in this movie! Everything is perfect and most of the scenes in this movie are interesting with enough information to keep you wondering how it will all end up. Who will die first? Who will die last? Who will survive? This is one of the best movies this year so far; if you don't believe me, go check it out yourself. This movie will definitely have you at the edge of your seat scene after scene after scene. Awesome and this movie could not have been better, except it would have been perfect if a certain death in this movie would not have happened.",8,1,4,22 May 2005
The Wolverine," The Wolverine Has Arrived
","After the debacle that is 'Origins: Wolverine,' the character has finally been given the proper treatment all fans have been waiting for.In 'The Wolverine,'a tormented Logan must come to terms with the loss of Jean Grey,the love of his life. After years of wandering, he meets Yukio, an assassin from Japan who is sent to fetch Logan on behalf of her master (Yashida), who Logan saved during the attack on Nagasaki in 1945. Here is where Logan meets another possible love interest, who he strives to protect from the Yakusa.Throughout the film, Famke Janssen's Jean Grey appears--guiding and tormenting Logan until he finally learns to accept that the past cannot be undone. 'The Wolverine' breathes new life into the character, resulting in one of the best superhero films--one that actually tells a story and keeps its audience watching for that reason, not so much because there is explosive, nonsensical destruction every 2 minutes.Go watch 'The Wolverine.'",8,24,46,26 July 2013
Fantastic Four," Fantastic Four
","This movie was really good. It is one of the best superhero movies I have seen! I can't believe that this movie has been taken so much crap from all those movie critics. Fantast 4 has comedy, drama, action and everything a movie needs to be number 1. Granted Fantastic Four is no X-Men, but I liked it better than any of the Spider-Man movies. It is true that you should not compare it to X-Men, Fantastic Four, or Hellboy because Fantastic Four is good in it's own genre. The special effects in this movie are somewhat disappointing, especially the Mr. Fantastic effects. Other than that the invisible force fields (which I found too Jean Greyishy) were cool, and the fire was really cool too. Well you should really check this movie out!",7,2,5,15 July 2005
