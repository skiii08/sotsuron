Blade Runner 2049," YOLO- Don't waste it on this drivel!
","The soundtrack, a cacophony of earsplitting discordance that had me sitting with hands pressed to ears, is but one of the clues that this is a piece not worthy of consideration. Heavy reliance on background soundtrack is often an indicator of thin plot or weak screenplay - in this case the screenplay was pathetic, even garbled at times, and the film dragged tortuously along, almost in real-time, at least an hour and a half too long. I began rooting for the demise of the hero just to end my own misery, but remained in my seat hoping something interesting would happen. Visually monochromatically dark and ugly, if this is what passes for emotional depth and celebration of humanity, I fear for our culture. Theking has no clothes on!",1,37,78,6 October 2017
