The Blair Witch Project," Great Film Making
","That was the most effective use I have seen of the least amount of equipment.  I thought this movie was ingenious.  I recommend it to anyone who wants a good scare.  It left the 'monster' up to imagination, which is always scarier than real life.  I thought it was one of the best scary movies of the year.  My only question is where is the proof that this really did happen?",9,1,3,26 April 1999
