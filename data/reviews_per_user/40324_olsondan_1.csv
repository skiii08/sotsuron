Blade Runner 2049," Well I loved it!
","I am old enough to have seen the original Blade Runner and to tell the truth I didn't quite understand what it was about, until I read the book. Still, this Blade Runner was far smoother. I understood what was happening and, most importantly, I cared about what happened to the characters. I also fully understood and identified the villain(s). 
Ryan Gosling, well, I never really cared for him as an actor, but the wretched humanity of his Android(?) character, broke my heart. You know you are enjoying a movie when you start crying, without realizing it. 
What can you say about Harrison Ford? He has become a part of our cultural identity. Yet, although I'm of a similar age to him, I found myself asking, 'How did he get so old?' An evident reality in the movie, that contributed to your caring about his character. 
The visual pallet isn't jarring or too edgy. It was smooth, richly stark(acknowledged oxymoron), elegant. It didn't become a separate entity in the show, but a complimenting background bringing the characters to the forefront. 
This was a story that I could get behind. The agony of the identification of the navel point of the 'I Am' which we all struggle with at one point in our lives.",10,0,3,26 December 2017
