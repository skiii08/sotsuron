Walk the Line," The Best Biographical Movie Ever
","This has got to be the best representation of the Man in Black anyone could ever hope to see if you like Johnny Cash you'll love this movie. Phoenix does an excellent performance and Whitherspoon is just as good. The must see movie of the year!!! I also like the determination that Pheonix had buy going to a vocal coach for a year just to get Johnny Cashes voice perfect. I was personally worried that because Pheonix doesn't actually look like Cash in real life would take away from the believability, but the more you hear him sing the more he becomes Cash. Well in my eyes at least. So definitely see this movie if you are a Cash fan.",10,0,2,27 November 2005
