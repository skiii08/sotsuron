Blade Runner 2049," Outstanding
","Probably one of my favorite films ever made. Absolutely loved it. Fantastic sequel, presenting the possibility of further sequels. Thought provoking, profound, visually stunning! Can't wait to watch again. I love the combination of sound, graphics, scenery, plot, twists etc",10,3,13,8 October 2017
