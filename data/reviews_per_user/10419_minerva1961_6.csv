Iron Man 3," Peaked at The Avengers
","Poor Robert Downey Jr, decent actors shouldn't have to put up with rubbish scripts like this, this was a major disappointment, in years to come people will look back and know for sure that Iron Man peaked at The Avengers. This was trash, Guy Pearce's baddie was laughable, he should have refused the role but even worse was Ben Kingsley doing the Mandarin, how the mighty have fallen, from Oscar Gandi to this trash...it was embarrassing watching it.My 14yr old gave it an 8/10 but the 16yr old gave it a generous 4, I give it a 2 but wow, what a huge disappointment, all the best bits are in the trailer.",2,24,49,29 April 2013
Lincoln," Unbelievably awful waste of time and money
","Spoiler Alert - specific spoilers in here.This is the most ridiculous movie I've watched in a long time. A wasted effort.I understand this is not an action movie - so why start with a war scene straight out of Saving Private Ryan, play that for ten minutes and then spend the rest of the movie exploring the political machinations of Washington and trying to get around 20 votes to pass slaving reforms. Spoiler alert, it was passed. Oh and right at the start the two black soldiers were able to quote a previous Lincoln speech word perfect, thanks Mr Spielberg, completely believable.. I'm sure that really happened.Daniel Day Lewis spends WAY too much time talking to the floor, there's absolutely and completely no passion from him, he wanders off into little stories that have little relevance to the topic and at one point even one of the senators buggers off because he can't be arsed listening to yet another boring story.His son wants to join the Army and Lincoln does his level best to stop him, even taking him to a hospital where he witnesses cartloads of limbs being thrown into a pit but STILL the son signs up BUT Mrs Lincoln completely illogically spends a entire scene berating Lincoln for letting their son sign up - that scene was just put in there so she could show her acting chops, it lost all of it's dramatic effect because Lincoln DID try everything in his power to stop his son signing up, no wonder he spends the entire time looking down and talking to the floor, it's because he gets blamed for everything..The amendment gets passed (hurrah!) but the reasons for each senator changing from a no to a yes isn't fully explored, it seems almost random, THEN it gets REALLY disjointed and amateurish - Lincoln gets shot, Spielberg spends A LOT of time showing Lincoln leaving the house for the last time and next scene it's some guy in the theater shouting the Presidents been shot, next scene its a doctor declaring him dead at home and then some fantasy sequence with Lincoln giving what I can only imagine is meant to be a soaring speech to a large crowd but it was the dullest speech in the whole movie and should have been moved to DVD extras.If it's not a Lincoln bio-op then why do the shooting, it was meant to be about the 13th Amendment but why add 30 minutes extra about the assassination. This movie was a wasted opportunity, a confused mess which doesn't know what it wants to be, and just because DDL is in it and it's about abolishing slavery everyone is applauding it but even 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' was better than this pile of dog pooh and that's saying something!",1,171,326,24 January 2013
Thor," Best Marvel movie since first Ironman
","My 12 and 14 yr old sons (and this 50 year old geezer!) loved this movie, much better than I was expecting, it had almost everything you could ask for it in it; action +++, heroic struggles, redemption, the very obvious baddies, the occasional twists, good looking woman, good looking men, lots and lots of explosions, big set pieces, unexpected humour, giant killer robots and references to the Avengers, what else could any red blooded male ask for - except maybe a light sabre or two, it was fun, is NEVER going to win any Oscars or awards for acting or direction but if this was Kenneth Branagh's first Marvel directing job then he did an excellent job of it, go see it on a big screen, we saw it in 2D and not 3D and THOROUGHLY enjoyed it, the kids want to go again and am tempted, best Marvel movie since first Ironman !",10,1,4,4 May 2011
Moonrise Kingdom," Stunned.
","It's been quite a few years since I sat in a cinema and didn't move until the very last note of the closing credit music was played. I think the last time was The Hours and I have to say I was completely floored by this movie, I was dragged along not knowing what to expect and I was riveted to the screen for two hours. I will definitely be going back to see this masterpiece again.My only slight concern was the 'hand on chest' moment, I felt uncomfortable about that and didn't think it was necessary but that's a personal opinion. The rest of the movie just blew me away, famous actor after famous actor kept appear on the screen and there where some genuinely LOL moments (usually involving extreme weather!).I have no idea who Wes Anderson & Roman Coppola are but they both deserve a huge pat on the back for writing this and Anderson for directing it. It was impossible to know how this movie was going to twist and turn, there were just so many unexpected surprises but the biggest surprise was just how good this movie is. Go see it and measure all other movies against this one from now on.",10,1,2,14 July 2012
Looper," More depth than I was expecting
","I thought this was going to be a run of the mill Bruce Willis lots of explosions movie and of course there were lots of explosions BUT the film changes from what you expect into something much deeper, about half way through you realise the trailer hasn't done this movie justice, some parts of it I was actually shocked at but I can't tell you why without spoiling the movie.. It's not the usual good guy/bad guy and time travel fare, it's much deeper than that and explores the issues in novel and sometimes shocking ways but the last 30 minutes of the movie blew me away...totally unexpected... I enjoyed this movie very much and it left me thinking thinking thinking afterwards.",10,8,25,30 September 2012
Cloud Atlas," Must read the book first!
","If you haven't read the book then you are going to find this movie challenging. It's a huge book and they have tried to shoe-horn it into 2hrs 45 minutes, can you imagine The Lord of the Rings in a short movie...it's kind'a ironic because The Hobbit is a very short novel and Hollywood has stretched it out to three movies, the first one being ohh look 2hrs 45 minutes... doh! This movie needs to be seen on a big screen...it's a big screen movie - or sit very close to your telly, the make-up in particular is wow... distracting even but if you have read the book then there's two major differences; (a) The time-line in the book goes from past to future and then back to the past, it's a Christmas tree shaped time-line...in the movie it switches very rapidly and all over the place...it seems that in the first ?20 minutes it changes almost every two minutes...that will VERY much confuse the viewer..(b) They have skimmed the story...so so much is missing, I was almost outraged at how much was skipped...the book goes into so much detail but the movie has dropped so much of the content that gives meaning to the scenes...However, having said that I loved loved loved this movie, it works on so many levels and is so thought provoking, I just can't wait until they do it properly, the way it deserves, in a three movie deal.",8,1,3,5 January 2013
