The Blair Witch Project," Re: This is a movie not footage
","HeyDO NOT BE FOOLED!! This is a normal movie and could not be real for various reasons (a) all the actors are still acting and therefore the footage wasn't real (b) national governments would not allow real footage to be shown in a cinema on the grounds of public policy, because it would result in many complaints from their parents and probably litigation...if I know the American legal system well.For those of you who believe all the hype, believe that this movie is actually footage of people being chased or whatever, wake up and don't be so damn naive. For those of you who claim you saw FBI missing persons profiles on these people, this is MARKETING FOR Hollywood, simply blown up hype to excite naive and gullable young people. Everything else which indicates that this movie was actually real footage MUST BE FAKE because it is literally impossible to show such a thing without the consent of their parents, plus if it was actually real, people like myself in Europe would have heard about it by now.I'm not being stubborn or anything here, but you can't really beat this view because its common sense, Heather Donaghue is acting in a new movie next year, alas she is still ALIVE AND WELL.",Null,1,2,20 November 2004
