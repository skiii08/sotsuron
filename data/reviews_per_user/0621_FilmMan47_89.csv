Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," 4th and the best
",This one is 4th film in the series and amazing improvement over the last dull project at worlds end 2007 this franchise was sinking after that one but thanks to this film on strangers times the pirates of Caribbean once again found its way back to the top Johnny Depp returns as jack sparrow with also new cast members including Penelope Cruz which was interesting because these two Depp and Cruz have a history together they also worked with each other on different films before so it was nice overall this film is great my rating is 10/10.enjoy,10,1,1,31 October 2019

The Equalizer," Nothing More Then A Never Ending Video Game Cutscene
","i will totally not go into any long discussions specially about this director Antoine Fuqua this man ruined Chow Yun Fat's Hollywood debut in the replacement killers Mr.Fuqua likes to ape John Woo and video games too much anyone who has good taste in cinema or a fan of action films will agree after watching will end up saying this is a serious mess of a film plus i bet all doubts will be cleared about this director.forget the cast i mean Marton Csokas reminds me of Dougray Scott he did good acting,Chole Grace Mortez appears with a hilarious makeup as a prostitute she looked more like Harley Quinn of DC comics here and finally Danzel Washington the finest actor of our times embarrassing himself here in the role of so called tough anti hero on par with man of fire and many justice revenge films like death wish series.i have to agree with everyone who is saying john wick is better then this absolutely hell yes i have seen a lot of anti Russian movies this was no surprise but the premise is so bad even more then a usual Dolph Lundgren movie but since it is based on a TV series of a same name from 80s equalizer this adaptation fails to deliver i am sure that original TV show was not like this with the guy zooming in on bad guys suddenly he becomes Max Payne shooting everyone in less then 10 seconds.let us look the story here now OK this guy Robert Mccall leaves a violent past life behind living a good life then he gets involved in troubles of a girl Teri after she gets beat up bad by Russian bad guys who run some sort of escort service.some pointless dialogs are between Robert & the villain teddy was annoying like you look at me what you see then i look at you and tell what i see,how original the writer was on drugs i am sure.this is a 2 hour nonsense of boring drama and cgi action junk pipe lines blowing up Denzel Washington is using bullet time going slow motion the entire time he appears why don't bad guys have this mode the final fight is in a warehouse with hero winning by a nail gun.i am sorry but i did't like this at all and man on fire is no good either it is tony Scott's worst film ever his best & last is top gun only but if anyone loves Denzel Washington try book of Eli please it is his best ever besides what was Denzel thinking when he signed the contract about time he should do a comedy film.like i said before this film is nothing more then a never ending cut scene from a video game even if audience loves cheesy stuff this does not qualify least bit.Overall The Equalizer 2014 is a waste of time,money it provides heavy brain damage my rating is 2/10.skipp it",2,5,8,10 February 2015
The Expendables 2," JCVD Gets Wasted In This Awful Sequel
",the expendables 1 was better this is 2 a sequel but has zero quality the script is extremely bad that wasted all of the cast.the plot:the expendables goes on a mission upon reaching the area one of their guy gets killed in-front of them by Villain now the expendables want revenge their mission is now find him and kill him.the cast:Stallone and all the action legends come together but one man gets wasted here is Jean Claude Van Damme i am a hard core Van Damme fan he plays a bad guy in this film plus in the climax fight he gets killed easily this was only to make Stallone look better he didn't even fight.his hard target 1993 is an Oscar worthy film and better then this any day.overall the first part is better this is a mindless sequel except chuck Norris who appears and kills all the guys which was one hilarious scene.my rating for the expendables 2 2012 is 2/10 Skipp it.i hope the 3rd film is better.,2,0,2,5 February 2014
Skyfall," Its Official Agent 007 Is Dead & Some Other Person Has Taken His Alias
","starting,Daniel Craig & Javier Bardem.i mean it seriously i am a huge bond fan when it comes to bond the first one was Sean Connery he was awesome but i love Dalton & pierce I watch those films so many times I have all bond discs the Craig ones too,but sky-fall is a proof that bond died long time ago.the last good film was die another day to be serious the reboot with casino Royal destroyed James bonds legacy with Daniel Craig & Qos 2008 did same thing now its sky-fall.the plot is about 007 saving mi6 & M(Judi Dench) because some mega maniac villain named Silva(Javier Bardem) is after her & will stop & nothing to create havoc or should i say nonsense.can i use the term LOL this film fits in to that category because Silva to me was one stupid villain he wasted all the time in the climax plus bond was a coward instead of fighting him hes running away from him 007 never runs away & hides in a mansion & uses knives.sky-fall was the name of bonds mansion where he was grown up.Craig sucks as bond he don't have any class to be honest, the girls were extremely bad.i mean eve & Severn(Berenice Marlowe) she was totally drunk & that manly voice.plus the new q is a joke giving bond stupid gadgets.the villain Silva was gay i have no problem with him but his strategy showed how stupid he was he could easily take out bond with his team.sky-fall plot does not continues from CR & QOS please remember that. the only good thing in this film was Aston martin classic car that is now destroyed too.i mean i saw this film 2 times will see again i have DVD but common this is not James bond the character we all knew, he died after die another day 2002 i guess lets assume it.this guy Craig he killed bond & took his identity .just change bond films time-line for example think that Craig films happened before Connery you will see what i mean.off course that cannot happen but its just my thinking.every time i see Craig bond film i fell its something else i am seeing.its not the bond i knew.Pierce Brosnan was the last true bond who holds certain abilities that makes him fit for the role & that's why everyone loved him.sky-fall is just a slightly better film then casino Royal & quantum of solace if you see it as action film & the music the title song sky-fall is nice but not perfect as Adele tried to copied Sheryl crow.the director SAM Mendez was nice but not like martin Campbell.and how the hell this film won Oscar common golden-eye deserves Oscar.overall sky-fall is a mash-up of previous bond films & other hit agent movies.like the concept of betraying their Intel services like 006 did in golden-eye & Sean Ambrose in mission impossible 2.but when i saw sky- fall i was angry for the same thing repeated again.my rating is 1/10 thank you Barbra broccoli you just insulted Ian Flemming.your father & true hardcore James bond fans like me.i will never forgive.regards from a Pakistani fan here who loves James bond",1,4,10,8 March 2013
Hereditary," foolish film
",Toni Collette should retire now she is doing horrible films this is one of them i saw this long time ago not worth it it is such a drag boring and nonsense typical ghost story with unbelievable weird plot that don't make any sense it was painful to sit through this garbage.,1,4,12,2 October 2019
Fury," Who Told David Ayer He Can Make A War Film
","First of all i am looking for the person who whispered David Ayer in his ears & told him that he can make a war film without doing some research on the genre this guy David Ayer can't even make a proper regular movie only critics & fan boys praise it and people hate John Woo.Let me recommend 3 films that includes better tank chase sequence first ones is golden-eye where James bond destroys everyone in stylish manner second film is wind-talkers of Nicolas cage that movie gets hate but it is way better then fury any day finally the third film is Defience of Daniel Craig yes that film is quite possibly the best ever plus the story was top notch keeping the viewer exited.Who cares if this film was based on real story or fictional the whole project went down in gutter just because of unrealistic situations here OK here are few that made me angry the tanks can't shoot at the target for some unknown reason when they do they have blue laser lights now is this star wars or what in the climax everything blows up but somehow Brad Pitt was using cheat code or something that his tank survived but he gets shot 3 times by a sniper Brad Pitt still survives that & talks to his friend for the last time before dying.Why these filmmakers think that including a rape scene or creating loud explosions will make anything a success if we look at monuments men of George colony things are in balance but this is a solid mess.The Plot:what plot no one would believe that this movie has an actual story or a proper narrative connected to it but i will still tell it anyway,in 1945 war-daddy is a army dude who is leading some 5 men army to complete a mission in Germany.The Cast:totally the most blunt cast ever none of these people took acting lessons before except Shia Labeouf & Brad Pitt.Brad Pitt is the only reason anyone should watch this as he is the solo coolest guy you will root for despite the weird character he was given.This film actually makes fun of war & Hitler era that OK so many people have died who cares lets mock them either they are Americans or Germans i have to say life is life no matter what.Fury is only a time pass movie if you don't have something decent to watch some hot babes can be seen here but they are of no use all this movie needs is Robert Downey Jr & it would look better.Overall the team & makers of Fury 2014 should face some serious Jury so they could never release a torture like this on the audience ever again my rating is 4/10:watch this but just don't take it seriously.",4,3,9,7 January 2015
Captain Marvel," Better Than Wonder Woman Any Day
","I cant believe it some people hate Brie Larson so much it shows how much threated these critics and haters are of a girl I mean what mentality is this ,what has she done to you people she is living her life is famous having fun and actually has some charisma unlike that stupid wonder woman Gal Gadot garbage people love it,I am not a fan or wither wonder woman or captain marvel but I was judgmental of this before I thought it was going to be a bad film but this turned out better I had no expectations of this and actually enjoyed it this got better action better dialogs comedy and fun then any wonder woman nonsense Any day plus this film defeated and surpassed wonder woman at box office, and no Brie Larson is not paying me any money to write this review this is my honest opinion of this film and her.my rating is 5/10 watch captain marvel .",5,2,7,5 June 2019
World War Z," Brad Pitt's Horrible Horror Extravaganza
","based on the novel of the same name also inspired from many zombie & horror flicks worldwide i am not going to discuss further,as brad Pitt used to make good films in 90s & early 2000s but since 2005 his projects are taking a wrong turn including last years biggest disappointment killing them softly 2012 & now this.Cast:Brad Pitt & Mireille EnosStory:Gerry Lane works for united nations his wife & children are on the run from a terrible virus that is spreading from united states to the whole world creating world war where zombies are unleashed everywhere.now i am a horror & zombie films fan myself i have seen a lot of then wrong turn series & other films like i am legend 2007 are quite popular films that deals with same story,a script like this needs c grade actors what is a iconic actor like brad Pitt doing in this mess is beyond explanation has he lost it,he should come up with good scripts now otherwise he will become next Steven sea-gal & Wesley snipes,i would love to see brad make a comeback with Angelina Jolie like Mr & Mr smith 2005.i saw this with no expectations as zombie films are always duds that provides mindless entertainment but world war z provided nothing except useless screaming,shouting & the characters jumping places all around world with a reason but it becomes pointless as they failed to stop the zombie mania,i don't even want to mention the script writer here,many people ask that does Skipp woods exist or not i say he writes nice then most I've seen better then this at any time.look at the children in these films so annoying.cant they make a film without kids.those who are expecting a masterpiece just because its a brad Pitt & Mireille Enos will be disappointed,as for Mireille Enos this woman's career is going down day by day with bad TV shows like the killing,if you are a zombie film buff or & horror fan its is the worst you will get,forget the critics they are useless people with a lot of money & no sense films are for people not for critics.World War Z is Brad Pitt's horrible horror extravaganza dream that went into category of epic fail just like silver linings play-book 2012.a similar film doom came in 2005 based on the greatest horror video game ever created doom 3,the story of world war z is ripped of from resident evil & doom series.My Rating Is 1/10 its awful at its best just pretend that this film never existed & watch some old real classic war films are better then this any day anytime.Skipp this film immediately",1,2,7,8 September 2013
The Hunger Games," The Junker Games Will Rob You So Do Not Watch This Even For Free
","you read it right this film is pile of junk & may i ask what were some of the good actors doing there like Wes Bentley .i mean what the hell is this about the story shows that N.America is divided and is names Panem.with 12 districts .the 2 young people are selected each year to participate in hunger games.and those are televised & everyone is watching them on TV in Panem this film looks like Rambo meets Jason Bourne but i had hopes because i didn't have even seen the Pics or trailers of the movie.hoped for some action & brutality but it sucked at it.why didn't they used guns in this film if they are allowed to kill and win what exactly is the hunger games its filled with cheap wannabes pretending to be tougher but end up failing.& Jennifer Lawrence cant act she can only smooch in movies with her big fish lips.maybe if you put some dirt on a basketball stadium she would suck it up . put AL Pacino in this and it would look better.this film wastes not only the time & money but it spins your head also i am shocked at why everyone is going crazy about this film.people lost the taste. & i read it just beat titanic which is re released on 3d.just see some old James bond films like golden-eye or something, its crappy film like these are ruining cinema.what a shame.i am sorry but i have to warn others please do not watch this for free you will regret.there are no games in this film its an insult to sportsmy rating is 0/10 most awful film in history .there is a Japanese film called battle Royal i think ill go check that out it would be better then this trash",1,20,30,9 April 2012
Argo," Argo by all means is not a Oscar material film.period
","as entertainment film it was good but not Oscar material.the Oscar community is fake.worst film cant get a Oscar,hey i can use my mobile & dance in the shower that can be entertaining & Oscar material too.look whatever happened in real i don't want to discuss it & the racism & all that hate whatever is going on between America & Iran back in the days & now the thing is Argo 2012 is a movie & should not be taken seriously.i saw this film months ago & i found out that Ben Affleck is a good director he knows what hes doing.but things went bad as the history says something elseArgo is about few American embassy people trapped in Iran & tony Mendez is some CIA agent sent to take them back home.now main problem is this how can these dudes getting away as Canadians and tony is leading them they make mistakes & cover is blown in a second.at climax i expected action where plane scene every guy on the road in Iran is angry for no reason.id say every nation should be patriotic its great but don't go to the extreme level that you forget others.mind it if you want but making movies like this will only cause hatred in the world it did nothing good just made cash & won fake awards all they can.anyway i am still giving 3 for Argo its is a overrated film & its mass propaganda but for some comedy i give points.my rating is 3/10.",1,1,3,24 March 2013
Spider-Man 2," 2nd installment & its just brilliant

Batman Returns," Superfreak:worst batman ever or not even batman at all
","You read it right guys is this a joke or what first of all I like Tim Burton he made some good films before this and after this .but this film batman returns is not even a film forget about being a batman film this is batman at its worst ,the first film that burton made in late 80s of batman was good, this is so bad on so many levels I cant explain the Direction,Costume,Acting the cast almost everything is bad and negative what else is positive, Michael Keaton yes this guy is a good actor but this film is nonsense ,batman is weak here cant even fight a woman how can he fight big guys then, second of all its filled with worst comic characters of all time Cat woman and penguin I hate Michelle Pffifer as cat woman not hating the actress but the character I hated Anne Hathaways 2012 the dark knight version too Cat woman is basically not a worthy character at all to put in any batman movie or comics it should be Deleted,the only scene with Catwoman is watchable is when she and batman meets in some party and Rick James famous song super freak plays on karaoke and instrumental music only it was used as a reference that batman should stay away and Watch out for cat woman as cat woman is a super freak and cannot be trusted and as for penguin ok Danny DeVito is a great actor he displays his performance here and to be honest only reason I saw this train wreck because of him I am not his fan but even he fails as the character is one sided and boring, now lets come to batman and his things ok there is one scene when batman is fighting goons on street at one point he takes out is Batarang the weapon with pointy edges and cuts like knife deep, he throws on those guys and its got little computer screen on it .it floats and come back to batman this whole scene was like a parody of Batman, it's some comedy or what, the only good thing is the score and soundtrack disc cd with the song face to face performed by Souxie And The Banshees .that's it apart from this the whole film is a messy garbage specially Cat Woman and her falling of from windows and street cats giving her life. My rating for this is 1/10 stars save your money and time do not buy or rent this film on disc I Throwed away mine in garbage because that's where it belongs utter trash if some one give you this for free please do not accept this even as a gift its just my advice its torture and my give brain damage to you.

Orphan," Get Ready To See One Hell Of An Underrated Performance By Isabelle Fuhrman
","i mean it by the title this film should get Oscar i know its old but still i loved it maybe the reason is the one underrated actress i have never know about until i saw this or the script i say both.the thing about this film is its not really a horror film its a deep suspense film filled with epic character,epic dialog and epic performances,people may get bored watching this but i guarantee the first time anyone who have never seen this type of film will get hooked on,i have seen omen and all other horror films but nothing comes close to this.the plot:a family adopts a 9 years old girl Esther who is believed to came from Russia to USA,after her arrival the trouble around everyone starts with Kate suspecting that Esther is behind all the accidents but not sure until it upon investigation it is revealed that Esther is a little girl who tricks everyone with her charms but shes the most dangerous person ever.the cast:Vera Farmiga was amazing as always,Peter Sarsgaard got me tricked i though he was Kiefer Sutherland,the two kid actors were great to see but highlight of the movie is Isabelle Fuhrman she was awesome throughout the film she got everything right from emotion to dialog delivery it looked like worked in some near three hundred film as her acting was solid she is picking up good scripts see this is what i call an underrated one the Oscars are fake and as far as i see if your a great actor you don't have to have awards what we all have been seeing all talentless people and useless movies releasing its all fake so hats of to Isabelle Furhman i didn't even rooted much for heath ledger in the dark knight 2008 but this is one villain i cheered and rooted for.this topic is not new the children who commit crimes and have personality disorders with diseases and all that but this film is really an eye opener just what is going on in this world can you even trust someone in life not even some child sorry i had to say it this topic is serious and very real stuff like that do happen,its scary its entertaining its violent but do watch this with open mind as this project got everything to be a classicWith Jaume Collet Serra giving good directions with a great script on hands the output is before us orphan to me is one of the best and most memorable films ever made.overall my rating for Orphan 2009 is 10/10 Highly Recommended:A Must Watch Film At least for Isabelle Furhman.",10,2,4,1 February 2014

Spider-Man: Homecoming," Garbage Man:Heap Coming
","you read my summer title right because this is exactly what this film is simply pure 100 percent a grade garbage from Hollywood.from start to end this film is a mess it involves iron man.vulture & other crap it tried hard to be serious like batman dark knight 2008 film but failed,speaking of batman just what the hell was Michael Keaton doing here was he so desperate to act in this junk for money,Keaton will always be remembered as original batman from 80s & 90s,the vulture character is weak & dull is just a cheap copy of green goblin,vulture is not even good for video games whoever approved this idea for this film should be in prison.the story of this film sucks peter Parker is a school boy & gets a suit from iron man(Robert Downy Jr) but gets in trouble many times when he tries to save people from bad guys.the action is all cgi,the ship scene is hilarious & spider-man fails iron man saves the day,the final plane scene is a parody of James Bond films.this new actor Tom Holland can act but the script & direction puts him down,missing romance element & bad-ass spider-man hand & fist fights.i hated Andrew Garfield's 2012 spider-man reboot films but this is even worst then that,Kirsten Dunst was right when she was asked about this film a few months back, she is the real Mary Jane back they made the best one in 2002,Toby McGuire is the only real spider-man, & Sam Raimi is the only best director for spider-man films he set the bar so high that no one will ever surpass him.this film will sure make money or theatrical run & disc release but it has no repeat value,go pick up the Sam Raimi Trilogy its better & entertaining then this any-day.spider-man homecoming is one of 3rd worst films in 2017 after Baywatch 2017 & ghost in the shell 2017 i tell you a pure waste of time & money my rating is 1/10.skipp it",1,31,56,7 July 2017
Fast & Furious 6," The Franchise Has Taken A Wrong Turn & Crossed Limits
","i just saw this film few minutes ago & i just came to do a review.i have done so many reviews i am not a critic if i was one then things would be different as i would have giving full points without a reason thats just what critic's are do they are a decease .now fast a furious is a big franchise unfortunately since previous few installments its gone out of line & has taken a wrong turn it is trying to be something its not.these films were about heists if you remember the first film but it was inside USA they didn't go international till Tokyo drift thats where i think it went bad after that i am saying Tokyo drift was the last best film in the series.here is why for me.the plot of fast 6 continues from fast 5 it starts as Hobbs(the rock) goes to Dom Toretto(Vin diesel) & asks him to help him in capturing criminal shaw(Luke Evans) & also gives info about one of their members Letty(Michelle Rodriguez)who was once lover of Dom & believed to be dead.now if you have seen fast & furious 2009 you will remember what happened to Letty .now in this film Letty don't remembers anything & when the race scene comes between Letty & Dom i was like oh yes the movie went back to original cars & racing stuff.but they have gone too far this time its like oceans trilogy & other heist films.the action was so hilarious here specially when Vin diesel jumped to catch Letty of the tank & landed one the car safely i mean is this spider-man i am seeingthe cast failed to impress as again except rock he shows his usual wrestling moves,the dialog's & comedy involved here with some nice stunts will bring cash to this film,.cant blame the director or any other here the reason is that movies now have become a money making business they don't care about the story anymore & because of this the true fans of any franchise gets disappointed.over all fast & furious 6 is a one time watch but only if you seen all five films before that.if you don't then its not for you.my rating is 5/10.fast 6 is a solid example of why most people prefer classic films & will watch them any time",5,1,3,30 May 2013

","what i have to say about it is that when there is a movie coming out they should release a single DVD it should be unrated & include deleted scenes other wise the audience will get annoyed & wont understand the film the same thing happened with Leon 1994.i saw this film i found the info on net that there are many versions of this film lying around.i mean please i don't even know what DVD i have i wanted to see more.the plot:Leon is a professional assassin one day he returns home & watches the family next door to him & brutally murdered by bad drug cops.but one member little girl Mathilda survived & asks Leon for help now what will Leon do?the rest of the film you will have to see but the most interesting thing about this film i liked was their relationship.is it like friends,father daughter or lovers.the age difference between them is huge but there together & Leon was protecting her.over all i liked Leon for what it was but as i said about the disc it needs a re release uncut .same thing ill say for tom cruise film mi2.i want to see uncut.jean reno was great but Natalie port-man omg she just nailed it.now shes a big name in Hollywood & has many fans one of my favorite film of her is v for vendetta.and oh Gary old-man was absolute nuts & hilariousalso there is a Indian remake of this film named bicchoo 2000 starting bobby deol as Leon.it was a nice tribute i guess.check that out if you want.my rating is 5/10.watch Leon the professional for the interesting relationship & life of an assassin",5,1,6,8 March 2013
The Bourne Identity," I Am New To The Series & I Really Enjoyed This Its Highly Entertaining
","as i said on my review title that i am new to the Bourne series i recently bought the trilogy & loved watching all of the 3 but this is my review for the Bourne identity 2002 starting Matt Damon as Jason Bourne a trained assassin who has lost his memory.Jason doesn't know who he is & who he worked for now all this he have to figure it out on his own along with a girl named Marie who don't have money & is traveling .how they both figure things out plus there are a lot of bad guys out there to kill them . when i heard about the series i never was interested in watching any of it.but i am happy that i watched it recently & i loved it.this film spawned 2 more sequels .overall this film is highly entertaining its got action,suspense & great story.my rating is 10/10 must see",10,2,3,19 December 2011
The Italian Job," Rest Film Is Boring Except The Full Of Action Climax
","skip to the end to see the full action climax of car chases.Mark Whalberg & Chalrize Theron starts in the film as robbers who will do anything to steal the gold from Steve(Edward Norton) who early in the film betrayed them.its like this this film was a remake of a old film of the same name but despite the action & plot the film failed to entertain me.i don't know about critics cause they are stupid people also they lie too much.but this film is still worth a watch but only for climax you cannot sit through this the entire time.& what was the villains henchman doing on the bike circling around the streets going up & down the shopping malls. the camera was focused on him all the time.there is also a bollywood remake of this film called players 2012 starting abhishek bachan,which was a flop BTW.heist films like fast & furious work because the involve racing & awesome cars.anyway the Italian job should have been called the L.A job because the setting was in L.A .my rating is 3/10 see Charlize Theron Kicking Butts",3,0,3,13 November 2012
We're the Millers," This Film Is Funny But Can Be Highly Offensive To Some People
","that is absolutely right what i said it title summary i am a Emma Roberts fan i hope i can meet her one day shes a great actress when i saw this film recently this film includes some hilarious comedy & funny situations but many people can get offended due to the vulgar content.the cast:we have all the big names here specially Jennifer Aniston Emma Roberts,Molly C Quinn,Will Poulter they all did a perfect job the comic timing & chemistry between characters was amazing to see.there are a lot of scenes that you cannot watch it with family its no soft core but quite rude & rated r type of film there is a kissing scene between Aniston & Poulter a huge age difference between them & that spider-bite scene was the funniest one plus Jennifer Aniston plays the role of a stripper here.the plot:a drug dealer David Clark is asked by his boss to go to Mexico & get some heavy amount of marijuana & smuggle it into USA without getting caught David makes a plan by adding 3 other people to his plan to create a fake family so no one can find him suspicious.i liked this film but i saw the regular version no need to see the extended DVD version this will do just fine but beware don't show this to kids.Overall We're The Millers 2013 is a great time pass comedy film my rating is 6/10.recommended",6,0,1,8 May 2014

The Fast and the Furious," The First Film In the Series & Best One Afterall It is The Film That Started It All
","yes you read it right this is the very first film in the fast and furious series i have seen all of them even the new one furious 7 i am waiting for fast 8 but out of all i love this one.why i love this film is not just because i am a hardcore Vin diesel fan but because of the direction in this one by Rob Cohen this director is gold after this he made one more movie with Vin Diesel called Triple X aka xXx in year 2002 both of these films are proof that this guy is a master action director he is my favorite action film director along with John Woo.i don't have to tell about all the cast you know who they are but i will mention Paul walker here it is sad that he passed away few years back but his style in this film is epic,also i got into fish sandwiches & burgers because of him seriously there is one funny scene in this film that is one of my favorite nothing beats its at the start of the film when Brian come at Dom's eating place but things go wrong as he gets into the fight with Vince,the whole situation is pure hilarious with the background song called watch your back.the plot:the story of this film is very simple its about a undercover police officer Brian O Connor who infiltrates Dominic Torretoes gang because the gang is involved in stealing trucks full of expensive electronics.this film got it all right the cars the street racing & even the music,the action is slow at times but good to enjoy,this is the best one in the entire series the rest of the sequels are nowhere near to this.Rob Cohen needs a good film to direct now he is in deep mess these days.here what most i like about this film is the character of Paul walker he appears weak but watch the climax & you'll see what he does he is fearless he saves the entire team of Dom from the truck driver,he overshadowed Vin diesel here a little by his performance,don't know if he did all those stunts by himself but it was cool to watch him in action.some people hate this film & the entire fast & the furious series for no reason i say don't listen to them or critics go buy or rent all of these film there are seven of them,if you like James bond series or Mission impossible ones or even Jason Bourne ones & if you are a action junkie like me then please pick this up without a doubt it is very entertaining & worth your time.this came out in 2001 but looks fresh the picture quality is amazing too.just don't go and watch the latest ones because of the hype around them you must see this one then the rest,i know people are going crazy over furious 7 but it nice but not good as this one.Overall this film is a mix bag of comedy,romance,action & drama so my rating for The Fast & The Furious 2001 is 10/10:Recommended",10,0,1,10 February 2016
American History X," Edward Norton At His Finest
","this film is really a eye opener for every human living on this planet earth,ever since this world is created people are hating & killing each other for various reasons this film American history x 1998 is a clear example of how bad this world has become.i will not label this film as a cure & solution for the problems like racism,extremism but point is this is a deep film it is way much more then about skin color as this film is quite shocking.i saw this film for the first time once last year in 2015 and still its impact is so strong on me i have to say if you go into a debate on this film it will never end as its got so many topics & hidden messages inside it.this is a story of a white skin colored bad guy Derek Vinyard who hates black people & is at constantly war with them but most of all himself too hes got no moral values & no conscience one day he goes too far and kills some guys & goes to prison but there his life changes completely when he comes out of the prison he becomes really nice person but what worries him is the path his little brother his following.i will not tell much here you have to see the film to understand what it is about it is a very simple film mostly runs on dialogues but whats the lesson in this film for everyone i mean Derek looses everything his family his friends and gains nothing why hate yourself & others you still loose even if you win.Edward Norton is at his best here he nails the role such a fine actor this film belongs to him he was insane here what a performance,the rest actors did good job as well.American history x raises a very serious issue not just politics & racism but human behavior why humans are becoming intolerant day by day is it because of ignorance & lack of education or is it about humans are worse then animals,harsh words but true fact.Overall American History:X 1998 has everything my rating is 10/10 Highly Recommended.",10,0,1,26 June 2016
Saw III," This Is Where The Downfall Of The Franchise Begins
",In almost every film series the first part is good but hardly any sequels lives up to its name and match the standard in quality it does't matter if all the films are directed by same person or any other it depends on how good the script is and the ability of the makers to deliver the good output.This is the third installment in the series got a lot of gore and torture scenes but boring characters and jigsaw is pretty much useless here he plans a new game but this time his successor Amanda takes the legacy forward.In this film the background and little history of jigsaw is opened up and this thing will continue in the rest of the films after this which is bad in horror films it is better to film the story in chronological order otherwise it is a pure mess its not star wars.Some new cast members are added here the rest cast returns Shawnee Smith once again gives a great performance surpassing everyone else.The Plot:Jeff is held as a hostage to play jigsaw games Amanda kidnap's doctor Lynn to keep John Kramer alive.The tortures scenes are too much in it but once you start to like them you will see too many cuts made by censor same goes to paramount studio why they do this is out of my head bad editing and boring slow story with this Jeff guy was annoying plus that head surgery scene of jigsaw oh god and how can any doctor use a large circular saw machine on the head without killing the person.Overall Saw 3:2006 is a once time watch but only if you can tolerate some boring dialogs and blood otherwise stay away my rating is 5/10.,5,0,0,13 September 2014
Ocean's Eleven," All Style & no Substance & weak Script ruined this film
",oceans 11 the first film in the ocean series is about Danny ocean is a con-man(g.clooney) now after he gets out of jail he makes a plan & makes his own gang of thieves to do a biggest heist by robbing a las Vegas casino.first of all there is brad Pitt & Matt Damon here what the hell these two were doing here.they made Matt Damon a stupid guy.now the plot was great but in the middle it started to stink.they got into the casino making the owner a big fool & taking all money but its like piece of cake for them.its all easy & after that the dude threatens them i mean are you joking here the casino is robber & the guy couldn't stop them then suddenly he is so powerful that he can find them anywhere in the world.i would not like to discuss this further i just have to say this film make a huge mess of good actors like brad Pitt & Matt Damon.clooney sucks big time so i don't care my rating for oceans 11 is 1/10.an awful heist film.don't waste your money & time,1,7,14,4 January 2013
Die Hard 2," entertaining but suffers from several issues
","This die hard 2 aka die harder film is good and entertaining but suffers from issues like sound mix and bad cast specially Bonnie Bedelia why couldn't they Casted a different actress she ruined the first one and this one too it was good that they removed her character completely for the third die hard film of 1995,here is the thing in this one its about airport hijacking and making air planes crash on run way as some bad guys hacks airport systems and communications and turns all lights of the runways off making the plane pilots totally blind even with all the radar and camera systems on planes the pilots can't land the plane they need to know exactly where is the runway,now with the airport on hostage Bruce Willis as John Mclane comes to the rescue hey this got good action and some comedy but like i said earlier some technical stuff just don't work like audio quality,cast and some scenes should have been deleted for example the Mclanes wife Bonnie Bedalia and the Tv reporter they serve no purpose in this film,why do we need to see same nonsense again that we tolerated in first one the writers and filmmakers couldn't do it any differently back then until the die hard with the vengeance 1995 to get the series on track but sadly die hard 3 was the last good die hard we ever got after that the series got ruined completely still with whatever complains i have of this one it still holds enough repeat value but not as much as the first part my rating is 5/10",5,0,3,26 September 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Most Overrated Film Of All Time In The World
","Seriously how did this junk made so much money is beyond me are people really crazy they don't know what they have done,this film is pure nonsense,and i hate to say this Thanos was a total looser here also what happened to hulk its a shame people will realise this in future that what a load of crap nonsense this was a total waste of time and money,it should have not even made 50 bucks at box office that's how bad this is,Scarlet Johannson was sacrificed in this mess just so people can shed a tear and throw money at the screen ,this makes me wonder the makers and people really enjoyed killing her black widow and iron man for cash ,both of them are dead now.,besides that this film is contagious cesspool of bad Cgi ,horrible cheesy Dialogs and Cartoonish action,and they say this can match avatar 2009 avatar was a masterpiece holds great repeat value then this any day,endgame holds no value as a film at all forget about repeat value,how is this a film it does not even qualifies for direct to Disc DVD Or hallmark movie,i feel like this is a bad joke its so bad that you cannot even tell it to yourself alone my rating is 1/10.skip it do not waste your time and money on this the whole world already wasted.",1,312,554,10 July 2019
Quantum of Solace," Where Was Bond?This Is Just A Action Movie
","i mean it from the title of my review that this is just a action film like Steven segal do it, where was James bond the character we all know.Daniel Craig?is this guy even a bond? no never he lacks everything to be bond what was he doing in casino royale & in this film he doubles it. killing people without a reason,i am so sorry but please no offense to Daniel Craig fans but this movie is junk & slap to James bond fans.from start to end we see only action & Daniel Craig making weird faces like he is suffering from constipation.you people call that acting oh boy he don't say the bond lines & no gadgets but you got to be charming like brosnan did in his films.this is the story about bond going after oil & evil organization quantum controlled by Dominique green..i have casino royale & Qos on DVD but i watch it only as action film.good by to good old James bond this franchise is ruined.thanks to Barbra broccoli & Daniel Craig.my rating is 1/10 worst bond movie .watch it only as action film",1,8,11,21 November 2011
Independence Day," A Film Filled With Cool Special Effects,Aliens,Will Smith & Margaret Colin
","Roland Emmerich is a crazy guy even more then Michael bay but he is a great director who is simply wasting his talents by making bizarre films like this we all remember 2012 the 2009 film that started John Cusack the point is Roland Emmerich just sticks to same genre even after so many years its sci-fi or epic disaster films hes got all the skills for an action director could have made some bond films or regular ones like john woo makes that includes a little bit of good story and better script at disposal but no also its in the news that a sequel to this film is coming soon sometime around 2016.The Plot:the scientists are doing some research on extra terrestrial life but something goes wrong as they revive signals from aliens the panic starts when the alien mother ship enters the earth orbit & creates havoc all hope is lost everything is destroyed these events makes Captain Steven Hiller as the only man to confront the invaders.The Cast:who else is here some hot women are there specially Margaret Colin she got me hooked & second is will smith he does his best but his character is loud & exited for no reason at all in the most serious situations he is doing comedy.The film starts good the space ship design & special effects are awesome but what else is good aliens oh yes they appear too here Ridley Scott & Steven Spielberg must be proud after watching those scenes after all they invented these things.The reason most people don't like this film is why would alien attack earth thy don't need resources they were living thousands of years without them so why the need arise plus on the USA independence day wow that is absurd.The whole project turned into star trek & just missing James bond along with superman there you go a perfect crossover movie,aliens are too weak they get killed easily getting nuke later by air force.Overall Independence Day 1996 provides good laughs nothing more this came out in 96 but on the same year another movie called broken arrow starting Tohn Travolta came out which is much better any day then this my rating is 3/10:Skipp It",3,1,1,27 November 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," A Nice Film From Marvel Phase 3 That's Actually Holds Some Quality Standard
","I hate Thor films honestly i just don't care for the character its boring garbage plus its performed by one of the worst actors ever Chris Hemsworth the makes or studio should replace him and then ill might actually see one fully rather than skipping to next chapter or seek to a particular scene only Hela was good in Ragnarock thanks to Cate Blachette now coming back to this film all i have to say is that infinity war is the only watchable and repeatable film in marvel phase 3 seriously it holds some level of quality and standard the makers really pushed it and i found myself liking it,Thanos was well done here strong and cool,i just recently watched endgame 2019 and it was bad no action only talk it doesn't matter if it made huge money at box office i wont waste my cash over that kid of nonsense ill take this infinity war any day,you can see my endgame review if you click on my profile button it will take you to the main area my channel page.
i am going to make it short from here because what i am about to say might worry some people i am fan of both marvel and dc and its sad to see whats going on recently marvel still doing nice but dc is in a mess the last good dc films were the dark knight trilogy of christian bale as batman honestly,both marvel and dc comics film makers need to up their game i really hope that black widow and Eternals movies will do great in phase 4 & dc should start all over cancel justice league and wonder woman as dc movies are not working at all reboot everything again they must because if they don't then its really endgame for them not joking because guys a new comic book hero is about to enter the competition soon in the valiant comic universe based on valiant comics Vin Diesel will star as bloodshot in the film the quality level on that film will be insane it will defeat and own these kids at marvel and dc comics its going to be extreme and Rated R not for kids,so marvel and both dc should start aiming at adults,this avengers infinity war was good attempt but again they need to stop making films pg or lame for kids marvel and dc need to grow up endgame and justice league are examples of poor film making.why not make animation entirely then if they want to cater to the kids,if you are making a feature live film then better make it good,this one film showed that it was worth the effort and not really about money the acting,story everything was good,you cant go and make a comic book film without a Cgi what would that be it would be just another movie with actors acting and there are films like that out there like Jason Bourne or some Steven Seagal films etc so this one was a good mix of Cgi and live action,endgame really made me angry as everything looked out of place,infinity was set a standard and marvel blew the chance and ruined the sequel movie,always remember that a good film is not about awards or cash it made at box office its about repeat value look at the matrix trilogy of Keanu Reeves i know i am going off topic a big but yes that's how films should be made so these guys better watch out and fix their mistakes or on purpose errors,infinity war made me glued to the seat and not move for this nice film my rating is 5/10 and i love iron man.watch it",5,1,2,8 August 2019
Frozen," is frozen the most overrated animated film ever
","i saw this film this year yes it came out in 2013 i love Disney they make amazing animated films no one can beat them but after watching frozen i asked myself is this the most overrated animated film of all time & sad but true yes it is.this film failed to entertain on many levels the story was too melodramatic & boring with not even a single exiting moment plus it was a musical it was something i never expected but i did expect some great visuals but frozen looks dull & flat on animation i mean how did this film became a a hit not to mention the bad voice acting & awful background score.the plot:is there a plot here i mean 2 sisters are fighting over for stupid reasons a queen Elsa goes mad & turns the whole kingdom into ice cold Anna is no saint either she makes mistakes too if Elsa wanted to leave the mansion and go away why not leave the country or whatever why build a large ice castle where Anna would find her easily it was pointless of her to create so much havoc in first place,these characters were just stuck in a messed up loop of disaster including that annoying talking snow man Olaf his name just reminded me of Jim Carry's count Olaf in Lemony Snikets A Aeries Of Unfortunate Events 2004.the climax is so over the top hilarious it looked like a show from cartoon network from 90s frozen had its TV premiere but i missed it instead i bought the home media disc & feel cheated as this was a complete waste of time & cash.Disney films are memorable & nostalgic like Brave 2012,Finding Nemo 2003,tangled 2010 but frozen is a wasted potential they should have made a live action movie of this script it would have been better.other characters of Disney can be spotted here too anyway point is Disney has lost it dream-works & other studios are making amazing animated films Disney should be careful.Overall Frozen 2013 has nothing to see in it i would not recommend it to anyone who likes good films my rating is 2/10:skipp it",2,5,11,12 August 2015

",this film i am legend came in 2007 now i don't wanna go in some details of novels or whatever this film is a remake of.starting will smith i am legend is about a race of survival & hope.story goes as a a virus spreads & kills millions of people in the world.from start to end i am legend is highly filled with flaws & mistakes & goofs.but will smiths performance makes it go away as you watch the film you don't want to see the story you only want to see smiths acting which saves this film & gives it some points.so i will give this film 6/10 not more then that please.all credit goes to will smith.its a one time good watch,6,1,1,18 November 2011
Unknown," For Good Suspense Buildup & Liam Neeson Performance I Give 6
",here you go i am saying it from the beginning that Liam neeson was fantastic & what i liked in this film was the good suspense buildup but at some points in the film you can guess the whole plot & climax now whats that popular word everyone uses .its predictable.yes it was but not entirely at the end of the day it depends on the viewer that how he looks at it.unknown is about a biochemist who comes to Berlin with his wife but things don't go as they should.he later gets into an accident & goes into coma.the writing & execution was so fine here.the cast January Jones & Diane Kruger i am not a fan of them but they did some nice acting.but i felt climax should have been a little longer but it as satisfying for me because i had no expectations from this film.i don't like it when a critic likes or hates a film.i watched it so ill decide it.films are for people not for critics.fans of Liam neeson will like this film.overall unknown 2011 is a good watch.as the movie was shot it Germany it looked cool as ice.my rating is 6/10,6,2,3,15 May 2013
Coyote Ugly," Coyote Ugly Serves Only Decent Time Pass Nothing More
","piper perabo is one hot babe or a slut that is the line you will utter when you see any movie of her coyote ugly 2000 displays her few talents .it serves a decent time pass nothing else as i said above coyote ugly was a bar & this movie was based on that so they have tried their best but fails at many levels,let me just say this there is no movie in the world that is almost perfect the plot is about a struggling singer Violet goes to NYC to look for a job and lands at a coolest club called coyote ugly owned by LIL(maria bellow) there she has to prove herself for the job.this film is mostly shot in the club & one of the things i love to see in any film is the production quality the makers did there best here but again no focus on the script makes it rather dull.now there are some fun scenes like bottle juggling,singing & spilling wine all over the place.if it wasn't for the good cast & sexy scenes this film would be an epic fail.i liked maria bellow she reminds me of Sharon stone.anyway the DVD comes with deleted scenes & trailers & stuff but there was a lot of missing scenes including the famous Piper perabo sex scene.my rating is 5/10 watch coyote ugly only for piper pirabo, Bridget moynahan & time pass.",5,3,6,13 April 2013

Big Hero 6," The Lamest Animated Film Ever Made
",Seriously just what are these people at Disney thinking they own marvel but why are they wasting money making useless film like this with worst stories ever written big hero 6 is based on marvel comics team of 6 superheroes who save the world yeah please we have avengers already we don't need this just because the Disney is successful does not mean they should over do it i love animated films & Disney is my favorite no one comes close to them when they team up with Pixar Studios but this time they went wrong ways.Our heroes are Mashups of east & west relying on funny situations involving slapstick comic moments from start to finish doing stupidity & nonsense remove comedy & this film is nothing.The Plot:Hiro Hamada is a young guy who gets a inflatable white robot named Baymax but a villain is on the loose creating havoc in the city Hiro Hamada gets more friends to join him in the fight of good versus evil.The voice acting is awful cheesy dialogs leave the viewer to say only one quote loud & clear 'i feel cheated this is a waste of time & money'.This is the worst & dumbest robot ever the design is just like some snowman & the makers of this film are claiming that they have developed a new software for animation may i ask what it is called there is nothing new here in fact the animation seems shaky & below standard circa 1999 if anyone remembers toy story you know what i am talking about those are classics compared to this i am disappointed by this desperate move for cash by Disney the big hero 6 comics are not famous either so why bother.Is it just me or so many people are waiting for Brave 2012 & Finding Nemo 2003 sequels they could have made those but instead we got the lamest animated film ever made my rating for Big Hero 6(2014) is 3/10.Skipp It,3,97,254,19 November 2014

",I swear this is the second best film in the series but due to censorship the editing was messy it is quite unexpected but good film altogether if you forget the flaws.The story goes as jigsaw finally comes face to face with detective Eric Matthews as he trapped some people in some hidden area the police try to find the place but Eric must listen to jigsaw as his son is also trapped inside.The cast members were amazing specially Emmanuelle Vaugier & Shawnee Smith gives one hell of a performance the scene where she gets thrown in a deep pit full of injection with open needles is quite scary i love her since this film.It's got some intense scenes not for weak hearted and new traps jigsaw is one cool guy i just hated him first but that's what makes him most awesome the only one who can end jigsaw is agent 47 that person is a psycho who just don't respect this world.I wont go in must detail or discussion over this but i have to say this i have never ever liked critical reception and never will it kills cinema this is a purely audience entertainer so forget what anyones says just enjoy this.Overall Saw 2:2005 is another great film for horror fans way better then evil dead series my rating is 8/10.Recommended.,8,1,3,12 September 2014
From Dusk Till Dawn," Tarantino is a idiot colony sucks but what the hell was salma heyek doing
","you read my title summary of my review of this epic trash can classic.the cast was bad as i know it story was going good but out of nowhere i wasn't expecting the horror & Dracula stuff in the film.this is so embarrassing to watch as the film includes a guy talking about pussy & pussy all the time.we all know he was not talking about a catTarantino is a big fool who makes cheap films his pulp fiction was funny but his most films are about sex,abusive language & mindless action.this film is a great example of how sick minded people live in this world plus on top of that Hollywood makes crap like this & people praise them.i mean wow this is a shameless film.forget George colony as he sucks at acting but what was salma hayek doing there man on man she was naked dancing & eating people,the most disgusting thing she was doing.my rating for from dust till dawn is 1/10/pure awful film if you don't have any shame & morals left then this is for you.",1,7,18,26 December 2012
The Dark Knight," overrated junk
","This is some serious trash overrated junk in name of movies and comic book movies are not cinema this is a proof of it,there are tons of movies out there that deserves to be rated higher than this nonsense,and heath ledger other movies are way better then this this is horrible joker sucked so is batman this was supposed to be a batman movie but became about the bad guy joker he is not even a proper villain just so called tough guy it would take one hitman with sniper rifle to end this fool,batman also is a looser because he not kills bad guys and let innocents die,this is just bad writing as most of comic books are filled with ficitonal junk crap and they tried to makes this realistic and it works for a cash grab but not as a batman movie,,or a movie in general,this is horrible so is the new joker 2019 movie.",1,5,9,28 March 2020
Taken," Your Time Will Be Taken & Regret Will Be Given To You If You Watch This Film
","i am serious here if you watch this film your precious time will be taken & you will have nothing but regret.what made Lian Neeson join this project is money only nothing more,if you see the script of this film you will laugh its more ridiculous then a Steven sea-gal movie,i really like Steven but he is making bad movies nowadays hope he brings something new but Liam Neeson is always my favorite ever since i saw him in batman begins 2005,plus what is Famke Jansen(golden-eye 1995) doing her shes is a fantastic actress now this bad film is added into her career.look at the plot here its a good plot ruined by foolish elements thrown in the story,an ex CIA guy goes to Europe to save his beloved daughter she was kidnapped by some Albanian thugsBrayan(Liam) talks to kidnapper's & speed jumps to Paris like superman, OK i get it its a movie but didn't we all see this type of films before,Clint Eastwood made a film like that too i remember i wont compare this to other films because its a insult,the story was about the dude and his daughter so why the hell his wife and other guys are involved and where is the damn police in France,its a straight to DVD film gone theatrical id say.the cast is good,the actions scenes are worse then Wesley Snipes movie,if you like Liam Neeson and Famke Janseen then go ahead watch it otherwise stay away,its a bad film from start to end with a bad climax.My Rating is 1/10 one of the worst film of Liam Neeson so beware this film will cost you money and time,all taken nothing given.",1,8,14,10 August 2013

Saw," This First Film In The Series & Best One Yet
",This film is the very first installment in saw franchise it is also the only best film out of them all once you saw it you cant deny it just don't let kids see this film its got a lot of blood in it.If you think the joker from DC comics is evil wait till you see this guy jigsaw he is the opposite of what he does the joker only cares about himself but jigsaw don't he don't care if he lives or dies all he cares about is the legacy & always looks for someone who can continue to be his protégé & successor.The Cast:i wont mention all of them it would take some serious space and IMDb wont allow it all of them did a good job but the lead guys and Tobin Bell oh god simply brilliant.The Plot:two guys wake up in a dirty room chained to the walls with no escape area available they wonder who kidnapped them but soon the clues are slowly revealed that they have fallen prey to the jigsaw a famous serial killer who never forgives and wants his victims to play his games.Now this is a horror film its got suspense and good dialog it is a bit slow as their are no gun fights here one scene in climax when the dead guy wakes up it is a shocker i wont reveal much here neither flaws all films got mistakes but this film does manage to entertain at big level all you have to do is enjoy it without reading critic reviews.Overall Saw 2004 is one of the best film from last decade my rating is 10/10:Recommended,10,1,2,12 September 2014
Up," Not Disney & Pixar's Best But Definitely Entertaining
","I've seen a lot of animated films and cartoons since 90s there is a long list that i can write that have my favorites or some of them that i just watched to pass the time but now cartoon network,nickelodeon and other channels that used to be in there prime are now finished they lost their taste even independent and not so famous companies that are making animation have surpassed them but when it comes to Disney & specially with Pixar i have came to a conclusion these guys don't make enough films but when they do they never compromise on the quality and knows what the audience want to be honest here if anyone can beat Disney and Pixar its themselves no other can do it you name the films Finding Nemo,tangled take classics from 60s but the case with up 2009 is not the same it is good but not a Oscar material.The Plot:Carl is a 70 years old man after his wife dies when government force him to go to retirement home he embarks on a journey to south America with his house on balloons along with Russel a 8 years old boy.The Cast:Edward Asner & Christopher Plummer & many others did nice voice acting.Sure this film got its flaws,but the animation,dialog and story covers it up and when Carl lets go of his house is a lesson for those who don't want to move forward it was becoming a burden on him if you take out this scene the ending will make no sense the disappointing thing is this when i pick up a Disney film its exiting this one never made an impact maybe its the character designs or a lot of sadness thrown in i mean this is a type of a film that you wont remember for long you would just like to watch it once i did enjoyed it but at many places it seems dull.Overall Up 2009 is a decent entertaining film but one a one time watch for some people it will be boring its not a masterpiece so keep expectations below my rating is 5/10.",5,1,3,28 February 2014
Rio," One of The Best Animated Film In Recent Years
",i saw this film 2 years ago and i was moved not only because of animation was amazing but the story and characters were amazing Disney along with Pixar is famous of these things but this time fox studios & blue sky studios steals the show directed by Carlos Saldanha this motion picture of amazing birds will amaze you anytime.the plot:blue is a male macaw parrot from Rio DE Janeiro Brazil smuggled to USA a girl named Linda adapts him as he is growing up he is still unable to fly but soon blue;s life changes as he gets ready to make a trip to Brazil.the cast:everyone did a good job in voice acting i wont name any actors here it will take time.yes there are few annoying scenes in it but the flaws are overshadowed by great comedy specially the little bird and all the beautiful scenes of Brazil there is a sequel to this film called Rio 2 2014 do see that one too its the second best film in the series 10 years before this film came out the company Lu launched the biscuits named Rio in Pakistan when this film came up i jumped about the same name in excitement but they have promoted Rio 2 everywhere that is a good move.Overall Rio 2011 is a underrated film made with pure heart it is one of the best film release recently go watch it its not for kids only if your above 100 years old you will still love it my rating is 10/10:Recommended,10,1,1,17 April 2014
Invincible," Its official Mark Wahlber Cannot Act
","this film proves it all the time he was on screen making faces like he suffered from diarrhea.the story of a 1970s era gone real badthis is a sports film starting mark whalberg & Elizabeth banks,the story of Vince papale if you don't know who he is Vince is the real life American footballer who played with Philadelphia eagles now i am not American myself & don't watch football but i do know sports a lot i did not know Vince papale before this movie introduced me to him.Vince(mark) is a bartender & wins a Chance to be in the football team.if you search for this film after you seen it its different from what happened in real. the movie changed everything & claims to be the best film what a joke this is.every five minutes we see mark wahlberg crying out loud & to be honest i don't like these types of films.it was extremely boring & the action i was expecting never came they used some old footages of the game.& the only this i started to like was Elizabeth banks she was gone after a kissing scenes plus it makes a foreigner lost interest in football watching films like this.just Skipp this film for your good.might as well go for the real football stadium & enjoy a match there this movie is a waste of time.my rating is 1/10 invincible is for incapable only.",1,1,7,18 November 2012
The Fountain," Only God Knows What In The Blue Hell They Were Smoking
","yes you read my title summary .they were not high they were inside mountains of Venus,mars or Pluto or on some hidden universe that no one knows dammit what inspired them to make this movie.starting Hugh Jackman oh boy the whole movie i feel sad for him he was crying a lot & needed in the movie story he is a scientist & on his dream world or some weird area he is trying to be a bald saint who loves a tree. and Rachel wiesz never looked so beautiful she looked great but this whole thing is messed up there was no chemistry that would keep me interested in the movie.just hold it right there what was the movie about the plot is that involves science & tree of life & Mayan religion.holy crap its a mixture of mambo jumbo crap that the fountain makers tried to shove down our brain holes that right it exists.now these guys should have gone to prison for making mockery out of someones religion,i don't care if this movie was made on facts or fiction.this was A plus grade embarrassing for everyone.i watched this a few days ago & believe me i flipped out.this is crazy .who would be so crazy to watch this.I've learned my lesson not to buy up random dvds from the store.my rating is 1/10 an awful price I had to pay for being a Hugh Jackman fan .sir please don't do this again & how the hell did this movie went to golden globe awards.",1,2,6,14 July 2012

Die Hard," Remove Yellow Camera Tint Along With Bonnie Bedalia & This Holds A Good Repeat Value
","I have my view of films its not about how much a film is famous or how much money or how many awards it won it does not matter at all,it is always about repeat value that's what matters,now with that aside here is my problem with this film specially the first 2 this one and second one that is about airport plane hijack,in both films the colour tone is bad specially this one too yellow and dull for my taste the second big problem is the actress Bonnie Bedalia first of all who made her a actress is beyond me officially she was the worst actress ever also Annoying ,affects the pace of the film and makes me angry every time i see her on screen and listen to her talk i simple hate her ,the last part of this film really made me mad that scene with a TV reporter and her ,it should have been removed totally deleted,die hard suffers from this mess otherwise what are you seeing this for its Bruce Willis the man himself ,the Villain Alan Rickman makes the slowest entry but worth it,and who can forget the rooftop famous funny pizza scene with policewoman on the phone the banter between them is hilarious and one of the top 10 funny moments in films in my list and opinion,over all this first part is nice to watch but then again the issue with sound is fine its mixed well but the video and camera tint it feels kind of you know,you can say i judged this film too harsh well its because i have seen it many times too,so here is my criticism of it and that fat cop good for nothing character what does he do he does nothing why is he in this,i wish there is a fan made re-cut of this film or something where all the Bonnie Bedalia scenes and fat cops scenes are edited out of this film and colour tone fixed,that's my wish. so my advice is if you don't want to be bored or tortured skip all Bonnie Bedalia scenes it does not do die hard any justice this film she deserves to be skipped and deleted because die hard fans of this film wants to watch die hard without any nonsense and she is big one my rating is 7/10.",7,0,4,10 July 2019

12 Years a Slave," One Of The Best Film Made About Salvery & Racism
","This film came out last year and it won Oscars i would not go it that detail that was this film really an Oscar worthy or not but the point is this project gives us something underrated the acting and direction is top notch here its based on Solomon Northup real life biography published in late 18th century the theme is racism and slavery, to be very honest and simple if anyone don't like this film clearly don't have a heart,this thing happened in real life and the sad thing was the bad guys escaped and not convicted i saw this film and searched more about Solomon Northup i wonder what happened one can think maybe the kidnappers got him again and killed him who knows that is why his whereabouts remain a secret i also saw Django Unchained i think its the same house used as in this film over there was Leonadro Dicaprio giving his best but here is Chiwetel Ejiofor stealing the show with is brilliant performance but both films raise the same topic but this is more serious then one can ever imagine there maybe more films like this but this one is a gem.The Plot:Solomon Northup is from upstate new york a well traveled man he gets kidnapped and soled as a slave for 12 years.The Cast:there is a huge talented cast assembled here the best actors of our times i can name them all but i have to mention Brad Pitt & Chiwetel Ejiofor my god this man nailed the role.No film is without flaws OK the director Steve McQueen did his job perfectly the thing is slavery and racism is never good the final moments of this film when Brad Pitt's character talks about the issue it was golden words harsh but true i loved this film its the second best after Mandela:Long Walk To Freedom 2013 by Idris Elba.Overall 12 Years A Slave 2013 is one of the best film made recently its a tale that once again tells the world that stop racism,hatred & slavery but in some parts of the world it still goes on its not a film its a lesson for all of us humanity is above all.My Rating Is 10/10 A Must See:Highly Recommended.",10,5,9,11 March 2014

The Wolf of Wall Street," The Most Hilarious Film Martin Scorsese Ever Made
","Based on life of Jordon Belfort i am not going in detail of who he is look him up there were films like this before if you remember boiler room,wall street both parts directed by Oliver Stone now this film comes from Martin Scorsese a director i really hate and don't like any of his films except Goodfellas a bit only because of Ray Liotta and i wont say i have enjoyed this one because of story,nudity,sex,drugs,abusive language etc which is all that in this film i liked this because of some comedy and acting by Leonardo DiCaprio oh yes if this director has made anything funniest ever its this film.The Plot:Jordan Belfort rises on top as the richest stockbroker on wall street he got everything but money made him blind and the aftermath leads him getting involved in crimes,fraud & Corruption.Its been done before in countless films money loving guy gets a good wife and booze all day opens a big office on his own then trips only to fall in a deep mess but the point is regardless of what is shown in this film there is enough humor here to keep you hooked and the dialogs and performance by Leo is extremely hilarious he crossed limits even leaving behind Nicolas cage.The runtime is near 3 hours long its been said that directors cut is 4 hours longer this was a paramount release it upsets me that a studio like that never releases uncut versions of hits like Mi2 2000.The Cast:Leonardo Dicaprio Stole the show,Margot Robbie looked nice but the big disappointment was Jonah Hill keep overacting the rest cast is passable.Overall The Wolf Of Wallstreet 2013 may offend many people because of the content and it may seem unrealistic and many points its got it flaws but that doesn't make it not worth watchable if your looking for some good comedy try this one my rating is 5/10.",5,1,3,3 March 2014

Taken 2," Taken 2 Is A Sole Disappointment For Liam Neeson Fans
","as a Liam Neeson fan i have seen a lot of him films & he is a great actor but in his career he did choose some bad scripts & unfortunately taken is one franchise in it in case someone mistakes this to be a taken video game movie its not & Liam Neeson is definitely not into Kung-Fu at all.i have seen taken 1 2008 did the review here it was a bad film but taken 2 is a pure disappointment for any action fan.the plot:a guy goes on vacation with his wife & daughter to turkey somehow he gets kidnapped and asks her daughter to escape the hotel & help him.story problem:her daughter goes on top of roofs in turkey shooting & throwing bombs with no sign of police anywhere,this was a on purpose joke by makers on turkey same like part 1 in Paris i guess there is no law enforcement in these countries,the villains appear tough but fails easily.the cast included Famke Janssen her career is done i mean it from Goldeneye to X-Men & many more till 2008 her movies were great but cant blame her either movies now-days provides only mindless entertainment.the action scenes are designed like its from some TV-show,it will be hard to differentiate for any action fan who expect a Liam Neeson film & looks like they are watching a Steven Seagal or a Christian Slater movie.I've heard about taken 1 reviews and fans say that its way better this i don't agree its the same as this one I've seen taken 1 it was set in Paris now here its set in turkey with director having no clue about the country Albanian's,Arabs,Muslims there is no doubt about it if anyone hurries to make a film to grab some cash,the script goes loose & audience suffers.i am not gonna go further here on this but only say that staying away from this franchise taken 1 & 2 is the best thing,go check out other Liam Neeson movies.My Rating is 1/10 taken 2 is unsatisfying & does no count in to be watched even one time..skip it",1,1,1,10 August 2013
The Woman in Black," Stunning Visuals,Great Suspense & Atmosphere Created But Could Have Been More Better
","I saw this film today & i have to say horror genre is fading away soon i have seen plenty i wont go into that detail but recently in 2012 this film came and was liked by many but this is a remake of 1989 film and an adaptation of a novel by Susan hill i have not seen the original 80s version but this is a decent enjoyable one its got everything for a usual horror or a ghost movie first of all the visuals are amazing the way it is shot by director James Watkins is brilliant second main thing is the atmosphere & suspense mood creation is no easy job the team selected some best locations & the mansion required for the scenes and guess what guys it worked.The Plot:Arthur is a lawyer who makes a trip to a village where a mysterious figure known only as the woman in the black is feared by the people,what is the secret behind this will Arthur figure it out or will become a prey to the hunter the answer is in this film.The ghost can bee seen in a black dress only by the hero Arthur people will complain its been done before but we have to remember this is based on the novel so cant help it are the three words come to mind,the main problem with this film is that it once again relies on shocking scary moments,images & loud sounds this thing is so overdone that one may cringe about that it could have been a better film without these elements,also the climax is disappointing to be honest unexpected & not true to the source material.This maybe another masterpiece in technical department but fails one the solid script level it will be a cult classic i can guarantee that for sure & for the cast Ciaran Hinds is one creepy guy he scares me i have seen his many films but Daniel Radcliffe rocked it,one more thing i like to add is when Daniel puts his hand on the window the ghost screams & she kinda looked like Sandra Bullock this made me laugh out so hard it was the funniest goof added in the most serious film ever.But Overall it is a watchable film one time only for Daniel fans so my rating for The Woman In The Black 2012 is 4/10.",4,0,0,4 August 2014

Craig not only lack all points that what it takes to be 007 he just kills random people like die hard style movies.plus the guy has no class in style ..Daniel Craig copies Sean Connery and timothy Dalton they were fantastic bonds in their Era.& no he cannot touch Pierce Brosnan because Brosnan is Golden bond he holds the class & signature of bond and he proved it in his era from Goldeneye till die another day. .the plot gets stretch for no reason it was all about money,who wins looses and more enemies comes for bond. i tried my very best to enjoy this but i could not its not entertaining at all i felt something was missing & i don't understand why this became a huge hit.people waste so much money on useless movies. by the way Daniel Craig is not bond at all he looks like a henchmen .in the climax he shoots his way through he could have sneak behind bad guys.the writer tried to show that bond is the hulk with big muscles & can kill anyone ?? i are you serious this is not a James bond movie at all it look like a playboy film or other overrated movie. overall i would say that this reboot of the franchise destroyed bond legacy .many people love it but not true bond lovers like me accept this.my rating is 1/10 worst movie and worst James bond ever",1,5,10,9 September 2011
Speed," The Film That Put Keanu Reeves On The World Map
","Keanu Reeves is one of my most favorite actors ever since i have seen him in matrix back in early 2000s he is not only good looking but can do some serious action & knows the method of dialog delivery specially the timing at proper time not many actors do that,this film came in 1994 i was 4 but if i was older i would have loved to see this in the theater but now thanks to the disc it provides good entertainment,Keanu did some films before this but hardly anyone knew him until director Jan De Bont made his directorial debut in united states,this film put him onto the world map.Many filmmakers also took inspiration from this film including Indian Cenima in 90s but none comes close to this stunt fest filled carnival ride.The Plot:Jack is a policeman who is at race against time to save the city from disasters first the elevator,then second thing is a bus which is going to its destination with passengers inside it there is a bomb planted if the speed slows down below 50 the bus will explode & later the underground train all this is happening because of one man Howard Payne who feels cheated by L.A police department as they fired him and did not gave him enough money.The Cast:great cast i must say all the cops,passengers & Dennis Hopper was a weaker villain but way better then joker in the dark knight 2008,Keanu Reeves did an amazing job here he looks fit & sexy in the role as for Sandra Bullock she was simply stunning her reaction when she is driving the bus & hits a baby carriage filled with cans is excellent.I wont go in much detail because there is not point i have to say one thing only that this movie includes some of the best stunts ever this is not a john woo film as woo is a action master but this director created a great impact in Hollywood & elsewhere worldwide in 90s.Overall this is way better then die hard series any time Bruce Willis rocks but this is ultra exiting then those installments my rating for Speed 1994 is 8/10.A Must See",8,1,3,5 August 2014
Live Free or Die Hard," unnecessary action
","With this 4th die hard film they did unnecessary action scenes that has nothing to do with the plot and let us look at the plot this came out in 2007 this does not feel like a die hard film at all why was this even made it was not needed the original trilogy is still the best i mean cyber and internet thing oh please the tunnel scene is the only best part with helicopter crash car jump sequence that stunt is well done now lets move to the building fight scene with Maggie Q it is the worst of Maggie Q she was wasted here and then the climax with planes and missiles just too much this looked like a video game then a movie .nothing comes close to the first part the 2nd and 3rd die hard films are watchable any day then this torture but one worst thing fox studio did is Casted Timothy Olyphant as the bad villain guy and he got wasted here and does not look like a believable bad guy his character is badly written getting outsmart by Mclane i told you the worst thing fox did but what did fox studio did best was here it is they put timothy Olayphant in Hitman 2007 film which was the best thing ever they did that film just put him on the world map as agent 47 its not masterpiece but way better then this,and what can i say about the other cast here Bruce Willis looked out of shape and the other guy he has to save i don't know the actor name Justin Long something who plays the computer hacker or genius he fails hard at acting the worst, and his daughter he have to save its cringe the actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead is horrible who caster her and why she is the actress in the industry who made her a actress and gave her access to movies she cannot act and ruined the whole film, some people are having issue with this film with pg rating or r i don't not care if its R or PG 13 or NC 17 or whatever its just bad direction and boring blood or no blood violence or no violence if a film fails to catch my attention span and do not have any repeat value it doesn't matter i wont watch it again so this movie can go to hell my rating is 1/10",1,0,3,26 September 2019
Lucy," Juicy:Luc Besson Again Fails In Science Fiction Genre
","This man Luc Besson used to be a good director specially in the 90s films like Nikita & Leon the professional were great but he tried to get into this science fiction genre something that is not his style & very different from action movies that he makes he fails again his first was the fifth element 1997 starting Bruce Willis it was one of the worst film ever made now this is his second worst Lucy 2014 there are many reasons for it.First of all not everyone can make a successful Sci-Fi or a Superhero film, even directors like Christopher Nolan are afraid of it so far Steven Spielberg & James Cameron are at top of the game because they started the trend aping other films without using some brain one will always end up making a film about brain capacity,i am not saying the action was bad or even the direction was below average it is the story that just don;t work a lot of matrix & homage to famous films can be spotted here easily specially limitless of Bradley Cooper,it tries very hard to entertain but could not do so.The Plot:Lucy is a young lady who works in Taiwan she gets a job to deliver some drug to a drug lord,things don't workout as she is used as a source by the mob the drug is kept inside her stomach to deliver it for sales,but the package leaks inside her & gives insane powers to Lucy allowing her to use the maximum limit of her brain.I am surprised at critics who are even comparing this film & character to others films & comic book villains like Galactus,are these people kidding please just put Lucy in-front of Doomsday,Dormamu or super-boy prime she will get killed instantly she is no match for Galactus the cosmic king.Here is the joke in the story when Lucy become powerful enough & attacks everyone she can also figures out what is going to happen next & use her instincts then why she needs help of professor Norman why not do it on your own,to be honest these flicks with women as Femme Fatales are getting old now in the 90s it was fantastic to see women in action its something these skinny ladies cant do no matter how hard they try.If these makes had some brain cells left they would know that this so called theory of how much humans use their brain is bogus now,there is no need to make a film about it,& the climax was hilarious when Lucy goes back in past generations even meeting monkeys,dinosaurs & etc.The Cast:Scarlett Johansson this lady is a great actress but now doing bad roles like black widow in dull movies,she keeps this up soon the direct to home cinema is waiting for her,Morgan Freeman looks confused here wondering why did i sign this film up there is nothing in his character that would showcase his talents besides he did some similar roles like this before.This film title should have been Juicy instead of Lucy as there is a lot of expired juice spilled inside the project by Luc Besson.Overall if you love Scarlett Johansson then do try watching this otherwise stay away my rating for Lucy 2014 is 3/10.",3,10,27,29 July 2014
The Purge," Ethan Hawke Embarases Himself In Pure Goof Film
","the title of the film is The Purge or should i say Pure Goof the poster shows that it could be a medical drama of course its not its a mash-up genre film created to make the audience mad with elements of suspense,supernatural activity & crime drama,upon watching this i was thinking only about one man from start to finish Ethan Hawke why did he choose this,does he want to end his career a great actor like him in a D Grage confused film that really don't go anywhere by totally ripping of recent horror & supernatural films like the paranormal activity series,the conjuring,dark skies & hostage 2005 starting Bruce Willis,i say hostage is more entertaining then this any-day.the plot does it matter not really;things are already bad when us government imposed an annual 12Hr rule where crime is totally legal & no help can be called no police,no service at all because of the uncontrollable crime,during this the family of James Sandin comes under attack how they will defend themselves you'll have to see.do you really have to see i mean i am not talking about critics i hate critical reception,& where is batman i bet he gets killed,robbed or on a vacation in some remote island because of the nonsense shown here even he wont stop these people,as an audience member & a film lover i love horror,romance & any type of genre,i watch films from all over the world but this really made me sad that what is cinema coming to.here are some few problems in recent films from 2005 till date i have seen in films that regardless of the genre & story the makers include ridiculous characters even if it is a serious film it just had to have a girl and sex or kissing scenes,if they say hey its a soft core porn film everyone will be happy,why is this stupid stuff necessary i ask,cant they show a film plain & simple that stays true to the story so please spare us from the mess.the cast:forget it there is no actor here that you will find acting except a good actor Ethan Hawke gets ruined here sir if you read this don't do a film like this ever,Adelaide Kane is a new actress but they made her a slut here,rest cast gets wasted.the makers failed here the whole project is muddled it cant decide what category it wants to fall in.My Rating For The Purge 2013 Is 1/10 you can watch scary movie series or goof around with your friends your time will be saved,Skipp this is my recommendation.",1,1,2,6 October 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Fog,Monkeys,Tick Tock,Birds & Some Comedy Sums Up This Film
","Catching Fire 2013 is a sequel to the hunger games 2012 adapted from novels of the same name if you have not seen the first part don't bother you don really need to see that film to understand this this sequel very much explains it all what happened in the prequel.The Plot:Katniss is back in action after her victory in hunger games she goes on a victors tour to visit all districts of Panem as snow makes changes to the hunger games but Katniss faces serious problems on a rematch between all the previous winners.The Cast:Jennifer Lawrence was out of shape and weak she looked like Jcvd from hard target,Woody Harelson & Phillip Seymor Hoffman were nice to see as rest cast is passable.These films got action suspense but it tries too hard to be serious if there is Rambo 5 please cast Jennifer Lawrence her character does almost same stuff that he does a lot of people like battle royal over this one can see why when i saw hunger games in 2012 and felt disappointed i hoped the sequel would be better but its got same thing repeated again a few plus points are monkeys fighting,the big clock in the sea a girl yelling Tick Tock and some black birds or crows whatever those things were there is plenty of hilarious comedy from almost everyone in the cast plus whoever wrote the dialogs was smoking something very high.Overall The Hunger Games:Catching Fire 2013 is a let down some scenes are watchable rest is boring my rating is 3/10:Skipp It",3,10,20,25 February 2014
Godzilla," All The Hype:Godzilla 1998 Is The Only Best Film In The Franchise
","truly its only the hype that people are falling for this reboot i was exited i am not a fan of the franchise but since it Japanese i have seen the Godzilla 1998 version of jean reno believe me it rocks compared to this i saw this & got disappointed its a 2 hours long film with time wasted on investigation but when Godzilla does starts to make an appearance the whole film goes black it made me dizzy no use of light then it shifts to daytime we a lot of destruction caused building destroyed & Godzilla isn't even in the film he appears in the climax just for about hardly 6 minutes why these makers hired director Gareth Edwards & he Will direct the sequel also the series got ruined they should have chosen Christopher Nolan for this he would have made it awesome.the plot:Godzilla is the result of atomic bomb radiation he soon comes out of hiding to earths surface wreaking havoc how can this unstoppable monster be stopped the answer is in this film.the cast:thanks to Elizabeth Olsen for some good acting i kept looking at her she is a scene stealer,& the rest cast who are these people but one main actor is missing its Godzilla himself who just comes in the end throw a blue flame on another monster then disappears.the special effects were good but that is not worth it i hope they remove this director & bring a new one i tried my best to enjoy it but when it was over i was feeling bored again.Overall Godzilla 2014 is a pure disappointment for fans.my rating is 3/10.skipp it.",3,5,11,24 May 2014
Deadpool," something i like to get off my chest
","Ok guys there is something bothering me and i think its time i should get it off my chest and share with all the users here,so here it is i am seeing some propaganda and negativity on the launch Of Valiant Comic Universe film Bloodshot and more films that will follow that propaganda and hate includes hate on Vin Diesel,Director Dave Wilson and other cast members and specially Valiant and Sony pictures studios like i was reading a article full or hate on this worst website named Tv over mind and the article was can Vin diesel bring popularity to bloodshot and the moment i clicked on it and read the full thing on that website it was mentioned here as a external site .it was full or baseless ignorance filled hateful rant of first time directors that why bloodshot will fail as a film or stupid ignorant things like who in the world knows Vailant comics and first time director would not work or fail,so here is my answer to those idiots is this film dead pool why people forget that this film one of the biggest hit films of this decade and most popular is directed by a first timer Tim Miller now the guy has also directed terminator dark fate which is about to release soon so why this ignorance on these blogs and review sites,just look at how insane this film was R Rated brutal and got best action cheesy but yes lovely i understand the Criticism but somethings are beyond Criticism its like hate for no reason why is that and hey the movie is not even released yet and those people are comparing bloodshot and Valiant with marvel and dc saying it cant compete i mean common they are dead wrong,look at what this dead pool film did biggest box office collection so i think the only way any movie can shut the mouth of haters is box office draw and collection so this hate on Vin diesel is wrong and that website should be ashamed for writing that dirty article and that author tom or whatever his name is or was,pure wannabes floating on internet typing anything the want talking about being cynical they way the put hate on others and Vin diesel i would say they are the once who is cynical and hateful .dead pool got same hate because of people like that.and vVn diesel is not cynical at all even if he is hes got every right to be.these wannabes also said that it cant be compared with classic like Robo Cop or the crow .how the hell is trash like Robo Cop is a classic its garbage a cheap wannabe copy of the terminator hell it is not even in the league of terminator someone should tell those juniors before writing the article and trying to damage the movie and companies who are making it.,this is some big frustration these guys have it and it don't go away,the hate on Sony is because of crappy spider man movies they need to drop the licence right on those and let Disney make them since they now own marvel and fox ,the hate for Sony is about to end as bad boys 3 is about to hit the theatres,its golden days are coming back and bloodshot will shut the mouth of haters just like dead pool did ,Vin Diesel is the biggest draw at box office so saying it not he is not wont change the fact that he is the biggest action hero and biggest box office opener in the world with or without the franchise.so guys beware of that propaganda against bloodshot and also this dead pool or any other director who is directing for first time or any new comic book film company,Vin diesel is popular and world famous so he doesn't not need to bring any popularity to bloodshot it will come automatically he don't need to do over marketing or any other nonsense its diesel time.so haters can go to hell for spreading negativity,propaganda and hate and nonsense as for dead pool its a classic and bloodshot will be another classic just wait and watch .7/10.dead pool is a cool awesome film people need to see this before running their mouth about others this is a example,for bloodshot Dave Wilson said that in his own words let try not be be marvel or dc or any other lets make our own world and he is right valiant will make its own audience hey i am a marvel and dc fan and now valiant so why the hate,and those guys who are saying that who the hell in the world knows valiant nobody in world knows and hating on it well their dreams are about to be shattered.everyone knows valiant and soon the whole world will erupt when the see bloodshot on the big screen.forget the hate dc,marvel valiant all are good in their own way .no comparison should be made that's what i say because they are different unique and great in their own way.",7,0,3,13 September 2019
300," Absured & Ridiculous But Worth Watchable For Zack Snyder's Direction
","i have waited a long time to review this film i was actually waiting for the sequel to this called rise of an empire starting Eva Green i have now seen both films this films is only watchable because of direction by Zack Snyder he is one of the best recently he made man of steel 2013 a superman film i totally love this film came in 2006 its based on comic books of same name by Frank miller its also a fictionalized story about real life events that involved Greeks,Persians etc there maybe historical inaccuracies in the story and it got negative reviews in Iran one can see why 300 is filled with flaws also quite absurd & ridiculous at many places,its shot in a weird way a lot of slow motion & lens color is golden throughout the film plus who can forget the famous this is Sparta line.the plot:in 480 BC king Leonidas leads 300 men force across Thermopylae to fight the Persians.the cast:a huge cast was assembled here but Lena Headey and Gerard Butler deserve a mention i never like Gerard butler movies they are usually boring but when he gets a funny or a crazy character i do try to see it.a lot of action and men in weird clothes running around specially King Xerxes the guy with the golden underwear this film does get hated but it doesn't mean its not watchable its quite entertaining but not to be taken seriously it looks like a parody of other films like gladiator.overall 300:2006 is a film for only Zack Snyder fans & art house cinema lovers my rating is 4/10.",4,1,3,20 May 2014

","this is it these parody films and wannabe spy genre films has got to stop because this is what ruins the original franchise and makes fun of it shame on these people i cannot even dream about someone making fun of Sean Connery and his bond but people did it the reason is no person on this earth is cool as him Sean is not a actor but the definition of man itself period.however this film makes fun of Pierce Brosnan 007 era films with exploding pens and gadgets etc Brosnan is a boss he redefined spy genre the makers of Kingsman should be sued for this blasphemy.i don't care if it is rated r or pg 13 i saw this film and i got angry specially with sir Samuel.L.Jackson i lost respect for him i mean how is this classic method actor can do this film from pulp fiction to pure pg 13 garbage stuff i got exited when i saw him being funny but by the time climax came his death scene is the funniest moment in the entire film he was embarrassing himself.just what the hell is going on these days is Hollywood running out of ideas they have same story lines over and over again repeating same thing million times what is wrong with these people kids with guns using bad language and violence for no reason even killing animals what a shameful era we are living in.let me clear this up a bit this is not a snuff,porn or exploitation film filled with sex but even those have some bloody standard at least they are serious about it and makers know what they are making but this one is nonsense Mathew Vaughn made just one good film in his life probably his last best too it is called layer cake with Daniel Craig check that out guys if you have not but avoid this crap please.the plot: let us look at the plot here it goes as a spy agency hires kids so they can battle evil villains who are about to destroy the world.oh please why drag kids and teens into this kids already ruined Wrestling attitude era this is coming from a 90s kid Batista and John Cena acts in lame movies too because they still aim it for kids ala guardians of galaxy etc parents are proud of it but the hypocrisy is that people hate Kristen Stewart and Dakota fanning when they do goo serious dramatic films.special Vfx,cgi effects,gore goes useless the dialogs are so cheesy it makes cartoon network looks like history channel this is high time minus point this film looses it.people are asking for a refund me too but who will listen if films like these are still coming out whatever this is Hollywood or British production it is the direction sucked big time so my question with critics and people is how dare all of you hate John Woo,Ang Lee & Ridley Scott these guys are legends and their movies are gold hey even a Tinto Brass movie is better then Kingsman any day Colin Firth was crazy for cash yes there are some hot sexy women here but wasted.for people who want a great spy film watch Mi2:2000 or for comedy try Rush Hour 2 as for action go back and try drunken master or matrix trilogy even but stay way from this guys don't believe the hype critics are blind i am waiting for bad boy 3 Michael Bay will show these kids how real action is done.overall Kingsman:The Secret Service 2015 is the worst film of 2015 my rating is 1/10.Skipp It save your money & time please i have wasted mine.",1,111,220,20 February 2015

Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," this is one hell of an overrated film
","directed by Neil Jordan & based on a novel this film interview with a vampire:the vampire chronicles 1994 is one hell of an overrated film no doubt the direction is fantastic but the script & characters are bland & uninteresting i do like some of the vampire genre films specially the underworld film series starting Kate Bekinsale as a huge tom cruise fan i expected way too much out of this film & got disappointed i do enjoy some slow paced films but here the characters were just going nowhere this film only runs because of some good acting by its strong cast with best artists of our times like Tom Cruise,Brad Pitt,Antonio Banderas,Christian Slater & Kirsten Dunst all of these actors seem to take their roles way to seriously like some soap opera & frankly speaking this is one boring film with nothing memorable or exiting except maybe Tom Cruise's character turn point as a villain.plot:the story of this film goes as a journalist gets a inside peek of vampire(brad Pitt) about his life by interviewing him.the bugging thing is the whole plot mostly surrounds around Claudia(Kirsten Dunst)she becomes a object or some toll for these vampires to play around with it's a total sandwich situation.these people just had to pick all of the sexiest men of all time & put them in a movie together but its not worth it they don't get to showcase their talents here at all all of them are forced suck blood or shout with weird expressions Kirsten Dunst's & Brad Pitt's chemistry never works brad's character is also looking for some sympathy from audience as every single moment.the film tries hard enough to appear as some tear Jerker or some tragic tale of loneliness but it fails hard even to justice to its own genre it is loaded with near 2 hours of ultimate nonsense with a mix of some Clint Eastwood western films as for the dialogs only Kirsten Dunst was making sense in the entire film as something good for written for her.i am not twilight fan but those films are at least watchable any day then this poor quality project its was real hard to sit through this mess and why the hell is it rated r there was no such thing other then some naked ladies its got not action no romance Tom Cruise was forced into doing this he looked totally out of shape here but he is a cool guy this type of characters don't suit him.almost everything about this film film fails to connect with audience no matter how hard one tries to enjoy it.Overall Interview With A Vampire:The Vampire Chronicles 1994 has nothing to see in it my rating is 3/10:Skipp It",3,2,5,26 July 2015
Spectre," Why I Think James Bond Is No Longer A Interesting Character
","James bond 007 was the character that started it all the evolution of action film since 1962 to 2002 the character worked & the films were great entertainment because James bond was larger then life but ever since Daniel Craig took over the franchise since 2006 James bond sucks i mean it these producers specially Barbra Broccoli ruined this franchise.the camera pans across Daniel Craig's face on occasion,this is great because it gives the audience ample opportunity to see his acting abilities which are equal to that of a shovel.the idea of realism is copied from Jason Bourne movies mixed with batman films the result was Daniel Craig a Jason Bourne wannabe with no class no charm no style no sense of humor & above all a terrible actor who looks like a waiter from a cheap restaurant then a British secret agent.beware watching Spectre may cause loss of brain cells its a lot worse then drinking alcohol.there is no story here if you look at the plot it stinks this is just a cheap film that mocks those classic bond films the makers are not even sure how to take the franchise ahead they are stuck between realism & past they just cant decide if they want a new direction or not.the reboot absolutely murdered the legacy of James bond they tried to revive a great character from past Bolfeld & ruined him too,the story of Spectre starts right after events of Skyfall.story:bond is on a personal mission to find out about Spectre & its leader Blofeld.what they did here is that they made Blofeld somehow related to bond are you kidding me whoever came up this idea should be in prison the script sucks.bond was trying hard to be tough here but got beaten so badly by Hinx in the train i mean what load of BS is this hard to believe this is the same bond guy from casino royalthe score and music made me deaf the worst bond song ever this Sam Smith guy can sing in a she-male voice wow standards have gone this low.the action is dull bond & Hinx in the car chase & later that airplane sequence both end up in disaster specially plane sequence bond could have shot Hinx while he was unconscious but no he was so busy in the girl Madeleine.the climax is hilarious bond visits Blofeld gets captured then escapes via explosive watch the whole desert base with pipelines explodes bond somehow escapes the area using a chopper few hours later the same night M & Q finds there is a mole in the agency but Blofeld is already in city of London he captures the chick in the same old building destroyed by Silva & plants a bomb there the bomb explodes & the boat chase starts with James chasing Blofeld over River Thames he shoots down the Helli with pistol it crashes on the road but still Blofeld survives that bond points a gun at him almost killing him point blank range but alas! bond spares his life even after all the trouble this villain has caused him over the years.the cast sucks first of all this Christoph Waltz guy is overrated he is nowhere near good as Blofeld like Telly Savalas & Charles Grey,Lea Seydox is just a eye candy & Monica Belluci my god what have these people done she appears for few minutes for what just getting laid her talents and wasted & Daniel Craig damn this guy is a insult to James bond persona he also co producer he only does these films for money he has no interest in the series those who blindly follow him have not idea he made a fool out of everyone who thinks of him being the best bond truth is he don't give a damn yes this is the reality of Daniel Craig,the only bonus point was Ralf Fieness and his funny one liners like He he says Cocky Little Bastard that's some comedy i was not expecting,and Dave Bautista as evil Hinx was good here but got killed soon and easily.Q and Moneypenny look like street junkies then James Bond helpers and may i ask what happens to Stephanie Sigman she was the only good girl in this film its sad she didn't have many scenes in the film. from start to finish this film is a drag the makers do not care about fans at all they want cash,they want Oscars which by the way have no value at all and are not given on merit.Piece Brosnan was the last true bond after Timothy Datlon & Sean Connery who did a fantastic job as 007 during his run.its sad to see this franchise in a mess bond is no longer the fun over the top smart one man army hero we all loved,other films are becoming bond then bond itself now take a look at Mission Impossible series Tom Cruise keeps surpassing everyone doing some of the most insane stunts himself & the scripts are gold.after this shameless film i no longer consider myself a James Bond fan Spectre is a film for hippies,all those tribute scenes like gadget car etc they are useless i am not impressed as the film offers nothing new it continues from the previous films.Spectre could have been a decent watchable film if bond was on a new mission this personal vendetta is too much,its been more then 10 years and we are stuck with this nonsense.Overall my rating for Spectre 2015 is 1/10 this is the fourth worst bond film in Daniel Craig era it is so pointless all the budget is wasted on style & cinematography instead of a proper script:Skipp this awful torture save your time and money.",1,1,4,19 March 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," This Film Almost Killed The Franchise
","a lot of people hate Michael bay for what he makes but i do like him he is a great director but sometimes greatness do fall this film is the perfect example of rise & fall john woo used to make great films when his last film paycheck 2003 came it was a sci-fi movie not the genre & area woo would touch but still it came out as a better film despite the hate.same is with this now what went wrong with this project is bad it happens you cant do anything about it. i saw bays recent film this year pain & gain 2013 it was totally worthless,let me tell something here that most people & audience will never tell .what makes a great filmmaker is not the direction & not the plot handling its the final execution that makes one the best i am not talking about the director only also the writers.there are plenty of movies out there with a bad start & the buildup to the climax is awesome that counts the most.the first 2 films were great i loved this despite the flaws bay is one director that improves each time he makes something new,i am still waiting for bad boys 3,but this third film almost killed the franchise and here is why.this film had new characters but what was done in the end ruined the whole impact specially the whole story that leads to the fight between Sentinel Prime & Optiums Prime with mega-tron getting in between them by getting provoked by Carly(Rosie Huntington Whiteley).the film was going great suspense action everything was there.but Michael bay should have told writers to make changes but not his fault actually and may i ask what just happens to the shock-wave he looses instantly.The Plot:after the events of fallen defeated by Optimus Prime SAM Witwicky just living a regular life again searching for job got a new girlfriend Carly as transformers are busy while mega-tron comes back with grand scheme to ruin the entire world.the cast is the same with few more guys added. Megan fox who i say was better then Rosie Huntington but got removed by the producers because of a controversy.the second half of the film is a serious mess Sentinel Prime & Megatron are worst villains ever in my list now the worst thing was Decepticons making a deal with the rich white dude who looks like Eric Bana.this is a nice film to see in transformers trilogy its a entertainer but the addition of mass action scenes seems pointless because of the bad climax.transformers:dark of the moon is not such a bad film its a great entertainer with addition of comedy also.but just a one time watch for a hardcore transformer fan.this film almost ruined the legacy set by the previous 2 films but i cant wait for age of extinction 2014 which i hope & wish will be a better film despite of Mark Wahlberg casted in it.My Rating Is 5/10 TDOTM 2011 is a one time good watch.",5,1,4,3 December 2013

","this films story is serious its a political drama film directed by Oliver Stone i don't like his films but have to say this one is the best.this film is about adventures of a Vietnam war veteran who looses his legs during a mission in war.i wont go into much detail of the story or other things but as a hardcore tom cruise fan i picked this up without any expectations & i was blown away its got action,drama & comedy all in one the best thing was the dialogues & funny situations like when tom cruise & willem dafoe at one point starts arguing & spitting & each other while sitting on wheelchairs on a deserted road is the most laugh out loud scene ever.tom cruise is the main highlight here he talks about how war affects people both in serious & comedy scenes.Born On The Fourth Of July 1989 is a must watch film for everyone for people who say tom cruise cant act i say just forget his mission impossible action films for once & see him in either cocktail,eyes wide shut & even collateral 2004 where he plays a assassin Or this one he can rally go into the character deep & bring out something amazing.my rating for this film is 10/10 Recommended",10,1,1,8 March 2017

Evil Dead II," The Most Weird Sequel Ever Made In Film History
","this is it guys this is the part where all that groovy catch phrase started by actor Bruce Campbell the evil dead came out in 1981 this is a sequel to it but it misses the mark and does not have the spark of the first film.evil dead 2 or dead by dawn 1987 is a half remake & half sequel it is one of the most weird sequel ever made in any franchise ever out there and also in film history at least i think so things don't make much sense here as the director Sam Raimi lost the rights to his original film or so whatever the controversy was this film should not have been made even army of darkness is better any then this.its got a lot of blood,gore but most things look Cartoonish & over the top the movie fails to take itself seriously it relies heavily on comedy then actual theme i mean eye balls can fly like superman wow.just what was the studio thinking and i don't blame Sam Raimi for this he is a master director he did his best he wrote the script himself but it would be a lot better if it followed the path of original & included some serious tone i felt Sam was restricted by the production company to keep it in a Pg rating hey i am just speculating it i saw this i felt maybe this is why the project feels awkward.i lost interest in the franchise after this as it was too goofy to handle but evil dead 3 army of darkness 1992 is better then this along with latest version of Evil Dead 2013 of Jane Levy.Overall Evil Dead 2:1987 feels like a parody of its own original so if you are expecting some scary stuff please don't just check this one out only if you like Sam Raimi my rating is 3/10.",3,1,3,10 April 2015
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," The Best Comedy Film Of Will Ferrel Ever Made Till Date
","Will Ferrell is one funny guy in Hollywood that no one can match after Jim Carey i believe hes made a lot of comedy films but this is totally the best of his career for me at least i saw this in 2006 or 2007 i guess now again i saw this recently its still one of the best comedy film ever made,yes it include a lot of racism,disrespecting other people,cultures and all sorts of nonsense that is going on in the world this film just tried to highlight this and its also a eye opener for one to see why these things are happening,apart from this the dialogs in this films are awesome lines like shake & bake,slingshot,you sound like a dog with a peanut butter in your mouth,if you ain't first you're last and many more,to talk about funny scenes it will take forever to discuss but one of my favorites are when Ricky Bobby feels he is on the fire and strips on the racing track,another one is the train scene where a guy insults him for talking about problems third one is where Ricky stabs himself with a knife,this movie is filled with hilarious stuff i wonder why there is not a sequel to this Will Ferrel Should make it,got nice racing scenes as well specially the ending crash sequence is well shot by director Adam Mckay.The Plot:Ricky Bobby Is A Nascar Driver He always wins at number one position with his friend until a man from France jean Girard challenges him Ricky;s life becomes a living nightmare after getting defeated by Girard,he looses his job,wife dumps him and hes got another rival hes got to watch out for his former best friend turned enemy Cal Naughton Jr.the cast:aside from Will Ferrel he looked awesome and got great comic timing he was very powerful here in the role,Sacha Baron Cochen was nice to see,John C Reilly as a great side hero, Lisle Bibb appears as a sexy hot lady but out of them all what was Amy Adams doing here i though she does got some humor in her it shows here.this film came in 2006 its got a theatrical version and an uncut version i saw the rated r version the first time i think i lost that one but this film does need a uncut version again with a lot of deleted scenes are more for fans to enjoy as i did,the theatrical edited version is a mess so beware of that and don't buy it only get unrated version.Over All Talladega Nights:The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby 2006 is a great film to watch its one of the most amazing comedy film ever made from the last decade i totally enjoyed it you will too just don't look at critic reviews please My Rating Is 10/10 Must See.Recommended",10,0,0,19 January 2014
Furious 7," Bond,Mission Impossible & Michael Bay All Mix Together Is Furious 7
","to sum it up in few words i must say this latest installment in the franchise is a mash up and mixture of James Bond 007,mission impossible series and pretty much all those films that Michael Bay directed we have seen over the years is equal to furious 7.why here are some of the reasons since 2001 the first installment came things changed in films if you go back and look at Rob Cohen's original you will find a balance later on directors changed and Justin Lin took over the franchise which was a good thing but the tone started to change it changed from the racing and heist element to the sake of action and new villains were introduced in each next chapter but they at least they tried there best at being stuck to some realism while this 7th film tried to included everything & ended up ruining itself.the cast:new members are added here Paul Walker passed away in 2013 in midway filming this was his last film but he looks great here doing action but his character cant do much here,Vin Diesel looked bored here seriously he should make the triple x sequel these films are enough now,the rock role is chopped off he gets beat up so bad and only appear in the climax blowing everything up he stole the whole drone & helicopter scene but the biggest highlights are Kurt Russell,Nathalie Emmanuel & finally my favorite Jason Statham he is so bad-ass here i thought i was watching a transporter sequel but sadly he is not used well he is not the main villain here,Elsa Patkay is here too but in a changed hairstyle but what i hated the most was role for Tony Jaa he gets wasted here this guy is a icon.The Plot:Deckard Shaw is after Dom and his family because they let his brother Owen Shaw left for dead just as Dom is about to deal with Shaw he gets in between a war with Somalian terrorists and government agents.for those who don't know Han died at end of Tokyo Drift 2006 and the events of fast and furious 2009,fast five 2011 & furious 6 2013 happened before that this begins right some time after Tokyo drift story Tokyo drift is my personal favorite film most underrated in franchise.let me be clear on one thing i did like the action here but at many times they were over the top critics will love it for sure but when same thing John Woo does it these hypocrites hate it i mean the Dubai building to building car stunt is insane it looks epic but hello guys not even Daniel Craig do this type of action as 007 the shaky camera wont bother as there is plenty of dialog and chemistry of actors with each other is enjoyable the scrip is to be blamed here seriously all these elements like technology and those comic book type stunts were not necessary if they had kept it little simple just like the first film in 2001 it would have been much better.the crowd was enjoying it no doubt but the guys need to be careful in future the edited needs to be tighter so the narrative wont go loose cannon the micro chip plot was not required at all Jason Statham's character is ignored here on purpose furious 7 tried hard to go back to the roots but what can anybody do these guys added too many stories in one film this is not avengers or batman please.this films is for adrenaline junkie fans only universal should remove James wan and bring some other director next time otherwise the fast and the furious series are done for.Overall Furious 7 2015 is a half good half bad film just don't expect a masterpiece that's all i have to say enjoy it for what it is my rating is 5/10:Recommended",5,98,210,3 April 2015
