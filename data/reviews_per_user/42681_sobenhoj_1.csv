The Ring," Scared the Hell out of me....but I loved every damn minute of it!
","I saw this movie as a sneak preview this week and I didn't know much about it at all. I thought, 'hey, the previews look kinda cool'... but I am very picky when it comes to suspense films, it takes alot to grab my interest and to scare me. This film litterally scared the hell out of me, one of the most intense films I have seen in a long time. The intense images compliment the shocking sound effects so well, leaving me completely jumpy throughout the film. I won't say anymore about this film because I don't want to ruin any of the thrills which I experienced from this film for any other viewer. If you don't have a weak heart go see this movie.",9,0,0,20 September 2002
