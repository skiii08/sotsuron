Moneyball," A fairytale based on true story.
","The story shows the hope how one can leverage own failure to overcome and make another dream come true. It's always wonderful to see the thing every other else says that's impossible become real. By that, we can keep hanging on the hope in the real life. Billy led and accomplished amazing and unbelieveable 20 consecutive wins of the team that no one had expected for. The story proves that if the passion is well designed and supported by sophisticated technic and efforts, impossible thing can be done in the real life.",8,2,3,23 September 2018
