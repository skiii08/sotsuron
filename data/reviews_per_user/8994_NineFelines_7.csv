Casablanca," Classic
","Seeing this movie for the first time, it is easy to understand why it is a much loved classic. The mise-en-scène is superb as is the acting and lighting and camera work. Even though, as with virtually all movies, the drama factor is a bit heightened by the compression of time (story vs. movie), it flows very well. The quality of the acting makes the characters are very believable and enduring. The way Bogart was lit during his close-ups to show the lines of his face, really conveyed his emotional state and Bergman always appeared to be on the verge of tears (no doubt thanks to a special lens or camera effect).While I knew the movie had been released before the end of World War 2, it didn't occur to me that actually meant the movie was in a position to predict the outcome (or to at least postulate a much hoped for conclusion). A prediction that, thankfully, was correct.",9,3,4,10 March 2012
Citizen Kane," Superb!
","A poignant and sad film that clearly demonstrate that Gregg Toland and Orson Welles were well matched in their ability to give dimension to a movie. I don't think I have ever seen a better depiction of massive size and scale of a room and how it could feel so claustrophobic at the same time. The lighting and photography deserve all the accolades they have been given over the decades, the makeup is fantastic and the acting is on par with the quality of the movie as a whole. Yes, some scenes are less than stellar (the pterodactyls in the swamp picnic for example), but this only emphasizes how good the remainder is (such as the scene where Mrs. Kane is signing away young Charles Foster Kane to the banker).The complexity of the time shifting plot is also impressive and well orchestrated to make it seem logical and seamless. I particularly like the way time was shown to progress through shots of each of his wives going about such mundane, daily tasks as eating breakfast and putting a jigsaw puzzle together - it described their lives as rather ordinary in an artistically subtle way that strengthened the effect for me.",9,0,1,10 March 2012
The Exorcist," Sensational, But Not (Too) Scary
","This movie is so iconic and has permeated our society to such a degree that I was convinced I had already seen it though, after watching it this time, I realize I actually hadn't. While I did not find this movie frightening, I do understand how it would have been found to be by viewers at the time. Its use of relatively cutting edge special effects (the head turning) mixed with the 'pea soup', make-up and voice over effects made little Regan appear quite the little demon. For me, though, it was the demon's explicit demands issued from Regan's previously innocent mouth that will be remembered.I was a bit confused as to why there was so much time spent showing Father Merrin in Iraq. Other than the scene with Father Merrin on the right of the screen facing the devil statue on the left of the screen (later repeated in pseudo flashback), I really didn't understand the significance.There were several interesting technical items in this movie. I especially like the scene when Father Damian Karras descended a spiral stair with the camera at the bottom looking up, tracking him circularly as he came down. There were also several dramatic uses of zoom in that added to the effect. The use of music was also memorable and added to the ambiance, especially (my favorite) 'Tubular Bells'.",8,0,1,30 April 2012
Annie Hall," Delightful Woody Allen Flick
","Woody Allen's use of interesting and unusual comic techniques is exemplified in this movie. The scene where he inserts his present self into a memory of himself as a child in elementary school then has a conversation with the past version of his classmates as they are in the present was fantastic if a bit complicated to describe in writing.Aside from the one possibly too long scene of Annie singing at the night club for the second time, 'Annie Hall' flows well and feels natural even though there are several occasions of the fourth wall being intentionally broken by Allen. The camera work, acting, and writing are all great and meld together well, though there was a scene or two I felt was so dark it was difficult to see the actors. I understand this is a signature of Gordon Willis, but I found it distracted from the story a bit as I was jarred out of the moment by not being able to see as well as I would have liked.",8,0,0,30 April 2012
The Graduate," Great Sixties Icon
","I am not able to grasp all of the significance attributed to this film by those who have personal experience regarding the 1960s, but I am able to recognize it as a very well crafted movie. The acting is great, particularly Dustin Hoffman's perfect portrayal of a dry, almost stiff, innocent and Anne Bancroft as the original über-cougar. The music is also spot-on and enveloping. I never listened to much Simon & Garfunkel, but I am now inclined to start. The cinematography is excellent and varied with perfect examples of masking & a match cut plus underwater scenes.While the story itself is not that unusual today, it has a different quality to others I have seen from that period in time. Even though it is obviously dramatized, it seems more 'real' than previous movies. The situations are more frank than what would have been depicted in movies made only a few years prior and I can easily see why that, at the very least, resonates with the spirit of freedom exhibited in the 1960s.",8,3,4,17 April 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Wow.
","Being somewhat ambivalent about musicals and having a general tendency not to watch movies which debuted before I was born, I had no real knowledge of this movie other than its existence. I also was only peripherally familiar with Technicolor and wasn't aware it was really any different than any other color film technology. Now that I have seen both, it is easy to understand why this movie is so famous.Yes, to those of us who are less able to appreciate the intricacies of some of the extended dance scenes, they can seem too long, but this is a small criticism which is easily washed away by the deluge of all the other excellent qualities the movie possesses. The acting is, of course, superb, but I think I was struck most by how humorous and clever the writing is. The music and singing are also exceptional. Every time someone says 'Good morning!', I am reminded of Debbie Reynolds' particular way of singing the words. The vibrancy of the color saturation due to the Technicolor process lends the movie an almost dream-like quality that fits so well, I cannot imagine it any other way. The camera work is so fluid it sometimes seems the actors are dancing with, not just for the camera. The costumes and sets are great and done is such a way that the movie has aged well; it doesn't seem to be a movie made over 60 years ago.",9,0,2,2 April 2012
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Unfortunate Insanity
","I found this movie difficult to watch, not because of the subject matter, but because it initially seemed as unsure of its destination as I was. It is entirely understandable that a movie about a mental institution would provide an insight into the daily routine of the inhabitants which is most likely quite dull and, well, routine. It is also necessary to provide for character development, but too much monotony and introduction is just difficult to watch. This is not to say that any of the actors were negligent in their craft. Everyone was very believable in their respective roles, so much so that it took me a while to recognize Danny DeVito. Jack Nicholson was his usually boisterous and slightly insane self and Louise Fletcher was a superb Nurse Ratched. The technical aspects of the movie were sufficient and fluid, but did not draw attention to themselves with any particularly notable exhibition of flair.The second half did pick up a bit and the ending misses making the movie more than just worth watching by only a tiny fraction. I suppose I just can't help but feel a bit unsure about whether or not anyone actually escaped and whether or not that is the movie's intent on how I should feel.",6,1,3,30 April 2012
