The Blair Witch Project," What exactly is the big deal?????
","Jeez, What exactly is the big deal here??  90 minutes of shaky, amateur camera work without a coherent plotline, terminally stricken by incompetent acting which simply highlights the lack of a decent script--at the very least some dramatic improvisation or clever ad-libbing might have raised this stinker to the level of high camp.  I have more admiration for the amazing hype which put the film in the black than any other aspect of 'Blair Witch'! OK, guys, A+ in marketing but you flunk the freshman film course--next time don't wait until the night before the project is due.",Null,0,1,21 August 1999
