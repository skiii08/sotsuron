Requiem for a Dream," Riveting.... horrifying... great
","This film is the most unpleasant film I've ever seen. I mean that as a compliment. It is the most gripping, intense film that I've ever seen. As a former psychedelic user, (LSD and psilocybin, or magic mushrooms) I've had a number of 'Bad trips' and the mother character's experience in this is the closest I've ever seen to drug-induced psychosis... Aranovski is great in this. This is the movie that made me decide he was the reincarnation of Kubrick, not literally, but it has the same cerebral feel, and I loved this movie.Wow I need more lines? I guess I'd just say that you should certainly see this movie.. it was among my favorite of the decade, and wouldn't advise letting your children watch this movie.. it's certainly an adult and disturbing movie.. in fact, I wouldn't advise that religious or otherwise easily offended audiences watch this... it's dirty, gritty, and real.",Null,0,1,16 September 2011
