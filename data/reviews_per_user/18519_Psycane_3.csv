Black Swan," Filmmaking at its FINEST!
","To quickly encapsulate the plot before I forget, Black Swan tells the story of a dancer, Nina, whose strive to lose herself in her role as both The Swan Queen and, more so, The Black Swan, causes her to truly lose who she is, and her mind, in her obsession over the role. If a film is able to immerse you in from start to finish, that is excellent. If it is a horror film, or even a psychological thriller like this, especially a more recent one, that is truly special. Enwrapping myself in a horror film, or any film for that matter, is an amazing experience, because I can feel like I am experiencing what is actually happening. This makes it all the more scary and effecting. The other films that I was able to do this with, in the horror genre, are Rosemary's Baby (1968), that being my favorite horror film, Alien, The Sixth Sense, Halloween (1978) yes I really did, and more recently, The Babadook. And of course now, this. I wasn't expecting to fall in love with this film like I did, I had heard incredible things about it, had been very excited for it and last night, I was finally able to watch it, even if I had only rented it in ITunes. I was truly astonished at just how good it was. Darren Aronofsky direction was nearly pitch perfect, he really did a great job and seemed very passionate with this project. A film like this, should be well written, lest it make sense in the end. And as you think about it after the credits roll, Nina's (Natalie Portman) crazy psyche episode does. That is a HUGE compliment to this film's writing.Portman's role as Nina was perfectly cast and incredibly performed, not surprising seeing her Best Actress win for the role. As was everyone else greatly cast, Mila Kunis did a great job of being pretty much the polar opposite of Portman's character as Lily. This movie also certainly looks fantastic, I loved the cinematography and how almost every shot felt like an artistic capture.For the psychological thriller aspect, it was amazingly done and very intense. I felt like I was holding my breath for quite a bit of the film and the deteriorating psyche of our main character, as mentioned before, is to some absurd and confusing, to me, real, effecting, emotional and beautiful.This is overall an honest masterpiece of a film that I am so glad that I finally got to see it. I very much recommend it. It is an incredible and amazing experience that I wanna have again and want you all to have. Unless you are younger cause it will be hard for you to follow and it is also disturbing and there are a couple pretty inappropriate scenes. But it is an amazing experience and is rising the ranks of my favorites (my 19th currently). Wow this film. Black Swan is incredible. Please go see it now!",9,0,2,10 August 2015
The Maze Runner," Don't bother unless you are a teen/pre-teen
","Though entertaining, this film lost a lot of potential. The film's universe is not explained well as the film draws to a close and that conclusion was bad. The film had some good actors, but sub- par others. The characters were not very well written as was some of the dialog. This movie tries its best to stay close to the source material but ultimately fails. What the film was trying to say and its views have been done before. This was a fairly entertaining movie, though it just falls flat and with unnecessary and some poorly executed sequences, this film could have been a lot better. But it just squanders any originality and takes a possibly fantastic idea and series into just another YA film adaption and series. Not worth your time, though I do suggest reading the excellent novel and its sequels by James Dashner.",4,0,0,22 September 2015
Midnight in Paris," Incredible
","This is easily one of my favorites! I love this movie to death, it's funny, insightful, passionate, meaningful, romantic. The directing is glorious, considering how flashy and dumb it could have been, Woody Allen makes this story seem so real and it comes so naturally. The cinematography is jaw dropping and the score is absolutely wonderful. You can just tell how much everyone working on this project was passionate about it and wanted to make it the best it could be. All the performances were astounding, and ensemble cast with not one standing out as an actor during the experience and easily Owen Wilson's best performance in my opinion. This film is so different and original and it plays it off so normal. There is a reason the film won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The dialogue was excellent, feeling very real and as if characters were actually just people talking. The film inspires me as an artist, it really tries to be art and about art. But more than that: it is about love, understanding, dreams, our past and so much more! This film is so quirky but so beautiful at the same time. It is something that I would suggest anyone watch because my god is this film amazing!",9,5,7,1 October 2015
