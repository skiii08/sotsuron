The Blair Witch Project," A chilling, original, clever piece of film-making
","The Blair Witch Project is a film that was slaughtered by hype and propaganda. When the previews came out it, the film was described as being the scariest movie ever made and it was compared to films such as The Exorcist. As a result, people went to see the movie expecting to be frightened out of their mind. In a lot of cases, the film had trouble living up to these expectations. I feel this film has been treated incredibly unfairly by the public because it is a very scary movie. You find a lot of people didn't like it because you never actually see the witch. Other people say there wasn't enough violence. I think this movie is very tastefully made and uses the art of subtlety to scare its audience. The scariest thing about the film is its intense realism and credibility. It seems so realistic. You can imagine it happening to you. If you haven't seen this movie, then go and see it for yourself. The acting is brilliant and the atmosphere is chilling. Don't compare it to any other movie until you see it. It brilliant. 5 stars",10,2,3,3 May 2000
From Dusk Till Dawn," A very slick, stylish, funny film.
","Dusk Till Dawn is a cinematic masterpiece. It combines horror and black comedy with supreme experience. Rodriguez's direction is perfect and all the performances are terrific. All the roles are perfectly casted and add to the incredible atmosphere of the film. The film is clever because its two different types of films combined. A chase\cops & robbers film and a horror film. In the first half, you begin to like the characters and then, when the plot twist hits you like a sledgehammer, you are worried about the characters and you go through the same horror they are going through. All in all, From Dusk Till Dawn is a very classy film, with great makeup and a blistering soundtrack. Don't miss this movie if you are a fan of action\horror\comedy films. 5 stars",10,0,1,29 April 2000
Pulp Fiction," A flawless film
","This is a cinematic masterpiece. It is nothing short of brilliant and an incredible contribution to international cinema. It contains, arguably the funniest and wittiest dialogue ever in a film. Everybody in the world should see this movie. No matter what age. 5 stars",10,1,2,29 April 2000
Titanic," A long, monotonous, piece of epic trash
","Titanic is an over-hyped, over-rated piece of garbage. It goes an hour too long and winds on for what seems like decades. The plot is a poorly written, romantic piece of rubbish and the performances by DeCaprio and Winslet are mediocre. However, Billy Zane and Kathy Bates bring some some hope to the non-existent story line. Putting the plot and acting aside, Titanic is a technical milestone. The sequences where the Titanic sinks are nothing short of mind-blowing and you would think you are on the ship. It is lucky that the sinking of the ship is so brilliant, because after the length of time the viewer has to wait, it is much deserved. All in all, this is a movie that should have sunk in an hour and a half.",7,8,13,29 April 2000
Moon," Tense, atmospheric film-making.
","Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) works for a company called Lunar Industries, which is harvesting an energy source, called Helium-3, from the surface of the moon. He operates the mining station on his own, with only an intelligent robot named Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) to keep him company and tend to his daily needs. Sam's contract is for three years and he's only two weeks away from returning home to his wife and young daughter. When Sam accidentally crashes one of the station's all-terrain vehicles, he wakes up in the station's infirmary. Gerty's evasive answers to his questions about the accident lead him to investigate further - and he makes a disturbing discovery. Directed by the son of David Bowie, Duncan Jones, this claustrophobic, slow-burning thriller builds in tension as secrets are revealed. At its core is a rather simple idea, and it's executed with finesse. The mining station's isolation becomes increasingly heavy and is the perfect backdrop for the intriguing drama that ensues. Sam Rockwell, as always, is brilliant to watch and Kevin Spacey's polite, genial Gerty is unsettling. Jones' minimalistic approach is crucial and perfectly delivered, allowing the gripping mystery to unravel. The sets feel intensely real and special effects are used seamlessly and sparingly. Moon has the palpable qualities of a film from the 70s and is filled the visceral nuances. Moon is ultimately a chilling film that maintains its vision until the final credits. It asks some important questions about our future and an impending desperation for natural resources. It's a very impressive feature debut from Jones. The DVD release has a comprehensive set of special features. There are three audio commentaries, a short film by Jones called Whistle, making-of and special effects featurettes, and footage of live Q&A sessions. All in all, a release worth owning.",9,1,4,14 February 2010
