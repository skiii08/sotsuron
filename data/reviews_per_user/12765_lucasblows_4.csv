Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pathetic
","The Phantom Menace is absolutely horrible.  Bad writing, bad directing, bad editing, bad acting, etc.  Perhaps the worst movie of 1999.  Don't be fooled into thinking that Jar Jar was the only problem with this film. There are far too many things bad to list here.If you like to have your intelligence insulted time and time again with ridiculous plot elements and just plain stupidity, then this is the movie for you.If you watch movies to see swirling pretty colors rather than a good story, then this is the movie for you.If you like to reward shameless marketing and poorly rehashed plot outlines, then this is the movie for you.I simply have one question for Mr. Lucas:Why, George?  For the love of God, why??!!",1,2,4,16 June 2000
The Thing," Sci-Fi Horror at it's best
","This is an absolutely great movie, definitely Kurt Russell's best ever.John Carpenter's 'The Thing' holds my top spot among Sci-Fi horror films (in a tie with the original Alien).  I can think of no other in that genre that comes close to those two.  I have watched it over and over again and pick up new little subtleties each time.  If you have not seen it, check it out ASAP.  I wish they still made films like this rather than the crap Hollywood puts out today.",10,1,2,6 January 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," One of the worst movies I've ever seen
","I was excited when I saw the previews for 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'.  It was expressly marketed as the first movie to tell the story the way Bram Stoker wrote it.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Calling it 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is an insult to the author of this classic tale.  It's not just that it doesn't compare to the book.  That rarely happens with any screen adaptation of a great novel.  However, Coppola completely changed massive amounts of important aspects of the story.  I find it amusing that after going on and on about how it was going to adhere so strictly to the original story, they had to release a new novel of Coppola's version so people would 'get it'.Most of the acting is terrible throughout.  The nature of characters are completely different from Stoker's (most notably Van Helsing, Mina, and Lucy).  The love story added in is lame (at one point reminiscent of a Monty Python skit), and some of the 'imagery' is cheesy.  There were some decent effects, though, which made about 1% of the movie interesting.  Some of the costumes aren't bad, others aren't good.After seeing an interview with Coppola, one really gets the sense that he believes this is the way the story 'should have' or 'would have' been told had Stoker been allowed to write openly about certain topics.  That is, however, utter nonsense and arrogance.Coppola has made some astounding films, but this ain't one of them.  It's amongst the worst movies I've ever seen.",1,60,114,5 May 2001
Jurassic Park," Spielberg Ruins a Great Story
","Could have been great.  Should have been great.  Would have been great. Wasn't great.  Spielberg ruins another movie with his predictable, politically-correct, 'warm and fuzzy' style.  Read the book, but don't see the movie unless you are only interested in great effects, which are certainly abundant in the film.  In addition to (and more likely *due* to) Spielberg's bad direction, weak performances abound.  The best thing I can think of to say about it is that it is not as bad as the sequel.",3,9,29,6 January 2001
