Skyfall," Very Disappointing .....
","After all the hype surrounding this movie and this being the best Bond ever, it turned out to be a very big disappointment. I guess it starts with him being shot and falling to what should have been a death fall considering the height. He then inexplicably turns up on a beach in bed with a beautiful woman. That part was annoying. I thought maybe the film had gone back in time and going to lead up to what happened in the opening chase scene. But this wasn't the case.Next, he befriends an absolute stunningly beautiful woman (Berenice Marlohe) in Macau. He finds out she was abused as a child sex slave and Bond says he can protect her. At this point, you really want to see some justice for her. But then, Bond jumps naked into the shower with her and she gets killed in cold blood soon after. Yes, we all know Bond is a womanizer who uses woman to defend Queen and Country. But this particular conquest was in line with that of a sexual predator. I'll jump to the end where you learn Skyfall was just the name of Bond's childhood home. The setting is a dark and grim landscape and that's OK because you're anticipating a huge climax to the movie. For whatever reason, Bond has chosen to bring M to an isolated area with no backup knowing full well the bad guys are coming. And instead of a climax, you find out Bond has come to the fight ill prepared with little fire power. So, he rigs the place with MacGyver- like booby traps. In the end, Bond of course wins but the franchise as a whole loses a step.",1,4,10,2 September 2013
