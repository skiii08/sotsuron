Ford v Ferrari," Not A Big Fan of Cars and Racing.
","I'm not a big fan of cars and racing, but still there was not a single moment in the movie that bored me. It was an absolute terrific cinematic experience, all thanks to Bale and Matt Damon. Christian Bale was the highlight of the movie, absolute monster of an actor.",8,2,3,5 December 2019
