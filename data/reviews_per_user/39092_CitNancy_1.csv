The Blair Witch Project," I've never really hated a movie but...
","The blair witch project in my opinion is the most over hyped, over estimated movie of the year!And its not even a movie! It's more like a student film. Picture the worst movie of all time multiply it by ten and you wont even get close to how vile this is! This is the movie that would get shown in my own version of heck.First of all the hype killed it - that and the spoofs - by the time you see it most of the footage has already been seen in commercials and entertainment shows.And the 'actors' and 'actress'. Sure it made them famous but where will they be next summer? I wish they really got lost in the woods, then we would have never had to see them!Finally, this is a perfect movie for MST3k (may it rest in peace), more perfect if they watched it with the sound off.",1,2,4,18 December 1999
