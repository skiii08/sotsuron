Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Unbelievably terrible!
","This movie is what happens when special effects take precedence over the story. The plot was ridiculous, the script awful, and the dialogue laughable. A cast of broomsticks could have delivered a less wooden performance than was delivered by the cast of the Phantom Menace (Maybe we'll put this down to an atrociously bad director as Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, at least, *can* act -- but they showed no sign of it in this film.)A total waste of 4.50 and 2-3 hours of my life.",1,56,106,11 July 2000
