The Blair Witch Project," I paid $7.50 for THIS?????
","When I first heard about this movie, I was excited. It looked like it was going to be a really scary horror movie. My sister told me that she couldn't sleep for something like two days after seeing this movie.That made me want to see it all the more.After seeing this I came to this conclusion: This movie both sucks ass AND bites the big one at the same time! I was truly scared when I looked at my ticket stub. I will never get that 86 minutes of my life back.They should have shot blanks at us during the movie. At least then, I'd actually be scared. This movie's only redeeming value is that it was done creatively. Other then that, the DVD would make a nice coaster or ornament.",1,3,6,4 February 2006
Blade," Wonderfully Done
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. When I saw it for the first time I almost cried because it was incredibly close to the comic. Not since Batman (1989) has a movie been so close to the comic, and it was a breath of fresh air. The action is fantastic and the script was written very well, I guess so since David Goyer writes comic books! I highly recommend this movie for everybody who is a comic fan. Hardcore vampire fans might not like it but so what. Wesley Snipes was perfect in his role as Blade, and he pulled off being a bad ass really well. What would have made this movie better is if Wesley Snipes did his own stunts. I don't understand being a 5th degree black belt, but not doing your own stunts. Big Baby.",8,0,2,10 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The best so far!!!
","I love this movie, I give it a 5 of 5.  Before I begin my review, let me explain MY rating system: 1)Not worth seeing for free, 2)Worth seeing for free, 3)Worth paying to see, 4)Worth paying to see, again and 5)Worth the purchase. Now on to my review:  George Lucas has done it again!  This is his crowning achievement so far, and it's only gonna get better!  I know a lot of people didn't like the acting or the dialogue, but to the fans this was beyond a masterpiece.  This movie far surpasses everything in the previous trilogy with sound and visuals.  Granted, George Lucas sticks to a certain formula, but if the shoe fits... I feel that the acting in the movie was not as bad as most have said, and the dialogue is standard Star Wars.  There is no way around it.  George Lucas has his method of doing things and he's not gonna change.  For every Star Wars fan that thought this movie was bad look at it this way: My wife is ABSOLUTELY NOT a Star Wars fan, but she liked this one! If a non-fan can like it, why can't everyone who claims to be loyal?  I say respect Lucas for his vision and his dreams, because if it was not for Star Wars 90% of the movies today could not have been made.",10,1,2,22 October 2003
Transformers," I'm at a loss for words...
","I literally just got done seeing this. You can call me a fan boy if you want and you're probably right. While well done, this movie was NOT as bad ass as I was told it was. Sure, there were good action scenes and some funny moments as well but it just didn't seem complete to me for some odd reason.First of all, whenever Megan Fox was on screen, I was distracted by her. Can she be any hotter? Second, Hugo Weaving is NOT Megatron. He was adequate for what he needed to do, but it's just not the same.Third, I have a lot of unanswered questions. I understand 'suspension of disbelief' but how can a human sized robot walk right past a large crowd of people (with people FACING him) and not get caught? I'm really not trying to bash this, I just wasn't very impressed. There was, however, some good to it.The voice acting wasn't too bad, the action scenes were done very well and I'm glad there were little things that honored the cartoon series.Fans may enjoy this, fan boys may not. I'm not making a recommendation or a non-recommendation. I can only tell you to judge for yourself.",5,2,7,26 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not the best, but very good
","First, let me say that I LOVE Star Wars. I first saw A New Hope when I was three years old, and it changed my life. When I heard that the prequels were coming out, I was ecstatic. Now that the movies have come full circle. I can honestly say that I am well pleased with the series. As I said in the title, this movie is not the best by a long shot, but it's still really good. I personally think Episode II: Attack Of The Clones was the best, and this is a close second for the prequels. George Lucas can pull something from American Beauty (film a plastic bag floating on the wind) and I'll watch it. I will be a George Lucas fan to the end.This movie had a lot of hype coming with it. While the hype was good, I believe that it harmed this movie a little. Now I've gone to all of the spoiler sites and knew everything that was going to happen, but the anticipation of what may have been took away from what actually was. Most people that I talk to who have seen this movie say that it was good, but the dialogue sucked. I challenge anyone to show me one 'Star Wars' movie that has an Oscar worthy script. You'll never find it. Star Wars is, in the exact words of George Lucas, 'the most expensive low-budget movie ever made.' Every low budget movie generally has cheesy dialogue. With Star Wars, the dialogue is not as important as the story. This movie tied everything together. It finished the plot. The dialogue can be as cheesy as it wants. This is a 'B' movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm not putting Star Wars down at all, I'm just putting it in the appropriate genre: Science FANTASY. Get over the cheesy dialogue and get into the story.",10,2,7,18 June 2005
Sin City," Pure Perfection!
","Before I begin, let me explain my rating system: 1 - Not worth seeing for free, 2 - Worth seeing for free, 3 - Worth paying to see, 4 - Worth paying to see again, 5 - Worth buying. When I first saw this movie, I was not prepared for it. I have never read a Sin City comic, but I knew all about Frank Miller. While I was watching this, there were some parts that were almost shocking (for me) and I thought 'this is really dark. No, this is Frank Miller.' I had no idea that Sin City was like that. I have to buy the graphic novels now. This movie was FANTASTIC. A comic book movie could not have been done better. I applaud Robert Rodriguez for his efforts, and for standing his ground with the DGA (he got kicked out...again!) I give this movie a 5/5.",10,0,2,18 June 2005
