Us," Nop this is not good
","I thought this will be more terrifying
But it was not like that
When you do a terror movie it's supposed to be scary for the audience
This movie wasn't scary at all
It has not horror or terror
This is more like a comedy
I don't why people think that Jordan is an amazing director
He is not that good
He should've stayed on Jordan and Peele
The only good about this movie is Lupita Nyong'o",7,1,1,20 April 2019

Bohemian Rhapsody," Is it good?
","Rami Malek his performance is the best

After more than 40 years it's a freaking amazing movie of terror

Avengers: Infinity War," Ten years
","I as a fan I would give it a 10
But as a critic I give it a 9
It has the emotional effect after all this years of the MCU
Story is perfect. The antagonist is perfect.
Finally we have an end
But just the half of it
Cause we have to wait for the second part in 2019",7,0,3,8 January 2019
A Quiet Place," Sucks
","It has great actors but it wasn't good for me
The story is weak
The enemy weak and idiot
The final is the worst
I wouldn't watched it again",6,1,2,8 January 2019
Midsommar," This is masterpiece
","This movie wants to disturb you
Ari Aster doesn't give two f*** about you
He wants to show you his vision
This is not a movie for sensitive people
Although is not a hundred percent a horror movie, this can hit you pretty good
This movie has gore and highly tension sequences
The symbolism is on another level and also the end
This is more a thriller and mystery movie than horror
But Ari Aster is still great
You definitely should watch it, if you're brave enough",8,9,15,3 July 2019
