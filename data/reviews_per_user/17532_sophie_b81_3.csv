Hereditary," Deeply disturbing; not for the impatient
","HEREDITARY, as demonstrated by mixed reviews, is not for all audiences. However, I found it to be one of the most deeply disturbing and unique horror movies I've ever seen. Few times has a movie left me feeling so unsettled and thinking about it days after viewing.I think what people don't like about the movie are the following choices made for the film: slow pacing, complicated mythology woven in between 'normal' scenes, and a staggered layering of the film that devotes 70% family drama, 20% tragedy and terror, and 10% mythological horror. Also, some say it's 'artsy,' which is true. But it's so much more than that. I really can't understand how some users claimed they laughed during HEREDITARY. Sure, there are some nonsense scenes near the end that are hard to interpret as anything other than bizzare. However, you have to be very desensitized or unsympathetic not to be disturbed by some of the tragic and terrifying moments the family in the film goes through. Just skip this movie if you don't have the patience for emotional drama, metephors, or self-interpretation. If you have an appreciation for unsettling horror that takes root slowly rather than through frequent jumpscares, watch HEREDITARY. If you're looking for a horror movie that goes outside the norm of the genre and flays it from the inside, watch HEREDITARY. If you sympathize with mental illness and the devastating impacts it may have on families, watch HEREDITARY.Side note: the acting is incredible. I will never forget Toni Collete's performance as Annie. She deserves so much praise.",9,1,3,17 October 2018
A Quiet Place," Will stop your heart
","A QUIET PLACE is a silent scream for help: all of the characters, besides being plagued by earth-dwelling aliens, face hardships unique to their roles in the family. The oldest sister blames herself for a family tragedy. The mother guilts herself for bringing a new life into their chaotic world. The father feels that he is an inadequate provider. Tie all of these emotions, family relationships, and personal struggles into an apocalyptic world where no one can vocalize their fears and feelings without being targeted by monsters and you have one hell of a movie! This movie defies genres and will appeal to a wide, albeit patient (the tension builds slowly between scenes), audience. Bravo to John Krasinski who demonstrates major acting and directing chops in his debut film.",8,0,0,14 August 2018
Black Panther," One of the best Marvel movies yet
","As I scroll through mixed reviews, I cannot see what people didn't enjoy about BLACK PANTHER. Every character was uniquely memorable, which is more than can be said for a lot superhero movies. They are all fantastic additions to the Marvel movie universe. Marvel triumphs with BLACK PANTHER, which beautifully blends elements from African and African-American culture into all the ingredients that make an amazing action film: a noble hero who has as much to prove to himself as others, a villian who is as charismatic as he is evil, and an alluring, magical setting complete with out-of-this-world technology. Plus, the movie has an awesome soundtrack and score, both of which I now listen to on my own time. I believed bad reviews to be accurate, until I actually went to see the movie and judge it for myself. I sat in the theater, completely engaged, waiting for the movie to get bad. However, it never did, and it kept me hooked til the last scene. I will watch it a thousand more times and still have my eyes glued to the screen.",10,0,3,14 August 2018
