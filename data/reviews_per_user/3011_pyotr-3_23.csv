The Lobster," A complete waste of time
","I thought I would enjoy this film since I enjoy a good quirky comedy that makes a statement on society. But I only enjoyed the first half of the film.The first half was quirky and clever, at least somewhat. But the second half was very difficult to sit through. It felt sadistic, cruel and even sick. I had to divert my eyes a few times. The humor was completely gone. And it seemed to me that there was no point to the movie at all. In short, it was a waste of two hours. And while nobody can agree on what happened at the end of the movie, it was sickening and horrifying to watch. No humor & no point.Colin Farrell did a good job acting and it was fun seeing him heavier, not a hunk. But unless you enjoy pointless acts of cruelty, you should avoid this one.",1,12,18,29 May 2016
Fight Club," Nice message, but ending seemed a bit absurd
","The first half of 'Fight Club' was quite good, with an excellent message, but the surprise turn of events in the end seemed pretty absurd to me.  I found the ending very disappointing, but still left thinking about the film's original message.  I just regretted that it didn't carry out the message as well as I thought it could be.",Null,0,1,15 October 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," sadly demeaning to gay people
","The film made me feel like the filmmakers consider gay people to have been put on earth purely for them to make fun of, and I found it depressing to watch.  It could have been a hilarious film for me, but how can you enjoy a film in which you are constantly ridiculed?  Supposedly ALL groups are ridiculed in the film: not true.  Only gays are mercilessly and consistently ridiculed.  The film was ruined for me by this flippant disregard for the value of me as a human being.",1,1,22,1 January 2000
The Danish Girl," A surprisingly beautiful and heart-warming true story
","As with all true stories, this film is fictionalized but it is based on real events of a century ago. The story of one of the first people to ever attempt to change genders, it is a reminder of how far we have come in understanding those who feel they were born the wrong gender.Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander both deserve Oscars for the heart-rending, real performances they give here. I felt like I was in their real home with them, coming to grips with situations with them. I already knew Redmayne was an extraordinary actor, but I did not know Vikander. She has a quality much like Jennifer Lawrence which makes you just fall in love with her as she lovingly grapples with her husband's dilemma, realizing that she must support him.The story is presented in such a beautiful manner, it is a joy to watch. That was surprising. Perhaps it is the sign of a superbly-made movie. Everything about this movie is top-notch, and the entire supporting cast is remarkable. I had no idea I would love this movie as much as I do.",10,3,11,27 December 2015
Billy Elliot," The word 'magnificent' hardly does it justice
","I walked out of this film feeling like a million dollars.  It makes you feel so good, so hopeful, and so full of goodwill... It is better than a hundred anti-depression pills.You could say that the story is predictable, but it is so much more than that.  It is NOT predictable how you will FEEL as you see Billy go through the hardships which he and his family encounter.  The performances are stunning - especially the young man who plays Billy - but also the wonderful Julie Walters, whom you may recall from her electric performance in 'Educating Rita.'There is no one on earth who could watch this film and not leave feeling like he/she is walking on clouds.  Do yourself a favor and see 'Billy Elliot.'  It is great medicine.",10,0,0,12 November 2000
Alexander," Stunning, magnificent movie - and it is stunning the world
","I congratulate Oliver Stone on being the first director to create a major motion picture about a historical figure who happens to have been gay in a relatively accurate manner. Bravo, Oliver! 'Alexander' is a huge film, about a huge person from an era that most people have almost no understanding of. It had to be a very difficult film to make, since there was so much to tell. Credit must be given for tackling such a formidable task. I found 'Alexander' to be moving and magnificent. The acting, the battle scenes, the storyline all fell into place to me. I am puzzled as to why so many bad reviews of this film have appeared in mainstream American publications, but after considering AUDIENCE reaction I think I know why: Most straight people seem to have been stunned by this film. I heard snickering and giggles during the most serious, somber and beautiful scenes between Alexander and Hephaestion. It was quite pathetic, actually. It showed ho incapable most straight people STILL are of accepting the fact that those of us who are gay also experience love - just as they do. I will never understand why so many people can not grasp this simple notion, but I assume it is simply the result of having never SEEN it, since even the show 'Will & Grace' never shows any of the gay characters in an actual relationship, in love, or in bed with a lover. The straight character, Grace, is in bed with countless men and no one blinks an eye, yet the networks refuse even a kiss to Will. So it should be no surprise that Americans remain homophobic and rather clueless about this harmless aspect of the life of all gay persons: love. I think the movie 'Alexander' is revolutionary inasmuch as it allows people the first view of a gay hero which does not TOTALLY hide the truth of who he truly loved. It will stimulate debate, and some learning will take place as a result. Alexander built libraries and improved conditions for people in many places that he conquered... he was hailed as a liberator in some places... he revolutionized the treatment of women to some extent and he made shaving one's beard popular for the first time. Many things about Alexander were left out of the movie, and I hope that Stone's film ill encourage people to go read about him now. The book to read is Robin Lane Fox's 'Alexander the Great.' This is the best book written for a thorough overview of his life. Many others written are rather uninteresting - and it is a shame when history is made boring. When you tell the truth in history, it suddenly pops to life, and Fox's book does just that. All scholars recognize it as the best source of info.",10,7,17,26 November 2004
The Mummy," OK for adolescents but a bore for adults
","The story, premise and special effects of this movie will be silly and rather boring to any adult, I believe.  However, adolescents and teens would probably enjoy it.  Brendan Fraser is one of my favorite actors, but he is wasted here. I could barely manage to watch it to the end.  It is made as more of a cartoon than as an action adventure story.",3,0,1,11 October 1999
Troy," Worse than awful
","One of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I laughed through much of it.  The sight of Brad Pitt sword-fighting like he's in a Kung Fu movie made me howl with every pose.  Since when is ancient Greek sword fighting akin to East Asian martial arts?The 9 or 10 year Trojan War is condensed to about 2 weeks.  And Achilles, who had a male lover in Homer's epic about the Trojan War, is made safely hetero for the homophobic audiences of our modern age. Achilles (in the real story) refused to fight at one point, and was only convinced to return to the battle when his lover, Patroclus, was killed by Hector.  In the movie none of these key facts even exist.  The story is totally re-written.There's way too much graphic violence.  Way too little story.  And way too many errors in what little story there is.  Forget this one.  Wait to see if Oliver Stone does a better job with his epic on Alexander the Great and ignore this Hollywood farce.",1,5,13,17 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Must be seen twice
","Possibly the greatest film I have ever seen. Period.I didn't think it possible that anyone could beat Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote this year, but by golly Heath Ledger DID it. His portrayal of ranch hand Ennis Del Mar is the most real thing I have ever seen. I will go even further: every actor who performs for even a second in this film is absolute perfection. It could not have been better acted or put together.Ang Lee has proved that he is a genius with this film. If he does not win the Oscar for Best Director, I will know that something is rotten in Denmark. His work here was simply unbeatable. Unsurpassable.I recommend reading the story as well as seeing the movie, and I recommend seeing the movie at least twice. Ang Lee has packed every moment with so much, that I do think it is essential to see it more than once to FULLY appreciate all that this film has to offer.Many men have written to author Annie Proulx to tell her 'You have told my story.' It is a true-life western story that is way past due being told. It is the real life story of many ranch hands, cowboys, and farmers, and it is a shame that the world is only now seeing and hearing their story. I have never been a cowboy, yet it mirrored my own life to an amazing degree nonetheless. I could relate 100% with every single frame... at times I did feel as though my own story was being told, even though my story took place in the southeast rather than the West.See this film. It will be a historical landmark film for the ages.",10,14,19,17 December 2005
Milk," Great man, Great film, Great performance by Sean Penn
","'Milk' is the best film of 2008, hands down. Anyone unfamiliar with the story of Harvey Milk and his murder needs to know it. Those of us who have already read a ton of books and articles about Harvey Milk, and seen the award-winning documentary 'The Times of Harvey Milk' will find a side of Harvey we had not seen before in this movie so the film really is a must-see whoever you are.The performances by the entire cast are perfection... a notch better than even the best of films. I believe this is due to the story of Harvey Milk, who inspired so many of us and changed the lives of millions of us for the better. Harvey himself surely inspired these great performances. Once you have seen Harvey's smile, and heard Harvey's words, and seen Harvey in action (as we all can do by watching 'The Times of Harvey Milk' documentary) you can never see the world the same way again.Sean Penn's performance as Harvey could not be bettered by any actor living today, so we owe him a great debt for making this movie, and giving his heart and soul to the role. I believe it is Penn's most mature yet also most lovable role ever. I wanted the movie to go on and on, because I felt like I was actually there in San Francisco in 1978-79. Gus Van Sant recreated that world perfectly, and Sean Penn showed us the potential of this very real man with this unique ability to inspire and transform us. Gus and Sean have each earned a very special chamber in Heaven for giving us this beautiful tribute.",10,79,127,28 November 2008
Snatch," Clever enough, but has flaws
","'Snatch' is a well-crafted film with some good performances, and it will keep you entertained, but it has some flaws that will prevent me from ever bothering to watch it again...1. The silly names of the characters are a bit much.  2. The anti-gay comments of one of the thugs are not necessary and spoil the fun of the film for me.  Would they include racist comments of a comparable nature? Heck no.  It really ticks me off that filmmakers think it's still fine to dehumanize gays.3. Brad Pitt isn't used enough.  He's the only character who lights up the screen in this film.  It's a straight boy film, and the straight boys in the audience I saw it with all cheered at the end (for some reason), so I don't expect to have loved it.  But it could have been a far more fun ride for all of us.  It's a pity it's so limited in this respect.",4,1,5,21 January 2001
American Pie," You've seen this film 1000 times already, but good performances.
","The main reason to see this film is the adorable Chris Klein.  But if you can't get enough movies about hetero teenage kids agonizing over having sex for the first time, you may just love it through and through.  It's silly, and not original, but if you just want to waste some time watching some cute kids, go for it.",3,1,2,11 June 2000
American Beauty," Magnificent. A must-see for all.
","This is likely to be the best film of the year 1999.  The acting and script are fantastic, but best of all it is a movie with a soul.  It is a beautiful message which all need to hear. The movie shows us that there is no alternative in life to being yourself.  To attempt otherwise is a dead end street.I don't expect to see another film this moving for quite some time.",10,0,0,25 September 1999
The Patriot," Absurd & ludicrous misrepresentation of history
","Mel Gibson is hardly new at misrepresenting history.  He completely distorted the facts in 'Braveheart' and now he repeats the trick in 'The Patriot.'  WHY he feels it necessary to so completely distort facts in order to win over the audience to his side is a mystery.  One hardly needs to have pseudo-evil demons to hate in order to take the side of the Scots or the Americans.  But he likes to make sure NO ONE takes the other side, I guess. I wonder what other war Mr. Gibson will try to distort next. 
The violence in this movie is hard to watch.  The story is sweet.  But it is completely lost on me when the situation is painted in such absurd black & white terms.  Brits - evil.  Americans - godly and dear. Things never have been that simple in any war situation, and I sure hope Gibson figures that out before he strikes again.",1,14,30,27 December 2000
Dreamgirls," A Star is Born: Jennifer Hudson; And God bless Bill Condon
","If you want to see a movie that will lift your heart up and make you leave the theatre with a spring in your step, go see 'Dreamgirls.' Jennifer Hudson steals the show. That has to be said above all else. She is simply magical in this film. It's almost as if it was made for her. The girl can ACT, too. Her singing is sublime. What more can you say? She deserves an Oscar for this performance.Also terrific are Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Danny Glover, and Beyonce Knowles. Each if perfect in his or her role. I never knew Eddie Murphy could act THIS well, even though I always loved him. And while I have grown accustomed to Jamie Foxx being perfect at all he does, he showed great depth in this performance, showing how a good man could be drawn into becoming something he probably didn't mean to become. Danny Glover was just beautiful and perfect in his role. And I have to add that it was a delight to see Ken Page playing Max Washington. I had not seen Ken Page since 'Torch Song Trilogy,' in which he was also brilliant. I wish we would see more of him in movies because he is a jewel.The performances are all perfection, but as was the case with the movie 'Chicago,' we know that we have Bill Condon to thank for those spectacular performances coming together so effectively. Bill Condon is truly a genius, and if he doesn't win the Best Director Oscar this year, it will be a gross injustice. I can't wait to see what he makes for us to see next! Bravo! to everyone associated with this magnificent movie.",10,8,17,5 January 2007
The Love Guru," Embarrassingly awful film
","I went to see this movie hoping for lighthearted entertainment, because I have always loved Mike Meyers. I hoped the negative reviews were wrong. But they were oh-so-right. Don't waste your hard-earned money or time on this one.The sight of Ben Kingsley playing a silly cross-eyed Indian guru (who has his apprentices fight with mops dipped in his bodily fluids) is very depressing indeed. To go from playing Gandhi to this is just so, so, so sad.The presence of two gratuitous anti-gay jokes turned an otherwise innocuous movie into an unpleasant experience. Call me crazy, but I don't go to the expense of going to a theatre in order to be insulted. Do Mike Meyers and this film's makers think that gay audience members LIKE to be insulted as we sit there watching their movies? (which we PAID to see!!) I thought the Guru Pitka schtick might be fun, but it wasn't. The only bright spots were Justin Timberlake as a Lothario Quebecquer and the fairly fun Bollywood-style Indian dance number at the end of the movie. Otherwise it is just painfully unfunny and uninteresting.",1,81,150,21 June 2008
Meet Joe Black," Boring
","The most boring film I've seen in years.  Even the nice ending couldn't save it.  Brad Pitt lights up the screen for 10 minutes, then he takes on the world's most boring and silly persona.  Waste of time.",1,1,4,28 July 1999
La La Land," The best of both old and new Hollywood. Astonishing!
","This is one of the best movies I have seen in my 62 years. How often do you hear a theater audience burst into applause in the first 5 minutes? From the spectacular opening of the film you realize that you aren't in Kansas anymore. Anything can and does happen in La La Land. The story involves a young aspiring actress (Emma Stone) who meets a jazz pianist (Ryan Gosling) who is determined to open a jazz club. It should be noted that Gosling actually did his own piano playing in the film! But it is Emma Stone who steals the show here with fabulous singing, dancing, and acting. Emma just graduated to the Great Actresses Club with this performance.The relationship between the actress and pianist has its ups and downs as they seek their dreams. There are moments so beautiful that I wept for joy. I may have to watch this movie many times. It is pure bliss.This movie is hard to describe because it has charming old-fashioned elements yet it is at the same time super-modern. But above all it has a mountain of talent, a great deal of intelligence, and a beautiful heart. You will love it.",10,7,14,18 December 2016
Les Misérables," A masterpiece! Spectacular!
","I was ready for this film to be fabulous due to the incredible talents involved in making it. But being unfamiliar with the story before seeing the movie, I was unaware of how beautiful this story is. Jean Valjean is a hero of the first order. A man who was down and out, but when a priest offered him amazing help, it changed his life.The film is different from the stage show, or so I've read, but it actually adds some things from the book that the stage musical left out. (I've been reading about it nonstop for 3 days now.) And this film is spectacular to watch. Stunning! The cast is superb. If Hugh Jackman & Anne Hathaway don't win Oscars it will be a crying shame. Aaron Tveit is especially good as well.This film is quite long, yet when it came to an end all I could think was 'Gosh, I wish it was longer!' I didn't want it to end. I will probably go see it again next week. It's THAT good.",10,3,5,30 December 2012
The Da Vinci Code," A great thriller! Wow, it is amazing!
","This is the best, most exciting thriller I have ever seen! I find it pretty astonishing that some reviewers have called this film 'boring,' when in reality it doesn't even have ONE MINUTE that you are not on the edge of your seat! First of all, it is a great thriller, and you are always trying to figure out who did it and who the real good guys and bad guys are.Second, the performances are unbelievably good. If Ian McKellan doesn't win an Academy Award for his performance I will be shocked. He was MADE for this role. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou are also perfect for their roles. All the supporting characters were also perfect, from the French FBI agents, to the Opus Dei people, everyone.Third, this movie is stunning just to LOOK at. It is the most visually fascinating film I think I ever saw. Beautiful, amazing, dazzling.Do not believe those who bad-mouth this film. They have an agenda and they are terrified that people will start thinking.",10,1,8,20 May 2006
Wedding Crashers," The worst, absolutely the worst
","This film is a waste of time and it amounts to little more than a giant opportunity to maliciously ridicule gays. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan should be ashamed for participating in this train-wreck of a hate-mongering movie. There is a gratuitously homophobic thread running through the movie. One character is gay, and pretty much the freak of the movie. He is a sexual predator, a weirdo, looks weird, and acts weird. Gay 'Amos and Andy.' Gratuitously anti-gay and a disgrace for a film made in 2005.The movie is dumb - and not nearly as funny as the review in the Washington Post said it was. The Post review neglected to mention the blatant homophobia... and some people say the press is liberal! It was an unnecessary side plot - constructed purely to dehumanize gays.",1,17,36,17 July 2005
Saving Mr. Banks," The best movie of 2013
","I saw this film twice the week it came out. It is magical and glorious. It made me feel so good I had to see it again to figure out why.'12 Years A Slave' and 'Philomena' are incredibly wonderful films which I regard as must-sees, but 'Saving Mr. Banks' hit me in a way that I almost think was religious. The impact of the film is encapsulated in an amazing scene near the end of the film in which Walt Disney tells Pamela Travers why Mary Poppins is so important to him. I don't want to say more or it would be a spoiler, but watch for that scene and don't get up to go to the toilet then!! It is so beautiful.There is a great deal of humor in the film, much of it due to Pamela Travers' eccentricities, but we see very serious flashbacks throughout the film which help us to understand why the Mary Poppins stories were so important to Travers. Colin Farrell does an Oscar-worthy job of portraying the father in those flashbacks.Yes, they changed the true story a bit to make this movie. Apparently Disney and Travers never went to Disneyland together and certain other details were changed. But a lot of it is very real, and they used tapes of meetings between Travers and the Disney folks to recreate some key conversations. At the end of the movie, as the credits roll, they actually play one of those real tapes, so you can see that what you just saw was not unlike the reality of those meetings. I have read a great deal about the making of this film and P.L. Travers and I am impressed with the trouble they went to to make this film. Travers was far too complex to portray her thoroughly in this film, and I forgive the filmmakers for changing certain details. The end result here is far more beautiful than a straight, 100% true bio-pic would be.Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks, Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman, B.J. Novak, Colin Farrell, Ruth Wilson and little Annie Rose Buckley did wonderful jobs portraying their characters. You will want to see this film over and over again.",10,1,4,26 December 2013
300," Very sick movie, almost unimaginably bad
","I work with a normal group of 10 men, all of which saw this movie recently, and we unanimously agreed that this was probably the sickest, most ridiculous, and most boring film ever made. It is really unwatchable. The only reason we watched it is the inexplicable good reviews we have all seen for this movie, but we can only assume that those reviewers were sadomasochists with no interest in historical accuracy or a good story.Why is it sick? I could write a book to answer that question, but briefly, tell me if you do not regard this sick: seeing mounds and mountains of dead Iranian/Persian bodies piled high, with some of them squirming as they die, with Spartans seeking out the squirming bodies so they can spear them a few more times, walking on top of mounds of dead and dying bodies without a care in the world. Or how about seeing a giant wall constructed with boulders AND the bodies of Iranian/Persian soldiers, with arms and legs dangling out of the wall. Those two images are just for starters.There is no reason to care which side wins in the bloody battles between the Spartans and the Persians. Both sides are written to be so detestable that it really is a draw. And then you have to accept that the star of the show is a Spartan with a heavy Scottish accent. There is virtually nothing to hold your interest as far as a story line goes.The sets look so cheesy and I am shocked that this is not the main comment in every review of '300.' Cheesy, cheesy, cheesy. The pace of the movie moves like a snail. And of course there is less than ZERO historic authenticity to any of this. It is a contrivance. But it is also a contrivance of the sickest order. Pure perverse obsession with killing and brutality. This film will have a very seriously negative impact on those children who have no moral guidance at home.Finally, the film is dark and boring in its scenery, which doesn't look real and doesn't look interesting. It very well may be the worst movie ever made. That was the conclusion of the 10 men I work with.",1,5,11,24 September 2007
