Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Legend Continues.
","Hitchcockian noir bids us welcome and 70s Kung Fu provides a wonderfully welcome aside, but above all this film wears its Leone / Ford Fan Club badge with even more prominence than the first instalment. Wondering whether it's as good as Volume 1 is fairly pointless, because this truly is one film in two volumes. Maybe the second film isn't as energetic as the first, but that's to be expected from a conclusion, and the film never really disappoints. It still manages to cram in a scene more horrifying than the hospital bed scene from volume one, & it still manages to have a fight scene even more brutal and cold. If you have no soul you could, at a pinch, say it is less fun than the first. But it's an operatic climax that is deserved and needed and which you'll applaud. Bloke in front of us did anyway.",9,1,2,2 September 2006
Requiem for a Dream," didactic hollering
","I've checked on the internet before writing this review, partly to check there wasn't some joke I was missing out on and partly to see if there weren't plenty of negative reviews to counter the adulatory ones I'd read already. No such luck. This film is universally respected and adored for it's portrayal of drug addiction. Personally I found it to be the most jaw droppingly risible, ham fisted load of old cobblers since Reefer Madness.Mother, son, friend and girlfriend all descend into their own hell over the space of three seasons. It begins with giggling and dieting and, within 9 months, ends in amputation, dementia, electro shock therapy, imprisonment (black boy in a Southern white boy jail) and the insertion of double ended dildos anally in a lesbo gang bang for a bag of smack. The novel (by Last Exit to Brooklyn scribe Hubert Selby Jr) was written in 1978, and maybe in those far off distant dark ages the events of this film could happen. I dare say they could today. But the combination of all these tales within a 98 minute/9 month span (and a fast edited final ten minutes showcasing the simultaneous final consequences for all participants) makes this a laughable, monotonous and ludicrous film whose audacious visual style only serves to make you feel even more patronised by its didactic hollering.",2,19,37,2 September 2006
Minority Report," Spielberg experiments
","Admit it. After Amistad you thought Spielberg was on the wane. After AI you thought he was finished and over the hill. I did. Turns out we were wrong. Turns out he was just honing his skills, experimenting with style and trying to drag himself away from the populist popcorn maker he'd turned himself into.Minority Report is brilliant, brilliant film making. Some have said its Gilliamesque, but that's just the Philip K Dick element - this film has a style, grace, pace and vibrancy all of its own and it's a style we've not seen from Spielberg before. None of his tried and tested trademark shots, but a whole new slew of cinematic nuances that we may well come to view as the trademark shots of his brilliant rebirth. Exciting, thrilling, thought provoking, passionate and emotional - this film is everything AI wasn't. God bless Spielberg.",9,1,2,2 September 2006
Coffee and Cigarettes," Hilarious
","This is probably the most successful of Jarmusch's long series of one-take conversation pieces. As usual the themes are of permanent vacations, of being a stranger at home, of the chess game of social niceties, and of the unity of triviality. Here though each conversation has a series of motifs that underpin the whole, aide de memoires not readily found in Jarmusch's other non-narrative pieces. More importantly most of the vignettes here are hugely entertaining, usually playing on perceived images of the actors themselves (Cate Blanchett playing dual roles as movie star and overly down to earth jealous cousin; Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan playing tag team Englishness on the Hollywood ladder; Jack White showing Meg White his Tesla coil...). It's a great conversation starter of a film.",8,0,1,2 September 2006
Insomnia," the concept of crime
","Al Pacino, for all his greatness, has ostensibly played two characters for most of his career - mainly the cocksure, occasionally the desperate. Here though, he plays a character who projects both but is neither; for the first time he plays ambiguity, uncertainty and confusion with a subtlety we knew was there but never got much evidence for. His career best performance as the pulp novel cop travelling a Heart of Darkness narrative (with a little bit of Macbeth thrown in for good measure) is equally matched by the direction of Chris Nolan, and by the actor playing the killer (convincingly played lest you should hear different elsewhere). Memento's memory loss mcguffin is here presented as film noir cliché, since Insomnia presents us with the real world; memories of crimes are not the issue, the issue here is the concept of 'crime' itself.",9,0,0,2 September 2006
Lost in Translation," Very funny, never Hollywood romantic
","If you're surprised by the subtleties of Bill Murray's acting here, then you can blame your surprise on most of his previous directors, who always had it available to them but rarely chose to showcase it. Sofia Coppola's direction dips its toe in a documentary style that compliments well her script, which never verbalises what doesn't need to be. With this approach, Murray and Scarlett Johansson are left to show us a hesitant relationship whose only foundation is a shared feeling of being lost in life's choices; of having no direction and no one else around to understand them. This is a film that captures boredom, that explores companionship, and that recognises the need for a special moment being left as just a moment. Very funny, never Hollywood romantic and almost constantly affecting, once this arrives on DVD it could well be a film to wallow in on the sofa.",9,1,2,2 September 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," a fan-boys wet dream
","Sam Jackson delivering kick ass lines then kicking ass. Ewan McGregor truly perfecting his Alec Guinness impression. The comedy double act of Artoo and Threepio reunited to great effect at last. Natalie Portman in some extremely fetching outfits. Hayden Christiensen in some of perhaps the only truly (convincing) emotional scenes of the entire saga thus far......and Yoda, swinging his light sabre and whirling round the screen like a Tazmanian Devil.This is a fan-boys wet dream.Unlike (it's claimed) many, I liked Phantom Menace, and I like this too. But whereas Phantom Menace stuck very rigidly to the structure and directing style the first trilogy had, this treads new ground. The war scenes are now actual war scenes, bordering on a documentary style at times. And the explosive last act no longer has the multiple story arcs we've come to expect (Empire, Jedi and Phantom Menace) but instead a single linear strand (A New Hope).Lucas' reaction to all the criticism that Phantom was all politics and chatter? He's put in even more politics and chatter - this has the most complex plot yet, which makes it something special indeed. A lot of things become clearer, a lot of things become yet more mysterious (The brilliantly Machiavellian double, triple and quadruple dealings of Darth Sidious / Palpatine beg for a triumphantly evil gloat of a monologue from him somewhere in episode three).Everyone said Phantom held the promise of a kick ass episode two. Episode two is kick ass, but it in turn holds the promise of a fantastically kick ass episode three. Glory be.",9,0,1,2 September 2006
The Matrix Revolutions," anticlimactic but the only logical conclusion
","When you see the screen filled with a trillion sentinels amidst a golden hail of bullets your jaw WILL drop I promise you. The film's opening needs thirty or so dull minutes to tie up loose ends from the previous film. Once it gets going, it's business as usual. The pointless, passionless annoying love story continues. The dialogue within the Matrix remains magnificently stilted; the dialogue outside of the Matrix remains appallingly stilted. Minor characters are used effectively, if a little cheesily. The finale is inevitably anticlimactic, as anyone who has worked out the reality of rewriting the source code will probably expect. But whilst it's a whimper rather than a bang, it's the only logical conclusion possible to this geek fantasy of the Hacker Messiah. But it could so easily have been one film instead of two",7,0,0,2 September 2006
Spider-Man," basically a very nice remake by Raimi of his film Darkman
","I don't want to sound like a movie geek (heaven forbid), but this is basically a very nice remake by Raimi of his film Darkman.The script is uninspiringly blunt at times, particularly in the preamble, and there's honestly not a lot of action when all's said and done (like X-Men, it feels like a promo for a series). There's quite a bit of post Sept 11th New Yorker flag waving too (nothing wrong with that). On the other hand Kirsten Dunst looks FANTASTIC, and all three main leads have always been brilliant actors (and the Bruce Campbell cameo is hilarious).Entertaining; it would be churlish not to enjoy this stylish comic book hokum.",6,0,0,2 September 2006
Collateral," rubbish
","First off, I can't remember liking any Michael Mann movie, so bear that in mind when reading this review. Collateral is terrible. The dialogue, set up, plot and execution are all overblown and over-stylised. Tom Cruise's hair is the most absurd thing on view though, although given the video game chic this film seems to be aiming for it is at least just as pixel perfect as everything else on offer. Some director's coach great performances from their actors; Mann bludgeons forced performances from his and always has, the twitches and gurnings on show evidence of the marionette strings he wields. If you enjoy cliché writ large and in a flourishy font, you may enjoy this brainless play.",4,3,5,8 May 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," intense, exciting, moving, operatic
","Postmodern is a daft concept used by pseudo intellectuals when describing dull films by other pseudo intellectuals. Kill Bill is not post modern. Its few filmic jokes are there because they work not because they reference something. Its obvious hyper reality is coupled with some intensely emotional moments, that work because of the brilliance of the actress Tarantino has employed to star in this violent opera, and because of whichever brilliant anime artist he got to direct the superb animated sequence of the film. It is clear that, irrespective of Kill Bill's Hong Kong / Anime / Karate Film subject and action, this film owes it's greatest debt to Sergio Leone. And it is high praise indeed when I say that this film not only captures the stylish extremes and beauties of Once Upon a Time in the West, it may even surpass them. As with previous films Tarantino subverts linearity; this is once again in order to fabricate a Hollywood narrative NOT to be arty or postmodern or pseudo intellectual. It's done cos we dumb audiences like an emotional beginning, middle and end. So reviewers for God's sake take note; Tarantino chapters his film cos it's cool not cos its arty; he moves backwards and forwards in time cos it's cool and he needs to not cos it's arty; he references other films cos it's cool and it works not cos it's arty. This film works; it's cool and it's an intense, exciting, moving, operatic, finely crafted masterpiece.",9,0,2,2 September 2006
Big Fish," not classic but...
","Initially I wasn't enjoying this film; the characters I was meant to like I didn't, and the characters I was meant to dislike I liked (poor old Don Price, what did he ever do?). But this changed as the tall tales progressed. To be sure, there's nothing surprising about the direction it heads in and the conclusions it reaches; you always know that eventually all participants will agree that if the legend is more exciting than the truth then print the legend. But there's something in the telling that makes the trip enjoyable, and like any tall tale this one may just improve with a few more retellings. This is a film about a man whose recollections of possibly dull encounters become taller and taller with each telling. I have a friend like that.",7,1,1,2 September 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Kaufman genius
","Ingrates that we are, we've probably grown unappreciatively accustomed to Charlie Kaufman's mind game comedies of late. Certainly there's more than a echo of the tone set by Being John Malkovich here. But what separates Eternal Sunshine is that it is no mere flight of fantasy, no mere intellectual plaything of a film. It's a stonking great moving, emotional, true, hilarious, joyful success of a film, with nary a hair out of place in its dissection of memory, love, motivation and life. It distills and dissects every corner and corridor of the question it asks itself with precision, purity and pleasure whilst never over egging the pudding. It always finds exactly the right direction to go in at exactly the right time and constantly entertains the audience. It's been a few years since I've seen a film where I not only don't know how it will end, but am actually keen to find out. The ending didn't disappoint. This will find its way into my DVD collection very, very quickly.",10,0,3,2 September 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," Fixes the flaws of the first film and makes a damn sight more sense
","I didn't like the Matrix. It was entertaining and loud and visually brilliant, but it's plot was meaningless. It seemed vacuous in its reliance on 'fate' and 'destiny'. All the reviewers loved it though. They decided all that fate and destiny was intelligent.The Matrix Reloaded I LOVE. Adore. Worship. It is genius. We see Morpheus not as the Obi-Wan po-faced mystic as in the first film, but Morpheus the blinkered, egocentric new-ager unable to see reality. Elements of the Matrix itself that were seen as unexplainable mysticism in the first (because the first film is filtered through Morpheus) are now explained and the concept suddenly seems intelligent to me where it didn't before.But I'm an IT geek; a nerd with a toehold on the subject that the Wachowski's here provide brilliant and entertaining metaphor for. The plethora of negative reviews for this film complain it is MORE mystical and up its arse than the first; that there is far LESS plot than the first. Such fat, balding middle aged cretins should not be allowed to review this film, because they are unable to see that it has far MORE plot than the first; the subtleties of the IT characterisations here made the geek in me laugh out loud. Negative reviewers listen too closely to Morpheus - yes he spouts gibberish mysticism, THAT'S THE POINT DULLARDS. He's a mad man.There is plenty to entertain here. The action sequences truly are like nothing seen before, even if the larger fight sequences are a little too 'animated'. The film could well do without the ridiculous post watershed music video sequence in Zion (you'll know it when you see it), but you'll have forgotten that by the time you reach the end and the final twist in the machine humanity battle leaves you eager to learn what new evolution this series will lead to. The first film was gamers. The second film is hackers. The geek army can't wait for what the third will bring.",9,1,2,2 September 2006
