The Blair Witch Project," I love scary movies
",I love scary movies and this was one of the scariest I've ever seen. The only problem is that it's only scary the first time you see it because you know what happens. This movie was a breathe of fresh air for this old horror buff's lungs.,8,0,1,7 March 2000
