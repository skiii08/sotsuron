Howl's Moving Castle," A profound and exhilarating Miyazaki creation!
","Howl's Moving Castle is phenomenal. Presenting itself initially in an odd way, our protagonist Sophie seems somewhat dry and dull. But this lasts only a few moments until a series of fantastical characters pour into her world. Each of these characters, whether it be Calcifer, Markl, Turniphead, the Witch of the Waste (during the last half) or the quiet dog are immediately likable from the get go. You genuinely care about them and their constant references to one another as a family only make the group seem all the more close. It's not very often I'm immediately pulled in by a group of characters but the colorful cast of Howl's Moving Castle are quick to bore a place in memory.The animation quality is also superb. Vibrant colors and visuals fill every frame and a great attention to detail is thoroughly evident from beginning to end. Though at times it may seem very basic in style, take a second look as every frame holds something distinctively unique and profound in its beautiful fashion. Howl's dazzling transformations are superbly animated throughout his personal endeavors of self-loathing, missing love, and thirst for power. Wheteher he be taking the form of an enormous blue bird or enshrouding himself in the company of dark spirits during a bout of depression, Howl is a spectacle all on his own. The castle he inhabits along with his family is also a treat to the senses. Other than the obviousness of how distinctively creative and complex the outermost appearance of the moving castle is; the magical functions it performs are just as remarkable and interesting. This magnificent creation serves not only as a haven to our heroes but also as a portal to both time and space. It is a mystical labyrinth filled with humorous and surprising secrets and feats at every turn.The film has a lot to say on love, life, loyalty, war, bravery, and family. And it succeeds gracefully in bringing all these themes together in a very thoughtful and stirring manner. By the films end there is a lot left lingering with you. I found myself thinking about the film as a whole long into the credits' enchanting music. The overall brilliance of its unfolding story, captivating characters, moving relationships, strong themes, elegant visual beauty, and thrilling conflicts is more than I've experienced in a long time in terms of animated films. Yes his last too works Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke were also brilliantly captivating, but Howl's Moving Castle just stood out to me as something extra special in Miyazaki's body of work with Studio Ghibli.I have seen all of Miyazaki's films with the exception of Kiki's Delivery Service and must say that Howl's Moving Castle is one of Miyazaki's most impressive accomplishes to date. The Academy Award for Best Animated Picture was robbed from this delightful and exciting adventure. I'd have to say that Howl's Moving Castle is my second favorite Miyazaki film, surpassed only by Nausicaa of The Valley of th Wind. Like Nausicaa, this film was grossly overlooked by both general viewers and critics alike. Heres hoping that the DVD release garners more great rating from viewers on this deserving gem.",10,3,4,8 March 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Easily the best of the first half of 2006.
","So far this year has definitely started on a weak note with films coming out. Sure there have been plenty of entertaining popcorn flicks like Talladega Nights, Superman, and Pirates Of The Caribbean 2. And the horror film genre has made leaps and bounds with releasing Hostel, The Hills Have Eyes, Slither, and The Descent which are all a major step forward from the recent crap in horror films that have come out over the previous 3 years (and yes the Descent doesn't really count cause it was released in Britain last year). But then comes along Little Miss Sunshine and completely renews hope in a better last half to the year.Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed plenty of the theatrical releases so far this year but Little Miss Sunshine is definitely in a league of its own compared to the others. The basic story follows a very dysfunctional family on an eye opening journey across the country to enter young Olive into a pageant contest.What I found most impressive was that the movie not only managed to be extremely funny regardless of its sometimes very dark themes, but the performances were phenomenal. Especially those of Steve Carrel, Greg Kinnear and Paul Dano. Carrel has without a doubt proved his potential as an actor with this one. When you first see him in the film its utterly shocking as he is sitting in a hospital chair after just having attempted to commit suicide. As the movie unfolds he obviously unleashes his humor but it is very sophisticated, natural, and professional. His oddball characters of Brick Tambland from Anchorman and Andy Stitzer from 40 Year Old Virgin pale in comparison to what he's created with Frank. Of course his other roles have been hilarious and great but in Little Miss Sunshine he really outdoes himself. Greg Kinnear was also very surprising. At first you hate the guy as he present himself as a very egotistic, mean, and somewhat uncaring man but as the story unfolds he takes this character and makes him something great. Then there's Paul Dano, the son of the family and textbook depressed teen. Yet again a character that is funny but seems very typical and kind of boring until about the midway point when he unleashes an amazing performance in quite possibly one of the most emotional sequences in the film.So make time for Little Miss Sunshine. If you've seen all the big releases for the summer or even if your just looking for something dynamic and interesting, a change from the popcorn flicks, then make this the movie you see for the evening. Simply put its great and shouldn't be missed.",10,4,8,30 August 2006
28 Days Later...," Dodges many of the faults that make most horror movies fall flat.
","Nowadays, truly scary movies are hard to come by. People are subjected to a lot of WRETCHED horror films that contain poor character development, lousy dialogue, cheap thrills, and pointless plots. Most of the horror movies that have been released lately really don't offer much of anything to be honest.
With that in mind, one might assume that '28 Days Later' would simply be another one of those pointless/tedious films that slowly diminishes the intelligence of its viewers with poorly written stories chock full of mindless gore.Well, I can honestly say that; in my opinion, 28 Days Later has managed to dodge many of these great faults that are usually very common in the horror genre. The film-makers have succeeded in bringing to the audience a terrifying story of primal violence and desperate survival in an apocalyptic world. The film is primarily a story showing the brutal aftermath of a deadly epidemic known as the 'Rage'. Those infected have entered into a state of blood-lust, driven only by a hunger for the flesh and blood of those who have not yet been subjected to the virus. We are shown only clips and portions of the chaos that had followed the outbreak. Massive riots and stories of barbaric killings are told through newspaper clippings and explanations given by other survivors. All of this and much more sets the tone of the movie from the start. Bringing us in immediately.
But beyond all of this is a simple tale of human nature. 28 Days Later captures the realistic circumstances of survival, highlighting the various ways people cope with things in such horrendous times. Throughout the course of the film, we come across about 13 non-infected people with entirely different personalities and entirely different means of survival. They all have their own opinions on how to survive, and they've all learned to cope with the conditions in their own way. its this aspect of the movie that really caught my interest.Was the movie flawless? No not at all. NO MOVIE IS FLAWLESS. But like a few other memorable cinematic experiences, 28 Days Later presented something new. It was gritty, weird, wild, and creepy. Just the right mix to give us a break from the typical/cruddy box office 'hits' Hollywood coughs up every month. 10 out of 10. Full points for being the most entertaining movie I've seen in theaters so far this year.",10,0,1,28 June 2003
Princess Mononoke," Mononoke Hime is this centuries last '5 Star' anime.
","Mononoke Hime is this centuries last '5 Star' anime. Its captivating story, amazing visuals, and intense characters are merely a cover for the true lesson being told. Its a story which forcasts the lifelong battle between our Earth and those who walk upon it. But even more meaningful, the battle every one of us fights each waking moment of our life deep inside as we struggle to find our place in this world.Each character in Mononoke Hime is facing these very same struggles. On one side we have those who want to improve themselves but feel it is necessary to destroy what is around them in order to achieve it. Then on the other side we have natures Gods which are fighting to preserve the origins of life but are laying blame on a single race when it is all who is at fault. Finally there is the man stuck between both, confused as to why they are fighting a war when they could simply just find a way to coexist.While simple at first glance, there is a lot of complexity to the movie in terms of morals and beliefs. Missing out on this brilliantly made piece of art would be a crime.",10,0,1,10 June 2002
