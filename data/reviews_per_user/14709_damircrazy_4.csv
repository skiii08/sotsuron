Dunkirk," More drama than action
","First 20 minutes, amazing, action, interesting, mystery atmosphere. Than movie goes from action to drama, and becomes boring, story start to drag too much, nothing specially happening, and music have too much presence, and its announcing something that never happens on screen, its just boosting the drama and atmosphere, but with no real credit and reason for it.Im disappointed, cause i was expecting movie at the level of Saving Private Ryan or Enemy at the Gates, but this is not action oriented as mush as those movies, and there is no blood and gore, and difficult moments, and i feel like they are missing.Film have quality, i love this director, but it is slow, and it is more of a drama, and that is something i don't like, its worth a look, sound is done amazing. I would say it worth to see it in cinema if u have nothing better to do, otherwise, DVD or blue ray, and home looking are better option in my opinion. I gave this movie 7 out of 10, best regards, Damir.",7,1,7,23 July 2017
1917," The most boring war movie ever
","I watched the movie, I haven't watched such a boring movie in a long time, and this is even war movie witch i generaly really like, so I think this is the most boring war movie in history.
I watched it expecting some action, something that would save it, but to no avail.It got those Oscars, for like a single shot, although of course they made transitions at least at dozen places, but they neatly masked it with editing tricks and movie record tricks.
It's boring when everything is in one frame, there is no dynamic, it is more immersive, but that would much more feet action movie, not this boring drama ... 4/10",4,1,1,20 February 2020
