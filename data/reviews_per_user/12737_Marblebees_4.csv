Skyfall," Don't listen to all the others - this is an old dog with new tricks
","This is not the same bond as the one before and now I'm talking about the old bond. Many complain that this movie steers away from bond being classy and invisible. But it does that for the better. If you just open your mind and take in this modern bond you will see its great. And maybe i just think this because I'm a different generation. I didn't grow up with the old bond movies - but the new ones. I did see the old ones first though. The new bond is of course not the same - but he still makes good movies. Now let me break down pros and consPROS:Great villain! The villain in this movie is just awesome. He seems like the sort of type that could just snap at any moment and kill everyone. He was awesomely acted - and VERY well presented. But the most important thing is that he is memorable!Awesome action scenes! The action packed scenes here live up to the Bond legacy. But they have a pinch of the new bond in them. They are intense, cinematic and creative. And they are EXTREMELY entertaining!Interesting spin on the Bond story In this movie Bond is not what he usually is. Hes more human than ever and more vulnerable as well. This could lead to a boring and insulting movie, but instead it shows us Bonds way back into action. This makes the story more intense and engaging!Great acting! Nothing more to say - great actingPerfect effects Finally a movie that embraces practical effects so much! All of the effects are well done and look awesome! and for the few computer generated effects (like the great intro) they are also cinematic and well done!CONS:Some strange plot points There are weird small plot holes here and there - some things just seem like they wouldn't happenQuantum of Solace spots Small spots of Bourne like scenes - much like in Quantum of Solace. Although there are only a few here.All in all - the top reviewers just cling to much to the old bond. Go in and be impressed and entertained by the intense action awesome villain and different plot.8/10",8,1,6,27 December 2013
Now You See Me," Goes to big and ends up stumbling across the finish line
","I was hyped for watching Now You See Me. And for the first half of the movie i was enjoying it (even though there were a lot of plot holes). But what this movie does wrong is that it tries to be something more than what it actually is. I expected the magic to be clever and based in reality. Some of it was - but some of these tricks were just so fancy that they were boring.Example: (MINOR Spoiler INCOMING, SKIP IF UNWANTED) At one point in the movie they are doing magic with bubbles, and one of the three horsemen jumps into a giant bubble and starts floating around over the audience. Now don't get me wrong - seeing this in real life would blow my mind. But it just seems impossible to explain and that just makes it boring in a way, and i takes me out of the movie. Every magic show always has that one final trick that blows everyones mind. Its like this movie tried to make every trick be that - but it just doesn't work that way.(SPOILER OVER) The movie over does many magic tricks, and also ends up over doing the entire plot. The plot twist in this movie has so many holes in it.Lets set up pros and consPROS - entertaining and sparkling! there is almost no points in this movie where you are bored. It throws in entertainment in every scene. That is if you can overlook all of the plot holes and at times cheesy dialog<ul><li>Cinematography is excellent. When some magic tricks are explained you fly around and see things from interesting angels in exiting ways</li></ul><ul><li>Great casting. A lot of the casting of this movie is great. And almost everyone pulls their weight. But it seems that some loose interest towards the later parts of the movie and lose their passion.</li></ul>CONS - TONS of plot holes. There are so many cheesy inexplainable things that happen at every turn at this movie. And in the end of the overly complex story line your just sitting there unsatisfied. The passion was there, but there just wasn't enough thought behind it all and it ends up being plain stupid.<ul><li>At times cheesy dialog. Exactly as said, cheesy lines in bound.</li></ul><ul><li>to much of everything. i can take a complex story, if it unfolds in good passing and in good style. But it just seems that they tried to cram in so much at the same time with no thought. This is a movie that places quantity over quality and puts in as much sparkle as possible. Too many subplots.</li></ul><ul><li>bad character development. It tries it best to make us feel for some of the characters but again it fails in this regard. It just feels crammed in. You just don't care.</li></ul><ul><li>To many lens flares. It needs to stop SERIOUSLY ITS IN ALMOST EVERY SHOT OF THE MOVIE!</li></ul>All in all - worth watching and entertaining if you just turn of your brain for a while. This is truly a Vegas gambling style movie. looks exiting but its just full of crap and in the end you just feel like you haven't gotten your monies worth.",5,1,2,11 December 2013
28 Days Later...," Thrilling and engaging all the way through!
","I had heard a lot of 28 days later before i saw it. I had seen some scenes from it and heard the music. Overall i was expecting a 7/10 movie, great movie - but not a to memorable one. But i was BLOWN AWAY. Some of the scenes in this movie had me rolling around on the couch in stress. The way this movie presents everything makes it atmospheric and extremely intense.So pros and consPROS: - as i said - THRILLING AND ENGAGING ALL THE WAY THROUGH. And that is one of this movies biggest pros. The atmosphere of seeing central London totally abandoned gave me goose bumps. The action packed scenes are simple yet intense and effective. The low budget forced the creators to use cinematography and sound at its best - and they succeeded.<ul><li>Feels real. This movie seems so real in the way its made. The small details everywhere are amazing.</li></ul><ul><li>Fitting music. This movie has a soundtrack that i sometimes just sit down and listen to, because its just so good. It has slow builds and when it all drops you have pure awesomeness.</li></ul><ul><li>Cinematography. The camera angles and tricks in this movie make are some of the things that makes it special. Simple and effective at making you feel afraid and full of adrenaline.</li></ul><ul><li>Sets are awesome and give you goose bumps. Some of these sets gave me goosebumps (especially abandoned London) they are just so well thought out.</li></ul><ul><li>Its simple. No over the top CGI, no cheap jump scares - this movie is better than that, its simple. And that makes it great. Simple camera angles. Simple scenes. With PERFECT execution. That is what makes it intense</li></ul>CONS:<ul><li>A few things that seem like they wouldn't happen... but thats about it</li></ul>All in all this movie is a masterpiece - near perfect zombie horror that returns to the former glory of horror films9/10",9,1,3,13 December 2013
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Sigh
","I'm gonna start off by saying that i loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy to death. When i heard Peter Jackson was returning with the hobbit i was excited to death. However i have now got nothing left but a bitter taste in my mouth. First the good:Martin Freeman is perfect as Bilbo. Simple as that. Perfect. Every scene he is in he raises the movies enjoyment level, even given the weak material he was given.The entertainment factor of seeing thousands of orcs/dwarfs/elves fighting is undeniable. It may be cheap, but honestly it is one of the best parts of the movie (And that really says a lot when it doesn't even come close to LOTR)And those are pretty much the only positive points i have.Now the bad:Horrible, horrible writing ruins all tension, and turns cheesy and laughable way way to often. It's not OK for this kind of movie to go into the same kind of comedy you could expect from an Adam Sandler movie. It's just not. Where the LOTR humor never felt like it broke the atmosphere and seriousness of everything, it's just insane how much it ruins any connection you have to the movie. And it's laughable when the movie takes itself so seriously and yet throws so cheap jokes in your face. It gives me a bad taste in my mouth.CGI priorities the shiny above the believable. Why does everything look like it's had an instagram filter put over it? The color grading in LOTR was perfect, always changing to a new shade of color with every scene - and it always looked perfect. Here it just looks overexposed and cheap. And i know that since the hobbit is more of a children's book its supposed to be a little more colorful and cartoony or whatever - but honestly it looks horrible.The plot here is beyond convenient. It's a combination of Peter Jackson doing everything he can to connect this movie to the LOTR trilogy, and stretching so few pages of the book to much film time. When a character is saved at the last minute, 10 times through the movie it just ends up being laughable. This script could seriously have been written by a twelve year old, and it would have been the same.Spectacle > Logic. Legolas apparently has the ability to defy the laws of physics. Honestly i'm not gonna spoil what happens, but you'll know when you see it. I don't think i have ever laughed so hard at something that was supposed to be cool or bad ass.No emotional connection to any characters at all. It just makes everything much worse when you can tell the movie wants you to get sad, but you just don't. BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO CONNECTION TO ANYONE.SPOILER: Smaug dies 10 min in?!??!?! WTF, he was the BEST dragon to ever have been put on any screen EVER. He was the best part of the desolation of smaug, and cumberbatch was perfect as him. And then he just dies after a year of build up after the ending of the last movie.All in all i don't think i have ever sighed so much in a movie before. It's just pathetic how badly this movie was handled.",4,1,3,21 April 2015
