Gremlins," NAUGHTY
","Hi ho , hi ho , it's off to work we go. I wish I could say this on Monday mornings after I get up. But on the weekends it's a different story when I watch this movie. I first got it a few years ago and I was ashamed of myself after waiting all these years. Gizmo was cute and innocent but after those rules were broken , here come the mean and gricous Gremlins. No matter how vicious they were or playing tricks on people much less getting drunk in a bar , these were the bad guys and you had to expect anything.",Null,0,1,25 October 2003
Rocky V," One More Round
","Actually I didn't think it was all that bad. It wasn't as exciting as the other episodes but it made sense.Rocky finally retires , goes broke , and ends up where it all started. I liked the scene whene he went to Mickey's gym and thought of that memory. Another one was when Tommy challenged Rocky to a fight but he just walked away and it went on. And after all these years Paulie said something that you can give him credit for. The only thing I didn't like was when Rocky gave Tommy Apollo's shorts. That was going too far. If they were going to remember him they could of done it in a better way.",Null,10,12,6 December 2002
Alien," live or die
","There are some science fiction movies we may stay with at one time such as Star Wars or Star Trek but sooner or later it'll come to an end. As for Alien , it'll keep on going. There's no telling how many times I've watched it and I enjoy it every time. It's so realistic it'll make you think - what if something like this actually could happen ? It still freaks me out when I see that chestbuster scene and when they discover what's on Kane's face when they return from the spaceship. I give it a 10.As for the second , sure those marines were tough and ready to fight , but the sad part is they had no idea what they were going to fight. This gets a 9.",Null,0,1,6 January 2003
Grease," We'll Always Be Together
","Hey people , if some of you never knew this but back in 98 Didi Conn made a book of Grease since it was the 20th year anniversary. It's titled 'Frenchy's Grease Scrapbook.' It has alot of information about the movie and pictures as well. Call your bookstore and get a copy now ! now !I love the movie but there was one thing that let me down. During the warm up dance , Rock & Roll is Here to Stay , that was too short. That's a good , fast , dancing song and if it went just a little bit longer.",Null,1,2,27 September 2002
Grease," Now & Then
","There's no telling how many times I've watched this movie and there's no telling how many more will come. I've always enjoyed it but I keep forgetting the 'Blue Moon ' scene which cracks me up. I also enjoy the high school dance off and the moves that they do. To me this seems like it would be pretty fun.Now from the way I see it , this movie gives you a pretty good example of how kids would act and the way they dressed. Just like Back to the Future.The songs were good also but I have to say there might be a slight caution in Greased Ligtnin for kids. At times it's good to see movies like this when things were safe and calm compared of how it is now.",Null,1,2,25 September 2002
Grease," RE : I just don't get it
","GlenysThom , after reading your letter I'll try to help you the best I can.To start off with , from what it sounds like you're a little bit out of line from the way Sandy was dressed at the end of the movie. The reason she did this is because she had to change somehow and wanted to get Danny's attention once and for all. Listen to the song at the end of the car race. After all this time she had been a little church mouse and wasn't making any progress , she changed into a mountain lion that no one ever expected.
As for Danny , the reason he treated her like he did at the football game is because he had a reputation to keep as a T - Bird like his buddies. Even when he was with them , at times you could tell she was on his mind.
During the movie you could tell they had something for each other no matter what happened and wouldn't give up.As for the song , I'll have to agree with you but I didn't write it.",Null,1,3,29 September 2002

Spider-Man," A Pumpkin Bomb
","I hate to say it but I was a little bit disappointed also. I couldn't wait to see it, especially watching that crazy Green Goblin. I'm a true comic fan but when I picked up a magazine and saw his picture on the cover I didn't know what it was. After I found out I thought this had to be a joke.When he appeared in the movie I just shook my head. This Goblin looked more like a robot.( Or The Jackal for all of you that know who I'm talking about )What happened to his purple costume ? And his jet glider. The head on it looked like a bird. That could of been better. The glider itself was ok.I liked the battle he fought with Spider - Man after he kid-napped Mary Jane and how it came to an end. In my opinion I think it would of been better if the Goblin called Spider - Man Parker instead of wall crawler etc. during their battles since he knew who he was. Kristen Dunst did her part well and I'll give credit for the specialeffects also.",Null,0,0,12 October 2002
Spider-Man," The Joker
","If I had known it was going to be like this I would of stayed home. To start off with , Peter's first girlfriend wasn't Mary Jane - it was a blonde by the name of Gwen Stacy and it would of been better off if she was in it. However Mary Jane was a tomboy and was always waiting to make a move for Peter. Also when he got bitten by this spider , it happened when he was in college - not high school. And was this how he would actually spin his web - just touch his palm and it came out of his wrists as if it were blood ? I don't think so. As for the Goblin's costume , he looked like some kind of robot. His mouth didn't even move when he talked. And most of the time when he would fight Spider - Man when they were alone , since he knew who he was he would call him Parker. If they did this in the movie that would of made it better.There was one scene when his spider - sense warned him of danger when it shouldn't have. I believe Flash Thompson tried to hit Peter from behind and he moved. His senses are only supposed to warn him from his enemies - not his friends. The only part I liked was when the Goblin captured Mary Jane and took her to the bridge and how he died. At least this part was correct with a certain comic story. Except it wasn't Mary Jane.I believe I've said enough. For all you true fans that plan on going to see the second one , good luck.",Null,0,0,20 August 2002
Caddyshack," Fore !
","I'll watch this movie at times but whenever I do , I have to skip the scenes when Chevy Chase comes in because he was such a jerk. I can't stand that part when he's doing his special ' putting trick ' and what he's saying. Plus the time when he was with Danny. One scene that was unexcueseable was that sex scene. This had nothing to do with golf. The only reason this was in the movie is because the girl was paid an extra ten grand to show her self. If you have the 20th anniversary she'll say it during the interview.My favorite actor was Bill Murray. Blowing up the golf course at the end and watching that Gopher run for his life was probably the best part.",Null,0,0,31 July 2002
Black Hawk Down," MEDICS
","This is about as realistic as it gets but I never could figure out why they would show someone in the military that had epilepsy. There's one scene when someone had a seizure and if he actually had a gun he could of shot someone or himself. During a seizure a person does not know what he / she is doing. Before he joined they should of known about his health condition due to this reason. I know this because I have it myself and this scene is a little bit emotional but for all of you that have not witnessed one , this is what it's like. During that time someone also said ' Put a spoon in his mouth ' . People , do not do this and as for all you medics , PLEASE give us time to recover before you take us to the hospital.",Null,1,2,23 March 2003
Carrie," A Thriller
","This will always be one of my favorite horror movies. The first time I saw it was on tv after reading about it and thought it was going to be pretty good. It blew my mind away and I had to get the video. However, I couldn't believe the girl's locker room scene which I thought was going to be a lot of steam like the tv show.Sissy Spacek ( Carrie ) and her crazy mother ( Piper Laurie )made the perfect couple. And from what their house looked like , it fit them just right.My favorite part is when she gets revenge on everyone at the Prom. The music was good, she's standing there not moving a muscle with her eyes wide opened, the fire hose is attacking everyone like a snake, they're yelling and screaming for help, then all hell breaks loose. It just doesn't get any better.if anyone would like to talk to me about this movie or any other please e - mail",9,0,0,14 July 2002
