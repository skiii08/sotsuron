Ali," Maybe I missed something while munching on my popcorn
","I have hoped for a lot from this movie, but maybe I missed something while munching on my popcorn. Yes, the acting was fine - but the disjoint time-line / story-line had me wishing I'd gone for a chock-bomb. Maybe its also an American thing or my lack of familiarity with the whole civil rights movement from the time - but unfortunately this movie left me quite confused. 1/10.",1,3,6,18 April 2002
Being John Malkovich," A must see for 2000
",I saw this movie twice on board a Singapore Airlines flight from Australia to Manilla via Singapore. They had to ply me from the seat to stop me watching this great movie a third time. You MUST see this movie.,8,0,1,25 April 2000
Resident Evil," Gore, glorious gore.
","Fast. Furious. Fabulous!If you are a fan of the PlayStation game of the name, then you will NOT be disappointed. Unlike most other movies that are based on games (ie. Wing Commander), Resident Evil is so close of the game that it scared me more than the nasties on the screen. Okay, so the plot is a tad thin, and the memory loss thing is just a bit too convenient, nevertheless I enjoyed the rollercoaster ride that this movie provided.In a nutshell its blood, gore, sexy ladies and damn nasty zombies. The movied played out as nicely as the game and so I figured it was a good way to spend a almostly drizzly afternoon.8/10.",8,0,0,5 May 2002
The Truman Show," How will it end?
","In the 'The Truman Show', Jim Carrey comes of age. Not only is he funny, but I found the movie to be somewhat of a satire on the entire movie industry. Darkly funny, strangely sad, I enjoyed every moment.The plot centres on Truman and his Hollywood made world. A world where he is the unwitting star and everyone is in on it. There the entire world is witness to every moment of Truman Burbanks incredible life - a life carefully orchestrated by Christof. A movie producer driven to wrench every emotion from Turman, no matter the consequence.Like Citizen Cane's 'rosebud', the shirt button 'How will it end?' is sure to become an icon of this fine movie.",9,0,0,5 October 1998
