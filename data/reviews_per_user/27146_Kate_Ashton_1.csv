"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Gorgeous, gregarious eyecandy-- mixed with heartwarming hilarity!
","By far one of the most visually exciting movies I have ever seen; 'Priscilla' is open, comfortable, and puts true meaning to 'FAAAABULOUS!'!! Although you have to think fast to keep up with the clever Aussie dialogue, zingy one-liners made by Terence Stamp (Ralph/Bernadette)will summon the giggles for hours afterword! Keep an ear out for a great soundtrack that will make you want to run out and buy the record (I did); but nothing tops the amazing creations of the makeup and costume artists. This is THE movie for anyone who loves all things theatrical, fun, and grooving to their own funky beat. Shake your groove thing!",10,1,2,9 January 2001
