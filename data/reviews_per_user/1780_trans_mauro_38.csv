Black Swan," The Black Turkey
","Ah! Another artsy-farty film about an artsy-fartsy subject made for the artsy-fartsy crowd.... TBS is a tedious, stagnant and derivative film that goes absolutely nowhere. Well, one wonders, what can be as exciting as the backstage story of a young lady competing to be the prima ballerina in a new production of The Black Swan? Not much really, because under normal circumstances there is nothing going on in this type of environment, unless one is interested in underweight, monomaniac girls with inflated egos whose main objective in life consists of perfecting the vacuosity of dancing... On top of that, TBS is a film whose characters (without exception) are despicable. The main character, Nina, for instance, could easily be described as a pathetic, anorexic, obsessive and psychologically weak young lady. Her mother is an abusive, bitter, has-been type of person. Nina's friend (if we may call her that...)is a dancer who smokes(a clear sign of the presence of the tobacco lobby in action) and do drugs, the choreographer, of course, is a sex addict that preys on the vulnerability of his young dancers, and the rest of the them, which are the other dancers, seem to be poised to stab each and everyone in the back so that they can get the most coveted part in the production. They are all very inspiring, I guess.The end of TBS, of course, is very cliché (as is the whole film...) because, as expected, what matters in the end is the performance, the perfection of execution and all that stupid bla-bla-bla about winning and succeeding at any cost.To spike the interest in and keep the attention of the male audience watching this 'masterpiece' , the producers resorted to an old trick and introduced two gratuitous sex scenes (one of them depicting lesbian sex) in the film. So, in the end we have a film with unpleasant characters, a weak script, and a story which could have been told in 15 minutes.Well, it seems 'Black Swan' is the perfect Oscar contender...",1,67,118,13 February 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes it ain't
","They could call the main character in this film John Archibald, Peter Smith, Vera Gardner, or whatever because it makes no differenceHe simply has no resemblance whatsoever with Doyle's creation. Those things should not be allowed. It is like painting mustaches on Mona Lisa or adding another leg to Michelangelo's David.What we have here is a guy, a 'thing' who is a mixture of a buffoon with an adult with ADD (nothing against the folks with ADD!!!). He is not a hero, nor anti-hero, he is just a messy individual.And to make things worse, the story is not that interesting. It has a feel of deja-vu. It is an effortless to capitalize on the success of the first film...Too bad they don't make Sherlock Holmes like before...",1,43,91,15 April 2012
The Equalizer," I miss Arnie...
","This is one of the dumbest films I've watched this year.Danzel seems to be one of those actors who accept any role as long as the pay check is decent.'The Equalizer' is your typical, run-of-the-mill, full-of-clichés vengeance film. A super-ultra black-ops or whatever comes out of retirement to rescue a young prostitute with a heart of gold.The point is that the films is a succession of a violent scenes, and a hero who is as convincing as snow in July in LA.No plot, or better, plot holes the size of Texas, the whole things become tedious pretty fast.At least, Schwarzenegger's films had some humor, they were dumb, but were fun to watch.This one is another waste of time...",1,53,113,13 December 2014
Source Code," Sore code? Sour code?
","As someone else said, 'Source Code ' is not sci-fi, but BS-fi...This is one of those movies which relies on some cinematographic confusion to give the not-so-smart viewer the impression that he is really smart because he could solve an 'intricate' and 'complex' case involving some technobabble, pseudo-science and an unexpected twist at the end of the story.These flash-backs, flash-forward get tiring after a while. Not to mention the fact that according to Hollywood all terrorists and modern evil-doers are white, blue-eyed folks is also getting a little repetitive (watching these movies one has the impression that Al Qaeda, for instance, consists of white, straight, Christian, patriotic, American men...).I would rather wait until they show it on TV, going to a movie theater is a waste of time and money.",2,3,8,12 June 2011
John Wick," Fun as hell
","It has been a while I watched a film where the hero (or anti-hero) was not some kind of effeminate anti-white politically correct dumb guy.John Wick is fun because in it we can see the essence of the Real White America Men.John Wick is a guy who is not afraid to go the utmost consequences for what he wants.He does things with his own hands and the only help he gets is based on honer and friendshipYes, it is a revenge film, and as unreal as the easter bunny, as thousands have been made before. But John Wick has spirit and is not watered down politically correct social commentary. They even kill a chick in it!!It is a great white guy film.",10,10,26,13 January 2015
World War Z," It is dejá vu all over again....
","Derivative and boring. Those are the two words that came to my mind after watching WWZ.The only good thing in this mindless (as a zombie...) film is Mr. Brad Pitt, who does a convincing acting job. Other than that, WWZ is a reheat of countless other films that rely on the same formula.Lame special effects, plot holes the size of Gibraltar,e.g., zombies do not attack 'sick' people.... This is in my opinion a Deus-ex-machina solution the writers used shamelessly...I wonder where they spend the millions and millions of dollars they use to make those films. I guess it is not in the script!",1,7,14,3 September 2013
Ted," In the Age of Stupid,
","a potty-mouthed bear is the pinnacle of funny!This is a pretty lousy bromance film. The only difference is that one of the friends has been substituted by a talking teddy bear. This could have some interesting and funny consequence, but the bear just behaves like a regular idiotic person... I guess people nowadays consider funny a teddy bear talking dirty, humping humans smoking pot and get wasted...I could not smile once during this whole tragedy... And the worst thing, is that the film wants to be more than it should be and teach most of us men that we should not be immature and should face the responsibilities of life such as getting married and having a family, because this is what makes us happy. Blah!!!!!Pirate it! It is not worth the price of a ticket or rental!",1,47,92,9 November 2012
"I Love You, Man"," Are people like that?
","Is this a comedy with an agenda? Are families and people like that? If this is true, society is really decadent.This movie is an attack to the senses and good taste. More than a romantic comedy, ILYM is a way to push on us a porno/gay lifestyle.Do girls talk freely and publicly about oral sex with all their friends? Does a father proudly embraces the gay lifestyle of a son and comment on the sex activities of this son at a dinner table? Do people use the word f**** all the time? Are all hetero men attracted to gay men?Do we have to be bombarded by these things all the time? Can't people do a clean comedy anymore? I felt embarrassed to watch this movie in the presence of my girlfriend... And, by the way, it is a dull movie. The comedy is not really there,ILYM is silly, formulaic and derivative. 'Paul Blart, Mall Cop' is a masterpiece compared with this clunker.",1,19,41,8 August 2009
Shutter Island," Like the lighthouse....
","...one can see the twist in the story miles away.SI is slow boring and not as smart as some of the reviewers think it it is. This film is one more of those films that question sanity and whose main character (in this case Leonardo di Caprio) is found to be living in an alternate reality. A person with half a brain would have seen that after the first 15 minutes. Well, all SI does is to jump back and forth from 'the realities' experienced by Di Caprio's character at the beat of a dreadful and annoying musical score (it gave me a head ache...). To make things worse it ends in an ambiguous way, another gimmick to make the viewer question his own reality... not very original.SI tries hard to be a horror movie, to create an eerie atmosphere, to involve the spectator with a mystery and a drama that simply are not there. It fails poorly.SI is another example that Hollywood has run out of original ideas.",1,37,80,19 March 2010
Interstellar," Tepid, at best
","Oh my...Another 'Science Fiction' film made by those geniuses who never took a science class in life.Interstellar, is a boring slow, plodding condescending type of film that thinks is much more smart than it realty is.Cant't just people go and explore three planets without this melodramatic nonsense? Wouldn't it be much better if all this humanist approach was discarded in favor of a story based on the true adventure of traveling through a wormhole?If people want drama there are a huge number of other (much better) films. If I want to feel bad I will watch Schindler's list... If I want some good Science Fiction I will watch Aliens. Is it that hard for people to get it?This was supposed to be a science fiction adventure, for god's sake. Why do these genius have to butcher what could have been a great film with all this over-bloated sentimentalism, this sacchariny mess? This is yet another proof that the masses are brain dead. They laud anything that is over complicated, with mindless twists, with some sort of stupid revelation as the work of a genius.Interstellar is another extremely over rated film. It rivals Prometheus in stupidity!I'd rather shoot a nail through my foot than ever watching it again...",1,69,151,21 January 2015
Fargo," I just don't understand it...
","says the main character of the film. Well, the same for me.Is this a comedy, a black comedy? People being shot, grounded, murdered? Is it funny? Do people laugh at thing like those?I always thought a comedy was about light entertainment, smiles and an occasional laughter. But, in Fargo from the very beginning till the very end there is no funny moments or situations... It is ugly, Fargo is a dark story with no happy ending.It is extremely overrated. If you fall for the mindless hype, and follow those raving movie critics Fargo is the movie for you. If you are a sensible person may be you should watch and try and understand what is happening to the world.",2,1,11,29 April 2009
Oblivion," Tepid science fiction...
","It could be better, but it could be worse.The pros in the film are the gorgeous visuals, Tom Cruise acting and the overall pace of the story and the absence of annoying pyrotechnics, needless explosions and battles, gratuitous sex, social commentaries, racial undertones, big and evil corporation which have become way too common in science fiction films lately...The cons is the generic, derivative and predictable plot (one can see what is happening 1/3 into the film) the awful Olga Kurylenko, who cannot act and does not even qualify as 'eye-candy', the miscasting of Morgan Freeman who looks out-of-place and somewhat ridiculous with the costume he had to wear( but hey, they needed an African-American actor, otherwise the film would be considered racist)Too bad, the director, script writers decided to play safe and did not try to be bolder. Oblivion could be a classic, instead it is an enjoyable but forgettable film.",1,11,24,24 July 2013
Split," Another case of 'Emperor's New Clothes' all over again
","I've said that many times that anything, any film that is presented as a 'convoluted', 'complicated', 'complex' story or plot will make the majority of audiences and critics to laud it as something good.'Split' is another example of this type of behavior/reasoning.But in reality the whole thing is idiotic, the story has plot holes the size of Texas (e.g. the three girls could easily subdue the child personality), the child molestation subplot is totally unnecessary, the whole DID gets old very fast, and the twist (yes, there is a twist, since this is is a Shyamalan film) only works for those who watched another film released in 2000!Waste of time and waste of money...",1,96,233,26 March 2017
Knowing," Knowing......and forgetting!
","Well, I guess that would be a much better name for it!The kind of formula they use in this silly movie has been used ad nauseam by Hollywood and its 'geniuses'. And they still insist using it. The only reason, I think, that they still use it is because they do not have ideas anymore, nothing original, no interesting concepts, nada, zero!Secret messages coded in a form that only a few understand, impending doom, mysticism, messages from outer space, messages from God himself, and whatever... Who cares? If there are beings out there who want to save the human race why don't they use a somewhat direct means of communicating with us? Why use the dates of disasters? Pretty silly stuff! This is a mix of the Da Vinci Code (another silly movie) with ET!",1,3,6,21 June 2009
Divergent," An idiotic book...
","...made into a pretty stupid film!Where authors(sic) get these unbelievably lame ideas? A world divided into 5 factions? This is ridiculous. This is another politically correct tripe. The plot is based on countless Hollywoodian stereotypes. Actors all look like they came out of catwalk fashion show. They have as much substance and personality as bobble head dolls. The film is tedious, move at a snail's pace and do not even fall into the category 'so bad it is good'It is embarrassing to know that there are those who classify this sophomoric attempt at literature as a dystopian science fiction novel.Pure waste of time, money.",1,357,674,22 July 2014
Ender's Game," Boot camp for nerds!
","This is one of those coma-inducing films. As tedious as watching C-Span...People should stop calling this garbage science fiction. What we have in this film is a bunch of boring kids trying to survive some sort of military school or a futuristic boot camp. They sprinkle the garbage with some special effects, a little of technobabble, some run-of-the-mill evil alien monsters, add heavy weight actors such as Ford and Kingsley and wrap the final product with a juvenile love story and, bang, we have Ender's Game.This a story that has been told million of times before (the superation, the fish out-of-water, the leader in the making, etc.), in different settings, eras, countries, etc... There is nothing new here. It is another eye-candy type of film that is totally forgettable.It was not worth the price of the admission ticket",1,8,18,28 January 2014
Face_Off," Boring...
","Oh boy! This is dumb beyond belief. Face transplants, magnetic prisons, endless sequences of non-stop fighting and shooting where everybody gets a bullet but the main characters.... It is mind numbing.The film is too long, too sugary. The end is ridiculous. The dysfunctional family becomes a happy one again, Oh, so sweet!Travolta and Cage either overact or underact, there is never a balance, and no much chemistry between them.And a story based on revenge ('he killed my son....') has been told billions of times before. A big wast of time!",2,1,4,27 February 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man," Adds nothing...
","It seems that we live in the era of useless remakes...And these remakes are a clear demonstration of the total lack of creativity and originality that has been plagued major (more expensive) cinematographic endeavors. They cannot come up with any interesting characters and stories, and to play safe they insist on remaking (poorly by the way)film after film.Why another Spiderman? Aren't there tons of superheroes that are as or more interesting than Spiderman? Why the same old story where uncles, friend, etc. die? These guys are clearly betting (and winning) on the dumbing-down of the average movie-goer. All they need is to come up with some decent CGI, 3D effects and a watered-down story to satisfy the masses.In an era when Prometheus is considered a masterpiece (sic) by some, Spiderman (1, 2, 3,...3578) will certainly find an eager audience.",Null,9,19,20 October 2012
Non-Stop," A politically correct action movie???
",Gimme a break!This is getting totally out of control. A good Muslin in a plane hijacked by a victim of 9/11? So the Muslim is a good doctor who help victims in the plane while the hijacker who seems to be a combat veteran is fed up with the American-way-of-life and decides to take revenge on the system...Those geniuses of Hollywood are getting better by the day. This is stupid beyond belief... What next? A movie where Jesus is a pedophile? A transvestite action hero who kills white people while wearing stilettos?,1,13,29,28 May 2014
Prisoners," Violence, torture porn
","The ratings seemed to indicate that this was a good film... So I decided to watch it.Oh, boy! I was wrong, wrong, wrong! First, and foremost: Why people make these depressing sad and utterly unpleasant films? What is the point? Don't we know already that humans can commit the most vile things? Aren't we bombarded constantly with images showing evil humans everyday in the daily news? Second,why the graphic depiction of violence? What is the purpose? It does not make sense? I did not have the stomach to endure it... I would not recommend it, except for sadist,morbid people that think that watch people suffer is entertaining.",1,11,38,13 November 2013
Elysium," Eye Candy and Nothing More
","Another of those films heavy on social commentary and lacking original ideas.If they have changed the name of Elysium to Sherwood, and of Max da Costa to Robin Hood, we would have a story that has been told many times before.The problem with Elysium and films like it is that they always side with the masses that procreate like rats instead of offering a better alternative to procreation without responsibility.The world's problems are not caused only by greed but also stupidity of the masses that insist on behaving on the same way as always.The only thing missing in the film is a hero that is also fundamentalist Muslim, to make it politically correct.A stupid film with some nice special effects...",1,28,46,11 November 2013
Don't Breathe," Dumb and dumber against a blind man
","A rating higher than 2 for a film like this one either means that a) The average IQ of the population dropped below 70 b) The review are fake or submitted by family members of the people involved with this piece of junk.In which planet, dimension, galaxy three healthy individuals are overpowered by one blind guy?And the girl in the basement subplot was an imbecilic attempt of padding the film with extra violence porn. The whole film is a succession of stupider and stupider decisions by the main protagonists, that is all there is to it.It is disappointing to realize what passes as entertainment these days...",1,91,182,15 October 2016
Sicario," Politically correct tripe
","Here we go again....A flimsy dove-eyed woman, the kind of woman one finds in a library or selling cookies in a PTA drive is part of extraction team of a FBI unit...yeah right!And to make things worse, while embedded with a CIA black-ops squad, this character start to show idiotic ideals of what is right and wrong when fighting brutal drug-lords, getting herself in a situation to mess up a big operation to kill the bad guys, trying to arrest the good guys...That is ridiculous.The CIA guys should have shot her on the spot, count her death as a casualty and move on.A film that could have become a classic was spoiled by this idiocy of people trying to force on us the idea that women are prepared for this type of action, which they are not.",1,62,137,20 December 2015
War of the Worlds," War of the Teenagers
","Ah! Only a genius would be able to transform a tale of invasion by aliens into a family drama, and that is what Spielberg did with The War of the Worlds. WOTW has nice special effects but everything else is major wreck.None of the characters in the movie is sympathetic, one does no feel the need to root for them. In fact after a while, I was hoping that they would be destroyed by the Martians. The whole story revolves around a divorced father and his two teenager kids, who were one of the most obnoxious children I've seen in movies. They are nothing more than two spoiled idiots that instead of shutting up and following simple orders kept on nagging, complaining and having tantrums... If they were my kids I would have given them to the Martians.So, instead of showing aliens, battles against an alien invader, we are given a pretty tedious family drama.The original made more than 50 years ago,as usual, was better than this 'family-oriented' politically-correct version of the 'The War of the Worlds'",1,2,5,22 March 2010
The Wrestler," Fascinating....
","I find fascinating what people think it is fascinating....Well, let's start with the positives. TW seems to be an interesting semi documentary about PART of the lives of pro-wrestlers; the depiction of fights in community centers for half-a-dozen spectators, just to make a few dollars must be very depressing and one really feel sorry for their lot. It is even possible to feel sympathy for the character played by Rourke, and that's all about it.On the other hand, everything else in this movie has already been told countless times before. So, why is people raving about it? I really do not know. TW is about a guy down on his luck, no family, living in a trailer park, that has (it seems) a good heart trying his best to survive on a changing world, I guy that has seen better days.... Seems original? I don't think so.Maria Tomei plays a stripper and that is all she does in TW; she shows her boobs and butt, nothing more, nothing less. Pretty cheap stuff. Her character adds nothing to the story.Without the nudity and one sex scene, TW would be like one of these cheap movies they show in the Lifetime channel. TW should be called 'The Cliché''. One even can foresee the climatic end of the movie.",3,9,18,13 April 2009
Arrival," Eye candy
","Here we go again...Arrival is another cliché-ridden, over-sentimental pseudo-science- fiction story with that ad-nauseam message that the world, humanity needs to works as one or else.Arrival joins ranks with pseudo-science-fiction bombs such as Interstellar and Prometheus which are films that substitute true adventure, discovery with this idiotic humanist, intimist, sentimental, psychological-whatever drivel. And curiously, one of the main characters behaves in the same mindless way as a character in Prometheus and removes her protective gear so that the aliens could see her better....It seems stupidity is contagious.For god's sake, aliens are contacting humanity for the first time and all the directors and script writers have to show is this sugary syrup of a story? And the twist (yes, of course, there is a twist) is mind- boggling stupid. Writers had a nice concept, but did not know how to develop it nor how to close the story in an intelligent way. Arrival is another dumb story packaged with an interesting photography.It is 100% eye candy and nothing else.",1,401,867,8 November 2016
Prometheus," Science Fiction it ain't
","I guess Prometheus should be renamed. A more appropriate name would be 'The Marx Brothers Go Camping in an Alien World' or 'Exobiology with the Three Stooges'I never understood why Hollywood insists on doing Science Fiction movies with total disregard for science and scientists.Hollywood writers are dumb, politically correct motivated, and so anti- science that they could not figure out what science and scientists are all about. They always use those stereotyped idiots.A film that could be so much better end up looking like those slasher teen movies where a bunch of retards are, for instance, trapped in a haunted mansion or are chased by a demented killer.To make thinks worse, Prometheus is rip-off of a much better movie (characters and story wise): Alien Versus Predator... The idea of an old very rich dying guy assembling a team of experts is nothing original..Prometheus is eye candy, nothing more than that...",1,7,15,13 September 2012
Wonder Woman," Conan with PMS
","Wow!What a wreck.... WW has nice visuals, but that was about it.The whole film is slow, the intro on the 'magic island' is coma inducing, the solemnity of the dialogue could cause paralysis better than any curare dart, the musical score was uninspired as though it was composed 'on automatic' by whoever composed it. And the Amazons were as convincing as a bunch of Victoria Secret's models trying to beat bare handedly a team of elite SEALS. And they even tried to speak with a lower voice, which was ridiculous.The main actress is stiff, with no charisma, C. Pine and the guys playing Germans were way better than her. And the villain was as scary as the Easter Bunny on a bad hair day.Summarizing, WW is as dull as ditch water. There is nothing here, maybe only for the PC crowd.",1,4,18,1 July 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," Another one for the non-thinking masses....
","Overlong, talky and boring.....And who had the idea of having a villain with a art-deco ashtray on his mouth? Bane is one of the most poorly developed villains in history. What were they thinking? What is the point of hiding is face and facial expressions?The dialog is painful, tedious. The film is overlong, bloated, they tried to pack too much into it and the result is very confusing. Anne Hathaway in unconvincingly flimsy looking. Not to mention she has no charisma, chemistry with Batman.Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine (the coolest characters) are given minimal screen time.I rather watch Adam West's Batman. At least it was fun.",1,41,79,16 November 2012
Flight," Flight Flies like A Chicken
","Well, what can one expect of a film of which the best moment is a gratuitous nude scene right at the beginning of the film?That was the only 'redeeming' thing in the film. I had to set my standards pretty low to find anything remotely interesting in this airplane wreck....Other than that what, we see is the usual parade of junkies, low-lives, booze and drug use and the usual and expected love-interest, dysfunctional family and redemption of the main character in the film.I believe that looking at pictures in the internet of meth addicts would be more enlightening.",1,13,29,31 January 2013
Looper," Blah!
","Pseudo-intellectual film for the non-thinking masses...As unattainable as time travel itself are films about time travel....Usually, they are full of inconsistencies, plot holes and whatever. The climax scene at the end of the film is a good example of how people do not know how to end a film and then come up with some 'smart twist' which of course destroyed the whole logic of the story...It has been a while since I watched a decent science fiction, Looper is another mess, similar to Prometheus. But at least Prometheus had some eye candy, some nice special effects, Looper has a dry sugar cane field...",1,35,72,15 November 2012
Life," Rooting for the 'Evil Space Chewing Gum'
","Life is yet another pseudo, post-modern politically correct scifi from the ignoramuses from Hollywood. Its appalling stupidity rivals that of Prometheus and Covenant.As usual we have a parade of dumb, shallow characters, 'scientist' with an IQ lower than an amoeba's doing stupider and stupider things in succession, from using their fingers to play with an alien creature ( a biologist did the same in Prometheus...), to opening containment areas to retrieve infected crew members, and so on. And the scientist are all 'Doctors', who probably got their PhD from some correspondence school.Besides these and many other things the film is slow, tedious, full of idiotic stupid clichés and with a dialogue that is for the mot part an abomination.They tried to make another 'Alien', instead what they made is the 'Attack of the Evil Space Chewing Gum'.Even the 'The Blob', filmed more than 50 years ago is better than 'Life'.",1,144,307,3 June 2017
Get Him to the Greek," Thanks God there is a Fast Forward Button!
","Appalling!This is the only word I can use to describe this 'film'THTTG is advertised as a comedy, but watching it was a very depressing experience. Sometimes, I have the impression that I as born in another planet in a far away galaxy because I cannot understand what passes as comedy these days. There are no funny moments in the film, the characters are all losers with no redeeming qualities and after a while one does not care about them any more. There is no sympathy nor empathy for these guys. A movie lacking a smart and funny script such as THTTG resorts to bathroom 'jokes' and raunchiness, etc. to keep peoples' attentions. And that is all this film is all about. A succession of depressing examples of lowbrow humor and situations involving bodily functions...Can't those guys come up with something a little more creative than vomiting, dildos, situations involving one's lower parts of the digestive tract? What next? What is going to be the next great idea of these guys to 'entertain' the audiences: a graphic display of diarrhea, a person with cholera? Who nows...For me this was the last time I'ever watch one of these post-modern comedies.",1,37,78,20 September 2010
Cloud Atlas," Murky Atlas
","Wow....what a train wreck!This is one of these self-indulgent, snobbish, pseudo-intellectual, monotonous, confusing, boring, disjointed, disconnected films for the 'thinking' masses.Nowadays, anything that is hard to follow, is a migraine-inducing experience, has no meaning whatsoever, is more tedious than watching a dripping faucet is considered a high form of cinematographic experience. But for me, it was an ordeal to follow these stories till the end, after a while I did not care anymore for what was happening...Instead, I was counting the minutes till the end of this mess.Like a cloud, it is beautiful to look at, and like a cloud, it has no substance.",Null,1,6,24 December 2012
Easy A," Stereotypical, bigoted pseudo-comedy
","What can one expect of a film, which is supposed to be a comedy, that resorts to situations like:1)A promiscuous school counselor, 2) A chlamydia-infected Christian teenager, 3) A closeted gay, 4) 'Modern' parents: the mother was a self-confessed slut, the father an ex-gay (sic). 5) An overly fanatical Christian girl, 6) A not-so-trusty pastor, 7)A 'disgusting' fat boy, 8) etc.Well, first of all, this type of movie shows that those Hollywood geniuses are big cowards. They only have the guts to attack certain groups of people, e.g. Christians. Funny thing is that they do not have the guts to ridicule other religions. I wonder what would happen if they portrayed Muslims or black evangelicals like they portray white Christians in films. OK, I know movies do not represent real situations and it is OK to exaggerate. But do everything needs to be about sex? All the time? Can't they think about anything that does not involve sex? Can't they come up with a funny situation that does not involve some sort of toilette humor or sex?Is it OK to be a 'deviant'? That what these movies show all the time.Not even Mark Twain is left alone. They always put forward this idea that for one to be happy one needs to have some sort of 'peculiar' sexual behavior, like the pseudo-liberal post-modern parents of the main character. Without Emma Stone (the only positive in this film) Easy A would have flunked catastrophically , because of her it deserved a D-...",2,23,41,22 November 2010
Mad Max: Fury Road," A quasi-politically correct mess
","Nice action sequences, explosions, lots of noise, bombastic score, car flips, truck chases and nothing else. It it had at least some boobage, I would've given it 3 stars.Well, MMFR is another of these politically correct post-modern allegories that show that men are evil and that all world's problems are caused by them and that women in the end will save the day and bla, bla, bla...This thing is so dumb that whoever wrote this mess even invented super grannies who can shoot and kill and are as though as any 300 lb NFL OL.And the most interesting aspect of MMFR is that is has no story, no plot whatsoever. It is nothing more than an endless car chase through a desert, they do not even know which is their final destination!!. Is is true that the scenery is awesome, but we have National Geographic to produce this type of material, right?And in the end, as expected 'Prince Charming' saves the day and a retinue of damsels in distress, as expected. And the aforementioned damsels and other damsels reclaim the world as theirs to right all wrongs men ever have made..Those remakes are so bad that I guess someday someone will have the bright idea of remaking Rambo as a gay transvestite....",1,15,34,22 August 2015
