Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," mainly fantastic, but...
","Having just come back from seeing Episode One, I feel i have just seen a brilliant fantasy. The story is a great introduction to the saga and fills in gaps, as well as leaving you wanting more. There were some faults I feel. having an almost freakish obsession with Darth Maul, I feel he was in the film for too short a time and that his part was not used enough. I am disappointed he will not be in the next film, although I can understand why. I did hate Jar Jar Binks. He was irritating and unnecessary, a very bad second to Chewbacca, But hey, we can't have everything.
if you haven't seen it yet, prepare to be entertained and enjoy the ride!",9,7,9,18 July 1999
