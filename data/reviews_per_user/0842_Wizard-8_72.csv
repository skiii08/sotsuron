The Benchwarmers," Another loser from Revolution Studios
","When I first heard about 'The Benchwarmers', I'll admit part of me was attracted to the premise of the movie. As a child, I was very unathletic, and as a result all too well about not fitting in because of that and the wish to get respect from my peers. Maybe, I thought, they could pull this off.However, the execution of the premise was a complete failure. The first problem I had was with the depiction of the protagonists. They are more than nerds - they are REPULSIVE nerds. They seem to all be intentionally acting in the most annoying ways they can be. As a result, I had no sympathy for them.The second problem I had with the movie was the frequent attempts at mining humor from such things as urine, flatulence, spit, and vomit. Hey, I'm no prude - I watch R-rated and unrated movies all the time and enjoy them. But the way this material is written and directed, it is simply disgusting and with no humor at all.This movie actually did decent business when it was released. Maybe there are more of us nerds out there than I thought. But I'm pretty sure they were turned off this movie as much as I was, and won't want to see it a second time.",Null,0,1,12 January 2010
Howl's Moving Castle," Fine animated movie, though not perfect
","I'm not sure why it took me so long to finally sit down and watch 'Howl's Moving Castle'. Maybe the almost two hour running time discouraged me. Maybe also for the fact that Roger Ebert gave it a negative review. But I'm glad I finally watched it. There is stuff in this movie I have NEVER seen before. And the storyline kept giving new twists so that I was never sure where the movie was going.I will admit the movie is not perfect. The almost two hour running time, and the fact that there is a substantial amount of stuff that could be called 'padding' are liabilities. I think the movie would have been better if it were shorter, with scenes tightened. Another problem I had was that some of the questions that came up in the movie were never answered.Still, overall, this is a movie worth seeing for adult viewers. What about children? Well, I think they could like it, but I recommend that they first see Miyazaki's KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE and MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO first to warm them up to Miyazaki's style. Then afterwards, when they sit down to watch this, plan the occasional break when you press pause on your remote. If you don't do this, your kids may get overwhelmed as well as impatient.",Null,0,1,24 July 2009
The Monuments Men," Goes too far in its intended direction
","One review that I read before watching 'The Monuments Men' stated that it was an old-fashioned type of movie. After seeing it, I tend to agree with that statement. It takes its subject matter very seriously for the most part, and instead of being lightening fast like most modern Hollywood movies, the pace is slow and deliberate. Nothing wrong with that in theory, but writer/director/actor George Clooney doesn't quite manage to pull it off. The movie is so solemn and serious that it almost becomes boring many times through its almost two hour running time. Some action or a few more attempts at humor would have helped. The subject matter is worthy of a movie, and the recreation of the time and place does come across as authentic, but I see that most people will probably squirm in their seats from a lack of patience with the end results.",Null,0,1,17 July 2015
Sucker Punch," Great visuals... not so great script
","First of all, I will freely admit that SUCKER PUNCH looks great. There is a seamless mix between physical sets and computer animation, and both combined manage to give us various worlds that look spectacular and unlike anything you have seen before.Unfortunately, I don't have as much enthusiasm for the screenplay. For starters, there is barely a story here - most of the movie consists of the female protagonists looking for stuff on a list. And the characters aren't that well-written as well. All of the female protagonists pretty much come across as all the same, with only their physical looks differentiating them from each other. Scott Glenn, an actor I've admired in the past, is pretty much wasted here.While I wouldn't call this a TERRIBLE movie, I do think it's kind of disappointing. If the movie had a richer story and richer characters, it would almost certainly have become an instant cult classic. As it is now, there's no compelling reason to seek it out. If you do watch it, pick a time when your expectations are not high and you are in the mood for visual candy.",Null,2,4,20 August 2011
10 Cloverfield Lane," Pretty good... up to the final 10 or so minutes
","When you set the majority of your movie in one basic location, more often than not you have your work cut out for you. So credit needs to go to all the participants who worked on '10 Cloverfield Lane' for making the movie very compelling... up to the finale. Before I get to that finale, a few words on the best things about the movie. The acting is very good, particularly by the underrated John Goodman. Goodman and the other actors are fortunate to have roles that are written to be much smarter than usual; even the character that turns out to have a dark background is not stupid - which makes him scarier. And while most of the movie takes place in one basic location, the writers manage surprisingly to unfold new challenges and plot turns on a regular basis. It certainly never gets boring.The only real misstep of the movie is with the final few minutes. The video store clerk warned me of this ending by telling me that the end was 'weird', and after watching it I have to agree with her to a degree. It doesn't really fit the down to earth and believable attitude the movie had up to that point. I know with a modern day movie like this that the audience expects some 'big' twist at the end, but for me it didn't seem right. The business with the Molotov cocktail made things really unbelievable. I guess the movie is still worth seeing, but the misguided ending prevents the movie from being a minor classic and downgrades it to being merely entertaining.",Null,1,4,29 June 2016
The Finest Hours," A bit too predictable for its own good
","'The Finest Hours' is in some ways one of the most unusual movies to be released by the Disney studio under its Disney brand. That's because the movie seems to be more aimed at adults rather than family audiences. Certainly, the movie is free of foul language, real violence, and sexual material. But virtually all the characters are adults, and the story itself is a pretty sober one without any real gimmicks. While those fact make the movie interesting at first, eventually some flaws start to come in. Though based on a true story, the scripted events that happen from start to finish come across as pretty predictable. And under the direction of Craig Gillespie, you don't really get the feeling that the characters are in serious danger; the peril instead comes across as somewhat soft. This is not a BAD movie, but it simply does not make itself especially exceptional or captivating.",Null,1,2,6 February 2017
The Equalizer," Predictable but watchable
","I am not sure why the makers of this movie bothered to get the rights to do a movie version of a television series when the movie has very little of the elements that were found in the television series. I guess the most plausible reason would be that being an official movie adaptation of a television series, the movie would have instant 'branding' and make it easier to market than a movie with a more original plot line and characters. Anyway, the story and characters in this movie are for the most part nothing you haven't seen before either on television or in other movies. You'll be pretty much able to predict what happens before it actually does. On the other hand, these predictable elements are put forward in a professional manner. Washington does well playing someone with a dark past who is still good at his game, the action scenes are brutal and fairly exciting, and the movie as a whole looks very nice. So I'm giving this movie a cautionary recommendation. If you are looking for something new, look elsewhere. But if you don't mind seeing the same plot and characters all over again, you'll find this movie a well crafted retread.",Null,9,13,10 June 2015
Child 44," It's not a bad movie, but it's not great as well
","I was surprised to find the major Hollywood studio movie 'Child 44' in the Blu-ray section at my local library, because I hadn't even heard of it before. Doing some pre-viewing research, I discovered that the studio more or less threw the movie away, giving it a small and not well publicized theatrical release. When this kind of thing happens, it usually means the studio feels it has a turkey on its hands and they are cutting their losses. Actually, the movie is some distance from being branded as terrible. The look and feel of the movie, replicating the Stalin-lead Soviet Union is spot on. Insights into how the oppressive government at the time worked are often interesting, helping to make the movie not be boring. The acting is also very good as well. However, the movie also has some major problems. Although the movie is not boring, it's all the same WAY stretched out. It's often rambling about unnecessary details, and reluctant to focus on the heart of the movie, and the movie ends up being much too long (over two hours in length!) Also, the sequence you'll be long waiting for - the climatic confrontation with the killer - ends up being a real letdown. As I said, the movie is not awful, but it is also not satisfying enough. The problems I listed, along with the fact that Americans often don't seem that interested in movies with a strong 'foreign' element to them, probably explain why the studio was reluctant to put in the expense and work necessary to give it a wider release.",Null,0,1,27 February 2016
Deepwater Horizon," Made with good intentions, but doesn't really work
","Although what I stated in my above summary line may make you think that I thought that 'Deepwater Horizon' was a bad movie, that is actually not the case. It's more of a misguided movie instead. The movie can be basically divided into two halves, and each half doesn't really work.The first half suffers from the fact that it is way too long and talky. Yes, some time should have been taken to set up the situation and try to educate the audience what is going on, but I don't think it had to be to the extent (about fifty minutes) that the movie thinks it had to run. As a result, it's often quite boring. The second half of the movie (when the disaster starts) is a bit better - there is some excitement and suspense, though it suffers from the fact that a lot of the CGI special effects are not really all that convincing. Also, it ends a bit abruptly in some regards before the closing credits start to roll.I think the movie may have worked better if its 107 minutes were divided into three equal length parts - the first part setting up the situation, the second part devoted to the unfolding disaster, and then a final part showing the characters adjusting after the disaster. But as it is, the movie is kind of misguided. As I said, it's not an awful movie - there is some genuine merit here and there, like some good acting and sympathetic characters - but the whole package is somewhat unsatisfying.",Null,11,18,20 May 2017
It," Wrong tone sinks this
","I saw the original two part made for television movie 'It' when it was first broadcast in 1990, and I enjoyed it very much. I then subsequently read the original Stephen King novel the movie was based on, and not only did I enjoy it as well, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the television movie stuck to what happened in the novel for the most part. When this 2017 theatrical remake came out, I was a little hesitant to watch it, in part because it was already done very well back in 1990, and this remake announced it was updating the time period. But when the movie came on Netflix, I decided to give it a look, seeing that it would be a free viewing.It did not take me long to realize that this remake was pretty much a failure. To sum up how this remake gets it wrong, I'll just say that it's too 'rock n roll' to work. The novel and the original 1990 movie were calmer, more subtle, and as a result were much more effective in building and sustaining horror. Also, this remake pretty much guts the original story to do its own thing. Maybe that was so it couldn't be compared to the original movie and make it be judged on its own merits. I can understand that, but what they do instead is hammer onto the audience over and over one 'jump scare' after another with what seems to be random horror images instead of one true menace. This got old REALLY fast, and I soon didn't care about the characters or what was happening. It's almost plotless.With the original novel still in print, and the original TV movie available on DVD and Blu-ray, there's no reason to seek out this remake. I strongly suspect King himself feels it's one of the lesser adaptations of his written works.",3,0,1,27 October 2019
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A very strange movie...
","'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' the novel was a best seller. 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' the movie didn't do especially well at the box office. I haven't read the book, but I suspect many people didn't warm to the movie adaptation was that a lot of times what works on the written page doesn't work on the big screen. As it is, a lot of the movie had me scratching my head. Was I supposed to laugh? Was I supposed to treat it as a horror movie? Or was I supposed to take the entire thing seriously? I honestly didn't know how to react to what I saw. The movie also suffers from uneven special effects - some look good, but others look way too computer generated instead of realistic. I can't honestly say I was bored by this movie, but more often than not it left me bewildered. If I had hadn't gotten the Blu-ray as a free rental, I suspect my opinion would have been more negative. So I suggest you wait until it plays on cable on a slow night.",Null,1,2,25 October 2012
John Wick," The action makes this worth a look
","I have to make a confession before getting into this movie - I normally can't stand Keanu Reeves. Apart from playing a likable goofball in the 'Bill & Ted' films and an okay performance in 'The Matrix', I don't think he's a particularly good actor. Which is the main reason why I avoided this movie when it played in theaters. I decided to give it a look after hearing several positive reviews of it and after finding a copy I could check out for free from my local library.After watching it, I am glad that I took a chance. For starters, Reeves gives an adequate performance. It certainly helps that he doesn't have a huge amount of dialogue, but what he is given he does deliver acceptably. However, he does a bravo job when it comes to the physical part of the role - he throws himself into the action, coming across both as a spectacular skilled foe while at the same time not coming across as outlandishly fancy - I could believe a man could be skilled enough to do everything he did. (It also helps that he gets wounded and hurt along the way, which prevents him from becoming unbelievably and annoyingly perfect.) While I'm on the subject of action, kudos has to also go to director Chad Stahelsk for staging it successfully again and again. The gun fights and martial arts are spectacular. Praise has to also go to him for keeping the movie moving speedily along without any boring bits despite there not being a terrible amount of plot... and for the fact that the little plot there is will be familiar to many viewers.I see they are making a sequel to this movie. If both Reeves and Stahelsk return, I'll definitely be seeing it.",Null,0,3,14 August 2015
Fury," Not a classic, but serviceable
","In some aspects, 'Fury' feels like an old fashioned war movie from several decades ago. The movie does dabble with character clichés that are right out of the golden age of Hollywood (the green recruit, the ethnic soldier, etc.) Though the war films from the golden age usually went into better depth with their characters; the characters here are somewhat thin. In its defense, the movie does make the interesting decision to not make all of its main characters completely likable; they all are shown to have some negative aspects. And while their constant swearing is a little annoying, I think that's how many soldiers in the battlefield talk. The movie is also more explicit than older war movies with its violence. There is some truly graphic violence here, but it's depicted in a way that shows that real warfare is not fun and games - it's serious business. I will admit that some of the tactics used by both sides in warfare in the movie are a little hard to swallow, but the battles are compelling all the same. And while the story suffers from the fact that it's basically a collection of (long) vignettes instead of one solid story, the movie is not boring despite lasting more than two hours. While I wouldn't say the movie is worth paying top dollar to see, it is worth a viewing under less expensive conditions, like when it comes on cable.",Null,1,2,12 June 2015
The Maze Runner," Oddly unsatisfying
","As I put it in my summary line above, there is something strangely unsatisfying about 'The Maze Runner'. I'm not saying that it is a BAD movie. The movie doesn't make the ultimate sin filmmakers can do, which is to make a movie boring. The special effects are pretty good, and the cast comes across as a talented number of youths. So what goes wrong with this movie? It's hard to say. It may be that the movie isn't totally original - there are elements of 'Cube', 'Welcome To Blood City', and other movies here. It may be that there are clear signs that the original cut of the movie ran a lot longer but was edited down to a more reasonable running time, since there are some minor plot elements that don't get enough explanation or none at all. It may be because while the end of the movie gives us some explanation as to what was going on, the ending is also leaves the audience hanging on some important details, no doubt to get people to come for the upcoming sequel. Whatever the reason(s) may be, the end results, while not terrible, are somewhat frustrating.",Null,0,0,29 July 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," An improvement over 'The Force Awakens'
","To a certain degree, I initially kind of enjoyed 'The Force Awakens' despite finding some significant flaws, the main one being that it had WAY WAY too many echoes of the original 1977 'Star Wars' movie. But the more I thought about it afterwards - and I thought about it a lot - I realized how unsatisfying it really was. So now my opinion of it is a definite thumbs-down. So I was not looking forward to 'Rogue One' when it came to my neighborhood, but I finally broke down and went to see it after getting a number of positive reports about it.I just got home from the theater, and my state of mind feels a lot more positive than what I got from 'T.F.A.'. It's definitely a stronger (and better) movie in a number of aspects. What I thought was really interesting about it was how kind of downbeat it was. It shows that war is really painful and not fun at all, and that good guys do get killed (though I didn't think it would be to the extent it was in the end.) But despite the strong cynical edge, there is also plenty of excitement and action, some fine special effects, and occasional (and welcome) touches of humor.The movie is not perfect, certainly. While I did appreciate the gritty and cynical feel of the movie, it unfortunately extends to the photography and the lighting for the most part. The movie is so dark-looking I would have welcomed any character bringing in a flashlight. Also, I was disappointed that Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen was largely wasted - I could see great potential in his character that was simply not realized. Speaking of the rest of the cast, the CGI-generated Grand Moff Tarkin, while not as bad-looking as some reports have put it, didn't look quite right. And Darth Vader in his appearance didn't seem to be acting quite like the Vader we know from the 1977 movie, acting a bit too lively with his words. The script also has some greatly predictable touches here and there.Weighing the good with the not-so-good, in the end you have a fairly decent 'Star Wars' entry. It's no classic, but it is a noble try and it does reasonably entertain. However, I cannot help but wonder if my opinion of the movie will change in the weeks to come like it did with 'T.F.A.'....",Null,6,12,21 December 2016
World War Z," Not awful, but all the same disappointing
","I am always up for a good zombie movie - emphasis on 'GOOD'. Most zombie movies I've seen have disappointed me, and 'World War Z' is other notch on that list.I haven't read the book the movie is based on, but I suspect it must have been a lot better than this. What went wrong? I'm not sure. Despite all the money that was thrown at this movie (including refilming the ending), the movie at times doesn't seem that expensive. Another problem is that the zombies themselves aren't explored closely. You never really get a sense of what they are like and what they can do. Why would they only bite people instead of eating them, like zombies in other movies? Well, that's probably because the movie stubbornly sticks to being at a PG-13 level. Yes, that's right - a zombie movie without that much blood and gore, which I know will annoy many horror fans.Well, I guess the movie isn't THAT bad, but it's a big disappointment. I should note that I saw the movie for free at a theater. If I had paid any money to see it, I strongly suspect my review would have been a lot more scathing.",Null,6,12,2 July 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Best watched in a forgiving mood
","I think I should explain my position towards the whole 'Star Trek' franchise before getting into this film. While I have (now) seen all the ST movies, I have actually seen very little of the various ST television shows. So I'm not quite an expert on ST. I have heard, however, that the TV shows were often cerebral to a degree, and I think that element is one thing that's missing with this particular ST movie. The movie often eschews a human element in order to bombard its audience with action and special effects. Now, the action AND the special effects are sometimes very good. But there are a number of times when something quite absurd and/or unbelievable happened that had me mentally groaning out loud at what I was witnessing. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see the movie. Let me state that despite these flaws, the movie isn't awful - it's not boring, and does pack in a reasonable amount of entertainment. But as I indicated in my summary line, it's probably best to hold off watching this movie until you are in an undemanding mood.",Null,2,4,2 August 2015
Hostel," Mostly boring and unsatisfying
","Before I get into criticizing this movie, I feel I should admit that I am human. I often enjoy seeing movies that involve sexual material, and I also often enjoy seeing movies that have a lot of blood and gore shed. This movie certainly has both of those ingredients, and in great quantity, but all the same the movie failed to interest me that much. You can't just put great gobs of nudity and bloody violence in a movie and expect it to therefore be instantly great. You have to put substance with it as well, and that is where 'Hostel' fails. For starters, the movie is very slow-moving - it takes forever for the protagonists to find themselves in trouble. And during that long period before the crisis starts, what we see of them is not exactly endearing - they come across as simple-minded sex-obsessed youths. While I'm speaking of the characters, the movie also fails when it comes to the antagonists - we learn almost nothing about them. As a result of that, there isn't a great feeling of danger to be felt. You'll just tiredly watch the mayhem and look at your watch to see how much time is remaining until the movie comes to an end. A real disappointment.",Null,1,2,7 October 2015
Green Room," Competent retelling of a reliable formula
","For some reason, the basic plot of 'Green Room' - innocent individuals finding themselves holed up in a confined space while a great menace is right outside trying to wipe them out - is one that I personally find both irresistible and open to be told in many different ways. It's been done from westerns ('3:10 to Yuma' and 'Rio Bravo') to horror movies ('Dog Soldiers'). Although 'Green Room' doesn't really try to bring in a new genre to this old reliable formula, it is a competent retelling overall. The bad guys are vicious and hateful, the good guys are pretty sympathetic, there is some effective brutal violence, it's never dull, and the movie looks pretty good for a low budget exercise.Are there any problems along the way? Yes, several, problems that I think hold back the movie from being great and instead make it simply good. One problem is that the movie takes quite a long time to really get going - half the movie, if I recall greatly. Also, the final confrontation with Patrick Stewart's character is kind of a letdown; I expected something a lot more charged up. But the movie, despite problems such as these, shouldn't discourage any viewers who enjoy this formula as much as I do.",Null,1,5,22 July 2016
The Babadook," Eerie horror film
","I knew next to nothing about this movie when I sat down to watch it, only knowing that it had received some serious raves from critics and audiences alike. After watching it, I do agree (for the most part) that the movie deserves the praise it has received. The horror sequences, the meat of the movie, are pretty spooky. Interestingly, however, a lot of the horror isn't your typical kind. What's often distressing is seeing Essie Davis' character slowly losing a grip on what would be considered a comfortable life. She loses sleep, her employment is threatened, and the child welfare authorities are called in, among other distressing happenings to this character. These parts of the movie are pretty well done as well as the straight horror parts of the movie, and combined make the movie an effectively uncomfortable watch at times.Some viewers may be disappointed that the Babadook's sudden entrance, various acts, and ultimate intent are not really explained. But that did not matter much to me - sometimes a horror that is unexplained can come across more frightening. If there is a real fault to be found in the movie, it would be that it feels a little long and drawn out at times. If it had been cut by ten to fifteen minutes, I think it would have run more smoothly. But if you are in a patient mood, the movie does have enough jolts and spooky situations to make it worth a look.",Null,2,4,13 August 2015
Point Break," Surprisingly boring
","'Point Break' was a substantial bomb when it was released in theaters, and it doesn't take long into watching it to figure out why audiences rejected it. Certainly it was hurt by its casting. It isn't just that the actors hired weren't big stars, but they are extremely unconvincing in their roles - Luke Bracey is one of the most unlikely FBI agents I have seen in a movie. The biggest problem I had with the movie is that it's really dull for the most part. Certainly the action sequences are flatly staged and directed, but the material that is between the action sequences should have also had some spark to keep the audience's attention. I will admit that there are a few cool visuals here and there, but their impact is somewhat diluted by the fact that the ENTIRE FILM is shot in murky and dark colors. This is one ugly looking movie. Stick with the original version - it's not a great movie, but it's more competently done than this remake.",Null,2,4,30 April 2016
Creed," Solid continuation of the series
","I did like the previous entry of this series ('Rocky Balboa'), though I did think that Sylvester Stallone had taken the series as far as it could go. But in this entry, thanks in part to new director and co- writer Ryan Coogler, we get some freshness and a new angle to look at. And the end results are pretty well done. Yes, there are some predictable elements in the movie that you'll be able to guess will happen a scene or two before they unfold. But as familiar as some parts of the movie may be, the movie at all times remains competently written and directed; each moments does play out in a convincing manner that you'll believe could happen in real life. The acting is solid by all the participants, particularly Michael B. Jordan and Stallone. The only real problem I had with the movie is that it does play out a little too long and stretched out - some slight tightening would have helped things. But even with that nitpick, the movie is still well worth seeing.",Null,0,1,11 June 2016
Moana," Okay, but too many cooks made some significant weaknesses
","I'm pretty sure most kids - and a lot of parents - will probably enjoy 'Moana' a lot. Technically, the movie is first rate, with animation that is very colorful, detailed, and breathtaking. There are some very good (and exciting) action sequences here and there. And many viewers will be taken by the title character, who is intelligent, brave, and resourceful.However, there are some major weakness in the entire package that significantly lower the movie from the label of modern day classic. For example, the script has some holes. For starters, if Moana has lived on a small island for many years, why doesn't she know about the chiefs monument on top of the mountain? Or know about the cave hidden by the waterfall? Another problem is that the movie, at 107 minutes in length, is much too long for its own good. While the movie never gets to be boring, the padding is very evident. And the songs, while not terrible, are not very memorable at all.As I indicated in my summary line, I think these weaknesses came from the fact that too many people were working in key roles - look at the fact that there were four directors, and even more people working on the story. If there had been one clear vision, maybe the aforementioned problems would have been reduced significantly. I'll give the movie this: It's a step up from the overrated Disney movie 'Frozen'. Maybe Disney is slowly improving.",Null,1,2,24 June 2017
Doctor Strange," Not awful... but feels by the numbers
","I must confess that before watching this movie, I had next to no prior knowledge of the comic book character Doctor Strange. So I don't know how closely this cinematic adaptation is to the source material. But I can confidently report that much of the movie plays out in a way that has elements that I have seen in many other movies before, superhero oriented or not. For example, the characters seem very familiar for the most part, such as a central protagonist who starts off selfish and arrogant but ultimately redeems himself. The villains are stereotypically flat, with no complex attributes or deep looks into their minds. And the central story's twists and turns will not be very surprising for most viewers. Oh, there are some good things here and there. The special effects are good at times, the action a few times is eye-catching, and the movie is never downright boring. But all the same, the movie feels kind of tired and lacks serious ability to give the audience something new and fresh. It's certainly better than watching a blank wall for two hourse, but not that much more. All this may explain why the movie, while definitely a worldwide box office success, wasn't a hit at the magnitude of some other Marvel superhero movies.",Null,0,1,11 June 2017
Barry Lyndon," Well worth a look
","I put off watching this movie for years, in part due to its length (over three hours long) and also in part because it came across to me as a laborious costume drama that didn't exactly scream interest or excitement. But I finally broke down and watched it today, and I am glad that I did. First, I feel I should tell people who may have been in my shoes that the movie is NOT boring. Although it follows the journey and adventures of one particular character, it is more or less told in a series of short vignettes. Told this way, the movie doesn't require viewers to keep a long mental note of who is who and what is happening - it is pretty easy to understand what is happening. And each vignette is interesting - some have a light comic touch, some are more serious, all are entertaining to watch. I kept asking myself, 'I wonder what will happen next to this fellow?', and my curiosity also helped to keep me captivated. What I also found interesting about this movie was how the title character is depicted. In the first half of the movie, although he does some shameful things, at the same time he is kind of sympathetic to the audience. But in the second half of the movie, after he has reached the top of society, he pretty much loses the sympathy he managed to generate. In another movie, this might have spoiled things. But the movie manages to keep us watching to see just how low he will fall. The narrator puts it best at one point when he says the tools the protagonist used to reach the top would also contribute to his downfall. At the end of the movie, I could see that was all well true.If you are still hesitant about watching this movie, give the first fifteen minutes a try, as I did when I still had some reluctance in investing three hours of my time. It didn't take me long to get hooked, and I'm pretty sure you'll quickly find yourself captivated as well.",Null,1,2,26 September 2015
Ant-Man," Best reserved for when you're in an undemanding mood
","I avoided 'Ant-Man' when it played in theaters for several reasons. One reason was that this particular superhero seemed minor league compared to most others. Another reason was that quite frankly, I am starting to get tired of superhero movies. There have been so many over the past few years that it's starting to get a bit too much.Anyway... I finally watched it today after finding a copy at my local library. And after watching it, I can say I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in a theater, and I'm glad I didn't have to pay to see it on Blu-ray. Before I go any further, I will admit that I didn't hate or really dislike it. There have been worse movies I've seen, superhero-related or not. It's not boring, for one thing, despite being almost two hours long. There are some good special effects, and some decent action sequences.Yet at the same time, the movie has a kind of been there, done that kind of feeling. Many of the characters and situations you will have seen before, or see that they've only been given a slight cosmetic change for this particular story. The movie also suffers from a problem many superhero movies have - being forced to go through the long process of showing how the main character became a superhero. This takes a long time, leaving only a limited amount of time to show the superhero after 'graduation' to be in action. Also, there are some unclear or simply unexplained plot points, like why the cops took so long to confront the Michael Douglas character.In the end, the movie is kind of minor league stuff. Despite its many problems, the movie doesn't really provoke hatred in the viewer. But at the same time, it's missing real spark as well as originality in many areas. Your reaction to the movie will likely be more positive the less you have to pay for watching it, as well as being more positive the less demanding you are feeling at the time.",Null,0,1,23 January 2016
Nightcrawler," Definitely not for all tastes
","I have to admit that in the first few minutes of this movie, I was sorely tempted to press the stop button on my DVD player's remote - the movie's central character was already off-putting, and Jake Gyllenhaal was giving this unlikable character a really strange performance. But something told me to stick with the movie, and in the end I am glad that I watched the entire thing. I thought that the movie was a good study of different characters in a disreputable occupation. I will admit that one theme of the movie - how uncaring and dirty-dealing the television reporting industry is - will come as no surprise to any viewer. But seeing how these different characters dealt with working in this industry was interesting. Though they were all loathsome, I was curious to see what would happen to them. Indeed, the movie has a very unHollywood ending (which I will not reveal except to say it felt pretty realistic.) And there are some real nail-biting scenes here and there to add some kick. But as I indicated in my summary line, this movie is definitely NOT for all tastes. I would suggest you read more reviews of the movie first before deciding whether it would appeal to you or not.",Null,0,0,14 July 2015
Bridge of Spies," Pretty good
","I'm not sure what caused me to pick up 'Bridge of Spies' when I found a Blu-ray copy of it at my library, since its length and the fact that it had Tom Hanks (an actor who usually gives me annoyance) seemed to be obstacles. But I'm glad I did. While the movie is long (140 minutes), credit director Steven Spielberg for making the package chug along fairly briskly, while at the same time showing that the world of espionage in real life is often a lot of work and not flashy business. The acting is also pretty good; even I had to admit that Tom Hanks does a pretty good job here, giving his character a kind of everyman feel that gives him sympathy.The only real flaw that the movie has is that it doesn't go into depth enough with some key details - namely the backstory of both Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and American pilot Francis Gary Powers. Now, I actually knew a lot about their real life stories before watching the movie, so I was able to fill in the blanks. But I suspect most viewers will know little to nothing about both men before watching the movie, so they may be scratching their heads every so often. However, I will admit devoting more time to these real life individuals may have made the movie overlong. So you may want to research both individuals before watching this movie.",Null,0,0,16 June 2016
Ender's Game," Not terrible, but it doesn't quite work
","First of all, I feel I should mention that ten or so years ago I did read the novel that this movie is based on, and I remember enjoying it. Sitting down to watch this cinematic adaptation, I did expect some elements would be cut down or eliminated entirely. Which is what happened, and the cuts made to the story really suffer. The emotional heart of the story - Ender's relationship with his sister Valentine, and the subplot about her going-ons while Ender is away - is almost entirely missing, so much so that viewers who haven't read the book will wonder why Valentine is in the movie in the first place, since she seems to serve no real purpose. There are further cuts that make the movie suffer. The beginning is VERY rushed and will have many viewers wanting more explanation. And the movie never really gets into the head of its youthful hero (or any other character for that matter.) The cast does make a great effort, but there's not much they can do.On a positive note, the special effects and sets are first rate - they do bring to life the backdrop of the novel. Also, I will admit that the movie is never boring - it does move along at a swift pace. But I would have sacrificed the swift speed for a story with more heart and explanation. I think that if the movie ran an additional hour (or had been split into two movies 90 to 120 minutes each), things would have been a lot better. The movie as it is kills time easily enough, but even if you haven't read the book, you'll see potential that was not fulfilled.",Null,0,1,11 May 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Merely okay, though that might be enough for some viewers
","Though I have seen every 'Mission: Impossible' movie before watching this one, I have to confess that I thought all the previous entries were watchable but ultimately forgettable. If I were pressed, I could not remember much about any of them. This new entry proves to be more of the same. I will admit that I didn't find it anywhere near an excruciating experience. It looks pretty slick, has some good action sequences, and while it's over two hours in length, I was never bored at any moment. But all the same, I found a lot of the movie to be somewhat predictable; some 'surprise' twists were no surprise. Also, while the movie is coherent for the most part, there are a few minor plot details (like how Tom Cruise's character spent six months uncovering the bad guys and how he tracked them down) that are never explained. Also, the chief villain gets a lot less screen time than you might think, which makes him less of a threat than the movie thinks he is. Another disappointment is with the climatic sequence - it's surprisingly small scale and generic in feel. In the end, the movie is like a hot drink on a cold day - it does its job for a short time, but you are unlikely to remember the experience for a long time.",Null,2,4,6 March 2016
Now You See Me," Promising idea sunk in key areas
","'Now You See Me' came out of nowhere and became the sleeper hit of 2013, getting good word of mouth during its theatrical run. Having seen the movie for myself, I am kind of puzzled by its popularity. Certainly, the movie is far from the worst movies I have ever seen - it's colorful, and doesn't have a dead spot despite running almost two hours long. But there were some things about the movie that annoyed me enough to prevent me from liking it. The biggest problem is with the characters. Except for Freeman's character, there is not one likable character in the movie. The law enforcement agents investigating the magicians are loud and obnoxious, and the four magicians come across as extremely smug. (Also, there is no attempt to give the magicians real and separate personalities - they all act alike.)The characters were the main reason why I didn't like this movie, but there were other problems as well. One other major annoyance is the depiction of the magic acts. They have been jazzed up with CGI and other special effects so they don't feel like REAL magic acts - they come across as artificial. Also, as the movie progresses, the various feats the magicians pull off slowly become more unbelievable (and not fully explained) that eventually I wanted to cry out loud, 'Oh, COME ON!' Less slight of hand and a more realistic approach would have been a much better approach.(Note to Michael Caine fans: His role is really just an extended cameo appearance.)",Null,11,15,13 September 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Visually impressive, though lacking in its script
","I have a feeling that many young people would go ape for 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'. It involves both young people, and its video game elements will be greatly appealing to youths. However, I think older people (like myself) will be somewhat let down by the movie.Before I get to criticizing the movie, let me say that I did feel the movie had SOME positive elements. The visual effects are top notch, successfully crossing live action with what you might see in a video game. There are also a lot of small touches here and there that are amusing, like defeated opponents transforming into coins.The visual look of the movie combined with those small touches ALMOST makes up for the flaws in the movie. The source of all the flaws is the same: the script. The script is really inadequate in a number of areas. The biggest flaw is that except for the character of Knives, NONE of the characters are sympathetic or appealing. They come across as thoughtless and kind of dumb, especially the title figure. Another script problem is that much of the movie consists of it repeating several times stuff that has already happened. The movie becomes monotonous after a while. Also, the ending is very frustrating, with Scott (in my opinion) choosing the wrong person to be with.I have not read the graphic novel series this movie is based on, but my guess is based on its length, a LOT of character development and story was cut out in order to make the movie last a little under two hours. So if you have a choice, I would advise you read the multi-part graphic novel instead of seeing this movie.",Null,30,50,26 November 2012
The Love Guru," Strange...
","I always make it a point to watch the movie that was voted as 'Worst movie of the year' for the Razzie awards, and that's why I watched 'The Love Guru' despite the horrendous reviews. While I don't think the movie is as bad as some people have portrayed it, I will admit that it isn't very good.Where did it go wrong? Well, I think the first way is the way the central protagonist is portrayed. I read a review that stated that Meyers, when it came to Austin Powers, made that character likable despite stuff like his sex obsession - unlike the central character here. I have to agree. I won't say that the guru is hateful, but he comes across as a very weird individual with an unbelievable obsession for certain things that don't seem to be tempered by anything positive. At times you want him to be given a slap in the face to shake him out of his giggily mood and make him do something sensible.Meyers in real life should have also been given a slap at the screenplay stage. It seems no one tried to stop his frequent infantile attempts at humor. Don't get me wrong, there are some attempts at humor that do succeed (the Bollywood parody being the movie's best gag), but other than isolated moments like those, the screenplay bombards the viewers with penis jokes and other 'naughty' gags that seem to come from a 10 year old boy.Combining that character and the infantile humor level, the end results are so strange that the movie almost makes it worth seeing to see such a unique kind of cinematic disaster. Note I said 'almost'.",Null,1,6,27 October 2009
Wreck-It Ralph," Good, but could have been better
","I put aside playing video games a number of years ago, but all the same I sat down to watch 'Wreck-It Ralph' with a smile on my face, because I was anticipating nostalgia from seeing references to video games I used to play. As it turned out, a feeling of nostalgia did go through me a number of times, but there were other good things about the movie. The animation is excellent, and there aren't any dull spots anywhere in the story.However, all the same I did feel that the script should have been worked on some more before the animators started to bring the story to life. The premise doesn't feel totally original - sharp viewers will recognize elements from other family movies ranging from 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' to 'Toy Story'. Another problem is that there are some noticeable gaps in the story, where linking footage seems missing. (This may be because the movie as it is runs over 100 minutes, quite long for an animated movie. Maybe some cuts were made during production.) The biggest problem with the movie, however, is that except for the characters of Wreck-It Ralph and Vanellope, there is not one likable character in the movie. At least, when it comes to likable characters that are given some depth and personality.I suspect that these problems won't bother (younger) kids in the audience, who will probably gobble this movie up. As for older kids and adults, while they may see the same problems as I did, they will all the same find the movie okay. There are a lot worse family movies out there.",Null,0,2,7 April 2015
The Transporter," Thin plot + badly constructed action scenes = boredom
","First of all, I feel I should point out that it was actually CORY YUEN who directed the movie, NOT Louis Leterrier (who was actually the ARTISTIC director). This fact is listed on the DVD box and in the opening credits. Still, I can understand why who originally submitted the credits to the IMDb may have been confused, because you would be kind of hard pressed to successfully compare this to Yuen's (usually superior) Hong Kong product.Before that, a look at the plot. We have an extremely thin plot here. All that's going on is more or less a simple smuggling operation. The bad guys behind it are simply greedy gloaters who will kill if it's necessary - and that's ALL that's done with them! Even with the two ringleaders; about all that's different about them is their ethnicity. It isn't much better with the protagonists. Jason Statham looks good and throws himself into the action well, but he can't do much more than that, playing the same old tired hard-lined loner with a murky past. Shu Qi is pretty, though sometimes has problems with her English dialogue, and her character is even thinner than Statham's.Now back to the action. The scenes did have the potential to be great - a fight in oil, struggling all over a transport truck speeding down a freeway - but they are ruined by what quite often ruins action scenes in Hollywood movies (despite the fact the creative part of this particular movie is non-American):(1) Too-quick camera movements (usually hand-held)(2) Unbelievably fast editing, that chops up the action instead of holding sight of it and playing it out like a ballet of sorts (what you will find in the best Hong Kong action movies.I also need to point out that the editing in this case is even worse, sometimes cutting out 'links' that result in people or cars all of a sudden jumping from one place to another.No need to rent this, when there are plenty of good action movies already sitting in the catalog sections of your local video stores. Even if you see this for free, it's still likely you'll feel ripped-off at the end.",Null,2,8,3 May 2003
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Worth seeing
","'Tucker and Dale vs Evil' is a low budget breath of fresh air. The movie takes the standard 'killer rednecks' genre and completely twists it around to make the entire enterprise original. Seeing things twisted around results in a lot of humorous and unexpected moments. But the movie remembers it's a B movie, and makes sure to deliver a lot of gory sequences (though no nudity, surprisingly.) The acting all around is very good, with top honors going to the actors who play the title characters.It's a movie well worth seeing, though I have two (minor) quibbles with it. First of all, after a while, the movie seems to be repeating the same joke over and over. Though the joke in question is a fresh and funny joke, towards the end it still feels a little extended. The other objection I had is with the cinematography - the colors often look too washed out when they should have been stronger. Still, those two nitpicks didn't stop me from enjoying the movie.",Null,1,1,15 December 2011
It Follows," Somewhat creepy, but not for all horror fans
","Though I did know the basic premise of this movie before seeing it, I didn't know anything else about it apart from the fact it was getting excellent word of mouth. So I didn't have any real expectations except to get spooked to a certain degree. I did find the movie reasonably creepy... but I don't think every horror fan will embrace the movie. I will list what I liked about the movie. The premise (which I won't spoil) had some originality to it. I also liked the fact that the movie seemed to be trying hard to emulate the kind of regional horror movies that came out in the early 1980s or so, such as the dark cinematography to the musical score. Most of all, the movie aimed to be creepy the majority of the time with atmosphere and mood instead of in-your-face shocks. Though I liked the movie for those things I mentioned above, I have to admit that I don't think all horror fans will go for it. It's a quite slow-moving movie, which may frustrate horror fans who are prepared for roller coaster speed thrills. Also, there is precious little in the way of special effects and bloody horror elements, which may disappoint people prepared for spectacle. (Most of the movie's special effects and blood come in the climax.) And I will admit that the story has some confusing and/or unexplained elements, though fortunately they are minor plot details. So I really think your possible enjoyment (or possible dislike) of the movie is a matter of taste... as well as with what particular mood you are in at the time.",Null,4,15,19 April 2015
Get Out," Not bad, though a bit overrated
","With so many critics giving this movie great reviews, I knew I had to eventually give it a look for myself. Though after watching it, I am not sure why it got as much fuss as it did. Don't get me wrong, I am glad I watched it, since it does have some genuine merit. Writer and director Jordan Peele does manage to capture the feeling of racial tensions in America quite well; while people may appear to be accepting, there is often still some uneasiness. He also gets good performances out of the no-name cast and makes the movie look good despite a pittance of a budget. As for horror scares and tension, there are also some effective stabs in this area. However, you'll have to wait a long time for the central character to really find himself in trouble. At 104 minutes in length, the movie is somewhat too long and stretched out. While the movie never gets to be boring, there's a significant amount of footage that could have been eliminated, which would have speeded up the pace significantly. Yes, watch the movie, but wait until you are in a more patient mood.",Null,0,2,3 June 2017
Frozen," Why is this movie so adored?
","Most likely from my summary line, you have guessed that I wasn't thrilled by this Disney animated film. I hadn't watched one of Disney's (new) animated movies for a number of years, since I started to find them formulaic and repeating the same elements over and over. I only broke down and watched this one after hearing so much hype and praise for it for so long. And after watching it, I'm glad that I didn't shell out any money to see it (I got the Blu-ray from my local library.) I admit that it's not completely awful - the movie does LOOK good, with first rate animation as well as bright and vibrant colors. But the scripting leaves a lot to be desired. It's a pretty predictable (and very Disney) script, with plot developments and character actions that you'll likely see coming a mile away. And the comedy relief is bland at its best, and downright annoying at its worst. As for the songs, they all pretty much sounded the same, made worse by the constant forced rhymes and other clunky lyrical elements; even the Oscar-winning 'Let It Go' is a disappointment. Any animated movie produced by Walt Disney during his lifetime is much better than this one (even 'The Sword in the Stone' was better than this!) Incidentally, I heard that they are making a sequel to this movie. Oh boy, I can hardly wait.",Null,5,13,25 September 2016
2012," The bad and the good
","There are bad things and good things to say about 2012. First, the bad stuff. The science of the movie makes no sense, even though they try twice to explain why everything is going wrong. They manage to build the entire rescue system for the chosen survivors in just three years. The comedy relief is bad. There are contrived coincidences. There's heavy-handed symbolism. They show people taking off in planes just seconds before danger strikes THREE TIMES. It's easy to figure out who will live and die. And with a running time of over 2 1/2 hours, the movie goes far too long.But there are some good things to say about the movie. The opening twenty minutes of the movie is very engaging, being intriguing and will make you wonder what they are going to do. The special effects and the sets are professionally done. The movie is also surprisingly bleak for most of its running time, uncommon for a Hollywood movie, and makes you wonder if things will turn out okay in the end. And while the movie would have been helped by some trimming, I can't say that at any time I was seriously bored. Verdict: Wait until it comes on TV so you don't have to pay to see it. Odds will be greater then that you'll be entertained by the movie's frequent goofiness.",Null,1,1,6 March 2010
A Quiet Place," Not boring, but too many unanswered questions
","As my subject heading states, I didn't find 'A Quiet Place' to be dull. However, it has so many glaring unanswered questions that I was unable to enjoy what I was seeing. Here are just some of the unanswered questions I had (spoilers ahead): How did the aliens appear on Earth? What was their purpose of coming to Earth? (It couldn't have been just for running amok in the countryside? If the aliens rely on sound and not sight, how do they get around without bumping into things? Why aren't the aliens attracted to the sounds of crickets, rusty swings moving in the air, birds, or raging rivers and waterfalls? If the aliens can't detect noise from humans near raging rivers and waterfalls, why doesn't the family just live next to the rivers and waterfalls? If the aliens are indestructible (as seen on a blink-and-you'll-miss-it newspaper headline), why can they be killed by a shotgun? Why doesn't the family find shelter underground instead of out in the open?Look, I can accept some mystery and unexplained details in a science fiction movie. But when there is so much mystery and unexplained details as in this movie, the whole package then becomes very frustrating to watch. As a result, I can't recommend the movie despite its original premise, good production values, and professional performances. They might be able to answer questions in the upcoming sequel, but given that sequels are usually worse than the original, I'm going to pass on the opportunity to see it.",4,1,1,5 January 2019
22 Jump Street," Somewhat better than I anticipated
","Generally I am far from being a big fan of modern day youth-oriented comedies, so when I sat down to watch the first 'Jump Street' movie, I was filled with dread. To my surprise, I didn't find it so bad - it had a good amount of humorous moments that made me laugh. Despite this, I was not looking forward to this sequel, seeing how Hollywood sequels are almost always greatly inferior to the originals. But once again, I was surprised. This sequel does have some really funny moments, the best being those that poke fun of 'sequelitus' and various movie clichés. I really got the feeling the writers were laughing out loud when writing this script, because they seemed to admit how silly this movie was. The humor isn't perfect - there is definitely an over abundance of it tied with foul language and R- rated content, which seemed to suggest the writers at times were desperate for laughs and to be 'edgy'. There is also not quite enough plot, as well as a few plot points that are not made clear. And at 111 minutes, the movie does run too long. Despite these problems, I will say this: If you liked the first movie, chances are you'll like this sequel.",Null,0,2,24 May 2015
School of Rock," Maybe it's not intelligent - but it's funny and it rocks!
","Glancing at what other people have written about this movie, it seems that these individuals are taking this film a bit too seriously. Worrying about the 'messages' this movie is delivering? Come on, there is no way that the con that Jack Black's character pulls off could ever get far in the real world! I don't think any sane person watching this movie would take this seriously. This is a comedy, for crying out loud, made to make us laugh!I thought Black was fine in this movie. Sure, maybe his character is a little one-note with his proclamations of 'rock on' and 'stick it to the man', but Black somehow manages to do it over and over without being boring. He's unbelievably energetic AND versatile, delivering these same things in different ways each time that prevent the movie from getting into a rut. I think it's safe to say that only Black himself could have made this role work so well.There is plenty of humor and great music. Even my senior citizen parents kept laughing, and told me after it was over that they enjoyed the rock soundtrack as well. It's a great movie for the whole family. Why was this rated PG-13? Sure, there are some references to stuff like alcohol and groupies, but they are not emphasized at all in their brief passing - and your kids will already have seen these kind of things treated much worse elsewhere!

The Amazing Spider-Man 2," It's okay - could have been worse
","Of the five Spider-Man movies to date that have been made, I feel that 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' ranks second just behind the 2004 'Spider-Man 2'. I wasn't expecting much with this being a sequel to a reboot, but I was pleased to find some good things here. What pleasantly struck me most of all was how much more relaxed the movie felt compared to other modern Hollywood blockbusters, superhero oriented or not. The movie does make an attempt to add some humanity to the movie by a number of scenes with the characters just talking. That isn't to say that the movie doesn't deliver when it comes to action. There is a good amount of action, and it's directed in a way that's both exciting and much easier to follow than the frenzied approach in other modern day action movies. However, not everything about the movie is successful. One disappointment is with the character of Electro. While his scenes at the beginning of the movie promise that the character will be multi- dimensional, the movie soon makes him your standard screaming one note villain. The subplot with Peter Parker's friend Osborne doesn't seem quite finished; you don't get the feeling that they are close friends. And the end sequence involving the Rhino is embarrassing, from it being one villain too many to the special effects grossly betraying what the character was like in the comic books.When you weigh the good against the bad, the movie ends up being okay. I've seen better, I've seen worse. But to be honest, I think that the last drops of potential with a cinematic Spider-Man have been milked out with this entry. I would urge Columbia Pictures (and Marvel Entertainment) to not go any further and let the character rest for a number of years before trying again with a perspective that would then be fresh.",Null,0,11,15 June 2015
Evil Dead," I'm not sure why this doesn't work
","Unlike many horror fans, while I did enjoy the original 'Evil Dead' movie, I am certainly not hyper about my praise of it. This may be why, when I first heard about this remake, I wasn't yelling 'Blasphemy!' I was open to a new interpretation... at least as long as it was good and had some original ideas.The remake does have some positive features. The production values are pretty good, for one thing. There isn't a lull or boring moment any time during its 91 minutes. And there is a considerable amount of blood and gore.But despite those things, this remake overall didn't work for me. Why, I have to admit that I'm not quite sure. After a lot of thought, the closest I can come to explaining my lack of enthusiasm may be that the movie unfolds in a way that it seems you've seen all this stuff many times before. The 'surprises', the shocks, the behavior of the evil forces... to me, it didn't seem different from what I've seen in many other horror movies. Also, the movie may be too slick for its own good; the original low budget movie had a rawness that stuck in your mind and generated creepiness. While I won't say this is an awful remake, it feels very unnecessary. Stick with the original movie.",Null,1,17,18 July 2013

Jurassic World," Sort of watchable, but...
","To me, the fourth entry in the 'Jurassic Park' series has the same problem that another movie ('Tremors 5') released the same year by the same studio (Universal Pictures) had - it feels like they have gone to the well once too often. Certainly, this entry has the action and special effects you expect of any film of this series, and I wasn't really bored at any moment. But at the same time, the movie had a kind of fatigue to it. There aren't that many new ideas to be found in this entry, and the few new ideas that there are (like genetic modification to come up with new dinosaur species) aren't expanded on to great effect. The 'bad guy' dinosaur in this movie, with very little rewriting, could have been just another ornery T-Rex. In the end, the movie passes the time, and that is about it. Despite what I've just said, the enormous world-wide box office take for this movie no doubt means that a fifth entry in this series is inevitable.

Paranormal Activity," Not great... but better than BLAIR WITCH
","If you were as disappointed by 'The Blair Witch Project' as I was when it first came out, you will probably understand why I passed on 'Paranormal Activity' when it first came out, since this new movie seemed to have been inspired by 'Blair Witch'. I only ultimately rented this new movie when I had run out of other choices.To some degree, I was surprised. Overall, this is a better movie than 'Blair Witch'. For starters, this movie does a better job of laying out the situation at the beginning - there's no fat in this part of the movie, and the explanations for what is happening does not come across as forced. Also, the movie is clearly TRYING to spook its audience a number of times during the running time, unlike what I felt in 'Blair Witch'. Some of the low budget effects are impressive, and will have you thinking, 'How did they do that?' There is also a genuine feeling of building terror towards the end.But the movie is far from perfect. I didn't really care if the characters lived or died. For one thing, they seem pretty dim-witted at times - if this spooky stuff was happening to me, I would immediately get out of there or immediately contact the professionals! Also, though the terror starts building towards the end, the bulk of the movie is not very spooky at all. And the ending... well, I'll just say that I thought 'That's IT?' when the screen turned blank.This is a movie more interesting than scary. It's not recommended when you're in the mood to be entertained. But if you are a low budget filmmaker who wants inspiration, or interested in what filmmakers can accomplish on a micro budget, then this movie may be up your alley.",Null,0,4,7 January 2010
Elysium," Not as cerebral as it thinks it is
","After the entertaining 'District 9', I looked forward to seeing Neil Blomkamp's next movie, this one. But the disappointment I sensed from critics and audiences made me put off seeing it until today when I had the chance to see it for free. After watching it, I can kind of understand why a lot of viewers felt let down. Although it promises to be a more cerebral sci-fi adventure, there were a number of parts in that didn't feel written enough. The biggest disappointment is with the Elysium space station itself. We learn it's full of 'haves' who have retreated from the 'have nots', and that they have machines that give great healing power, but that's IT. We don't learn anything about the citizens, how their government is run, or a number of other issues that could have been interesting to see.I'm not saying that this is a terrible movie. It's never boring, there are some exciting action sequences (though also some that are hard to follow), and the special effects are very good. Still, watching the movie I often felt there was a lost opportunity to really explore some interesting ideas.

La La Land," Pleasant but ultimately forgettable
","I'm not really sure why 'La La Land' got both critical acclaim as well as a pretty good turnout at the box office. Maybe it's because Hollywood musicals are a rare thing these days, so it seemed fresh and original to people. It's not really a bad movie, I admit. The photography is first rate, the lead actors are likable, and some of the direction of the musical numbers is eye catching. However, the songs in these musical numbers, while easy on the ears, sound pretty much alike for the most part. And they are not really memorable; you'll forget the songs a few hours after watching the movie. Another problem is that the movie moves at a really slow pace. While at first the leisurely pace is refreshing in this era of in-your- face and strident movies, eventually you'll be asking the movie to simply get on with it. The movie is best reserved for a time when you want some pleasant background noise and images while doing a task that involves your main focus. Don't worry about missing any plot points - you'll be able to fill in the blanks easily and correctly.",Null,1,2,11 June 2017
Saw," Strong and effective for the most part
","I saw this when it first came out on DVD, and while I have forgotten a lot of movies I've seen as the years have passed, parts of this one really stuck with me. So I decided today to give it another look to see if it still had its bite. For the most part, it did. Though made for just $1.2 million, you could swear it was made for a lot more money - its look is utterly convincing. More importantly, it has the right feel and tone - it's bleak, horrific, graphic, and other adjectives that the best horror movies have.Though the movie is definitely good, it could have been made to be even better. There are several sequences (mostly in the first half of the movie) where the movie exits the washroom and shows flashbacks to what happened to the characters earlier. In these parts of the movie, the horrific spell is temporarily broken and the movie goes through the motions until returning to the washroom. I wonder what the movie would be like if it had been set entirely in the washroom. Maybe better. Another problem with the movie is that there are two or three points where the direction gets extremely flashy and flamboyant, again breaking the movie's disturbing tone. Fortunately, these parts don't last very long. While all these problems are why I don't think the movie is a modern horror classic, I will say that despite these problems, the movie gets close to that desired status.",Null,0,3,25 February 2015
Don't Breathe," Well done for the most part
","I don't understand why the major Hollywood studios don't make more low to medium budgeted movies. The financial risk is lower, the return on every invested dollar has a good chance of being higher than on a big budget movie, and the filmmakers of these movies tend to work harder in many aspects to deliver the goods to the audience since they don't have the money for special effects and other eye candy details. 'Don't Breathe' is an example of such a success. Not just with its financial success at the box office, but that clearly a lot of thought went to figuring out how to entertain its audience on a fairly low budget. The movie is fast-paced, with a story that gets right to business quickly and has no unnecessary fat. The thrills come with old fashioned suspense, which still works in this age of CGI. I have to admit that I was riveted from start to finish, wondering which character (if any) would win out or even survive.However, I will admit that the movie is not perfect. There are some murky and sometimes hard to swallow plot points, like (spoilers ahead!) how the blind man managed to get his hands on the woman in the basement in the first place, or managed to hide her body completely once the cops came. And while I can believe blind people in real life can work well in and out of home without sight, some of the blind man's elaborate actions in this movie were a bit unbelievable. Fortunately, these and other somewhat questionable script details don't interfere too much, and the movie still ends up being a pretty good thriller.",Null,3,7,3 January 2017
Sausage Party," Had promise, but isn't all that funny
","There are very few major Hollywood studio animated movies made for adults, so it's a double shame when one of them does not work, since the failure probably won't encourage more to be made. 'Sausage Party' is unfortunately one of those failures. What makes it even a sadder failure is that you see a better, cleverer, and funny movie seemingly being held back by a creative team that has the wrong idea of what an adult audience would like. I will admit that the movie is fairly well animated for what wasn't a mega budget. And occasionally there is a gag that will make the viewer smile or even chuckle a little. But unfortunately, the level of humor for the most part is pretty wrong-headed. We get offensive racial stereotypes, questionable attempts at humor (such as a 'rape' sequence involving food products), and the belief that characters constantly uttering foul language is the stuff of hilarity. I wasn't bored, but all the same I sat in my TV chair pretty stone-faced throughout. If you are looking for animation made for an adult audience, look for an offering from Japan instead.",3,1,4,21 September 2018
Edge of Tomorrow," MUCH better than I expected
","I put off seeing 'Edge of Tomorrow' for a long time, the main reason being that I am not exactly a fan of Tom Cruise. But after hearing one good report after another about the movie for a long time, I finally broke down and rented the Blu-ray. And I'm very glad that I did. This is one big budget sci-fi movie that's very well done for the most part. The basic plot isn't completely original - you'll see some small touches of 'Groundhog Day' here and there - but it is handled with intelligence. The character played by Tom Cruise (who I must admit is good in this role) may be a coward (at first), but he's not stupid - he soon catches on to what's happening and does what you'd probably do in the same position. You'll probably guess what happens at the end before it actually happens, but all the same you won't feel your intelligence is insulted. As a bonus, the action sequences are also well handled, being very exciting while having the feeling things may not go according to anyone's plan. If I have a complaint about the movie, it's that some of the special effects - mainly the depiction of the aliens - don't quite convince, coming across as obvious CGI creations. But I'd rather have this movie than one that's ultra slick-looking but stupidly scripted.",Null,3,5,10 January 2015

Even adults who are not parents will love it!There's humor, there's action, there's nostalgia, there's the perfect capture of being a child, there are positive messages (be yourself, don't kill, etc.), there's satire, there are adults who are not stupid and not comic relief....there's GREAT WRITING!AND NO SONG AND DANCE NUMBERS! Also, there are NO COMIC-RELIEF ANIMAL SIDEKICKS! Take that, Disney! I know some people might be resisting this movie, because it looks like it's aimed for kids - and they might be expecting a Disney clone (and we all know the bad results of Disney wannabes).....but TRUST ME. Give this movie a chance - you'll love it!Is there ANYTHING wrong with it? Well, the only thing that bugged me (just a little) were some close-ups of the characters - these certain close-ups had a 'sketchy' look a la the movies 'We're Back!' and 'Balto'.Fortunately, there's very little of this. Other than that - this is a PERFECT MOVIE!",10,207,245,6 August 1999
The Woman in Black," Some genuine atmosphere, but there are some problems
","I was curious to see what the new Hammer film production company would do making a horror movie for the 21st century, so that's why I sat down to watch 'The Woman In Black'. After seeing it, my feelings are kind of mixed. First, the good things in the movie. The LOOK of the movie is great; you can really feel the cold and dark environment the characters are in, and the sets and special effects are very good. In part due to this, director James Watkins also manages to build a genuinely eerie feeling throughout. He also gets good performances out of his cast - you can believe the movie's characters are living and breathing people.However, the movie also has some shortcomings. For starters, the movie throughout presents a level of horror that's kind of light. It's generally with people thinking they are seeing or hearing things, and it doesn't progress more than that. That's a fine way to start a horror movie, but I eventually got a little impatient - I wanted some stronger shocks eventually. Another problem is that the movie is somewhat slow and drawn out. There's enough material for an hour long 'Twilight Zone' episode, but there's not enough story here for a feature film. While I was never bored, I could clearly see that the movie was often spinning its wheels.In the end, the movie is overall okay. It definitely has some good stuff, but it also has some issues that clearly should have been worked on before filming started. Wait until it comes on cable during a slow weekend.",Null,0,1,1 April 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," Feels pretty flat throughout
","Let me assure long time readers of my IMDb user comments that I didn't pay to see this movie - I waited until I could get the Blu- ray from my local library for free. And I certainly wasn't wanting to watch it from a serious viewpoint - I had heard from some sources that it was unintentionally funny. Sad to say, though there was indeed some dopey dialogue and situations, there isn't much unintended humor to be found here. That's not to say that the movie is pretty good, however. There are many problems to be found with this story, but I think the biggest was that I simply couldn't believe that this particular female protagonist would fall for the charms (and kinks) of the character of Christian Grey. At least how it's portrayed here - her being seduced happens WAY fast. Just as flawed is that the movie doesn't seem to have a point or moral - the movie ends in a way that had me thinking, 'Just what was the purpose of what I saw?' Oh, I guess the filmmakers were trying simply to be erotic and kinky, but to be honest, I didn't find the sex, nudity, and kinks terribly erotic - they come across as too staged and unnatural. (And women viewers will probably also object to the fact that there's not much male nudity on display here.) The one bit of merit to be found in the movie is that director Sam Taylor-Johnson does capture the cold and gloom of Seattle pretty well, and that does add some effective atmosphere in the background.",Null,1,2,28 July 2015
Saving Mr. Banks," Taken as entertainment, it's pretty good
","As some people have pointed out, the idea of the Disney company making a movie about the making of one of their movies at first thought explains why the word 'chutzpah' was invented. And there is also the bothersome idea that this is yet another example of the truth being distorted on its way to becoming a movie. Despite those potential obstacles, I was surprised that in the end I enjoyed this movie. While the movie at times plays fast and loose with the facts, it does so to make the end results entertaining instead of dry. And the movie all the same manages to succeed in showing how authors can be very protective of their works as well as what often has to be done to translate a book into a movie. Also, the movie manages to show what a real pain in the butt the real P. L. Travers often was to Walt Disney and his associates. As Travers, Emma Thompson gives a great performance. Even Tom Hanks, an actor I normally can't stand, manages like Thompson to disappear in his role as Walt Disney.The PG-13 rating for the movie seems a little harsh. Though the movie does deal with topics such as alcoholism and attempted suicide, I would have given it a PG rating. However, I am not sure that young children are the right audience for the movie. I suspect they might be bored by the movie's talky spirit and lack of action. Adults and older children with patience seem a better audience for the movie.",Null,0,1,29 March 2014
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Kids will be bored... and adults will find it a tough slog too
","I did read the Roald Dahl children's book 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' when I was a child, and I remember enjoying it, though I did have some issues with it (more on that later). When I sat down to watch this filmed version of the tale, I couldn't help but wonder how they would take what was a somewhat short book and make it to feature film length. As it turns out, only a short amount of the movie follows the book; the first third is a new backstory, then the next fifteen minutes or so follows the book, and the remaining running time is a kind of a sequel to what happened in the book. The sequel portion of the movie is a little interesting, since as a child I wondered what happened after the point where the book ended. Though at times it felt like blatant padding, just like what the first thirty minutes felt at times. But the padding wasn't the main issue I had with the movie. The problem was the same that I had with the book as a child - I didn't much like the character of Mr. Fox, even more so in this movie. In the movie, he is such a braggart, a heartless thief, and so irresponsible that I was greatly annoyed by him. This is a fatal blow, in my opinion.As for the animation, it was interesting to watch, if a little crude and cheap at times. But interesting animation almost never makes up for unlikable characters and boring story padding. I have a feeling that if Dahl were alive to see this filmed adaptation of his book, he'd be very unhappy... though reports state that he disliked almost all of the filmed adaptations of his writing.",Null,1,3,13 February 2017
Lucy," Certainly not dull... but has some big problems
","Even without using the drug that increases the brain power of the movie's title character, one can quickly figure out why the movie was a big box office success. The idea of one's brain power increasing greatly is an intriguing one. And writer/director Luc Besson does keep the movie fast-paced, with plenty of action and special effects along the way.Despite this, I think Besson should have worked on the script some more, because there are some major problems with it. The earliest and most glaring problem is the character of Lucy herself. We know nothing about her when she finds herself in trouble, and we learn little about her for the rest of the movie. Also, she is kind of a cold and heartless character once the drug starts to kick in; among other things, she hurts (or kills) innocent people along the way. And there are some glaring flaws with her actions, like why she doesn't kill the chief bad guy when she gets the chance to halfway through the movie, as well as why in the climax she doesn't take care of the bad guys BEFORE subjecting herself to the actions of the scientists. And the abrupt end will have most people in the audience saying, 'That's IT?!?'The movie is not without merit, but in the end it shapes itself to be a brainless treatment of a cerebral subject. I realize that there are some people in some situations who might find the movie a breezy way to pass the time... but if you are smart enough to know you are smart, I would strongly suggest you find another movie. Action movies made by the right hands can be smart, but this one simply is lacking brains.",Null,0,3,1 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Fairly enjoyable... but very derivative
","With the, ahem, force of so many user comments for this movie already - and with no doubt much more to come - I wonder if anyone here will read my comments on this movie. (Please leave a vote if you did!) Anyway, I just got back from seeing this movie after waiting so long to see it, and my verdict is... mixed. There are some good things about it, for sure. There aren't any slow spots, there is a lot of action, some of it pretty exciting. The sets, props, and special effects, of course, are excellent. And it was great to see the classic characters once again.However... I guess I was expecting something a lot more original. On a regular basis, something happened in the movie that made me think, 'Gee, I've seen this before in one of the original three movies.' (Mostly from A NEW HOPE, as it turns out.) The biggest of these was the prime threat the protagonists are fighting - it almost made me shout in the theater, 'They are doing this AGAIN?!?!?' Another disappointment I had was with the use of one of the classic characters. I won't reveal who it is, but the use of this character turns out to be a frustrating tease.Should you see this movie? Maybe. There are some good things - and the movie is better than the prequels - but at the same time the movie covers familiar turf too often. If you do decide to see it, I would recommend you go to a cheap matinÃ©e and have your expectation lowered.",Null,8,20,30 December 2015
The Purge," Overall, it passes the time in an okay fashion
","A quick look at some of the other user comments for this movie reveal that a lot of people sure didn't like it. My viewpoint is somewhat kinder. I will admit that the movie is flawed - it has a great premise, but in the end the movie becomes a tale of kill or be killed, with quite a bit of violence that comes across as absolutely gratuitous. Some of the characters act quite stupidly and/or unbelievably, such as the action the boyfriend of the teenage girl character does to try and resolve the conflict he has with his girlfriend's father. On the other hand, the production values are solid - it's hard to believe the movie only cost $3 million dollars. And I can't say that I was *bored* at any time while watching the movie - it moves at a pretty brisk clip and does not outstay its welcome. I would suggest you wait for a time you are not in a particularly demanding mood before sitting down to watch it. The lower your expectations, the more likely your viewing experience will be an acceptable one. Though come to think of it, that last sentence might be interpreted as a warning to a number of potential viewers.",Null,0,0,12 October 2013
Godzilla," Not what I was expecting
","So far in my lifetime, I have only seen a few Japanese Godzilla movies, so I can't say that I'm an expert on the Godzilla genre. However, I do feel confident enough to say that the 1998 American Godzilla movie was a mockery to the genre. But my hopes were up that this reboot of sorts would be an improvement. It was... kind of. It takes itself much more seriously than the annoyingly goofy 1998 movie. The special effects are also pretty good, giving a good portrait of the monsters and the destruction they make.But in the end, I was kind of unsatisfied. For starters, you might think that the movie would showcase Godzilla a lot, but you would be wrong. The movie is about two hours long, but for the first ninety or so minutes, Godzilla hardly makes an appearance! This is not the only case where the movie is coy. There are a number of scenes where the action starts brewing, but then the movie abruptly cuts to another location or the same location some time later. This is extremely frustrating. Another big problem is that while the monsters LOOK good, they don't get to show a lot of personality. The rubber suit monsters in the Japanese Godzilla movies managed to deliver a lot more personality than the monsters in this movie.While I guess I could scrape up some more (somewhat) positive things to say about this movie, such as it's not boring (though it gets close to being boring at times), in the end the strongest thing I can say about this movie is that if you want to see an American Godzilla movie, watch this one instead of the 1998 version. Not exactly an endorsement, but it's the best I can do.",Null,1,1,24 February 2015
Life," Flat and derivative
","If you have been around the science fiction film block a reasonable number of times, you will almost certainly see that the premise of 'Life' is heavily derived from the movie 'Alien'. But originality in Hollywood these days is a rare thing, and I was open to seeing the same story again as long as it was done with style and a few original touches. Unfortunately, the end results pretty much lack those ingredients. The first third or so of the movie is surprisingly dull - the movie can't find awe and wonder about the premise of finding alien life from another planet, believe it or not. Then when the alien lifeform subsequently becomes a threat, you would think there would be plenty of scares and tense moments. But surprisingly, that's not the case. The so-called terror feels... well... flat. I think a big reason for that is that the human characters are not well developed. They are so bland that it's hard to care about them and feel the so-called terror that they are experiencing. The only saving grace the movie has are a few good special effects, though there are also some special effect moments that comes across as surprisingly crude and clunky (bad CGI rears its ugly head in a Hollywood movie once more!) You'd be better off rewatching 'Alien' than this clone.",Null,9,20,8 July 2017
What We Do in the Shadows," Amusing vampire comedy
","After hearing so many good reports about this movie - and remembering that New Zealand has made some really funny offbeat comedies (like the early works of Peter Jackson) - I decided to give it a look. And for the most part, I am glad I gave it a chance. It is indeed very amusing at times. I think that the reason the movie is humorous is that it has a very warm viewpoint towards the characters. Yes, some of the acting is a little rough, but these characters come across as HUMAN despite being vampires. They have needs, they have weaknesses, and other attributes that we in the audience can identify with. You'll like them despite their blood sucking. Speaking of blood sucking, the gore and the special effects are quite good for what had to have been a really low budget.If there is a weakness to this movie, it is in the story department. I realize the movie is a mockumentary following the characters in a day by day format (or make that night by night!), but for the longest time the movie is pretty episodic. After a while, you'll wish for some plot to come in to challenge the characters and add in some real drama. This lack of plot I believe holds the movie back from being great. But there's still enough here to make for a very enjoyable viewing.",Null,1,3,4 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Uneven, but certainly not dull
","Sitting down to watch 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', I had no prior knowledge of the movie except that it was a modern film take on the idea of the British secret service. I don't know what I was expecting, but I didn't expect what I saw. I am not saying that this is a terrible movie. The production values are slick, there are some exhilarating action sequences, and the movie thankfully does not take things completely seriously. However, the comedy and the action really does not mix. The comedy is really goofy at times, while the action is really hard core at times, and the two extremes don't really mix. And at over two hours in length, the movie goes on too long. (I should add that even at that length, there are a few minor plot gaps that suggest some linking footage was cut out or not filmed at all.) But as I said in my summary line, I was not bored. This movie is a matter of taste; I can see why some people would not like it. Who would like it? I think those who are fans of the sometimes over the top action/comedy cinema coming out of Hong Kong would best appreciate this film. You've been warned (or given a recommendation.)",Null,2,7,9 August 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," Action compensates for some genuine weaknesses
","I enjoyed the original 'John Wick' movie, and in my IMDb review I said that I would return for the sequel if start Keanu Reeves and director Chad Stahelski returned for it. Well, both things happened, so I was sure to rent the Blu-ray when it came out. Like the first movie, this sequel seems to have split people - either you like it, or you hate it. I did like it, though I will freely admit that it isn't perfect. The complaint that it doesn't have much in the way of character development is true to a degree. It is hard to get into the head of the title character (or any other character). John Wick is more or less just portrayed as an extreme killing machine, and a few scenes of him looking at photos of his departed sweetheart don't really do anything.The movie is more a vehicle to showcase hardcore action. But if you are just in the mood to see a lot of action, the movie does deliver the goods... eventually. After the opening action-packed ten minutes of the movie, you have to wait forty five minutes or so for the action to start coming again. But when it does, it's worth the wait. Gunplay, martial arts, the movie has it all when it comes to action, and it's very well staged (and very violent.)I know this movie isn't for everybody. If you didn't like the first movie, you certainly won't like this sequel. But if you liked the first movie and simply want to sit back and have some non-think kind of entertainment, the movie does reasonably entertain for a couple of hours. I went into the movie with that frame of mind, and I was entertained. If Reeves and Stahelski return for part 3, I will definitely give it a look.",Null,0,0,8 July 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Believe the hype
","After hearing so much good feedback about this movie, I finally broke down and headed to my neighborhood theater to see it... though in the back of my mind I was thinking, 'It can't be THAT good!' Well, it's been about an hour and half after walking out of the theater, and I'm still feeling blown away. The reports of the movie being almost non-stop action are true - it's basically one action sequence after another. Now, normally I would probably object to the fact that all this action doesn't leave much room for story or character development, but the action is top notch and filled with much variety, so my interest was always up. Also, in this age of CGI and quick edits, the action in this movie goes against the norm for the most part, using practical effects and more relaxed editing so that it's very easy to follow all the action. However, I will admit that the movie is not perfect. Here are a few quibbles I had with the movie:(1) A substantial amount of dialogue is hard to make out, due to a combination of thick accents and lots of background noise(2) The Max Max character actually is up and center a lot less than you think. In the first half hour, he's mostly pushed to the sidelines. He does get more to do in the subsequent portion of the movie, but even then there's almost a feeling he's a supporting character and not a lead character.(3) I did not understand the visions the Max Max character had several times of an unidentified female character. Who was he thinking of? It's not explained.(4) The chief villain of the movie is not fleshed out enough, and the complaints I've read here from other IMDb users that he's more or less a clone of the villain in 'The Road Warrior' do have some weight.Despite those quibbles, I did enjoy the movie a lot. I will see it again when it's released on Blu-ray (though I will certainly turn the English captions option on first!)",Null,5,17,16 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Never boring, though kind of a mixed bag in the end
","Mel Gibson's 'Hacksaw Ridge' in many ways has a strong echo of the 1941 Gary Cooper movie 'Sergeant York', though both movies were based on actual events (yet in different wars). It has a lot of touches (particularly in the first half) that many present day viewers will consider to be old-fashioned, from the plot turns to the dialogue. While you could probably get away with these creaky touches decades ago, today most viewers will probably find them hokey. To be fair to Gibson, as clichéd as the movie may get at times, it never gets to be dull despite a running time of about 140 minutes; Gibson moves from scene to scene at a fairly fast pace. And when the movie does get to the battlefront, Gibson does show that warfare is serious stuff and not fun at all. The fighting is bloody and ruthless, yet at the same time you can't look away. (Though the use of very unconvincing CGI blood when people get shot does lessen the impact.)So in the end, the movie as a whole generates mixed results. I can understand why some people would like the movie, but I can also see why some people would dislike it. Since I don't know what your movie tastes are like, I cannot say what you'll probably think of it. Judge for yourself.",Null,0,5,25 March 2017

","If I had to sum up 'The Social Network' in just a few words, I would probably say, 'It's an interesting movie about an unlikable man'. At least, that's the impression the filmmakers seem to have about Mark Zuckerberg. Though to their credit, they don't completely portray Zuckerberg as unlikable - he is shown to be socially awkward, among other things. I can personally relate to that trait myself. That's one of the many interesting things to be found in this movie. Other things include showing how the world of business can be a cutthroat game, where friendship and loyalty sometimes don't mean a darn. The movie isn't perfect - though then again, few movies are. I would have liked to have been given a little background on Zuckerberg - we learn nothing about his past. Some of the technical jargon is a little hard to follow if you know little to nothing about computers (or Facebook, for that matter.) Also, the second half of the movie does have some lengthy portions that run a little slow (though they don't get to be downright boring.) All the same, the praise this movie has received is definitely worthy.",Null,0,0,7 December 2015
Alien: Covenant," Nothing new here
","'Alien: Covenant' underperformed at the box office, and it doesn't take long into watching the movie to start figuring out reasons why audiences weren't that enthusiastic about it. It's a really tired affair - a great deal of the plot takes elements from past films in the series, mostly with the first and second movie. And these familiar elements aren't exactly presented in a fresh and interesting light. As for the new elements in the story, they consist mostly of plot stupidities (the characters land on and explore a new planet without taking any precautions or pre-landing studies!) and confusing plot touches, like the alien race that got wiped out. If you are just looking for slimy aliens and the havoc that they create, you'll still be disappointed - there's surprisingly much less alien action than you might think. Special effects are erratic - some are good, and some are substandard. In the end, this is a movie that feels like a rough draft instead of a finished feature movie. Stick with the first two movies of the series instead.",Null,1,4,28 August 2017
The Martian," Pretty well done
","Contrary to what you might be thinking, the idea behind 'The Martian' is not as original as you might believe. Way back in 1964, the movie 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars' did the basic idea first. Of course, in the more than fifty years that have passed since that movie was made, special effects have improved greatly and we now know a lot more about Mars - which results in 'The Martian' being pretty convincing in what it portrays (though I'm not sure if astronauts could hear sound in Mars' atmosphere.) The movie takes its time in showing the details of what one would have to face stranded on Mars, and while this does result in a very long movie (140 minutes in length), the movie is never boring or tedious, even with some predictable touches thrown in now and then. The movie is certainly not perfect. Besides those predictable touches, there are some flaws with the writing of the title character. We only get to know him for a few minutes before he finds himself stranded on Mars, so it's hard to see how this new challenge changes this character. Also, he seems to take his predicament much better than you might think. The other flaw with the movie is with the climax. I won't reveal what happens, except it's somewhat hard to swallow everything that occurs. Don't get me wrong, the movie is still enjoyable despite these flaws. It's just not perfect - though when you think about it, very few movies are.",Null,3,4,30 January 2016
