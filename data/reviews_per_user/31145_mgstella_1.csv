Walk the Line," Question about songs
","I loved the movie and I loved the song that Reese and Joaquin sing together when Reese storms off stage. It goes something like: 'time's awastin' times awastin' let's go...' Can anyone tell me the title of the song and where I could find a recording of it? It is not on the soundtrack and I'm disappointed. On a sidenote, I love Reese's performance and thought Joaquin was a bit too sexy to be Johnny cash! I fell in love with the music even though I wasn't a fan beforehand. I have also seen Transamerica and can't help but think that Felicity Huffman had a harder job in trying to play a man play a transgendered person.",9,0,0,10 March 2006
