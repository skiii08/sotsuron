Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a bit underrated but still disappointing
","With some changes this movie could have been a great start to a trilogy but no, jar jar just ruined it.the movie starts off good but it really got boring towards the 3rd act, thankfully darth maul saved it from being terrible so give it a chance if you haven't, it's not the worst in the franchise but it's damn near close.",6,5,7,19 February 2019
Captain Marvel," Why! why now!
","This movie is such a disappointment and here i thought maybe just maybe the controversy and all the hating is wrong about it because similar to this i actually really loved the last jedi and that movie got a sh** tone of hate, but unfortunately i can't get behind this one, there was no character development for captain marvel and it's not just brie' fault, the story is boring and uninteresting too, it's just so unfortunate coming out of infinity war and now i'm worried about end game, i hope this doesn't damage the mcu because they were doing great with all this.",2,75,154,6 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Solid movie but kinda messy and rushed
",It's definitely not the worst in the series but as an ending to the entire saga it's a little disappointing and I always keep saying that the sequel trilogy is light years ahead of the prequels but now with this movie I feel like revenge of the sith was way more successful at ending the saga and I kinda knew jj would rush through the story and he clearly wasn't a big fan of the last jedi so this movie doesn't feel like a sequel to 8 so it's very disjointed as a whole but it still has a lot of cool moments specially the back half of movie and rey and kyloare easily the highlight of the movie and again like the force awakens not enough luke skywalker... if only anakin would have showed up in this movie I think it would become way better and it felt like a missed opportunity but overall it's not as bad as some angry star wars say it is.,6,1,10,29 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," the cringiest entry in the saga
","At least episode i had darth maul and qui gon but this one is just hilariously bad i mean the dialog between young anakin and padme, dear god what were you thinking george.but still i don't hate it it has some cool moments here and there but ultimately it's the worst episode in the saga and no it's not better than the last jedi.",5,3,4,19 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," flawed yet interesting
","This is probably the most hated star wars movie to date it's actually sad to see this much negativity around just this one movie, it's embarrassing because the movie is nowhere near as bad as what they say it is, the movie creates conflicts within us something that i've never witnessed in a star wars movie since the empire strikes back.it's not the best of franchise like i think the ending was very weak and it should not have been ended happily like that but it's the movie is the most interesting part of the sequels and it needs a good 20 to 30 years to be accepted by the fans and i don't mind if the franchise dies after ix because frankly we don't deserve another one and the fanboys want it to end right? so i guess we all finally get what we want.",8,9,49,4 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," surprisingly good
","Damn lucas, couldn't you just make something like this earlier, it almost looked like someone else has made it.the only big problem that i have with this movie is that it is a cji fest, even more than first two but i can look pass the dialog and writing in this movie because it's something you would expect from george lucas.",9,4,5,19 February 2019
