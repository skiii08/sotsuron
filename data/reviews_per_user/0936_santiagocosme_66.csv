Moneyball," Yes! a good sports movie.
","First of all, I am not a baseball fan, so I guess my opinion should count a little. In fact, I am not even aware of the rules of this sport. But you know what? I really enjoyed Moneyball. Being based on a true story, you just know that there has got to be a good enough reason for that story to be turned into a movie. In Moneyball, you don't get to see that much baseball action though, for it shows you the other side of the sport. You get to see the bureaucracy and the extent to which a GM needs to go to be able to compete with wealthier teams. His new approach when recruiting players make him a few enemies along the way, and the majority of his staff seems uninterested in helping him make a good run for the title. His only help (in fact the source of his inspiration) comes from a young economist from Yale who has zero experience in baseball, but both of them are about to embark on a journey that will change the history of baseball forever At least that's the impression I got. As a result, the movie is one of those that leave a long lasting feeling. Most of us will relate to the protagonist and feel that sometimes, all you need in adversity is to see things from a different perspective, especially when the big fish is way bigger than you",7,1,1,10 June 2015
Million Dollar Arm," Just what I expected. Just what I needed.
","You know, there are some days when you just need a simple movie to go through the motions. One of those that will forgive you checking your mobile phone or your Facebook while you watch it, because no matter how many times you disregard it, you will still be able to get back into the movie. Million dollar arm is exactly what I needed for my Sunday evening, when my mind was already thinking about my next day at work. A sports agent (Jon Ham) is on the edge of going out of business but he has a big idea: he will go to India to find talented kids, who can pitch like a National baseball league player as part of the 'Million dollar arm' campaign. Everything goes from bad to worse, as you would expect, but after going around the country for days or weeks, he finally comes across two boys who seem to have what it takes. Neither of them has ever played baseball or any sports alike but Jon Ham takes them to the USA regardless. They will spend the following months learning how to play baseball for a trial in front of professional teams at the end of it. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity for them to leave their old life behind once and for all, to make the billions of Indians who are following them proud, and to save Jon Ham from a hopeless future.It's not hard to imagine the clichés you will encounter in this movie: the man that is old but still has the best eye (or ear in this case) for spotting talent, the girl next door who is sweet and kind and makes Jon ham more human, the stereotypes about Indians, etc I was hoping also for a moment of fist pumping at some stage but I never saw it. Maybe the greatest moment of the movie caught looking at my phone. Either way, a nice enough movie to watch on a Sunday when you are bored and feel lazy.",5,1,1,15 December 2014
10 Cloverfield Lane," Positively surprised.
","I was honestly expecting one of the worst movie experiences of the year, but I have to admit 10 Cloverfield Lane did surprise me quite a bit. In a positive way. A girl escapes her house, and after a car crash where she loses control of her car, she wakes up locked in a basement where a man claims that the world is under attack. Terrified by her apparent kidnap, she desperately tries to find a way to escape, but she soon realizes that the man who is locking here in the house might actually be telling the truth about what is going on out there. 10 clover field lane is entertaining because you are never too sure about which way the movie will head. You'd like to think that the guy who kidnaps the girl is a psychopath, but then you are made to think he's not, then you think he is, then you think he's not. I guess, you will need to see the movie till the end to know who is evil and who is not in this movie. Not necessarily a must watch movie, but entertaining enough.",7,1,4,17 May 2016
The Equalizer," Equal to other movies of this genre.
","Equalizer is your typical story of a retired agent who is hiding from his past and now leads a quiet life working in some petty job away from all the action. As you always get in this sort of movies, no one suspects who he really is/was. He keeps to himself, he is methodical, he leaves alone and his wife broke his heart. I bet you have heard this plot before! Anyway, some day, as he spends yet another night at a bar reading books, he befriends a young girl called Alina who works as a hooker and seems to be abused by her pimp. He decides to take care of business like in the good old days and kills four guys with a style reminiscent of Jason Bourne or James Bond at his best. (I consider Denzel Washington a fantastic actor; one of the best, but personally, I feel he is starting to look a little old for this type of action roles).Can you imagine the rest? I bet you can! Those four guys he just killed belong to a huge Russian mafia clan (no evil character cannot speak without a funny accent), and they are on their way to the US to get rid of our hero. And what does an action hero do in these cases? You probably know, because it's just like another million movies you have seen before: he takes them on on his own! I guess you get my point: the movie doesn't feel like anything new. However, it's still executed well enough to be enjoyable, and Denzel Washington is great! So if you feel like watching a movie before going to bed, why not? There's a lot worse out there!",5,3,6,18 December 2014
Source Code," Jake Gylenhall again!
","I am such a big fan of this guy's movies. When was the last time I watched a movie that Jake featured and wasn't good? I cannot remember. Although 'Source Code' is not my favorite, i found it to be really entertaining. In this film, Jake Gyllenhaal is a soldier that wakes up in someone else's body and through an experiment by the government, he has got 8 minutes to find the bomber in a train. When the bomb goes off and Stevens finds himself in the pod again. He is sent back another time, yet still cannot find out anything. This sequence is repeated over and over again, until he is able to complete the mission, cause if he does, he is in in fact, changing the reality of today. A little bit like what happens in back to the future 2. The movie has tension, drama, and has an uncertain ending. All of it make for a movie that may not have you on the edge of your seat, but that is intense enough to make you alert until the end.",7,0,0,10 December 2016
Friday Night Lights," Not the most memorable movie.
","I am writing this review about 3 weeks after I actually watched the movie. Guess what? I had to re-read the storyline on IMDb to make sure I remembered what this movie was about. Even when looking at some of the frames, I have a very hard time remembering something about it. I guess my inability to write something about Friday night lights is the perfect proof of how this movie lacks any character or anything that would make it mildly memorable. I guess being a sports movie, you can still watch it on a Sunday afternoon and be OK about it. But surely, it will not make it into your top 100. There's better movies about sports and much better ones about American Football. Try Rudy instead. Only my modest opinion.",5,0,2,17 May 2016
John Wick," Same old rubbish.
","I recently wrote a review for 'Equalizer'. In that review I complained about encountering the same old clichés over and over again in action movies. Clichés that you will find in John Wick: a mysterious protagonist who has lost his wife in unknown circumstances to the viewer, the bad guys who always happen to be Russians and/or speak with a funny accent, and obviously, the protagonist being capable of taking on an army of killers as if they were Playmobile figurines. No need to say, that even though he finds himself in the most stressful situations, he's always calm enough to use sarcasm when he speaks, have perfect hair after every battle, and even have a few ladies fall in love in the process. And all the troubles and the hundreds of killings (yes Keanu Reeves kills more people in an hour that in the Matrix trilogy) over a stolen car and the killing of a puppy! I jest! Anyway, enough with my own dose of sarcasm. There's only three words to describe this stereotypical action-packed-I-have-seen-it-all-before-movie: boring, boring, boring. But I guess that since it still manages a surprisingly high 7.3 rating, my opinion is only shared by a few. So watch it at your own peril, and whether you like it or not, tell me if anything I say here is untrue!",3,3,16,24 January 2015
Fury," A little cliché and predictable for my taste.
","Fury is another one of the many WW2 films out there. It is an OK movie. Just as much as most action packed movies in which the Nazis get what they deserved. However, the one thing that annoyed me is that the characters were so typical in their personality, I guessed who would survived at the end about 20 minutes into the movie. Yes! That's right! And I am normally not that good at guessing endings. Who do we have? Brad Pitt plays the cool guy who always seems to know what to do and how to do it. The Leader. The guy who keeps his soldiers in check. The one that inspires them to fight and be better men when they feel like faltering. As we so often see in movies of this genre, the leader is ALWAYS accompanied by a guy who behaves like a wild beast, another guy that seems more intellectual than the others, a Latin who is retarded, and and and a very weak guy who the leader needs to take under his wing. This guy does not want to fight or to kill anyone. He throws up at the sight of dead bodies. He cries and weeps like a baby. But guess who at the end will show courage beyond belief all of a sudden and inspire his fellow soldiers to show bravery too .I bet you guessed! The weakest link! And who will be the only one making it alive? I bet you guessed who because, it's always the same thing. One other thing that is common in absolutely all the WW2 is the following: if we look back, and we try to be a little fair, the Nazis lost because they went to war with all the countries around them. I mean the whole world was against them. So you could easily say that they lost because of being completely outnumbered. War for them was plainly unsustainable. However, in every single American movie, there's always a scene in which a squad of about 5 to 6 US army soldiers decides to take on a full unit of hundreds of SS soldiers instead of retreating. All of a sudden, the Nazis seem to be the biggest army And guess what happens when 5 us soldiers take on 300 Germans. Yes, I bet you guessed what happens. One would think, that it took about 1000 soldiers to defeat the German War machine. If you are not bothered by this type of clichés (I watch about 4 movies a week so I am really fussy), you will find Fury a good enjoyable movie. But if you are like me, a movie geek, it really feels like you can guess the coming scenes even before they have started. Everyone feels differently about each movie. My opinion: Fury is OK but really nothing special.",5,16,33,7 April 2015
The Maze Runner," We don't need another one of these.
","I think when it comes to considering watching this movie you have to ask yourself a couple of questions: Am I an adult? Am I really into cinema?If you answered yes to either of these questions, or even more so, if you answered yes to both of them, you should honestly stay away from this. Unlike, some of the reviews I have read, I don't think the acting is particularly bad. The actors only do what they are requested by a script that honestly, didn't take years of brain picking. The film will remind you of hunger games, and other similar movies that seem to hook most teenagers and the sort of people who think Harry Potter or Lord Of the Rings are the best movies ever. And they are many out there... I am a fan of Haneke, Faith Hakin, Denis Villeneuve, Wong Kar Wai, Kim Ki Duk, and surely, the problem is that I should stick to my kind of cinema. It makes no sense watching this. Somehow though, I try to watch a movie a day, and when I read the plot I thought, it sounds interesting. 10 minutes into the movie, I knew it was 'one of those'. When it's not for you, it's not for you!",2,2,4,6 December 2014
42," An OK movie based on real events.
","Real event movies always work let's face it. Whether they are a TV movie or a big production, there's always something enjoyable about taking a peek at history. In this case, the dark years of American history are dismantled and we take a look at how much Black people suffered in the past, through the eyes of the very first colored man to play in the baseball league. A man whose unquestionable courage helped him reshape part of the history of this sport, while becoming an icon of the fight against race injustice. The movie itself is not the most entertaining, but I doubt that anyone will not be interested in seeing this through and knowing more about Jackie Robinson. I am not a baseball fan, I have never watched a game, and still I am happy I did watch the movie.",6,2,3,11 June 2015
The Danish Girl," Mehhhh
","The acting is brilliant. No question. It is so good that the guy deserved an Oscar for it. As for the story itself, the subject is so far away from what I like that it never felt really entertaining. The story of a Danish painter who is married to a lovely woman painter and poses for her one day so she can finish a painting about a ballerina. The ballerina being unavailable, she asks her husband to dress as a woman. What the husband experiences is indescribable unless you have had some transvestite interests, but the point is that what he feels right there is life changing. For him, being dressed as a woman is what he loves, and he feels that he is a woman trapped in a man's body. A woman that he will call Lily. What starts as a silly playful act turns out to be something that brings unhappiness to the couple, as the wife fights for her husband to stop dressing as a woman. Unfortunately, everything escalates to the point where her husband and Lily become two different people of whom Lilly has more possibilities of surviving.",6,0,1,10 December 2016
Superbad," What was the movie about?
","You see, this is what happens when you watch a bad movie and you do not write a review straight away. I watched Superbad a couple of weeks ago and have been wanting to write about since. I am now desperately trying to remember what the movie was about and I seriously have no idea what I watched. I suppose that it is enough to make a point about the quality of the movie. It may well be the least memorable movie I ever watched or surely one of them. I am obviously finding it extremely difficult to write and finish this review. The 10 lines that are required of me from IMDb seem like an almost impossible task to complete. I may as well talk about the weather in Madrid. Today was a lovely day, nice and mild with a lovely sun baking the Manzanares river in the morning. Perfect for a walk, and perfect to forget movies such as superbad. I am sure it has been said before, but the title of the movie couldn't fit the quality of the movie any better. Superbad is indeed superbad.",2,1,5,10 December 2016
Creed," Rocky 7: Not!
","This is Creed ladies and gentlemen. This is not Rocky 7! And you want to know why? because, even though Rocky Balboa is in the movie, even though he is somehow connected to boxing, for the first time, common sense has struck him, and he finally has decided to hang up his gloves for good. That's right, you will not see Rocky fighting anyone! Thanks God!So I will go as far as to say that Creed deserves credit on its own, but as a sequel of the sequel of the sequel, it is to me the best since Rocky 2. Clearly!! Some elements will remind of the original Rocky, and the movie still feels down to earth enough and believable, so if they decide to make a Creed 2 or Rocky 8, I will go watch it. Damn right!",7,0,2,14 February 2016
Spotlight," True story with good actors. That's it, that's all.
","I am writing this review about a week after watching the movie, and I must admit I have trouble remembering what it is about. Oh yeah!! cases of sexual abuse conducted by the Church for decades and that no one in Boston ever cared to unfold, until a newspaper chief editor decides that it is time that someone takes the matter seriously. The movie has a lot of indoor scenes and a lot of conversation, which makes you think they would have no trouble turning it into a theater piece. The movie is nominated to the Oscars and that always puts a bit of extra pressure on it. After watching it, I don't feel it deserves an Oscar. However, it's full of good actors, it's a social case, a true story, and it's for all audiences.These elements are normally appreciated by the jury. So, can it win and steal the accolades? who knows? If it was in my hands, it would not even be a nomination. Still very watchable.",6,1,4,14 February 2016
Don Jon," Don Don Don't you ever make a movie like this again.
","I could try to find positives about this movie, but that would be the fakest/phoniest review ever. First off, I'm sorry to say, and I might get hatred messages from teenagers, but if you pick an actor to play the role of a lady killer, a guy that sleeps with the absolute hottest girls right, left and center, you shouldn't get JGL. He is just not good looking enough in my books to look the part. Second, what's this thing about Scarlett Johansson looking like a slut, but then she behaves like she would not have sex with the guy in weeks? Something is a little off about that character in my opinion. Third. JGL's family is Italian. Why do Italians always speak with that fake and exaggerated accent in movies? Why are they always portrayed having lunch together while men wear white tank tops? Why does the father always speaks loud, watches football and seems incapable of helping around the house? And why do they always spend every Sunday at the church? Cause you see, I have met loads of Italians and I'm still to meet one that acts or looks like that in real life. Fourh, who the hell is that older lady who spends the whole movie crying and just seems to look for a conversation with JGL anytime they come across each other, although they have nothing in common? oh waitthey actually get on really well.I'll save myself the time to write points five, six, or seventy nine, cause seriously it won't matter. I simply have no idea who could watch this movie and feel like they had a good time. It's absolutely pointless, it's all over the place, and simply atrocious. If I were you, I'd watch the 24 news channel. It's way more entertaining.",1,2,7,4 January 2015
Zodiac," What the hell happened?
","Being a big fan of TV series such as Crime Mysteries, I was already aware of quite a few things about the story of Zodiac. In fact, if I am not wrong there have been several different ones over the course of the last 30 years. In this case, the police is trying to capture a suspect who is killing random people and then calling the Newspapers to admit his guilt. Even though, the police seems to get closer and closer to the person who did it, they never have enough ammunition to make anyone face justice. As time passes by, the police gets desperate, the newspapers lose interest, and only a guy who draws for a column continues to find the murderer. Did he ever get to him? Only by watching the movie will you find out. It is slow at times, and you don't really understand why they feel the need to tell that this scene or the other happened 'one day later' or 'two days later', but apart from this little details, Zodiac is a good movie to watch by my standards.",7,0,0,25 May 2016
Begin Again," For the love of music.
","I don't love movies that are about music bands. I always get bored of all the scenes where a supposed artist is on stage singing a song to the masses and everybody sings along as if it was a hit, but the song is absolute rubbish. That in itself is enough for me to stop watching a movie. Surprisingly enough, in this movie, they a did a pretty good job with the songwriting. Some of the songs are quite enjoyable, and they make the story a little more believable. But hold on! What story? A girl who gets dumped by her emerging star boyfriend meets an exec guy from the music industry who falls in love with her singing. And they both spend the whole movie recording her songs around NY city to release an album at the end. That's it....if anything else happened, please let me know.I normally take points away for the music, in this case I give points for it. Without the music it would be a 4...",6,18,31,15 December 2014
The Doors," If it wasn't for the soundtrack...
","First off, this review comes about 20 years too late. Yep! That's how much time has passed since this movie was released. At the time, Val Kilmer was actually popular. I wonder how many teenagers have actually heard of him now The Doors is one of my favorite bands of all time, and the opening song of the movie, Riders on the storm still remains my favorite song. So, when the movie started with this tune, I really thought there could not be a better start. Regrettably, everything was less and less interesting after that. I get that Jim Morrison was a unique, crazy, and incomprehensible person. A man who seemed to lead a life with one only goal: to find death sooner rather than later. But not being able to understand this man doesn't mean that I should not be able to make sense of the movie. Yes, we get to see what Jim Morrison was probably like. But the movie is called 'The Doors', and I would have wanted to find out a lot more about the other members of the band who were also unique musicians. They composed one of the greatest albums in the history of music in 6 days, and that part of their story, is what I really wanted to hear about. Unfortunately, Oliver Stone thought that dedicating 6 minutes to this subject was more than enough. Shame!As a Doors fan, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the concert parts and listening to what is obviously an amazing soundtrack, but as for the story telling, I thought it was mediocre at best. There's a reason why this movie is completely forgotten. Because, it just wasn't good enough.",5,0,0,15 March 2015
Black Mass," Finally Depp does something a little different.
","I am well aware of the cult status of Johnny Depp and the millions of fans he has around the world, but honestly, I was well tired of his Captain adventures and Burtonesque characters. The moment I saw his face with a balding head and grey hair, I thought: let's give this a chance. And it proved a great thing to do.We all have seen mafia movies many times, and this in a way doesn't bring anything too new to that list. Turns out, you sort of expect the all too familiar spaghetti dinners, shots in the back of the head, and a police department that is more corrupt than you could imagine. Still, these elements always work. If they didn't, they would not continue to make movies out of it. Let's make some more really, I still enjoy them, especially if based on real events.",7,1,2,14 February 2016
Interstellar," Pretty good. But not that good.
","I could not wait to find a cinema that showed this movie, especially after two of my close friends went as far as to saying that it was beyond a doubt one of the best movies of all time. Honestly, I don't think it's the case. It will be one of the top movies of the year but that's about it. Christopher Nolan seems to feel the need to explain to us every single thing that happens, every step of the way so we don't get lost. It becomes a little annoying as the movie progresses. Another thing that makes this movie lose a couple of points is that hippie conversation around the half way point, where Anne Hathaway says something along the lines of 'nothing is more powerful than love'. Please! Get serious! On the positive side, the last few minutes of the movie are quite spectacular visually. Probably better than Gravity. All in all, considering the type of movies that get done these days, Interstellar is definitely one to watch.",7,3,6,22 November 2014
American Sniper," Hold on till the end
","I must admit that the first hour and a half was a bit of a pain, and I really wasn't getting into the groove of watching the movie. I felt bored and I kept looking at my watch. For me it was just another American movie who glorifies their soldiers who are sent to foreign countries to eradicate evil from the planet. A typical American film where their soldiers are portrayed to being just and honorable under any circumstance. Yes, you could say this is not totally true as Bradley Cooper is seen shooting kids several times, which is hardly a honorable thing to do. But even then, the director manages to make the Afghans look more evil than Americans when one of their leaders kidnaps a kid and puts a drill through his head to kill him. Pretty graphic I must say. The thing is that after that hour and a half, Bradley Cooper finally comes home. Unfortunately, the war has taken a toll on him. It's hard to say whether or not he is mentally deranged, but you feel his family is not completely safe around him. For me, the last few minutes were the interesting ones (along with a few minutes where you see the ability of the Sniper in the battlefield).Without the last half and hour, I don't think I would have rated the movie with more than a 5. But since it managed to make me feel emotional at the end, I have to give it a 7, which I think is about right overall. Enjoy!",7,1,7,1 May 2015
Southpaw," How disappointing!
","I should blame the power of marketing for the disproportionate buzz this movie has created. I gave my friends a hard time, and continued relentlessly in my pursuit to convince them that this was the movie we had to watch. Being stubborn bordering pain in the backside, my friends decided to accompany me to watch SouthPaw. There we were, a mixed group of girls and guys in their thirties happily watching this movie together on a big screen. But how bad did I feel about my friends throughout the movie? I had pushed them to spend two hours watching one of the most overrated and boring movies of the year. Furthermore, on a Saturday night when the streets of Madrid are hustling and buzzing and people are in terraces enjoying the sun and sipping cocktails. I honestly find it hard to come up with positives about this film. It follows the typical recipe to make a sports movie: A guy is the champ; he then loses everything or gets injured; he hits rock bottom; he starts training again; he regains his title. That's it. There's nothing unpredictable in Southpaw. It follows the same pattern that you may have seen a million times. To finish, I'll say that I consider Gyllenhaall one of my favorite actors, and I pointed in another review how I enjoyed all his movies. Well, I guess this is the exception that confirms the rule, because Southpaw is clearly not a movie that I wish to recommend. Mediocre at best!",4,5,10,30 August 2015
Nightcrawler," With Jake Gyllenhaal you never go wrong.
","Honestly, I can't remember a movie with Jake Gyllenhaal which I disliked. Every movie which features him seems to be entertaining and often memorable. From the days of Donnie Darko, to Enemy (the last one I saw) and now Nightcrawler. In this movie, Jake Gyllenhaal is a loner who just doesn't seem to be able to get a job despite all his efforts. One night, as he is probably driving home, he sees a camera crew filming a fatal car crash and quickly selling the footage to some news channel. Mesmerized by what he just witnessed, he goes to a pawn shop the next day where he buys a video camera and a police scanner to track incidents. From then on, he will be driving the streets of LA on a hunt for the most unique footage. What starts as a way to make money, quickly spirals into a crazy obsession for the protagonist. And that's exactly what the movie is about: the transformation of a man who goes from being a lost cause to a completely different beast the moment he finds something that gives his life some direction. Sadly, as it often happens in the real world, the new him will have no hesitation in crushing everything that comes his way to make it to the top. As a spectator, you rub your hands while trying to imagine how far he will go. But apart from the adventures of our protagonist, what I liked about the movie is how the director depicts the unknown world of media in a way that feels surrealistic but true. You can't help but wonder if the movie is in fact closer to reality than you'd like to think and the world of communications is as obscure as you are shown. This enigma still got me thinking about the movie two days after I actually watched it. That in itself is a clear sign I got what I paid for. I do not often say this, but I will definitely re- watch the movie at some point. Personally, I highly recommend it.",8,1,1,1 January 2015
Radio," Lovely family movie/story.
","This movie reminded me enormously of a British flick called Marvelous which was beyond a doubt one of my favorites of 2015. Radio is the name given to a black kid who seems a little mentally retarded and walks around town pushing a shopping cart full of things that he collects. One day, he intercepts a football and decides to keep it instead of returning it to the team who was playing with it. Trouble starts for Radio when the team decides to retaliate and teach him a lesson. However, the team's manager is not happy about how his team handles the situation and decides to take Radio under his wing. Little by little, Radio starts to become an icon of the team, and of the high school itself. A new life starts for him under the tutelage of his new found friend. Not everything will be a piece of cake as many students will see Radio as nothing else but a buffoon to make fun of",7,1,1,24 November 2016
The Revenant," A cold movie.
","The highly appraised and one of the Oscars' favorite left me as cold as the landscape you see throughout. The big question that everyone will be asking themselves is: will Leonardo Di Caprio finally win an Oscar? On the evidence of this performance he shouldn't. For the second year in succession, Eddie Redmayne has to be the favorite to win the statue. As for the movie, I think it will fall short of an Oscar too, but it's hard to see which one deserves it more than the Revenant. The bridge of spies would be the other favorite in my eyes, but it does not feel like an Oscar worthy movie. It's hard to tell really, and maybe irrelevant anyway. The point is that The Revenant is a magnificent movie from the point of view of the photography, and I can only imagine the nightmare it must have been to record such a movie in absolute freezing conditions. But in the end, what matters is the emotions you feel when you watch it, and in that department it left completely uninspired. I understand that some people will like it a lot, but to me, it lacks punch and substance. Leonardo Di Caprio was probably crippled a little too long to make it really entertaining.",6,1,3,14 February 2016
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Simple comedy
","You don't need to be a scientist to know what you will find in a movie such as '40 year old virgin'. A miserable man who goes through with nothing more than his job to keep him busy. During a poker game, his friends find out that he is virgin and they all go on a quest to help him overcome this situation. He goes through training, expert tips, he waxes his chest, and in everything he does the outcome is always mostly on the funny side. A movie like this is nothing more than a quick fix if you have nothing to do, or if you are in a super good mood and you feel that anything will make you laugh. Everything away from these two states of mind will make you feel as if you are being tortured by the worst possible crew of movie makers put together. Will they make you laugh? Not really? will you smile? maybe? Does it deserve your time? probably not.",4,1,2,10 December 2016
Inside Out," I'm 38, but too childish to enjoy this adult movie!
","If I had watched this movie when I was 5-10, I would have probably understood none about Inside Out. I get that Pixar movies are getting more and more complicated with new generations getting brighter and cleverer, but I think this pushes the limit too far. Maybe, it's simply intentional. Disney must have realized that a big chunk of their fans are actually adults (I did not see one kid at the cinema for this movie), and the stories are adapted to please them.Either way, I can only judge for what it made me feel, and honestly, it didn't do much for me. I laughed more at the images in the final credits than I did during the entire movie. Whilst the intention of the movie is absolutely superb, and I gotta give credit to whoever came up with the idea, the actual truth is that I found myself looking at my watch and even thinking of leaving at one stage. Never, ever, have I felt that way with a Pixar movie. I don't get it!! Everyone seems to be raving about this movie, and I just did not care one bit about it. Shame. Maybe I should stick to more childish Disney movies from the good old days.",5,10,39,14 September 2015
Remember the Titans," It's not over until I win.
","That was the spirit of the Coach that led this college team of football players to defy the social stigmas of the time, and to successfully manage the first mix-raced team in the country. It's an eye opener to see that this happened only 2 or 3 decades ago when these days you are more than accustomed to images of teams full of players of every social background. The movie was not so much about the winning than it was about the journey, and as a journey it was an enjoyable one to watch. Also, it's worth mentioning that Denzel Washington is excellent once again and makes every role feel dead simple to him. Whether he is a coach, a lawyer, or corrupt cop, he just nails it every time. Not sure I will watch this movie gain, but it has motivated me to watch more of the same genre. Invincible is next!",6,1,3,21 February 2016
Foxcatcher," Bizarre. Strange. Weird. And Slow. Very slow.
","A bizarre story based on very bizarre events. An Olympic champion called Mark Schultz dedicates every hour of his days to wrestling, and trains with his brother with his sights on becoming World Champion. However, he receives an unusual phone call from a millionaire called Du Pont who flies him to his house and offers to sponsor his training for the future. While it would not take a scientist to see that this rich guy is completely out of his mind, Mark Schultz who probably wants to do things his own way and stand out of his brother's shadow accepts the offer and moves in with Du Pont. The partnership of these two men leads to unlikely events.While I am pretty interested in fighting in general, I have to say that to me, the movie felt extremely slow paced, and it made me wonder throughout if the story was actually good enough to turn it into a film. While the performances of the actors are all fantastic, I don't think this deserves some of the praising reviews I have read. Nothing really happens in this movie, apart from seeing many strong grown men training and accommodating the stupid and eccentric needs of a lonely and retarded millionaire. By IMDb standards, a movie with a 7.4 rating is sort of OK to watch, and that's exactly what this is: just another movie",5,3,11,19 January 2015
It Follows," Started well but got progressively bad.
","I have to admit that I am not really into the horror movie genre even when it's cleverly done. In fact, I cannot remember the last movie of this type I thoroughly enjoyed. This is why I was so nicely surprised when I found myself totally hooked by 'It follows' a few minutes into the movie. But the thing is that it's not enough to have a decent idea. It's equally important to know what to do with it. And I have the feeling that the scriptwriter did not really know where this was going. I am not going to spoil you the end or the intermediate part. I'll just say that the movie loses character as it progresses and the ending is disappointing to say the least. Still, I'd give it the thumbs up for a Sunday watch, and if you need an excuse to get your girl under the blanket for a hug.",6,3,39,7 June 2015
Gone Girl," Great movie ruined by terrible ending.
","At the time of watching this movie, it had a rating of 8.4 on IMDb. I normally trust that whatever movie has an 8.0 rate or more should definitely be a great film. Well, I hope this is the exception that confirms the rule, because this movie might be one of the worst I have ever seen. Why? you must be wondering. Because of the last 30 minutes. Up until that point I was really enjoying it, generally speaking. But man, that ending is appalling, utterly atrocious, and plainly nonsensical! A great thriller turned into a love story of pathetic proportions in a matter of minutes. The only positive i found at the end was the way they portray the power of media and public opinion in society. The rest should go down the garbage shoot.In these types of movies, there's only one premise: keep it real. If you do, you'll have a great film, which will improve with every twist and turn you add. If you don't keep it real, and your thriller becomes too surrealistic, you'll find yourself going from cleverness and brilliance to false cleverness and stupidity. And that's exactly what happened in this film in the last half hour. Seriously, who in their right mind can believe that sequence of events at the end?It had great potential, but it is surely one that I will remember for the wrong reasons.",1,25,45,19 December 2014
The Theory of Everything," Beautiful Mind (Part 2)
","As you just read above, the movie is no different from those movies you may have seen before about geniuses crippled by some illness. The fact that it's nothing new (IMO) doesn't make the movie a bad one to watch. I would still highly recommend it.The main interest for me was to find out about this brilliant man who I had always seen in a wheelchair. I had no idea about how he came to be in that situation. I also had no idea that he was able to make two wonderful woman fall in love with him.The director makes a good job, and manages to make you cry and laugh, which is what every movie aims to do. All in all, it's a movie worth watching, and although it will not remain in your mind forever, the story of Stephen Hawking surely will.",6,4,7,2 December 2014
Frozen," Disney like in the old days.
","I am not a fan of every Disney movie but, for Christmas, watching one felt like the right thing to do. So having been recommended Frozen, I decided to give it a go.Personally, I didn't really get into it that much. There was far too much singing in the first few minutes and that put me off from the word go. The story has a certain resemblance with movies such as 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Sleeping Beauty' where an act of pure love is the answer to all evil. I guess Frozen is a good old fashion Disney movie with the latest animation possibilities of today's time. But here's the thing, I no longer watch these movies to be blown away by their production skills. I watch them because sometimes they are extremely entertaining, and this one felt a little boring to me.Still, if you are to watch this film with a youngish crowd, I would recommend it as a good option.",5,3,10,24 December 2014
Peaceful Warrior," Inspired by the Quotes, not so much by the movie.
","Peaceful Warrior is a small production or at least it feels like it. The story of a young gymnast who has it all but is empty inside. He comes across a man called Socrates who becomes his spiritual healer and opens his eyes about the true meaning of life. The movie is plagued with metaphorical scenes, so much that it's hard to know if this Socrates is for real or just a product of the gymnast' s imagination. Although, I am not a fan of metaphors in movies, ads, etcÂ… I accepted them as part of the visual explanation of life that is often simple but difficult to explain.What I loved the most are the quotes and some of the teachings you get from the movie. 'What are you? this moment.' will remain in my notebook for a long long time.",8,0,1,21 February 2016
Room," Gripping!
","What a touching movie. I had to force myself to watch it, as the thought of going through a story about a mother and her son trapped inside a small room for years was too claustrophobic and had too little room (no pun intended) for excitement. But I am glad I watched it. It's a gripping movie. The story of a girl who gets kidnapped and locked in a 10 sqm2 room for 7 years. She gets pregnant and has a son who believes their 'room' is the only real thing in the world. When he turns five, she finally tries to explain to him the reality of their lives, and together, they need to find a way to escape. I am not sure whether this movie was anywhere the Oscar nominations or not, but either it is a movie that I hope people will watch. It deserves it. Way better than 90% of the flicks you have out there.",8,2,4,26 March 2016
Ex Machina," A good movie. No question.
","I decided to watch X Machina as it was the only movie that everyone around me was constantly recommending in the last . So I guess you could say that the expectations were high. The story unfolds in a huge country house where a scientist has taken Artificial intelligence to a new level, and creates absolutely perfect looking girls who he gets intimate with. In order to test how perfect his creations really are, he decides to have a guest at his house for a week: a computer programmer whose sole mission is to interact with one of the girls. Only this chap starts to develop a certain liking for herI thought the acting was good, but I would like to praise the casting director for such a fantastic job. The scientist is perfect in the role of someone that you should dislike without going for the freaky looking actors you often come across with in similar roles. And the programmer looks like a nerd, but not to the point of being a cliché. He also shows typical signs of a weak personality, which you know is a set up by the director who by the end will turn him into a despicable machine. Overall, a good watch. I recommend it, although not as highly as my friends did since I found it a little predictable.",7,2,5,5 June 2015
Sing Street," Sing to change your life.
","You might be a loner, an outsider, and a laughing stock, but if you can sing and compose songs, you can turn your life around and even steal the heart (or almost) of the girl you like who is older than you and dates more mature guys. This is more of less the story of Sing Street. The whole movie includes a lot of singing, and is a step away from being a musical. Surprisingly enough, the songs which are often rubbish in this kind of production were actually enjoyable. In general, I must admit that I kind of liked the movie. Not my favorite by any means but just good enough to recommend it to a youngish crowd. Still, if you are into movies where music is kind of the key element, there are better options out there. The Boat that rocked and Begin Again are two good examples.",6,0,1,24 November 2016
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," You can't better a good book!
","The subject of WW2 always seems to work. The bad and evil Germans against the world! Add the innocence of kids into the equation and you should be able to come up with a decent enough story. The book was indeed very enjoyable. The movie not so much.The look and feel is pretty lame. Everything is far too neat, from the costumes, to the decorations, and the dialogs. It feels as though the characters are robots and stripped of any human traits. No, it has got nothing to do with portraying the Nazis! the kids are just as lame! To keep it short, i'd say: if you have read the book, do not bother watching this. If you haven't, you may enjoy it as it's a fresh approach to the Nazis subject...",5,1,2,2 December 2014
The Imitation Game," A brilliant movie!
","After so many years, people still manage to find ideas or stories to tell about the second world war that feel fresh and entertaining. I watched the imitation game with a complete lack of information about anything surrounding the life of its protagonist. I had never heard of Alan Turing or his life. Of course, the fact that governments kept his achievements secret for over 50 years has a lot to do with very few people knowing about his existence. This is why, even if posthumously, true justice was made by creating this film, and this great man can now receive the praise that he so rightfully deserves. The entire movie is created, as it should, with an non-ending set of tense situations and moments. Alan Turing is a brilliant man who is hired to end the war but he has no one to help him. In fact, the very people who hire him are the ones trying to get rid of him; in a world dominated by men, his greatest help comes from a girl; but her parents do not accept where she works, so to not see her go, Alan Turing gets engaged with her. But surprise surprise, he is homosexual. Everything, absolutely everything in the movie is done in such a way for you to be kept wondering. I guess the director probably added a lot of content to the actual facts and did not follow the original story to a tee. But in cases like this, when the movie is so entertaining, I accept a little invention. All in all, a highly recommended movie, full of beautiful images, great acting, and a great real story! What else can you ask for?",9,3,8,21 March 2015
The Hangover Part II," Repetitive but funny!
","It's been a few years now since I watched the first part of this movie, but I still have the memories of how much it did make me laugh. I also remember that although most of it was unthinkable in real life, it did not get to a point of idiocy that turned you against the movie. They did manage to live in that fine line where you still accept what you are watching. In the sequel, that line was slightly crossed. On top of that, you have to feel a little disappointed about finding some replays of the elements that made you laugh in the first movie. I always take points away when I see a director that copies himself. A few examples: Stu loses a tooth in the first movie, in the second one he gets a tattoo on his face. Stu gets married to whore, in the second one he has sex with a transsexual. In the first movie they had a Lion, in the second they have a monkey; the bearded guy 'masturbates' a baby, here he masturbates an old man. And again in both of them, they get involved against some underworld guys. But make no mistake, I know I have not concentrated much on the positives of the movie so far, when the only thing that counts is how much it makes you laugh. And the truth is, I did laugh quite a few times and had a good time watching it. So bring on Hangover 3.",6,0,0,27 October 2015
Rudy," Inspirational
","No matter how small you are, how much of an outsider you might appear to be, even to your own family, if you have a dream and you really fight for it, with all that you have, ignoring all the setbacks and people that try to talk you out of it, you will reach your goal. This is essentially what the story of this movie will tell you and in a way make you believe. More than any other movie I ever watched before, Rudy is the perfect example to illustrate a quote that I heard a motivational speaker mention once: 'We are all self-made but only the successful will admit it'. Rudy truly is a self-made successful guy. Against all the odds, he became the player of the Notre Dame team when he wasn't even tall enough to reach the kitchen cabinet. More than ever before I believe that my dream is possible!",8,0,0,17 May 2016
Everest," Tough to watch
","There are two types of movies that I don't like. Movies that take place on a plane, and movies that unfold in mountains or frozen lands. No need to say that I was destined to dislike Everest. Well, surprise surprise. I didn't. I actually quite liked it. I think Everest is a good movie, that wins points also for being a movie based on real events. Everest makes you wonder what pushes men and women to put themselves through the need to walk the highest and most demanding mountain on earth, especially knowing that too many of them do not survive this crazy adventure. The movie tells the story of a group that decides to go up the mountain when bad weather is approaching. Bad management and a surprisingly awful storm traps many of the mountaineers. A mix of survival knowledge, luck and perseverance will be needed to go through the toughness of what lies ahead. Will they all make it? You'll need to watch the movie to find out.",7,3,5,10 December 2016
Woman in Gold," Nice story, decent film.
","I watched it, I payed attention to it, I wanted to know the outcome, but I never really got excited by this movie. Don't get me wrong, it is more than watchable, I just found it a little slow and unstimulating even though the protagonists were fighting for a painting worth over $100 million. Maybe it was due to the annoying posh mannerisms of the lady, maybe the lawyer lacked real charisma, or it was the constant back and forth to the past filled with Nazi imagery (I am starting to get tired of Nazi/Jew related movies. There are just too many...) Or maybe, it's just me who just felt unconnected with too many elements from this movie. In any case, I am aware that It's a nice story to know, so even though my review is on the negative side, I kind of feel happy I didn't waste my time on another offer.",6,3,4,6 September 2015
Invincible," Good inspirational movie.
","When the hard times come, and they are gonna come in truckloads, what can you do? just try to fight them and find a way to get back up. This is the story of a man who struggles to make ends meet, who is abandoned by his wife, and at the age of 30 is still asking his dad for money. He hangs around a pub with his jobless friends, and plays backyard football with them for which he seems to be better than any. One day, a call is made by the city's football team. They are looking for new players and are willing to give a chance to anyone to do a trial. And guess what, the protagonist makes it to the team!! A true story. Vincent Papale is his name. If you are looking for a Rockyesque type of movie, the type where an average man makes it to the top out of the blue and inspires a generation, this is it.",6,0,0,21 February 2016
Love & Mercy," Eye opening movie!
","I have always been a fan of the Beach Boys, although I wasn't even born when their music was rocking the world. So, apart from their songs, I have to admit I knew very little about the life of its band members. This is what I liked about 'Love & Mercy': it helped me discover the struggles of Brian Wilson, and his natural genius. On the other hand, I find it hard to tell if I liked the movie because of the story or because it is a good movie. It's always difficult when a film is based on true events. What I know though is that I was about to fall asleep when I played it, and within a few minutes, I started feeling the need to stay awake and see it through. How many movies could have done that? Not many. So cheers to Brian Wilson for his unbelievable music, and thanks to Bill Pohlad for making us discover what was behind the man who sent 'Good vibrations' to the whole world.",9,2,4,6 September 2015
Don't Breathe," Quite entertaining.
","Three teenagers go around houses stealing valuables to resell them and make a profit. Although of a very young age, their dexterity when committing a robbery is quite remarkable. One day, they decide to go for a bigger pay day and enter the house of an old man who supposedly keeps $300000 in his house. What the three burglars don't know is that this blinded old man used to be a marine and he moves around the house like a cat at night. What should have been a straight forward robbery becomes an run for your life situation, where the marine will hunt them down one by one. The mechanics of the movie do not feel like anything new, and although you can guess a few of the things that will happen throughout, there's enough suspense to keep you entertained till the end. I would have preferred a different ending, but I keep that for myself. All in all, a decent enough movie. I have discussed it with a few friends and they all agreed that it is quite watchable. So there you go.",6,0,4,10 December 2016
Hoosiers," Unconvincing
","Hoosiers is your typical movie about sports where a team that is pretty much full of useless players suffers a great change under the supervision of a new coach. The story however does not start easy for the new boss as the locals put unusual amounts of pressure on him to perform and take the team to an honorable position. Fighting against everyone to defend is unique style of teaching basketball, he slowly starts seeing the results of his efforts and get people on his side. While Hoosiers is fun, I can think of many other sports movies that are way more entertaining and inspirational. Here are a few: Moneyball, Invincible, and Rudy.",5,1,8,17 May 2016
"McFarland, USA"," Don't run away from this movie.
","The thought of a movie about running can be off putting, but personally I feel that you should give this movie a chance. You won't be surprised that much by what happens as the structure of it is similar to hundreds of other flicks: the typical success story of a bunch of kids you would not bet $5 on. In this case, they have the gift of running, and their trainer (Kevin Costner) is the man to lead them. By the way, after so many years, I still don't know what to think about Kevin Costner. Is he a good actor? or is he just lucky to still get some roles? I haven't got a clue, but either way, his acting will not spoil the movie. Since it's based on real events, you'll probably watch it out curiosity and forgive any lack of cinematographic quality. You should find it up-lifting and a good enough watch.",6,10,14,16 August 2015
Jersey Boys," The Musical turned into a movie.
","I have to stay I love the music by the four seasons. In fact, I love all the things from the sixties. On top of that, I appreciate Clint Eastwood and I think he's a great director. I also saw the musical in London twice and I thought it was spectacular. So how could I write a review when it's obvious that my expectations were sky high? Unfortunately, as it happens in these cases, I must admit that I was expecting a better movie. Clint Eastwood should have directed this without sticking to the musical so much. What works for a stage act doesn't have to work for a movie and vice versa. One thing I disliked for instance is having the actors directly look at the camera between or during scenes to comment on what was happening. That looked really weird to me. I want the story telling to do that, not a guy giving a speech!On a positive note, I think the actors were very well casted. The guy who interprets Frankie Valli has a wonderful voice (if that voice is his), Christopher Walken is just as good as usual, and makes every scene feel that little bit better. The rest of the crew was spot on as well. But who cares about all this anyway? This movie is all about music. And it is so enjoyable! So, if you can't make it to the theater for the musical, then at least go to the cinema just to appreciate some of the best sounds from the sixties!",6,0,0,20 December 2014
Steve Jobs," Glad to know more about him. But that's it.
","First off, Fassbender is awesome once again. The guy is on his way to becoming a truly amazing actor if he continues pulling performances like this. As for the movie I am glad they showed you the man behind the brand without holding off too much on the real him. Was Steve Jobs a genius? Maybe. Was he a great guy? Based on the movie, you could argue that 99% of people who ever came in contact with him actually disliked the guy. Is this a great movie? No. it is not, but it does not really matter since the point for most of us was to discover who Steve Jobs really was. At least, that's the reason I watched it and I got what I wanted. No more no less. So would I recommend it? For its cinematographic quality i wouldn't, but as a substitute to a book about the life of Steve Jobs it probably does the trick.",6,0,0,14 February 2016
Whiplash," The most inspiring movie I have seen this year!
","I watched the trailer for this movie prior to seeing Interstellar. While I enjoyed Interstellar, when the movie finished, all I could think of was how much I wanted to see Whiplash. Finally, I just did, and I can happily say it was well worth the wait. What an unbelievable feeling when the movie finished!It started a little slow however, and I was also a little confused with what the characters would bring to the table. I couldn't figure out whether the movie was about the love of Jazz music, a man that takes you beyond your limits or about the obsessiveness you need to develop in order to be truly remarkable at what you do. But I guess you have to wait for the ending to be really sure. And when you do, it will lift you off your chair. While I now want to listen to Jazz music more than ever before, and to learn all I can about the likes of Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong and the rest, I also want to go to the fist library and grab any book by Napoleon Hill, and Earl Nightingale to dig deeper into the subject of life goals and personal-success. This is how hard this movie has hit me!Inspiring!",9,0,1,17 January 2015
The Blind Side," For once, I have liked cheese.
","Blind side is not your typical sports movie. It is not focused solely on a guy that comes out of nowhere and makes a losing team become the greatest thing in history. Blind side is about giving without expecting anything in return. There were many things that could have made me dislike this film. Things such as my dislike for Sandra Bullock as an actress, I am also a bit fed up with sport movies, I did not understand certain technicalities of the ball game, etcBut I guarantee you that within the first 30 minutes, I felt like I didn't want the movie to end. What's the matter with me I thought? This movie is rather cheesy and nothing like the ones I normally enjoy. But hell, I even considered re-watching it again! I guess that being based on real events, I accepted its cheesy side of it as nothing more but the typical Hollywoodesque addition to turn a story into entertainment. In any case, it is a movie that should be liked by most audiences. I thoroughly enjoyed it against all odds. In fact, I liked it so much that I am now also a Sandra Bullock fan! That's what I call the power of cinema!",8,0,1,9 June 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," The IMDb rating is well deserved.
","There's always a risk when you watch a movie without knowing anything about it. It's a bit like going to the Opera or the Theatre. You may be mind blown or you may end up really disappointed. At least, at the cinema, the financial risk is a lot lower. In any case, I have to say, I have really liked Birdman and I can clearly see why not only it is nominated to the Oscars but also it is some people's favorite to lift the trophy. And while I mention the Oscars, I should add that Michael Keaton''s performance is absolutely stunning and probably deserves a statue too. No disrespect to the other actors, but if there's any justice, I think it should go to him due to the complexity of the character's personality. However, Hollywood has been known for liking actors whose characters are crippled, ill, and that have lost 20 kilos for the roleso we'll seein any case, back to the movie! Even though, It has a weirdish thing about it, probably a product of the bizarre nature of most characters, and it unfolds entirely within a theatre, it was really entertaining and I found myself laughing several times with some of the dialogues. So not only will I recommend it, but I'll be rooting for it to get a metal at the Oscars. If not, hopefully Whiplash!",8,3,10,22 February 2015
The Big Short," What the hell is Wall Street about?
","Honestly, it' s the one question that popped into my head throughout the movie. I think i have already giving you the clue as to why it is not worth running to the cinema to watch: simply, it is too complicated. So complicated in fact, that during the movie, the director stops the telling of events to teach you the things you must know in order to be able to understand what the movie is about. The feeding of economist info is just too much and you quickly find yourself looking at your hoping for a quick end. This movie will not watch the Oscar! trust me on that! It's nomination only indicates that the this year cinema's quality has taken a knock.",6,1,1,14 February 2016
Blow," Blew me.
","I am ashamed to say that I had not watched this movie before, as from the poster, I thought 'Blow' was some sort of boring love movie involving Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp. If only I had known! In any case, better late than never right? I mean, the movie is great. Depp plays this character that has a normal upbringing. He is raised by a caring father and a neurotic mother. Unfortunately, as an adult he gets involved in the drug business and he seems to be extremely good at it. While he obviously has some great years, leaving a lavish lifestyle, as it often happens, everything spirals down or him all of a sudden. Though, you cannot count blow as an amazingly unique movie (after all, there are many mafia/drug movies out there), I found it quite entertaining. In fact, it makes me want to see the latest Johny Depp flick (Black Mass) see if it just as good.",7,1,1,23 October 2015
Straight Outta Compton," Powerful
","I grew up between Spain and Paris, but NWA was too hard to ignore even in a country where we did not fully understand the lyrics of their songs. We used to listen to their music with tapes and copy their dressing style, but with very little taste. As I look back now, I don't think we could have been tackier if we had tried. About the movieÂ… It's hard to tell how much the director stuck to the real story of what went down in Compton in those years, but either way, I choose to believe it was like we see in the movie. The powerful force of rap music carving a hole into the roots of society at a time when police brutality was questioned more than ever. A group of guys who grew up with nothing and ended up being listened by millions. You can feel the power of their music, their passion and their message. All made for a great movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. The story is still on going for some of them. Dr Dre is the one who succeeded the most, no wonder he gets to be the one that gets the last scene. Watch it! You won't be disappointed.",8,4,30,1 November 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," What was the movie about?
","I had no idea what all this 50 shades of Grey phenomenon was about before watching the movie. Regrettably, after watching it, I still have no clue what it is about. From what I understand, the book has proved a hit within a majority of woman who are generally speaking not really into literature. The type of women who normally devour hello magazine, and felt a need to upgrade to fifty shades of Grey to fantasize about a similar experience with a billionaire. But in the movie, there's no room for fantasy as you are shown images and you have to go with the acting. Your mind doesn't take you further than the screen. So if you stick to it, what is left is very very little. While the girl (Anastasia) shows some decent acting skills and she might need another movie to prove her worth, the guy (Christian Grey) was mediocre at best. He doesn't make you believe about the character for a second. I doubt he'll have a successful career if he is not saved by his looks. The only thing that could have saved the movie was if they had wished to create some suspense around the character and the origins of his mentally disturbed personality. Sadly, the person who adapted the script thought this was an unimportant piece of information for the viewer, so when the girl asks to know more about Christian Grey's past, what you get is a simple: 'I can't tell you or you would hate me'. Wow!! A truly unforgettable line! Honestly, I have real doubts that culturally-aware people will have any interest in the book, and surely not one person will find this flick anymore interesting, unless they are the type to like Jersey Shore or some other rubbish Reality TV show.",2,2,4,19 July 2015
Win Win," Win Win and zzzz
","OK, so you may not fall asleep with this movie, but let me tell you, you won't be jumping around either. What exactly is the story about? A kid who's mother is absent and seems to be a wrestling phenomenon. A granddad who leaves in a retirement home and a few conflicts of interests between adults that seem to all be connected with this lost teenager. So what? honestly, I think a movie should present a problem in the first few minutes, and you should spend the rest of the movie thinking what the outcome will be. But, in this case, it's kind of unclear. OK, it gets easier as the movie progresses with the introduction of the mother figure, but she comes so late in the movie, that it does not feel like she is the reason why of this movie. Unsurprisingly for me, this movie did not do too well... and will quickly be forgotten. Next.",5,0,0,15 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I am no longer a child.
","That is the conclusion I came up with by the end of this new Star Wars. Long gone are the years, when as a kid, I went with my Mum and my sister to watch the Return of the Jedi. I was at the time intrigued by the Force, the Millennium falcon, Han Solo, and of course Darth Vader. But of all this, very little remains. Darth Vader well and truly gone, Han Solo is too old, the force has become weak and the Millennium Falcon is more than ever a piece of junk. This movie is obviously for Star Wars lovers. I always thought I was one, and maybe I am not. I have watched all of them from episode 1 to 7, and will continue to do so for how long as a new one is released, but unless I start watching them again with the eyes of a child, I doubt I will enjoy them the way I would like.",6,8,19,14 February 2016
Spectre," RIP Bond.
","I tell you what, I went to the cinema right after reading a review on the news that claimed this movie was the most boring Bond movie of the last 30 years. I am sorry to disagree. It's the most boring movie of all time. Seriously, this Bond series have got to stop. The character has been squeezed too much and there's no juice left. Everything feels a constant repetition. You can guess the outcome of every scene so easily. If there's a tough guy, he kills him. If there's a hot girl, he has sex with her. If there's any transport around, he will make the craziest stunts with it, while finding the time to kill 10 guys on the way and enjoy some fresh air in the end as if he just had had lunch with his mother. Seriously, I won't bother with this joke agent again. Bond may never die, but he's now dead and buried to me. RIP.",2,6,15,19 November 2015
The Nice Guys," Kind of nice.
","The movie is one of those weirdest but fun but weird to watch movies. The one thing that I feel is to be noted is the incredible connection you feel between the actors. Although, I would not have bet on them being a good duo, they actually deliver really well. The whole story, full of weirdness evolves around the supposed killing of a porn actress that a young kid witnesses from the commodity of his own home. The two protagonists go from being enemies to having to help each other to solve this weirdest criminal story. Serious, often humorous, 'The Nice Guys' make up for a good watch but might not be everyone's favorite. I don't consider this to be a movie for every palate. It's more of a you either love it or hate it kind of movie.",6,4,8,24 November 2016
Me Before You," Alright! you can watch it!
","It's sappy, and forgettable. So much so, that I watched this movie about 10 days ago, and I am having a really really really hard time figuring out what the movie was about. That tells you how memorable it is (not). Me Before you is the story of a girl in a small town that forms an unlikely bond with a recently-paralyzed man she's taking care of. He is dreadful to deal with in the beginning, but the girl needs a salary and the guy is really well off. So she sticks it out, and surprisingly enough, the man opens up little by little to her. Soon they find themselves behaving as if they were inseparable. I again have to admit, I remember little more about it, so I give it a 5 due to indecisiveness.",5,1,4,6 August 2016
The Proposal," Perfect for a bus trip
","The only reason I would consider watching a movie like this is when I am bored or I am traveling from city to city. Having to travel by bus from Zaragoza to Madrid every week, I had gone through most of the movie on offer on the bus. The proposal seemed the least bad choice. The movie is a comedy, and is full of surreal and nonsensical situations. I am not sure they really make your laugh but they keep you awake. The movie is all about seeing the actors in action. If you like Reynolds and Bullock, you will tolerate this movie. If you don't, it may feel like a very long movie. There's plenty of movies similar around. This one is nothing special. Romantic comedy, with its twists and turns and very little unpredictable moments.",5,0,0,6 August 2016
Draft Day," A movie only enjoyed by die hard NFL fans.
","Even for a Sunday evening, you still have to do your homework before choosing a movie to watch, and I didn't. My bad! Draft Day may be interesting for die hard NFL fans, but for a European boy like me, it felt like a bit of a torture. I kept asking myself 'why am I watching this movie?' approximately every 5 minutes. But once I start a movie, I stick to it.However, and beyond the fact that I don't know much about the NFL, I really felt that the movie had zero tension, no matter how much they were trying to create it with constant back and forth phone calls between protagonists. Furthermore, even though it's his most important day of the year, Kevin Costner has to deal with his pregnant girlfriend and an annoying mother who thinks that Draft day is the best moment to solve family issues. On the positive side, the last 10 minutes lift up the movie a little. Still not enough for me to consider this memorable by any means. So once again, if you're an NFL fan you could potentially find some interest for this movie, but if that's not the case, go for something else.",4,0,0,1 March 2015
The Martian," What is a long movie or it felt really long?
","Better read the synopsis before watching The Martian. I did not. That's why I thought it would be some fun sci-fi movie about astronauts landing in Mars and having to defend themselves from the attack of creatures from another planet. Well, that wasn't what the movie was, and I wish it would be. The first hour of the Martian felt long, dragging and utterly boring. Matt Damon, left alone by himself in Mars spends the first half of the movie regurgitating technicalities to a camera where he records himself while explaining what he has to do to survive alone in this new 'home'. If he didn't it would be just impossible for people to understand all the things he is doing. In the second half the movie, a rescue mission gets ready to pick him up, so they talk an talk and talk again in endless meetings about what needs to be done to save their man while the world is watching. Although this second part is slightly more entertaining than the first one, I really could not wait for the movie to finish. Boring! It's all i can say.",5,0,1,10 December 2016
Up in the Air," Not sure what I just watched.
","This might be one of the most difficult reviews I ever make, cause the truth is, I have no idea what the purpose of this movie was. What exactly was it about? A loner who flies around the world sacking people for a living and ends up pretty much the same at the end, and in between. You get a sense that he might change his ways half way through the movie as he meets a woman who seems to be his perfect match, his female version. But you are wrong! It's only a mirage, and the man gets back to his old ways in a split second. Now with a sad look on his face though. So without the passion that characterized the first few minutes, he continues traveling and he travels, and travelsOn the flip side, you get to see many aerial views of USA cities. If you are interested in that, you may have found a reason to watch this movie.",5,1,1,3 August 2015
