The Rock," Best performance from Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery ever of their best action film of 1996 hit!
","The Rock (1996) is a classic action film from Michael Bay and one of the best Nicholas Cage films ever! Con Air is his first favorite film of mine The Rock is his second favorite film of mine. I love this film to death and I can watch it over and over again! This is Nicholas Cage's best performance ever, I love his character FBI Special Agent Dr. Stanley Goodspeed who did saved over 1000 human lives in San Francisco while he raced against time to disarm the bombs! Seriously it is one of my favorite action films and Nicolas Cage's favorite film. This film has everything, it has solid cast, entertaining thrill, Die Hard in a prison a lot of action and it is not boring. The practical effects of the film are well done and are realistic, it has a lot of explosions, car chases and so on. There are no CGI in this film, mostly Nicholas Cage is more interesting in here than Sean Connery is.'Welcome to the Rock.' Plot: Nicolas Cage is Stanley Goodspeed, an FBI chemical weapons specialist who is brought into a hostage situation involving a crew of former US Marines, led by a rogue US Marine general (Ed Harris), who have taken over the former prison on Alcatraz Island and are threatening the city of San Francisco with a launch of missiles filled with deadly VX poison gas. Goodspeed finds himself going along on the mission to retake the prison with a squad of US Navy SEALS and John Mason (Sean Connery), a former SAS operative who has been imprisoned illegally for the past two decades, and the only man to have escaped the prison and can use his knowledge infiltrate 'The Rock'.So that is basically the plot of the film. Stanley Goodspeed, an FBI chemical weapons specialist has to take on a group of Former US Marines who took over the prison Alcatraz with 80 tourists who took them as hostages and they are extortion their government for $100 million or they will launch the rockets on San Francisco. Everyone in this film does a great job. Sean Connery former James Bond, Indy's father from Indiana Jones and the last Crusade (1989) is brilliant in his performance as Captain John Patrick Mason, Special Air Service and Ed Harris as Brigadier General Francis X. 'Frank' Hummel, USMC Force Recon is brilliant and great villain.The script was great and the screen writers did a solid job and Michael Bay beside Bad Boys I and II did a really good solid job ever directing it! Con Air was the action film that really introduced me in to Nicolas Cage films so my beautiful mom bought me on my request Con Air, Face/Off and The Rock (1996) on VHS, which I still have all those films on tapes and I own them on Blu-ray and I still keep the old VHS tapes of those films. I love Con Air and The Rock but I hate Face/off which I think it is one of the worst boring lame action films from John Woo and Nicolas Cage ever! But Con Air and The Rock kicks ass I love these two films I love watching them. It is been 20 years anniversary since The Rock 1996 come out, it is my childhood film and I always cherish my childhood movies to death! Things: I love about this film: Nicolas Cage's character was so caring and awesome, when on the island in prison General Francis X. Hummel's men kill all NAVY Seals team except John Patrick Mason and Stanley Goodspeed, Cage want's to disarme the bombs while Connery want's to get off the island, Cage want's to convince Connery to helps him, which he does on the end. The two fight each other against a team rogue former US Marines to stop them, by killing innocent people. General Francis X. Hummel is not a monster like he was showing in the beginning of the film, he only wanted that government pays the money to the family's for loosing their sons and fathers. I also love the scene in which Sean Connery throws a knife in to one of the marines guarding the rocket, and killing the other marine while firing a machine gun on him awesome! Overall: I love this flick to death I am giving 10 out of 10 for one of my favorite Nicolas Cage action films.The Rock is a 1996 American action thriller film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, written by David Weisberg and Douglas S.

The Avengers," Bad-ass descent-amazing superhero MCU action flick defenders of the earth my favorite
","Marvel's The Avengers (2012) is an awesome descent MCU superhero action flick that is spectacular and a real good one. The first time I watched it on my computer I loved it. I have seen this movie many times in the row I have this film on DVD and Blu-ray. The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. Joss Whedon did a fine job directing the film and I loved it is definitely in my top 10 favorite MCU superhero films. In the finale battle in New York the moment right there.. WILL NEVER... EVER.. BE AS COOL.. LIKE THIS WAS A COMIC MASTERPIECE.. I don't even read comics, but I did superheroes when I was younger.. I have a feeling justice league will never have this cohesion... this team work.. and will never be able to recreate this feeling.Robert Downey Jr. does a good job as a Iron Man he has a lot of good moments when he talks with Loki. In the third act he has to fight Thor that was cool then in the third act he had to do a lot of stuff, did the final stuff to safe the world. He is very much star of the film, that is why he number 1 star of the film he was payed a lot of more money then the other actors did ,but he deserved it he did a good job. Chris Evans as Captain America was spectacular I love his character I love how he defended and safe those people in the restaurant against Loki's army I thought that was descent. He does kick some ass when Thor hits him he uses his shield when SHIELD's ship was attacked he and Iron Man were trying to fix the ship I loved that. Mark Ruffalo was okay as The Hulk I thought he was better than Edward Norton's Hulk at least that is my opinion. Chris Hemsworth I liked him as Thor he was great. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was fantastic what does she do? She deals with the Hulk and Hawkeye the evil Hawkeye which I think is great. Jeremy Renner I like him a as an actor he is cool, he is mostly the bad guy in the film till the third act. In the third act he did a lot of cool stuff, he is cool with arrows. Loki he did fine the actor did fine as the villain I like him and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury did fine. In the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.The pacing to me I thought it was little boring and it was too long but the third act was really was fast paced and the movie interested how 6 superheroes become a team who turn in to Avengers I think there was a lot of action scenes in the film that were really well done. I like special effect, I had a lot of fun scenes Hulk punching Thor or punching Loki when he said is emperor. That was fun, the film it self had a lot of action it self's. It was entertaining, the CGI was really good, Robert Downey Jr. had a lot funny moments and hilarious dialogues. I have more enjoyed Captain America because he cared more about people and of course Iron Man he saved the world from Loki's invaders. I thought it was an alright and I love it. It is definitely my favorite MARVEL superhero movie.Admittedly the first half or so isn't nearly as epic as the final 30 minutes. And the plot isn't that original. But I got what I paid for with this flick, Awesome action with Earth's Mightiest Heroes kicking alien ass.The Avengers in my honest opinion was better than Man of Steel because right next year DC superman movie come out that I have hated it and I wish I could have get the money back. I am going to try and sell the movie out. Marvel's The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon. I have reviewed 2 years the second movie twice and as a MARVEL fan I can say I have enjoyed this movie much more than Avengers: Age of Ultron. I am waiting now on Avengers: Infinity War and of course Spider-Man: Homecoming which is a spin off Captain America: Civil War like I said I have enjoy all three Captain America Films and I enjoy both Avenger films and I love Iron Man and Iron Man Three I am one of the fans that I liked that films. The rating I give is 10/10",10,140,207,2 July 2017
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Underrated gem solid, unfair criticized, a decent well made the last good Nicolas Cage movie sequel!
","National Treasure: Book of Secrets (2007) it is unfairly criticized and trashed by critics and fans of the first film. My honest opinion is: this is the last good Nicolas Cage movie he has done, before he start making direct to video trash movies. Nicolas Cage returns with his famous character Ben Franklin Gates. I forgot to mentioned in the first film review Nicolas reunited with producer Jerry Bruckheimer for the fifth time in the row producing this film. The first film with Nicolas Cage was The Rock (1996) on which the actor and producer worked together. I disagree with people saying this was unnecessary sequel, it is a good sequel and I love this film, but I don't love it that much as I love the first movie! The first movie is the best one of the two, Nicolas Cage also reunites with Ed Harris from The Rock (1996). Ed Harris plays again another villain and I must say for my honest opinion Ed Harris is way better villain than Sean Bean is in the first film. I was really surprised how much fun I had with this film, you also do have a lot's of action and car chases. We have returning cast from the first movie: Nicolas Cage, Justin Bartha, Diane Kruger, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel and Armando Riesco.Plot: Benjamin Gates must follow a clue left in John Wilkes Booth's diary to prove his ancestor's innocence in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.I don't know what is the problem with this film I think it is a good film and I really like the character development, but still is not better than the first film. The first film is still way better than this one. This film is about clearing Ben Gates ancestor's name and innocence that he wasn't co conspirator in assassination of US president Abraham Lincoln and that he was set up, before he died and was killed. It references on Abraham Lincoln US president that was assassinated and it is again a history film. This film doesn't evolves around museums like was in the first movie but it evolves about a book that leads to a clues.I love National Treasure 2. It's funny, gripping and informative. This film is the American history in the plot story, which is surprisingly accurate. Its nice to see a film that shows respect to it's story and doesn't reinvent it and destroy it completely. Its also nice to see a sequel that hasn't been rushed. I absolutely enjoyed this film on Blu-ray. I bought this film together on Blu-ray with the first film and I have absolutely enjoy it and I had fun with it. Con Air, The Rock and National Treasure 1 and 2 are my favorite Nicolas Cage movies and are favorite of mine that I can watch them over and over again and they aren't that violent like are Face/Off, Left Behind, Windtalkers films I seriously hate that movies that Nicolas Cage was involved!Things I do like in the film: the end when Ed Harris sacrifice him self to save all the people trapped in a cave. Nicolas Cage clearing his ancestor's name and for the discovery of a secret also gives a credit to Ed Harris. In the caves you have a lot of booby traps. Nicolas Cage and Diane Kruger's character development was excellent specially their fight in the museum. Helen Mirren is also cast as Ben Gates mom a professor on the university that Jon Voight's character don't get along with it, but on the end of the film, they both show their feelings and that they are still in love. Showing our beloved heroes in a caves was fantastic, Ben Gates kidnapping American President in a secret passage so that president tells him the secret clue hiding in library's book was brilliant. This film is brilliant and excellent so I don't get the hate for this film! Helen Mirren as Ben Gates mom was excellent in her role, she also played in Red 1 and 2 and Teaching Mrs. Tingle (1999) I mostly know her from those movies. Everything in this movie is excellent, special effects and mostly the characters are wonderful that I love.The director Jon Turteltaub did an amazing job on this movie! It is just as exciting as the first one, but is a whole new story, and a whole new adventure to go on. Trevor Rabin reprise the score theme from the first movie which is solid.Overall: I love Natural Treasure 2 it is Nicolas Cage last good movie he done and my favorite of the actor, the rating is A+ 9/10 a good sequel but not that great as the first one, but still a fun watchable flick.National Treasure: Book of Secrets (released on home video as National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets) is a 2007 mystery adventure film directed by Jon Turteltaub and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. It is a sequel to the 2004 film National Treasure and is the second part of the National Treasure franchise.9/10 Grade: A+ Studio: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Starring: Nicolas Cage, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, Ed Harris, Diane Kruger, Justin Bartha, Bruce Greenwood, Helen Mirren, Armando Riesco, Alicia Coppola, Albert Hall Director: Jon Turteltaub Producers: Jon Turteltaub, Jerry Bruckheimer Screenplay: Cormac Wibberley, Marianne Wibberleyer Story by Gregory Poirier, Cormac Wibberley, Marianne Wibberley, Terry Rossio, Ted Elliott Rated: PG Running Time: 2 Hr. 04 Mins.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A true disappointment of The Hunger Games franchise and real end of the series
","I am a big fan of the first two movies specially the first one.How can you say: 'since I thought it was way better than the first two'? What is wrong with you? This movie Is long, boring and nothing happened in the last two hours. It is worst than Catching Fire is worst than The Hunger Games and The Worst of the series and all Hunger Games movies. Katniss does not do nothing! All she does is winning and crying about Peeta trough whole god damn movie. Peeta, Peeta, Peata...cry, cry...I lost them both....... cry' In this movie their is not enough Haymitch, President Snow, Effie, Johanna only at the end of the movie and she is bold what happened?, Caesar and Finnick.None of the actors or actress is good enough or did a good job except Jennifer Lawrence. I did not pay to see Katniss being a whinny selfish cry baby trough whole movie.I pay to see a bad-ass and that's what in this movie wasn't and killed the previous movies and the third sequel. All she did was walking and talking and winning about Peeta for 2.hrs. What an embarrassment awful boring disappointment! The Hunger Games (2012) the first movie of the series in my opinion was the best of all the three films ever made from the novels. I thought was pretty damn good awesome start of the series from it's books I love it and it is my favorite. Katniss killed three people in the first movie and she was very gorgeous talented and very intelligent. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) was pretty good damn sequel and that a good one, I love it very much. The first hour was boring, the second hour when they were in arena and it was shown in an IMAX version was really pretty surprisingly, amazingly awesome and so very intense that you could not shut your eyes and not see what will happen next. Katniss killed one person and a few apes that was really pretty awesome for the second Hunger Games movie like was the whole movie Rocky II. IMAX version was at least 49 min shown. Katniss finally showed real feelings for Peeta and not just an act like she did in the first movie and trough whole 2.hrs in the second movie. That's what I thought the movie was so interested, that there was a real romance in it and not just an act. The second movie was pretty damn good but did not beat the first one. The third movie The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 (2014) is the worst one of the three and awful terrible sequel of the first two movies and it is a sad true disappointment. I hope part 2 redeems it self and get's better than this movie is. I also own both the previous movies of on Blu-ray discs and this movie will not come near my Blu-ray collection! I wanted to see Katniss rescuing Peeta shooting with the bow and arrow,kill at least a few enemies that deserve it , getting closer to President Snow and Capital. Katniss been a bad-ass and tough, trough whole movie but sadly she was not. She was a cry baby and she did do anything except winning.I excepted so much more from Katniss than just this: more intense what will happened in the next scene but there was absolutely nothing. Nothing! It took a real bad turn. Katniss been hot and interesting but instead she was gross. Effie and Johanna gorgeous but no sadly they weren't. My final question for the people who like this movie is : Why do you like this movie so much? When is not what it is supposed to be for us true fans and what we expected and wanted to be. A true disappointment!",1,12,16,3 March 2015
The Incredible Hulk," An Incredible reboot overall improvement over the original!
","The Incredible Hulk (2008) is A Marvel pure, fun, popcorn, Action superhero Film! This film is miles way better than The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron and 2003 film Hulk! I take this movie over both Avengers films and 2003 Hulk! This movie right now is still to this day, the most underrated Marvel movie of all-time. The majority of people disliking this movie and loves Mark Ruffalo's Avengers Hulk. In my opinion Edward Norton's Hulk/Bruce Banner is still to this day the best (not saying that Mark Ruffalo was bad because by all means he wasn't). This movie has class effects and it just as good as Iron Man. After watching Hulk (2003) I was really, really disappointed over that lame over long, boring to death super wannabe comic book film. Watching this, I was highly enjoyed, the movie was entertained, not bad at all, it was pretty good. Not boring, not to over long, I have enjoyed the hell out of this movie. It is awesome Action superhero comic book flick that does the job right! I am not a big comic book reader fan, I have not read Hulk comic books, but I did have watch the original TV show The Incredible Hulk (1977 - 1982) as a child. Been the biggest fan of that show, I know that in the TV show that, there was a reporter Jack McGee who was chasing Hulk trough the state, in this film Jack McGee is mentioned but as a journalist reporter student. Edward Norton did a solid job as Bruce Banner, he was even more convincing than Eric Bana. A massive improvement from the last movie. Edward Norton gets the character right all the way through. Eric Bana was the worst choice for playing the most iconic character Bruce Banner. The original bored me to hell, I will never watch it again. But this one I will it is my favorite flick alongside Iron Man 1 & 3, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor: The Dark World and Thor. Liv Tyler did amazing job as Betty Ross, but I still love Jennifer Connelly to death, I have enjoyed watching her in the Original flick Hulk. Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky/Abomination is great and fantastic in this flick, he was the most awesome villain in this film, unlike original who had none villain in the movie except David Banner (Nick Nolte). This movie has a heart and Edward Norton is the best, but Billy Bixby will be the only David Banner around here not Nick Nolte or Paul Kersey!:P. Lou Ferrigno was respectfully in this movie who has play the 'Hulk' in the 70's TV Show, I have mentioned before he was also in Hulk (2003) original he played the same Security Guard that he have played here. I remember the scene where Bruce comes dressed as a pizza deliver boy on the campus and brings security guard a pizza, that security guard on university campus is Lou Ferrigno! I have recognized him immediately. Lou Ferrigno even voices Hulk, his first words where after the original film 'Betty' where changed too: 'leave me alone' and 'Hulk smash!' really great lines. Right after Iron Man (2008) was finished and released out, Tony Stark (the always wonderfully charismatic Robert Downey Jr.) made a cameo scene on the end of credits towards Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross: (William Hurt). Director Louis Leterrier did a great solid job directing this fast paced action flick. He expressed interest in directing Iron Man but he couldn't because Jon Favreau was already MARVEL's first choice to direct the flick, but instead he was brought on board with writer Zak Penn who started to work on a loose sequel that would be much closer to the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name. And they both proved and did made a great solid job working together. Things I love about this film that work so great: The chemistry between Bruce (Edward Norton) and Betty (Liv Tylor) were great and amazing. The suspense, a c t i o n, drama, romance, comedy, special effects all perfectly blended to create this spectacular superhero flick. The hulk himself is portrayed as he should be. A rampaging monster with heart and a creature who is misunderstood. The fight scenes between Hulk and Abomination where really great, just like was in Iron Man movie, Hulk defeated Abomination but did not killed him, when Betty told him not too and she stopped him. The Incredible Hulk is the second feature film adaptation of the Marvel comic book series (the first being 2003's Hulk). Edward Norton stars as Bruce Banner, who goes into hiding as he tries to find a way to reverse the mutation that causes him to become the green beast. This film was directed by Louis Leterrier and is part of 'Phase One' of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that includes Iron Man, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger and culminated in 2012's The Avengers. The rating I am giving to this movie is 9, it is great superhero flick! I rather watch this than MARVEL Avengers, I will never watch them again! 9/10 Score: A Studio: Marvel Studios, Universal Pictures Starring: Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson, Ty Burrell Director: Louis Letterrier Producers: Avi Arad, Gale Anne Hurd, Kevin Feige Screenplay by Zak Penn Based on Hulk by Stan Lee Jack Kirby Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 1 Hr. 52 Mins.

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Underrated solid pure fun action prequel in the trilogy!
","Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) is very underrated pure fun action prequel to the prequel Star Wars trilogy. I think this movie is very hated and very bashed from critics and fans. In my opinion I love it, I think it is miles way better flick than The Force Awakens! The Phantom Menace didn't kill Han Solo (in such a awful way) or rip off A New Hope beat. The Phantom Menace has a cooler villain in Darth Maul (and a cooler weapon. And at LEAST Phantom Menace has some new music that was worth Duel of the Fates. Like I said I love Liam Neeson as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Ewan McGregor as his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi in this flick. I think the actors did a wonderful job, the way George Lucas imagine to do it. I love Queen Amidala/Padmé with all that make up and the costume that was created for her. Natalie Portman did an excellent job portraying her character, she is very sexy talented and extremely gorgeous in here. I remember in 1999 when they were talking about filming this film, I still have news papers clips saved in my drawer when they where filming this film. Honestly I love The Phantom Menace more than Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. Plot: Two Jedi Knights escape a hostile blockade to find allies and come across a young boy who may bring balance to the Force, but the long dormant Sith resurface to reclaim their old glory. This film has two cool villains: Darth Maul and Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord. This film has a incredible race when we meet Anakin Skywalker as a child, before he become Vader. I have enjoyed watching the race when Anakin was racing against several obstacles including rival racer Sebulba to win the race. Personally I think Jake Lloyd did a perfect job playing Anakin Skywalker. We even have Samuel L. Jackson in this film before he was Nick Fury in MARVEK's Avengers. The flashy special effects and the climactic lightsaber fight at the end Darth Maul with cool long saber was awesome villain and his red double-bladed lightsaber was fantastic created. The final epic fight when Qui-Gon and Obi Wan engage Darth Maul on Naboo was a climatic fight that I loved it, Qui-Gon was injured from Darth Maul, but Obi Wan cut him in a half and defeat him on the end, I like that. I didn't see anything bad about that. Ewan McGregor as young apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi did an outstanding job and had fun portraying his character, I found him very amazing without a beard and been a good apprentice to his Jedi master Qui-Gon. Liam Neeson as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn did a wonderful job portraying the character I am a fan of Liam Neeson, he even had a small role in Batman Begins and you know the man can act. Personally I more cared about Liam Neeson's character Qui-Gon Jinn and the first climactic lightsaber fight with Darth Maul who later we found out, that he know the Jedi skills. John Williams was to be one person putting honest effort into the prequels, it was definitely him and his music. The soundtrack to this movie is my favorite of all of the series.There are a few problems that film suffers:The problem with Episode I is that the film sometimes becomes boring. The plot starts off with a tax dispute. I found that very unlike the nature of Star Wars, but I am still willing to give it a chance. For a while, things were kinda looking up. But once the characters land on Tatooine, I lose all interest. The podracing scene goes on for way too long. I found all the characters to be dull and monotonous. The subplot where Anakin also being the creator of C-3P0 adds absolutely nothing to the story whatsoever, other than making it more contrived and confusing. Jar Jar Binks honestly was pretty dull stupid character, he annoyed me trough the half of the film, with his silliness and his annoying tongue, I really had that problem with the character watching him on screen. The only thing I liked about him was the end when he lead the battle against the army of droids.The army of droids were annoying with lines: 'roger, roger' I hated that so much and I hated them.I hated the Gungan resistance I hated them the same as I did Jar Jar Binks, I hate the characters. The film is too over long at 2 hrs and 16 Mins. is too over long for me, not even the Original Star Wars film wasn't that long. I am giving an 8 out of 10 mainly for been so bashed and been hated. Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace is a 1999 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is the first installment in the Star Wars prequel trilogy and stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Pernilla August and Frank Oz.8/10 Grade: A- Studio: 20th Century Fox, Lucasfilm Ltd.

3:10 to Yuma," Russell Crowe's fine western flick that i was blown away
","3:10 to Yuma (2007) it is a fine western film from Russell Crowe and Christian Bale directed by James Mangold. It is a remake of the 1957 film of the same name, making it the second adaptation of Elmore Leonard's short story 'Three-Ten to Yuma'. Filming took place in various locations in New Mexico. 3:10 to Yuma opened September 7, 2007, in the United States and received positive reviews from critics.I am big fan of Russell Crowe and I love his movies and this was his second western film he did. The first one was in 1995 The Quick and the Dead with Sharon Stone which is definitely one of my favorite western films. I love Clint Eastwood western films such a: A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Pale Rider, High Plains Drifter, The Outlaw Josey Wales. I love Young Guns, Tombstone, I already mentioned The Quick and the Dead, 3:10 to Yuma is also one of my favorite western films today. This movie is about so many things. Good and Evil (or right and wrong) and the blurry line that sometimes separates them, what drives a man toward one or the other. It's about desperation and self-preservation. Ben Wade is a criminal who from the first moment in the story we see has redeeming qualities, and as many criminals, he is also charming. Dan Evans is a good man, who comes close more than once to crossing that blurry line, out of desperation. There is Evan's boy, who is in a position to choose a hero (there are no heroes in this film). There is a lot at stake for both 'sides' in this movie. While there are some negative opinions about the ending, I don't think it would have been satisfactory any other way.The pacing is good, the movie goes fast around it is not boring or overlong, the acting from everyone is solid, the action is good. I like the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. I must say Russell Crow is a talented actor and his movies are really good of course he is not great like is Keanu Reeves but he is way better than fat pig Arnold today. I love the characters in this movie and the chemistry between two leads (Crowe and Bale).3:10 to Yuma is a good western movie some say it is a classic I don't think it is, but it is close to a classic. We have a lots of shootouts and of course a real explosions. Ben Wade and Dan Evens are fine characters to watch, we have Peter Fonda as a bounty hunter Byron McElroy. This was a damn good western movie and I wish they would make more movies like are this one today. I hated Django Unchained to death I thought that movie sucked a hairy dick but this movie was a fine western that I was blown away. I had no clue this was even up for Oscar nominations. But, I can certainly see why with such a competent script, great storytelling, and even greater characters played impeccably by Bale and Crowe. I particularly enjoyed watching the chemistry that grew between them as the film progressed, which was elaborated upon even better due to their opposing personalities (Evans being the giver, and Wade being the taker). In fact, there were many a scene that I'd like to say I found thoroughly heroic and almost inspiring, in a sort of bittersweet retrospect, but at the expense of not ruining some of the more dramatic plot twists, I'll leave the viewing to you, the audience. The film presents a terrific balance of action, drama, and character development, all while being very realistic to the old west in terms of design and production. Aesthetically speaking, I'd probably go so far as to call it the best looking Western to date. Critically, I'd almost put it as one of my all-time favorite films, but I thought the overall length was just a tad too short for all the material to really stick with me by film's end. The rating I give to this film is 8/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD western film (it is sure as hell better than all the remakes like Django Unchained that get high scores) needs their head examined. I give it another point because what it does attempt to do it accomplishes so easily and perfectly. (For reference, I gave Eastwood movies a ten.) Any true weakness it has is simply that it's just an western movie, and that's it. It's hard to say anything bad (other than nitpicks) about the film itself.3:10 to Yuma is a 2007 American Western film directed by James Mangold and produced by Cathy Konrad, and starring Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in the lead roles, with supporting performances by Peter Fonda, Gretchen Mol, Ben Foster, Dallas Roberts, Alan Tudyk, Vinessa Shaw, and Logan Lerman. It is about a drought-impoverished rancher (Bale) who takes on the dangerous job of taking a notorious outlaw (Crowe) to justice. 8/10 Grade: B+ Studio: Lionsgate Starring: Russell Crowe, Christian Bale, Peter Fonda, Gretchen Mol, Ben Foster, Dallas Roberts, Alan Tudyk, Vinessa Shaw, Logan Lerman Director: James Mangold Producer: Cathy Konrad Screenplay: Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt, Derek Haas Based on Three-Ten to Yuma by Elmore Leonard Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hrs. 02 Mins.

The Expendables 2," Better than the first and one of the best movie of the franchise!
","The Expendables 2 (2012) it's really action packed and one of the best movies of the franchise. It is even better than the first one! You're blasted off in the first few minutes leading up to the actual story. Obviously, this is not a film with a great script or impressive acting. However, the story works well for what it's supposed to do! It is greatly entertaining if you are looking for an action packed movie loaded with iconic action stars like Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Willis and Schwarzenegger. Back for War!No time from opening credits, its straight into the action, which is more epic , and is what should have been seen in the first film but maybe due to a low budget we were subjected to a lesser affair The team work well, all of them and Hemsworth does really well as the new boy on the block and second time round and you kind of know these guys. Arnie, Bruce are seen more but are not seen as much as the usual gang, and Li is seen the least. Norris is great, seen here and there, great entrance and more of a cameo, and Van Damme makes good his role as the villain. Different locations than the first movie great performances by Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme with different roles that's what makes this movie the best in the franchise. I do like the First one but if I am ranting the best of the franchise I choose 2 in my opinion the best of the movie franchise I do like a lot the first movie the most that I have remember it was 2. I was pumped. I'll admitted that. Best action movie all year. That's a fact people. The Expendables 2 is also one of my favorite action movies. The first time I saw this movie I loved it much more than the first one I did. This time the story is set in Europe and It Is American movie and I wish Jet Li had more screen time then only like 13 minutes or 15.minutes or how many times he had. Other things I enjoyed more than I did the third one. Like the first movie, I really enjoyed this one too especially getting to see Chuck Norris sharing the screen with Stallone and Schwarzenegger.You pretty much know what you're getting with 'The Expendables 2': a group of past-and-present action stars making wisecracks and blowing stuff up. And much like its predecessor, this film delivers on a truly massive scale. The plot itself is pretty straightforward. Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) has a relatively simple task for the Expendables, whose epic ranks include Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, and, this time out, Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger. But when the plan goes awry, our heroes seek vengeance against the ruthless mercenary Jean Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme). From the rapidly-paced action sequences to the ridiculously over-the-top deaths, this film plays out like a big-budget B movie on steroids.One problem I do have with the film I forgot to mentioned: Why Did Schwarzenegger used his line I'll be back from The Terminator and Willis used his words against him by saying: 'You've been back enough. I'll be back.' Schwarzenegger: 'Yippee-ki-yay.' why were those lines written in the script? Why did those two actors had to make a fool of them self's? With both of their famous roles: Terminator and Die Hard-John McClane ? Why? I am sorry I don't like that those two famous actors make fool of them self's, by spelling wrong their famous lines! Why was no Mickey Rourke in this film? I loved him in the first film, why wasn't he here. Why was Jet Li only 13.mins. in here? Why was this film set in the Europe and not on American Soil? Those are just the main problems I just have with the film, I am sorry, but I am just been honest. The Expendables are back and this time it's personal! When one of their own is viciously killed, Barney (Sylvester Stallone) and his band of mercenaries cut a swath of destruction to avenge their lost teammate and race to stop five tons of weapons-grade plutonium from falling into the wrong hands. This action-packed sequel boasts an all-star cast, including Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. An awesome basic plot of the film! I love this film to death and it is my favorite best film of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Lundgren, Norris and Van Damme. I am giving a 10/10 to this film because it deserves it and I just love it to death! I did enjoy it and it was awesome for me. If you're looking for a great movie like a critic at RT then you're going to be disappointed. Look at the cast and just see it for what it always was intended to be; a classic action movie with classic lines and even awesome action scenes. So that was what I expected and loved itThe Expendables 2 is a 2012 American ensemble action film directed by Simon West, written by Richard Wenk and Sylvester Stallone and based on a story by Ken Kaufman, David Agosto and Wenk. Brian Tyler returned to score the film. 10/10 Score: A+ Studio: Lionsgate Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Terry Crews, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Chuck Norris, Liam Hemsworth, Jean-Claude Van Damme Director: Simon West Producers: Avi Lerner, Danny Lerner, Kevin King Templeton, Les Weldon Screenplay: Sylvester Stallone Story: David Agosto, Ken Kaufman, Richard Wenk Based on Characters: by David Callaham Rated: R Running Time: 1Hr. 43 Mins.

Iron Man 3," A Big improvement over Iron Man 2 : Defending an Underrated Marvel third entry!
","Iron Man 3 (2013) is A Marvel pure, fun, popcorn, Action Film and the third entry of the Iron Man trilogy. It is an awesome superhero Action flick a huge improvement over Iron Man 2 (2010) and million ways better than the new Marvel comic book film Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)!!!!!!!! This film is very criticized and bashed from it is fans. I admit it the first time I watched this film, I hated it, with the Mandarian joke the twist and Guy Pearce been the bad guy and so on. But now after I watch it I was highly impressed and Entertained, this film wasn't boring it had less humor in it and was the most serious with action scenes. Shure there is less Iron Man and more Tony in it, but doesn't ruined my loving for Iron man trilogy! The most what I love of this film is. There wasn't any Avengers in it trough the whole film. Only Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk made a cameo scene on the end of the credits but that was it and it did not bother me or annoyed. The story centers around Tony Stark not Avengers, that is why I just love this movie! Thank god Jon Favreau step down as the Director and Shane Black replaced him! I was surprised by the fact that Disney allowed Shane Black making an Action film flick in Lethal Weapon and Die Hard With a Vengeance style! Yes Action style!I am defending this film against haters. I know a lot of people who will see my review will put it down, just like 30 people put down my review Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)! First off this film isn't Die Hard With A Vengeance or Lethal Weapon film even tough Tony and Rhodes are fighting with guns without their armors. I love the film because it is serious it has Action. Gwyneth Paltrow did a wonderful performance as Pepper un like she did in Iron Man 2. And yes fans I am saying it. She was so damn annoying in Iron Man 2, I disliked watching her in that movie, in this film she is a supporting and caring girlfriend unlike Iron Man 2.I love this film because The film sets place after the events of The Avengers on Christmas Eve!!! Tony Stark (the always wonderfully charismatic Robert Downey Jr.) is falling apart. This is the first time I see Tony Stark and Iron Man in a snow in Christmas, This film reminds me on Batman Returns (1992) Tim Burton's film. It is pretty good. The attack on Tony's house whit helicopters blowing Tony's house to pieces was the first time in the film I ever saw. Gwyneth put Iron Man Armor on in and she saved Maya Hansen that was outstanding. The scene was pure action! There was kid in this film and no he wasn't annoying, he did a good job helping Tony Stark against his post traumatic stress disorder attacks. Not annoying kid and I think he did a good job. Tony Stark was brilliant fixing and building a new armored suits. Iron Man saved 13. passengers from falling off the airplane Air Force One, tough he crashed in the truck, I loved that scene. Aldrich Killian participated in the development of Extremis thereby amassing a group of Extremis-enhanced soldiers under his command. Killian played by an awesome Guy Pierce did a wonderful job portraying a villain to Tony Stark. I really think Guy Pierce just did an amazing job portraying a villain in Iron Man 3 he was some A.I.M. soldier creating a terrorist attacks and he was brilliant to make an alias Mandarin! To mask his illegal activities as terrorist attacks he created the idealized terrorist persona known as the 'Mandarin'! that was brilliant and I love the twist!Tony Stark, is proved in this third and more than likely final chapter in the solo run of Iron Man. Iron Man 3 or Three as it appears in the end credits amps up the action and closes out the trilogy on a high note setting Tony's eventual return in summer 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron. But in his most darkest moments he is challenged by his emotions of what happened to him in New York, while dealing with the biggest threat he has encountered: Mandarin. Without given any plot points away for those who may have not seen this, but Iron Man 3 is well worth the admission and then some. People Iron Man 3 sets up Marvel's Phase 2 of features.This is the best Iron Man movie yet, better than Iron Man 2 and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) Loved the storyline and Tony was a genius and brilliant again as usual. Great special effects. A very busy, action- and humour-packed comic-book flick. Better than Iron Man 2, but not nearly as good as the original. As usual, Ben Kingsley (as Trevor Slattery) rocked, as did even-sexier-when-angry Gwyneth Paltrow. :-D The acting. Robert Downey is as good as ever, Paltrow, Pearce, Cheadle & Co follow not far behind. The best is Ben Kingsley, though, although his character is ... no, I just want to mention the Good here.Iron Man 3 (stylized on screen as Iron Man Three) is a 2013 superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.When Tony Stark's world is torn apart by a formidable terrorist called the Mandarin, he starts an odyssey of rebuilding and retribution.The rating I am giving to this movie is 9/10",9,148,186,22 October 2015
John Wick," The best action revenge film of all time from 2014 so far!
","John Wick (2014) is the best revenge flick from Keanu Reeves of 2014 from The Matrix (1999) to John Wick (2014) another action fast paced, Entertaining slick action packed film, which kind I have never seen before. It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80's sensibility. It's nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!Old school action with no shaky cam. Definitely the best stunt-man-turned-director-debut I've ever seen. The story is set about John Wick (Keanu Reeves) a retired assassin, who gets dragged back into his field when the Russian Mob put a hit out on him, but instead of killing John, they steal his classic Mustang and kill his newly acquired puppy. This sets John out to exact revenge on the whole mob in a no nonsense kind of way...multiple shots to the chest and one to the head for good measure type of justice. I've never seen a film where the gun play is this to the point and precise as this. I don't know what the body count is, but it's gotta be up there...way up there. Oh...and another thing...they actually reload the guns. Don't see that that often in films. It's got an all star cast of cameo/small roll characters, from Ian McShane, William Dafoe, and John Leguizamo, and I swear one of the bad guy henchman is that 'Mayhem' Insurance guy. One of the Best Movie, that Keanu Reeves ever made. From start to finish. Non stop action, all scenes look very realistic. ( The best action movie of the year. ) I Love this movie so much I think the people behind this movie made a great astonish action movie. There are other things in the movie that I love so much. I even think John Wick is so much better than 47 Ronin (2013) that Keanu Reeves made. The most that I love in this movie is Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins I think she did one of the best job portraying and playing the most memorable female assassin I have ever seen. Ms. Perkins made me realized and inspired me that there are a lot of women who choose occupation as a female assassin hired by the mob. There were a lot of female actresses who played an assassin but I have never see any women portrayed like that. Adrianne Palicki is a bad ass! She even played Lady Jaye in the G.I. Joe Team's covert operations a specialist in the movie G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013) one of my favorite movies. The fight sequence between John Wick and Viggo Tarasov is real and very realistic I did not see any CGI in it. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The The stunts are completely insane in scale. There is a lot of gun play and powder even the guys reload guns. There are even Daniel Bernhardt from Bloodsport II and The Matrix Reloaded in it. And he was perfect in here and the fight scenes with Keanu Reeves were well done by him. This is the first time In the movie I see Willem Dafoe been the good guy. I haven't seen him in decades playing the good guy since Platoon (1986) my favorite Vietnam war movie! The last thing about the movie I want to say that John Wick was a dog lover and I love dogs. I love how he avenge the puppy's death by mobsters who killed him and than he saved another puppy from the animal shelter when he was wounded. He wasn't a superhero without any bruises on him he was wounded. Keanu Reeves did a wonderful job better than he did in Knock Knock (2015) I only hope they want screwed up the sequel and making much better action movie than the first was.When sadistic young thugs senselessly attack John Wick (Keanu Reeves)-a brilliantly lethal ex-assassin-they have no idea they've messed with the wrong guy. With New York City as his bullet-riddled playground, Wick embarks on a merciless rampage, hunting down his adversaries with the skill and ruthlessness that made him an underworld legend That is the main plot the rating I am giving this movie is a 10/10 because It deserves it.",10,159,234,19 November 2015
Underworld," The most awesome spectacular film in the series to be ever created!!!!
","Underworld (2003) is one of the most awesome excellent action horror films about Vampires and werewolves. It is the first entry in this fantasy-action franchise. It has Action, twists, romance and an awesome story tel. This is my second favorite film in the series. The first will be Underworld: Evolution (2006). There are two version of this film: Theatrical and the unrated version (Directors Cut) I prefer The unrated version that really makes this movie a hell of a lot better, story wise and action wise: P you learn so much stuff about everything, and you get a lot more action, plus you actually see in the end that Kraven is a coward, as you see him trying to find an exit everywhere.I was blown away by the action sequences and the overall story behind the warring factions. Lots of gratuitous violence and sexy ladies in black latex in leather doesn't hurt either. I love everything about this movie, the darkness, the action and the story. Plus Kate Beckinsale is not too bad to look at.Kate fits in this movie like a glove, she did an excellent job and She kicked ass! COMPLETE AWESOME mix of romance action and adventure!!!!!!! I LOVE it. I love all the twist and turns between the Vamps and the Werewolves. There hasn't been a story like this so it was nice to see something different. It was truly an awesome movie! One of my favorite vampire movies!!!! This is one of my all time favorite action vampire flicks. I love this genre and this story is fabulous. love the acting done by Beckinsale and Speedman, the history between werewolves and vampires is told very well! This is a great adaptation on the Gothic story of vampires with a great introduction to another fantasy race, the lycan. I love how the lycan have elements of werewolves with a close tie to the vampires. The action overall is intense from start to finish. What else can I say about Underworld that was already told? I love Kate Beckinsale as Seline (the Beautiful,sexy, tasty Kate Beckinsale)in her sweet & sexy supple, full-body-suit clad vampire Death Dealer. Scott Speedman as Michael Corvin a medical student who becomes a hybrid. Here is also Wentworth Miller as Adam Lockwood, a colleague of Michael's from Prison Break (2005) TV Series my awesome TV Show. Viktor: (Bill Nighy) he was made for this part, just an awesome performance by a great actor. Lucien (Michael Sheen) excellent performance by him, excellent character. Sophia Myles as Erika, Kraven's trusted ally and love interest portrayed perfectly she was like the only girl who was a vampire and noticed in this film, she acted her role as a real talent! Len Wiseman did a beautiful job writing a story and directing this film. He directed also Live Free or Die Hard (2007) my third best favorite Die Hard film. It is very imaginative and brilliant! The film is also violent, and somewhat bloody. But still entertains, it is fast paced film. I have a lot of funny with it. I love all the characters in here, the finale in the first Underworld is quite well done, in my opinion. The end of the film was brilliant, it did end with a cliffhanger but that makes you guessing more what will happened next. What will be in the sequel. In the Underworld, Vampires are a secret clan of modern aristocratic sophisticates whose mortal enemies are the Lycans (werewolves), a shrewd gang of street thugs who prowl the city's underbelly. No one knows the origin of their bitter blood feud, but the balance of power between them turns even bloodier when a beautiful young Vampire warrior and a newly-turned Lycan with a mysterious past fall in love. Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman star in this modern-day, action-packed tale of ruthless intrigue and forbidden passion ­ all set against the dazzling backdrop of a timeless, Gothic metropolis.Underworld is a 2003 action horror film directed by Len Wiseman about the secret history of Vampires and Lycans (an abbreviated form of lycanthrope). Underworld (2003) and Underworld: Evolution (2006) are my favorite films I just love both of them to death! 10/10 Grade: A Studio: Screen Gems, Lakeshore Entertainment Starring: Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly, Erwin Leder, Bill Nighy Director: Len Wiseman Producers: Tom Rosenberg, Gary Lucchesi, Richard Wright Screenplay: Danny McBride Story: Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman, Danny McBride Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hrs. 13 Mins.

Kickboxer," The best of Van Damme my favorite martial arts classic film of all time
","Kickboxer (1989) is one of the best martial arts films that Jean-Claude Van Damme ever made. I am a huge fan of Van Damme, I absolutely love this film to death! It is a cult classic film that Jean-Claude Van Damme made in to a star. Hard Target is Jean-Claude Van Damme's favorite number 1 film of mine this is my second favorite film of his. Bloodsport and Kickboxer are Van Damme's best films of the 80's he ever did. Since he edited Bloodsport himself and Cyborg flopped, Van Damme went and make this film that even today it is one of his best films of his career.After an US Champion Eric Sloane (Dennis Alexio who was a kickboxing champion in real life) and his brother Kurt Sloane (Jean-Claude Van Damme) travel to Thailand, Bangkok to fight the Thailand Champion Tong Po (Michel Qissi). In the ring the fight is different than in America in a Muay Thai style and Eric get's hurt and paralyzed for life by Tong Po. Van Damme is angrier and vows for revenge, so he meets this guy Vietnam vet retired Winston Taylor (Haskell V. Anderson III) who helps Van Damme on his mission. With the help of the Thai master Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) who becomes his teacher, trains him and getting him ready for the fight of his life. What can I say I love this movie to death, this movie kicks ass. It is great choreographed, it has no wires, just real action. Real fights they were all choreographed from Jean-Claude Van Damme him self. I love that the location was shot in Thailand and not in America. The director Mark DiSalle did a wonderful job directing this beautiful movie. David Worth was good by helping co directing it. Music was made from Paul Hertzog who made the music montage for Bloodsport. Trough inter film we se Van Damme training I love that, I love how Van Damme trains in the Stone City. The whole training montage was inspired from The Karate Kid and Rocky IV. Kickboxer defines my childhood I grew up watching Van Damme as a kid and Kickboxer is still my favorite film. Tong Po (Michel Qissi) is one of the best bad guys of all time. On the end of the film we se the last fight with Kurt and Tong Po in the 'ancient way', with a broken glass which it is a beautiful well choreographed. I love how Van Damme kick's and defats with martial arts Tong Po one of the best fights in the movie I ever seen. Van Damme dances while been drunk and kicks Freddy Li's fighters to the ground. Van Damme kicks a fighter in a tournament and deafets him in a kickbox match. I love the songs played in the film: Never Surrender, Fight for Love and Streets of Siam by Stan Bush. This movie spawned 4 sequels and 2 reboot films but no one of those films come near this movie. Don The Dragon Wilson can suck Van Damme's dick for challenging him Don your movies suck. Steven Seagal get your fat ass out of Van Damme way because Van Damme would have kicked your face with his technique to the ground on the dirt. 10 out of 10 Kickboxer is my all time favorite Jean-Claude Van Damme martial arts film and kicks ass, it is a cult classic film of all time. I love the cast, the direction I love everything about this film. I love this film to death.",10,87,111,12 March 2018
Dawn of the Dead," A good horror remake suspense film good as the original with a lot of scare
","This is a good remake is not better then the original film of course George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead (1978) is a classic but this film is a good follower and Sarah Polley is fantastic in her role. This is the only good movie Zack Snyder has ever done and I have been watching a lot this movie. I have it on Blu-ray disc and this film was really the first zombie film I saw before I purchase an watch the original film.The special effects were done by Heather Langenkamp from a Nightmare on Elm Street ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors and New Nightmare. My favorite heroine Nancy Thompson did special effects for the zombies for this movie. This is my all time favorite zombie horror film that I have watch it more then once Ving Rhames is also good likable character much better then he was in Undisputed.A mysterious virus is bringing the dead back to life as vicious re-animated corpses that go fast and feed upon the living. One morning, a nurse (Sarah Polly) escapes from her house after her husband was turned into a zombie as she escapes on the road only to be later crashed without being killed. She teams up with a reluctant police officer (Ving Rhames) whom helps her up and joins with other human survivors (Mekhi Pfeifer, Ty Burrell, Lindy Booth, Jake Weber, Michael Kelly, and Kevin Zegers) as they seek shelter in a large shopping mall. Unfortunately there is a few monsters inside that can be eliminated by a bullet to the skull, as now the living must try to survive as they battle out with the killer dead and try to find a way to escape.When i first heard back in late 2003 when George A. Romero's masterpiece 'Dawn of the Dead' from 1978 was going to be remade, i was really upset. I mean why mess with something that wasn't even broke in the first place? Then when i saw the trailer to it, i thought it might not be so bad. Afterall the original 1978 version is one of my favorite movies of all time, i did went to see this version in the theater and was pleasantly surprised of how well this was well made.This is a spectacular update of George A. Romero's classic and worked just like the 1990 remake to 'Night of the Living Dead' , this movie offers great performances by the cast and marks the debut of visionary Zack Sydner who gave us '300' and the upcoming 'Watchmen'. this movie is loaded with action and over the top gore like exploding heads, implements and of course the zombies here are fast like in the tradition of 'Return of the Living Dead', 'Nightmare City', 'Lifeforce' or 'The Stuff'. Although it misses out on the excellent social satire that made the original the classic it was, but this is a brilliant and fun re-imagining that is a solid winner.Score A 9/10 I would have give it 10 but the original George A. Romero movie is way better but for 2004 this I a great horror film.",9,1,1,3 September 2017
Iron Man 2," Not a great film to an original super action flick but not a bad film either!
","Iron Man 2 (2010) is not a great sequel to an original superhero Action films from 2008 portrayed on a comic books of Jon Favreau's Iron Man film from 2008. This film still delivers and is not that bad either. It is a good Action comic book superhero film but it is a lackluster sequel film. I am sorry Iron Man fans but it try's to be a good film, but it fails in some points. Robert Downey Jr. gives Iron Man 2 its fascination. The rest is a cluttered, clattering toy story. The general excellence of the casting trumps the inarguable excellence of the technology. This is a forgettable follow up to Iron Man and falls short on Part I in every way from its awful plot to its short action sequences, it is an awful movie but in some was it is still a good film. Iron Man 2 was a HUGE disappointment, it's the worst movie out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in my opinion and this sequel is rushed out. Iron Man 2 has lot's of problems I thought the last half got torn apart like it does.The best scenes are still the ones with Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Stark's charm-resistant assistant, Pepper Potts), or just Downey alone. The rest feels like padding, which is something a sleek-suited superhero shouldn't need. Not only that This film was rushed out and it was really too long. This film shouldn't have Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) in it, making a prequel in it. Terrence Howard been replaced by Don Cheadle. Tony acting like a jerk again. On his birthday party been all drunk in an Iron Man Suit, not caring about his company beside Pepper. Don Cheadle as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes stealing his suit and getting in to a fight with Tony was the worst idea and scene ever. Than they building weapons in the armor 'War Machine' that JUST WASN'T RIGHT. This film isn't the best portraying film ever by a comic book, which the original is way better than this film is. Natasha Romanoff lying and spying on Tony was wrong and judging Tony was wrong. Romanoff beats all Justin Hamme's bodyguards while Happy fights in a boxing fight with one bodyguard and barely beats him. While Natasha Romanoff is John Rambo one woman army, kills everyone. Come on guys she knows martial arts but she is not a super invincible woman. She is a human been vulnerable like me and you. In my opinion she stole Iron Man's scenes, Tony should have saved Pepper again and stop the bad guys alone. He had a help 'War Machine 'on the end of the film. I still prefer Iron Man (2008) to this film, sorry. Lame one liners, non stop explosions but no one ever gets hurt (especially not the innocent civilians), and a very predictable story line makes for a dull movie. Iron Man 2 with a lot of problems isn't the worst sequel and it isn't bad at all. It does have scene ways that turn's in to good. It has a good things too in it. Iron Man showed the world just how much energy, rhythm, humor, sincerity, and quality filmmaking and storytelling could be crammed into a Superhero movie that managed to satisfy both longtime series fans and newcomers in search not of the perfect comic book adaptation but merely a well-crafted Summer blockbuster that delivered the goods without sacrificing story. I like Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash I thought he did a perfect job portraying a super villain and arch enemy of Iron Man in this film! Which I personally, think he did a better acting than the rest of the crew did. He is a professional and he can act the way he was told too. The fights between Iron Man and Whiplash on the track race were cool. I really love that. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) is a combination of Iron Man's enemy the Crimson Dynamo (Dr Vanko, who wears weaponry/armour that can control electricity) and the supervillain Whiplash (who possesses a specially-designed razor/acid whip). That was awesome of making one of the most memorable super villains portraying by comic book even if it does have a little changes it is still good.I love the songs portrayed by AC/DC, the scores of the soundtrack a perfect to film. Even tough the film was not that good, I still did enjoyed in some scenes. Awesome cast, overpowering budget, & state of the art technology could do so much more, but by looking at the other reviews I'm certainly in the minority. The fights on the end of the film with CGI battling Iron Man with War Machine and successfully destroying the drones were terrific and I enjoyed with that. But that was all.Tough It was a A disappointing sequel and a disaster film I still like it and It was on a way still a good film, but the original was the best. I will still watch watch this film, even though it is a little let down but still watchable.

The Hunger Games," The best of all the four movies ever made from the novels!
","The Hunger Games (2012) the first movie of the series in my opinion is the best of all the four films ever made from the novels! I thought was pretty damn good awesome start of the series from it's books I love it and it is my favorite. Katniss killed three people in the first movie and she was very gorgeous talented and very intelligent. Is my favorite best film of the franchise, I own this movie on DVD and Blu-ray disc. Just my Blu-ray has a better quality. I love this movie and it is the best in the series I don't think the sequels are better than this movie, I am sorry I just don't agree with other opinions saying the sequels are better they are not. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) is pretty good damn sequel and that a good one, but not better than this one and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a true disappointment, I haven't seen Part 2 yet but I hope it is better than part 1. The first movie in the franchise is evolving in a Dystopian future every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the Capitol of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen volunteers in her younger sister's place and must rely upon her sharp instincts when she's pitted against highly trained Tributes who have prepared their entire lives. If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. I love the challenge and the game so much. For 2. Hrs I was entertained on my seat from the beginning till end. 'The Hunger Games' is a rare book-turned-movie that's able to live up to the gigantic hype of the book series it's based upon, while also standing out as a superbly crafted action blockbuster all its own. It's a marvelously entertaining thrill ride from start to finish that never forgoes its characters' humanity, nor does it ever abandon the strong political and social undertones of its source material. In the end, not only did this film exceed all my expectations of what a cinematic adaptation could accomplish, but it truly encapsulated everything I felt while reading the novel for the first time. I had no expectations for this film.. I thought it would be another 'Twilight', however I was so wrong. I actually enjoyed it. The plot was incredible, the acting was sublime. Incredible film that blew me away. I am honestly honored to have had the pleasure of watching it. Definitely going down on my personal movie list :P A triumph! The odds were actually in my favor this time :) I would definitely recommend this - it was amazing, and I was obsessed with the movie and cast for a while afterward. But you should read the book before you watch the movie, but that's just my opinion ;) Jennifer Lawrence is amazing, gorgeous as Katniss Everdeen, very, very beautiful talented and sexy. She did amazing perfect job playing her character, this is the second time I memorized her in famous role. The second famous role she played was Raven Darkholme/Mystique in X-Men: First Class and X-Men: Days of Future Past. I heard that The Hunger Games quadrilogy and X-Men trilogy are the last movies of the franchise she will ever play. Than she will start playing in stand up alone roles. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy did an outstanding performance of acting his character. I had no idea Woody Harrelson will be in this movie and he did a job so well. This is a great futuristic Dystopian science fiction film. The people in the Capitol enjoy the Hunger Games, for them its their yearly highlight:) But for the poor people from the District it's a punishment. I did enjoyed some action sequences and clever intense scenes, like Katniss been on a tree and than climbs up the tree towards the nest and begins sawing at the branch holding it up, until the nest of venom wasps fall down and kills Glimmer (Leven Rambin) who stung too many times by wasps. It is hard to believe people would want to watch kids battle to the death, but in the Dystopian future is everything possible. This movie gets 10 by me for been a fun solid not boring Dystopian Science Fiction action flick by the novel. The Hunger Games is a 2012 American dystopian science fiction adventure film directed by Gary Ross and based on the novel of the same name by Suzanne Collins. It is the first installment in The Hunger Games film series and was produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik, with a screenplay by Ross, Collins, and Billy Ray.10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Lionsgate Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland Director: Gary Ross Screenplay: Suzanne Collins, Gary Ross, Billy Ray Based on The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins Producers: Nina Jacobson, Jon Kilik Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 22 Mins.

12 Monkeys," 12 Monkeys is the best modern sci-fi classic!
","12 Monkeys (1995) is the best modern sci-fi classic flick! This is the finest sci-fi movie of all time and I love this film to death! It is my favorite best Bruce Willis flick alongside with Die Hard, Sin City, The Fifth Elemen and The Jackal, 12 Monkeys Delivers! The movie it self is a modern sci- fi classic that does involve travel into the past, so it immediately presents a time-travel paradox which can't really be resolved. In order to even try watching this movie, you MUST LOOK PAST THE PARADOX. If you don't, this movie has zero credibility, and is not worth your time.This movie is about Bruce Willis who stars as a prison inmate from the future who is sent back in time to stop a deadly virus from decimating the world's population. Brad Pitt delivers an Academy Award-nominated performance as a lunatic in an asylum. Directed by Terry Gilliam. An unknown and lethal virus has wiped out five billion people in 1996. Only 1% of the population has survived by the year 2035, so now the Year is 2035. A prison inmate gets a chance to travel back in time to gathering information about an army 12 monkeys and stop them at all cost. But something goes terrible wrong and he is sent back in the year 1990, 6.years earlier and he is now shipped off in to mental institution asylum where there he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) a lunatic in an asylum. The movie has two parts in here. The first part is set in 1990 Asylum and the second part is set 1996 on the airport before the deadly virus is released out. The movie explains the army of 12 monkeys were not responsible for deadly virus but was someone else. I will not tell you who it was you will have to find out for your self who it was.I found this to be one of the more enjoyable movies I have seen in quite a bit. The acting is excellent and I must say that Brad Pitt plays his part brilliantly. The story is good and keep you guessing all the way through. All in all, this is a movie that takes you for an intriguing ride and leaves you with a bit to think about. This was Brad Pitt's second famous role after he finished Se7en another mystery thriller flick. The film has a mystery in it, it keeps guessing you what will happened next what will Cole (Bruce Willis) do to stop Jeffrey (Brad Pitt) and his army of 12 monkeys. This is a movie you have to watch repeatedly to get the full scale of what is going on and who's what when and where. That requires some level of patience and understanding so be prepared. Madeleine Stowe did a perfect outstanding job of acting in this movie.The main actors set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. This movie is what is a perfect 10 and it will always be a solid Sci-Fi flick even the series of 12 Monkeys was released out this year and the first season is already completed!' I wish Sci-Fi movies like this one would be made today. Btw Director Terry Gilliam was brilliant and imaginative who directed the most perfectly movie field with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, CGI effects and the story with script that delivers. It is mind blowing, entertaining, and just plain crazy! Plus it has monkeys in it! It is really funny to see Pitt before his TROY/MR. SMITH days. If you really want a shocker look up Pitt in 'The Wrong Side of the Tracks' with Rick Schroeder. Anyway, this movie rocks. Willis puts in a good performance, and all the characters give this movie a creepy feel. It is kind of like Mad Max, except a city landscape and weird scientists instead of Tina Turner. Although most modern 'the future was destroyed by a virus' movies are more realistic, this movie is still fun to watch given that it was made in 1995.12 Monkeys, also known as Twelve Monkeys, is a 1995 American neo-noir science fiction film directed by Terry Gilliam, inspired by Chris Marker's 1962 short film La Jetée, and starring Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, and Brad Pitt, with Christopher Plummer and David Morse in supporting roles.10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Universal Pictures, Atlas Entertainment, Classico Starring: Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, Brad Pitt, Christopher Plummer and Jon Seda Director: Terry Gilliam Screenplay: David Peoples, Janet Peoples, Based on La jetée by Chris Marker Producer: Charles Roven Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hrs. 09 Mins.

Rocky V," One of the worst Rocky movies ever made!
","Rocky V is definitely one of the worst Sport Drama movies I ever saw in the series. It is not even a sport film to me! It is a sad satire story! What the hell happened in here? Rocky IV was such a Entraining Action sport film, this is a disaster and over long boring train wreck! It is just not the Rocky we grew up with it. This movie can't compare to the past Rocky movies. It seems to take everything Rocky worked hard for and throw it out the window. He loses all his money and he also seems to forget he has a son, even though that was a big event in Rocky II. Also, why is his son like 10 years older that he was in Rocky IV, wasn't Rocky only gone for a few months. Rocky quitting boxing, he suffered from brain damage I just hate that. Again I also had a major problem with Adrian's character. The same that I was angry on her in Rocky II for not been supportive, here is she even worse than ever! She was a completely different person and her chemistry with Rocky did not show in this movie. In Rocky V she suddenly becomes very assertive, even when dealing with the press and in public situations. This is totally contrary to the reserved, shy character we had known previously. I think this change in character was a big reason the chemistry between her and Rocky did not work.Then we get to Rocky V, and find that because of his incredibly stupid brother in law, Rocky ends up completely broke and destitute, ending right back where he started in his old neighborhood. As if it were all for nothing. Who really wants to see a study of a hero's fall into depravity? I don't. Ending the series at Rocky IV would have been the best decision. The things I liked in the movie was the opening scene, showing his match from Rocky IV and shows him in the Russia Moscow still showering and than he can't stop shaking his hands. I love the Rocky, Paulie attending press conference. I love that Rocky moves to a working-class Philadelphia neighborhood where he grew up as child. I love how Rocky Balboa Jr. fights off of two bullies and starts training by uncle Paulie I love that. Until he face them and fight's back, I love that scene. I love Elisebeth Peters as Jewel, Robert's Girlfriend she was so beautiful in the film. What happened to the actress who played Jewel where did she went?. I think the script and the changes of the fifth installment just really hurt the film so much. It is just a poor sad story of a depressed Drama that is just not Rocky! Anyway, I don't want to write anymore and leaving any more spoilers in here, and I don't want to insult the film, because I love Rocky. One last thing: even Sylvester Stallone agrees that film is awful, the producers even wanted to kill the Rocky character off. Sly was very disappointed with the film's release and he waited 16. years until he made a successful sequel Rocky Balboa a big improvement over Rocky V. The rating is 4/10 because it did had some moments. It is a shame that two actors died who played in this movie: Sage Stallone Sly's son and Tommy Morrison who played Tommy 'Machine' Gunn both died separately and they are both missed. R.I.P. ! Rocky V is a 1990 American sports drama film. The fifth film in the Rocky series, written by and starring Sylvester Stallone, and co-starring Talia Shire, Stallone's real life son Sage, and real life boxer Tommy Morrison, with Morrison in the role of Tommy Gunn, a talented yet raw boxer.4/10 Grade: A Studio: United Artists, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Sage Stallone, Tommy Morrison, Richard Gant, Burgess Meredith Director: John G.

Spider-Man 2," The Best Spider-Man sequel and the best superhero movie!
","Spider-Man 2 (2004) is Sam Raimi's the best spectacular sequel Marvel's Action superhero film ever and It is Way Better Than the First! I am sorry but I think Spider-Man 2 is way better Than The Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2. It may take a while for the action to start up in Spidey 2, but when it does it's great. This sequel deals on the inner turmoil our protagonist must face not only as Spider-Man, but as an adult living in the real world -- a nice contrast by the writer. The new villain, Doc Oc, is way better than The Green Goblin could ever hope to achieve. He's a struggling soul just as Spidey, only his has been focused on better achieving what he failed to do, as is Spidey -- saving the world after the death of his uncle. The script here is great. The acting is once again, very well done -- Simmon's character is wonderful. The music is basically the same from the first, a misstep by the composer Danny Elfman. Overall, this is a great sequel and could very well exist had the first not been made.Spider-Man (2002) was fun. I mean really, really fun. However, it was weighed down by the prospect that it took itself too seriously. Spider-Man 2 takes all the fun of Spider-Man and throws away the cheese. That is not to say that those shallow moments are entirely gone, but at least Spider-Man 2 knows exactly what kind of movie it is. Spider-Man 2 starts out a lot slower than Spider-Man does, but when the ball gets rolling, man is it worth the wait! The characters are more developed, the action is so poetic it's almost like watching a synchronized dance, and the story contains more drama and humor. Real humor. The funny moments here are less laughable and more funny, let's just say. Also, where Spider-Man contained some, well, 'objectionable' content, Spider-Man 2 is surprisingly chaste. Here is one of those rare occasions where the sequel outdoes the original in every aspect. Swing us away, Spidey! CONTENT: Much stylized action violence; mild language; a few low tops. WHO: Teens and up. Now this is what a superhero movie should be. 'Spider-Man 2' believes in its story in the same way serious comic readers believe, when the adventures on the page express their own dreams and wishes. It's not camp and it's not nostalgia, it's not wall-to-wall special effects and it's not pickled in angst. It's simply and poignantly a realization that being Spider-Man is a burden that Peter Parker is not entirely willing to bear.I wish more people could see and appreciate the heart displayed in Spider-Man 2. I love this film I love It the most so much because his life was really hard and because Doc Ock gosh I love him. The film it self more focus on a characters and the same time does the story. The film is struggles more Peter's life and what it Is life as Spider-Man and life as Peter Parker. His life is such a stress and he is trying everything, he even get's to stressful so he loses his powers. The film wasn't focusing only on Peter's life It was also focusing on Mary Jane, Harry Osborn and Dr. Otto Octavius. I love Spider-Man 1 & 2 tough Spider-Man (2002) has flaws and it isn't portrayed by comic books. That is why I prefer The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) over Spider-Man (2002)even tough I do Like the first film. 'I believe there's a hero in all of us.' In Spider-Man 2, the latest installment in the blockbuster Spider-Man series, based on the classic Marvel Comics hero, Tobey Maguire returns as the mild-mannered Peter Parker, who is juggling the delicate balance of his dual life as college student and a superhuman crime fighter. Peter's life becomes even more complicated when he confronts a new nemesis, the brilliant Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) who has been reincarnated as the maniacal and multi-tentacled 'Doc Ock.' When Doc Ock kidnaps MJ (Kirsten Dunst), Spider-Man must swing back into action as the adventure reaches new heights of unprecedented excitement.The movie demonstrates what's wrong with a lot of other superhero epics: They focus on the superpowers, and short-change the humans behind them.'Spider-Man 2' is the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with 'Superman' (1978). It succeeds by being true to the insight that allowed Marvel Comics to upturn decades of comic-book tradition: Readers could identify more completely with heroes like themselves than with remote godlike paragons. Peter Parker was an insecure high school student, in grade trouble, inarticulate in love, unready to assume the responsibilities that came with his unexpected superpowers. It wasn't that Spider-Man could swing from skyscrapers that won over his readers; it was that he fretted about personal problems in the thought balloons above his Spidey face mask.Spider-Man 2 is a 2004 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi and written by Alvin Sargent from a story by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Michael Chabon. The sequel to the 2002 film Spider-Man, it is the second film in Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy based on the fictional Marvel Comics character of the same name. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco reprise their respective roles as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Mary Jane Watson, and Harry Osborn.I love this film and It kicks Ass! 10/10 Score: Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Columbia Pictures Corporation, Marvel Enterprises, Laura Ziskin Productions Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Alfred Molina, Rosemary Harris, Donna Murphy Director: Sam Raimi Producers: Avi Arad, Laura Ziskin Screenplay: Alvin Sargent Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 7 Mins.

The Fifth Element," Easily one of Bruce Willis best action sci-fi fllm of all time!
","The Fifth Element (1997) is one of the best sci-fi movies in my mind! This movie never gets old to watch no matter how many times I see it. In my opinion it is Bruce Willis best sci-fi action flick. I always loved this sci-fi action packed flick and I always will. I watch it more than 20.times in the row. This movie is amazing. I realized this year I think that the protagonist and antagonist never meet, and I think that's awesome. This movie has too many awesome aspects to list, and it's one of those movies where I get sad when the end credits come on. And it makes me angry that a movie so awesome doesn't get talked about. I got to look up the screenwriter and see what else they have done because movies this awesome are rare. I just love the look (cinematography), the cast, the special effects, the acting, the costumes (Jean-Paul Gaultier...just excellent stuff), the humor, the score. I remember that everybody in the movie theatre was completely silent when the blue alien was singing:) The Fifth Element will always be my favorite Sci-Fi movie, I will always enjoy this movie, it is gun and Entertaining. Movies like this one they aren't today anymore. I also love the film. It's a lot of fun. Love the cast, effects and music. It is a dam good movie. It has very well-made CGI effects that looks so breathtaking, great story, good characters especially Bruce Wills and Milla Jovovich. The use of miniatures, and prosthetics, then the added layer of CGI is what creates a more believable image. This movie was shot more than 18 years ago and still looks good and better than the films coming out today! A surprisingly awesome action scenes, funny dialogue, everything! I was amazed how this film was gonna turn out back then, considering the comparison with 'Star Wars'. Luc Besson also gave us such classics as The Professional. Fifth Element sees Bruce Willis as the reluctant hero who is thrust into protecting Milla Jovovich who happens to be such the 5th element before the evil Zorg played by Gary Oldman finds her for his own master purposes. Filled with stunning visual effects and some good old fashioned adventure this one is still as fun to watch now as it was back in '97. Luc Besson really stood out from the trend. It has to be said that back in 1997 it was all about the Fifth Element, an amazing French blockbuster which people eventually got tired of... Strangely enough, it was coldly received in the US. It's so different in many ways, the visual aspect is brilliant, the cast is great (featuring bigwigs Maïwenn and Mathieu Kassovitz as the robber) and too few Sci-Fi movies can claim to be funny and entertaining.The Things I have enjoyed was a wonderful humor, great special effects and memorable characters who create a brilliant tongue in cheek a Sci- Fi flick! That you will find worth watching the fifth time as much as the first. I love about everything that is in this film./: Before Milla Jovovich became Alice in Resident Evil Series she was Leeloo The Fifth Element. The action is very gore I am surprised that this movie was rated PG-13. Gary Oldman as Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg did an outstanding acting performance in the movie I have ever seen. Gary Oldman also played in The Professional (1994) action thriller flick with Jean Reno. Timeless: Good versus Evil, with a little romance and ass-kicking thrown in for good measure! Set design and costumes are awesome, the characters are priceless (Chris Tucker!), this movie is just a lot of fun to watch! Sadly Luc Besson does not make any good movies today like is this one The Fifth Element.New York cab driver Korben Dallas didn't mean to be a hero, but he just picked up the kind of fare that only comes along every five thousand years: A perfect beauty, a perfect being, a perfect weapon. Now, together, they must save the world. Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and Gary Oldman star in acclaimed director Luc Besson's outrageous sci-fi adventure, an extravagantly styled tale of good against evil set in an unbelievable twenty-third century world. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CGI.The Fifth Element (French: Le Cinquième Élément) is a 1997 English-language French science fiction action film directed and co-written by Luc Besson. It stars Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman and Milla Jovovich.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Gaumont Buena Vista International, Columbia Pictures Starring: Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm, Chris Tucker Director: Luc Besson Producer: Patrice Ledoux Screenplay: Luc Besson, Robert Mark Kamen Story by Luc Besson Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 06 Mins.

Batman Returns," Batman Returns is dark, violent and a worthy sequel to the 1989 Batman.
","One of the darker films ever made. It is one of my personal favorite Batman movies. Batman Returns is dark, violent and a worthy sequel to the 1989 Batman. Danny DeVito gave a brilliant performance as The Penguin. The only two good things in this movie are return of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Danny DeVito as The Penguin. I thought classic original Batman (1989) was way better film than this. Batman Returns is my second favorite Batman film in the franchise. The film has a many problems in here I didn't like and it annoys me, but there are other things I did like and love in the second installment.Things I don't like in this film: Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle/ Catwoman she was extremely violent woman. I still couldn't believe how could an grown aged woman act like a child, trying to be an animal and than she just rip off a harmless pet rubber animals stuff them in a sinker , destroying a doll house, spraying a t-shirt and than acting that she is the queen in this movie? She wasn't written and portrayed by the comic books like was Anne Hathaway in The Dark Knight Rises. Selina Kyle was never a secretary like she was in Shreck Company, she wasn't a vigilante, violent or angry woman. She was a cat burglar and a thief. She didn't went around cutting people like she did in this film, she only did what was necessary to do for survival. That is the main problem in this film. I still prefer and think Kim Basinger is much better better actress than Michelle Pfeifer is and I still love Vicky Vale much better than Selina Kyle. Sorry Bat fans. I wish there wouldn't be Max Shreck in this film because he look's like a selfish lunatic person. Those are the main problems I don't like in this film, that is why this movie is not better than his superior predecessor. Things I do like in this film:The Action sequences are outstanding and awesome and Fight sequences are fantastic. The first fight between Batman and Catwoman is awesome. The film is very dark which I love that in the film. Michael Keaton reprise his role back as Bruce Wayne/Batman. It is my childhood film and I will always watch it. It was a big hit in 1992 when the film come out, there were different times then, than they are today. The story centers around Christmas Eve. The Penguin, releases several bats that fly frantically around the girl's (Ice Princess) head, causing her to lose her balance and fall, but giving the impression that Batman, visible to the crowd below, had pushed her. She lands on the tree switch, lighting it up and unleashing a flurry of bats that the Penguin had hidden within the branches. Batman attempts to flee. I love that Batman flees in this film around Bats flying the crowd. It shows his symbol stands for Bat which he is a Batman. He also try to save that girl when she was kidnapped but couldn't. The Penquin and Catwoman becomes alley and they set up Batman to be a criminal. I love how The Penguin had placed a control device under the car that let he himself steer it from an arcade-style car hidden in a trailer. Batman, helpless, is trapped behind the wheel of the Batmobile as it veers through the streets, knocking over city property and frightening citizens. Batman manages to remove the control device before anyone is killed, and returns home. That is the best awesome scene I have seen. Batskiboat using in this film that batman drives on the sewer was FANTASTIC! Beside Batmobil there was other vehicle used in this film. Batman saving all the children from Penquin was also awesome. Batman was a real hero in this film. There was no Robin in here. Which I am happy about it. Batman does not need any sidekick to help him out. I hate Robin, don't get me wrong I don't like that character and I never did. Michael Keaton Is excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman his acting performance to me in both Burton films is better than Christian Bale is. Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne was a clearly uncomfortable man, a mumbling solitary eccentric, ill at ease in his own skin and with other people. In the Batsuit, though, he becomes the beast he really is, an imposing personification of vengeance and fear, despite his slighter frame. There's something far more sympathetic about Keaton's Bruce Wayne. Maybe it's because he was never recorded throwing a wobbler on set. Tim Burton did a great job directing and producing the second Batman film. I love the costume designer by Bo Welch for Catwoman, Batman and Penquin. J. P. Morgan's wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck's costume design. I think those three actors Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeifer did a great character chemistry and good acting performance. CGI was also not bad for the bats I real love it. I love this film not as much as I love The Dark Knight and Batman but I still love it. The rating I give to this film is 10/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD action film.",10,107,219,11 October 2015
Blade," The best vampire slaying movie ever my number one favorite Blade film
","Blade (1998) is the best action/horror vampire slaying movie ever made! I always have enjoyed watching Blade. My number one favorite Blade film I love this film to death. It is one of the best action sci-fi films of all time. Wesley Snipes best role till it's days ever! No one can play Blade like Wesley Snipes did! Blade is not an origin story, but it is a real world of darkness. Blade is just so bad and anti-hero which is perfect for the world he drives in. It is my favorite comic book Vampire movie. I love this film, I love the action and I love everything in it! I love Wesley Snipes and Kris Kris Kristofferson so much they have such a chemistry between each other. Wesley Snipes Kicks ass!!!!! This is the most super hero Vampire slayer film ever made!  It is been so long since I last watch this film. I kept watching it 11.year ago in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was been released I kept watching Blade 1 and 2 on my CD on my computer and on VHS tape that I had this film. Blade of trilogy was the only film I owned on VHS I did not owned Blade II or Blade: Trinity at that time, but I have now the whole trilogy on Blu-ray. The best dang vampire slaying movie ever (say that fast five times)! Its funny too, it shows him killing a bunch of vampires but then regular people are thinking that he is killing humans! I watch this film as a child and all the blood in it and the violence made me crunch. I grew up with this film, 11.years ago kept constantly watching this film over and over, till it's days it is my favorite best Vampire flick. Blood and the crunch in this movie is AWESOME!! Just awesome! So In this movie Blade is a half human, half vampire, hybrid he protects the human race from other vampires and in this movie he has to stop Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff). Deacon Frost wants to resurrect the blood god 'La Magra', And he needs Blade's blood and he needs 12 volunteers. So that he can walk in the sunlight and declares extinction to human race. Blade is humanity's last hope!Wesley Snipes plays a half-mortal, half-immortal charged with ridding the earth of a race of vampires led by Stephen Dorff in this action-packed blockbuster.This movie right here oh my god! is this movie AWESOME! Watching this as kid you really don't know much, other that Wesley Snipes is a Bad Ass!!!! But now when you are older you can really know how much of a bad ass Blade really was and he does making a point! Wesley Snipes is AWESOME! Yes awesome!So yea... Wesley Snipes does a good job in this movie, everyone does a great job in this movie, so far, even Donal Logue as Quinn with a long hair and beard hi did a wonderful job. Stephen Dorff is actually pretty good, I haven't really seen much of Stephen Dorff's work yet, I'm pretty sure he is not even around today, I am not sure what happened today, I'm not sure if he just drop off the map or if he just quit acting all together, but yea. You would never guess this was MARVEL movie because MARVEL's name was nowhere near this property so far. So that was kind a odd to see this choice but yea, we all knew who he is anyways, so that become kind a cool, and yea violence, blood, the gore amazingly AWESOME!!!!! Yea, I brought the word amazingly back. It is crazy, over the top, sword fights, knives throwing's, all this wrapped in the one and you get that final fight between him and Deacon, dang that is good time! That is good awesome times you know. And it is just nothing like that right now and I am hoping that we get another sequel to Blade: Trinity. The actress Arly Jover who played Mercury, Deacon Frost's girlfriend was so sexy and hot and she is so awesome with her hair and changing her hair styles for 11.years I was confused with a thought that Deacon's girlfriend was played by Traci Lords because she is blonde. It took me so long to figure it that out, that it was Arly Jover played Deacon's girlfriend and not Tracy Lords. What I like about the character Blade are his gadjets, the sharp ones in particular and his outfit and style! Bottom of line It is my favorite best film still I think Blade II is a little better than Blade, but I still love the trilogy. Movies like this don't exist today. The rating I give to Blade is 10/10",10,109,124,30 October 2015
Creed," This movie sucks ass, I don't get the praise and the hype for this film!
","Creed (2015) for me personally sucks! I am really disappointed with this film! It is not a good film, not a Rocky film. For my opinion this film ruined Rocky nostalgia films for me. After watching Creed I login to make a review for this film, I hate this film. I would rather watch Rocky Balboa, Rocky I, Rocky IV, Southpaw, Million Dollar Baby with Clint Eastwood, Grudge Match Rocky II, III and even V as a time waster, those movies are far way better films for me. Southpaw kills Creed for me! I don't get the hype and praise for this movie! What is so good about this film that Rocky sequels are so bad to this movie? I did not see the point in Creed at all. I haven't hear any inspired speech in the entire film at all. I don't like Stallone in this movie I think this is the worst performance of his as Rocky Balboa. He doesn't do anything trough whole film except winning Paulie is dead, Adrian is dead. Why was a clip in this movie from Rocky II and not Rocky I? is beyond me. They disgraced Apollo's name by saying that he had an affair with other woman, and he cheated his wife, why? Trough entire Rocky films I never hear or saw that. The third fight Rocky reveals that Apollo won why? please why? I always though Rocky and Apollo are tied not that Apollo won the third fight! The training sequences where absolutely terrible for me. Why did Stallone won an Oscar for his performance as Rocky Balboa and critics are pressing him by saying this is his best performance?! Really? What about Rocky Balboa (2006)? 'It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!' I love Rocky Balboa and Stallone wrote 10 years ago and directed the sixth Rocky film and he did not won anything, but suddenly he has nothing to do with another Rocky film and get's an Oscar for it?! Why? That is wrong!!!! I love Rocky Balboa and in my opinion Rocky Balboa ended perfectly the nostalgia franchise and Creed did not do that, it ruined it! This film is about some rich guy who has a nice life and a beautiful job, gets a promotion and he quits to become a boxer, than he goes to Philadelphia to find Rocky Balboa and fight professional wow that sound's awesome not! This film is awful. Southpaw is MILES way better film than Creed is, it is about a guy a champion who loses everything after his wife's death, his title, his respect, his daughter and his wealth everything. Than he goes back to the roots and he fights to get everything in life he once had including his daughter back, he has to fight in a court and in ring with his toughest opponent to gain respect, I love that movie. I haven't seen anything in Creed like that.Rocky has a cancer now, wow, Adrian is dead and Paulie for some reason is dead now! Robert doesn't have anything to do with Rocky anymore. Where is Marie she isn't in this film at all! Where is Duke in this movie? He isn't even mentioned at all. Creed is far worst to me than Rocky V, at least in Rocky V you have Adrian, Paulie, Duke and Robert alive in it, in here you have absolutely nothing. The problem with this movie was also with Adonis Creed character (to not mention his girlfriend), I simply couldn't relate and care for him in any way, I feel that Jordan was a miscast for that role, his acting felt very forced and weak IMO. I think as well that this was a rather unnecessary revival of the series which ruined the established. Creed's girlfriend in this film was terrible why did Creed even had a girlfriend in this movie? If he wouldn't had any girlfriend here, he would get my respect. What happened to Danny 'Stuntman' Wheeler (Andre Ward)? He knocked Adonis in L.A. and he only had two scenes in the film and that it was all. This movie is too long it is over hyped, mediocre and boring love drama film! Michael B. Jordan? I like the actor...but for me? He was One Note. I'm sorry, I just don't see what people saw in it. The fights? Done well Technically...but I felt Nothing. I felt no Heart, I felt no Passion, I felt no Energy, and I felt no Adrenaline.Rocky Balboa (2006) is MILES much way better movie, better story, better music. I don't need to see this I have Rocky Balboa. So my bottom of line is you can have Creed I will take Rocky Balboa. You can have Creed there you go that is fine, I will take Rocky Balboa anytime. ' It Ain't Over 'til It's Over. Where's that from, the 80's? That's probably the 70's.'F 1 out 10 for the worst sport boxing movie and Stallone isn't that good, honestly? I would even rather watch The Expendables 3 I saw twice that movie and at least I like something in that movie, I did not like nothing in here!",1,6,12,12 June 2016

The Mummy," The Mummy is the best movie epic action nonstop ride!
","The Mummy (1999) is my favorite true nonstop action epic movie!!! Filled with dazzling visual effects, top-notch talent and superb storytelling. It was the second movie i went to see in the theaters in 1999 with my mom as a kid. I was just a teen than I have enjoyed this movie a lot. The first movie in 1999 I went to see in theaters was The Matrix (1999) with also my mom and I have enjoyed both of this movie. Every time I am watching it, I still enjoy it! I had no idea it was a remake of 1932 film The Mummy. I never watched movies from 1938. There were spawned 2 sequels and one prequel/spin-off film. I love and I like both of the sequels on their own way and I hate the prequel/spin-off film. 'The Mummy' (1999) was one of the finest Fantasy action adventures of all time. For the Mummy, achieving that level of serio-comic entertainment was unprecedented, and I still do not think it has been duplicated. All the witty dialogue, near perfect script, Dr. Bey... This was a very adult movie, but also for children too, and therefore accessible at different levels. The comments by Ebert, and co. were silly at best, as we have an example of critics turning up their nose at a great film, just to be 'in', be smiled upon by the academy, etc. It was therefore a poor review, a poor appraisal by the twain: this time you should not have used them. I am keep hearing that this movie is getting a reboot now with Tom Cruise in it but why? Why rebooting this movie? It is stupid! The reboot will fail, even with Tom Cruise in it and It will be rated PG-13 and It want be so good like this movie is. 'The Mummy' is more Fantasy than Sci-Fi, and really perhaps should be classified as Fantasy Drama. Nonetheless, the rebooting of 'The Mummy' by Stephen Sommers in 1999 would top, or near top, any list in which it is appropriately placed. ... And that ridiculous quote by Ebert & Co,, that this movie was 'the son of... the son of ... Raiders of the Lost Ark' is sheer nonsense. This is to imply it is derivative. In a broad sense, all movies are 'derivative', and indeed so was Raiders. It does have a great amount of CGI effects, Yet there were real stages, too, I have learned: such as at Dracula's 'Ball': This was held in some Medieval Church, if I recollect accurately. I thought that the effects were good, though the viewer is perhaps surfeited with them. (...) Nonetheless, though bothering me initially, when I came to 'understand' this film, I look past it now. How much money do you want the producers and the studio to have to spend...? I thought was in perfect harmony with the plot, being grandly that of Good vs. Evil.This film, and unlike his 'The Mummy' of a few years prior, is not 'immediately accessible' and does take repeated viewings to enjoy. This due to the plot's complexity, to appreciate the humor, and to appreciate the acting. Stephen Sommers did well with this movie but did very poorly with the GI Joe movie.I think people take 'The Mummy' remake too seriously. It has great special effects that hold up pretty well, charming performances (especially Brendon Frasier, who I'm surprised didn't become a HUGE star after that kind of leading man performance/success. I mean he was pretty much was the Christ Pratt of that era and should have had the type of career upgrade Pratt is getting now. The dialogue is hilarious and very entertaining. I mean we're not talking a classic Oscar winning film here, but an irresistibly fun blockbuster that holds up well 16 years later. So the actors in this movie were good and the story including the directors were great. Everybody in this movie did a great job. This is one of the best movies ever made. It doesn't get much better than Brendan Fraser battling a 3,000 year old mummy. The action and the Special effects CGI are great. Brendan Fraser did a terrific job playing Rick' O'Connell a Legionnaire adventurer who served in the French Foreign Legion turned out a deserter and later a prisoner, he did outstanding acting performance as a bad ass action hero on the screen! Rachel Weisz as Evie Carnahan did an outstanding and a perfect job as a shy but intelligent Egyptologist. Arnold Vosloo as High Priest Imhotep and the Mummy was fantastic, he is such an underrated actor. Gosh he was even so good in Hard Target (1993) my favorite Jean-Claude Van Damme/John Woo movie. Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni Gabor a former soldier in the French Foreign Legion was just awesome and I loved his performance in the film. Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay the leader of Medjai was incredible outstanding. This movie is what it is a perfect Adventure movie a like Indiana Jones but a bit too underrated, that shouldn't have been. Deep in the Egyptian desert, a handful of people searching for a long-lost treasure have just unearthed a 3,000 year old legacy of terror. I am giving this 10/10 for been entertaining summer blockbuster action/adventure/fantasy movie! The best one in the series.The Mummy is a 1999 American action adventure horror film written and directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Kevin J.

Constantine," The most highly anticipated supernatural horror film of my life!
","Constantine (2005) in my opinion is an underrated Comic Book Film and one of my favorite anticipated supernatural horror flicks of my life. Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz reunite in this flick, after 9.years later when they both made together Chain Reaction (1996) one of my favorite sci-fi action flick. Anyway beside End of Days (1999) with Schwarzenegger in the starring role, Constantine is the only supernatural horror film that I know and like. After just watching this film I must say is a far way million times better than overrated The Exorcist (1973) that everyone highly praises that film. I love this movie to death and it is my fifth favorite best Keanu Reeves movie. John Constantine is iconic character that I think that Keanu Reeves did impressive acting performance, including way better job than he did in movies he is doing this days.I love this film. It has nice, thoroughly believable action for this sort of supernatural fare, and attractive leads in the shape of Keanu & Rachel, supported by Tilda Swinton as god's right-hand, Gabriel (reprising her Orlando persona). It looks great too and does the merging of separate worlds (Earth and Hell) very well. Keanu plays an embittered exorcist with a 30 a day habit and some caustic barbs for anyone he runs into. Rachel Weisz enters as a cop with some private history of her own connected with the occult world, and soon the two of them are drawn towards apocalypse & hell on earth. It's a throughly enjoyable purchase if you like the big theme Good Vs Evil, with the usual blurring, devils, angels, and shotguns firing holy shot. The CGI is also up to scratch, which isn't something you can always say on films being made even in 2008. Very, very enjoyable so long as you appreciate the subject matter and don't expect massive gun-battles, stop frame kung-fu, bullet time etc. An absolutely superb film. Keanu Reeves plays his role perfectly to his characters identity. Interesting throughout I was gripped to this film from start to finish. One of the best comic adaptations without a doubt.This is the type of comic book movie that I like to see; R rated, good action scenes, badass main character (and in Constantine case he sure is one considering that Devil himself will come to collect his soul), actors who actually do their job right, good direction, good score, no unnecessary bullshit subplots that are not needed and only extend the running time, great cinematography and visuals, and some decent practical effects. CGI maybe doesn't hold up but I personally don't have any problems with it in this case. My only problems with the film are again all the hate that it gets. I still don't get the hate for this film, I love the storyline , the action and the twists. Specially this is Keanu Reeves I see in here. 10.years ago he was a promise actor now he is a sold out washed up actor who just doesn't care about his fans any more. He keeps wearing long hair and he has a beard + he can't act anymore. Watch Knock Knock (20015) and you will see what I am talking about.Constantine tells the story of John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), a man who has literally been to hell and back. When he teams up with skeptical policewoman Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) to solve the mysterious suicide of her twin sister, their investigation takes them through the world of demons and angels that exists just beneath the landscape of contemporary Los Angeles. Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldly events, the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost.That's the basic plot. It is more apocalyptic movie that means end of the world. Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) the archangel believes that by bringing Hell to Earth, humans can become worthy of Gods love through repentance and faith. The movie has everything, ghosts, demons, arch angels it even has Lucifer (Peter Stormare) in it. Rachel Weisz did a perfect outstanding job as female lead in this movie. I seriously love her performance and I love Keanu Reeves. Shia LaBeouf also did a perfect job as Chas Kramer, Constantine's friend and helper, I feel sad that he had to die by the end of the movie and his character was killed off.Overall I am giving this movie 10/10 because this movie deserves it and it doesn't need to be hated for it by critics or fans. The movie was fun and I have enjoy it!",10,88,108,17 November 2015
X-Men," Awesome MARVEL comic book superhero film ever!
","X-Men (2000) is MARVEL comic book superhero Action Science Fiction Flick. It is the first and Original film in the 'X-Men' movies and an awesome film I ever saw. It is my favorite film of the franchise series!!! X-Men was the first movie I saw it back than in 2001 in the summer on the tape, I rent it a VHS video in the video store. That time I did not like the movie because I did not got it and I did read a lot of critics about this movie, that it was bad etc... That suits weren't like were in the comic books. So for Spider-Man they tried to make his suits more by comic books. My favorite and best one is X-Men (2000) the original film. It is a good conclusion to end of the first movie. I love the fight scenes in Liberty Island,that took place in Statue of Liberty in New York. 2.mutants in Canada Wolverine and Rouge are traveling together but Magneto order to attack them, he need it one of them, to used her/him to lunch an attack on the humans. Because he believes the war is coming. Yes Wolverine and Sabretooth does fight each other in this movie, but in X-Men Origins: Wolverine they were both brothers and they don't know who they are, In this one is a hug error put hole I. I like Toad when he spit a powerful toxic goo in Jean Phoenix's face. X-Men is a great superhero comic book movie but it isn't an origin story of how they met each other. The origin story would be X-Men: First Class here is more in the middle class. My favorite movie of the trilogy is X-Men (2000) I considering as best one and I enjoyed this movie a lot. I love it and I love all three of them. Actor Ian Mckellen is great, he played Magneto once again in X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014). X-men is a very good comic book to film story. It has a lot of solid 'superhero-esque' mutants that band together under the hospices of Mr Xavier (Stewart) and with lead protagonist (Jackman) in Wolverine...a lot of ass kicking and taking names going on here. I actually like this series pretty well. Mutants vs Humans vs Bad Mutants...a lot of treachery and twists here and overall, a solid picture for young and old alike. I think this is a good superhero movie, with a lot of fights, and twist, I just love this film to death! Bryan Singer did an excellent job Directing the most awesome Action superhero film! I love this film much better than X-Men: Days of Future past! I love this film, I love Wolverine, Magneto, Phoenix, Rogue, Storm, Cylops and Mystique. The actors portraying the mutants and battle were great. CGI and special effects were also great, they weren't annoying, they were great. 'Mutation. It is the key to our evolution.' The basic plot about this film is In the near future, 'mutants' are the next link in the chain of evolution. Each are born with a genetic mutation that manifests into extraordinary powers. Under the tutelage of Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the world's most powerful telepath, these 'gifted' students have learned to control and direct their respective powers for the greater good of mankind. But when the Professor's former colleague and friend, Erik Lehnsherr a.k.a. Magneto (Ian McKellen) wages war against them and society, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called 'X-Men' to protect the world that fears them.I love this film and it is one of my favorite comic book superhero films! I love it so much! The best film in the series at least for me!X-Men is a 2000 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, distributed by 20th Century Fox.

Spider-Man 3," Awesome End to an Epic Trilogy
","I am fan of Spider - Man since my whole childhood, i been watching series of the cartoons. The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn't give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi's trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb's movie is, Webb's movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, 'Spider - Man 3', Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, 'Spider - Man 3'? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi's trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn't for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi's trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don't have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10",10,123,181,6 December 2012
Resident Evil: Extinction," Not as a good as the first two movies, but still a solid good third entry.
","Honestly I was a little disappointed with this flick how it turned out to be! Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocalypse are my all time favorite films that I love to death, but Extinction is not my favorite Resident Evil film but I still can watch it, I love this film is not as good as the first two films were that were more scary and more darker, this film isn't! It is more an apocalyptic action film in the desert why is the film in a desert when it is all extinction? Is this a game anymore? Directed by Russell Mulcahy and written by Paul W. S. Anderson. Russell Mulcahy directed Highlander 1 and 2 my all time favorite films and he directed a lot of movies. So now Russell Mulcahy want's to make this film Road Warrior meets the zombie film okay cool idea.Plot: Survivors of the Raccoon City catastrophe travel across the Nevada desert, hoping to make it to Alaska. Alice (Milla Jovovich) joins the caravan and their fight against the evil Umbrella Corp.I still think the first two films are superior movies than this one the third one, I do have a lot of problems, again this movie is just not scaryenough to me and I don't think it is a horror movie at all. It is more a sci-fi action movie, it is still better than Afterlife and Retribution that both of the films were a let down. Milla Jovovich is back to kill more zombies in the third chapter of the hit Resident Evil franchise! An action/horror film filled with huge special effects and edge-of-your-seat terror! Then again...I got addicted to this movie and the fantastic Mila Jovovich who seems to be perfect for this role. Don't get me wrong, as a female, I actually like Ali Larter more (she plays a role in this movie too) but I think that Mila Jovovich is perfect for this role. The makers of this trilogy tried to cash in on three separate movies and I actually don't like this. Each party ended somehow with an 'unfinished business' and I don't like open endings too much. From an action point of view, this movie is a first rate action blockbuster. But I still think Apocalypse perfectly ended the story and we didn't need the third movie or more. They should have stop by this one, after this movie the franchise went down hill.Milla Jovovich is superhuman now so there's no real threat to her. Ali Larter does OK despite being Sarah Connor-esque. Oded Fehr does good also, but lacks much screen time. I like Linden Ashby in this movie he did a decent job acting his character, Ali Larter from Final Destination 1 and 2 is in this movie and she is very sexy and very hot. Oded Fehr and Mike Epps from the second movie both come back for the third ride but they both die in this film I do have that problem!Another problem with the film I have is we see the same opening scene from the first movie just this time Alice is killed, I don't like a copy of that scene looking like Alice is dead in this movie! This movie has a lot of problems that I really don't like, but there are things that I do like: Russell Mulcahy has a good eye for visuals and it shows with how crisp the film looks. It is visually stunning at points and the editing is actually coherent. The zombie action and gore is amped up even more so and it delivers. The zombie bird sequence is actually a nice little spin on zombie attacks and it is the highlight of the movie despite some terrible CGI. Milla Jovovich is still the ass kicking Alice so nothing much else here aside from the usual fetishizing her being in towels. Oded Fehr's role gets cut short, but he's still good as Carlos. Ali Larter was OK, but she reminded me too much of Sarah Connor to take her seriously.Even tough with all those problems this film is not that bad, is definitely not a bad movie, Alice saved survivors that Carlos and L.J. were driving together she saved them from zombie birds that they were attacking them.Alice drives a motorcycle and she kicks ass the scavengers trying to kill and eat her awesome! Overall: 8 out of 10 this film has a lot of problems the first two are still MILES way better than this one, but I will still take this movie over Afterlife and awful horrible Retribution!

The Terminator," Schwarzenegger's my personal favorite best action classic masterpiece of all time
","The Terminator (1984) is a masterpiece, the best sci-fi action classics horror movie that started all the Terminator movies. This is Schwarzenegger's best movie and my personal favorite action film. I love this film to death it is my childhood film I grew up with it. Arnold Schwarzenegger was The Terminator T-800 Model 101 indestructible killing machine cyborg. This movie is brilliant, it has brilliant story, brilliant plot, excellent additional cast, brilliant director and writers, good special effects, it is mixed with sci-fi, action and horror. This movie deals with the war that was set in the future but the battle will be fought in the present. It deals with paradox travel trough time.'It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead! 'This is the perfect action film of all time and still even today over 30 years it is a cult classic. The plot and the script provides excellent dialogues. Why it is brilliant? Imagine someone did something in the future and didn't know about it and becomes a primal target for extermination from a killer cyborg from the future now in the present. That is brilliant and excellent idea and story.Two naked men appear in different locations in los Angeles trough flash blue light and electricity they were both set in time from the year 2029 to the present year 1984. One is a human the other is an indestructible cyborg reprogramed to find and kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) the woman whose unborn son will become humanity's only hope in the future war against the machines. The other men is a human being a soldier from the future who has to find Sarah Connor and protect her at all cost. That's the basically plot for this film.James Cameron writes and directs this film with his than wife Gale Anne Hurd who also produced this film and they both does that brilliantly. The script with the story provides a perfect action entertainment trough whole film.Brad Fiedel does a wonderful music theme for The Terminator character and action sequences, car chases and does a drama in which Sarah and Kyle have sex together in the motel room. That's how John was later in the sequel born. Great music score for the film. I love the soundtracks from this film: Photoplay 
 and Burnin' in the Third Degree by Tryanglz.Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the top of his career. This movie bring his career at top of the action stars. Arnold is excellent and he performs excellent and acts brilliant as The Terminator. At one time his agent pursued Schwarzenegger to play the action hero, but Schwarzenegger wasn't interested to be an action hero he was interested to be The Terminator and he played brilliantly well and believable enough. Before Sarah Connor was a tough bad-ass gun guerilla squad in the sequels, here she was a scared victim. A beautiful young woman who was a waitress at the diner and was just a human being leaving a teenage normal life in Los Angeles. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor no else can replace her. She is beautiful and smart and it is my favorite Linda Hamilton movie. She acts very realistic, brilliant and perfectly as the scared victim. Linda Hamilton is the best of the film.Michael Biehn is the only Sgt. Kyle Reese no one else is or can replace him. He is excellent and brilliant I still prefer Corporal Dwayne Hicks but Kyle Reese is my favorite character from Michael Biehn he is a perfect action hero. I love Kyle Reese because he doesn't kill any human being. Lance Henriksen from Aliens and Hard Target is in here and he plays Detective Hal Vukovich and he is very good and realistic as the detective.Paul Winfield is Lieutenant Ed Traxler first he doesn't believe Kyle Reese story but later he witness it him self. I wish there wouldn't be deleted scene in which Kyle and Sarah finds Traxler dying and he gives Kyle a gun. This movie has ton's of action: You see a lot of automatic weapons, shotguns and handguns used in this film and they are used well. You have a car chase between The Terminator and Kyle Reese with Sarah and both men are shooting at each other. Terminator has a stolen Police car and Kyle fires his shotgun and hits twice the Terminator once in the eye. The Terminator than crashes with the car in the wall. In the next scene you see Terminator's eye bloody. You have a great car chase by the end of the film Terminator with truck tries to kill Sarah but Kyle put's a pipe bomb in the truck and you see a huge explosion the truck explodes great special effect. Terminator shoot's with an IMI Uzi in Tech Noir night club. Killing bunch of people in which Kyle stops him with a shotgun. Terminator crash with the car in the police station and kills almost 19 cops.When we see The Terminator been all burned out without flesh with only been endoskeleton covered with steel with his red eyes glowing that is scary when he chases Sarah is scary when I was 6 years old I screamed when I saw that skeleton cyborg attacking Kyle and Sarah. The Terminator is a 1984 American science-fiction action film directed by James Cameron.10/10 Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval The Terminator is a masterpiece a science fiction action horror film, a film I love to death and it is my personal favorite Schwarzenegger film. This is Schwarzenegger's best film with Predator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day I highly recommend those three films.",10,121,146,5 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Flawed, very entertaining solid third sequel an epic conclusion to the original trilogy!
","Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi (1983) is a third sequel in the original Star Wars trilogy it is flawed, yet very entertaining solid third sequel and an epic conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. Honestly in my opinion Return of the Jedi is far way better film than The Force Awakens, that movie was a disaster and it sucked, I rather watch this movie any time. It is not my favorite film in the series and I don't love this movie that much like I love the first two movies, but I like it and it think it is very good at some points. The film has a lot of problems, that hurts the movie. I still have enjoyed this movie and I had a lot of fun. Return of the Jedi (1983) is directed this time from Richard Marquand a different director than it was directed from Irvin Kershner and George Lucas. This movie was released on the same year that I was born in 1983. The film is pretty good on it is own way, but on the other thing it suffers from problems and flaws.Things I like in this movie: The first hour is set back on planet Tatooine which is a rescue mission which I like, the story is set where the first movie begins and ends here.Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO, and R2-D2 return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (who was encased in carbonite at the end of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) from the gangster Jabba the Hutt (voice: Larry Ward).A battle on ship, with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba's men. During the battle, Leia strangles Jabba to death with the chain around her neck and with R2-D2's help escapes from her bonds. The heroes destroy the ship, kills the bad guys and save Han solo. I love the explosion, the rescue and than they are all save.I love that we find out from ghost of Obi-Wan 'Ben' Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that Leia (Carrie Fisher) is the sister of Luke ( Mark Hamill). I love that Luke revels to Leia that she is his sister.I like the battle on the Endor, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Ewoks are battling Stormtroopers to destroying the shield generator for the second Death Star and they do the destroy it. Lando and his assault team destroys the deaths tar on the end.Luke face Darth Vader and the evil Emperor and fights both of them, while they where both trying to bring him on a dark side of the force to join them.I love when Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side, Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle, slicing off Vader's right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut, and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son's blade.Realizing that Luke cannot be turned, the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him, Vader repents and turns on the Emperor, throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death.Luke try's to save Anakin but he dies before he could save him.I feel that Luke's transition from a teenager to calm and collected warrior of the Force feels very authentic. His conflict between Darth Vader and the Emperor contains some of the best scenes in the entire saga.Things I don't like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it: This movie's biggest flaw is the pacing, the Ewoks and their role in the film. Star Wars been in a forest, aren't Star Wars suppose to set in the Galaxy and not in the forest? Personally I don't mind the Ewoks, but their introduction causes the movie comes to a screeching halt. Another fault of this movie is its attempts at humor. It feels often unnatural and forced a lot of the time. The Phantom Menace has been notorious for having this problem as well, but they most likely originated here.Master Yoda dies in this film! Why? Watching Yoda in the prequels I have really enjoyed him much more than I have watching him in the last two movies. Little guy grove up in to my heart. So I disagree about him dying.I am giving this movie an 8, I watch A New Hope and Retun of the Jedi on TV as a kid I don't remember watching The Empire Strikes Back, but I have saw those tow movies and still I like Return of the Jedi a lot.",8,106,129,28 April 2016
Fast & Furious 6," Fast & Furious 6 is The best film in the franchise that I love to Death!
","Fast & Furious 6 (2013) is the best of the best Action film in the series franchise! It's Justin Lin's Masterpiece and I love it to death. Sorry but is not Fast Five and Furious 7 the best, but is Fast & Furious 6 the best one in the franchise! This my favorite best film of the franchise that I just love to death! The film has great cast and great action, great dialogue! It is the last time that Paul Walker starts in this film. In Furious 7 was his brother who was portraying Brian O'Conner with a fake CGI. In here Paul Walker is real, Justin Lin started a great franchise which ended in this film.Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson reunite for this sixth installment in the 'Fast and Furious' action thriller franchise, directed by Justin Lin. After their lucrative Rio heist, and unable to return home, Dom (Vin Diesel) and the rest of his compatriots are forced to kill time lying low in different locations around the world. When DSS agent Hobbs offers Dom and his crew full pardons in return for taking down Owen Shaw (Luke Evans)'s gang of mercenary drivers, the offer seems too good to pass. But as the rivals head for a showdown on the streets of London, Dom learns that Shaw's second-in-command is none other than his presumed dead former lover, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez).I love This film to death! This film is about rescuing Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and stopping a brilliant mastermind terrorist hijacker Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and his team of hijackers.Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez lead a cast of returning all-stars as the global blockbuster franchise built on speed delivers the biggest adrenaline rush yet in this explosive Action Film. Hobbs (Johnson) has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled drivers, whose mastermind (Luke Evans) is aided by the love Dom (Diesel) thought was dead, Letty (Rodriguez). The only way to stop the criminal mercenaries from stealing a top secret weapon is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks for the help of Dom and his elite team. Payment for the ultimate chase? Full pardons for all of them and a chance to make their families whole again.The 'Fast & Furious' franchise has always been a personal favorite of mine. Sure, as a whole, they're fairly easy to pass off as mindless action films for film goers who want a good rush of big-budget Hollywood action, but I've mostly seen them as more of a chugging train of car movies that simply get better with each new installment, and that's no exception with 'Fast & Furious 6,' which I'd probably say is the best addition to the series so far. I don't think I've been this thoroughly entertained by an action sequel in a while. The car chases and stunts are bigger, wilder, and more over-the-top than ever before, the characters' previously limited personalities continue to grow quite impressively, and the story manages to be both awesomely ridiculous and surprisingly engaging from start to finish (even though we all know which side is gonna come out victorious in the end). The action is glorious while it lasts, but then the film goes back to figuring out how to keep its over sized vessel from taking on water. And that's more hard work than it's worth.Still, the best thing about this flick is the character interaction, even with actors whose roles are this limited. Letty's amnesia adds an interesting soapy twist to the plot that forces Dom to constantly try to remind her why she loves him. Brian's fatherhood also lets Paul Walker do a bit of enjoyably self-serious acting of his own. Otherwise, Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges are left with the snappy comedic relief, while Gina Carano, Gal Gadot, and Elas Pataky merely get to look feisty and hot in their action scenes (but at least they do a great job at it). As for Dwayne Johnson, he gives an unusually deadpan performance this time around, with only just a few outrageous outbursts of manly banter here and there. Nonetheless, the cast here is consistently entertaining, with the screenplay letting everyone get a chance to shine, even if some of them aren't quite as memorable as others. The script delivered an action moments with high explosions on an airplane that are not forgettable. I love that fight between Gina Carano & Michelle Rodriguez which it was tremendous. I love this film to death! I love this film to death, Fast & Furious 6 is the best! The battles on airplane are Epic! I consider it as Justin Lin's Masterpiece.",10,99,113,17 October 2015
The Expendables," Old school Action Movie the best one from the beginning till end!
","The Expendables (2010) is old school American Action film and one of my favorite action movies beside with The Expendables 2! This is the best one of the three for me and my favorite movie from Stallone! I love it very much. I wish Mickey Rourke would come back into it sequels. I really enjoyed. All action stars that we grew up from the 80's and 90's came back in to old school that's what I love the most on here and it is awesome action adventure thriller. I love Stallone, Li and Statham also I love Mickey Rourke. OK, if you are going to see this for the story thinking something Oscar caliber for storytelling and writing, then you're seeing the wrong movie. If you want some incredible action by the best in the business and plenty of action hero fan service with a heaping helping of explicit violence, then The Expendables is for you. What can I say about this action packed film with all my favorite old school action stars? I love Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts, Steve Austin,Gary Daniels, Terry Crews and specially Mickey Rourke for his best performance on the screen I have seen. I love the action, the action sequences and the plot in this film. For underrated movie is one of the best action film from old school! In my humble opinion Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Randy Couture and Terry Crews did a terrific job playing the good guys a team of mercenaries on their deadliest mission ever!I love this film and everything that stands for! I am happy that Stallone get all action stars back together. Also Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis had a cameo scene in the film, Schwarzenegger only filmed like 5.mins. than he was unavailable because of his governor schedule. This film is joy able, it is fun, it has great action and the special effects are wonderful. Thank you Sly for making this movie, every action fan appreciates what you did for us. This movie is a treat for any action fan. It is something we have never seen before in the movies.. putting a cast together that consist of Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Willis, Schwarzenegger, Rourke, Roberts, Crews, Couture, Austin and making it work! This movie really is perfect for what it is, if you're expecting Oscar performances and top notch acting then don't bother seeing this, this movie is not for you.. but if you want pure action at its best with some eye dropping scenes especially the ending WOW then this movie will be up there on your list as it is mine. The Plot does work in this movie and there is emotion in this, the acting isn't bad because it is what it is, and it delivers. Sly really does a great job directing and writing movies, he proved himself in Rocky and did the same for Expendables.. there will be a sequel to this greatness and I will be first in line as you should be as well to see it!! do yourself a favor and see this if you haven't already! I love the music score for the film, I love Mickey Rourke even tough he didn't had to do much, he was still nice to seeing him. I loved Stallone's tattoos they were awesome! I love the music score 'The Boys Are Back in Town' by Thin Lizzy I love this song so much! The Music by Brian Tyler was awesome! I am giving this film a 10/10 because it deserves it and I love this film to death! It is my favorite action film alongside with The Expendables 2 (2012) that come 2.years later out! This film has it all, an awesome cast of stars, a good story, and great action! I enjoyed this film very much, and it did feel like a throwback style movie from the 80's. The plot of this story is action packed -- Sylvester Stallone stars as Barney Ross, leader of The Expendables, a tight knit team of skilled combat vets turned mercenaries. Hired by a powerful covert operator, the team jets off to a small South American country to overthrow a ruthless dictator. Once there, they find themselves caught in a deadly web of deceit and betrayal. Using every weapon at their disposal, they set out to save the innocent and punish the guilty in this blistering action-packed thriller.The Expendables is a 2010 American ensemble action film written by David Callaham and Sylvester Stallone, and directed by Stallone, who also starred in the lead role.

Blade II," An imaginative awesome the best stylish action film ever made!
","Blade II (2002) is the vampire superhero action horror sequel film to the original film Blade (1998). We have a kick ass sequel to an R rated kick ass first movie you go the mix of Daryl Dixon who still looks the same and a ball headed Hellboy Excellent!!! Blade II is an awesome movie!!!! Not only does it takes 4.years for this movie to come out since the last movie, but we see Wesley Snipes returning as Blade and he Is awesome!! I love this film but I love the first one way more. It is my second favorite in the Blade trilogy series. So in this movie Blade is on a search for a Whistler, who is now a vampire in this movie. He tracks him down, he finds him, than he meets up with this group of vampires called the Bloodpack. They need his help to track down Nomak (Luke Goss. and he has basically an ability to turn vampires in to Repears that can hunt both vampires and humans. So, yea...That's your basic plot. There are a lot of twist from here and now, but it is AWESOME! Because Wesley Snipes knows all those martial arts, they are nice to look at, and since it is 2002 we now got in to the phase, where the fights scenes are awesome and the choreographer says something once heavy handed, you will see bloody violence right away when the character turns in to an CGI model and it is shown trough whole movie, you can really see that, specially old dude drops kicks, kicks Blade right in the face and goes in to an CGI character, you can kind a see that, kind a weak, but does it track down from the movie? Hell to the no! This movie is awesome!!!!! The beginning of the movie, in the first 10 minutes, Blade already kills like 25 people. That's how it is done, just like in the first movie! He killed like 50 or 60 people from the very beginning of the movie it is AWESOME!!! Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) is a bad ass! He is amazing bad ass! Norman Reedus like I said before still looks 12.year old boy, he is still Daryl Dixon, he still has the same hair style, the same look stubborn on his face and he looks like damn, don't you age boy. And you voice is going now heavy now todays world, but don't you age. Ron Perlman is awesome, he loves to make you hate him, but you can't hate him because he is Ron Perlman, you just laugh at him, because he is such a bad ass and he is such a an awesome, he is so awesome! Where is Hellboy III. Even in Alien: Resurrection (1997) Ron Perlman was standout in that film, come on, the man is just AMAZING! The effects in this movie is pretty good too, besides the fight scenes when they turn the CGI character however, but that's okay I can kind a forget about it because Spider-Man (2002) come out the same year, of course they also did do the same thing, yea, I guess you have to live, with that back than, I'm pretty sure they can do better now this days. Choreograph and everything, Guillermo del Toro takes over, this movie has director, David S. Goyer returns as the writer in this movie. David S. Goyer is a good writer, I have to give him that, he is an awesome writer! How do you make Blade even a more bad ass, than he already was? I think that was possible, it is possible. This movie it is possible and it is awesome! Wesley Snipes has that charm back again, he has that to be a bad ass, but it has that humor aside Blade II, like in the strip club or whatever they were at. Ron Perlman really was about to shoot Blade and Blade had him track down at his gun and he sit like smiling, Wesley Snipes your gold boy your Gold!!! Without the doubt, the acting in this movie is awesome, Effects are awesome, Action is awesome, story is awesome, Cinematography it is kinda even a bad ass, you actually feel bad for one of the characters, tough she was cute, I am just saying. In the end of the day Blade II is one of the best sequel ever, you have to watch this movie!!!!! Guillermo Del Toro is endlessly imaginative when it comes to creating new style, action, and ideas for the vampire mythology. Now the plot doesn't have much character development, but it has just enough interesting twists to keep you interested as well as entertained. And like I said, if you are looking for a movie with brains, this movie should meet your criteria, but if you appreciate brawn, this will blow you away. The sword-wielding warrior Blade (Wesley Snipes - 'Demolition Man,' 'White Men Can't Jump') returns to fight the Reapers, a new race of super vampires hell-bent on annihilating all other vampires before destroying the entire human race. Blade aligns himself with a high-powered team of vampires to defeat an evil greater than either has ever battled.9/10 my second favorite in the Blade trilogy my number one will always be Blade the first one.",10,93,102,30 October 2015
Alien," One of the best classic sci-fi horror films of all time - A masterpiece
","A masterpiece one of the best classic sci-fi horror films from the 70's I have ever saw and experience. The first time I saw this film was in the 97 when I was 13 years old because this film was so popular that time and even today people talk's about it. Watching the first time this film I must say I loved it. I love this film to death of all the sci-fi films today this one is the best one and beats them all. This is the real science fiction film about 'extraterrestrial life form' it is interesting, brilliant about time in the space and life form that want's to whip whole humanity out. This is Ridley Scott's masterpiece and one of his best films of all time. Everything about this film is perfect, the script, the actors, puppetry, models, and special effects about Alien design. I would give this movie an 8 but it deserves a perfect 10 because it has a vision of the most imaginative directors on earth. Dan O'Bannon wrote brilliantly a story and screenplay with help from Ronald Shusett. Both of them make a brilliant imaginative story. This film has no plot holes I don't see them. Helen Horton as the voice of Mother, the Nostromo's computer was believable and realistic and well performed. The design for the parasite (the facehugger) was excellent designed and brilliant. Everyone from the cast in here at acting is spectacular and acts believable. I love all the characters: Parker, Brett, Lambert, Ripley, Ash, Captain Dallas, Kane and even Jonesy the cat. He was really trained I love that cat in this movie. The design about the ship Nostromo is fantastic and so is space and the computers in this film. The eponymous Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger which the effects and designs were excellent spectacular created in the film. Jerry Goldsmith makes an excellent music score for the film that I have enjoy it. My favorite scene in this film is when Parker torchers with flamethrower on Ash's corpse and burns his remains great a special effect. This movie stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto, Bolaji Badejo and Helen Horton they are all believable in their roles.This is my favorite science fiction film tough I prefer Aliens over this film (because it is my favorite film), The Thing, Leviathan even The Blob as a horror films because I enjoy them more but 'Alien' is my favorite science fiction film the best of it's kind. 10/10 doesn't deserve the hate.",10,129,149,20 February 2018
Underworld Awakening," This movie sucks! Not a good Underworld movie like the first three where!
","'SPOILERS' Underworld: Awakening 3D (2012) is a pretty bad film. The first time I watch it, I didn't know what the hell this film was? It was my first Underworld film after seen this I just didn't want to watch previous Installments. It took me 2.years taking a courage and watching first rise of the lycans than underworld and finally underworld Evolution. And I have enjoyed all three of them. Watching this again was terrible! This film was boring. I was bored out of my mind for the first 88.mins. Suddenly out of Blue Kate is killing humans and been ice cold trough whole film, she kills anyone who stands in her away. Michael is gone in this film no Scott Speedman in here. On the end they reveled that girl Eve (India Eisley) is Selene and Michael's daughter. Dr. Jacob Lane a human is a super lycan now. This movie was is a disaster , at best, mediocre, this was a cash grab, for sure. I didn't care what happens to the characters in here. I wasn't interested at all. For 88.mins I was bored and I was keep watching on the watch when the film will be over. The editing was a joke. The action wasn't good, it was awful. You can see the montage what happened in the first two previous movies. So the Humans now are killing the Vampires and lycans. Where did this world come too? They ruined and corrupt Selene and Ruined everything that first three films combined together. Don't get me wrong: I love all three films, they are very good. This film is terrible and bad, yes bad!! The action is not that great I really don't know what happened? When human forces discover the existence of the Vampire and Lycan clans, a war to eradicate both species commences. The vampire warrior Selene leads the battle against humankind.Underworld: Awakening (previously known as Underworld: New Dawn) is a 2012 American 3D action horror film directed by Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein. It is the fourth installment in the Underworld film series, with Kate Beckinsale reprising her role as Selene.I don't want to watch this film again. 2/10 Grade: E- Studio: Screen Gems, Lakeshore Entertainment Starring: Kate Beckinsale, Stephen Rea, Michael Ealy, Theo James, India Eisley, Charles Dance Director: Måns Mårlind , Björn Stein Producers: Tom Rosenberg, Gary Lucchesi, Len Wiseman, Richard Wright Screenplay: Len Wiseman, John Hlavin, J.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The best Marvel comic book superhero movie of 2014 so far!
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) is the best Marvel comic book Action Superhero movie and one of my favorite films of The Avengers! Big, busy and action-packed - like the first movie, but with better pacing. It is a huge improvement over Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) I am sorry but I don't think Joe Johnston is making a good films. He even screwed up my favorite film Jurassic Park III. Great movie! I didn't like the first Captain America but I LOVE this one. Great acting, great story, great action, great EVERYTHING. Marvel Studios continues to improve upon and expand this superhero universe and it shows with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The action is turned up, the performances are top notch, plus with the addition of Robert Redford raises the bar yet again. Chris Evans certainly owns this role know just as Downey owns Tony Stark. I LOVE LOVE LOVED the Iron Man trilogy. There are lots of great intrigue moments, though I think some of the biggest 'plot points' on this one were spoiled thanks to the marketing and broader fan base knowledge of the whole 'Winter Soldier' subplot in the comics. Regardless, it was a fun ride, albeit predictable as far as the internal politics end goes. The themes in this one are far more 'mature' for a comic book movie, too--it almost felt more like a political action thriller à la Jack Ryan rather than a comic book based film, which made me love it even more. Phenomenal cast (the returns were fantastic as always, but the new characters also really did great work!), great music, the action sequences in this are SO awesome and generally I left this movie feeling very satisfied. I'm definitely going to see this more than once. It also makes me want to watch Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., which I haven't actually seen yet, but apparently there were plenty of references!Overall, this was a huge improvement on the first Captain America movie, which I actually didn't liked that much but it was a good movie. I'd venture to say I liked it more than The Avengers. D: Chris Evens gave us a wonderful performance as Captain America, it was the most Action comic book film I have ever seen! This film has a heart, it is Entertained, fast paced, filled with full of actions. Samuel L. Jackson did a wonderful job as Nick Fury, finally his character did something to do in this film, like fighting with assassins and so on. I loved him in this film much better than I did in Avengers : Age of Ultron (2015)in this film he has everything in it. Scarlet Johansson did a good job a supporting cast as Natasha Romanoff she wasn't annoying in here, she was a good supporter to cap. I hated her in Iron Man 2 and Avengers: Age of Ultron, but in this film I like her and I have enjoyed watching her in this film screen. This is the most wildest, most colorful team of superheroes ever brought to life on the big screen, is a massive success, a fan favorite and a critical darling. Winter Soldier, a tense, dramatic conspiracy thriller that somehow makes its strangest comic book elements work wonders, is a masterfully conceived and executed sequel that takes Captain America -- and, along with Guardians, the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe -- in a bold, exciting direction. Both are outstanding films. Both boast astonishing confidence, production design, action and visual effects. Both are terrific fun. Both represent a brave new world for comic book movies. And each one for completely different reasons. Which is Marvel's crowning achievement? How do you even compare the two? Answer: you don't. Other than ranking the films by personal preference, it's a fool's errand to pit Cap, Black Widow and Falcon against Star Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot. You sit back, think to yourself it's good to be a geek, soak it all in, and wait for the inevitable Avengers crossover. Love 'em both. Watch both of 'em over and over and over again. Enjoy each one on its own terms. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) was probably my second favorite Marvel film of 2014 but this one Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a kick ass best film ever! This film kick's Joss Whedon's Failure Avengers Age of Ultron in to the ground! This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth.As Steve Rogers struggles to embrace his role in the modern world, he teams up with another super soldier, the Black Widow, to battle a new threat from history: an assassin known as the Winter Soldier. I love this movie and I don't care what anyone say! It Is my favorite best Marvel film of 2014!Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a 2014 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger and the ninth installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Marvel Studios Starring: Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smulders, Frank Grillo, Emily VanCamp, Hayley Atwell, Robert Redford, Samuel L.

Over the Top," My all time favorite Stallone's classic action film!
","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take an action classic sports drama, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Over the Top (1987) I really do believe is an action classic sports drama! This is a great film for what it is and it is 'Over the Top'! This is a movie I always was a big fan of it. I am a just big fan of the film. I used to watch this film over TV when it was on and I used to had a copy on VHS tape, I don't have it anymore, but I will get it on Blu-ray. This movie is directed by one and only Menahem Golan and it was written by Stirling Silliphant and Sylvester Stallone him self. Right after Rocky IV, Rambo: First Blood Part II and Cobra was followed by Over the Top about an arm wrestler father who try to reconnect him self with his son. I Loved this movie as a child and I love it since now! I think Stirling Silliphant did a great job writing a screenplay for this movie, he actually first wrote for Don Johnson - Miami Vice star, when he was so popular in that TV show in the 80's. Stirling Silliphant's presence and screenplay did help a lot of this movie! I know A lot of people will disagree with me and put my review down but I prefer this movie over Rocky V and Real Steel! Someone wrote on IMDb on Rocky V 'A wonderful movie about father and son', that would be Over the Top! If you look Rocky V closely, you will probably see, similar story from Over the Top! I know a lot of people are making fun of this movie saying is just ridicules, it is a drama about a father trying to reconnect with his son, it also has an arm wrestling. And I am what makes this movie and the plot more ridicules than Real Steel?, which is a film that got praised and got thumbs up by critics, I would really like to know, because that movie has the same plot and it is even more ridicules. It is about a father trying to reconnect with his son, but it also has robots boxing, boxing robots! That's more ridicules than arm wrestling! Really?, seriously? Real Steel has 60% Rotten Tomatoes, but this was slammed from critics and only got 36% and get's a lover ratings over Real Steel on both sides. And Real steel is a film that basically rips off this movie, does a bad job of it, it's 10 time ridicules than this. It is nearly as much fun and the father is an asshole who was whiling to sole his son. Really? He was whiling to sole his son! In this film Lincoln Hawk (Sylvester Stallone) is not that kind of dad, he would never even remotely thinking of doing that!!! In fact he beats some guys up, who try to takes his so away from him! So why Real Steel get's the praise?, but Over the Top get's the bashing and get's the crap from critics. I really don't understand, but that just me personally. If you like Real Steel more, that's fine I don't have a problem with that. Over the Top is not your film, that's cool, you don't like it, that's cool I just don't understand it. I just don't understand why this film has such a bad reputation, the same goes with Lethal Weapon 3. Why is Lethal Weapon 2 much more better and bad ass than Lethal Weapon 3, 'oh wait Riggs kills 15 people in 2 and in 3 he only kills less than 5 people. To me that is not the case, I think Lethal Weapon 3 is the same good as the 2 is. The odds are always against this movie.'The world meets nobody half way. If you want something? You gotta take it.' Rocky and Rambo star Sylvester Stallone gives fans another reason to stand up and cheer. He stars as hard-luck big-rig trucker Lincoln Hawk and takes us under the glaring Las Vegas lights for all the boisterous action of the World Armwrestling Championship in Over the Top (co-scripted by Stallone). Relying on wits and willpower, Hawk tries to rebuild his life by capturing the first-place prize money - and the love of the son (David Mendenhall) he abandoned years earlier into the keeping of his rich, ruthless father-in-law (Robert Loggia). He matches muscles with some of the game's gargantuan greats - and grips you tightly with a rousing finale in crowd-pleasing Rocky style. Grab hold for rip-roaring fun! Over the Top is a 1987 sport drama film starring Sylvester Stallone. It was produced and directed by Menahem Golan, and its screenplay was written by Stirling Silliphant and Stallone. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Warner Bros.

Full Metal Jacket," 'Born To Kill' - The best Vietnam war movie of all time
","SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to 'weed out all non-hackers'. Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes 'Joker' (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes 'Cowboy' (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes 'Gomer Pyle' (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. 'Joker' Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined 'hours of boredom, seconds of terror' feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. 'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the 'duality of Man' according to Jung. 10/10",10,116,134,14 October 2015
Pacific Rim," Pacific Rim sucks ass - such a disappointment and a let down!
","*SPOILERS* Pacific Rim for me personally sucks! I have been watching yesterday this movie and I was disappointed a lot! This movie was boring, over long, the character were boring, I didn't care for any of the characters! The story makes no sense to me, robots are fighting against Kaiju monsters that were aliens, I had no clue what those aliens wanted from destroying the city's?! This movie was so boring that I had to go to sleep 3 times in the row! I hate this film, the writing was awful, the plot felt half-baked, the acting was crap and it was horrible. I am really disappointed why was I even bother watching this movie. Now it is getting a sequel and I am definitely not going to see the sequel and I don't care for! This movie was directed by Guillermo del Toro and I am not really a fan of this guy, the only 2 movies I have enjoyed from this guy is Mimic (1997) and Blade II (2002)! I have already reviewed that movie, it is definitely my favorite film. I have been watching just recently Mimic and I was surprised how good monster horror film that was and I am going to reviewed. Mimic is Miles way better than this crap film and it is way underrated. I never seen Hellboy movies and I am not planning too either, but those two films Mimic and Blade II are my favorite films from this guy! I just wanted to see Robots vs. Monsters. Instead I get boring characters, story, and 'development. If you like this film, good for you your opinion, my opinion is this film was lazy writing, boring and wooden film with dull not logical story, terrible acting and horrible CGI and dull characters! I hate Charlie Day in this film, I don't like his comedy's in this movie, Pacfic Rim supposed to be a fun popcorn Sci-Fi action film and not a boring comedy! His acting was the worst in the film I have seen, he sucks in here!Films I have enjoyed more than this crap: Battleship (2012), Independence Day (1996), Aliens (1986) and even Battle Los Angeles (2011) are way better alien films, they don't have robots in it but they are at least fun! I had such a terrible experience with this movie and it is such a letdown! The whole movie was about the good guys getting their asses kicked and being all emotional, they never stood a chance against the enemy and they only won because they cheated at the end by self destructing their last robot in the enemy base.The whole plot is so terribly thought out, like, we have this giant powerful sword, but we will not use it till the very end? they mind-meld and supposed to share all the memories and everything and know everything the other person knows but yet he didn't know about the sword? and if they had such technology from the very first start, why didn't they use it? they could have just sliced all those monsters in half and none of the pilots would have died, its just stupid.CGI of Kaiju was awful and terrible, I wasn't convincing about this movie! Idris Elba and Robert Kazinsky died in this movie which is a let down! The rating for this movie is F 1/10 it failed of been a good film, Pacific Rim is a time waster, boring as hell, it is a poor movie, over-hyped lazy ass not much to do movie. I care less about the fighting or the swords in this awful horrible film!",1,1,4,2 October 2016
Rocky II," A good sequel , and an OK movie to the original best film!
","Rocky II (1979) the sequel to the success of the first Rocky (1976) film, is my at least favorite movie. It is a wonderful movie continuing the story a total worth of time. It is an OK movie for me. Here are the reason why is my at least favorite Rocky film: He earns a little money spends all what he earned, he stinks at the commercials, he can't read, he can't get a job, he is not allowed to fight anymore because Adrian is so selfish and doesn't let him. She is not trying to protect him, she is so selfish and she doesn't want him to fight. She is putting him down. Apollo Creed keeps insulting Rocky, Rocky starts working in the gym and he keeps getting humiliated him self twice. Once in the commercials and second in the gym. The first hour is getting boring and slowly goes , the second hour is paced when he starts training the rest sucks. He doesn't train hard over guilt of Adrian than she falls into coma and he doesn't train anymore. I am wondering how he even lasted 15.rounds and won the title if he stopped training. Everything that Apollo cared in this movie was to get a revenge. This movie is not inspiring it is a good sequel but it is just not inspiring. Rocky becomes a janitor in Mick's gym, Apollo keeps insulting Rocky with words like APOLLO CREED vs. THE Italian CHICKEN,' with a cartoon picture of Creed grabbing and choking a Rocky-headed chicken. People from the gym was laughing at Rocky and he just ignored them. Adrian put down Rocky, even Mick put him down. Rocky asked him to train him again and Mick reject and put him down. 'Creed would have caved in the whole side of your face. Now, forget it, kid. You got the heart, but you ain't got the tools no more.' Tool's no more? Rocky has a heart so stop putting him down. Apollo and his guy were keep insulting him with a bum.Mick keeps insulting him, finally against Adrian's will Rocky accept the fight, but he starts training over Adrian's quilt and than he quit training. Adrian fall's in come and he stop training that is stupid! He wanted to gave up Everything for Adrian! Trough whole film there are no boxing matches or any boxing fights, only the rematch between Rocky and Apollo that's it. In all Rocky's there are more boxing matches than one, in this we see only one fight. On the commercials the director keeps insulting Rocky because he can not read. He get's fired from his job as a meat packer. I am sorry people but Rocky II is my at least favorite sport drama film. Too much drama in it, slow pacing and field with boredom.Things I do like in the film: I love the training and fight sequences. I love the music score by Bill Conti - 'Overture', the music that Bill Conti wrote was perfect and they fit to the film. I love the opening scene when, the story picks up where the first movie left off. Rocky goes to a hospital after his fight with Apollo and Apollo demands a rematch. I love the hospital scene, I really love how Rocky is praising Apollo and him, saying they both did great. The last fight between Rocky and Apollo was filed with heart. Stallone did not insult Carl Weathers character but he made both of the characters an equal opponents and Apollo lost for one second the title. The fight for the world champion ship was awesome. I love how Rocky was struggling and was trying to find a job, I love that. I love one man's real life human's drama portraying on screen. I love how Mick was training him. I love his methods of training. I love that film is set in the 70's and I love Apollo training sequences. I also love how Tony Duke motivated Apollo in the ring. I also love that no one dies in this movie and Rocky wins the title the champion of the whole world on the end of the movie.The are a lot of moments I love in this film and a lot of moments I despise and I don't like in this movie.In the aftermath of his bout with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) attempts to lead a peaceful life with his new bride, Adrian (Talia Shire). The fame and fortune from the match soon runs scarce and to make ends meet, Rocky agrees to a re-match with Apollo.That is the main plot. I think Sylvester Stallone did a wonderful job writing and directing this job. The rating I give to this film is 7/10 because the film was a wonderful follow that told the whole story to end.Rocky II is a 1979 American film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is the sequel to the 1976 film Rocky, and was the last installment in the film series that was distributed solely by United Artists.7/10 Grade: B- Studio: United Artists, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith, Tony Burton Director: Sylvester Stallone Producers: Robert Chartoff, Irwin Winkler Screenplay: Sylvester Stallone Rated: PG Running Time: 1 Hr. 59 Mins.

Southpaw," Amazing sports drama since Rocky, the best!!!!
","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a sports boxing realistic Drama, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off. Since new spin-off Rocky movie Creed (2015) was been released and I am against it for ruing and killing off my Rocky balboa character including all movies I decide to watch a Boxing Sports Drama movies. Southpaw was the first Boxing movie in 2015 I saw since Rocky. I am not a big fan of Jake Gyllenhaal and his movies, recently I just watched Nightcrawler (2014) and I hated that movie since everyone is praising it. But I did like Donnie Darko (2001), Jarhead (2005), Zodiac (2007) and Prisoners (2013). This movie surprised the hell out of me. What I mean with that, this movie was portrayed In realistic Boxing drama since Rocky about an human man's life. At times, you feel like you're watching a documentary on a real man's life. It's that much realistic. I had no idea that actors portrayed and acted so good, that it feel realistic to me. I am sorry if you don't agree with me, but I think this movie is miles away better than Creed. I love drama movies portraying a human's life a man's, boy's, girl's or woman's it doesn't matter as long the acting is good. In here the acting and portraying a human Boxing sports Drama is good and convincing. This movie isn't masterpiece but it is so much good. I am also not a big fan of Antoine Fuqua movies but Southpaw become my favorite realistic Boxing drama movies alongside Rocky, Million Dollar Baby and Rocky Balboa. My favorite movies of Antoine are: The Replacement Killers (1998) and Training Day (2001), those two movies are good. Denzel Washington is my favorite actor. The actors everyone does a great job. Especially Forest Whitaker as coach Tick Wills, he was awesome and did a believable acting, I have ever seen. I still remember him from Bloodsport (1988) as Agent Rawlins. The man still can act and he made of 100 movies. Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing as always but so were Forrest Whitaker, Rachel McAdams, and the actress Oona Laurence who played the daughter. It had a great story focusing on dealing with grief, anger, and maturity as well as controlling your destiny and not letting your emotions overtake you. the fight scenes were well done as well. It was a little cliché but hey if it ain't broke don't fix it. The film focus more on one man's struggling trough hard time in life. A World Light Heavyweight boxing champion loses everything after his wife was accidentally murdered. He loses his property, his self respect, respect from his fans, he loses his next fight, loses all money and the court takes him his daughter away and gives her to a social service, he may lose her forever. The man who was guilty for his wife's death walks free smiling and wins the title. This movie is about a hardest fight in the man's life. He has to fight against all odds. He need to get his daughter back and he needs to train and get's self respect including avenging his wife's death. The training sequence are awesome and I have never saw any training sequences in any movie not even the technique Billy was using in a movie like that. I only saw one technique different used in Rocky IV movie. Billy Hope seemingly has it all with an impressive career, a beautiful and loving wife (Rachel McAdams), an adorable daughter (Oona Laurence) and a lavish lifestyle. When tragedy strikes and his lifelong manager and friend (Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson) leaves him behind, Hope hits rock bottom and turns to an unlikely savior at a run-down local gym: Tick Willis (Academy Award winner Forest Whitaker), a retired fighter and trainer to the city's toughest amateur boxers. With his future riding on Tick's guidance and tenacity, Billy enters the hardest battle of his life as he struggles with redemption and to win back the trust of those he loves.That is the main basic plot and it is not all about boxing and fight, but it is about struggling life and his only living family member, his own daughter. I love this movie and gets a perfect 10 for me. Southpaw is an excellent boxing Sports Drama film from beginning to end. Give it a chance. Southpaw is a 2015 sports drama film directed by Antoine Fuqua, written by Kurt Sutter, and starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Forest Whitaker, and Rachel McAdams. The film was released on July 24, 2015, by The Weinstein Company.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: The Weinstein Company Starring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Forest Whitaker, Naomie Harris, 50 Cent, Oona Laurence, Rachel McAdams Director: Antoine Fuqua Producers: Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal, Steve Tisch, Peter Riche, Alan Riche, Antoine Fuqua, Jerry Ye Writer: Kurt Sutter Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hrs. 4 Mins.

Ant-Man," One of my all time favorite MARVEL superheros movies
","Ant-Man (2015) is my all time favorite MARVEL film it is my fourth favorite MARVEL film the first three are Captain America trilogy that I love to death while this movie stays right behind them. It is a fun and entertaining film and I have really enjoyed it, I don't have any problem with the film and I never really read the comic about Ant-Man, but watching this movie it is really solid super-hero movie. Ant-Man is MILES way better than Deadpool (2016) who get's so much praise for it! It is MILES way better than Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Wolverine, X-Men: Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse and Hulk (2003) those movies really sucked. Ant-Man (2015) is better than those movies that is just my opinion you even have a solid cast. I love that Ant-Man doesn't kill people and when they blow up the building no one is hurt, that makes him a superhero. I am a big fan of Michael Douglas and he does an excellent job as Hank Pym he was excellent. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man was incredible. I mostly remember him from Friends when he played Mike, Phoebe's boyfriend and he make the movie with Jennifer Aniston also from Friends) The Object of My Affection (1998) he was terrific in Ant-Man. Evangeline Lilly from Lost and Real Steel is incredible excellent as Hope Pym who is Hank's daughter. Corey Stoll as Darren Cross / Yellowjacket was good at in his acting performance as the villain and last and at least Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon was wonderful to see him in this movie I loved it.Plot: Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, cat burglar Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, plan and pull off a heist that will save the world. I love the film because it has a heart and it has a redemption, everyone deserves a second chance. It also has a strong message bonding estrange father and daughter together. Scott Lang is a former systems engineer at VistaCorp and petty criminal who acquires a suit that allows him to shrink in size but increase in strength. The movie is an origin story of the petty crook Scott Lang who comes into contact with a suit and does his best to make good, and then look at someone like Paul Rudd, who can do slightly unsavory things like break into people's houses and still be charming and who you root for and whose redemption you will find satisfaction in. He becomes Ant-Man and he is doing the right things for his daughter. He's ex wife throws him out while her new boyfriend is a cop pursuing Lang, he has one chance to make this right to be in his daughter's life. REDEMPTION.I have enjoy the visuals effects and the CGI was pretty good creating Ant-Man I didn't mind it. Checked Ant Man out again very fun entertaining comic book movie that didn't use the alien invasion angle, falling buildings or the world is gonna end, just a simple story, great visual effects and likable characters. The Ant-Man/Falcon fight was bad ass and I loved how Ant-Man defeated him. He saved his daughter Cassie and he showed that he is a good father. In the comics he used pills instead of discs to enlarge and shrink things. I think that was a good change they made. A final battle scene in the daughters bedroom on her Thomas Tank engine train track, imaginative an original and fun. Marvel's latest may not be their greatest achievement but yet another gamble for a character that is less then popular in that Universe. Adding the legendary Michael Douglas to the cast was pure genius much as Robert Redford played along in The Winter Soldier. The overall movie is fun and the execution of performances are fine but Ant-Man doesn't quite have the punch that I was expecting nor rank in the top five of all the Marvel films thus far. However the character should have a few solo efforts in the pipeline not to mention he's be seen in Civil War and most likely the next two Avenger Infinity War movies.The rating I give to this film is 10/10 it is my favorite MARVEL film I own it on Blu-ray disc and I enjoy it watching it, it is a pretty damn solid good movie at least for me. Ant-Man is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics characters of the same name: Scott Lang and Hank Pym. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the twelfth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Peyton Reed, with a screenplay by Edgar Wright & Joe Cornish and Adam McKay & Paul Rudd, and stars Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll, Bobby Cannavale, Michael Peña, Tip 'T.I.'

Captain America: The First Avenger," My favorite underrated superhero action reboot film!
","Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) is a pretty decent film by its own way. It is one of my favorite superhero comic book films. I love this movie to death. Everyone knows that Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of my favorite best comic book action film. But this one is close and right behind The Incredible Hulk. I love this movie and it has a great comic book reboot origin story of how Steve Rogers become a superhero Captain America. The first time I have saw this movie, I did not like it, I even made wrote a hateful review about this movie, It took me three times in the row watching this movie till, have I enjoy it and than loved it. But I still think Captain America: The Winter Soldier is far superior movie flick over this and way better, tough that doesn't mean Captain America: The First Avenger is awful, it is not every fan should have known that! This film is miles way better than The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron both of the movies. I choose this movie over Avengers movies! I have Age of Ultron and I hate Avengers because they are running stand up alone movies.In this movie Captain America went on his own mission to save his friend and the rest captured man and he saves them all on the end, without any support. He uses his shield to fight the Germans I really love that. In my opinion it was a great comic book origin adaptation that went back to basic, where it all started it. I LOVE the fact about this movie to the explaining in what the main character Captain America became Captain America, not just a documentary, there is a huge difference! He is actually one of my favorite superheroes. Chris Evans becomes America's ultimate weapon against evil in the fun-filled superhero adventure 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. In the 1940s, headstrong Steve Rogers (Evans) volunteers for a top secret government experiment that transforms him from a scrawny weakling into the Super Soldier known as Captain America. Captain America leads the fight for freedom against the evil HYDRA organization and their leader Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who has discover an otherworldly power that will ensure him world domination.Captain America: The First Avenger is the latest comic book adaptation to hit the big screen, and is certainly a playful action-packed flick. Though not a comic book masterpiece, it does succeed in capturing the spirit of what a comic book movie should be. Director Joe Johnston has created a stylish old-fashioned adventure picture with some solid elements of drama, humor and action. The cast also includes Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Toby Jones and Stanley Tucci. The Red Skull is a great villain. He has every ounce of the evil that was in Hitler, and he has the advanced weaponry and sacred power that Hitler actually sought out. And not to mention, he's a super soldier like Captain America. He's basically Hitler x5, that's the perfect recipe for a villain. Tough the movie did feel a little too rushed, like it was leading up to the Avengers. It's not the absolute best movie Marvel Studios has put out, but it's definitely up there.This movie has a few plot holes and a few movie mistakes, but which movie doesn't have? I think this movie is pretty good on his own way before the Avengers come out. I am glad there was more explained in The Avengers and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The character development is great and the action is cool with a compelling story. The film is kind a lacking in action, it has action but is more build on Steve Rogers-Captain America character and Red Skull character. Captain America: The First Avenger is the 2011 feature film adaptation of the Marvel comic book series. Directed by Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer), the film stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, a young man from Brooklyn who during the Second World War, desires to join the US war effort, but is rejected due to his undersized stature. When he volunteers to be part of a secret US program, Rogers then finds himself genetically transformed into the world's first super soldier. The film is also part of 'Phase One' of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that includes Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, and Thor and culminated in 2012's The Avengers. In addition to the 2012 film, Chris Evans returned as Captain America in the standalone sequels Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War, and Hayley Atwell would return as Peggy Carter in both a Marvel One-Shot and a 2015 ABC television series. I am giving this movie an 8, it deserves a fair rating.8/10 Grade: A- Studio: Marvel Studios Starring: Chris Evans, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Stanley Tucci Directors: Joe Johnston Producer: Kevin Feige Screenplay: Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely Based on Captain America by Joe Simon Jack Kirby Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 04 Mins.

The Godfather: Part II," A classic Epic Masterpiece it's one of the most best sequels of all time
","The Godfather Part II (1974) is one of the best sequel's out there! Following the story right from the first film! I love this film as much a is love the first one. Drawing on strong performances by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of Mario Puzo's Mafia saga set new standards for sequels that have yet to be matched or broken.Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The Godfather, parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption.The Godfather Part II presents two parallel story lines. One involves Mafia chief Michael Corleone in 1958/1959 after the events of the first movie; the other is a series of flashbacks following his father, Vito Corleone from 1917 to 1925, from his youth in Sicily (1901) to the founding of the Corleone family in New York. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone did do a strong lead and a wonderful perfect job he acted in this film superb and strong. Robert De Niro as young Vito Corleone did a brilliant performance I have ever saw. He played an Italian immigrate superb and brilliant, there isn't any connection that he is American at all, his ascent is gone. It is like he was born an Italian by birth.I love this film Because you get both sides of the story, because you're able to see where De Niro's coming from, just seeing those guys in the movie. Again, I think there's something that, when a sequel can hit it right, to keep pushing, instead of, 'Let's capitalize on what we did the first time.' And for me, maybe one the first movies where I felt like, 'Ooh, we're getting a backstory.' That, to me, was really thrilling. And just to see those guys, that young and hungry. That's it, that is the right thing there. Coppola is at the top of his form in both films.Simply as a story, the Michael scenes in 'The Godfather: Part II' engage our emotions. I admire the way Coppola and his co-writer Mario Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he handles delicate decisions involving Hyman Roth (Strasberg), the boss of Miami; Fredo (Cazale), his older brother, and the shooting of Sonny (James Caan). Who has done what? Why? Michael floats various narratives past various principals, misleading them all, or nearly. It's like a game of blindfolded chess; he has to envision the moves without seeing them.But finally it is all about Michael. Even the attack on the night of his son's first communion party is on his bedroom, not our bedroom. His wife, Kay (Keaton), leaves him, and his focus does not waver: He will keep his son. Tom Hagen (Duvall), the most trusted confidant of father and son, considered a brother, is finally even suspected. In Michael's life, paranoia is a useful defense mechanism.Coppola shows Michael breaking down under the pressure. We remember that he was once a proud war hero, a successful college student, building a legitimate lifestyle. But on their wedding day, Kay first began to fully realize what an all-controlling cocoon the Corleone clan was. There would always be things she could not be told about, could not be trusted with. Finally Michael has no one to tell or trust except his elderly mother (Morgana King). Michael's desperation in that intense conversation explains everything about the film's final shot.The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on his crime syndicate stretching from Lake Tahoe, Nevada to pre-revolution 1958 Cuba The Godfather Part II is a 1974 American epic crime film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola from a screenplay co-written with Mario Puzo, starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Partially based on Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather, the film is both sequel and prequel to The Godfather, presenting parallel crime dramas.The most memorable best epic Francis Ford Coppola's classic masterpiece sequel ever, the film stunned everything for brilliance to superb acting. I love this film to death, I love it!!!!!

The Bourne Ultimatum," The movie that I don't like and it is the weak uninteresting Bourne movie i saw!
","*SPOILERS* Oh boy The Bourne Ultimatum the third movie in the Jason Bourne film series, it is the movie that I have never liked and honestly the weakest dumb movie I have saw. I think this movie is over hyped over praised on IMDb 8,1 and it is way over rated movie that it is not good. Honestly I don't care about Jason Bourne in this movie and about the lead character anymore.The action sequences are terrible for me, I don't buy the action in this movie. Wow car crashes in New York or something. This is the movie I never liked, I never understood and I always forget what this movie is about! Is about nothing and I don't care.What is so decent about this movie tell me?: Bourne realizes that the CIA is following Ross and helps him evade capture for a while, but when Ross panics and ignores Bourne's instructions, Blackbriar assassin Paz (Édgar Ramírez) shoots him dead, in the middle of a busy station, on orders of Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Matt doesn't shows any emotions in this movie when Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) is killed. Like I try to save him, but I couldn't or that he would promise that he would get justice for an innocent person but no! He only showed to me how selfish he was in here.Paz (Édgar Ramírez) killed Ross and Bourne let him go in the car crash he didn't killed him! Why did Bourne let him go? Paz killed an innocent human been a person, he was evil character and Bourne let him live an assassin! So that he could kill again and again!! How dare you movie?, how dare you movie to let a bad guy live?! As Bourne flees to the roof, he is confronted by Paz, who asks, 'Why didn't you take the shot?' Bourne repeats the dying words of The Professor in The Bourne Identity: 'Look at us. Look at what they make you give.' Paz lowers his gun, but Vosen appears and shoots at Bourne as he jumps into the East River. How the heck did Bourne survive in this movie when he was shot in the back and he jump in the river?! Only two actresses I like in this movie: Julia Stiles and her character are still alive, she helps Bourne and Bourne saves her by hiding her from CIA agents for termination. He saves her from Paz by defeating him in a fist fight with his martial arts.Joan Allen her acting performance was incredible and it was a movie that it was a worth of watch but I never understood or liked this sequel I can't. I love the first two movie but I don't like this one at all.Those are the only two things to watch those two girls I liked about this movie, that it is worth of time watching.NOTE: I am still going to watch this movie as a time waster to complete trilogy, it is MILES way better than The Bourne Legacy and Jason Bourne the last two movies that come out! I don't care about the full disclosure of Jason Bourne or that his real name is David Webb just like I don't care about Jason Bourne the fifth movie that come out this year that sucks ass! This movie is way better than The Bourne Legacy and Jason Bourne but is not a great movie it is not the best one at least not in my honest opinion.He let the bad guys go, they won in this movie. I don't like it The Bourne legacy is worse movie than this I have issues with those three movies that come out. It is a step down from the first two movies that come out.The ending is unexplained and not logical how Bourne is alive, what happened to Agency and the operation Blackbriar? What happened on the end? It is not logical and confusing.I think this movie should have been the last Bourne movie, there was not needed by making any more sequels. The only good thing about the movie I can say is it is not boring or over long like The Bourne Legacy is. This franchise to me is dead I only can enjoy the first two movies but that is all. I will try to make exception for this movie and change my opinion. But every time I am watching this movie I liked it less! The rating for me is F 1/10 I don't hate the movie or the fans but I don't think it is a good movie mostly the lead character is not a decent bad-ass but a selfish prick in this movie for 2 hrs.",1,2,5,9 December 2016
Predator," A masterpiece - the best action sci-fi classic film of all time my number 1 personal favorite
","SPOILER: Predator (1987) is a masterpiece - the greatest bad-ass best Sci-Fi action film of all time. I love this Sci-Fi action flick to death! Predator is Epic Sci-fi Action movie of the 80's, my number 1 personal favorite best action sci-fi classic film of all time. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and the rest of his team are all the time in the jungle hunted by an alien Predator, that's what makes this film and story more interesting than. This is very fast paced action flick, you never get bored or you fall a sleep. My favorite best Action Sci-Fi Flick movie was always Predator and It always will be. Is my number 1 Schwarzenegger best Action Sci-Fi Epic movie. The best action movie ever made! Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer is my comic book hero this is my hero. The hunted becomes the hunter on the end of the film when he camouflage with mud to defend him self against the Predator-ultimate hunter and hunts him down by setting booby-traps for him the best! 'If it bleeds, we can kill it.' In the remote jungle of a Central American country, an elite group of commandos led by Major Dutch Schaeffer, embarks on a CIA mission to clear out a guerrilla stronghold and rescue the remaining hostages. However, the hunters become the hunted when a highly intelligent, otherworldly being slowly and methodically starts killing off members of Dutch's team. Possessing a chameleon like camouflaging ability and a deadly alien arsenal, the creature tracks down the soldiers one by one.This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with an $98 million budget (in 1987!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used.This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Richard Chaves, Elipidia Carillo, Shane Black, Sonny Landham and Kevin Peter Hall they are all believable in their roles and even add to the humor that this movie has. This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today. And let's all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall, who died a year after he had made Predator 2.Predator is the 1980's most adrenaline-pumping, action-packed, violent mainstream film of the decade, a film replete with nearly non-stop action, loud, messy violence, huge muscles, big guns, and an extraterrestrial killing machine with infrared sight and a laser cannon on his shoulder thrown in for good measure. The film's budget was around $15 million. 20th Century Fox released it in the United States on June 12, 1987, where it grossed $59,735,548. Initial critical reaction was mixed; criticism focused on the thin plot.Predator is a 1987 American science-fiction action directed by John McTiernan.10/10 My all time favorite action film I love it to death it is my personal favorite action film of all time. Predator is a masterpiece, one of the best Sci-Fi action films of al time. I own the DVD and I also own the Blu-ray disc. I used to had ultimate hunter edition on Blu-ray but the subtitles were awful and the picture was lousy and wax like plastic. I sold it to someone that need it and I bought the original early release version on Blu-ray instead.",10,136,158,1 January 2018
The Bourne Identity," The original and the best Bourne action thriller!
","In my opinion, the Bourne Identity is the best out of the entire trilogy. Jason Bourne is really cute in this movie and he's less 'angry' or in his 'I need to kill anyone who follows me' mode. I love this movie to death it is my second favorite Bourne film in the trilogy. The first one will be The Bourne Supremacy. The movie is the second adaptation of the Robert Ludlum novel of the same name (the first being a 1988 television film starring Richard Chamberlain as Bourne). This is a mystery spy thriller, that you keep guessing what happened with Jason and it is so intense. Matt Damon does a powerful performance and incredible job as Jason Bourne. This movie is packed with curiosity, romance and of course action! It is not boring or over long and most the time it feels like the film is more realistic. This is the real Jason Bourne and not the character Matt Damon was portraying today in the fifth installment Jason Bourne (2016)! I hate that movie but I love this one! Plot. A man is picked up by a fishing boat, bullet-riddled and suffering from amnesia, before racing to elude assassins and regain his memory. I did hear about this movie in 2002 or 2003 I always wanted to watch this movie after reading an article in the magazine about this film. 10. years ago when I was in high school I watched this movie on TV and I loved it I turn on my computer and I went to see if there is any sequel and yes it was The Bourne Supremacy and at the time our network did not give the sequel on TV it took me 3 years till I download and watched the whole trilogy. And I love the first two movies to death and I love the character Jason Bourne he is decent. We find out more about Treadstone that, is assassin squad a top-secret black ops program of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). I absolutely love this film to death! Director Doug Liman did amazing job producing and directing this movie and he knew exactly what he has to do to make it right and it worked. Clive Owen as The Professor the CIA hit-man was a fantastic assassin and the villain I loved him.I love the chemistry between Jason and Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), I love the fight scene between Jason and CIA assassin Castel (Nicky Naudé) in Paris. I love how Jason becomes a fugitive and he doesn't kill trough entire film anyone except the bad guys on the end of the movie. I love the showdown scene with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) using a 12 Gauge Double Barreled Shotgun belonging to Eamon (Tim Duttin) to search for the Professor, after the Professor tracks him and Marie to the farmhouse in the French countryside. Bourne shoots the Professor twice with Eamon's shotgun, mortally wounding him, I love that scene to death. In this movie Julia Styles has a lot to do! In mostly sequels she was useless, but in this movie she was brilliant and the star off the movie! She was helping Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper) CIA, really hunting Bourne, she was powerful joy able and intelligent field logistics coordinator and agent handler. I love her to death in here!Brian Cox as Ward Abbott as Head of Operations was incredible villain and he was the mastermind behind Treadstone operations. Chris Cooper is fantastic as Conklin Field Director of the Treadstone he is the fantastic villain. Franka Potente is sexy and really gorgeous likable. I love her ascent because she is really German like her character Marie is.I never read a book or the novel and I have never hear about the movies or the character before but watching this movie I fall in love with it. This movie become the hit in summer 2002. Who would have thought that Good Will Hunting himself could pull off a kick-ass balls to the walls secret agent character that would essentially change the way we see action movies for the 21st century. Matt Damon does that very thing. The Bourne Identity is filled with old school action and stunts that makes this film dare I say better then Bond ever was. Of course that changed when Casino Royale came out, however it was Jason Bourne that started the new look. Overall: This movie is brilliant and intelligent, I love this film to death! It is my second favorite film in the series, love the car chase scenes with Bourne and Marie siting in it. I have fun watching the movie and I will always watch it over and over again. It is my favorite spy mystery action film. Watch this one a few times, and you'll likely be quite moved each time. I'll be surprised if you give it less than what I gave it: 10/10 The Bourne Identity is a 2002 American-German action thriller film. It is an adaptation of Robert Ludlum's novel of the same name. It stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a man suffering from extreme memory loss and attempting to discover his true identity amid st a clandestine conspiracy within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The film also features Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Julia Stiles, Brian Cox and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. This, the first in the Jason Bourne film series.10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Brian Cox, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Gabriel Mann, Julia Stiles, Josh Hamilton Director: Doug Liman Producers: Doug Liman, Patrick Crowley Richard N.

The Matrix Revolutions," An amazing third entry to end the Matrix Trilogy!
","The Matrix Revolutions (2003) is very underrated trilogy of the mythology to understand. I know for a lot of people is not that good and it is terrible movie to watch. The first time I watch it, I couldn't finish it because I did not understand it and I felt bored with the movie. The second time I kept watching I just enjoyed the movie and I wanted to know more, what will happen next. I think the movie end perfectly the trilogy, tough it did lack on a story and on the action, there very barely in it, that it was in the original and the second movie. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies amd I love this movie to death I don't care what anyone says. The movie it self's focus more on the humans and the battles against the machines on the planet Zion, more than they are in the phone line of Matrix. I think this was a brilliant end to a brilliant trilogy. If you didn't understand what the matrix was by the end of the film, then you're never going to get it! Many viewers preferred Revolutions to Reloaded, thinking it was a simpler, more straight-ahead action movie. Though it may have appeared that way, nothing could be further from the truth. Revolutions was a mind-blowing layered ending that honored and respected the plot threads and themes introduced in the first two movies. The character arcs were satisfying and true to the characters introduced in The Matrix. The creators continued to challenge our understanding of the Matrix and its purpose, avoiding the temptation to serve us a bunch of 'their' answers on a platter. That, to us, would have been a sellout of the vision they've been constructing, and wouldn't have been fair to us. Nor would it have been true to the spirit of the previous movies - they've never told us what things meant, they've only shown us the door. Everything that has a beginning has an end. In this explosive final chapter of the Matrix trilogy, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity battle to defend Zion, the last real-world city, against the onslaught of the machines that have enslaved the human race. And, now as Neo learns more about his heroic powers--including the ability to see the codes of things and the people, he faces the consequences of the choice made in The Matrix Reloaded. For Neo, that means going where no human has dared - into the heart of Machine City and into a cataclysmic showdown with the exponentially more powerful renegade program Smith. The revolution is now: The Matrix Revolutions.I wish they made more films about the Matrix. The fighting, story and the conspiracy theories that emerged from these movies created a new world for millions of people out there. Some of the conspiracy theories even created a new 'religion', the CGI was at the time freaking impressive, the fighting in slow-mo were even more epic and the story itself captured a lot of hearts. Just saying to all who think this movie (and/or the first two) sucked balls,- you are a minority. Movie is great, second one being the best in the trilogy. It is my second favorite film in the trilogy because it ends the story and answers what happened with Neo (Keanu Reeves), he saved Whole planet and defeat Smith (Hugo Weaving) on the end of the movie. This movie may not be the best in storyline, but hell it knows how to make action! That end fight and emotional ending leaving behind a plot for sequel ...Second really expanded the meaning of matrix and the whole idea so I don't understand the hate.There is a lot of memorable moments the Smith vs Neo climax rain scene is one of my favorite movies scenes of all time. Anyway I love this movie it is not good as the greatest or the best movie or that good, but it is still a worthy sequel to watch and a good end to the trilogy. It is one of my personal Keanue Reeves favorite movies and I love this movie to death. I am giving this 9/10 and only because one of the characters dies in this movie not telling which one.",9,117,142,15 November 2015
Man of Steel," Man of the Destruction, Zack Snyder destroyed superman!
","Man of Steel (2013) is an necessary time waster reboot! I hate this movie I hate Zack Snyder and I hate his movies the only movie that I like is Watchmen (2009) I absolutely love that movie, but I hate the origin story of Superman that is all wrong. Man of Steel sucks! Their is plenty of action in here and fights what action and fights? I don't care about it fans! This superhero film has no heart and soul in here at all. Superman in this film does not give us a hope, justice, and freedom! I hate this film! We have now a Superman who kills people, he twists necks, he killed Zod by twisting his neck and letting Zod killing innocent people! Superman is stealing cloths now, wow. Christopher Reeve would never ever do that. Christopher Reeve is the only Superman and Clark Kent and not Henry Cavill! The reason why man of Steel is so popular today is because he is modern, so teens love it. I don't! I grew up watching Christopher Reeve as Superman in Superman I, II, III and IV.This isn't Man of Steel a Superman movie it is a Man of the Destruction! Thanks a lot DC and Zack Snyder for making such a horrible film about my favorite super hero! Superman only saves Lois Lane and a soldier and that is it? Over 1000 people dies in this film and Superman doesn't saves them.Pa Kent tells Clark that he shouldn't save the kids from the drowning school bus? He should let them die?! What is wrong with you Kevin Costner why would you say that? Superman insults his father pa Kent and he lets him die in a tornado storm and he doesn't do nothing trough that scene, except winning about it how his dad is dead now! What is wrong with you Clark!? I hate the alien invasion in here and I hate seeing Superman not saving people. Wow he saved some co workers on that oil rig, but he steals cloths from people! My honest opinion is this is the worst origin reboot Superman movie ever and it is not a Superman movie at all! Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is even far worse and it is my humble opinion the worst Superman movie! The acting in this movie is terrible. This is way to overrated and over-hyped.Hans Zimmer theme music for the movie was alright, but again was hell no to John Williams theme on Supermen, Hans Zimmer theme hides from John Williams. Though I did like the song, that is the only thing I did like it.I hate the alien invasion and Superman does not give any hope here at all.Christopher Reeve is the only Superman who saves everyone, Henry Cavill kills everyone except Louis Lane why fan boys want believe me is so wrong! Superman in this movie doesn't do anything for me except killing people! Christopher Reeve is the only superhero not Zack Snyder and Henry Cavill! This movie is horrible and made Superman into a selfish asshole from outer space. This movie is Superman's Kryptonite. A textbook example on how not to make a superman film. The product placement was distracting, the collateral damage at the end was appalling, the exposition was insulting to my intelligence, the action was lame and the movie sucked a giant super dick.This movie has a cartoony CGI, there's not that much action except turning Smallville into a war zone, breaking one machine that destroyed all of Metropolis, and a fight with Zod with a LOT of collateral damage. Not much of Superman saving people, way too long/slow/boring, shaky cam up the wazoo, random flashbacks, over the top villain, way too much Exposition Dialogue of just Explaining stuff, and bottom line No Heart and No Fun.I would definitely rather watch Smallville TV show I love that TV Show to death Clark always saved people in there, in the first season when tornado swept Lana, he run and he saved her, he didn't let her die.Also Louis Lane finds out about Clark Kent's secret in here and in the original Richard Donner's Superman movie she didn't find out about Clark's secret at all.I do like Amy Adams she is a good actress she also started in Smallville in one episode in Season 1 which I loved it.This movie is terrible, just terrible I hate the CGI, the character development, the actors in it, the alien invasion gosh. I already saw alien invasion in Roland Emmerich's Independence Day (1996), why would I want it in this reboot here? This movie gets rating for me F 1/10.Superman (1978), Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut (2006), Superman II (1980), Superman III (1983), Smallville (2001 - 2011) TV Series and even Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) and Superman Returns (2006), in my opinion, all of them are MILES way better movies than this Overrated Trash.",8,4,10,15 August 2016
The Thing," 'The Thing' is John Carpenter's masterpiece and one of the best classic horror films!
","A classic film. John Carpenter's 'The Thing' is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made - fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I'll put any of 'The Thing's' old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see 'The Thing' again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend? Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy/gal next to you really real?'Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.' John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!! 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",10,206,226,31 October 2015
The Hills Have Eyes," A decent awesome horror slasher remake that is better than the Original!
","The Hills Have Eyes (2006) is a decent horror slasher remake flick from Wes Craven's classic film from the 70's. Don't get me wrong by my title when I said is better than the original, I like Wes Craven's classic horror film from the 70's, but Wes Craven ruined it, with a rushed unnecessary sequel. Watching this flick I must say I love this flick to death, much better than the original. It is my personal best horror remake of them all, the best one that Hollywood come up with it, this is just my opinion. It is more bloody, more entertaining and it has for more action than Wes Craven's original flick did. I love this flick and it is definitely in my favorite horror slasher films. The fact is: this film is well shot, well directed by Alexander Aja, has a good intensity to it, wonderful score by Tomandandy, a solid job by Aaron Stanford aka Doug (for me the acting of the leads, like Doug, in this version was way better than the original), and the ending was extremely thrilling. Great comeuppance of the mutants by Aaron Stanford. His fight against the mutants to save his baby was intense, brutal, bad ass, and was a hell of a fight. He deserved his victory. This film is a fast action packed horror flick that put's you on the edge of your seat. I recommend this film to any horror film fan, but it is not for everyone.Plot: A cross-country road trip takes a deadly turn in this chilling remake of Wes Craven's classic horror film about a stranded family that falls prey to a freakish clan of blood-thirsty mutants in the New Mexico desert. Packed with gut-wrenching gore and heart-stopping suspense, The Hills Have Eyes will keep you on the edge of your seat! I like the original, but it ends without any explanation, this movie does far way better, I like the changes Doug Bukowski (Aaron Stanford) was such a bad ass in this movie, far way better than the character was in the original. Pluto (Michael Bailey Smith) was a creepy horror slasher mutant in this film, unlike he was in the original. I like the music score by Tomandandy François-Eudes Chanfrault, which it was far way better score than in the original film was. Aaron Stanford for me in this film is a real bad ass no question debut. I also liked the actress in this film Emilie de Ravin who plays sister-in-law of Doug Bukowski, her acting was amazing, she was gorgeous and weary beautiful I love her to death. Mostly I remember her as Claire Littleton from Lost (2004).I know this film isn't a cult classics or potential classic, but for a horror flick, it is far way far better than the original and this film took my breath away. Dan Byrd also did a solid job as Brenda's brother Bobby Carter. You have also Ted Levine from Joy Ride, Tom Bower from Die Hard 2 (1990), Billy Drago from Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection (1990) who plays another villain in this film and Robert Joy from CSI: NY (2005) as his beloved character Dr. Sid Hammerback. The cast is still great in this film and it have a solid cast. You have an explosion in this film, a lot of action, a lot of fights, the villains are really scary and not goofy like they were in the original.I like the scene when Doug then awakes in an icebox where the mutants keep the bodies of their victims and he bangs on the box until it opens, I love all bloody scenes and I love that Brenda, Bobby and of course Doug with his baby Catherine stays the family on the end of the film.Good horror films STICK WITH YOU. 'The Hills Have Eyes' (2006) is such a film -- a masterpiece of horror. I saw it in on my computer 3 years ago and I never forgot it. It's bloody, grotesque, and very disturbing -- which, of course, make it a great film -- a film to be remembered (and heck, it's only a re-make)! The performances and the story are believable and shocking -- and really, that's what I want in a horror flick: I want realism -- otherwise, what's so scary? They spared nothing.Overral: I love this flick to death, It is my favorite horror flick and the best one in the remakes. It get's a solid 10 by me.The Hills Have Eyes is a 2006 American horror film and remake of Wes Craven's 1977 film The Hills Have Eyes.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The best action sequel of all time and one of the best Schwarzenegger's movies my personal favorite
","Terminator 2: Judgment Day is (1991) is the best action sci-fi flick movie from the 90's ever made of all time. Terminator 2 is my personal favorite film I absolutely love this movie to death! Is my number 1 best movie ever till today the best of the best epic movie of all time. T2 was nominated for 4.Oscars the only movie of the franchise was nominated for an Oscar. If you watch T2 carefully and follow the story you never got bored and you are very entertained. This movie kicks ass! I love the hospital scenes mostly at night, the Cyberdyne building action sequences and of course steel mill action sequences are perfect for this film. This film deals with a lot of action, sci-fi and does involves a lot of paradox past travel. There is a lot of explosions and automatic weapons used in the movie and they are used well thousands of bullets are fired and explosive projectiles are fired at the police cars. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the good terminator T-800 did an awesome Terrific real job, he acted believably as one of his best characters I ever saw on screen. Terminator walks to the front of the building and kicks a desk out a window. Than ignores the police's order to surrender and fires a M134 Minigun with Chainsaw grip at the police cars below, avoiding the humans. The helicopter pilot moves away. Terminator than uses a M79 grenade launcher to destroy two more vehicles. Its heads-up display indicates no human casualties. The film has a heart and is the best film in the world. Robert Patrick as T-1000 is 'a mimetic Polly-alloy' or 'liquid metal.' He can shape shift to match other people he touches, after first arriving in present time, he decides to have his base form be that of a nearby cop he killed and passes himself off as a cop in that form. The truck chase scene is awesome and the crash is also awesome. The truck that hit in to another column in the canal and explodes, T-1000 emerges as a shiny, featureless, liquid metal figure. Its features become more pronounced and its colors return to normal, returning to the form of the unharmed pseudo-cop is awesome. It shows what his character can do. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor she acted her character perfectly here she played her character genius and very convincing and real, tough beyond all belief and completely focused on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety. Sarah Connor is her best performance ever in the both Terminator films. Little out of her mind with paranoia and anger: amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to). Edward Furlong, is the only John Connor for me, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom told him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well. Earl Boen plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden Dr. Silberman from the first film The Terminator (1984) that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and Robert Patrick did there best acting performances, those actors who played there characters are beloved till this days and Terminator 2 has since been ranked as one of the greatest action, science fiction sequel films of all time. Twin sister of Linda Hamilton also appeared as Leslie Hamilton Gearren as Twin Sarah in dream she was for real there wasn't no CGI in here. Twin brothers Don Stanton and Dan Stanton both of actors appeared in here one as Lewis the Guard the other as Lewis as T-1000 who kills lewis they were for real no CGI, except special effects for T-1000 knife. Terminator special effects were designed by Stan Winston R.I.P. who has done incredible job making those effects. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments. T2 is James Cameron masterpiece. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. James Cameron writes, produces and directs brilliantly this film. Brad Fiedel does a perfect music score to the film. American rock band Guns N' Roses wrote a single for this movie 'You Could Be Mine' and Schwarzenegger appeared in the music video as T-800 in the music video for this movie. The chopper scene that crashed in to a SWAT van and explodes was awesome. The CGI and special effects are awesome. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task actors, stunts, puppetry, models and special effects designed from Stan Winston. It is Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, and for language, it is a perfect film from the 90's that I have grew up with it. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",10,164,194,6 January 2018
Disturbia," a guilty pleasure of mine my all time favorite mystery thriller
","I admit this is guilty pleasure of mine, Disturbia is my all time favorite Shia LaBeouf film. Probably his only best movie he did before he went and stared in The Transformers trilogy. I love this movie to death, I got this movie this Thursday on Blu-ray disc that I have I bought and I watch it next day and I had a really fun. I really love this movie and it is a good mystery thriller movie. Sadly it is not a horror movie and it is rated PG-13 movie not R to bad. So sadly it is not scary enough but it is thrilled and it is suspense with fast paced. Do I think it is the best film or the greatest one? Of course not but is not a bad movie it is an entertaining mystery film that keeps you guessing what will happen next. This movie is partly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. I know also there were 2 movies in the 90's that also come out: Rear Window (1998) with Christopher Reeve and of course The Darklings (1999) with Suzanne Somers I watched that movie in 2003 and Rear Window with Christopher Reeve I have seen long time ago after he did. I am big fan of Christopher Reeve and I really miss him. I will re watch that movie again, but I can't find The Darklings (1999) anywhere on the net.*Even on this quiet three-lined street, no one is safe...especially from the savage killer next door. Welcome to Disturbia, a cool thriller with big scares.' Living under three months house arrest, Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf, Transformers)passes his days spying on the neighbors. It's all fun and games until things take a horrifying turn for the worse. Kale is convinced his neighbor next door is a serial killer- but he can't prove anything, can't convince anyone and can't leave his house without triggering an alarm. Enlisting the help oh his good friends. Kale is determined to expose the truth - but have they all taken on more than they bargained for with a cold blooded murderer on the loose? With nowhere to run and nowhere to hide, Kale and his friends are in a race for their lives in this electrifying thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Shia LaBeouf turns in a terrific pulse pending performance, the cast also includes David Morse, Sarah Roemer and Carrie-Anne Moss in this film. I love the cast in this movie beside Shia LaBeouf, here is Carrie-Anne Moss the hot sexy babe from The Matrix who play's Kale's mom awesome. Sarah Roemer as Ashley (Kale's neighbor) is one hot sexy hot chick and really awesome. David Morse is terrific as the villain serial killer. I love everything about this movie the story about a high school student who loses his dad in a car accident and he attacks his Spanish teacher and he get's 3 month house arrest. When he starts spy's on his neighbors out of boredom he finds a shocking truth about his neighbor Robert Turner (David Morse) that he is am actual serial killer. This movie has also a good soundtracks like are: Louque - Whoa now and Taper Jean Girl by Kings of Leon I like these two soundtracks they are good. I love the chemistry between Kale and Ashley and I just love this movie to death! On the end of the film was really creepy when Kale found skeletons of the body's. I have enjoy this movie it is really a guilty pleasure of mine I only wish it would be a horror movie that is why I didn't give a 10 but I give this movie B+ 7/10 it is really a good movie I recommended it. Disturbia is a 2007 American horror thriller film directed by D. J. Caruso, written by Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth and stars Shia LaBeouf, David Morse, Sarah Roemer and Carrie-Anne Moss. The film follows a teenager who is placed on house arrest and begins to spy on his neighbors, thinking one of them is a serial killer.7/10 Grade: B+ Studio: Paramount Pictures Starring: Shia LaBeouf, David Morse, Sarah Roemer, Carrie-Anne Moss Director: D.

Rocky IV," The best classic sport action film from the 80's!
","Rocky IV (1985) is definitely one of the best Sport action films of the 80's! It is my number one favorite best movie in the Rocky series! I love this movie to death and I don't care what anyone says. It was my first film I saw it as a kid, it is my childhood film and I grew up with this movie! Sylvester Stallone did gave us one of his the most best performances of the Rocky character ever! This film along side with Rocky III is very underrated, misunderstood, bashed and dissed off from fans and it's critics! I love this film to death and it has a special place in my heart. The film has everything that I love in a Rocky film. It is fast paced and Entertained from beginning till end.The film goes very fast, is not boring, dull or lame, it is actually pretty good film, is not bad is actually good. The fourth installment of the Rocky series isn't the greatest film like, were his predecessors but it is still a good film. People: It's not that bad. In fact, it's really good. Okay, it isn't a classic like the first two movies were, and it suffers further by comparison to 'Rambo: First Blood Part II' which came out six months before it. But 'Part IV,' was still one of the best movies of its year (1985). That fight at the end was EPIC, just amazing. As for the music, Bill Conti is great but so is Vince Dicola! Vince is a genius on synthesizer music. The fight at the end was a literal clash of the titans level bout, and his music fit it so perfectly! Rocky IV remained the highest grossing sports movie for 24 years before it was overtaken by The Blind Side. It is the fourth and most financially successful entry in the Rocky film series.As a kid Rocky IV was always my favorite best movie. It still is alongside with Rocky I,III and Balboa! It is sad that Apollo dies in this movie I hated that, but the rest was pretty fast entertaining, well faced paced entertained action movie. This is the first movie that place actually took in a different country and not in the US. I love when Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) fly's to Russia to fight the best undefeated champion Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). The training sequences were awesome the fight sequences were entertained and very paced amazing. The soundtracks for this movie were pretty awesome and great. James Brown Living in America was awesome. The fight between Rocky and Drago was set on 25th December Christmas. This is the first Rocky film where the music is not composed by Bill Conti. The Fourth movie was one of the best Sport action movies Directed by Sylvester Stallone, he made such a great wonderful performance I love You Sly. Without you there wouldn't be Rocky.I have heard a lot about this film: Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed and Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago really did not get along and got into an a real fight during filming. Lundgren threw Weathers across the ring before it was broken up. You can even see the scene during a press conference regarding the match, hostility is created between Apollo and Drago's respective camps. The fight really went out of hand. Carl Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Sylvester Stallone forced and convince those two macho ego actors to comeback and finishing the film. The major problem with this film I have is killing the most best awesome character Apollo Creed. In Rocky sequel almost everyone dies. The killing one of the most favorite characters was one of the worst idea Stallone ever had. In Rocky III Mickey dies, in Rocky IV Apollo dies in Rocky Balboa Adrian Dies. Stallone kept killing our favorite characters but he memorized them. The movie wasn't filmed in Russia which that really disappointed me and I think Stallone should have visit Russia and film at least one scene there. I love sound effects and Rocky IV is one of the few sport movies that applies genuine sound effects from actual punches, bona fide training methods created by boxing consultants, and a bevy of other new special effects. I love everything that it is about this film, everything!'When east meets west, the champion remains standing' Rocky Balboa,heavyweight champion of the world, is the trainer for Apollo Creed in an exhibition match against Ivan Drago, a 'superman' boxer from the Soviet Union. When Apollo is killed in the ring by the brutal Drago, Balboa blames himself and promises to avenge his friend's death in the ring. That is the basic and simply plot of the most awesome sport action film of the 80's! Rocky IV is a 1985 American sports film written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, who also starred in the film. The film co-stars Dolph Lundgren, Burt Young, Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Tony Burton, Brigitte Nielsen, and Michael Pataki. That is the basic plot of the awesome sport action film!The rating I am giving a 10, I love this film to death, I grew up with it and it is my number1 favorite Rocky Film!",10,122,136,4 November 2015
Face_Off," John Woo's most overrated the worst action film and the worst of Nicolas Cage performance ever!
","*SPOILERS* Face/Off (1997) for my self is over long, over blown, over dramatic, over hyped and in my honest opinion is one of John Woo's most overrated films he ever directed! I think Broken Arrow (1996) is much better action movie, I think it has a lot of better action sequences, the pacing is better, the characters are better. John Travolta's acting performance in Broken Arrow is over the top, but it seems more natural in Face/Off! Christian Slater is better than Nicolas Cage. Christian Slater is not the greatest actor in the world, but he is not over acting the point where I am laughing my ass off when I am watching an episode of Looney Tunes! That is how I feel I hate this film and I think it has ridicules plot, ridicules premise and ridicules acting. Especially from Nicolas Cage, his Quotes: 'I'm ready, Ready for the big ride, BABY!' Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!! Diiiiiiiieeeeee!!!!! It is stupid, the lines are ridiculous! The assassination of Sean Archer's 6.year old son the beginning scene is evil and lame. Cage touching a girl 's but in the church and treating women's like a piece of garbage I really hated that. Their first showdown between Travolta and Cage on the airport and Cage is singing it is really ridicules. Cage screaming like a girl I am Castor Troy and Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeee are really hilarious Lol they are all funny ha ha.Like is said as a kid Con Air introduced me in to The Rock and Face/Off my mom bought me those three films on VHS and as a kid i like this film as an adult I don't. Face/Off and Mission: Impossible II introduced me in to John Woo films, before that I didn't know the director.More problems I have with this film: Nicolas Cage kills a 6 year old child with a fake mustache. Nicholas Cage kills a women, John Travolta want's to kill a child it is ridicules. Nicholas Cage is dressed as a priest and he is touching a girl's but in a church, what is wrong with this picture?! Start's well John Travolta is the good guy FBI Agent, while Nicholas Cage is the bad guy, I like the beginning the way it was. Suddenly both of the actors change their roles which I don't like at all! I thought Travolta as the villain was the worst terrorist villain ever! I haven't seen this movie over years on VHS so I bought a Blu-Ray watching this film on Blu-ray for the first time over the years as an adult I was seriously disappointed! I was bored out of my mind from this film! The movie was boring and I didn't see any spectacular action in this film at all! This is Nicolas Cage and John Travolta's worst acting performance ever. Nicholas Cage is on drugs trough entire film and even for been a good/bad guy he is high and he is on drugs. I don't care for any of the characters in this film at all! I am sick of this film I think people love's it only because of action and it is the most overrated American action film that John Woo directed! I think their is a lot of people out there that don't like this film. I think this film is a time waster and a stinker!The only action scene that I did like was the prison break escape when Nicolas Cage jumps of the cliff from prison in to a water. But again this escape makes no logical to me, how did Nicolas Cage saved him self when he jumped in to the see, when he was of shore miles away. I think it would took him days to save him self at all, when he didn't had any boat by him self, I even think he would drowned. I don't see a point liking this film at all, I love Hard Target to death than this overrated trash! Broken Arrow is even way better film than this. John Travolta is way better in Broken Arrow than in here! I enjoy Hard Target way more than this film, Hard Boiled, Broken Arrow, Paycheck and The Killer are one of my favorite John Woo films I rather watch those than Face/ Off! The 'Over the Rainbow' crap is probably the worst gun play in the film ever made. Putting a kid during a shoot outs while playing the song 'Over the Rainbow' crap! I hate that scene because people keep dying in this movie, you see a woman been shoot to death from FBI Agents in a bar I really don't like this film. It's not his magnum opus like critics and fans would have you believe. Hard Target is my all-time favorite Woo film. I do think Broken Arrow is better than Face/Off, and I hated the Siskel & Ebert mind change. That seemed pointless to me, obviously he enjoyed it the first time or he wouldn't have been so adamant about a thumbs up.Con Air (1997), The Rock (1996), National Treasure (2004), National Treasure: Book of Secrets (2007) and Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000) are all Nicolas Cage movies that are miles way better for me than this overrated trash! John Woo films, that are MILES way better than Face/Off and they are all time classic for me: Hard Target (1993), Hard Boiled (1992), Broken Arrow (1996), Paycheck (2003) and The Killer (1989) are MILES way better films. I rather watch those films! And yes, I have enjoyed Paycheck miles ways better, than I did this fake action film, rating for me is F 1/10.",1,8,17,17 September 2016
Spider-Man," My favorite superhero action film of all time
","Spider-Man (2002) it is an epic Sam Raimi Action superhero flick! This first Spider-Man film become my favorite film of superheroes. I remember when this film come out in 2002 and become a huge hit that year. I kept watching and listening video spot Hero - by Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott. I wanted to see so badly that film that I bag my neighbor to get me that film and he did I watch it on Computer the same year that this film come out. And I love this film I love it not as much as I love Spider-Man 2 (2004) and The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) but I still love it. I am glad they made this film in 2002 and Sam Raimi directed this film. I love it and it is my favorite best Spider-Man movie yet. I watch it in 2003 my mom bought me VHS when she was still alive, she isn't anymore it remind on my teenage years in high school. I watch it yesterday and I still can't get bored with it. Green Goblin was the best villain ever in Spider-Man I love him. The Amazing Spider-Man was really awesome I love it so much. I love them all Spider-Man movies.I still find the original enjoyable, but I'm not nearly as forgiving of its flaws as some are. I think Spider-Man 2 was great, but the first one really is... crappy. I get it that it appeals to people by 'capturing that exciting comic book feeling', but that isn't enough for me to say it's a good movie. The new movie has stronger emotion and had more weight to it, and I was RELIEVED that the ending was different. Yeah, it was a selfish thing on the new Peter's part, but I forgive him for it. A marvel movie shouldn't really go to much into the origin unless it relates to the story of the rest of the movie, if the origin is connected to the actual plot, then it's appropriate to show it, if not, then it's something you can get done and over with in the first 10 minutes or so, this movie is a prime example, the goblin wasn't related to the origin, so it went by quickly.I love The Amazing Spider-Man a lot, but my favorite movie will always be Spider-Man 2002 I grow up with that movie. Spider-Man 2002 is much much better for me then The Amazing Spider-Man is. Fans who compare TASM over SM are just kids and maybe they watch TASM before they even hear about SM or who knows why they do that, everyone has their own opinion. I love Spider-Man 2002 equal the way I love The Amazing Spider-Man:P That is my opinion .Average teenager Peter Parker is transformed into an extraordinary super hero after he is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. When his beloved uncle is savagely murdered during a robbery, young Peter vows to use his powers to avenge his death. Deeming himself 'Spider-Man,' he sets about ridding the streets of crime, bringing him into conflict with malevolent super-villain 'Green Goblin.' The action, acting and pacing are excellent and the movie manages to action, romance, drama and comedy all into one great package! Spidey has always been one of my favorites. I was surprised that Raimi was given the role of director with this film, considering his only real claim to fame is the Evil Dead series before this, but his direction here is very well done. The acting is very good. Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Everyone fits into their role well -- great cast. The special-effects are okay. Raimi can't seem to decide what scene should be CGI or which should be wires when it comes to the antics of Spidey saving the day or duking it out with a villain 'Green Goblin'.The musical score was only part of the success for this movie thanks to Danny Elfman. The special effects were mind blowing for me to see Spiderman swing from high buildings to catch the bad guys. This movie is worth every penny and it is worth owning. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson did a wonderful performance of her role. I seriously love the actress, I am a huge fan of her and I always was. She did played the character well, like the role of Mary Jane Watson was written on her skin.'With great power comes great responsibility.' Bottom of line I love this film and the fighting scenes between Spidey and The Green Goblin was awesome. CGI in this film wasn't bad It was great. The whole film was huge Entertainment.Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi. Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, the film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a high school student living in New York, who turns to crime fighting after developing spider-like super powers.

The Amazing Spider-Man," Finally an reboot origin story to Spider-Man which is better than the original!
","The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) A reboot of the original Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies that I think is miles better than the Original was. Here you get the real story. The Amazing Spider-Man was fantastic and delivered everything I hoped it would. I am sorry people but I love this film more than I love Spider-Man (2002) Sam Raimi's Original film. This is my second favorite best film of The Spidey franchise. I don't care what anyone says I think this is the original origin story than Sam Raimi's Original films. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is like Tim Burton's Batman. Marc Web's The Amazing Spider-Man is like Christopher's Nolan Batman Begins (2005). There isn't any difference This film is pretty good is actually better than the original but not better than Spider-Man 2 (2004) is. The Amazing Spider-Man' tells the story of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), an outcast high schooler who was abandoned by his parents as a boy, leaving him to be raised by his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field). When Peter finds a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance, leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), his father's former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering decisions to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero.I love the facts that Spider-Man did not killed anybody in this film. Like Peter saved that guy,falling off the roof. Peter was still in a high school, he was brilliant and a genius and not some emo nerd random dude like he was in Spider-Man. The origins of Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker a reviled. This film has more heart than Sam Raimi's film ever had. I love that Peter did not stalked Gwen like some obsessed person like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man did to Mary Jane. He saved that kid including all the cars falling from the bridge. The CGI was great it wasn't bad. The only problem with the film I have is that Peter confess Gwen his secret that shouldn't happened, but I just realized that was written on comic books. Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone was brilliant and I love her in this flick. I love that Parker saved whole New York from giant Lizard. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man did not do that. This is a real super hero for me. And yes I love this film, it grew on me and It is my favorite super hero film and the film isn't dark at all. Martin Sheen as Ben Parker did a fantastic job as Peter's uncle and Sally Filed as Aunt May Parker was awesome she portrayed the character by the comic book. I love how Peter Parker turn in to a vigilante to an ultimate hero. He has more heart in this film than Tobey Maguire has. Yes I am saying that. I admit it I didn't like the first time this film I saw and I wrote a hateful review 3.years ago, but after I kept watching this film on Blu-ray the film just really grew on me. Andrew Garfield did portrayed perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man and did a wonderful job as Spider-Man ultimately superhero. I've always been a huge Spider-Man fan, so seeing this movie was an absolute must for me. I'll admit, I was also a bit reluctant to see it, since Sam Raimi's trilogy did such an impressive job telling the story of the web-swinging superhero. Nevertheless, I ended up seeing 'The Amazing Spider-Man' on opening day, and I couldn't have been any more pleased with the results. Andrew Garfield was the perfect choice to play Peter Parker, as were Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy and Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors (The Lizard). Garfield and Stone's on-screen chemistry, in particular, blew me away with how genuine and real it felt. As for the action sequences, don't even get me started. The state-of-the-art visual effects, combined with James Horner's epic score, kept me on the edge of my seat almost the entire time. Don't get me wrong, while this film definitely gets a lot of things right, it isn't perfect. The script lacks some of the charisma and soul that the original flicks had. Plus, the dramatic scenes frequently feel darker and more self-serious than they need to be. But in the end, I can't deny the fact that I had an awesome time with 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. It was fun, fast-paced, and full of energy. It may not have reached the same heights as the original Spidey movies, but for what it was, it more than delivered. I definitely recommend this film for any hardcore superhero fan. Personally, I can't wait to see where the franchise goes from here! Peter Parker is going back to high school in The Amazing Spider-Man as a teenager dealing with both contemporary human problems and amazing super-human crises.After Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically altered spider, he gains newfound, spider-like powers and ventures out to solve the mystery of his parent's mysterious death.The Amazing Spider-Man is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man and sharing the title of the character's longest-running comic book of the same name. It is the fourth theatrical Spider-Man film produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Entertainment, and a reboot of Sam Raimi's 2002–07 trilogy preceding it.I love this film and is my favorite best Spider-Man flick alongside with Spider-Man 2 (2004)! 10/10 Score: A+ Studio: Columbia Pictures, Marvel Entertainment, Laura Ziskin Productions Starring Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Sally Field, Michael Sheen, Dennis Leary, Campbell Scott, Rhys Ifans Director: Marc Webb Producers: Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach, Laura Ziskin Screenplay: James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, Steve Kloves Rated: PG-13 Running Time 2 Hrs. 16 Mins.

Aliens," A masterpiece - one of the best epic-action films of all time my personal favorite
","Aliens (1986) is the best Epic Sci-Fi Classic Action Movie of all time and one of my personal favorite best action sci-fi flicks that I love to death. Just like I love The Terminator and T2, I love this movie to death. James Cameron's classic masterpiece. The now classic science fiction film was only the third feature directed by James Cameron (following Piranha Part Two, The Terminator). It is the sequel to the 1979 film Alien and Alien is a masterpiece I love that film, but I love this movie more sorry this is my personal opinion this is my movie. I am not saying it is better than the original movie but it is right up there with Alien a real classic.  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the sole survivor from the original 'Alien', returns to Earth after drifting trough space in hyper sleep for 57 years. Although her story about the Alien encounter is met with skepticism, she agrees to accompany a team of high-tech marines back to LV-426 and this time it's war! It has great cast I love the marines fighting aliens in this movie. The movie stars: Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, William Hope, Jenette Goldstein, Al Matthews, Mark Rolston , Ricco Ross, Colette Hiller, Daniel Kash ,Cynthia Dale Scott and Tip Tipping and they are all believable enough.I love the characters beside Ellen Ripley, Newt, Corporal Hicks, Bishop, Private Hudson, Private Vasquez, Sergeant Apone, Private Drake, Private Frost, Corporal Ferro, Private Spunkmeyer, Corporal Dietrich, Private Crowe I love those platoon of US Colonial Marines I know I haven't mentioned Burke because he was the bad guy and I don't like him. But most of the characters in this movie I love.  I know it is a sci-fi action film but it also does a have a horror mixed together people just don't see that. There's plenty of horror in it. The nightmare sequence in the beginning, the creepy atmosphere of the LV-426 colony, and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay. You see mother of those aliens who cocooned all the humans and killed them you see Ripley finding the nest and fight the Alien queen on the end. Ripley faces her fear and gets over her PTSD by going in by herself to rescue the Girl/Fight the Aliens/and Destroy the Entire Nest...Battles One on One with an Alien Queen and Whips its' Ass...and, by the end, now both her and Newt can dream without the worry of any more Nightmares (which plagued Ripley at the beginning of the film).This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1986!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores from James Horner of stuntmen used.10/10 I have the Blu-ray disc which it also have a special edition version on it I used to had this film on DVD but I throw it away because I bought the Blu-ray which I am very happy about it. I love this film to death it is my personal favorite sci-fi action film even Lance Henriksen from Hard Target and The Terminator is in here and he is the good guy.",10,171,192,13 February 2018
The Fast and the Furious," A solid entertainment weel done action heist movie
","The Fast and the Furious (2001) It is solid decent action film of the film franchise. I love this film it is my third favorite film in the series. I wasn't watching this film for the cars or street races this film is about robbery, as a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies rocks the area. The Team stole $1.2 million worth of major electronics and the cops doesn't have any leads who has done it. There is only one team that could be responsible, Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel) and his gang of street racers. During the night Torreto and his crew of street racers are driving cars in Los Angeles. Brian O'Conner (Paul walker) a undercover LAPD officer under the alias 'Brian Earl Spilner', is he assigned to find out who is stealing the merchandise. This is my favorite film, it is an decent Action film about heist $1.2 million and not about the cars. Why I love this film? Because It is clever, intelligent, Entertained, fast paced and not boring film. The girls are beautiful in this team. The Action sequences are real and perfectly done. I love that late Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner and undercover L.A. Police Officer who try's to do the right thing. I am Paul Walker fan and Brian O'Conner is my favorite character of the whole franchise and series. I am saying The Fast and the Furious is better than 2,3 and even 7 so the film is pretty good.Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster did a terrific job playing their characters.With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films..here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. These themes are reinforced by the fine performances by Paul Walker and, particularly, Vin Diesel. Diesel's Toretto is a tough, no-nonsense, street-smart and highly-skilled racer on the outside, but as O'Conner and the audience come to know him, it is revealed that he is a human being with feelings, a troubled and hard past, and doing his best to get along, even if it means skirting or breaking the law. He's the head of a household, and the patriarch of sorts of a gang that is more family than it is a collection of members. Diesel brings hard-nosed and gritty energy to the role, but compliments that with a softer, more accessible side that makes him an odd sort of antihero, a man clearly in the wrong but not maliciously or spitefully so. Walker, too, is excellent as the undercover officer that finds the world of underground racing not-so-seedy as it seems. On the turbo-charged streets of Los Angeles, every night is a championship race. With intense full-throttle action, awesome high-speed stunts, and full-on pedal to the metal intensity, this fast and furious assault puts you in the driver's seat and dares you to exceed all limits.Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Connor must decide where his loyalties really lie when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning. The Fast and the Furious is a gritty and gratifying cheap thrill, Rob Cohen's high-octane hot-car is a true rarity these days, a really good exploitation, the sort of thing that would rule at drive-ins if they still existed. The Fast and the Furious is a good Action movie. It offers a conventional plot but populates the story with well-developed primary characters that draw the audience in and make them care about their stories. In the movie, the line between good and bad becomes blurred to the point that, by the end, it matters not which side of the law the characters call home.I love this film to death! It is my 3d favorite film in the series franchise. The Fast and the Furious kicks ass! Even for PG-13 film they kick ass! Brian O'Conner kicks ass!!!",10,98,110,17 October 2015
Captain America: Civil War," I don't understand the hate a descent awesome MCU super action superhero - Captain America is the king
","I don't understand the hate for this movie it actually surprised me, I really enjoyed this film. Captain America: Civil War is a descent awesome MCU super action the third film of the Captain America trilogy. To me the second movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still the best one I just love that movie to death, but I like this one I love the first one but I just love all three of Captain America films. I thought the cast did a good job Chris Evens kicks ass once again he is Captain America and I look this movie from his point of view. He is really become my favorite hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Avengers films especially Age of Ultron, Captain America is still a guy who has a lot of screen time that it is the focus of a movie and he is still the guy I can take a side I agree with him, I can understand his choices.We have also almost everyone from Avengers films except Thor and Hulk actors Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo did not appear. Chris Hemsworth thought that MCU fired him because he was not cast as Thor but he was later explained that MCU wants his own movie and his own stand alone path which I can't wait for Thor: Ragnarok.The cast beside Chris Evens includes Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl.In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions-one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. We have two opposite teams now fighting each other: Team Iron Man: War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, The Vision, Spider-Man.Team Captain America: Hawkeye, Sharon Carter, Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch.The battle between Captain America and Iron Man draws a political line in the sand. On one side, you have Tony Stark, a man looking to protect the world from super-powered individuals who've proved in the past to be more destructive than helpful. On the other, you have Steve Rogers championing civil liberties. It's the age old debate of safety coming at the cost of freedom, and we'll get to see it play out to a hopefully satisfying conclusion this year.The action scenes are fantastic, the fight scenes on the airport are incredible heart pulse breath taking awesome. The fight scenes were very well done and well choreographed. I liked this movie more the story drew me in, the villain wasn't that good.Robert Downey Jr. does a good job, Paul Rudd he is fun in the flick, he has a great moment as Ant-Man he has a few moments but one predictable. Scarlett Johansson did great! Black Widow kicked ass specially in the beginning of the flick. Anthony Mackie I really like him as Falcon he as a lot of good stuff in this. He was down played in Age of Ultron but has a lot screen time in here which was excellent and they made that for that in this one I am glad for it. Anthony Mackie has a lot of good screen time, specially in the action moments. Falcon has a remote control like a mini Flacon I thought that was really cool. Chris Evens is to root for this character, Black Panther interesting the actor playing black panther was really good I like him and I am really interested seeing his up coming movie. Bucky Barnes: Winter Soldier did fine.A lot of people are complain about how terrible this movie is I am sorry I don't see it that way, I don't see at all it is peace of sh**. I wish that Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow / Crossbones wouldn't die and it was nice to see him in the beginning of the movie. I still wish he would work for the villain I still enjoy his screen time.I thought Chris Evens and Robert Downey Jr, did work great as a opposite team. I love the end of fighting between Cap, Iron Man and Bucky Barnes. I thought the last fight scene was well choreographed I honestly think Iron Man would have won and he would killed Bucky Barnes. If Cap wouldn't have hurt his heart. I know when Tony find out Bucky killed his parents and he killed his mom in 1991 he decide to kill him. I mourn with Tony and it was a great dialogue 'That shield doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve it! My father made that shield!' Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.I understand the hate, because Captain turn the law politics back to save his friend, but he actually try to safe an innocent man who was framed by Zemo. Captain America Civil War WAS BETTER THAN X-MEN APOCALYPSE, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Man of Steel and Deadpool I don't like those movies they are peace of sh** and too way overrated. The rating I am giving is 10/10",10,183,268,2 July 2017
Die Hard 2," Die Hard 2 is my all time personal favorite Action film an underrated
","Die Hard 2 in my opinion is my third favorite decent action flick in a 'Die Hard' series and a good movie to watch. It is one of my personal favorite action movies. It is one of the most underrated 'Die Hard' films in the series and that not a bad one. His wife again a hostage, Christmas again, the same reporter from the 1st film, now a janitor Marvin is a helper instead of Argyle and so on. As far as sequels go, Die Hard 2 is excellent. Of course it isn't better than the first, but sequels rarely are. This film is like going to a circus: you sit back and watch crazy stuff happen, laugh, cheer, joke, and just have a good time. Bruce Willis gives a great performance in the lead, we have some solid villains, and some brilliant action set pieces. I say check it out. I'm not one to subtract points for a lack of realism, or 'real world believability' in films. Because of that, Die Hard 2 poses a very interesting case study for me. Real world believability is very difficult to not think about when watching this film. Why wouldn't the planes just reroute to other nearby airports? There are a bunch less than an hour's flight away, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, the three New York City-area airports, and so on. Why wouldn't they be able to call another close airport, or the Pentagon, or somewhere else nearby to have them contact the planes? They're near Washington, D.C., after all (don't forget that Dulles is 26 miles away from D.C., in Virginia, making it unlikely that planes out of fuel would begin 'dropping on the White House lawn'). It seems like maybe this film should have been set somewhere like Salt Lake City, Utah instead. Why wouldn't they be able to show the runways through some other means, like a line of emergency or police vehicles with their sirens on? If the 'terrorists' started shooting at the vehicles, or trying to blow them up, at least they'd be given an indication where the fire is coming from/given their location. Just how likely would it be that there's a big storm in the area on the day when General Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero) is being extradited? How likely is it that he'd be extradited on Christmas Eve? Why the hell is John standing out on the runway in the snow waving a couple of flaming poles--just what does he think that will do? Die Hard 2 is still awesome movie and sequel to the first one for me and I don't know why people are saying it is the worst one or why they hate it. I don't, I love it, more than the first one I love it. In 2005 was my first best action movie than the first one. What I love about this film is they show John McClain more as a human being. In the beginning at the airport when his car was taken away at the airport, the whole movie show's an actual terror the villains are more of a threat cause they're actual terrorists! The Action sequences are awesome, there is barely any Cgi in it, John McClane is again in another elevator shafts. I love the plot twist that was wonderful, the snow in the film, the mobile snow chase whit McClane was awesome. This film is not perfect It is good, it has some problems in it. Always enjoyed watching it. The problems for the airport I already mentioned, the most annoying to me was after McClane kills the henchman when he was saving Leslie Barnes he pushed a terrorist of the latter and that latter tower falls on a terrorist you can see that it is a dummy from close that should not been seen from close camera.It is still It is one of my personal favorite action movies mostly in the winter when it is snowing. The first movie was hug success, Renny Harlin's job by making this movie make it even harder for him, to find a good story, and make a snow because they didn't had any actual snow at the time it was really hard. I love it. The facts I love: Chase with the Snowmobile, shooting with blanks on Carmine Lorenzo, fights on an airplane, double cross, John's jokes... The General Esperanza on airplane from Val Verde the same country was named in Schwarzenegger's movie Commando, John's shooting with snowmobile, than John's fight by the church. Movie to me is really awesome. I enjoy watching Die Hard 2. 10/10 Grade: Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval It is my second favorite Die Hard film in the series.",10,100,109,4 October 2015
Resident Evil," The best one in the series, amazing horror sci-fi action flick based on a video game - my favorite!
","Resident Evil (2002) is my favorite horror sci-fi action flick that is based on a video game and it is my second favorite film from Paul W. S. Anderson! It is favorite horror sci-fi action flick of mine and I love this film to death! By far one of the best horror films ever made! Milla Jovovich is a sexy actress and plays a perfect role for this movie. For 2002 the special effects are amazing and the acting was great. Definitely the best out of the three. I Wouldn't Say Its A Horror Movie, Yet I'm Not Saying Its Not. This (Along With Underworld, Van Helsing and More) Is a strange combination of Horror, Action, & Sci-Fi. If someone asked me what genre It is I would probably say Horror. Horror is supposed to scare you. This makes you say 'Holy Crap This Is Cool.' either way awesome movie. Plot: Alice (Milla Jovovich), a young woman who along with fellow survivors must find a way to escape a underground bio facility that is infested with zombies. The film would launch the Resident Evil film series. Something rotten is brewing beneath the industrial mecca known as Raccoon City. Unknown to its millions of residents, a huge underground bio engineering facility known as The Hive has accidentally unleashed the deadly and mutating T-virus, killing all of its employees. To contain the leak, the governing supercomputer, Red Queen, has sealed all entrances and exits. Now a team of highly-trained super commandos including Rain (Michelle Rodriguez - The Fast and the Furious, Girlfight), Alice (Milla Jovovich - The Fifth Element) and Matt (Eric Mabius - Cruel Intentions) must race to penetrate The Hive in order to isolate the T-virus before it overwhelms humanity. To do so, they must get past the Red Queen's deadly defenses, face the flesh-eating undead employees, fight killer mutant dogs and battle The Licker, a genetically mutated savage beast whose strength increases with each of its slain victims.'...Mila Jovovich is a first-rate action heroine.'This film has everything it is a zombie movie, about plague a deadly T-virus that infected its employees and turned them in to a bloody thirsty eating human zombies! It has deadly booby traps, killer mutant dogs, the Licker mutant zombie. The action is great, the horror in this movie is visually scary. Michelle Rodriguez from The Fast and the Furious is excellent I love her character Rain Ocampo she was a tough special forces commando soldier in this flick. But Mila Jovovich is a bad ass, she is so hot and sexy I am kind of jealous on Paul W.S. Anderson for having so sexy and beautiful heroine for his wife. I love this flick and I love the songs in this movie. We have Eric Mabius from The Crow: Salvation I love the songs for this movie: My Plague (New Abuse Mix) - by Slipknot and Invisible Wounds (Dark Bodies) by Fear Factory. The movie itself is very good, it's a zombie flick but as some others have stated, not retarded or boring, it's actually a great movie with not a lot that I need to complain about, good characters, action sequences, story, game-references, dialogue, suspense, etc....I don't think I need to say too much there.Overall: I am going to give this movie a 10 out of 10, this is the best one in the series and no sequel can overpass the original. What else can one say about the Resident Evil franchise: as far as basing a movie off of a video game, Resident Evil has to be one of the best adaptations ever. It keeps the broad strokes of the game intact while creating a new character, Alice, that everyone can instantly identify with. Milla Jovovich takes the action hero foundation she laid in The Fifth Element and builds on it to make herself perhaps the first female action superstar. I love this film to death and it is my favorite film in the franchise it is still a true horror film! Resident Evil is a 2002 science fiction action horror film written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. The film stars Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez. It is the first installment in the Resident Evil film series, which is loosely based on the Capcom survival horror video game series Resident Evil.10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Screen Gems Constantin Film Starring: Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Martin Crewes, Colin Salmon Director: Paul W.

Independence Day," A classic Sci-Fi blockbuster of summer 1996
","Independence Day (1996) is a classic Sci-Fi blockbuster of summer 1996, it was actually released the year that I was 12 years old and this film become a hit in Slovenia and it was released in movie theater's. This movie is directed by German director Roland Emmerich who also directed Universal Soldier (1992) with Jean-Claude Van Damme my favorite movie that I love to death and it is my first favorite movie of Roland Emmerich! Independence Day is the second favorite film of mine that I love to death from this director! I love this film to death, it is my favorite alien invasion sci-fi action film. The film is rated PG-13 and even with less violence this film still brings been entertaining and very interesting action movie. Of all the 90's action movies that focus more on airplanes are only two movies from the 90's I consider been best: Die Hard 2 and Independence Day I love them to death! This film stars: Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia and Randy Quaid.War of the Worlds (2005) remake with Tom Cruise is the only movie that I know about alien invasions and I can say is not as a good as Independence Day. I thought War of the Worlds was kinda boring film and too over long. I do have that movie on Blu-ray disc because of Tom Cruise collection but I still I am bored to death with that movie. This film is the opposite of War of the Worlds and the remake can't beat this classic epic sci-fi action film. Plot: Independence Day is a 1996 science fiction action film that follows the citizens of Earth who band together to repel alien invaders determined to take the world by force.The film was be followed twenty years later in 2016 with the sequel Independence Day: Resurgence. I still have to watch the sequel which I am very excited to see that film. This flick has a great talented cast such as Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and Robert Loggia. The movie has a great practical special effects, heroism and characters that are written easily likable and sure the movie it's over the top sometimes and it doesn't hold up as maybe it did 20 years ago but it still does it's job pretty well and it's without a doubt the best film of Roland Emmerich next to Universal Soldier. The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the Nevada desert in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an extraterrestrial race of unknown origin. Along with the rest of the human population, they launch a last-ditch counterattack on July 4 – the same date as Independence Day in the United States. It has good action, good story, good characters, good mix of computer, models and practical effects which still hold up to this very day. A little trivia, when Bill Pullman gave his speech about how they are going to fight back against the aliens, I think when people saw this in South America that they actually believed Bill Pullman was the President which shows how great his acting was in this film. The scene where it is the aftermath after the attack, and we see the Statue of Liberty destroyed that was a homage to the original Planet of the Apes movie where Charlten Heston finds the Statue of Liberty destroyed. I enjoy a lot of great and funny scenes with Will Smith character when he punches the alien and says 'Welcome to Earth!' and then grabs the cigar and said, 'Now, that's what I call a close encounter!' I totally disagree with some people who didn't care for it especially critics, it was way better than that awful 'Skyline' and the 'War of the Worlds' remake. In my honest I'm definitely not looking forward to the new sequel that come out, but I am going to gave a shot even tough I hear mainly negative stuff about it. Overall: Independence Day is a good movie to watch on 4th of July the same date that holiday Independence Day is in the United States. 10/10 still is Roland Emmerich best film! Independence Day is a 1996 American science fiction action film directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: 20TH Century Fox Starring: Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Margaret Colin, Vivica A.

Batman Begins," Rebirth Of A Legend - The greatest reboot of an origin story!
","Batman Begins (2005) is actually great reboot of The Dark Knight trilogy and a start of the origin tale of Batman, but is not the best one in the series, that will be The Dark Knight (2008). Batman Begins is strayed from the comic books. My DC comic super hero on a 1st rank will always be Batman I always love Batman from comic books, cartoons and movies more than other superheroes. The first time I saw this movie, I didn't like it because I thought, it was boring and I didn't got the story. I grew up with Batman (1989) Michael Keaton and I did too loved much more than this one. But than I kept watching and watching it and I fall in love it, It always entertained me. In my opinion Christopher Nolan's and Burton's Batman are all great movies. If it weren't for its amazing sequel this would be the greatest superhero film ever made. The film that started it all... a Batman film but with a more realistic, gritty and original approach. If your a fan of Batman and you haven't seen this you are going to LOVE every minute. It is smart, innovative, awe-inspiring and for a bat-fan, iconic. Christopher Nolan focuses on the origin and story behind a man standing against justice rather than the quirky early attempts. Its just a shame that this isn't as popular as The Dark Knight because it deserves the glory just as much. If your new and you've only just seen TDK, watch this purely because it catapulted this reinvention of a hero to great heights. TDK has the rise of The Clown Prince Of Crime and the escallation that was inevitable. Batman Begins has the creation of Batman and the lengths of which he had to go in order to combat injustice in a city that did not know justice. Watch this, it is a classic. What I like in Batman Begins is the origin story. I like that the movie focus on a comic book movie sadly Burton Batman doesn't follow on Batman origin story but follows more Joker story and I didn't pay for this movie to see Katie Holmes but naked and to be laid I am glad he didn't do that don't get me wrong but I don't like action hero's that always, always get a girl at the end of the movie and get laid I hate that! I am glad this was the beginning of Batman and the film took a different turn. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) did not get laid or get the girl once. I love this movie and I am true Batman fan I always was more Batman fan than a Superman fan. Bruce Wayne being trained and been ninja the long path how he become Batman the fighting the suit the climbing the wall. Car chases, action sequences are awesome! The actors: Christian Bale is an excellent darker Batman. He acted perfectly his role as Bruce and Batman the same time. I love Liam Neeson I think that actor did a wonderful convincing performance as Ducard/Ra's Al Ghul. He deserve a credit for his role that this movie redeem it self. Liam Neeson was terrific awesome convincing actor. This role was one of the reason why I become Liam Neeson fan and I enjoy his new action thrillers: Taken, Walk Among the Tombstones , Non-Stop, Taken 2 and Unknown. Rutger Hauer was awesome did you know he had a small role in comic book series Smallville? He was in Season 3 Episode 1 & 2. Cillian Murphy was great as Scarecrow! I love him and Tom Wilkinson was awesome too! Gary Oldman was amazing as Jim Gordon.Things I don't like in this movie: Batman Begins was really slow, the first hour of the movie was boring and really dramatic. The fighting sequence in this movie were shot to close with camera so we barely see a any fights between Batman and Ra's Al Ghul. Bruce Wayne blamed him self for his parents death. It wasn't his fault! The murder of his parents was too much dramatic too much for my eyes and Katie Holmes sadly I don't like her in this movie I would replace her with Maggie Gyllenhall or any other actress. I thought Maggie portrayed Rachel Dawes much better and made a better job in the sequel than Katie Holmes did. The fight between Batman and Ras' Al Ghul on a train I don't like it. Because the fight scene is too close, you can barely see who hit's who. That is the thing, that bothers me the most in this movie. The fight scenes in Burton's Batman are so much better, awesome than in Christopher Nolan's Batman and he could have made the fights scenes believable like Burton did. Peace <3./: I love this movie and it is a 9 by me.

The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Defending an Underrated Sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park
","I still don't get the hate for The Lost World: Jurassic Park and the love for Jurassic Park III? Can Someone explain to me why is III in your opinion so much better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park is? In my opinion III lacks on the story and is not terrible because Steven Spielberg did not Direct the movie but it is terrible because the whole movie makes no damn sense it is too short, it lacks on the story and is really awful to me. It has no character development in III at all and lying to Dr. Grant and trick him on that island is just inhuman and awful. And Why is Jurassic World so much better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park? I am sorry is not better than the second movie. In my opinion is not, but is at least better than Jurassic Lark III is but is not any better over The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997).An Underrated classic sequel in the series and the last movie directed by Steven Spielberg. I have enjoyed this movie much better than Jurassic Park III and Jurassic World. The movie is very bashed and criticized by their fans of the first film. Just like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom this is the sequel that is very bashed from critics and fans again. This is the first and unfortunately last great sequel to the original Jurassic Park. I think Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore did a good job on there performances. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is like Godzilla T-Rex in San Diego. I still love This movie a very underrated science fiction/action sequel film in The Jurassic Park entry franchise. I think for it's sequel it had a good start running. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is loosely based on Michael Crichton's 1995 novel The Lost World.The film won 1 award for Best Effects and Visual Effects. Things I don't like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it:The daughter of Ian is black in here,which makes to me no sense since Ian is white. Vince Vaughn was unnecessary to cast him and unneeded. I seriously hate Vince Vaughn,this is a science fiction/Action film not a comedy Vince get this in your head! Vince stole Roland Tembo bullets for his shot gun and with that action Vince jeopardized and put whole people in the camp in the mortal danger and T-Rex come after them and eat bunch of people cause of him. Roland could shot the T-Rex and save people and because of Vince's action he couldn't. I seriously hate Vince Vaughn for this. I am glad he was cut by the end of the film.Peter Stormare/Compys sequences from swarm of Compsognathus knock him and killing him were really unnecessary and unneeded etc.), plus it has a sluggish pace and such.Baby T-Rex in this movie was extremely annoying and his yelling in the trailer and in the car it annoyed me so much and on end of the movie.Thing's I love in this movie: T-Rex dinosaur in a city San Diego, the chase and eating people in the city are awesome. Ian and Sarah drive to the amphitheater harbor and pick up the infant. They make sure they bait the creature with its infant and drive back to the docks and place the infant in the cargo hold of the ship.Sarah prepares a sedative dart and shoots the T. Rex as Malcolm closes the cargo hold door, trapping the animals inside. Awesome! Surviving hunters travel through an open field of tall grass. Ajay tries to warn them, shouting 'DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS!' but none of them listens and are killed one by one by Velociraptors.Pete Postlethwaite as Roland Tembo as famous animal hunter was awesome, I seriously I love the actor and his character, He came to Isla Sorna along with his hunting partner, Ajay Sidhu, in hopes of gaining the ultimate trophy and not for the money a male T. Rex.He survived in this movie. A shame a good actor Pete Postlethwaite died 4.years ago and he is not with us anymore. Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park (1993) and Julianne Moore as Dr. Sarah Harding did a good job on there performances.Returning of John Hammond his nephews Tim and Lex the same actors from Jurassic park (1993). Tim and Lex had a brief cameo but John did had a cameo on the end of the movie. Daughter Kelly to do some a gymnastics and kick a little raptor trough the window was really a bad ass awesome.Cgi and the film effects wasn't that bad either they were really good. John Williams did return as music composer and he did return with his theme music score. Like its predecessor, The Lost World: Jurassic Park was scored by famed composer John Williams (a longtime collaborator with director Steven Spielberg).John Williams didn't write a stereotypical sequel score, but instead developed a wildly different style for the different location, cast, and darker tone of the second Jurassic Park film.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a 1997 American science fiction adventure film. It is the second installment in the Jurassic Park film series. A sequel to 1993's Jurassic Park.I love Jurassic Park (1993) as everyone do but I also love The Lost World: Jurassic Park. NOTE: I still take this movie over Jurassic World and over Jurassic Lark III anytime. Grade: A- 9.5/10",5,99,141,8 August 2015
Get Out," This movie sucks overrated over-hyped sh***y goddamn awful horror movie
","*SPOILERS* This movie awful sucks! It is overrated over-hyped and a copycat this film imitates and steals mostly ideas and scenes from Disturbing Behavior. Let me explain:In Disturbing Behavior a mad but brilliant scientist brainwashes and operates on young high school students and he turns them in to obeying upstanding citizens cyborg's. The only way you can ruin the cyborg personality is with a loud sound on the radio that makes them mad and disturbed them.In Get Out A Young white bisexual girl seduces Afro American boys and girls then she and her family captures them, then they brainwash them the same that was in Disturbing Behavior and then they turn them in to obeying slave's cyborgs. The only thing you awake them is buy shooting a picture with a flashback on your photo camera so that they awake from their nightmare.Get Out copy's and imitates Disturbing Behavior on a bad way, it is similar story. I am not getting this movie a pass just because it try's to be scary this movie failed and it is a failure in my opinion.I don't like this movie I don't like new horror movies because they are not good and they don't know how to make a good horror film! This movie fails to be a good slasher film, it fails, it is boring way too long, it is not exciting it is not the best horror movie the critics are saying. It is not intense or exciting and it is not interesting at all.I don't care about the lead guy and his girlfriend she is a selfish monster and he find out when it was all too late what a dumbass. Catherine Keener what the hell happened with you? You were so beautiful and so damn hot in The 40 Year Old Virgin once beautiful, intelligent very smart, funny and goofy in this movie your fat and very dumb and ugly. You changed lady and that in too ugly one I don't like you today or in this movie.This film should have been straight out to Blu-ray and DVD I don't understand why everyone LOVES this movie so good I don't understand I respect people for others who likes this movie that's fine but I am only guy who hates this film a lot because I thought it was very silly writing of film I thought the all idea of it looks and sounds silly like story is written buy group of kids in grade 1 written this story.I don't understand this movie or why was so god damn awful acted ,it was really slow only the end was intense when Daniel fought for his life but that was it. And his fight on the end was terrible I did not like it at all.This movie wasn't scary enough and it wasn't scary at all. I think the movie get's high rating then any Friday the 13th movies, get's higher rating then any Child's Play that's my problem. Like new movies who are horrendous horrible get's the pass but the old one great slasher films get's thumbs down.This movie can kiss my ass I have seen better horror film from 2000's that really got worst ratings and ranted on a worst.Another spoiler for you: when Daniel is captured and chained on that chair and he was hypnotized by large TV Screen how did he got wads in his ears and plugs his ears with a tied hands how did he do that? How did he reached the wads from the sofa chair he was siting? Does anyone has an explanation how did he do that when he was all tied up? I know he scratched the sofa chair out just how did he reach the wads from his hands and how did he plugged his ears when he was all tied up. It makes no sense to me. I don't know why this movie get's the pass I don't understands. 1/10 awful lame horrible movie a total disappointment and a failure I don't want to watch this movie again.I am rather going to watch Friday the 13th movies, A Nightmare on Elm Street movies, The Thing, Prince of Darkness, The Fog, Leviathan, House of Wax, The Hills Have Eyes the remake, Scream movies Miles better movies then this overrated peace a sh**T!",1,23,51,12 September 2017
X-Men: The Last Stand," A good X-Men movie but a minor disappointment.
","X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) is a good superhero movie, but way down than the first two films were. It wasn't a bad film that would be Days of Future Past and Origins Wolverine I just like this film a lot of better then the new X-Men films. Well I love it. It is my favorite movie of all X-Men. People who criticize this movie and saying bad things about it seriously get the hell out of my face and you don't get it at all. [:To me it was a great movie and I love it. I love the new mutants they are more mutants. At the end they are all six mutants. I am a fan of Wolverine and Storm. I love when Wolverine was fighting against mutants and Magneto's army in the woods he come back for Jean Phoenix. Than they find a cure against mutants to become a humans again it was a little boy and Magneto wanted him dead. The fight scene between Pyro and iceman was fantastic. Pyro was with Professor X in the second movie but than he cross the line and he become magneto's alley. Mystique become human again after one cop throw on Magneto the cure and she saved him. What Magneto did? He throw her away because she was a human and he said she is not one of them anymore. So Mystique betrayed magneto and she told authorities were is Magneto's hide out. 'Hell has no fury like a women scorned.' Jean Phoenix did died at the end of the second movie but she come back in this one. Wolverine loved her more than Cyclops actually did. It was sad that he had to killed her at the end but she was a treat to all of us. The first appearance of Henry 'Hank' McCoy / Beast he was never mentioned in the first two movies. I love the finale battle, they are more mutants in this one, than they were in the first two movies. Final conclusion and end to the trilogy. Wolverine stays at the school at the end without professor X I really love it. I know a lot of people will say that I am stupid for liking this movie. And I am really not a big comic book fan of this movie because I don't know everything but I really love it. But is not my best favorite movie.X-Men: The Last Stand has a few put holes and errors: Like death of Professor X the return of Phoenix from the grave when she died at the end of the second movie. Mysterious death of Scott Summers Cyclops. I also don't think that he is dead, there was no body and he does also not do anything in this movie. Than Rouge,she doesn't fly she doesn't even fight. All she does is complaining and waning about been a mutant and not been a human. She is useless here. The third installment into the trilogy, is a good film in their own way. But not my best favorite movie. That would be X2 and than is X-Men because, it is the first movie I watch in the summer 2001 on tape and it is the second best one for me. X2: X-Men United is better than both of them together but to me are all three good one of the X-Men trilogy. What could have been an epic conclusion to the X-trodinary trilogy, was a minor disappointment, Gone is Byran Singer who left the project to direct Superman Returns, in comes Bret (I only work with Jackie Chan) Ratner. He's OK, but he's no Singer. It also sucks that characters you care for get killed off in such un-ethical ways. Oh well. It is not the film that people except but is not by the worst one for me. I love action and this is a science fiction, action flick. It has a lot of changes which it sucks but it is still an enjoyable flick. Experience the awesome power of The X-Men's epic, final battle. Join well-known mutant heroes and villains, and meet a cadre of all-new warriors -- including Angel, Beast, Juggernaut and Colossus -- in this thrilling, explosive adventure! After a controversial cure is discovered, mutants can choose to retain their superhuman abilities or give up their unique gifts and become normal. When peaceful mutant leader Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) clashes with his militant counterpart, Magneto (Ian McKellen), the battle lines are drawn for the war to end all wars. Bursting with nonstop action and spectacular special effects, X-Men The Last Stand is a force of nature that will blow you away!I am sorry if you disagree with me. A disappointment but still a good film. X-Men: The Last Stand (also known as X-Men 3 or X3) is a 2006 American superhero film, based on the X-Men superhero team introduced in Marvel Comics. The film, distributed by 20th Century Fox, is the sequel to 2003's X2 and the third installment in the X-Men film series. 7/10 Score: B Studio: 20TH Century Fox, Marvel Studios Starring: Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Kelsey Grammar, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn, Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford, Vinnie Jones, Patrick Stewart Director: Brett Ratner Producers: Lauren Shuler Donner, Ralph Winter, Avi Arad Screenplay: Simon Kinberg, Zak Penn Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 1 Hr. 44 Mins.

The Bourne Legacy," Great action sequences but that doesn't say much it is not a good movie!
","*SPOILERS* Oh boy The Bourne Legacy is not a good movie, but it is way better than Jason Bourne but worse movie than The Bourne Ultimatum. It has great action sequences better than In The Bourne Ultimatum, but that doesn't say much. I never liked The Bourne Ultimatum and I don't like this movie ether. It is not a good movie and I really don't care that there is no Jason Bourne in this movie. I would say it is solid but the character Aaron Cross does not work for me, he is selfish and useless to me a real dead agent! All he cared was to get the Virus and those pills to survive. He saved Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) by agents only to used her to get the pills and the Virus so that he could survive. Seriously this movie is horrible, the plot is weak, not logic and an interesting science fiction movie the lead character Aaron Cross is not likable.This movie is way too long and really boring at sometimes. I like Edward Norton in this he was fantastic I love the actor he is acting skills are fantastic. I actually cared more about Norton's character than Renner character. The airplane vehicle Predator, an unmanned aerial vehicle like the one featured was excellent weapon and I like it. The motor chase was a really decent action stunt in which Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz real performed. That is why I can say the action sequence is much way better than it was performed in Bourne Ultimatum. Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner were fantastic and acting from them was really good and I like it. I only liked these three actors I mentioned Edward Norton, Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz and the motor chase sequence an that is all the rest of the movie is useless to me and an watchable except if I want to waste my time. The plot, the sci-fi and the story just didn't worked for me. I didn't like how this movie crucified Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) as the fall guy and the CIA covered everything up and get away with their crimes I really did not like that. I don't understand this movie, Aaron almost did not do anything trough entire movie, he escaped the CIA agents but the bad guy got away he didn't expose them he did not do nothing but run which it is stupid. Someone said it is way better than The Bourne Identity well it is not, it is worse than Bourne Identity. This is not a real spy movie, there are no espionage in here at all. I would rather watch James Bond Movies, The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, XIII: The Conspiracy, The Hunt For Red October, Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger miles way better movies than Bourne Legacy.The rating for me is F 1/10 I don't hate the movie, but I don't like it, it is not a good action movie like everyone is saying it is just a waste of time. The movie starts slow, it is boring, not enjoyable and forgettable.",1,3,9,10 December 2016
The Game," Classic psychological underrated mystery thriller, Michael Douglas best!
","A classic mystery thriller the best of Michael Douglas he ever made with David Fincher I love this film to death! It is my third favorite Michael Douglas film. This is my Favorite David Fincher Flick. The first time I saw it I fall in love with it and I kept watching it, since my teen years it is my favorite Michael Douglas film. The Game (1997) is a terrific mystery thriller and it is David Fincher's third feature film and very underrated among st his work. This is a thrilling mystery, that keeps guessing you if it is everything real or just a fiction. David Fincher and Michael Douglas did a terrific and outstanding job. I remember seeing an VHS in the bookstore on a sell page, I wish I would bought this film on VHS than, but lucky I have it on Blu-ray disc. This was a hit in 1997 back than when the movie come out. I even have a co worker who went to see this film in a movie theater. I am going to say it again I love this film to death and I love Michael Douglas! 'I'm being toyed with by a bunch of depraved children...' Plot: Wealthy San Francisco financier Nicholas Van Orton gets a strange birthday present from wayward brother Conrad: a live-action game that consumes his life.THERE ARE NO RULES IN THE GAME. And that will make life very difficult for Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas). a successful businessman who is always in control. Van Orton lives a well-ordered life - until an unexpected birthday gift from his brother (Sean Penn) destroys it all. Van Orton has been enrolled in a game - 'a profound life experience' - that begins quietly enough but soon erupts in a rush of devastating and bizarre events. Like it or not, he must either win the game or lose control of everything in his life.The movie is a mystery about a game from a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) it is a game like a vacation for holidays, just the vacation comes to you. This is a birthday gift from Connie (Sean Penn) to his brother Nicholas (Michael Douglas). When the game starts you keep thinking this is for real and people are really trying to kill Nicholas to get his money. First they screwed up his brother and now they want to screw him over.This is very, very well directed thriller and Michael Douglas best performance ever. I found the ending to be brilliant and makes sense. Deborah Kara Unger was extremely gorgeous and very hot sexy babe! I was even in love with her after seeing her in this movie. The scene in which protagonist Van Orton finds a life-size clown doll in his driveway was ranked #44 on Bravo's list of The 100 Scariest Movie Moments.For a David Fincher fan like myself, there are movies that I actually like they are: Se7en, Zodiac and of course Panic Room (2002) this was the film I went to see it in the movie theater in June 2002, when it was by us released in Slovenia it was actually the first Jodie Foster film I saw in a movie theater. But The Game will always be my favorite David Fincher film and Michael Douglas's third favorite film. I also do think this movie is very underrated and some people don't like it. Well I don't like Fight Club and I am probably the only one , but The Game I love to death. I heard years ago that Michael Douglas had a fun making this film with David Fincher and he would love to do another thriller with Fincher again, if Fincher would offer him another movie role.My favorite scene in the film is with the taxi cab when the taxi driver leaves him alone the car and the car drives on the pier in the water and Nicholas open's the window with that hook he received for the game package. I love when operatives of CRS are using suppressed Heckler & Koch MP5K's automatic machine gun to shoot the apartment of Christine (Deborah Kara Unger) and opens fire on Nicholas. Nicholas leaps off the skyscraper and crashes through a glass ceiling, but he lands safely in an airbag. There he finds his family and friends awaiting his arrival and The Game is revealed to have just been a game. The accounts have not been drained, the gun was replaced with one firing blanks, and his brother is alive.I am giving this film a perfect 10 out of 10 which I do believe is a classic David Fincher's underrated psychological best mystery thriller. Mine favorite Michael Douglas film of all time I love it! The Game is a 1997 American mystery thriller film directed by David Fincher, starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn, and produced by Propaganda Films and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. It tells the story of a wealthy investment banker who is given a mysterious gift: participation in a game that integrates in strange ways with his everyday life. As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio Studio: PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, Universal Studios Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger, Peter Donat, Carroll Baker, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Anna Katarina, Charles Martinet Director: David Fincher Producers: Steve Golin, CeÃ¡n Chaffin Screenplay: John Brancato and Michael Ferris Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hr. 9 Mins.

Ghostbusters," Classic, original, best supernatural comedy's masterpiece!
","This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CGI.Ghostbusters (1984) is the best classic original spectacular supernatural masterpiece from Ivan Reitman! One of if not the greatest films ever! My favorite film of all time! 'Ghostbusters' is the film that made me become a fan ever since I was young! It had an awesome cast, cool special effects, hilarious dialogue and a kick-ass soundtrack! The film that can be watched over and over again! I grew up watching Ghostbusters on TV and the animated TV series The Real Ghostbusters (1986 - 1991). Ghostbusters II (1989) actually introduced me in to Ghostbusters. I loved them so much that I even said to my mom, when I grown up I will be a Ghostbuster! It was my fantasy. Watching it yesterday and I still love it. I love this flick to death! I still can't believe it how the world changed and how in the 80's the world was better than today! I always have enjoyed the sequel much better than as a child, it was my first movie but now as an adult, I love and enjoy the original movie to death! It is the only movie I own on Blu-ray disc and I still love it. This is an amazing movie! Funny, smart, well written and directed. It features an outstanding performance from Bill Murray, great showings by Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis and one of the last documented instances of Dan Aykroyd being funny on film (he was blown by a ghost!). In fact, the film gets a great performances from nearly everyone who appears in it- from Annie Potts, to the guy who played Lenny the Mayor, to the handsome cab driver who calls Rick Moranis an asshole. In addition, they had one of the best 'a-hole' guys ever to appear on film, as the film's bad guy- I'm talking of course of the grossly under-rated William Atherton- who played the EPA guy, 'Dickless'. Atherton, of course went on to play memorable a-holes in Real Genius and of course he was the annoying reporter in Die Hard (1988) but here in Ghostbusters, you really see a solid performance by maybe the best guy to play an a-hole in films in the 80's. Next Year the reboot is coming out as Paul Feig's Ghostsnuters, Ghostbitches or Ghostflufers./: Ghostbusters (2016) with women now as a Ghostbusters! Why rebooting this awesome supernatural spectacular comedy flick? I know the sequel failed and Bill Murray did not want anything to do with it. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't have made Ghostbusters III in the 90's, they should have! Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis tried so hard to convince Bill Murray to do it for the third sequel and they couldn't convinced him. They are going to ruin the Original movie! I don't want to see Ghostbusters with a female leads. Come on? The girls are not the Ghostbusters, they are three man a scientists and a one civilian. The Ghostbusters are the only one Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Bill Murray. They were always be the Ghostbusters that will be the case. No one else will be! No one else will replace them! This is like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) that come out the same year as the Ghostbusters did, they remake it and that remake failed!! It was awful boring! Why remaking or rebooting my classic horror comedy's that I Love?! Ghostbusters (1984) are unique, classic 80's masterpiece! These were the best times for movies ever!!! One of my favorite soundtracks and movie of all time!They just don't make them like this anymore. This is comedic writing and performance at its peak... with quotes that everyone knows and enjoys. From 'This reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head' to 'Symmetrical book stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947' to 'Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you! ' this is a CLASSIC movie! Ghostbusters is a true classic comedy that stands the test of time. The film is funny, awesome and entertaining. It has a lot of laughs. I love the soundtrack Ghostbusters Written and Performed by Ray Parker Jr. I think he did made a great soundtrack in the 80's. If there's something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? GHOSTBUSTERS!!!! A film that can be watched with the various youngest to the very oldest of the family. Wonderful collection of characters. A film that is treasured by just about everyone that watches it. I miss movies from the 80's and this film felt so realistic. Sigourney Weaver was just so outstanding as Dana Barrett after she made the horror flick Alien (1979 and Aliens (1986). Ghostbusters is a 1984 American supernatural comedy film, directed and produced by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. The film stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Columbia Pictures, Black Rhino Delphi Productions Starring: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, William Atherton, Ernie Hudson Director: Ivan Reitman Producer: Ivan Reitman Screenplay: Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis Rated: PG Running Time: 1 Hrs. 45 Mins.

Gran Torino," Highly overrated and one of the most boring and worst movies of Eastwood.
","*** Spoilers Alert ***Before I get started I love Clint Eastwood and his movies. I love Unforgivable and Million Dollar Baby to death. This are one of the best epic movies that Clint Eastwood directed. I love Dollars aka Man With No Name Trilogy, Dirty Harry franchise series all of them to death. High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, The Outlaw Josey Wales, The Rookie, Absolute Power, True Crime, Blood Work, Where Eagles Dare and Kelly's Heroes. Gran Torino fails highly, Clint Eastwood is a racist in this movie and trough whole movie he does nothing but bad mouthing and judging people insulting a Chinese child and his Chinese People. His own son and his family does not respect him so no one does.I have a problem that trough whole movie I saw Eastwood's son only three times and only what he cared was him self and his wife and children. What a selfish prick, Eatswood made a selfish not caring character for his son. They are Asian Gangs and all Eastwood does is showing a gun beating some guy and talking his war experience and showing his fingers as some old cowboy but that is all he does. They are showing a realistic racism Drama. But I didn't pay to see a racism drama I pay to see Clint Eastwood Kick Ass!!! The Gang one of Tao Chinese kid cousin drove with the car and they start shooting on his own relative house because Eastwood interfered and beat one of the gang member by warning him to stay away from Tao.Why they did shoot of the leader's cousin's house and he was involved?, Tao or his family didn't attacked them, Eastwood did why not shooting his house instead?. This movie also impersonates scenes from Steven Seagal's action movies Marked for Death and Out For Justice. Even Marked for Death was million times better. When Eastwood at the end shows up by gang's house and he grab in the pocket for lighter and than gang blows him away. Similar scene I saw in Seagal's action movie Out for Justice where Gino show's up for the final showdown. Eastwood doesn't do anything but let him self blown away. Why did he do that? Doesn't he have nothing to live for anymore? This movie is long, boring, stupid and a true disappointment. I didn't pay to see a racism Drama where my hero Clint Eastwood is a racist trough whole movie and than he gets blown away at the end of the movie. This is an overrated movie not even Where Eagles Dare is so overrated even Dirty Harry is not overrated. This is so far one the worst movies of Eastwood I ever saw and a true disappointment to a fan like me.",1,4,13,11 January 2015
X-Men: Apocalypse," X-Men Apocalypse sucks ass the worst horrible awful stinker X-Men movie ever
","*MAJOR SPOILERS* X-Men: Apocalypse is the worst apocalyptic STINKER movie ever, it is over long, over boring I hate this movie! This movie has no solid acting at all and this new X-Men movie really sucks ass! They made the film in the year 1983 the year I was born. This movie is not the year 1983, it was terrible digital filmed and it was terrible horrible shot and the timeline was set in this year 2016 and that was last year! I really didn't had a desire to write a review for this peace of s**t movie because I was really disappointed the last 3 movies really sucks they are really horrible movies.Bryan Singer has really no clue about making any good movies anymore, he screwed up Superman Returns and he screwed up this movie. Days of Future Past did end solid but the movie was still over long over boring and it sucked. I did liked First Class I thought was okay but this movie is the worst X-Men ever.STOP making sequels after sequels, remakes after remakes, reboots after reboots and prequels after prequels! This movie timeline was hell no in 1983 stop making the prequels already you stupid dick Singer! I am tired of prequels already. First Class had a prequel but it screwed up Professor Charles Xavier and Raven/Mystique from the first two movies because these two characters were never step sister and brother they were enemies in the first three movies gosh! Superman III was made that year 1983 and was set in that time in the 1983 my year I was born! Superman III was MILES hell better than X-Men Apocalypse this peace of s**t prequel movie! F**k this! Superman III get's 4.9 on IMDb score while this movie get's 7.1 are people that stupid?! Audience brainwashed by Critic's Ratings Sophie Turner do me the biggest favor and stop trying to be Jean Grey just stay in Game of Thrones please! Jennifer Lawrence sucks she sucks as Raven I want Rebecca Romijn back she was MILES better actress and a totally bad-ass the villain unlike Jennifer Lawrence and her shi*** character gosh. I am tired of her.Magneto (Michael Fassbender) please die already just die. So suddenly Magneto has a family and they are killed and he goes on a rampage haven't we see that one before in the first three movies? Jezus Christ! Yeah, forgiving Magneto like it's nothing after he helps to kill millions of people and destroy entire cities is included in the package. Also, he changes his mind about the whole 'destroy the world' thing after Mystique tells him for the 100th time that he is her family and she still sees good in him. Disgrace!! Terrible script, terrible writing, poorly paced, useless f****** movie. I hate the timeline why 1983 why just why! Why the year I was born why? I hate this movie to death! I hate it, I hate it!!! I hate that Singer keeps doing that it is not logical! The main villain's motivation is bland and stupid. (Yeah, he just wants to kill everyone and rule the world.) The way he 'persuades' other mutants to join him is absolutely unbelievable - he basically just offers to increase a mutant's power and in return demands help to kill billions of people.special effect and CGI are dumb and awfully look pretty stupid! Apocalypse is the worst boring none logical stupid villain in this movie. Enigmatic Apocalypse, 'played' by Oscar Isaac is a giant moron of nothing, a very good actor covered up in tons of makeup to the point of anonymity, and given a motivation that should make sense but is actually less clear. James McAvoy retire his character sucks dick in this movie! the Four Horseman was lame and terrible this mutants in here sucks they suck ass! OK! the action scenes were lame (when there were action scenes)...and I don't care one bit about Fassbender or the new Xavier. Those actors do Absolutely Nothing for me.Apocalypse did look stupid and his voice was funny too and yes he was not the way how it was in comic books. Rose Byrne was not needed here!Another thing I forgot to mention: Nightcrawler was definitely not in in the prequel why? Watch X-Men 2 and you will see the picture. Jean Grey and Storm met Nightcrawler in X-Men 2 after that sequel that character was never mentioned before. But suddenly he appears as X-Men and he becomes a team member stupid! I am tired of Cyclops Jesus! X2: X-MEN UNITED WAS BETTER THAN X-MEN APOCALYPSE I rather watch that movie! X-Men the first movie was Miles way better than X-Men Apocalypse! X-Men: The Last Stand was WAY better than X-Men Apocalypse it ended solid and I loved Wolverine he is not in here at all!!! X-Men the 90s animated series and comics were always better than those god awful films. Apocalypse in the cartoon was more scarier and intimidating than in this. CAPTAIN America CIVIL WAR WAS BETTER THAN X-MEN APOCALYPSE, therefore I look forward to seeing many more Avengers films. Avengers Age of Ultron and Ant-Man were better than X-Men Apocalypse hands down.This movie was a failure score F 1/10 from now on I am staying away from X-Men movies. When new X-Men movies come out I am staying away.",1,3,7,9 May 2017
Back to the Future Part III," Underrated and unappreciated third sequel an epic time travel adventure
","Underrated doesn't deserve the hate. Back to the Future Part III is so unappreciated. I keep hearing from people how bad this film is. Am I the only one who enjoyed this film? It is not a masterpiece like the first one is but it is a tied with the first one and it is a great sequel a great end to an excellent trilogy. Back to the Future is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I love the first film to death and it is a masterpiece and I love this (the third film) to death. Back to the Future Part III in my opinion it is tied with the first one and it is one of the best sequels of all time. It is my second favorite film in the trilogy in my opinion it is better than Part II I have enjoyed it more than Part II.Michael J. Fox , Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenburgen are excellent at acting I have enjoyed their performances. Robert Zemeckis writes and directs excellent this sequel. Alan Silvestri writes a beautiful score for third film which it was shot back to back with the second film. I Love the new score for this movie. Back to the Future Part III (1990)I love that this film was set in the Old West back in 1885. I love the rescue mission in which Marty goes back in time from the year 1955 back in to the past in to the Old West to save his best friend Doc Brown from getting killed by an outlaw Buford Tannen. I love western movies and Marty McFly was naming him self as Clint Eastwood in this film which it was brilliant. They even make similarity from A Fistful of Dollars (one of my all time favorite western films) in which Marty wears a boiler plate as a bullet proof vest in which Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) shoots Marty. This movie has comedy, adventure, action, bank robbery, train robbery, gun fights, fist fights and one explosion. Great acting from the actors, great direction and great writing, great score. This movie shows group of Indians, followed closely by Cavalry men who are chasing them. Doc saves Marty just before he would be hang by Buford and his men. I did like that the film was more focusing on Doc and Marty the characters that we care about. Rather then Loraine and Biff like Part II did. The movie wasn't dark like the second was. I love how Doc and Marty pushes the DeLorean along the spur line, on the tracks attempting to get it up to 88 miles per hour. DeLorean then reaches 88mph and disappears...with the locomotive barreling over the side of the ravine, and exploding in a huge fireball, brilliant and well done special effect. I love that the movie does not messes with the first two movies and it is an original film I appreciate that. It is Rated PG for language, sensuality and violence. It is a perfect film from the 90's that I have grew up with it. It is my second favorite film in the trilogy I love, love this film to death and doesn't deserve the hate. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval a perfect score for me.",10,124,133,2 March 2018
Transformers," The first and the only best!
","Transformers (2007) is the only best one science fiction action film of the last three movies that I enjoy. Okay it is not the greatest or the best science fiction film but it is still a good one. It's the only, only movie I watch several times. Transformers 2 I watch three times in a row so far and that movie made me exhausted, Transformers 3 I watch it twice. Once on the computer and once on the DVD I rent it in the Library. I have the third movie on DVD till today I haven't watch that DVD and I think I give 13£ for it.I have enjoyed this movie much better than the last three. In Transformers I loved the car chases with Sam, how the story began, than the war and the chase for the glasses All Spark. I love it. I love actor Jon Voight. Now I know why he did not return in the sequels. The movie was really awesome and I can't say anything bad about it. It had a great plot great action and great excitement.This movie is great out of the four, which I think Age of Extinction is the worst one so far, over too long. Shia does an amazing job, the soundtrack is awesome and the special effects/sounds are 'out of this world.' I REALLY Love Transformers! A big fan of the original cartoon I grew up with the cartoon's as a kid. Could it only disappoint? Especially after all those less than OK 'second generations' of the Transformers tale, and seeing that everyone's favorite Bumblebee character was no longer a VW bug, but a Camaro? Well, it was fantastic! It was great to see some of the characters adapt and come to life in this version, and the movie provides great action, really good humor and plenty of realistic effects for anyone, not just fans of the old collectibles. But it can only be even more exciting for fans when they are finally re-introduced to Megatron, Optimus, Jazz and more. The film does a great job of creating the feeling of helplessness for humans, which would only make sense against technology like the Transformers. I couldn't help buy find my hands continuously gripping the arm rests tighter, and that was during my second watch! Minus a few cheesy scenarios or brief moments that seem to creep into many an action movie.The Music score by Steve Jablonsky was awesome, I love all the music soundtracks in the film. Transformers is Michael Bay's first attempt of making of a Transformer movie and it succeeds. I saw this film and I was blown away, not only by the story, but how good the CGI of those robots were, these robots were looking like they were walking downtown In Los Angeles, they didn't look like CGI at all. They looked like realistic robots and that was great okay. For a movie that was under $2,000,000 that is right this film cost $150.000.000 and the robots looks that sweet, it was just great okay. The best thing about this film is not Michael bay heavy, you know what that means? It means there is no stupid and I mean stupid dialogues spoken trough the whole movie, the dialogues that was spoke trough whole this movie smart and somewhat funny in most parts funny mainly, it wasn't too over the top were feels like is not funny, that is stupid. Action in this movie is good, the movie is well paced at 2 Hrs. 24 Mins. is not the longest one that was the fourth one. Made was by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures, they a lot and I mean a lot of Disney channel stars in in this film you got a Arwin (Brian Stepanek) from The Suite Life of Zack and Cody and that fat blonde boy that was talking about Armageddon. I think that was a joke that Michael Bay put on him self, this is hundred times better than Armageddon, and I was you mean Aramgeddon the film or the joke, because that was good poke, because Armageddon was awful, that was great I like that part. The mythology that was made for director Michael Bay. This is the beginning of the trilogy that tells the story of the long, galactic feud between the Autobots and their nemesis, the Decepticons. As a child of the '80's, how could you not love Transformers? I love it. I love the science action mythology flick of the first film, which did great. The interstellar battle between the Autobots and Decepticons rains destruction down on planet Earth as director Michael Bay adapts Hasbro and Takara's popular Transformers franchise into a big-budget, live-action summer tent-pole extravaganza in this ambitious sci-fi action feature starring Shia LaBeouf, Tyrese Gibson, Bernie Mac, John Turturro, Jon Voight, and, of course, Optimus Prime and Megatron. Enormous aliens have chosen the third rock from the sun as their ultimate battleground, and as the villainous Decepticons struggle to obtain the key to unlimited power, a young Earthling named Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) may stand as mankind's last hope for survival.I am giving it a 10/10 It is not the greatest movie or the best one but it is a good entertaining film. Transformers is a 2007 American science fiction action film based on the Transformers toy line. The film, which combines computer animation with live-action, is directed by Michael Bay, with Steven Spielberg serving as executive producer. 10/10 Score: A Studio: DreamWorks Pictures, Paramount Pictures Starring: Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Rachel Taylor, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro, Jon Voight, Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving Director: Michael Bay Producers: Don Murphy, Tom DeSanto, Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Ian Bryce, Steven Spielberg Screenplay: Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman Story by John Rogers, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 24 Mins.

Million Dollar Baby," A true sports drama masterpiece!
","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a sports boxing real human life portrayed Drama, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off. Million Dollar Baby (2004) is Clint Eastwood's true masterpiece and one of his best movies and touching performances I have ever seen. This movie is million miles way better than the new movie Creed (2015)!! Creed (2015) hides from this movie! Clint Eastwood plays Dunn and directs, produces and composes music for this acclaimed, multiaward-winning tale of heart, hope and family. This is the real sports boxing drama portrayed about human young woman's life been a boxer. A lot of people disagree with me for not liking Gran Torino Clint Eastwood's overrated movie and does not accept that I love this movie. Beside Rocky and Southpaw is my third favorite best sports drama boxing movie. I just love this movie to death, I love it so much. This film is touching, powerful, incredible movie with amazing, amazing performances from Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank. Clint Eastwood sure did a great well excellent direction on this movie. This is my favorite best Clint Eastwood movie and no one can tell me not liking it, like Gran Torino that movie is better, in my opinion is not. Million Dollar Baby is the best human boxing drama life portrayed in a film ever! Million Dollar Baby is about an under-appreciated boxing trainer, the mistakes that haunt him from his past, and his quest for atonement by helping an underdog amateur boxer achieve her dream of becoming a professional. This movie isn't just about fighting and boxing matches it is about a bond, friendship and true love for sport. The chemistry between Clint and Hilary was awesome and masterful done, they both make a connection bond between father and daughter. Maggie Fitzgerald never had a father, while Frankie Dunn never had a daughter before. The underdog tale about young girl's life ids astonish telling, but the film isn't only about her. It is a about grief Frankie did a big mistake in the past and he does not want to repeat again. Morgan Freeman did awesome performance as retired boxer Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris, Dunn's gym assistant. Great story with good action and well mix of emotion. One of the best movies but saddest movies I've ever seen I love boxing there's a few boring bits but overall great movie well done. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman & Hilary Swank provide a storyline much deeper than simply the world of women's boxing. Another Directing delight from Clint Eastwood !! What more can I say? Just amazing. Humor, photography, acting - all exemplary. The music was rather repetitive though. It holds up well over the years. Loved the way the relationships were drawn. I think Million Dollar Baby is the Best Movie in the world I think this Movie is for the older crowd Awesome movie by the Way. Another score for Hilary Swank (best actress for the second time)! Excellent movie all the way around, superb acting from all the cast. If you haven't seen it and think it's just a 'boxing' movie then you're really missing out. it's much more about the characters and their relationships, past and present. Very powerful movie. Highly recommended! Hilary Swank did the best job in the world playing Margaret 'Maggie' Fitzgerald, a determined, aspiring boxer, I seriously love the actress. She was my first true crush love since I saw her in a TV movie Dying to Belong (1997) wen she was so damn sexy and hot and her previous movie The Next Karate Kid (1994). This is dramatic filmmaking at its finest. Eastwood paints a realistic, down-to-earth dramatic picture with this film. The trio of stars (including Eastwood himself) gives the performances of their careers - no one is overacting or winking at the camera. The most what I love is how we find more about Maggie's life. What I never saw in any movie beside Rocky what can happen to a boxer if he get's permanently damaged. The fights in this movie are realistic in the last fight when Maggie gets a deadly shot by her opponent in her blind side and lands on her head on the corner stool, breaking her neck and than suffers spinal neck injury that leaves her paralyzed for life. That was real, everything is real! I never saw that you can get paralyzed from fighting for life! The last 1/4 of the movie is about euthanasia and human morals. Maggie is bedridden for a long time and eventually has to have her leg amputated due to bed sores turning gangrenous. That scene really remind on my mother when she was lining in the hospital and the doctors amputated her leg. I love how Maggie stick up for her self once in her life when her mother and her sister tried to ripped her off and squeeze her out off her money. All her family was ever caring was just money not their daughter/sister's health and life. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth. Million Dollar Baby is a 2004 American sports drama film directed, co-produced and scored by Clint Eastwood, and starring Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Warner Bros.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Excellent action - horror sequel in the Resident Evil franchise almost good as the original Apocalypse kicks ass
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) is an excellent sequel that follows the roots to the first film. This one and the first one are the best films in the franchise, it is not so good as the first one but it is close. I love this film to death and it is the last good film that I love. This time Resident Evil is directed by Alexander Witt and this was his first film he directed and his only film he ever directed. He works more on Camera and Electrical Department before he went and directed this movie. I can say Alexander Witt was awesome, he knew what was he doing and he did a really excellent job directing this movie and he directed perfectly. Milla Jovovich did return as fierce Alice and she is fabulous as always and Paul W.S. Anderson also returned as writer and producer. We have now a new cast Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr and no one returns from the first movie. Apocalypse I love as a guilty pleasure because there were some things I did like about it: The girl who played Jill (Sienna Guillory) was pretty good with what she had to do. Oded Fehr as Carlos was awesome probably the biggest bad ass in the film series. Also the zombies in the city were cool because it reminded me of Resident evil 2.Plot: Alice (Milla Jovovich), who struggles to find out what the Umbrella corporation has done to her as she leads survivors in an escape from a Raccoon City infested with the dead. Directed by Alexander Witt, the film features several characters from the video game series including Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), Nicholai Ginovaeff (Zack Ward), and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr).After narrowly escaping the horrors of the underground Hive facility, Alice (Milla Jovovich) is quickly thrust back into a war raging above ground between the living and the Undead. As the city is locked down under quarantine, Alice joins a small band of elite soldiers, led by Valentine (Sienna Guillory, Love, Actually) and Carlos (Oded Fehr, The Mummy Returns), enlisted to rescue the missing daughter of Dr. Ashford, the creator of the mutating T-virus. Its a heart-pounding race against time as the group faces off against hordes of blood- thirsty zombies, stealthy Lickers, mutant canines and the most sinister foe yet. Written and produced by the visionary director of Resident Evil, Paul W. S. Anderson (Alien Vs. Predator) and directed by Alexander Witt, Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a superior sci-fi suspense sequel.All three Resident Evils are wonderful pieces of work. They aren't just like every other zombie movie, they really have plots. And they are really suspenseful and just plain awesome. Rocket launchers, guns, zombies, villains trying to destroy the world. This movie rocks so much its not funny the action is just perfect not to gory not to weak its a perfect movie, this film is a great zombie film with exceptional graphics and fight scenes. There isn't many trilogy's that can say they didn't become over rated and less entertaining as time went on, this trilogy and film is amazing.Resident Evil is a thrill ride with some really intense action. Fans of the game should like the costuming work done with Jill and how the monster makeup made the Nemesis look just like he does in the game. It had some of the best action I've seen in a long time.The most in this film that I love is the dark scenes, the film is filmed at night, which I love that. I love the action in the church when Jill Valentine and a group of survivors are fighting those giant zombie monsters and Alice jumps with a motorcycle trough the window and she drove's right in front of zombie monster, jumps off the motorcycle makes a back flip from off of the motorcycle and landed, posted up and pulled out her guns and blew the zombie and the motorcycle up! If that isn't a bad ass or what. I don't know what to tell you. Alice raises her dual two-tone Heckler & Koch MP5Ks and fires them on a zombie monster.I love that this film is a rescue mission on a little girl Angie Ashford (Sophie Vavasseur) which Alice with Jill and Carols is coming to school to rescue her and escape from Raccoon City before it is destroyed by a nuclear missile.Overall: I love this film to death, It is almost as good as the first one, just the original will always be the best one! 10 out of 10 this excellent action horror sequel gets, I had a lot of fun and a blast watching this film. I love the bad ass song The End of Heartache by Killswitch Engage and Vermillion by Slipknot those two movies kicks ass.Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a 2004 apocalyptic fiction action horror film directed by Alexander Witt, from a screenplay written by producer Paul W. S. Anderson. It is the second installment in the Resident Evil film series, which is based on the Capcom survival horror video game series Resident Evil.10/10 Score: A Studio: Constantin Film, Davis Films, Impact Pictures Starring: Milla Jovovich, Sienna Guillory, Oded Fehr, Thomas Kretschmann, Jared Harris, Mike Epps, Sophie Vavasseur, Iain Glen, Matthew G.

Guardians of the Galaxy," It is a perfect Best Marvel comic book Movie Ever!
","Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) is the best MARVEL comic book film ever! I really enjoyed this film a lot. So this is not like any Marvel film we have seen. It's incredible. The visuals in this film are literally out of this world. The comedy is spot on and Chris Pratt is hilarious! Nothing like it. Ever. I'm positive I'm going to see this movie again. This Movie was THE BEST!!!. & yea Bradley Cooper as Rocket Racoon Stole THE DAMN SHOW WHICH WAS AWESOME!!!. Glad they announced A Sequel for 2017 which is exciting!!!. No matter how good The Movie was almost every Good Movie that I saw this Year no matter what nothing more will beat The Amazing Spider-Man 2 This Year in My Opinion!!!. This movie is 1,000,000 times better than the new turtles and Avengers: Age of Ultron movie! This is how you make a movie, this is what I am talking about! This movie with Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) kicks the out of Avengers 2015 ass. This film is the best I have ever seen!!! I really enjoyed Guardians, it reminds me of the kind of blockbusters I loved as a kid. It is epic, colorful, fast paced, and most of all fun! The colors in the movie are so vibrant, the film really lends itself to showing off that fact.Guardians of the Galaxy it's an outstanding fun, blockbuster film! The music is good, I hardly thought about it. Rocket is my favorite character.I loved this film it was just a blast to see in the theater.

It is not boring or too long it has funny, moments, action and a good plot and a wonderful story.This days there are no original movies anymore and the only point you want to be engage into the movie is the emotion and the feel for the character development which is hard to accomplished now a days because of CGI.

Jurassic World," A time waster mediocre overrated boring cheap crap, the worst Jurassic Park movie ever!
","Jurassic World (2015) is a time waster! This movie sucks ass!! Boring lame, overrated mediocre crap and copycat of the first film Jurassic Park (1993), Renny Harlin's Underrated action horror flick Deep Blue Sea (1999) and Schwarzenegger's Predator (1987)! I hate this movie and it is terrible just like Star Wars: The Force Awakens this movie is so boring and forgettable, I have quit watching this movie after one hour. I had never such a bad experience with a movie! I will never watch it again. I hate this movie and it is the worst film from 2015 alongside Star Wars Force Awakens they both suck!!!! I am one of the biggest fans of the first film Jurassic Park (1993), I grew up watching that movie, I saw the trailer on TV as a kid and I grew up watching the first movie. I still do have dinosaurs action figures back at home from Jurassic Park, I think I even had a t-shirt or a sweater as a kid written Jurassic Park on it, I was looking for that sweater today and I can't find it anywhere. I love the second one The Lost World: Jurassic Park with Ian Malcolm, you come to the third one and you know what I will take the third movie over Jurassic World. Just like a pure fun popcorn, Action Film I will take that one. They brought Sam Neill back as Dr. Alan Grant. The third entry was a rescue mission, it was fast paced and it went quick time around. I still love The Lost World: Jurassic Park equal as the first flick Jurassic Park, but the third flick grow on me and I love it and I have changed my mind. I love the third flick I love it to death. I will rather watch that flick than this forgettable film Jurassic World! I went to theater seen this awful trash movie, first time I seen it, I thought it was the best one, but that was because I haven't seen the original trilogy for 14. years, but re watching the trilogy on Blu-ray, I really had a blast watching them and all where better than this film. Recently watching this film on Blu-ray, I was extremely disappointed and bored out of my mind. I couldn't finish it the second time around. I wish I could get my money back for the ticket and the Blu-ray disc I have bought recently. Character development is terrible and absolutely forgettable.Jurassic World copy's the first Jurassic Park.Two kids come on the island to the new park to see her aunt, duh we already saw that in the first one. The older brother is a big douchebag to his younger brother, he only cared was about seeing chicks, what an asshole! Bryce Dallas Howard's character is a bitch! She didn't care about the two kids, until same accident happens, just like was in the first movie.Jurassic World copied Deep Blue Sea (1999).T-Rex was faster and smarter hunter and he tricked people believing he escaped off the fence, but actually he was hunting them, they make, the T-Rex smarter hunter! I already saw that in Deep Blue Sea, when doctors implant the human brains in the sharks. In here they did the same thing with the T-Rex! Jurassic World copied Arnold Schwarzenegger's Predator! 'She's killing for sport.' - Owen Grady - we already hear that in Predator 1 & 2.The kids jumps in the water fall escaping the T-Rex, I already saw that in Predator, Arnold jumped off the waterfall! The movie is absolutely terrible shot, I am not meaning directed, but digitally shot with camera, was absolutely terrible guys. The picture was lousy shot.The CGI was incredible fake, Chris Pratt with a motorcycle on a fake CGI with raptors was terrible.Chris Pratt was awful, his character was incredible dull written! Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) was fantastic film with Chris Pratt in it, much better film than Jurassic World and when I made a review for that movie 4 assholes put down my review! If you like this movie it is alright I really don't have problem with that, I am just not going to agree with you, that's all.Another flaw I don't like in the film is: those kids find a Jurassic Park jeep and it is been there since 1993 and 16. year old kid start the jeep in less than 30 seconds, how the hell did he do that? duh. That is impossible for a human been, to do that, come on.Raptors are now dogs and you can train them to be your best friend? Say What? That is stupid! They killed Brachiosaurus in this film, I almost cried seeing an animal dying in this movie. None of the movies in the original trilogy did that, not even in Jurassic Park III they did that!This movie should kneel and suck on Deep Blue Sea's dick, since it stole a lot of things from It.Deep Blue Sea, Deep Rising and The Relic for me, in my opinion, all of them are better movies than this Overrated Trash.And yes, I have enjoyed Jurassic Park III Miles ways better, than I did this fake film, rating for me is 1/10.",1,8,14,7 May 2016
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers: Age of Ultron is a damn good Superhero flick, excellent sequel!
","Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is a MARVEL damn good superhero flick and an excellent sequel! Yes it is miles way better than Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Terminator Genisys I have enjoyed this film much better than Jurassic World, Star Wars and Terminator the new movies. This film is fun, popcorn, Action and entertaining action sequel flick. I like the first one but I love this one much more. The first time I watch it, I did not like this film at all, it did not work for me, but the second time around this flick was awesome and it become one of my favorite MARVEL superhero movies. I love this film so much, more than the first Avengers. James Spader made the movie for me! So much better than Loki. 
James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. played together in a teen movie Tuff Turf in 1985 and 30 years later they teamed together to star in a MARVEL comic book super hero film. I like Tuff Turf but Avengers: Age of Ultron is far way better film to me. I love this film so much and I will never get the backlash. Joss Whedon gave me everything I wanted in a sequel. This and the first film are in my top 10 films of all time. I waited a long time for this universe and I am loving every minute of it. Superhero movies come out all time but something like this is what I love about movies. 
Plot: Tony Stark creates the Ultron Program to protect the world, but when the peace-keeping program becomes hostile, The Avengers go into action to try and defeat a virtually impossible enemy's to get. Earth's mightiest heroes must come together once again to protect the world from global extinction. I really enjoy this movie I don't get the backslash and a lot of people were disappointed with this sequel that it is not so good as the first film. Age of Ultron is in my top 3 favorite comic book films. Number 1 will always be Captain America: The Winter Soldier and number 2 will be Captain America: The First Avenger, I just love those two films: Captain America is my favorite superhero character in MARVEL comic books. Captain America in this movie is the most decent hero in this movie, he did not want the leave the island with people stuck on it, he refused too, I have seen a hero in him. People are keep getting upset over Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), 'oh look what they did with Black Widow.' I saw the film and I am seeing her kicking ass or calm down the Hulk, which is a pretty ballsy thing to do. Specially for someone who has no balls and she is kicking ass and driving motorcycle, driving around shooting for Cap, helping them to get vision android to beat Ultron and she is the only one with no powers, except Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), she has the to get the thing for them. I think it would be weird to kidnapped Thor, if you put Thor in the scene duh. I enjoy this movie much more than the first film, the first film I liked okay, I like the first Avengers film. This is a fun popcorn entertainment flick that I really love. 
I like the romance between Black Widow with Hulk it was really good fast paced entertainment. I love Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch I like the twist by the end of the film that she turn her side around when she found out that Ultron wants to destroy everything on this planet I love that. You have Aaron Taylor-Johnson in it from Kick-Ass film as Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver sadly he dies on the end of the film, but he saves Hawkeye and a kid from Ultron firing bunch of bullets on them I thought that was pretty decent in the film. In my opinion Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a good job playing his character. I love that they return Samuel L. Jackson to the movie back as Nick Fury and that he help them out fighting Ultron. James Spader did a terrific excellent job playing Ultron.Avengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and the eleventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). You have a lot of action in it, I also love that Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton work together after Ultron failed to destroy them and they go in to safe house to Clinton's family, I like that. When Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) touches Black Widow, Iron Man and Thor I like that you see a background of Natasha Romanoff's childhood, I like that. I love the African shipyard you see them on a ship and I love the last stand. I love that the Vision helps Avengers to destroy and stop Ultron from extinction. Btw I love to death Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) she is so beautiful and charming I love her.
Overall: I am giving this flick 10 out of 10 for me Age of Ultron is my #3 favorite super hero movie. I can't wait for the next movie: Captain America: Civil War.",10,128,197,8 May 2016
The Dark Knight," The best epic Science Fiction/Action film, The Dark Knight is Nolan's masterpiece.
","The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gylenhaal and Morgan Freeman.The dark Knight (2008) is the best epic Science Fiction/Action Batman film today. A truly great Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, straight from the comic books.The film lives up to Batman and Batman Forever.Capturing scarecrow was awesome. The Fight sequences were so much better than in Batman Begins. This film has a Heart and everything that stands for this film. The Dark Knight is actually a symbol for hope. Batman doesn't kill people in here, that isn't for what Batman stands for. He only scares people that is it.When you watch The Dark Knight you have to put your brain in to it, to understand the movie and that is what I did.I love The Dark Knight in the Tomb bat mobile when blow something he wrote only scare so he does not kill people. Best Batman Line: 'I'm not wearing hockey pads!' Terrific cast and awesome directors. Is the Batman movie I ever wanted! This film makes correct mistake that Batman Forever failed. The Dark Knight is a reboot of Batman Forever. It fix Batman Forever were that movie failed. Were Joel Schumacher failed with his Batman movies.I Still can't believe Batman Forever won 3.Oscars while The Dark Knight won only 2.Oscars ugh.But The Dark Knight and Batman Begins are the best movies made by comic books. The Dark Knight is much better because there is more Batman in it. By day he is Bruce Wayne by night he is Batman. There are more fighting sequences flying sequences he was in Hong Kong really fantastic. Joker was portrayed by Heath Ledger really awesome. Bruce Wayne was on his wonderful bike and then he was in his beautiful car. The Dark Knight beats the hell out of Batman Forever. The Dark Knight starts, they finally shows that Batman did catch Crane it was wonderful when he jumped on the van and he took Scarecrow's mask off. Crane did come back for 5.minutes but he was still awesome. Now after Batman won and he beat Ra's Al Ghul by trying to destroy Gotham City and stopping crime boss Falcone, this time in The Dark Knight, Batman must take on the Joker and the mob who hired Joker to kill the Batman. Batman Forever was Schumacher fiction the only thing Schumacher did right, was scene were Maroni scared Harvey Dent in the court room, that was the only right scene. It fix Batman Forever I forgot to mentioned they change the car in Batman Forever in The Dark Knight they destroyed the tomb but they change into a bike vehicle and Batman driving trough the mall with a bike was a fantastic Action sequence! Also Nolan's inspiration for the film was the Joker's comic book debut The Killing Joke, and the series The Long Halloween, which retold Two-Face's origin. The nickname 'the Dark Knight' was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.It was Heath Ledger's brilliant performance as The Joker that made The Dark Knight a masterpiece. Heath Ledger's acting the Joker was believable, he was absolutely ,awesomely, amazing ,brilliant and fantastic. I never saw anyone or any actor playing a character like that, like Heath did. Not only Heath Ledger was in his best performance also Aaron Eckhart correct and performed Harvey Dent/Two-Face better than Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever, Action stunts were wonderful, Maggie Gyllenhaal was absolutely fantastic as Rachel Dawes better than Katie Holmes was. Maggie did also much wonderful better performance than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. I am glad they cast Maggie in it, instead of shallow stupid dumb Katie Holmes.Aaron Eckhart was awesome great fantastic as Harvey Dent he was portrayed by comic books. Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever (1995) was purple, his design was half black, half purple, he wasn't portrayed right. Hollywood wanted that sequel to Batman Returns ugh.Harvey Dent wasn't a sidekick to Riddler he didn't even met him or become his partner, he didn't had two women's beside him. He was alone and he went on a revenge killing spree for Rachel Dawson 's death. Harvey Dents says We Kill the Bat or was the Riddler in this film is saying the Joker this lines. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Detective Jim Gordon. Whole cast in the film was wonderful and absolutely fantastic. It is really tragic that Heath Ledger that year died before the premiere. I heard a lot about fans crying over theï»¿ actor's death that year. Finally Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman was good in his role which I like him much better in here than I did in Batman Begins.The film was released on 14 July 2008 (New York City, New York (premiere) in USA. The film also Features 37 minutes of IMAX footage, which Christopher Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras to film some sequences, including the Joker's first appearance in the film. CGI and special Effects are also awesome and aren't bad. Costume designer Lindy Hemming was awesome as she worked on the Batman, Harvey Dent and Joker costumes. The Dark Knight is the best Batman Epic Science Fiction Action film ever! It is beyond Amazing and I love this film to death!The Dark Knight score: A + .

The Mummy Returns," A great underrated sequel in the Mummy action genre franchise!
","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a few action fantasy sequels, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.The Mummy Returns (2001) was my second movie during summer 2001 in the mummy series franchise that I went to see it in the movie theater that year. This time I went alone during the summer watching this movie. This flick become one of my favorite action adventure movies. It is my favorite Mummy flick and I don't care what anyone says I love it! I bought VHS tape in 2003, unfortunately I don't have that tape anymore, but I got it on Blu-ray disc and I love it so much. The year's biggest action-adventure is coming home with a vengeance! Brendan Fraser and an all-star cast reunite with Stephen Sommers for explosive, non-stop thrills in 'the ultimate roller-coaster movie ride!' Brendan Fraser ,Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Patricia Velasquez and Oded Fehr returns from the first movie and reunite for the second time of the Mummy franchise with some new additions on the cast Freddie Boath and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. It's as good as the first film in the aspect of special effects, but it is just as entertaining and comical as the first film. I love the first film and I love this film, the story is brilliant and the actors give brilliant performances. But like I said some of the special effects are terrible like the first appearance of the animated Scorpion King, he just looks really bad. Apart from that The Mummy Returns is an hilarious and highly entertaining film. A must for fans of the franchise! A lot of the critics were unkind to this movie but they were missing the point: it's just fun all the way﻿. They only dropped the ball on the CG scorpion king in my opinion. Brilliant movies﻿. I felt my soul freaking escape when I heard Arnold speak Imhotep was my favorite character and still is! What I love about this movie: The Mummy and The Mummy Returns reminds me on The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Both of the movie did had returning cast and they ere both much different dark tone, characters. I think The Mummy Returns copied or borrowed scenes from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This film is set 10 years after the vents on the first movie an ancient legacy of terror is unleashed when the accursed mummy, Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), is resurrected - along with a force even more powerful: The Scorpion King (The Rock). Now, as the fate of all mankind hangs in the balance, Rick O'Connell (Fraser) and his wife Evie (Rachel Weisz) embark on a daring, desperate race to save their son - and the world - from unspeakable evil. I have enjoyed this movie in every way and I love that movie isn't boring but has action and it is set in different locations beside the Egypt. It has action, humor and great performances by the actors in it. In my opinion I think The Mummy is superior and much better than this movie, but this sequel isn't bad either and it is a good summer blockbuster movie. I always enjoy even today when every time I see it. The acting is pretty good, though sometimes things become a little hammy. The writing and directing are also well done, this is like the mini-version of what Indiana Jones could be -- though that may be too big a compliment. The flaws and the problems I have with the film are: the CGI were messed up this time around; it did not meet up with those from the first film! Some characters were in a dark tone this time. The character Evie Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) was really in a dark tone and way, way too hot I really did not like that in the movie. Not that I did not like it, in the movie the past life of Evelyn really confused me, when she was Princess Nefertiri a princess warrior when Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velásquez) killed her father the emperor. Suddenly Evie was a bad ass! Just like Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from The Terminator from a shy girl to a bad ass in sequel. That is why I am saying this movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The special-effects are TERRIBLE! The Scorpion King looks so fake! The army of Anubis looks fake! Everything that had to be inserted digitally comes out terrible. That is the main problems in the film that I had. The last ting I wanna say: when the full force of Anubis' army is bearing down and outnumbered, the Medjai prepare to make their last stand everyone in the theater was cheering up with them when Ardeth Bay screams his line: 'Till Death! Everyone was cheering up for them. As everything was said, I love this movie and everyone did a great job and I love this movie to death! I gave a 9/10 if they wouldn't be any flaws in it or weren't things that bothered me in it. The Mummy Returns is a 2001 American action adventure film written and directed by Stephen Sommers, starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr, Patricia Velásquez, and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.

The Fly," A horror masterpiece my favorite one David Cronenberg best movie
","My all time favorite horror film and everyone who watch it and like it knew it is a true David Cronenberg masterpiece and of course his best film! It is a stylish science-fiction horror film based on George Langelaan's 1957 short story of the same name. The film tells of an eccentric scientist who, after one of his experiments goes wrong, slowly turns into a fly-hybrid creature. My all time favorite creature horror film I have this movie in my video Blu-ray collection and I love 80's horror films to death.Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is a scientist working on a project which is a teleportation device that can teleport molecular structures until one day he experiments on himself with it accidentally lending a Fly into the machine with him being fused. He seems normal after that but days later he is changing and even his sexy journalist girlfriend (Geena Davis) even starts to notice his weird changes he grows through each day like if he's decaying and that he will soon become a monster.Powerful and horrifying remake of the 1958 Vincient Price Science Fiction horror classic! Canadian Sci-fi/horror/thriller mastermind David Croenberg sets up another masterpiece much like 'Eastern Promises', 'Videodrome', 'Naked Lunch', 'Scanners', 'The Brood' or even 'A History of Violence' for proving he's a genius on all levels. This one nearly tops the original in some ways using state of the art special effects and gore from Chris Walas ('Gremlins' and 'Scanners') which are quite disgusting to this day like the stomach churning dough nut scene. The performances are just flawless and the film also has emotional which makes this a great Sci-fi horror movie with pure though and disturbing images, this one isn't for weak stomaches but it is a brilliant movie that goes into our deepest fears and mind. A winner all the way! Score A+ 10/10 really recommend you to see this movie you want be disappointed you will be thrilled like I was.The Fly is a 1986 American science-fiction horror film directed and co-written by David Cronenberg.

National Treasure," Nicolas Cage's best solid bad ass action adventure flick!
","National Treasure (2004) is Nicolas Cage's best solid performance for an outstanding role of his character Benjamin Franklin Gates! This movie become very popular in 2004 and it got a sequel. I am still waiting for third sequel but I doubt there will National Treasure 3. This is also the best one of the two films in the franchise. The adventure and action in this movie is perfect executed. This film is about a treasure hunt that whole life Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage) was hunting, now a team of mercenary's who betrayed Gates are trying to steal Declaration of Independence from museum which is the lead and final clue to a treasure hidden somewhere in the country. I love how Benjamin (Nicolas Cage) is trying to convince and warning the authorities about Ian's plans but they don't listen to him. So Benjamin and his only loyal friend Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) has to steal the Declaration of Independence so they can protect it from Ian (Sean Bean). What I love about this film is the plot, the acting, the cast, well decent character development and a good fun action. This is my third favorite Nicolas Cage film and I love it to death!Plot: Benjamin Franklin Gates descends from a family of treasure-seekers who've all hunted for the same thing: a war chest hidden by the Founding Fathers after the Revolutionary War. Ben's close to discovering its whereabouts, as is his competition, but the FBI is also hip to the hunt.That is the basic plot, it also does involves FBI chasing Benjamin and Riley beside Ian. Beautiful gorgeous sexy German actress Diane Kruger who was playing Dr. Abigail Chase did a perfect job playing her character, I haven't even noticed that she has an accent in this film. I love the music theme from Trevor Rabin for this film. This movie is awesome, It's the most thrilling treasure movie I ever seen. It keeps you excited there's humor and action. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action movie with a few laughs and adventure around it. It isn't Indiana Jones - Raiders of the Lost Ark, but a great movie along those lines none the less. I love all 4 Indiana Jones movies with Harrison Ford but I still think National Treasure is original and it is not violent or scary movie. You also have a likable cast with humor and surrounded with history around you. Jon Voight as Ben's estrange father also did a good job portraying his character Patrick Gates. Harvey Keitel was great as FBI Agent Peter Sadusky chasing Gates on his trip. The last actor I really had fun watching him was Sean Bean as the bad guy in his role as Ian Howe. I love Nicolas Cage and some of his films, but my favorite films are Con Air, The Rock and this one and National Treasure: Book of Secrets (2007). I really did enjoy this film Nicolas Cage does a wonderful acting job, it is his decent acting performance. Today Nicolas Cage wastes his talent on junk movies, just like Steven Seagal and Eddie Murphy and they don't care about there fans. I love this movie and for my self I like history, this is one movie I really did enjoy watching because this movie is about history. The facts: I don't think there is really a map on the Declaration of Independence, I think they just made that up for the entertainment. But still this is intense film, still I love that you can see a lot of history museums in this movie. I reminds me when I was last year in high school I went on class tour 2007 to visit Museums in Munich, Germany (Deutsches Museum Verkehrszentrum), it was an awesome class trip and It was the same year National Treasure 2 come out. I really miss those times. Overall: Special effects are great and thoroughly entertaining movie. This is a bad ass action adventure flick with great original story, interesting intense plot with lots of action that are all well done! This was a blind buy on Blu-ray for me and I have watched the film three times already! It is a decent solid Nicolas Cage flick MILES way better than Face/Off (1997) and other trash movies Cage is doing today! Raiting I am giving is a 10/10. National Treasure is a 2004 American adventure heist film produced and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was written by Jim Kouf, Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, and The Wibberleys, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and directed by Jon Turteltaub.

Rocky," A classic! the best and the original movie of all time - Rocky !
","Rocky (1976) It is still today one of the best action, sport, drama and a cult classic low budget films ever made in history. It is an underdog story telling about a men and his struggle in his life. Sure, I know that without it, there'd be no sequels for a ranking, but compared to III, although this Best Picture of 1976 was great, it just dragged a bit for me. I'm no brainless action-goer, mind you. I love real human drama portrayed on screen. I've got to say though, at times, you feel like you're watching a documentary on a real man's life. It's that much realistic. This to me is a no brainier. You get introduced to an insecure Rocky who works for the mob as a collector, but has too big of a heart to go around hurting people in an awesome heartfelt movie. Adrian and Rock meet, You get introduced to the lovable A-hole Pauly. Introduced to Creed. Introduced to Mick. and BUTKUS! And Rock goes the distance with Creed! This movie has a Heart . As a kid Rocky III was my favorite best movie ,but this one is my second best movie. YO ADRIAN I DID IT!!! It is my first best favorite film in the series and I just love this film to death. It has a message and it is portraying a real human drama. Rocky is a movie that everyone can relate to. One of my favorite Stallone roles, there is nobody else who could play Rocky better than him, it's too bad that he didn't win Oscar because i honestly think that he deserved it. But at least movie won the best picture of the year award. Maybe Rocky didn't win the fight in the movie, but Stallone did win his 'fight' in real life. Rocky, a poor guy that just barley manages to get by, just wants to fight. However, everyone including his trainer has given up on him. Rocky also wants to go on a date with Adrian, a very shy girl who works at the local pet store, Adrian, however, is too shy to even say anything to anyone. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed (the heavy-weight champion of boxing) learns that his boxing partner has been injured and can't fight. Apollo tries all the other potential boxing partners, but every one of them refuse. Apollo decides to give an unknown boxer a chance to fight him for the title, with the intentions of just giving him five minutes of fame then knocking him out. Apollo picks Rocky. This is the Rocky's only shot at the big time and chance he will never get it back.Rocky Balboa is a struggling boxer trying to make the big time, working as a debt collector for a pittance. When heavyweight champion Apollo Creed visits Philadelphia, his managers want to set up an exhibition match between Creed and a struggling boxer, touting the fight as a chance for a 'nobody' to become a 'somebody'. The match is supposed to be easily won by Creed, but someone forgot to tell Rocky, who sees this as his only shot at the big time. Sylvester Stallone, himself a virtual unknown, managed to sell his Rocky script (one of 35 that he'd written over the years) on the proviso that he be given the starring role. Since the film was to be made on a shoestring and marketed on a low-level basis, the risk factor to United Artists was small. For Stallone, this was a make-or-break opportunity — just like Rocky's million-to-one shot with Apollo Creed. Costing under a million dollars, Rocky managed to register with audiences everywhere, earning back 60 times its cost. The film won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture.The original Rocky film is one of the greatest epic action sport drama film in the history! It contains action, humor, romance, and an uplifting message. The screenplay is great, and features some truly touching moments. There is also some great camera work, thanks to the new Steadicam. It's a shame Stallone's later career and all the Rocky sequels have lessened this film in the eyes of many. This film is truly a classic and deserves to be seen at least once by everyone.Rocky is a 1976 American sports drama film directed by John G. Avildsen and both written by and starring Sylvester Stallone.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Chartoff-Winkler Productions, United Artists Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Burgess Meredith Director: John G.

Don't Breathe," It is an okay creepy horror rated-R film I enjoy it
","It is an okay horror film that I enjoyed and I like it, but in my opinion I think The People Under the Stairs and The Collector are way much better horror movies. I appreciate for what director Fede Álvarez did. I hated Evil Dead remake I though it was poorly paced and really boring movie except the ending. Jane Levy did really fine solid job as the hero I really love the movie has happy ending and Stephen Lang as the villain was good I know him from The Fugitive TV series (2000). I already saw the horror movies before about burglars breaking in the house and find them self's been the target and locked in the house. For my opinion The Collector is just much way better movie even The People Under the Stairs are just way much better movies.I do have one problem: I wish the movie would had more booby traps, I wish the death scenes would be more gory, it is a rated-R horror film, but still it was a good film, fast paced really intense and you keep rooting for the bad guys.Their sure-fire break-and-enter scheme provides them with steady income, but delinquents Rocky, Alex and Money keep hoping for a bigger score. Their wishes are granted when Money receives a tip about an enormous sum of cash rumored to be stashed in a home in a desolate suburb of Detroit belonging to a blind, solitary Iraq War veteran. A B&E plan is hatched and quickly put into motion. What could possibly go wrong? Although it was a bit lightweight and featured ethically-challenged protagonists, this was a decent-enough suspense flick.I didn't expect for this to be as good as it was. I was expecting a cheap thriller (this only had a budget of around $1 million) that did nothing for the viewers. I was not expecting to get goosebumps. This movie is twisted you got three idiots breaking in to somebody's house that is stupid, so we are going to root for the blind man - wrong: you will root for these three guys, when you find out what the blind guy has hiding in his house type of crazy weird sh**t going on in this movie and when they find out later on the end of the movie this is twisted creepy horror and I loved it.I love Don't Breathe this movie was thought out, well written, every little things let in to something else. I like that and I like someone thought that out I like that. One is on the other location and he can't see it. Fede Álvarez did a good job better than Evil Dead the blind man was great and really creepy and scary the thrills are there and they work good. It is my favorite 2016 horror film and I like it, I thought it was an okay and fun movie. I liked Acting is great, the story is top notch and it gives you the edge of your seat. I would not compared this movie with Panic Room because Panic Room was also a great flick as well. It both has the same amount of way. I enjoyed this movie since Panic Room.The ending was solid I love that Rocky survived she was not only sole survivor but Jane Levy's character was decent, she was breaking in to me someone else's house only to feed her young sister, they both have a messed up family and her mom is beating her, she survives and she takes her sister away but the blind man survives anyway. It is fast paced but in my personal opinion I like The Collector much more I thought Arkin (Josh Stewart) was much smart and way better protagonist. My rating is 8/10 solid B I like the movie in three weeks I am getting this movie on Blu-ray disc.Don't Breathe is a 2016 American horror-thriller film directed by Fede Álvarez and written by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues.

Inside Man," An excellent heist thriller flick with full twists around!
","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take an excellent heist flick, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Inside Man (2006) is not the best not the worst, just a good action-kinda thriller movie. It kept me interested the whole time, Denzel Washington as usual acts very well, Clive Owen also does the good job. This is really great bank robbery movie, it keeps you on your feet guessing what is going on and what will happen next, in this movie you tend to root for the robbers at the end just because how creative the idea was. This film is fast paced thriller, with full of twists around. It keeps get you guessing of what happened on the end of the film , what just happened now. Spike Lee has directed a movie very different than the other movies he has made, and it proves what an excellent and versatile director he is. If only other action movies were directed with such attention to quality. The story is well written, full of suspense, action and surprises, without relying on fancy special effects or impossible feats. The acting is also quite excellent and convincing. Highly recommended movie for a fun, thrilling, experience that will engage your senses and your mind.Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster where all incredible in their own roles. Here is even Willem Dafoe in it as Captain John Darius, for a long time I saw him in another positive role as the good guy beside Platoon (1986) my favorite Vietnam flick of all time!!! Great heist movie with solid and well acted script. Right from the opening scene we are treated to a mastermind performance from Clive Owen in which eventually leads to Denzel and also performance by Ms. Jodie Foster. Less we forget Christopher Plummer as well.The suspense inside the Bank of a group of bank robbers, who storm the bank and take everyone hostage, they dressed them in to a white suits, everyone thinks what is with a white suit, it is their camouflage. Christopher Plummer's character Arthur Case is a mystery and everyone has their own motive, their is no way out. I really miss 10.years back when movies where still great. I miss Jodie Foster. Inside Man is my favorite film, mainly because of Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster! I really miss Jodie Foster, I wish she would made another thriller like she did in the 80's in 90's. my favorite Jodie Fosters films of all time are: The Silence of the Lambs (1991) - I absolutely love this flick!, The Accused (1988) and Panic Room (2002) that was the first movie I went to see in the movie theater when it was released in 2002. Still I think this movie worked because of the incredible script that delivered all the goods and from the incredible cast crew who made the acting in this film perfect.This movie is a 10, it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative brilliant directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts and twists around with the incredible script. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing. In my opinion Spike Lee is a genius and did incredible idea to make a film. I am not his biggest fan, this was Denzel Washington's last and fourth movie he made with director Spike Lee. They are both great on their own way.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A total let down and a hug disappointment an awful movie
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in my opinion is too over long, over blown, over dramatic, over hyped and one of the most overrated MARVEL films! This is not a good movie it is so boring and it is to over dramatic! It is not entertaining movie, this film f****** sucks! Chris Pratt through half of the film doesn't do anything. Kurt Russell is awful his performance is boring ridiculous and terrible. Sylvester Stallone is in this movie but he is only in the beginning in one scene cameo role and then he disappears trough in tier film. He shows up in two scenes on the end of the film and he has only two liens. I was excepting more from Sly to be in it but he wasn't.What in my opinion this movie makes so terrible: Guardians of the Galaxy in the first half of the film were separated Peter Quill, Gamora and Drax fly to Quill's father planet and half of the movie the guardians are not together. The movie becomes boring and Kurt Russell is awful as Ego, Quill's father. Than the movie become melodramatic when it try's to focus on Quill's father and happiness he try's to get a score with Gamora I really don't care about their romance.Rocket and Baby Groot were left behind on the different planet in which Rocket try's to fix the ship and Yondu and his outlaws comes they overcome Rocket but Yondu's men turn all against him and they kill all his friends that was so awful and horrible to me. I didn't care about Rocket,Yondu and Baby Groot been friends. What I hated on this movie on the end of the film when they were finally together in the second movie Rocket left Quill and Yondu behind he left them behind to die what kind of hero is this? He left them all behind.They killed off Yondu, this movie killed of Yondu. This movie is terrible it is awful and it is a peace a junk! It is boring field with melodrama this movie is only for 6 year old children it is a child movie.The first movie was entertaining good written, original and a good film I like it, it was really enjoyable film to watch. This movie isn't it is not good. Thanos wasn't even in this movie. This movie is not funny I wasn't laughing and Chris Pratt doesn't do anything trough half of the film the music is terrible.This movie more focus more on Quill and his life legacy than on the Guardians of the Galaxy together. I did not read the comic books or watched the animation series I don't care I liked the first one this one I don't.I don't like this movie and it is too much praised. I will never watch this movie again and trough inter film only Ego (Kurt Russell) was the bad guy and find out he killed Quill's mom and he betrayed Quill he was killing all children what kind of murder did this movie created? This movie in my opinion it is too long really and becomes really boring it is really slow paced and it is just not a fans wanted at least me I think it is a huge let down and disappointment to me.Before I go I love Kurt Russell I love him in The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China, Escape From New York, Escape From L.A. and Tango & Cash in which he shared with Stallone together in this movie they are not in the same scene together. He was also good in Furious 7. Sylvester Stallone I am huge fan of his I love Rambo all 4 films to death, Cobra, Demolition Man, Cliffhanger, Tango & Cash, Nighthawks, Rocky all 6 films and I wish in this movie Sly would be more in it. I think Stakar Ogord role isn't for him at least he can could have do more in the movie.If you want to see a film about Galaxy watch Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope, Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi they are way better films than this even the first Guardian of the Galaxy was way better film. Score: F 1/10 avoid this movie like a plague.",1,6,12,14 August 2017
Rocky III," Rise and fall from grace - undoubtedly tied best classic movie with IV!
","Rocky III (1982) is definitely tied best Rocky film with IV. It is my third favorite Rocky film. The first one will always be the best. I think the third entry of the franchise is a big improvement over Rocky II in my opinion. He's on top of the world now, bags a statue, and for some reason, Adrian became attractive in this one. Like, REALLY attractive. He got soft, he got arrogant, and he got lazy. He lost his trainer, his title, and most of all, his self-respect to one of the most that makes me angry villains ever to grace the silver screen: Mr. T's Oscar-robbed performance as Clubber Lang and had to regain the 'eye of the tiger' to get it all back in front of the world. This one also proves further that Apollo Creed is human. Guy went from an arrogant prick and sore loser to Rocky's finest ally. Kudos, Carl. I love Mr. T he become famous after this movie there is also Hulk Hogan in it. Adrian in this movie is very supportive and I love Apollo how he was helping Rocky. Rocky III has a heart beside Rocky I.Why I love this film? This is the only Rocky film in which Adrian is well written - to further support my stance that III fires on all cylinders. Really, what purpose does Adrian serve in II, IV and V? She spends most of those movies telling Rocky not to fight - she is not supportive and just a burden to him. In this one, she actually encourages him and is an asset (speach on the beach.) Heck, there wouldn't be much of Rocky II if not for her objections to. It is the best all around Rocky movie. On a literary level (story), entertainment level, filmmaking level, boxing choreography, characters, etc... The fight at the end actually means something for Rocky. He has something to gain from it (unlike V.) This and Rocky I are the ONLY two Rocky movies where Adrian actually encourages Rocky the whole time (unlike II, IV, and V.) Mr. T is perfectly cast. It was so successful because it was the best. Rocky lost everything his manager, his title, his self respect and mostly he lost his edge! Like Apollo said 'Now, when we fought, you had that eye of the tiger, man; the edge! And now you gotta get it back, and the way to get it back is to go back to the beginning.' That's what I love. When you lose something don't quit. You need gained back the thing you lost. I love how Apollo motivated Rocky in this film and I think Apollo is well written and portrayed in here. I seriously I think Carl Weathers did a wonderful job portraying arrogant Apollo to an awesome Rocky's friend, to a support and ally. I was surprised Apollo was back in the third entry of the Series franchise. I love the training sequences and the music Score by Bill Conti the same score he used in Rocky I, and II. The same year that Sylvester Stallone made Rocky III the same year he went and started in First Blood, his famous role to this days Rambo! Carl Weathers also said that Rocky III is his favorite film he made. Not only that it is the only Rocky sequel film who won another Oscar award, which is the only one. Beside Carl Weathers I think Mr. T was the best actor portraying a villain in this movie I love how he provoked Rocky I really love that. This is the only film the lasted three rounds. The film has two fight with Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and more fights in which Rocky and Clubber are attending too in the opening scene. Rocky fights a wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) in this film. I also love the music score Eye of the Tiger performed by Survivor! I love this film it is my third best favorite rocky film alongside with Rocky IV. The rating I am giving is 9.5/10, I would have give it 10, I didn't because Mickey dies in this film and that was the most shocking disturbing scene to me. Three years and 10 successful title defenses after beating Apollo Creed, with whom he has become great friends, a now wealthy Rocky Balboa is considering retirement. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to Clubber Lang, who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's trainer Mickey. Rocky sinks into a depression, and Apollo decides to train Rocky for a rematch against Lang so Rocky can try to win the title back. That is the basic main plot. Rocky III is a 1982 American film written, directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is the third installment in the Rocky film series, and the second in the franchise to be directed by Stallone.9.5/10 Grade: A",10,42,47,3 November 2015
The Godfather: Part III," The Third Entry of the Godfather Trilogy isn't that great but it still good and it has some moments
","The Godfather Part III (1990) isn't the best film in the series like were the first two. This film should be release in 70's like the first two were, but it was released in 90's. This film still has some moments but is not that good just like the first two films were.Real Power Can't Be Given, It Must Be Taken.Some 16 years after Part II, The Godfather Part III brings us into the 1970's as an aging Michael Corleone has had enough of the family business as it was and wants to go legit. But other heads of New York families don't see it that way and he is forced to deal with his nephew, Vincent (Andy Garcia) who like his father (the late Sonny) wants to shoot first and ask questions later. Meanwhile Connie supports Vincent in his old school ways as she tries to sway Michael to stay firm on the old ways of the family. The subplot of the Vatican's interest in the Corleone family and the trails & tribulations of such offer a glimmer of purity for Michael or better yet his darkest fears. Godfather III never basked in the glory of Parts I & II, simply because it tried to hard to be just as perfect. Part III does have a solid story and great performances, but it just doesn't quite live up to expectations. Bottom line not quite the best swan song to the legacy of this series, but nonetheless a good effort by all involved.The third act isn't the greatest film like, were his predecessors but it is still a good film. People: It's not that bad. In fact, it's really good. Okay, it isn't a classic like the first two, and it suffers further by comparison to 'Goodfellas,' which came out just a few weeks before it. But 'Part III,' was still one of the best movies of its year (1990), thanks in large part to a devastating and necessary ending: Up to this point, Michael Corleone's evil had never been repaid with adequate suffering. And the King Lear-like climax on the steps of the opera house in Sicily, punctuated by Michael's mostly silent scream, provides a legitimately Shakespearean finish to the saga.What everyone knows about the film is that, at the last minute, Winona Ryder dropped out of playing the key role of Michael's daughter Mary Corleone and director Francis Ford Coppola unwisely replaced her with his own daughter, Sofia, who wasn't a trained actress. It showed. As an actress, Sofia is bland and whiny, though in her favor, it must be said that she seems much like the spoiled princess that Mary is supposed to be.Part III' has much else to recommend it: A thrillingly chaotic, completely unexpected shootout in a rooftop meeting room in Atlantic City, an equally well-staged bloodbath at the Little Italy street fair the Feast of San Gennaro, an intriguing conspiracist take on the events at the Vatican in 1979 (when three popes presided within a span of two months) and several more classic lines of dialogue added to the canon.The Godfather Part III is a 1990 American crime film written by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, and directed by Coppola. It completes the story of Michael Corleone, a Mafia kingpin who attempts to legitimize his criminal empire.The film also interweaves a fictionalized account of two real-life events into its plot: the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981 – 1982; both are linked to Michael Corleone's business affairs. The film stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Andy García, and features Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, George Hamilton, Bridget Fonda, and Sofia Coppola.The story is set in 1979 when, before retiring, an aging Michael Corleone tries to go legitimate by entering respectable real estate and communications deals, but is slowly drawn back into the world of organized crime against his will.7.5/10 Grade: B Studio: Paramount Pictures Starring: Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and Andy García, and features Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, George Hamilton, Bridget Fonda, and Sofia Coppola.

The Matrix Reloaded," One of the greatest action movies of all time!
","The Matrix Reloaded (2003) is the greatest action movie of all time and a good sequel to the original The Matrix (1999) that I went to see it with my mom in the movie theater in 1999 when the movie come out. I love this movie even if some people are saying is not that good I still love it and love The Matrix Revolutions as well. It is one of my personal favorite Keanue Reeves movies.Granted things get bigger and a little darker. The visual effects, go way overboard and the CGI does not bleed in well with the live action. Nonetheless Reloaded is a fun film to watch. The visual aspects blows out of the water. The soundtracks to this movie are pretty good and they are fine of mix songs to the movie.The sequel to successful original movie is an awesome film. Not just a visual wonder but the ambitious storytelling that demands more than your average action film. A wonderful follow up to the outstanding original and a great precursor to the inevitable finale. While it doesn't strictly adhere to normal flow of most films, that is one of its best traits. While it has its flaws, it makes for a fantastically entertaining experience. Not for those who don't want to think too much.It is a good sequel who doesn't deserve to be hated for it. Keanu Reeves and all other cast crew did outstanding performance on their works. Nearly 12 years later have passed since no movie has come close to tapping into the myth, world and action that was created in Matrix Reloaded. For fans of action movies, the story can be as straight forward as you wish it to be, following the path of Neo as man kinds savior. For those who wish to dive deeper, you can see how far the rabbit whole really goes because the amount of hidden references, back plots and information in this movie is immense. For a film The Matrix fans this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The CGI effects creating more Smiths were astonish, were cutting-edge for the time, and still look great (whoever said differently below is simply incorrect) -- even if they're completely commonplace today. Insane action ensues as a well done plot follows.Neo (Keanu Reeves) saving Trinity on the end of the film and than he collapses in to come was awesome and great ending with a cliffhanger so that viewer keeps guessing what will happened next, in the next movie that was just great. The Neo vs Smith fight is just excellent as is the Freeway chase. More Smiths (Hugo Weaving) I think Hugo Weaving did a perfect job as Agent Smith in this follow up sequel. I love his character and I think he is one of the best villains ever. Neo vs a 1000 Smiths fight scene just blew me away/ the martial arts were outstanding action sequences. Overall it is a good film at least it is for me. I will never understand the hate for the sequels for it. At the same time, the complexity of the storyline, and the unexpected plot twists left many viewers a little (or a lot!) confused. We'll admit that it's taken several viewings for us to figure some things out, and that there are still lots of pieces we haven't put into place. Some answers, we're sure, will not be revealed until Revolutions, and some will never be revealed. There are no words for Hugo Weaving except badass!Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, and the rest of their crew continue to battle the machines that have enslaved the human race in the Matrix. Now, more humans are waking up out of the matrix and attempting to live in the real world. As their numbers grow, the battle moves to Zion, the last real-world city and center of human resistance. That is the basic main plot and it is good so I am giving 9/10 for been a good action movie. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies.",9,114,138,15 November 2015
Die Hard," The greatest bad-ass best action movie hands down my personal favorite number 1 movie of all time
","Die Hard (1988) the first action film is by far one of the greatest best action movies of all time from the 80's till this day hands down. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much and I have fun watching it so much. I have to talk about this movie: It is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. Bruce Willis performance was excellent in this movie John McClane is his best role ever. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! It's stay in my heart forever. To me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? This film has heart and soul. A lot of movies have try to do that premise since, but no movie has nail it like 'Die Hard.' This is a modern day action film of the action genre. I watch this film as a teenager I even watch it with my mom it was ultimate thrill ride. I love everyone in here all the characters and the lead character. I love that McClane is alone he has no help, all telephones doesn't work he is barefoot with his gun and the only help has is from Sgt. Al Powell down there who didn't even see him at all but were both talking on a radio from cop to cop. I love that bond between those two lead heroes. I always love when McClane talks to himself whenever he was about to do something crazy. It is going to be 30 years anniversary this summer 20th July. I love this film to death I am hugh fan of Die Hard films I love this film so damn much. I would really love to see this movie in a widescreen in a movie theater. It was directed by brilliant John McTiernan it is is based on a novel Roderick Thorp Nothing Lasts Forever. This is a masterpiece action film that started all action genre one man army types battling terrorists while trapped in a confined space. It was arguably the first one in the action genre. This movie has everything . It has intense Action, Drama, Thriller, twists, great dialogue, explosions, fights. Exploding building, great helicopter explosion action scenes. John McClane is one man against a whole team of terrorists. A cracking Action Thriller from beginning to end, Die Hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense! It has great cast, great plot, great explosions, no shaky cam, doesn't deal with CGI, but real actions real practical effects. Great Direction from John McTiernan, great dialogues, great acting from everyone. Everyone does an excellent job. Bruce Willis is a bad ass action star as John McClane. It has a great bad-ass action hero who does impossible buy stopping the terrorists who were actually a real terrorists who try to steal the money in a vault 640.000.000$ in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault. My favorite action sequences and the best part of Die Hard: McClane grabs the fire hose, ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane climbs in the elevator shaft escapes Karl and his men trying to kill him. McClane shoots on the table with his gun killing Marco. (According to the director, the proximity of the gun to Willis' ear during this scene caused permanent hearing loss for Willis.) 
McClane shot's Hans and Eddie 'Happy - Trails, Hans...' Incredibly satisfying action in a brilliant action movie! McClane try to save Ellis when Ellis try to save him self. McClane was afraid of flying and he always carry gun because he was afraid someone would have hijack it. The fight between Karl and John was excellent and well choreographed. McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from, giving the cops a chance to retreat. I love The broken glass scene. He shoot's and kills two terrorists with his machine gun to escape Hans and Karl, John McClane is forced to sprint over broken glass while barefoot the best bad-ass scene in the movie my all time favorite. Three terrorists are shooting on McClane on the roof chasing him in which he escapes in the beginning of the movie awesome. Karl shoots in an elevator shaft in which McClane is hiding a real kick-ass scene I love this film to death! I love the characters in this movie: John McClane a real action hero to me that does something that no one can he stops a team of terrorists. Hans Grubar the German mastermind he was ruthless and brilliant and he would do anything to steal the money even killing people and get what he want's. Alan Rickman's performance was excellent I love him to death in this movie. I really miss the actor he was the best villain of the whole world. The LAPD Supervisor (Diana James) I like that girl she was so good when McClane call's her for help, I love it. I love Sgt. Al Powell how he stand's up and defends McClane against his supervisor. Reginald VelJohnson does a brilliant performance as a great supporting hero in this movie. I love Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson to death he is my favorite character in here. Paul Gleason was so good I love his performance - 'kick ass.' I love how he tried everything to safe the hostages including SWAT team who were badly hurt. I like Richard Thornburg in this movie who is annoying reporter but I still like it. Bonnie Bedelia as Holly McClane's wife was great.John McTiernan directed excellent this masterpiece Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza wrote a script that it delivers. The helicopters in here were models in this movie delivered, to me the action scenes felt realistic. This movie has ton's of action and you never get bored with it. Michael Kamen made a music score and you never get bored with it. You'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody rated R with real blood squibs. 10/10 it is my favorite action film in the action genre I love this film to death it is my personal action favorite film. I miss movies like this I miss action movies like this one today I want them back. It is a shame we don't have movies like this today.",10,146,179,4 February 2018
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A terrible sequel of the Transformers franchise but not the worst one!
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2012) is a forgettable, exhausting science fiction action film. Not the worst one in the series it still a good one in some moments. The worst one that would be Age of Extinction because the film it is just too long and boring. This movie was good, but it lacks on a story and it is forgettable for me. Sam Witwicky goes now for college and he wants to focus more now on his life. He accidentally cross a path on an ancient mystery implanted into his mind by the now-destroyed AllSpark, who has to now unravel ancient origins of the Transformers. Megatron wants to caught Sam while ancient mystery he has in his brain so he can resurrected Fallen and is planning the revenge on the world. Now Sam and his friends have to run for his life and try to stop the Decepticons before is too late. In this one Megatron dies, but on the end of the movie he actually get's resurrected and get's back to life and he stops Fallen. I liked the ending that was the perfect in the film. The film tends to sag in the middle when the action slows down to progress some of the silly plot. Transformers is not a film about plot, it's about the action - just keep it coming and don't try to make a story from it because it's RIDICULOUS; - Megan Fox still looks amazingly hot but cannot act to save her life. She was too hot and she just did not gave a good acting performance. You may as well just put a cardboard cut-out of her next to Shia Labeouf and it'll do the same job for a fraction of the cost; - A scene towards the end of the movie where there is a small 'dream sequence' of sorts, and the word 'destiny' is mentioned. I almost vomited. The word 'ridiculous' doesn't quite do it justice; - The girl that Sam meets at college and who she is. I am simply AMAZED that they actually let that whole thing get put into the movie - it just doesn't fit into the Transformers world and leaves stupendous plot holes and questions; - There isn't enough slow-motion in the action sequences for you to take it all in - Transformers trying to be 'funny' - yuck.This movie had everything the fans were waiting for. The story fit, and didn't go willy-nilly. My honesty of the four Transformers. The first one is only the best one and worth to watch it. I watch this movie in 2011 before the third one was released and I thought was better than the first one but no it wasn't. The first movie I always enjoy this one I just can't. Transformers was the only movie I watch it several times. I give up with the last three, I only liked was the music theme they really had wonderful music theme. I didn't got it what was with those pyramid things and who of Transformers was who, they all looked the same The movie got me exhausted, I thought Mikaela was hot and sexy in the beginning of the movie on the bike and the story started wonderful but than just all blow it off and was too long. Sam annoyed me in the beginning when he started screaming Bumblebee and ugh. Transformers 2 is terrible lacking movie, confusing and is the worst story telling and I don't got it either what was with the story. The only thing I enjoy in the movie was the music.I Like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen because of the music. 2.weeks ago I did got it 2 BD and I love it. I would watch the third one after the first one. The problem with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was Megan Fox she was to damn hot, she shouldn't be but not all that. They put to much romance than action and less story in it. The final battle in the pyramids wasn't that great as the first one was, Dark of the Moon is Better. The music makes the movies.' Anyway Movie - disappointing! Too much unnecessary comedy. The action was very good, but what was with all of the robot spit? The confusing plot about the film. One of the most popular, thrill-packed, franchises of all time is back with even more action and more Autobots and Decepticons! In the highly anticipated Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Decepticon forces return to Earth on a mission to take Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) prisoner, after the young hero learns the truth about the ancient origins of the Transformers. Joining the mission to protect humankind is Optimus Prime, who forms an alliance with international armies for a second epic battle.I am giving this film a 6/10 because there were moments in the film that I did enjoy them, and there were moments I just couldn't enjoy and did not got it. Still Age of Extinction is seriously the worst one, even Revenge of the Fallen isn't that terrible movie than Age of Extinction is. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen , is a 2009 American science fiction action film directed by Michael Bay and executive produced by Steven Spielberg.

Army of Darkness," The best one in The Evil Dead Trilogy! THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK!!!
","Army of Darkness (1992) is in my opinion by far the best one of the 'Evil Dead' trilogy! It is my second favorite film of the trilogy, I just love, love this movie to death!!!! It is my personal favorite horror movie in the Evil Dead series. The best one is the theatrical cut the rest versions are pure crap with lameness. The original cut kicks ass!!! Great movie! This movie is so silly, that it's actually funny. I have always loved Army of Darkness and I always will. I love this film to death!!!! I was watching with my dad this film and even he loved it. So yes I proud to say I love this film and I have enjoyed More than the original The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987)! This film has funny moments, balance, smart genius creativity, great babes, mystic forces and mystic knights in it.Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun. Army of the dead who were actually skeletons were fabulous, the fights were awesome and they and they were highly enjoyable. The film was fast paced from the beginning till the end. I am sorry if you guys love Evil Dead 2 much better than this film, I just love Army of Darkness much better, this film is just a great worthy sequel to their predecessors. Ash is like ably hero on screen and he is one of the most popular hero's till it's days. Army of Darkness is a classic. Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, & the special effects masters KNB! You cant ask for more. Great story, funny lines, fantastic looking monsters. I don't care what anyone says I just love this film to death!!! What we get in here is a hybrid of sorts with Bruce Campbell once again as Ash the reluctant hero fighting ghouls and goblins (well maybe not goblins) in the medieval times. This third chapter goes for more of the laughs rather then the scares and actually offers up a fun take on the genre mix director Sam Raimi tells. The movie is not as annoying as the previous 2 films and closes out the trilogy nicely. They are a lot of talks of an Army of Darkness 2 and I don't want any sequel to this horror/comedy flick. I thought this film closed the trilogy beautiful. There is a lots of comic relief, over the top cuts, BOOMSTICK!!!!! Army of Darkness is my second favorite movie (Evil Dead II, Dark Knight, ARMY OF DARKNESS) and here's why. It follows the character of Ashley (Ash) J. Williams in his journey to the past that is far better explained in Evil Dead II. He is only able to be sent back to his own time (and his job at S Mart) if he finds the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) which will also free the people who can help him from the attacks of the deadites. Ash has to find the book, get the babe, fight some demons, and get back home...like in the deal. This movie has it all, and some sugar, baby! It is a hilarious, gory, wonderful display of Bruce Campbell's ingenious acting ability, and anyone who says differently is a deadite. It's a film that would make Clive Barker proud. An oddball yet absolutely successful pairing of slapstick Comedy and undead Horror with a medieval setting thrown into the mix for good measure, 1992's Army of Darkness sits proudly near the top of the list of most unconventional yet absolutely entertaining motion pictures in history. Following up on 1981's oft-banned The Evil Dead and 1987's The Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (itself a Horror-Comedy hybrid), Army of Darkness represents the most accessible and audience-friendly of the three. Special effects; gore; humor; and of course, Bruce Campbell's over-the-top antics are Awesome!!! Hail to the king, baby.Army of Darkness is a 1992 American dark fantasy action comedy film directed by Sam Raimi. It is the third installment of the Evil Dead franchise. The film was written by Sam Raimi and his brother Ivan, produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell (also acting as co-producer) and Embeth Davidtz. Continuing from Evil Dead II, Ash Williams (Campbell) is trapped in the Middle Ages and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.Beyond in human flesh, inked in blood-and amazingly hard to pronounce-the ancient 'Necronomicon' (Book of the Dead) unleashes unspeakable evil upon mankind in director Sam Raimi's (Spider-Man) outrageously hilarious sword-and-sorcery epic. Back to do battle with the hideous 'Deadites,' Bruce Campbell reprises his role from the Evil Dead series as Ash, the handsome, shotgun-toting, chainsaw-armed department store clerk from S-Mart's housewares division. Demonic forces time warp him-and his '73 Oldsmobile-into England's Dark Ages, where he romances a beauty (Embeth Davidtz) and faces legions of undead beasts, including a ghastly army of skeletons. Can Ash save the living from the dead, rescue his girlfriend and get back to his own time? This movie is personal second favorite movie it is 10/10.",10,53,60,24 October 2015
Scream 2," Flawles but yet enjoyable horror slasher sequel flick
","Scream 2 is flawless but enjoyable sequel it is not better than the first one but much way better than part 4. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson does return for this sequel but still I enjoy the third one much way more. The second sequel was good little different mixed with action and humor, but it wasn't that scary to me. It is really a step down from the first film. I have a lot of problems with this film. The bad: The writer Kevin Williamson copied the first film why would they copy the first film? I don't get it. The film looks like the same as the first movie, first the name of the town was Windsor like in the first movie Woodsboro: Then the victims were killed whit the same names and surnames the same emo from the first killer. Than was a copy killer on the loose and than they were like two killers just one wants to get away, the other wants to get caught. Deputy Sheriff David Arquette as Dewey Riley did do nothing in this movie and he was useless in this film! He was complaining, yelling and did do nothing, he was slashed but yet again he survived, how did he survive? or why is he in this movie is yet beyond me. Kevin Williamson wrote his character dull and awful. Marco Beltrami copied and stole the theme music score from Hans Zimmer music score for Broken Arrow (1996) John Woo film. The humor I didn't like in here and I didn't like they were talking about Stab fictional movie in this film that was based on Scream film. Jada Pinkett Smith was in the beginning in this film and she was terrible. Most of the characters in this film are awful. The good: I love the ghostface killer in this movie and he doesn't use so much scary movies questions like in the first movie, he simply kills fast his victims. I love Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott she was lovely, such a sole survivor, such a bad-ass even more sexy than in the first film. Her ass was sexy, man o man she was hot! I fall in love with her, I did enjoy her performance as Sidney. I enjoy Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers this time she had a different hair cut but she was still good in her performance as a nosy tabloid reporter. The most hero I enjoy in this movie is Liev Schreiber as Cotton Weary he is awesome!!! A true real hero he is excellent! I really did enjoy the plot twist and his character. Sarah Michelle Gellar as Casey 'Cici' Cooper is in here she is really good and Timothy Olyphant as Mickey from Live Free or Die Hard is in here! The cast work really well. 8/10 It is a good slasher horror movie and a good sequel to the first one I still watch this films, I like this film and the trilogy. I like the song 'She Said by Collective Soul excellent song. My third favorite film in the series but still a good one, doesn't deserve the hate.",10,84,111,18 February 2018
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Die Hard With A Vengeance is not only a great movie, it is arguably the best masterpiece sequel of all time!
","Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995) is the third film in the popular Die Hard franchise, which re teamed Bruce Willis with John McTiernan, the director of the first film. It is my second favorite Die Hard film in the franchise. It feel's fast paced, more realistic and more action movie to me. It is not boring or slow, I love the characters: John McClane, Zeus Carver, Simon Gruber, Joe Lambert, Connie Kowalski, Charlie Weiss, Katya and Mathias Targo. No CGI real action sequences, real explosions, real stunt performances. McClane fires a power line, severing it in to the helicopter blowing up the chopper to pieces amazing my personal favorite scene. I love this movie to death, this is my movie and it is my personal favorite action film. Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995) is a near-perfect summer movie. It is one of my personal favorite action movies. It is so good as the first one, I couldn't decide which one I love to Death: Die Hard or Die Hard With a Vengeance. I love this movie to death it is my number 1 favorite action film in Die Hard series and action films. I love the original Die Hard to death but I love this sequel much more. That's my personal opinion. This franchise effort is a gleeful no-brainer with nonstop action. Die Hard With A Vengeance I really do believe is the greatest action sequel and a true masterpiece to the first movie. It gives some additional action pleasure, as we get to watch action heroes Bruce Willis get smacked around for 128 minutes. In this third outing with John McClane, we are faced with yet another mad bomber on the loose. Jeremy Irons plays Simon, an East German Special Forces Colonel-turned-terrorist mastermind and the older brother of Hans Gruber, who has a score to settle with Detective McClane. Simon's bombing game comes complete with crafty riddles, which must be solved in a specified time or everything goes boom. McClane has no choice but to play. Along the way, he picks up an unlikely accomplice named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), a Harlem shopkeeper. Together they tear all over New York trying to head off disaster. Sure, it's all perfectly preposterous, but DIE HARD 3 has been directed with breathless intensity by John McTiernan, who certainly has a way with wrecking things. Was he very destructive as a child? Loved the spectacular subway crash, John. That hair-raising taxi ride through Central Park wasn't bad, either. I love the fact that they are saving kids from school. Charlie try's to disabled the bomb in school while Kowalski and Lambert are saving those kids stuck in the building I love that scene. McClane and Carver are desperately searching for the code for the bomb to disabled it, I love it to death. Don't forget to fasten your seat belts for this ride. It's often said that McTiernan and Hensleigh simply ignored Die Hard 2, and in terms of direct plot and dialogue references, this may be true, but they still give Die Hard 2 a nod by having an attendant humor--often almost 'goofy' humor--in many action scenes. One of the most direct nods occurs with McClane 'riding' something of an explosion (of water this time). This is one of the more hilarious scenes of the film.Die Hard with a Vengeance is a 1995 American action film and the third in the Die Hard film series. It was produced and directed by John McTiernan (who directed Die Hard), written by Jonathan Hensleigh, and stars Bruce Willis as New York City Police Department Lieutenant John McClane, Samuel L. Jackson as McClane's reluctant partner Zeus Carver, and Jeremy Irons as Simon Peter Gruber. Twenty years ago, after two blockbuster movies and a five-year wait, the 'Die Hard' franchise roared back into theaters with the explosive 'Die Hard with a Vengeance.' The movie was released on May 19, 1995, and it was an instant classic, thanks to a smart script, exciting plot, and the absolutely stellar chemistry between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. But not only was 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' a great movie, it was also arguably the best of its kind: unstoppable, and untoppable.Die Hard With A Vengeance was filmed before CGI made it possible to create scenes like this without breaking a single window, this moment is utter, terrifying perfection.How often do you get an action flick where the heroes spend the entire first half of the film solving puzzles to save lives? In a franchise that distinguishes itself with action that toes the line between 'creative' and 'ridiculous,' 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' stays on brand, in the best way.John McClane and a Harlem store owner are targeted by German terrorist Simon Gruber in New York City, where he plans to rob the Federal Reserve Building. 10/10 Score: bad Ass Seal Of Approval my personal second favorite Die Hard action movie.",10,107,122,15 October 2015
Con Air," Classic high energy Nicholas Cage's best action flick he ever made!
","Con Air (1997) is a classic high energy Nicholas Cage's best bad-ass action flick from the 90's of the decade he ever made! I grew up watching this film as a child and honestly it was my favorite action film and the first one from Nicholas Cage I have ever saw. After seeing Con Air for the first time, I bagged my mom to buy me The Rock and Face/Off along with Con Air on VHS because of Nicholas Cage! I still have all three films on VHS and I also have them on Blu-ray. I don't like Face/Off anymore I have my reasons, but Con Air is a bad ass action film and it is still my favorite action film today that I love to death. I have a blast watching this film.Plot: Newly paroled ex-con and former U.S. Ranger Cameron Poe finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane when the passengers seize control.The film is actually about Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) U.S. Ranger who accidentally kills a man in self defense when three goon's try's to kill him. Cameron confesses the crime, but because of his military past, Cameron gets 7 - 10. years maximum prison after years his paroled and only what he want's is to get home to his wife and to his daughter he never saw before. Cameron has to share a prison airplane with some of the country's most dangerous criminals, who actually take control of the plane and are now planning to escape the country. Cameron has to find a way to stop them while playing along. Meanwhile, United States Marshal Vincent Larkin (John Cusack) is trying to help Cameron get free and stop the criminals, including Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich).Everyone in the cast is great and Nic Cage's Cameron Poe is one of my favorite action heroes of all time. With such lines as 'I'm gonna show you God does exist' and 'I'm gonna save the f**king day' you know you're dealing with a Grade A bad ass. He's not without a sensitive side though as he is prone to crying like a girl at some points too. Con Air is directed from Simon West, who directed also The Expendables 2 another film , that I love. Why I love this movie: You have a solid likable cast that I love, awesome score from Mark Mancina, cool characters, ton's of action, a lot's of explosions, lot's of gun fire and awesome fights, including incredible stunts that I love. Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, Renoly Santiago, Danny Trejo, Mykelti Williamson, Rachel Ticotin, Colm Meaney, Dave Chappelle, Nick Chinlund, Steve Buscemi, Monica Potter and M. C. Gainey gave us a wonderful action performance in a action film I have ever seen.Nicolas Cage as Cameron Poe is a bad ass action decent hero, that I love him so much. John Cusack as U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin is awesome and incredible likable hero in this movie. John Malkovich as Cyrus Grissom is a bad ass villain and he is also very brilliant and insane. Colm Meaney as DEA Agent Duncan Malloy is amazing I really love this actor in this film. Mostly I remember Colm from Under Siege who played Dummer William Stranix's (Tommy Lee Jones) second hand, even in Under Siege I loved him as acting performance. I love Colm's character in this movie. Nick Chinlund as William Bedford was awesome I love the fight scenes with Billy and Cameron and Billy says to Cameron 'Die Punk!' and Cameron kill's him. I love Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene, I love his character I don't think his character is dangerous or a serial killer, because on the airport Garland doesn't kill a young girl a child, I think he redeemed him self. Last one that I love is Ving Rhames as Nathan Jones was another bad ass villain.I love that Cameron is desperately try's to safe his friend's life Mike O'Dell aka Baby-O (Mykelti Williamson) and get him out of the plane and he try' to safe Guard Sally Bishop (Rachel Ticotin) off the plain. He even safe's her on the plain twice when Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo) try's to rape her. I love that Baby-O protects Cameron against Cyrus and confess that he is a traitor on a plain, but he wasn't. I love this flick.There a re a lot of action scenes that I completely love and I have enjoyed them including a explosion's fire truck who explodes in Las Vegas. A lot of gun fights. Cameron using his martial art's skills on a air field, Cameron beating three guys on a plain and force the pilot to land the plain down. The car chase scenes in Las Vegas where incredible Vince and Cameron see them Cyrus,Swamp Thing and Jones trying to flee, pursue them on motorcycles. Overall: Con Air (1997) get's a perfect 10 by for incredible awesome high energy solid action flick of the 90's that I love to death! Con Air is a 1997 American action film directed by Simon West and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of The Rock. It stars Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, and John Malkovich.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Possibly one of the worst trilogy's awful and horrible of film
","Where should i begin? I am a fan of Star Wars since my childhood. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope(1977), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) were one of the best movies ever made of the trilogy and created. I watched every singly movie they were the best. Mark Hamill,Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher were terrific whole three movies are awesome, the best. But now The Prequel trilogy awful horrible. I am giving this episode 1.star and that is all. Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) was start one of the worst and boring movies i have ever seen. I seen bad movies but this one was the worst. First from the beginning was the movie completely boring and dull seriously. Jar Jar Binks whoever played that character look like a cartoon moron seen on screen,he looked really ridiculous. No wonder that actor who played him did had a small part and possibly two or three lines in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) and in this movie he barely appeared without any word, no one explained what happened to him because he was so unpopular. In Star Wars I the only thing i thought was really great to watch was Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala / Padmé she was really beautiful and great chick she gave it a wonderful performance and i had a crush on her than is Darth Maul played by Ray Park and of course Peter Serafinowicz wonderful outstanding performance .Than the fight with Liam Neeson,Ewan McGregor and Ray Park as Darth Maul was wonderful.The only thing in the movie that was dull was the story and it was lacking,too boring and too long movie it could have been better. I gave the first movie 3.stars for horrible performance and lacking of the story. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were possibly as best as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi.Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) i gave this movie 7.stars because the movie was excitement and filled with adventure mostly i adore love between Padmé and Anakin that thrill me the mostly great action and excitement between Obi-Wan Kenobi,Padmé and of course Anakin Skywalker mostly i love romance and drama and when Padmé and Anakin gets married at the end of the movie and the war begins the movie was great. Now Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) Now i am just giving this movie 1.star because it is one of the worst one of the trilogy. The movie like Episode I is really boring the most i hated was tragic death of Padmé death of these children George Lucas are you insane for putting this thing in this movie? What were you thinking! Death of Mace Windu played by awesome and wonderful Samuel L.Jackson.Still a lot of people enjoy this movie saying it is one of the best movies that possible Lucas made it in my opinion is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. The Same as The X-Files Season 9 horrible horrible performance this movie dose not deserve a great performance.How did this movie won an Oscar and got 7.stars? I am wondering really. Why is this movie title Revenge of the Sith huh? In the Episode I Obi-Wan Kenobi killed Darth Maul they ask them self who did they kill ' The Master or the Apprentice'? I thought that in this movie that Sith will get revenge on Obi-Wan Kenobi for the death of Darth Maul,boy was i wrong. This movie and end truly disappointed me,I must say. I hated the death of a beautiful beautiful Padmé i even assumed that she will killed her self and she did but that Anakin would hurt her? even he was dark never! He could never hurt her, he loved her till death and wow Obi-Wan Kenobi beat him at the end of the fight? Seriously? Darth Vader killed him in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope! I was even planing to buy all Six movies all trilogy on Blu-Ray you even got 3. bonus discs material with special features in complete box for 89,99 but after i finish this trilogy i changed my mind i am rather going to buy single original trilogy but only them on Blu-Ray and i will skip this trilogy i can't watch them anymore i can't. I am sorry about the fans they like them, but i don't. Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) is more for 8 or 10 year old children for watching this movie i don't know and about trilogy only it is horrible performance. Mostly that disturbed me was performance from Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi he looked like more as a damn joke including master Yoda. I agree with some critics Hey George Lucas you ruined Star Wars and now your planing to film Episode VII and VIII? Wake me up of this nightmare.",1,1,3,9 January 2013
Bring It On," Classic cheer for the best teen movie and an original film
","Bring It On (2000) is a underrated teen cheerleading movie with Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku. It is my favorite high school teen comedy and I honestly don't care what anyone says about this film. A champion high school cheerleading squad discovers its previous captain stole all their best routines from an inner-city school and must scramble to compete at this year's championships. I love this film. Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) was the most memorable and my favorite character from my all time favorite actress Kirsten Dunst. I went trough high school watching this film. I love sport comedy films, like were Major League (1989) and I love this team sport comedy film. It was followed by four direct-to-video sequels, none of which contain any of the original cast members. Bring It on is original true, the best, cheerleading comedy in the film series. I love this film and I always will, it is my favorite film of all time. At least it is much better than they are teen comedy this days. Jessica Bendinger wanted to mix cheerleading and hip-hop, the two tastes that taste great together, it's like peanut butter and chocolate, which she did. The choreography very beautiful, the dance moves were pretty good and amazing. Long before 'Pitch Perfect' became a hit franchise and every group of women became our #squadgoals, there were the Toros and the Clovers. Fifteen years ago this month, Universal released 'Bring It On' into theaters, a low budget, high-school comedy about rival cheerleading teams that spawned four spin off films, a stage musical, and helped pave the way for the Barden Bellas, the McKinley glee club and many more The plot of the film centers on Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst), who inherits the position of captain on her high school's cheerleading squad and attempts to lead her team to a sixth national title. However, Torrance is informed by the newest team member, Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku), that she is in possession of a stolen routine. When the originators of the work vow to win, Torrance and her squad must go to different lengths in order to create an original performance.The Toro cheerleading squad has spirit, spunk, sass and a killer routine that's sure to land them the national championship trophy for the sixth year in a row. But for newly-elected team captain, Torrance (Kirsten Dunst), the Toro's road to cheer glory stumbles when she discovers their perfectly choreographed routines were stolen from a hot hip-hop squad across town. Now the squad must scramble to find a new routine to compete in this year's competition.I love this movie and I am not saying that as a blonde or a cheerleader! No offense : / This is the best Bring It On movie out of all of them. Kirsten Dunst in an amazing actress. This movie is funny, very cute, and the original Bring It On! At Rancho Carne High School, cheerleading is everything to student Torrance (Kirsten Dunst), who aching to be named head cheerleader of school squad the Toros, continuing the aggressive pursuit of dominance started by graduating member, Big Red (Lindsay Slone). Requiring a new cheerleader to help fill a gap caused by an accident, the squad welcomes Missy (Eliza Dushku) to the team, though the new student isn't sure her cynical ways are a good fit, while her brother, Cliff (Jesse Bradford), welcomes the assimilation, attracted to Torrance and her indefatigable spirit. When she realizes routines established by Big Red are actually stolen from the East Compton Clovers, led by icy Isis (Gabrielle Union), Torrance loses confidence, requiring support from the splintered Toros and outside influences as she attempts to rebuild what was lost. Director Peyton Reed and screenwriter Jessica Bendinger (who tried to reheat her formula for 2006's 'Stick It') favor bigness when it comes to the antics contained in 'Bring It On.' Summoning blinding cheerleading spirit, the production turns the quest for trophies into a cartoon, complete with aggressive close-ups and screamed line readings, while the writing retains finger-snap timing and an interest in developing its own vocabulary (e.g. Torrance demanding that the Toros are not a 'cheerocracy'), always on the go in terms of characterization and plotting (a mid-movie detour with the Toros and a professional choreographer harboring an obsession with 'spirit fingers' is amusing). The rating I am giving is 10/10 for been Entertained sport film. The film isn't perfect, it has flaws. The Toros cheerleading squad should have win on the end of the film and they didn't. That move hurt the film. In all the sequels all cheerleading squad team won in this film they didn't. The film is good because of Kirsten Dunst. Believe it or not, it's been 15 years since everyone's favorite campy cheerleader movie, ​Bring It On​, debuted. Kirsten Dunst, aka captain Torrance Shipman, appeared on ​The Late Late Show With James Corden ​last night and talked about her first major lead role. 'None of us knew it would become a hit,' she says. 'We were just a couple of young people in San Diego making a Universal film no one cared about.10/10 Grade: A Studio: Beacon Communications Starring: Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Jesse Bradford, Gabrielle Union, Clare Kramer Director: Peyton Reed Producers: Marc Abraham, Thomas Bliss Screenplay: Jessica Bendinger Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 1 Hr. 38 Mins.

Platoon," A Realistic Vietnam film Oliver's Stone's masterpiece
","Platoon is a 1986 American war film written and directed by Oliver Stone one of the most strongest realistic anti war films of all time. It is one of the best Vietnam war films I have ever seen that won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1986 and best Director for Oliver Stone, as well as Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing. Stone's Vietnam film portrayed a real life human been on his point of view of the story telling that went on in his real life that he experienced after his tour of duty in Vietnam ended in 1968, Oliver Stone wrote a screenplay called Break: a semi-autobiographical account detailing his experiences and the life he was in Vietnam. The characters were portrayed more then a few soldiers they were portrayed more as a human been than been soldiers obeying an order.Platoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. Those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning in this life. In Platoon, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a young, naive U.S. soldier who, upon his arrival to Vietnam, quickly discovers that he must do battle not only with the Viet Cong, but also with the gnawing fear, physical exhaustion and intense anger growing within him. While his two commanding officers draw a fine line between the war they wage against the enemy and the one they fight with each other, the conflict, chaos and hatred permeate Taylor, suffocating his realities and numbing his feelings to man's highest value... life.Chris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves, each aligned with one of two men -- Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). Those two soldiers are really two positive good things to see in the film because it sets the viewer on the seat of the edge. They both have nominally the same enemy (Viet Cong), but, really, it doesn't take long to realize that Elias is Good, and Barnes is Evil (the 'enemy' does not enter into the moral equation of this film, at all it's an outside threat, same as malaria-carrying mosquitoes or even friendly fire). Elias feels the futility of the war and has respect for life; Barnes fights the war doggedly and has no compassion, period. Both are efficient soldiers fighting the same enemy, but really as is at one point aptly put by Chris Taylor himself,they are fighting for the souls of the platoon members, as the outcome of the war is never really in doubt.The platoon reaches the village, where a food and weapons cache is discovered. While questioning the village chief, Barnes loses his patience and senselessly kills the man's wife despite his denials that they are aiding the Viet Cong. Barnes is about to murder the man's young daughter to force him to tell them to where the enemy is. Elias doesn't take kindly to this kind of behavior. Elias and Barnes come closer and closer to open conflict, as Taylor becomes a veteran, obviously siding with Elias. Meanwhile, the fate of the platoon comes closer and closer to them, culminating in an explosively shot action conclusion. The end is dark, but morally satisfying.Platoon is a legendary film. A film that I will always cherish, and a film that I will never get tired of. And the last Vietnam film worth a damn to watch. There isn't any War film today that was filmed as really human drama war today in 2015. It respectively represents the very essence of purposefully haunting powerful cinematography in the history.-- It is representing admirable cinematic craftsmanship and storytelling. A film that is sometimes impossible to watch for its frighteningly intense and emotionally draining account of the Vietnam War as it is waged both on the battlefields and within the very souls of men.The best real human drama portrayed on screen anti-war film in Vietnam from the 80's, It is my favorite film that I will always love to death to see. I also don't watch this film for an action ; I actually see it for the war and how it everything was, what is more valuable and it is life: The film also have a message in it. The actors portraying the characters did make a believable performance as the real team of squad soldier fighting the Enemy the Viet Cong.The battles with Viet-Cong are shown realistic mostly on the end of the final battle. 10/10",10,123,136,14 October 2015
Scream," The best teenage horror slasher film in the 90's my all time personal favorite in the horror genre
","Scream is the best teenage horror slasher film in the 90's and it is my all time personal favorite film in the horror genre. I love this film I always did and I love to death! It was really the first movie that introduced me in to 'horror' genre slasher films. It was directed from my favorite horror master Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. It is a horror mystery like was Friday the 13th and April Fool's Day. Scream deserve legendary status. The movie spawned three sequels and the TV series that I did like. Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox and Rose McGowan work for me. It is about a high school teenage student in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California, who becomes the target of a mysterious killer known as Ghostface who kills teens and who uses his obsession with scary movies. The first one is the best in the series and it is still one of the best horror films of all time. Wes Craven borrowed and used Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare On Elm Street mostly scenes for this movie. It mentions a lot of cult classic horror movies and till it's day it is still praised by fans. I enjoy this film I always do. This is my movie and my personal opinion! Scream follows the teenage girl Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who becomes targeted by a psychotic killer dressed in a ghostface mask who uses his obsession with scary movies. David Arquette plays police deputy, Dewey Riley who helps protect Sidney and Courtney Cox plays tabloid reporter, Gale Weathers. This is one of Craven's best along with 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' that redefined the genre and Ghostface has become another popular slasher since. 'What's Your Favorite Scary Movie?' Ghostface is one of the most popular and really scary character. The mask is so scary before new year on Halloween day I saw the mask putted on a front seat in the car and i was so scared, I thought it was the killer waiting on me but it was only a mask but a scary one. The Story begins after two high school students are murdered by the serial killer. Sidney Prescott becomes next victim of intelligent serial killer, Gale Weathers reporter and journalist is shure that serial killer is the same person who murdered Sidney's mother one year ago and now he's terrorizing Sidney her self. Deputy Sheriff Dewey wants to investigate the murders by himself, but attractive Gale seduced and confused him, so it's up to Sidney to find the killer, before he kills again to find the truth, she will must kill. I love also the characters: Matthew Lillard as Stu Macher, Rose McGowan as Tatum Riley and Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks. Great story and great soundtracks. I watch this movie thirty times and is still the best, I watch with my mom as a teen good times. I love the script the dialogues in this movie, I love Drew Barrymore as Casey Becker in here.10/10 Scream deserves a legendary status it is my personal favorite horror slasher film from Wes Craven in the franchise.

Scream," Scream is the best horror movie ever made
","Scream is the best horror movie ever made.Because this movie i like other horror movies.But this one is the best.Who's not agree with me is a stupid idiot.I love this and both sequels i have all three of them on tape and i never complain about this.One of the best movie,i like character Sidney Prescott and her friends,boyfriend Billy,friends Randy and Stuart,the deputy sheriff Dewey and reporter Gale Weathers were great.Great story and great soundtracks.I watch this movie thirty times and is still the best,better then Friday the 13 or Halloween they are both bullshit and they still filming this movies but scream are ending in the third.I can say they don't doing movies like this anymore.The Story begins after two high school students are murder by the serial killer Sidney Prascott become next victim of intelligent serial killer,Gale Weathers reporter and journalist is shore that serial killer is the some who murder Sidney mother one year ago and he's now terrorize her,deputy sheriff Dewey won't to investigate the murders hem'self but attractive Gale seduced and confused hem,so it's up to Sidney to find the killer before he kills again to find the truth,she will must to kill.Scream was the best movie when i saw hem years.Horror movie about the two high school student who kills like in the movie i love the ending where Sidney fought with Billy and Stuart and their plan and the game it was the best.I love both the sequels but they were no't good like the first.My opinion is the part one the best,part two good,part three the worst.The second sequel was the good little different but it looks like the same the first movie,first the name of the town was Windsor like in the first movie Woodsboro,then the victims were killed whit the beginning's names and surnames like in the first movie then was a copy killer on the end were like two killer but one won't get away other won't to be caught but was good movie i don't like third movie because was different than than first two but was great.Scream deserve legendary status too bad they don't do the forth installment.",10,0,0,3 July 2007
Wonder Woman," Garbage, pure garbage stinker this movie is horrible overlong and way too overrated
","*MAJOR SPOILERS* Before you read my review there will be a lot of spoilers for this movie and they are really a lot of honestly from a fan of superheroes like me.OK first it is not a DC thing and I don't hate every DC film that comes out, this movie was f***** terrible and it really sucked! This is the hype I don't understand and I don't know which movie is worse Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Man of Steel or this one? A lot of people hate to death Suicide Squad and say it is the worst DC movie that come out in my opinion I didn't mind Suicide Squad I thought was an okay time waster but wasn't that god awful horrible movie to me that's my opinion! Will Smith and Margot Robbie were good I liked those two. Wonder Woman is horrible f****** horrible mess it is way too long, too boring just like Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice both are horrible sh**y movies. The first day of watching I come to 52 min's of the first half then I had to turn off this movie and I had to continue next day and by the end of the fighting scene I fall a sleep so bad this movie was.I personally felt that this movie copied and stole the ideas from Captain America: The First Avenger I thought Gal Gadot imitated Captain America this movie tried to be Captain America: The First Avenger on a s***y way and it failed miserably! I also thought this movie stole and copied on the s***y way Thor when the villain on the end of the movie pops out and acts like a god and keeps talking about gods, I thought this movie stole scenes from Thor and make it in to one movie, sorry this is just my opinion. It is way too long, too boring, too overrated over the place. Gal Gadot sucks she is so terrible and one of the worst actress on the screen. Gal Gadot couldn't fake American accent and she was so terrible she didn't know how to act. I hated her in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and I said she was useless and wasted in this movie she is god awful make her stop she is terrible.I saw one of the worst fake CGI ever in the inter movie. Action and fight's? No they are all CGI the crap CGI all over the movie. The shootouts and gun battles in WWII are unrealistic you can see it is all CGI and it is not real. A Wonder Woman goes in to WWII and ends WWII and wins the war for us?! The writers for this movie must be a brainless morons you know it was Hitler in WWII the leader right? Here he isn't even mentioned at all these people must be really that dumb? Are people really buying this in this movie? The origin of this movie was pointless and over long over boring over dull over slow really slow paced. I hated the slow motion in this movie it was so fake that my eyes hurt.Gal Gadot is terrible awful she is so horrible crap actress for a lead she is horrible not just here but in the most of the movies I have seen her. In Fast & Furious movie she was so good that she was invisible to me. Criminal the only reason I watch it was Kevin Costner the movie was good because of Kevin Costner. She was horrible and god awful with her fake ascent and the worst part of the film for me. With her un tolerable dialogue I thought she didn't had the talent for playing Wonder Woman.This movie is a disappointment a failure and a let down and it stole scenes from Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor and yes those two movies were way better movies in my opinion.Personally I have nothing against lead actresses they are so many good actresses that are forgotten and they are better at acting then Gal Gadot: Amy Steel from Friday the 13th Part 2 and April Fool's Day much better actress then Gal Gadot she was better at acting then this sh**y god damn awful actress, did she get anything? nothing! Lar Park-Lincoln I liked her hell more in Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood way much better actress. Shawnee Smith in the Blob from 1988 did a great job was a strong character was a bad ass was a much 100 times better actress than Gal Gadot but did Shawnee Smith get anything? No. Heather Langenkamp from A Nightmare on Elm Street and New Nightmare she was much better actress I love Heather she is better then Gal Gadot and she did got nothing. Amanda Pays from Leviathan and The Flash is much better actress then Gal Gadot. Lisa Wilcox from A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master and A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child was much, much better actress way better than Gal Gadot! did she get anything? No. Gal Gadot got all awards but must of these actresses are forgotten and didn't get nothing for their work! She get's the praise for this movies while other actresses did not got anything! DC movies I think are better in my opinion: Superman I,II and III with Christopher Reeve, Supergirl, Tim Burton's Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever, The Dark Knight, Constantine, Green Lantern and Suicide Squad. DC Animated films: The Dark Knight Returns with Peter Weller Batman: Under the Red Hood, The New Frontier, The Flashpoint Paradox, Batman/Superman: Public Enemies, Justice League: War This movie can kiss my ass f*** this awful STINKER S**t movie F 1/10 avoid like a plague of this abomination!!",1,6,18,6 September 2017
Back to the Future Part II," Solid sequel in 'Back to the Future' trilogy dosen't deserve the hate my favorite time travel movie
","Back to the Future Part II is an solid sequel to the first one which Back to the Future (1985) is a masterpiece. This is a fun travel science fiction comedy in the trilogy. It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling with Time machine Car 'DeLorean' in to the future and back to the past again. This film is a 8 in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate, like mostly viewers stated. I love 'Back to the Future' trilogy it is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I grew up with this trilogy I have seen the first one on VHS as a kid. Years later I have seen the sequels on TV. I love this movie to death and it is my third favorite film in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong but I have enjoyed Back to the Future Part III more than part II and think the third film is the most underrated film in the trilogy and unappreciated. This film does have the comedy and the humor in it.I Love, Love this film so so so much, it is a great direction from Robert Zemeckis and brilliant writing from Bob Gale. Back to the Future Part II was nominated for an Oscar. I really did missed 21st October 2015 an important event date from this film in the trilogy that reached 30 year anniversary in the year 2015 when the trilogy come out respectfully on a Blu-ray. Back to the Future Part II (1989)The story continues when Doctor Emmett Brown, Marty McFly and Jennifer traveling in to the future 2015 to fix Marty's and Jennifer's future in which Marty has to save his son from been jailed. His arch enemy Biff Tannen steals Marty's idea and steal's Gray's Sports Almanac only to travel back in to the past November 12, 1955 to change the alternative time line paradox in which Biff creates the timeline in the year 1985. The same alternative timeline and paradox was also used in The Flash Season 3 Episode 1 Flashpoint. Than the story sets Marty and Doc on the hunt for a Gray's Sports almanac from Biff in the year 1955 in which Biff is a teenager. The chase and a race on the road in which Marty is in Biff's car try's to get the Almanac back and Biff crashes with his car in the truck of manure is my favorite scene in the film. The Hoverboard scene in the future in which Griff chases Marty in the year 2015 and Marty outsmart them in which Griff and his gang lands in the court in the opening scene is also my favorite scene in the film.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent in their performances. Michael J. Fox plays more than just one character, he even played Marlene McFly future daughter of Marty.Things I really didn't like about the film and that is why it hurts the film: the dark future created I didn't liked. I hated Thomas F. Wilson's character Biff trough in tier film he was irritating awful person. I didn't like the death of George McFly. I didn't like Biff marrying Loraine. Half of the film was more focusing on Biff than Doc and Marty I hated that idea. I did not like the filmmakers repeat the first movie again in the year 1955. They copied the first film I did not like that idea so sorry. I still hate Biff Tannen in this movie so damn much! I did not like the ending in which Doc was hit by a lightning with 'DeLorean' and sent back 100 year in the past. The film didn't had a satisfying ending or a happy ending that we wished for. I didn't like older Marty McFly he acted like he is stupid in the movie that is why I prefer III over this film more. Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover did not return to reprise their roles. I am surprised that actress Elisabeth Shue accept the role of Jennifer but she declined the role for The Karate Kid Part II weird. This film get's 8 'Back to the Future' is my favorite trilogy of all time and I love this movie to death. I hope they don't make Part IV because it will be disaster. It is rated PG for language throughout, some suggestive content and violence. I miss movies like this they don't make em' like this anymore.",8,93,109,4 March 2018
The Silence of the Lambs," Classic psychological, suspense brilliant - masterpiece best horror thriller ever made!
","The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is a classic psychological suspense brilliant masterpiece well acted and the best thriller ever made! This was my first film I saw on VHS as a teenager and I absolutely loved it. Right after seeing this flick, I heard about Hannibal (2001) Ridley Scot film a sequel to this psychological thriller flick, I rushed buying it right away. Saddly I was disappointed with Ridley Scott Hannibal.'Silence of the Lambs ' is a classic and I think people would agree. It is my number 1 favorite thriller ever made, mostly I have enjoyed Jodie Foster as FBI recruit Clarice Starling's. Jodie did a brilliant acting performance I have seen. I love this film to death I absolutely love everything about this film. Since the first time I saw her in Silence I went to seeing her in a movie theater 2002 Panic Room, it was her first film I saw in movie theater since than I love Jodie Foster but Silence will be her best film she ever made. I was disappointed with the sequel Hannibal, no Jodie Foster in it, no brilliant masterful Clarice. Julianne Moore was incompetent for me, she couldn't catch Hannibal. Clarice Starling character was based on Gillian Anderson's FBI Agent Dana Scully and I think The X-Files inspired this film. I am even convinced that The Lone Gunman three geeks were also based on this film. You have a nice shootout on the end with Clarice and Buffalo Bill and Clarice get's her man, spoils her plans saves the hostage and saves the day.The Silence of the Lambs is the 1991 thriller that was the feature film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris and marked the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) Dr.Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste (you can interpret that as you like). He is scary and his the same time awesome including brilliant, you can't out smart him. Director Jonathan Demme is masterful directing this flick you have to be brilliant you have to keep thinking to solve the murder mystery. Scott Glenn acts beautiful as Jack Crawford. This flick got five major Academy Awards ('Oscars' for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) it is no wonder why.Plot: FBI recruit Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is asked by the Bureau to elicit Lecter's help in tracking down a notorious serial killer who has kidnapped a US Senator's daughter. Directed by Jonathan Demme (The Manchurian Candidate), the film would receive five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Hopkins and Best Actress for Foster and Best Screenplay. Hopkins would reprise his role as Lecter in two more films: Hannibal (2001) and Red Dragon (2002).Real life killer Ed Gein was the inspiration for Buffalo Bill as well as the inspiration for Norman Bates from Psycho and Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. And the director Jonathan Demme was a film student of Roger Corman who makes a cameo in the movie. Roger Corman taught not only him, but I think other filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Joe Dante, Francis Ford Coppola, and many others. Ted Levine did a pretty solid job as a serial killer Buffalo Bill. This film is fun, intense, very well fast paced goes quickly around for those two hours.The Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 American horror-thriller film directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Scott Glenn. The film is based on Thomas Harris' 1988 novel of the same name, his second to feature Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. In the film, Clarice Starling, a young U.S. FBI trainee, seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter to apprehend another serial killer, known only as 'Buffalo Bill'.This movie is a perfect 10 out of 10, it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth (Jonathan Demme) with a brilliant cast including Thomas Harris novel that was adapted from it. I even saw the Documentary how they were shooting this film on YouTube. I think I do have that documentary film in my Blu-ray special features. Watch this film you want be disappointed at all. The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see for fans.",10,40,70,25 May 2016
X-Men: First Class," Entertaining origin comic book movie!
","X-Men: First Class (2011) is an Awesome Action superhero flick based on a comic book mythology of X-Men where it all begin. This film is close good as X2 it is my third best favorite X-Men film. I love this film! I love James McAvoy as Charles Xavier aka Profesor X later, I love Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique, I also love January Jones as Emma Frost and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lensherr alias Magneto. Gosh I love this film I was entertained from beginning till end. I love this movie, It is a great prequel to the X-Men movies James Mcavoy as young Xavier is great choice and everything of this movie is just Great.Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as Raven/Mystique I never saw her like that as been a good person, I always though she was bad. In First Class tells the story how everything was. How Eric and Charles become friends and later becomes enemies. The film is actually set from the first X-Men film when we see that boy in a Nazi camp in Poland it is the same scene from the first X-men Bryan Singer directed. X-men First Class is the best prequel movie that explains the X-men characters and their universe with a good back story. Vaughn struck gold casting McAvoy and Fassbender as Young Professor X and Magneto, these two stole the show, especially Fassbender as Magneto, he was amazing... X-Men First Class also had a great supporting cast with Kevin Bacon, Jennifer Lawrence, Rose Byrne, and January Jones. We are also introduced to a lot of new comers that played their roles perfectly.. The plot is pretty simple; we see how Charles and Erik meet and deal with their powers that they aren't comfortable dealing with because they are afraid society won't accept them, We also get to see how they eventually choose sides between good and evil! Which is very exciting, I know a lot of people (true Comic book readers) had issues with the actual choices of the First Class characters, but the ending of this movie will set up for those wanted characters to be in the sequel I'm sure, so hopefully the fanboys will ease up a little bit once production gets going on that! X-Men First class is up their as a top Comic Book movie adaptation and shouldn't be overlooked by anybody who is uneasy because of the past screw ups in the franchise. Just see this already if you haven't. I love this origin film, the acting in here is superb, the action scenes are awesome. I love that the plot I set in 1962, that you can see Las Vegas in here. I love that Eric and Charles are getting all the mutants together in battle against Sebastian Shaw. There is Beast for the first time in it. We last saw him in X-Men: Last Stand.Showing Magneto's strength and powers what he can do is amazing. Matthew Vaughn did an awesome job as director of X-men he did amazing job directing my all time favorite film Kick-Ass (2010.)X-Men First Class is easily the best of the entire series. The movie is high-tech and well-acted, with lots of action and noise as it portrays the origins of the X-Men, a group of about a dozen mutants (so far). It begins in a Nazi prison camp, where young Erik Lehnsherr is forced to witness a tragedy and finds he can control metals with his mind — but only when he's angry. He grows up to become Magneto and is played by Michael Fassbender, the lean Irish actor who the buzzmeisters say will become a big star from this film. Heaven help him. He was so good in 'Fish Tank,' 'Inglourious Bastards' and 'Jane Eyre' (2011): must he play Magneto to become a star? For that matter, Raven/Mystique is played by Jennifer Lawrence, just nominated for a best actress Oscar. Now she's a blue shape-shifter with scales. The price of stardom.I love the plot on how they blend those characters from the beginning till those moments where you should be like 'whoa its that it for him?' but its nice. Also I'm into the acting of the characters and damn kudos to Kevin Bacon & Michael Fassbender for just an awesome job on how they deliver the script into those characters. I mean just a big credit to those guys. The special effects are just awesome to the film as expected especially on the climax part. I love X-Men: First Class to death one of the best films ever made! Following the classic Marvel mythology, X-MEN: FIRST CLASS charts the epic beginning of the X-Men saga. Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together with other mutants some familiar, some new, to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known.X-Men: First Class is a 2011 American superhero film, based on the X-Men characters appearing in Marvel Comics. It is the fifth installment in the X-Men film series. It serves as a prequel of the franchise. The film was directed by Matthew Vaughn and produced by Bryan Singer. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Marvel Entertainment, Dune Entertainment Starring: James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence, January Jones, Nicholas Hoult, Oliver Platt, Jason Flemyng, Lucas Till, Edi Gathegi, Kevin Bacon Director Matthew Vaughn Screenplay: Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Jane Goldman, Matthew Vaughn Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 12 Mins.

The Dark Knight Rises," The third entry in to 'The Dark Knight' trilogy is still a good conclusion to an epic end
","The Dark Knight Rises (2012) is my third best movie. Anne Hathaway was awesome fantastic as Catwoman she portrayed her by comic books the way she was. Michelle Pfeiffer did not do the job by portraying Catwoman by comic books but she did knew how to hit back. Bane played by Tom Hardy was absolutely fantastic terrorist. The Dark Knight Rises is pretty good awesome movie! The third Christopher Nolan film is very bashed and criticized by fan boys of Burton films saying it isn't good as Burton Batman films were. I love The Dark Knight Rises a little much better than Batman Returns, but those 4. films I reviewed will be my four favorite films. Schumacher films suck and they aren't my favorite films. Anne Hathaway's performance is a worth of watch in this movie. Selina Kyle was written straight from the comic books the way her origins were. I love her in this movie she was well portrayed by Anne Hathaway, the way she was written in a comic books. Christian Bale still lighten us all up in his performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Matthew Modine and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a wonderful performances in their co starring roles. This movie still has a plot holes like Batman dies in the end but he doesn't, Bruce Wayne survives. Alfred disappears magically during half of this movie and he show's up on the end of the movie. Anne Hathaway did a much, much better job than Michelle Pfeiffer did. Bane was a scary villain but still a good comic book portrayed villain the way he was. Tom Hardy was truly great in his performance as the main villain Bane. Seriously I have enjoyed this movie much better as a I did Batman Begins. Still The Dark Knight is the best one of all Batman Films. A good conclusion to end the trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 British-American epic superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan, and the story with David S. Goyer. Featuring the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the final installment in Nolan's Batman film trilogy, and the sequel to Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008). Taking place eight years after the events of 'The Dark Knight', the film follows Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) once more as he is forced to come out of self-imposed exile when a new evil rises in Gotham. This time around, the Caped Crusader must face off against his most dangerous enemy yet, a ruthless masked crime lord known as Bane (Tom Hardy), who will stop at nothing to bring chaos to the city. He must also deal with the arrival of a mysterious cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), as well as his inner demons. He may have defeated the Joker, but does Batman even stand a chance against Bane?Eight years after the Joker's reign of anarchy, the Dark Knight is forced to return from his imposed exile to save Gotham City from the brutal guerrilla terrorist Bane with the help of the enigmatic Catwoman.It's hard to imagine a time when a Christopher Nolan-helmet Batman film wasn't a sure thing. Yes it does.Warner Bros. Pictures' and Legendary Pictures' 'The Dark Knight Rises' is the epic conclusion to filmmaker Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy.Christopher Nolan's concluding vision of the legendary Caped Crusader may just possibly go down as one of the strongest closing chapters to any franchise in modern cinema. Not only is it one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year, but it also expands upon the Batman saga in a way that keeps you both emotionally and intellectually invested until the very end. With its top-notch performances, breathless score, solidly engrossing storyline, and action-packed set pieces, 'The Dark Knight Rises' ends the franchise on a satisfying high note, delivering one of the most powerfully engrossing climaxes in recent memory. Anne Hathaway also deserves major props for her portrayal of the cunning Catwoman, who (in my opinion) is even more striking than Michelle Pfeiffer.Although 'The Dark Knight Rises' never truly reaches the same groundbreaking heights as its predecessor, I loved every minute of it. The fantastic storytelling, the gritty visuals, the brilliant character development. There's nothing here that isn't worthy of praise in my book. Nolan truly capped off his one-of-a-kind superhero trilogy in a way that no other director could've accomplished. Sure, the narrative can get a bit messy at times, but when compared to everything else the film does right, it hardly matters. I don't recommend this film , because it isn't for everyone. But for any fan of dark, gritty, action-packed filmmaking it is. R.I.P. to all the victims of the Theater Massacre in Aurora, Colorado. They will be missed.8.8/10 Score: A- Studio: Warner Bros.

Iron Man," Iron Man (2008) is the best original Marvel Action superhero film of all time!
","Iron Man (2008) is American Marvel Superhero Action film and the best one in the trilogy. It is my favorite best superhero film that I love to death!!! The film has awesome Action sequences, it is Entertaining with full suspense, it is intense and it is fast paced. The film is not boring or lame it is brilliant and awesome. You have to put brain in this film. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man did a wonderful job portraying a comic book superhero. I love the Action sequence, the Drama, the genius and brilliance of Tony how he was so brilliant as to build those missiles for Military but get's caught by the terrorists and he is hold as hostage in the caves of Afghanistan, against his will he has to build more missiles for the terrorist, but he builds for himself a suit and he escapes from the caves, he returns home. Tony shut's down the factory and than he starts building an red yellow armor suit and he turns him self in to a vigilante to an red yellow armored suit ultimate superhero 'Iron Man'. He goes back in to Afghanistan and destroys all his weapons and he defends the weakest people. He also has a blue heart in the chest because the shrapnel hits him. He finds out he was betrayed by his dad's partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who turns him self into Iron Monger on the end there is an ultimate showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane did a wonderful job portraying a super villain in this film. Gwyneth Paltrow did a beautiful terrific performance as Pepper Potts, Tony's assistant and his love interest. I love this film and is one of my favorite Marvel Superhero action films. Everything in this comic book film is in here. The CGI Iron Man are believable and terrific I have ever seen. They aren't bad, they are good. Jon Favreau did a wonderful and amazing job as directing this film and playing Tony's bodyguard as Harold 'Happy' Hogan the same time, that was amazing!! This film is brilliant I love how it shows Tony's tests scenes when he is building the armor suit, I love how Shows that Tony isn't self selfish centered jerk, he is a good heart person and he wants to do the right thing. To defend an innocent people from his weapons that he build and that his weapons got in to the wrong hands. It is an awesome how he redeem himself and how he had a conscious what was he done when he was building those weapons and how many people had to die. The original film is very good :) One hell of a film. The chemistry between Tony and Pepper is great, this film has a heart. The acting was great and the story was really good! This was definitely one of the best origin stories out there and the ending was fantastic! The fight scenes between Iron Man and Iron Monger was weary intense and awesome kick ass battle between those two super villains and heroes. I went into this film with an open mind and what we got, we got an fantastic comic book film. Paramount pictures sends a strong message to film comic book fans. So Iron Man is one of those movies. Jon Favreau did an amazing job of bring Iron Man to life. He so took the comic and make it look like we just watch this first time. The writing work so well with the actors with their roles. There's a lot of development into the writing and made relate to the comics. But of course the main that people loved this film is Robert Downey Jr. He killed it as Tony Stark and Iron Man. I couldn't see any other actor to take the role. He brings so much development and emotions into Tony and make you relate to him real easy. The rest of the actors did very well, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Palltrow all did an amazing job with their roles.After surviving an unexpected attack in enemy territory, jet-setting industrialist Tony Stark builds a high-tech suit of armor and vows to protect the world as Iron Man. Straight from the pages of the legendary comic book, Iron Man is a hero who is built - not born - to be unlike any other.Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures.1 It is the first installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was directed by Jon Favreau, with a screenplay by Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway. It stars Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub and Gwyneth Paltrow. In Iron Man, Tony Stark, an industrialist and master engineer, builds a powered exoskeleton and becomes the technologically advanced superhero Iron Man.Iron Man is one the most surprise and best superhero films of all time with it's great story, amazing acting and great writing. If you people want a fun superhero film, then this is the one for you. Iron Man (2008) is my favorite best Marvel Action superhero alongside Batman, Captain America, Spider-Man, Thor and Superman. I love this film to death. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Marvel Studios, Paramount Pictures Starring: Robert Downey, Jr., Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Criminal V Terrorist: Dawn of Toilets an insult to Batman and Superman superheroes
","*A HUGE MAJOR SPOILERS* Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is the worst I mean the bottom of the worst peace of sh** garbage, toilets stinker asshole awful horrible criminally superhero movie I ever saw in my life. I can not describe the words how much I hate Zack Snyder his Man of Steel and this movie which in my honest opinion an insult to DC Superman and Batman superheroes the two characters. I grew up watching Superman (Christopher Reeve) and Tim Burton's Batman (Michael Keaton) they were my favorite superheroes as child growing up. Smallville become my favorite TV show of all time as teen I constantly watched that show.This movie is so offensive that my eyes hurt. The worst superman and batman movie I ever saw! F*** Zack Snyder and his movies and his upcoming movies.I was the only schmuck, the only asshole who went watching Ultimate Edition that it is over three hours long. 3 hrs and 2.mins was so over long, over boring that I could not finish the movie. I had to quit after 1 hr of watching and go to sleep and watch the rest of the movie 2 hrs. the next day. Why I hate this movie to death: First over 1000000 people dies in this movie. I thought I watched terror attack on innocent people in this movie! Superman is a terrorist I don't care if theatrical cut is rated PG-13 I don't care. Superman kill's people with his little eyes he let's people die, he doesn't save anyone. He is selfish and all he cares is his stupid girlfriend. Superman must I mean must kill people why? really why. He kills doomsday he has to kill something so that he is Superman really? You know what we have DC terrorist as a superhero now. Henry Cavill is not Superman, he can not be Superman he can not act, he can't be Clark Kent he is a terrorist. Lex Luthor kills people and superman doesn't stop him and he dies on the end! Superman will and will always be Christopher Reeve and no one else. He can not be replaced. I love Superman I, II (Richard Lester version not Donner Cut) and III.Superman in this movie dies why does Superman has to die?, I did not want to see Superman dying and dead on the end of this movie!!! Superman has no remorse for the destruction he caused in the first movie. In the big fight he smashes Batman through a building causing the building to collapse. Ditto for Doomsday, smashes him in to a power plant of some sort. He is not even thinking about anyone's safety.Why is Doomsday angry with Superman? Since he is made from Zod & Luthor's genes, does anger/hatred towards someone pass through genes? There is again an apocalypse level destruction. Superman himself contributes to some of it. Thousands people are killed, but superman only saves Lois Lane like I was saying before he saves only his hooker bitch that's how I am going to call her. Superman is a pimp and Lois Lane is his hooker ha ha Superman threatens Batman that he can easily kill Batman, twice. Sounds a serial killer to me.<ul><li>- - - - - - - - </li></ul>Batman is a nasty criminal, Jezus Ben Affleck is awful as Batman he want's to kill Superman crazy. This is crazy I love Ben Affleck but I hate his character I don't think he did a solid job I think he was awful and he sucked ass! Batman steals, he steals and he kills people he uses guns, why does Batman uses guns? Why must Batman kill Superman? He kills people his suit is horrible this is not Batman I know and I grew up with it.Batman wants to KILL Superman just why? Because he was a menace and a terrorist to him we come to this far really? When the moment arrives, Batman stops him self, because his mother's first name is the same as Superman's mother's. And so they become the best of friends. Just like that.He dreams of gun battles in which he kills Superman's soldiers and when superman kills his army Batman screams!!! Why should I care about this movie when Zack Snyder has no appreciate to Christopher Reeve and Richard Donner's movie?! He thinks his Superman is the best, his superman is the king of comic books while Christopher Reeve is impostor and he thinks Superman killing people with his laser eyes is cool. Superman must kill people, he must let people die! This superman in here is a terrorist and batman is a criminal! Ben Affleck you suck as a Batman! I will rather watch Daredevil (2003) than this movie! This is the bottom of the worst movies. They can't make a good superman movies anymore! Zack Snyder Sucks!!!!!! DC you suck! This movie is the biggest pile of s***.This is a real disappointment the story is poor, it has no heart, no soul, adrenaline I can't root for those two, I can't mourn these two have no brains they are DUMB! The CGI are horrible the fight between those two is fake, oh and Wonder Woman sucks a dick, through inter movie I did not see her doing anything.Jesse Eisenberg was horrendous.For Superman I will watch: Superman I, II - (Richard Lester theatrical version), III and Smallvile TV show. For Batman I will watch: The Dark Knight, Batman, Batman Returns and Batman Forever.Captain America: Civil War was Billion way better and decent with heart and soul, than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice that movie was great and a real superhero movie.The rating 0 out of 10 I hate this movie it is brutal violent not decent offensive film DC sucks these days.",1,5,11,9 May 2017
Casino Royale," The best Bond i have ever seen, Daniel Craig's first best Bond 007 my third favorite
","Casino Royale (2006) is without doubt one of the best Ian Fleming's James Bond. This is the real film, the real Bond film unlike lackluster sh**y Die Another Day stupid movie! I have enjoyed this film so damn much! I love this film to death, from action sequence to actors and the plot story I love it. The film is very realistic serious well portrayed it has no jokes. It is my favorite because it is action, action, action and even more action. Casino Royale (2006) is the twenty-first spy film in the Eon Productions James Bond film series, and is the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel of the same name.I make no apologies for believing that Daniel Craig really did become the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. I'm a hard-core James Bond fan I love a lot of the films that over 50 years were made. Casino Royale is simply my third favorite James Bond film it is in my top 10 favorite James Bond films. This movie is interesting totally mind-blowing. It is highly entertaining, espionage with a lot of action sequence. Not boring or lame but believable well acted.After lackluster fiasco and disaster Die Another Day (2002) producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli fired actor Pierce Brosnan because he wanted too much money to shoot a fifth Bond movie, and producers had already decided to reboot the long-running spy saga with a grittier approach. Daniel Craig ultimately took over the role for 2006's Casino Royale and has gone on to achieve success as arguably the most popular 007 since the days of Sean Connery.Daniel Craig is fantastic as new James Bond tough I love Pierce Brosnan this is the real deal. Actress Samantha Bond also left James Bond saga after 4 movies since Brosnan was fired and this movie did not used Miss Moneypenny.Eva Green as the new Bond's girl Vesper Lynd did an excellent performance and a fine job playing James Bond's first true love. Green and Craig have electric chemistry on screen together. Vesper's character seems ambiguous, impudent and complicated. One night-slumped in the shower fully clothed, radiating inner beauty-her quiet look is capable to melt Bond's cold heart and free his doubtful mind. In another, she disconcerts him with her pretty 'Algerian love knot.Judi Dench as M is always awesome and she did a fantastic well done job. In GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough and this movie she did a well done excellent job. I love the actress and I had a blast watching her on screen.Mads Mikkelsen is the villain banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who tries to get rich in supplying funds for terrorists. The actor did incredible job as the main villain and I really absolutely loved his performance.Jeffrey Wright plays the new undercover CIA agent Felix Leiter 'bleeding chips at the poker tournament:' and Giancarlo Giannini plays the 'contact' Mathis.The Italian actress Caterina Murino plays Solange who reveals her sexy side as the frustrated woman so upset in her marriage.Armed with a license to kill, Secret Agent James Bond sets out on his first mission as 007, and must defeat a private banker to terrorists in a high stakes game of poker at Casino Royale, Montenegro, but things are not what they seem.Bond (Daniel Craig) is chasing a terrorist bomber Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) who was contracted by terrorist organization to make and sell a bomb. While Bond chases him he has to jump on a several sky cranes and on a building to continue the chase. Real stunt performance from stunt man and actor Daniel Craig. He chases Mollaka to embassy in Madagascar and shots him and shoots a nearby gas tank makes a huge explosion and flees with Mollaka's bag, he finds his cell phone with text message the word 'ELLIPSIS.' A trail leads Bond to Nassau, Bahamas to Alex Dmitrios (Simon Abkarian) in which Bond seduces his wife Solange and find's out he goes to Miami USA. Bond pursues Dmitrios to Miami airport kills Dmitrios with a knife in self defense tracks down another bomber. Bond stops the terrorist and takes the bomb away from the airplane. Saves all the passengers and the plane. Great tanker truck chase on the airport. Great action sequence Bond saves over 200 lives in this movie that is why I love it so much. Bond stops the tanker before hitting the plane with all the gas and the bomb attached to it and he attaches bomb on a terrorist. Excellent action sequence! Bond has to fight Le Chiffre in high poker game with Felix Leiter. Bond kill's two black men in which Le Chiffre lost their money and single handle with fists kill's them. Bond is such a bad-ass in this movie. Le Chiffre and his blond girl Valenka (Ivana Milicevic) poison Bond's martini with digitalis, causing Bond to suffer severe tachycardia. Bond runs to his car for defibrillator but passes out. Vesper Lynd comes and save's his life. Bond comes back in to Casino finishes the game and beats Le Chiffre at the game. Bond drives Aston Martin DBS great action sequence.10/10 This movie is directed by Martin Campbell who directed GoldenEye my all time favorite Pierce Brosnan 007 film. Casino Royale (2006) is my third favorite film in the Bond 007 saga and I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much!",10,160,188,25 November 2017
Speed," Will forever remain one of the greatest best action movies of all time!
","Speed (1994) is one of the best action movie ever made!!!! It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves action movies. I just wish they wouldn't made sequel because it doesn't even compare to the first one. Speed 2: Cruise Control can't hold a candle to this movie. For me the sequel never happened. I only own this movie in Blu-ray collection and that is all. I love the theme score in the beginning of the movie and I love music at end of credits. I just love this movie, alongside with The Matrix, Johnny Mnemonic and Point Break is one of my favorite action film of Keanu Reeves. This movie is one of those films that is worth of watch and money. It seems like now this days, action films force themselves into a wickedly strange plot to try to be the next sixth sense and put more money into each explosion than into any actors. This is a film that you just love everybody in the movie because the acting is great as well as the original story line. Sure, its no Oscar winning type of film, but if your at home looking for a fun film to watch, SPEED is the right movie for you. Keanu Reeves & Sandra Bullock's chemistry really made this movie work. This movies Is a badass! It is directed by Jan de Bont the same director who directed the god awful sequel. This movie is just great, it is Die Hard on a bus. Speed is simply similar to other sequel movie like are Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995) that come out one year later, when Sandra was handcuffed on the train and Keanu was saving her, the same cuffing scene was later used in Die Hard With A Vengeance. McClane been on a train that explodes and goes off the barrels out of an incomplete stretch of track and crashes, the same scene was used from this movie. Die Hard With A vengeance borrowed out some scenes from this movie including China Town line. I still love both of these movies, they are both great action films of the 90's and one of my all time favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Speed is a classic in modern terms and one of Keanu Reeves best performances. This movie had me on the edge of my seat from the opening scene. One of the iconic movies of the 1990's, Speed is a highly entertaining, slick and polished action movie. It's a benchmark movie of its genre that was high in tension and excitement without the unruly gore of a 1980's action flick. The story itself is very good; it has some important depth to it that missing from most action movies. The cast is rock solid; Keanu Reeves was perfectly cast as Jack Traven, a smart, agile but reckless police officer with a tendency to disobey orders and creates inventive solutions to get the job done. Jeff Daniels plays the sympathetic, wise polar opposite partner, Harry Temple, well. Dennis Hopper chews the scenes excellently as the charismatic and twisted maniac of villain. Sandra Bullock Annie couldn't be more likable and innocent. Joe Morton's character as the Chief is lively enough to support the lead and the rest of the cast is definitely solid.The movie is a near perfect one for me. It's like a minor terrorist who knows the police force and knows how to work w/ bombs which is really cool. Not only that Keanu Reeves makes an awesome cop and they have a great cast and supporting cast. Dennis Hopper makes a great villain, Sandra makes a great tough girl, and Jeff makes a great partner. I love the plot and the length of the movie. First starting off with a bomb on an elevator and then on a bus. And since it revolves around the bus ride the entire time they do a good job with adding little problems they must overcome to ensure the bus does not explode, such as sharp turns and getting on an unfinished bridge so they can stay over 50 mph.Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), an LAPD cop on SWAT detail, has a fearless nature and a keen understanding of the criminal mind. That, and some luck have kept him alive. But Jack's luck is being put to the ultimate test. An elusive bomber-extortionist Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) is seeking vengeance after his latest ransom scheme is thwarted. Payne gives a personal challenge to Jack: A bomb is rigged on a city bus, which will detonate if the speedometer drops below 50 MPH. Poor Annie (Sandra Bullock) gets shoved into the driver's seat, while Jack does his best to save the day.That is the basic plot, it is a slick film about a young cop who must prevent a bomb exploding aboard on a city bus by keeping its speed above 50 mph. and stop a terrorist by executing his plan. I am giving this movie a 10/10 it hell deserves it! I have fun watching it and I still love the score of the films. Great solid action flick of Keanu Reeves I love it!",10,70,81,15 November 2015
Live Free or Die Hard," Live Free or Die Hard is the best Action film of 2007 and it works for me
","Live Free or Die Hard (2007) is the last good Action film of 2007 in the Die Hard franchise. An old-fashioned cop emerges to foil a high-tech attack on the country's computer infrastructure as Bruce Willis brings back one of the biggest action franchises in screen history. It is one of my personal favorite action movies, it is a sequel I love to death.It's been over a decade since audiences last saw New York cop John McClane (Willis), but now, as the world's greatest criminal mastermind (Timothy Olyphant) attempts to cripple the entire country with an innovative act of technological terrorism, only one cop can insure that the integrity of the system stays intact. In this, the fourth installment of the long-running action series, Underworld director Len Wiseman picks up the torch formerly carried by directors John McTiernan and Renny Harlin to helm a script penned by Mark Bomback. Best Action Film Of 2007. Even with ratings PG-13 this film works for me. Those four movies of the franchise are the ones I love. When a criminal plot is in place to take down the entire computer and technological structure that supports the economy of the United States (and the world), it's up to a decidedly 'old school' hero, police detective John McClane, to take down the conspiracy, aided by a young hacker.Well, I can't believe I'm saying this but the newest edition to the Die Hard series may rank with the first. It's superb direction, fantastic acting, groundbreaking special effects and clever scenes, will leave you with (almost) nothing to complain about. Die Hard may very well be the best action flick of 2007. It can be beat, but I doubt by a sequel. I am proud to say that Bruce Willis still has some John McClane left in him. Bruce gets to say one of most famous lines in action film history, 'Yippy Ki-ya Motha ******!', without cuts, he even gets to talk to himself, a scene that is almost identical to the scene in the air vent of the first film. (C'mon, it'll be fun, come out to the coast, have a few laughs.) About all the controversy for the MPAA rating...it was all useless. Die Hard acts just like a rated R film, just because it says PG-13 doesn't mean its not as violent as the others. No, he doesn't say the F word, but it's not as bad as you think. It's more of a character to character type of thing then anything else. John McClane learns to bond with a young hacker. (Justin Long) It's more...I don't know...'cute' then the other movies, it doesn't need the F word. I don't think there is much else to say. Die Hard is one of my best movie experiences to date. The crowd laughed and screamed and then cheered at the end. The only slightest problem I had with this film was the fact that the realism was quite low. Then again, as I have said before, if everything were realistic we wouldn't have action movies. Live Free or Die Hard is a must-see FOR DIE HARD FANS.Live Free or Die Hard (also known as Die Hard 4: Live Free or Die Hard or simply Die Hard 4 and released as Die Hard 4.0 outside North America) is a 2007 American action film, and the fourth installment in the Die Hard film series. The film was directed by Len Wiseman and stars Bruce Willis as John McClane. The film's name was adapted from New Hampshire's state motto, 'Live Free or Die'.I loved the fact it's still Die Hard especially in the Unrated cut. the PG-13 didn't bother me he still told jokes, put a smile on my face gave his tagline & killed the bad guy. But my favorite scene is the Car Chase with the Chooper if I had to pick one. An enjoyable pop projection of post-9/11 anxiety. That said, it also makes you nostalgic for the days when irresponsible action movies didn't have to deal with it. Bruce Willis should not be the victim of facile stereotyping. He brings more heart and humor to apocalyptic pulp fiction than any other actor I can think of offhand. That film is great and the last good Die Hard film, A Good Day To Die Hard sucks horrible. Live Free or Die Hard is my favorite fourth film in the Die Hard franchise and this film, filmed in 2007 was great. 9/10 Score: A+",10,110,123,16 October 2015
X2: X-Men United," The Best X-Men in the franchise!
","X2 (2003) is the best sequel superhero of MARVEL comic book films! In my opinion X2 is the best superhero in the X-Men film franchise. This film is the bomb and it is my second favorite film alongside with X-Men, X-Men: Days of Future Past and X-Men: First Class. The effects are a lot of better than in other X-Men movies. The movie itself is great. I liked all of the X-Man trilogy a whole lot, but this one is by far my favorite!This was the only movie that I watch the last one of the X-Men trilogy, it is really awesome movie. I would say by far the best one of the X-Men movies far way better than First Class, Origins Wolverine, The Wolerine, X-Men and X-Men: The Last Stand, the third X-men movie. My favorite fight scenes were fight between Scott Summers Cylops and Lady Deathstrike the Asian chick. She way played by Kelly Hu, she was really hot. William Stryker played by Brian Cox was fantastic he wanted to find and kill all the mutants by using Professor X. This time Magneto escapes from jail he and Mystique join forces and team together with the X-Men to bring and stop common enemy together. This time battle begins in Canada. After Wolverine left for Canada at the end of the first movie to find answers about his past. Here he did not find anything about his past, in stead of that he found an underground that was Stryker's secret lab for torturing Mutants.In the first movie the final battle took place on Liberty Island in New York. In the second movie takes place the finale battle in Canada Alkali Lake. The third movie takes place the finale battle in San Francisco Alcatraz. The attack on Xavier school mutants academy was fantastic and how Wolverine killed most of Stryker 's men. Fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike was fantastic. This movie was really the best one. Wolverine did defeat Deathstrike at the end. I love this movie. Patrick Stewart is the best Professor Xavier. One of the best X-Men films ever made and my favorite team one, sorry Avengers but you got nothing on X2. The themes here are so awesome and are perfectly in line with X-Men, the character stuff is fantastic and the action was bad ass. The scene where Wolverines cutting through dudes in the X-Mansion was classic Wolverine. I loved the Nightcrawler in the White House so cool! I wish that I would go in the theater watching this film in 2003, by that time I just wasn't interested watching an X-Men movie, because I didn't understand the first movie, but I do now and It is my favorite superhero film now! I love Wolverine! he is a bad ass! Hugh Jackman is a great actor.X-Men set the standards far as how a great comic supposed to be. This movie is the best out of the 3. Entertaining, fast paced, great storyline. Even if you're not an X-Men fan you will enjoy this. X2 is the movie X1 should've been. The action, storyline and CGI were all improved. Just an overall better, more complete movie. I love this film and it is a bad ass film forever!!! The plot about this film is: The evolution continues in the next thrilling adventure in the X-Men saga. In the wake of a shocking attack on the President, the X-Men face their most dangerous mission ever. They must stand united with their deadliest enemies to combat a menace that threatens mankind... and mutantkind.X2 (often promoted as X2: X-Men United, or internationally as X-Men 2 is a 2003 American superhero film, based on the X-Men superhero team appearing in Marvel Comics, distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is the sequel to 2000's X-Men and the second installment in the X-Men film series.10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: 20TH Century Fox, Marvel Studios Starring: Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen Halle Berry, Famke Janssen James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos Brian Cox, Alan Cumming Bruce Davison, Anna Paquin Director/Story: Bryan Singer Producers: Lauren Shuler Donner, Ralph Winter Screenplay: Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris, David Hayter Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 13 Mins.

Lucy," A really good descent sci-fi action flick from Luc Besson!
","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a few action sci-fi leaps of faith, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off. Lucy (2014) is written and directed by Luc Besson and produced by his wife Virginie Silla. Just like The Fifth Element this movie is very similar to that movie, just it has a different story and different cast of actors in it. At least unlike Taken 3 This film is well shot and bloody. I adore Scarlett and she is an absolute delight to see in this. I just finished watching Lucy today and I like it. It was really good descent sci-fi action flick. In the beginning when Lucy talks to his friend Richard I thought the movie would be boring but it wasn't it was a hell off a ride. It went pretty fast and end well. I watched Scarlet Johansson in Captain America The Winter Soldier which in my opinion is the best action super hero movie for me. And in Lucy Scarlett Johansson did not disappoint me. Also Morgan Freeman was also really good. I enjoyed it ,it was fun and It is pure fantasy. Scarlett Johansson & Morgan Freeman carry this film, no doubt about it. But there is a story here ,what if we used 100% of our brain?? What would that be like , what would we be like?? Well for one thing ,things wouldn't be important, wars wouldn't be fought, racism would not be anything or wouldn't have started in the first place . You could think what you want on all of this, at least the film makes you wonder and that I find is fun. Lucy was like Inception and limitless combined with its intriguing premise and a film where u have to think more than a lot of other mindless films. every movie needs some sex appeal to make it realistic, film is the art of re enacting life....to some degree....I thought she was kick ass until her body dissolved. fortunately that was at the end of the movie. the small amount of sex appeal that she is given with this role is forgivable because her mind is transforming and everything is new, but I felt betrayed when she lost her ability to be relatable. I watch this movie twice it was fast paced and Entertaining action sci-fi flick! I really like Scarlett Johansson I was disappointed with Avengers: Age of Ultron especially on Scarlett's acting skills and her behavior during that awful movie. I think in 2014 were still some good movies that I like: I love Captain America: The Winter Soldier which Scarlett Johansson surprised the hell out of me on her performance as Black Widow including Chris Even as Steve Rogers and everyone should know that I love this movie to death. I like Lucy and I think of Luc Besson there are three movies that I like: Léon: The Professional (1994), The Fifth Element (1997) which everyone know I am crazy about that Sci-Fi action movie and this one Lucy (2014). I know the director made a lot of movies including La Femme Nikita (1990) but for some reason I never liked that movie, I don't know why, I just didn't. Or the series which Peta Wilson started it and later in new the series Maggie Q as Nikita. I just don't like those types of bloody movie and series. Those three movies I just counted are really good movies and I love them so much.Lucy is one of those high-octane films from writer/director Luc Besson that gives the audience a fun entertaining action extravaganza set piece but with a plot that is so far out there that its not so fun and entertaining to relate to, unless of course you happen to be tripping' along with the films characters. Scarlet Johannson, no stranger to the action genre brings her A game and Morgan Freeman's authority shines through but Lucy is as wacky as they come. Human mules may be a dose in reality but one where the in-jested drug makes you become one with just about everything is a little bit bizarre. Either way this one will either thrill you or beg you for a much better 90 minute high. The only thing that confused me so much of this movie is the ending which I don't get what happened with Lucy on the end of the movie. The end ended with a cliffhanger by the end if you ask me. I like that Luc Beeson tried to do something different than a straight revenge action movie - It was interesting and it kept my attention - I really liked the scene in the hospital when she was talking to her mother:)!!!! It was fairly decent overall. Wish it were a bit longer though because it seemed quite short. I am giving this movie a 10 because of Luc Besson, Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman as a science professor he did an outstanding perfect acting performance, he is awesome as always!!! Lucy is a 2014 English-language French science fiction action film written and directed by Luc Besson and produced by his wife Virginie Silla for his company Europacorp. 10/10 Grade: A Studio: Universal Pictures, EuropaCorp Starring: Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman, Amr Waked, Choi Min-sik Director: Luc Besson Producer: Virginie Besson-Silla Screenplay: Luc Besson Luc Besson Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 29 Mins.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An insult to a true fans - The Force Awakens is the remake of A New Hope!
","I hate bringing bad news to Star Wars fans, but this film is really terrible, It is A New Hope remake, It is boring, slow paced that I have almost fall a sleep. The movie copied and borrowed numerous things from original trilogy and ruined completely the previous six films. This REALLY WAS a remake of A New Hope. My jaw dropped (not in a good way) as to how much it rips off the first 3 films (to me, the ONLY ones). This movie has so much plot holes that it was just terrible. I am a fan of the original trilogy, not that prequels. I love A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back to death. I think they are the best movies ever made and a true classics, I like Return of the Jedi and I also like the prequels, I still can't believe how Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace are highly underrated.A person with the resistance puts info into a droid (who later escapes into the Desert)...said person fires on stormtroopers (like Leia did in that one movie in 1977)...gets captured, and later tortured by a Man in The Mask who is connected to one of our heroes by blood...while another person who won't tell Vader/Kylo information is killed (instead of choked, he's lightsabered and played by Max Von Sydow)... (Episode IV)A young woman in a desert finds a droid BB-8 wondering alone and she saves him who later has an important information. (Episode IV)Character Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a exact similar same copy version of Luke Skywalker. (Episode IV) The main hero is now a girl, the fate in the galaxy is now in a girl. (Episode IV) Then lead, who is a dreamer on the desert of Tatooine I'm sorry, Jakku comes across said droid...gets a sidekick (instead of Solo, it is Finn/Boyega) (Episode IV) A battle against Tie Fighters (instead of Han and Luke...it's the girl driving the Falcon and Boyega shooting. (Episode IV) Meets the 'old man who tells them about the Force aka Han/Ben Kenobi'...who is later Killed by Vader/Kylo, and even a close friend yells out and shoots (Episode IV) A scene where they meet a 'wise, tiny alien who knows a bit about Luke/the Jedi/etc.' aka Yoda I mean Maz (oh...and this is the scene where we get 'The Cantina Sequence...2015 style)...only to have an ending that blends Return of the Jedi and A New Hope.Returning the old characters from the original trilogy and than killing them off was never a good idea ever! Han Solo (Harrison Ford) returns not enters until 40 minutes run of the movie. Than you make and you kill Han Solo on the end of the movie (Episode IV) Character Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is exact same copy of Darth Vader, he copy's completely Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker).Kylo Ren is suddenly son of Han Solo (Episode V) because in Episode V was reveled that Luke Skywalker is the son of Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker) but in here Kylo Ren is the son of Han Solo.Carrie Fisher is gray, old and ugly now and doesn't even show any remorse or emotions when Han Solo is killed and he is killed in a fake CGI way been stabbed by her own son (Stupid).Why guys why did you had to kill Han Solo? He is definitely one of the most favorite beloved characters in the Star Wars franchise! Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) is suddenly happy when Rey sits in the Falcon and is the driving the ship. (Episode IV) The real Chewbacca would never do that, he would be sad and wouldn't let anyone driving the Falcon except him self.The X-Wings can go in to fight and blow up the Death Star...only it's BIGGER...while a lightsaber fight happens. (Episode VI) The X-Wing Battle in a very narrow trench to blow it up (Episode IV) it's the SAME THING! Than you have Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) returning in his role in a cameo scene, but he enters until 2 hrs long in the movie, he doesn't speak and doesn't do anything.Hell, they even have a version of the EMPEROR! The first time we see this guy (Snoke)? It's in a Hologram JUST LIKE IN EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (Episode V) (in case you forgot, the first time we see that character is via hologram, too)! Only the hologram is 100 feet tall or whatever the hell. (Episode V) Luke couldn't beat Vader his first time (getting his arm cut off)...it took him until the THIRD MOVIE to do the Jedi Mind trick...but this girl is able to do all this tricks after learning that the Force existed in 5 minutes! At least in Phantom Menace they didn't kill Han Solo (in such a awful way)...at least they didn't rip off A New Hope beat. At least The Phantom Menace had a cooler villain in Darth Maul (and a cooler weapon...Kylo's lightsaber is something I always thought looked dumb since I first saw the thing in pictures/trailers). And at LEAST Phantom Menace had some new music that was worth Duel of the Fates. This movie? I can't remember ONE SINGLE PIECE OF MUSIC worth. And I liked Ewan McGregor in those flicks...and this is coming from someone who did not like prequels.The original 3 are easily better...but yes, I can also say that REVENGE OF THE SITH is WAY better than this crap today. I didn't like Revenge of the Sith before but now it will get a second opinion from me. I will never watch any new Star Wars movies ever again. I am not the only one who is just disappointed and also upset. Terminator Genisys suffers the same fate as does this movie.This film gets 1/10 by me.",1,21,29,23 April 2016
RED," The best action packed DC Comic book movie!
","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take an action packed comedy movie filled with humor than ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Red (2010) is a great action packed comedy movie with humor in it. It is one of my favorite movies with Bruce Willis! This was the second movie that was based on DC comics I see of the duelogy. I always thought that Red 2 was better than this but I was wrong. This movie entertained me back and than, and I have enjoyed very much. This is one of the best movies you will ever see. It is way better than it's sequel Red 2. The cast is great, along with the plot. Very funny in parts and very serious in others. It's on both ends of the genre spectrum. If you buy this movie, I am 98% sure you will be extremely impressed. Some movies are works of art, but some movies are just fun to watch. RED is a fun movie. It taps into the baby boomer generation and may not be as much fun to the younger set, but I recommend this movie to anyone.I have enjoyed this movie so mu8ch. So many gifted actors willing to make light of their growing older. How could you not enjoy the interaction between Mirren, Freeman, Malkovich and Willis? Karl Urban (Star Trek, Bourne Supremacy) continues to show such versatility as an actor. No, there's not deep-seated truths about life here, simply a fun escape from reality. Definitely worth the viewing. There was a lot of action, comedy and great performances by the actors. The acting in this movie was believable and awesome. Karl Urban as William Cooper did an outstanding job! This is one of those that didn't really interest me at all when it came out in theaters. But after watching it twice in the row I was very impressed! The pacing felt draggy and the off-beat sense of humor felt too quirky for me. I was kind of bored and totally expected this. All of a sudden, BANG! The action erupts in the house and Bruce Willis is kicking their ass with his brawn and brains. The story really started to come alive and that''s only the beginning. The movie got better and funnier as it went along. The action sequences were surprisingly intense and bad-ass, there were some hilarious scenes that caught me off guard and the whole cast was terrific. From Bruce Willis' leading hero to Helen Miriam feisty female fettle that she plays so well to Morgan Freedman''s great typecast role to John Malkovich''s paranoid, trigger-happy C.I.A retiree that steals the show more than once to Karl Urban''s bad-ass wild card agent all the way to Richard Dreyfuss' cool mobster a-hole, they all deliver convincing, if sly, performances; they know what kind of movie they are doing and go with it. Not all of this is realistic and given level of limited plausibility and ridiculousness of the plot, this could have gone either way. But in all my surprise, this was a fun action-comedy with enough laughs and action to kill some good time over a weekend.Frank (Bruce Willis), Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich) and Victoria (Helen Mirren) used to be the CIA's top agents - but the secrets they know just made them the Agency's top targets. Now framed for assassination, they must use all of their collective cunning, experience and teamwork to stay one step ahead of their deadly pursuers and stay alive. To stop the operation, the team embarks on an impossible, cross-country mission to break into the top-secret CIA headquarters, where they will uncover one of the biggest conspiracies and cover-ups in government history.That is the main basic plot it has CIA agents in it and lots of actions, lot's of guns are used in here and the gun powder are great. I love this movie and it is a 10 for me.Red is the 2010 action comedy loosely based on the Wildstorm limited comic book series of the same name. Bruce Willis stars as Frank, a former CIA operative who has been designated by the agency as RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous). When he discovers that he's been targeted for assassination, Frank then recruits some of his former colleagues to find out who is behind the conspiracy. The film co-stars John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban, Morgan Freeman, Mary-Louise Parker and Ernest Borgnine.

Pitch Perfect," Pitch Perfect hits all the right notes!
","Pitch Perfect (2012) it is a musical comedy film and I love it so much. The same way that I love Bring it On (2000) which I love sport films and this is a team completion of a singers on a Capella University. Anna Kendrick is fantastic as Beca Mitchell who changes everything in the singing group. There is a lot of funny moments scenes, this film has a lot chemistry, it is a fun film and the music is good! This film is good I actually don't like music films they aren't my cup of tea. But this film is surprisingly good. I just watched in Friday Pitch Perfect 2 (2015) which was pretty good, I love it, I just love this film much more. Just recently saw this but I love it and have seen the second 3 times already. The singing is good and it's a hilarious movie. There's nothing more refreshing than when a movie pleasantly surprises you, and 'Pitch Perfect' does exactly that. We've all seen plenty of flicks in which a group of singers or dancers struggle with adversity and end up winning over everyone with their earnest performances.The formula hasn't changed here, but it manages to improve upon it with a hugely entertaining cast, some consistently unpredictable humor, and a series of awesome a Capella musical numbers. Everyone in the film is fantastic, but it's Rebel Wilson who steals the spotlight from everyone as the hilarious Fat Amy. If you thought her lines in the trailer were funny, just wait till you see her in full-fledged action. Anna Kendrick is also memorable as the film's down-to-earth protagonist, as is Elizabeth Banks in a small but enjoyable role as an a Capella commentator. But without a doubt, it's the enjoyable stage performances and impromptu sing-offs that make this flick so much fun to watch. The best battle is in the middle, when the girls go against the guys in a game of song tag. The only thing that sort of drags the movie down is the forgettable side story featuring Anna Kendrick and Skyler Astin, but at least it leads up to a sweet conclusion. With a solidly hilarious script and some phenomenal a Capella numbers, 'Pitch Perfect' is easily one of the year's most entertaining films, bringing together a strong, original, and eclectic cast with actual singing abilities. Sure, some of the physical gags do go a tad too far at times, but the flick's cheeky sense of comedy and Rebel Wilson's knockout performance make it all worthwhile.Pitch Perfect is Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story for the Glee set. Or the anti-Glee set even, and it's in that tricky middle that director Jason Moore's quasi-irreverent musical comedy sings. It's never quite the pitch-perfect genre it could be -- oh come on, you knew that one was coming -- but it pays just enough respect to raw talent, takes just enough cheap but affectionate shots at the collegiate singing competition circuit, and strikes just enough of a balance to emerge a full-fledged crowd pleaser. Add to that a well-cast ensemble that knows how to earn a laugh and belt a song and a series of a Capella arrangements primed to convert the unconverted, and you have a comedy that deserves a shot. I love this film to death it is my favorite film. Pitch Perfect is a 2012 American musical comedy film directed by Jason Moore. It features an ensemble cast, including Anna Kendrick, Skylar Astin, Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Ester Dean, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee, Adam DeVine, Ben Platt, John Michael Higgins, and Elizabeth Banks.10/10 Score: A Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Anna Kendrick, Skylar Astin, Rebel Wilson Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Adam DeVine Ben Platt, John Michael Higgins, Elizabeth Banks Director: Jason Moore Producer: Elizabeth Banks Screenplay Kay Cannon Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 1 Hr. 58 Mins.

A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) The best slasher horror film in The Elm Street series.
","I am written this review In Memorie of my all time favorite the best horror director Wes Craven that sadly is no longer with us anymore. On August 30th 2015, Craven died of brain cancer at home in Los Angeles. I am doing this for him. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American supernatural Classic slasher horror film written and directed by Wes Craven, and the first film of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. The best horror flick I have ever seen.I love this film to death, I love it!!! It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my number 1 favorite film in the franchise it stays in my heart forever. I am a big fan of this film I even have a poster hang on door in my room, my girlfriend give it to me as gift. I love some other films of Wes Craven that he directed like are New Nightmare, Scream, Shocker,The People Under the Stairs, Scream 2 and Scream 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) for me will be always in the genre the best slasher classic horror film written and directed by Wes Craven. He gave us Freddy Krueger which was followed six sequels one crossover and one remake after success of the first film that gross $26.505.000 in USA. The sequel after the first film A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge was refused from Wes Craven to work on the film because he never wanted or intended A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) to become an ongoing franchise (and even wanted the first film to have a happy ending), and also because he didn't like the idea of Freddy manipulating the protagonist into committing the murders. The sequel for me wasn't a good movie after the original was released. My top 5 films of We Craven would be A Nightmare On Elm Street, Scream , New Nightmare, Shocker and The People Under the Stairs. The first film is so original, realistic, and overall terrifying horror classic slasher flick that is actually happening in dreams, a sociopath child killer with sharp clawed glove who has knives in stead for a fingers, can enter into your dreams. If he kills you in your dreams, you're dead for real. The main protagonist is Nancy Thompson a teenager where her friends start dying and are killed one by one from Freddy Krueger, she try's to warn people from Freddy coming in to their dreams, but no one listens to her not her father the Sheriff not her mom or her friends. Her parents hold a dark secret from her long ago. She is alone in this and she has to fight him by her self by going back in to her dreams and get Freddy out of her dream in to the real world. Nancy the character was so clever, smart and intense carefully. She was awesome unique legendary heroine did you see how she put booby-traps for Freddy? Awesome!Tina Grey played by Amanda Wyss, is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. Heather Langenkamp is excellent in her role as the main protagonist in this film. She's legendary unique teen heroine a very attractive,and gives 100% as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger the actor's contribution to the character is 100% superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa, even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence, he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation: Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series, Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. For me Robert Englund will be the only Freddy Krueger I love him in all Nightmare films. John Saxon as Lt. Donald Thompson, Nancy's dad was fantastic in his role and his performance. Johnny Depp in his first role as Glen Lantz was awesome, I seriously loved him in 21 Jump Street TV Series and today I still love him in Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. I love the main theme Nightmare Freddy Krueger score from Charles Bernstein and I love the song at the of the credits Nightmare by 213.A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) is the best classic slasher film,one of the best horror movies ever made. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. My number one favorite horror film in the franchise and it will always be the best one in the series. I have always enjoyed seeing this film, it is fast paced, entertaining, not boring or over long film, but short and very intense from the beginning till the end. I love this movie death. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",10,111,130,13 September 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A good damn sequel of The Hunger Games franchise!
","The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) is a pretty good damn sequel and that a good one, I love it very much. The first hour was boring, the second hour when they were in arena and it was shown in an IMAX version was really pretty surprisingly, amazingly awesome and so very intense that you could not shut your eyes and not see what will happen next. Katniss killed one person and a few apes that was really pretty awesome for the second Hunger Games movie like was the whole movie Rocky II. IMAX version was at least 49 min shown. Katniss finally showed real feelings for Peeta and not just an act like she did in the first movie and trough whole 2.hrs in the second movie. That's what I thought the movie was so interested, that there was a real romance in it and not just an act. The second movie was pretty damn good but did not beat the first one. Francis Lawrence did a great directing job with camera shooting every each corner including an IMAX version making a perfectly shoot of every edge of corners. This film is actually brilliant and perfect. Jennifer is beautiful and Josh is amazing and I can't say anything for Liam he is just outstanding. My favorite film by far. I really enjoyed this movie I love the story. I did laugh when the old man whistle while Katniss was giving speech and got shot by the guards. I love it when they where in the jungle. I totally love this film, this was truly brilliant a masterpiece in my opinion. The thing that bothered me in this movie was the first hour was dragging too long and was boring, in the first movie The Hunger Games we are getting faster, but by this one takes too long and it ends with a cliffhanger for to see Mockingjay Part 1 & 2. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire begins as Katniss Everdeen has returned home safe after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark. Winning means that they must turn around and leave their family and close friends, embarking on a 'Victor's Tour' of the districts. Along the way Katniss senses that a rebellion is simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games (The Quarter Quell) - a competition that could change Panem forever.This film is great, it is as great as the first movie, but I still think the original film is better than this one, because the first movie has an happy ending, this one ends with a cliffhanger. What I love in this movie is sacrifice in the 75 Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are back thrown in to 75th Hunger Games and I love the team on the island and all dangerous in this island. I love this movie I love both of the movies, I own them on Blu-ray discs and I love them both so much. So they are both fun to watch and they do have joy in it. The key to the success of 'Catching Fire' is its steadfast adherence to the novel's central theme: Surviving the Games and leaving the arena are not mutually exclusive. The film takes us back to the dreary District 12, where Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) have literally and figuratively been set apart from the rest of the community. Their newfound wealth and luxurious homes in the 'Victor's Village' leave them physically isolated from those who continue to suffer and die under the Capitol's brutal regime; more importantly, their experiences in the Games have left them both with acute post-traumatic stress disorder. 'Catching Fire''s tone evolves smoothly from barely contained anxiety to foreboding to betrayal and even grim acceptance without the use of exposition -- a difficult feat for a film that is driven by action rather than dialogue. There is really no dead weight among the cast this time. Jennifer Lawrence (no relation to the aforementioned director) keeps shining bright as the reluctant Katniss, while Hutcherson imparts a level of depth to his character that was sorely missing in the first movie. Sassy Johanna Mason (Jena Malone), who uses her TV spot to curse at the Capitol audience, is a welcome foil for serious Katniss, and fan favorite Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin is awesome charismatic) wields a trident like nobody's business. Francis Lawrence made a wise decision in emphasizing the camaraderie that takes place in the largely tropical arena: It would have been a more difficult feat to distinguish this film from a watery version of the last had Katniss played the game alone. I am giving this movie a solid 10.The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a 2013 American dystopian science fiction adventure film based on Suzanne Collins' dystopian novel, Catching Fire (2009), the second installment in The Hunger Games trilogy. The film is the sequel to The Hunger Games (2012) and the second installment in The Hunger Games film series, produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik, and distributed by Lionsgate.

The Matrix," The Matrix Is one of the best Classic Sci-Fi Action Film ever
","My review of the best epic Science Fiction Action film, The Matrix (1999) starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong and Gloria Foster.This was be the first movie I went to see in the movie theater with my mom when I was 15.years old, when I read in the magazines about The Matrix I was blown away and I wanted to see it right away. The Matrix is the best action sci-fi films that Keanu Reeves made in the 90's. It is one of my personal favorite movies. The Matrix is a (1999) American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called 'the Matrix', created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer 'Neo' learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the 'dream world'.Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, this classic sci-fi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence, and that of all mankind, is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this - The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience, least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne-Moss, Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix, he can control, bend, and manipulate space-time... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen. The slow-motion 'bullet-time' effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range, his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think, makes you gasp, and makes totally forget where the 136-minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels, and dozens of copy-cats. The Matrix, 'Visually revolutionary, and mind-blowing.' Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. He also played the roles in Underrated Daredevil (2003)and Bad Boys I & II. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor. Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopia atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 16 years later (my God has it already been 16 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The film also won 4 Academy Awards including for best visual effects. 
10/10 for one of the best epic American science fiction action film's in the history movies like this and Aliens (1986) don't exist anymore. It is one of my personal favorite movies, it is the movie I saw with my mom in the movie theater it is memories on my mom who is no longer with us anymore and I miss he.",10,72,96,30 July 2015
Heat," Action masterpiece Michael Mann, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's best favorite heist movie of all time
","A masterpiece and one of the best action heist movies of all time! Heat (1995) is one of my personal favorite Al Pacino and Robert De Niro Action heist movie of all time! I love this movie to death! This movie has everything, action, drama, heist, great cast and incredible realistic great performance from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro! Provides fast and loose action with interesting characters. Great action movie!!!! One of the best for me!!!!!!!!! To this day this movie stands a classic action heist movie of all time! Acting, story, score everything in here is excellent! This movie has a great plot, brilliant story about two lead characters a professional master thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) battling Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective in this non-stop race against time heist. Michael Mann did everything with this film, he wrote the screenplay, produced this movie and directed it. Michael Mann is a brilliant director I love Miami Vice TV Series, Manhunter and Collateral. This movie is the real heist movie un like Point Break and Baby Driver this movie deserves a 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors and great stunts. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.Al Pacino stars in the film as Vincent Hanna, a relentless lieutenant in the LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division who is determined to take down a high end robbery crew led by master thief Neil McCauley (De Niro). Notable for its detailed depiction of the techniques used by both law enforcement and criminal elements, as well as exceptional and accurate gun handling, the film was first made as the 1989 television movie L.A. Takedown. Heat also was reported to have been viewed repeatedly by the 'High Incident Bandits' robbery duo involved in the infamous North Hollywood shootout (as depicted in the film 44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shootout). Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective was a great character cop. He was at least MILES way better than Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) FBI rookie Agent in Point Break that movie sucked! Lt. Vincent Hanna shoot and killed Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) and he saved a child. He cracked the case and he figure it out who the mask robbers were. In the climatic epic battle fight on the end of the film on the airport field he shoot and killed Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). He destroyed and hunt down McCauley's crew. True two got away but he always got his man. He at least didn't let go McCauley like Johnny Utah did, letting go Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and he did not arrest or shoot or kill any of Bodhi's men he let them all go. Lt. Vincent Hanna is a hero and veteran police officer to me. Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), as a professional thief was smart, intelligent, high profile criminal with no criminal record. He was the mastermind behind the robberies, he knew what he was doing. He was a murderer and he did what he know best. He at least wasn't like stupid dumb idiot Bodhi from Point Break, he was trying to get away but he always settle a score with everyone that double crossed him. It is wrong to messing with him. By the end that way leaded him to his end, he made a mistake when he went after Waingro (Kevin Gage). The movie has also one of the greatest shootouts in L.A. in which Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) McCauley (Robert De Niro) firing Colt Model 733 automatic riffle on the cops. Great shootout's I love it. The movie has great famous cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Ted Levine, Dennis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Natalie Portman, Tom Noonan, Kevin Gage, Danny Trejo, Hank Azaria, Martin Ferrero and Xander Berkeley a lot of famous actors and actresses were extra in this movie. The movie focus on a real human characters that they are ordinary people with normal life's like you and me. That is why I love this film to death! It is realistic performed and it has no jokes or fantasy or anything it is real life. I love Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's performance they both fit the task and accomplish their acting their characters. Heat is the 1995 crime drama directed by Michael Mann and marked the first on screen pairing of legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.10/10 My all time personal favorite action heist masterpiece Michael Mann film of all time, this movie kicks ass.",10,124,152,7 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A classics, phenomenal and arguably the best sci-fi flick masterpiece!
","Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) is a classic phenomenal arguably the best sci-fi film in trilogy away, the one that started all and arguably changed the face of cinema forever. I love this film is actually my number 1 favorite film in the franchise and it is George Lucas masterpiece - the man who make this film happening. He wrote and Directed him self, I love this film to death! I love everything that is in A New Hope. Before I go in to this movie I want to say after watching the new awful horrible movie Episode VII The Force Awakens, I decide to re watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and I have always loved A New Hope and I always will. This was the first film in the trilogy that I have saw as a kid and that I remember. Star Wars are starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.The plot is actually more about Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. It is a mission returning the plans of Death Star to the Rebel Alliance, while Galactic Empire want's them back and it is lead by Darth Vader (David Prowse). This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and Special Effects.Star Wars is a film that I have watch it now and I will always watch it , because how much I really, really enjoy this film. This fun, pure joy, entertaining and truly a great film is like a classic, I recommend this film to any fan of the Star Wars trilogy, my favorite will always be A New Hope. This was the film that I have saw the first time as a kid and it grow on me. I love introduction when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking trough the desert on planet Tatooine and are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. Here is the first time we met the character Luke Skywalker. This is the scene where C-3PO is walking trough the desert him self and than he saw someone far away and yells for help. I love this scene and it is the scene I remember from childhood.Which is your favorite character? My favorite character of all time is Luke Skywalker and I really love him so much. My second favorite character will be Han Solo but Luke Skywalker will be the ultimate hero of the galaxy for me.I love this flick, I love the end battle on Death Star, Luke joins the Rebel assault squadron and Luke becomes one of the few surviving pilots. Vader leads a squad of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Luke's X-wing fighter, but Han returns and fires on the Imperials, sending Vader spiraling away. Helped by guidance from Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke uses the Force and successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the Rebel base. I love that scene.I love John Williams score for Star wars which is the best score ever! It is an excellent score makes an actions scenes more exciting and more intense. George Lucas directed this movie well and did an excellent job been a writer as the same time been the director, the pacing is excellent the actors does an awesome job. I also love and I have enjoyed the character Darth Vader and I also love this film because it has a happy ending. Harrison Ford , Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher did all a great joy playing their characters.Carrie Fisher is really gorgeous in this film and for the 70's film it had great pacing and great imaginary story that dose not gives you only a snippet of the backstory. The fight scene between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan 'Ben' Kenobi was excellent and the death scene of Obi-Wan was a honorable death. Alec Guinness did a perfect job as Obi-Wan 'Ben' Kenobi he is excellent. Overall: I have said everything about this film that I love I forgot to mention I love Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker (I love to death), Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2. This flick get's a perfect 10 because it is the best beloved science fiction film.R.I.P. Carrie Fisher (1956 - 2016) she was the perfect Princess Leia and she is very missed.",10,161,185,23 April 2016
Deadpool," Way too violent, offensive brutal action movie and overrated
","*SOME SPOILERS* What can I say this MARVEL movie is way too violent, way too offensive and really brutal action movie rated-R it is not for kids. The movie has really strong language, they are making fun of the movies and they are joke about it, has a lot sexual scenes and it is just not kind of my movie. I can't say it is a bad movie or it sucks it is just not my couple of tea, maybe I am going to change my opinion some day who knows. It think it is honestly one of the worst superhero movies and I just think it is way too overrated and over-hyped. I mean I don't hate the movie but I don't like it either. I never read the comic books of Deadpool I know Ryan Reynolds Deadpool from X-Men Origins: Wolverine and that is it. I am not fan of Deadpool and I never will be. NOTE Important for kids: The kids should really stay away from this film it is not a superhero it is more a real cold brutal violent action movie. You have a torture in here and Deadpool hurts people the villains really uses people as their lab rats and mutation it is gross. In my opinion it is an insult to MARVEL fan and young little kids. Deadpool doesn't save anyone he is a selfish asshole! Ant-Man is miles way better movie than Deadpool I enjoy that movie more it has a heart and it has a redemption this movie has really nothing that I have found enjoyable.The film copy's scenes from Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Men In Black, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Daredevil. It starts well and then by the first hour goes down hill I hated sex scenes, I hated Ryan Reynolds character joking trough whole film and pointing guns on people I don't like Deadpool killing bad guys, I don't like the bad mouth language the swearing words I don't like it. Too much CGI of gory death scenes, I don't believe the fight scenes are good. I don't understand the plot like what was Ajax doing in some faculty torturing sick people? The movie is terrible to me.I never heard about Negasonic Teenage Warhead she was never mentioned in X-Men movies and where are other X-Men members? they are not in here. Ryan Reynolds is also quoting lines from different movies.Only three things I did like in the movie are: The song playing in then opening scene from Juice Newton - Angel of the Morning it is a good song they could have used in the end of credits but they didn't. The only good thing about this movie is Ryan Reynolds the only positive thing I think he does a solid performance and excellent job the rest of the actors are meh and a huge pile of s**t!Wade Wilson got diagnosed with brain cancer that was serious and we see how hard and rough his life is going. That wasn't a joke my uncle was really diagnosed with cancer and he died 8. months later so that was really portrayed.That's all I like there is nothing much too talk about this movie the ranting I am giving a D 4/10 I am speechless.The MARVEL movies I more enjoy than this movie: Captain America Trilogy (First Avenger, The Winter Soldier and Civil War), Ant-Man, miles way better movie than Deadpool, The Punisher with Thomas Jane in the role, The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Iron Man 1,3 and Spider-Man 2, Daredevil I still have to re watch, Blade 1,2 and even Blade: Trinity with Ryan Reynolds in it I enjoy more than this movie.I enjoy action movies who are better to me than Deadpool: Rambo films,( Rambo IV is brutal but is way better action movie than Deadpool), Demolition Man, Cobra, Tango & Cash, Cliffhanger, Assassins, Hard Target, Hard Boiled, Broken Arrow, The Killer, The Last Boy Scout, Die Hard franchise, Commando, Red Heat, Missing In Action 1,2, 48 Hrs. , Steel Dawn, Road House, Black Dog, John Wick, Speed, The Matrix Trilogy flicks, Terminator 1,2 & 3, Predator 1,2, RoboCop 1,2, Beverly Hills Cop 1,2, Death Wish 3, Universal Soldier, Cyborg and many more action movies that are all better.

Fast Five," Definitely the best Action flick in the series from 2011
","Fast Five (2011) is one of the best Action heist films of all 5. film series of all time. This film reunites all actors from the previous films. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster , Tyrese Gibson , Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Matt Schulze, Sung Kang, Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, Tego Calderon and Don Omar, the gang are all here! They are all cast from the previous installments. 
The Director brings all new actors in the cast crew: Joaquim de Almeida, Dwayne Johnson and Elsa Pataky. The script, the players, the action scenes, the story. Everything about this film is awesome! This film kicks ass. Is my second favorite best film in the series franchise. This film for me even beats Furious 7. Cause Furious 7 is not that good as this film is. The far of the highest best films ever. It's actually probably my favorite movie that I've ever seen. If you like any of the other fast and furious movies SEE THIS ONE!!!!! It's a Epic movie watch it till all the way to the end.Fast Five picks up, literally, right where Fast & Furious left off. Dom (Vin Diesel) is on his way to prison when his partner, former undercover detective Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) stage a daring (albeit highly unlikely) prison-bus break. On the run from the police, the FBI and the media, the three hightail it across the border and head even further south, all the way to Rio de Janeiro. There, they decide to lay down, lay low and avoid any unwanted attention. Nah, I'm just kidding. They do what any international fugitives would do: rob a train, double cross a local crime lord named Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and his right-hand man Zizi (Michael Irby), put themselves on the radar of a ludicrously musclebound U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent (Dwayne Johnson), and set out to steal untold millions from Reyes. That's right, it's One Last Heist for Dom and Brian. Not that anyone should be foolish enough to think this is the last we'll see of the led-foot duo; not after Fast Five revved up $600 million at the worldwide box office. (Be sure to sit through the first chunk of end credits for a nice little surprise.) Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean, well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit, making the film's running time breeze by. The heist in Rio De Janeiro was amazing An energetic, high-octane. The film was brilliant and smart it was action fun Entertained. The fight scenes between Dwayne Jonson and Vin Diesel was tremendous. I was happy that they put someone (Dwayne Jonson) in the movie that was so smart like Dom (Vin Diesel) was. Luke Hobbs as A Diplomatic Security Service agent to track down Dom and his crew was awesome! He did a brilliant job In this Action packed sequel film! Just Lin deliver us a high octane Action packed story filled with full of cars and shootings in his film.Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead this all-star all-action movie with outrageous stunts, incredible cars and beautiful girls that pushes the limits into the red and beyond! The legendary Dom Torreto (Vin Diesel) partners with outlaw cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) on the opposite side of the law in exotic Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Hunted by ruthless Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and an army of corrupt cops working for a deadly drug kingpin. Torreto and O'Conner reunite the gang from previous Fast adventures to pull off one last job - an insane heist worth $100 million! 'Five Times The Action!, Five Times the Fury!' I love this film to death and I love how they were planning to rob a Police Station. The first half was a little boring, but the second half was fast paced entertained filled with action. I love this film and everything about it. I love that it is 2.hrs long so that it can tell the whole story.When developing Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100 million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.",10,110,122,18 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Excellent timeless classic, the best sequel of all time!
","Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. It's great because Darth Vader and the Empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as George Lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.The plot is actually more a rescue mission that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is coming to rescue his friends Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca are captured on a planet Bespin in Cloud City from villainous Darth Vader. Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) set the up and with Darth Vader he set a trap for Luke. Also Luke studied the Force under Jedi Master Yoda to become a full Jedi Knight but in the end he must confront Darth Vader (David Prowse) by him self. The origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled.Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980 it is directed by Irvin Kershner this time and not George Lucas. Because George Lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. Getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in Orange County, California, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct Empire Strikes Back. So his first choice was Irvin Kershner, who was a professor at UC in the UC film school, that George attended too and he always liked Irvin Kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time Irvin Kershner didn't want to do it, so George called Irvin's agent and his agent said to Irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. This stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! I love John Williams score still the same, but I think John Williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion.Things that I love in this film: I love the battle with Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth. That is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. The Imperial AT-AT walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.I love that the origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled, that Luke is the son of Darth Vader, who is actually Anakin Skywalker, before he become Darth Vader and went to the dark site.For the first time ever, we see an Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader.The Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.Luke faces with Darth Vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. The lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between Luke and Darth Vader was excellent and it was epic.The training sequence with Luke and master Yoda were excellent and epic. A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are my favorite films in series, that are in the franchise, this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time.",10,180,202,25 April 2016
Sin City," Frank Miller's best masterpiece ever!!!
","Sin City (2005) is one of the best comic book Frank Miller's thrillers ever made! It is one favorite best Bruce Willis movies. He just rocks in this role as Detective Hartigan! I just wish his character had a better ending. Great directing, acting and action throughout the movie. Amazing how the movie ties together, plot is perfect. The variety of characters in the movie diversify the story so well and not the mention the characters are very believable and played well. Definitely a must see for all Tarantino and Miller fans. This is the best movie ever made from the year 2005, it is been 10.years since this movie was released. 10 year anniversary and is still one the best entertaining thriller movies ever made. I just love this movie and everything in it. The movie is fun and it is a joy to watch and you can never get bored. It is a Frank Miller's masterpiece and one of the best graphic novel! The best movie delivered from three directors Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. The movie has full, I mean full of famous actors in it. Everybody does a great job. The acting in this movie is realistic and really awesome! This movie can satisfy audiences that either want a simple fight movie along with those that want to look deeper and find an intricately woven story beneath. The numerous stars in this movie all go on to create unique characters that case viewers to actually care if something bad were to happen to them. Being based off a graphic novel, it also stays true to the original formula while being able to be easily viewed by those that have never read the graphic novel. The styling and art of the movie are both is interesting but also don't distract from the movie itself. The fight scenes stay vibrant and fresh and throughout the course of the movie, events seen in one part have unique and interesting ways to appear or connect in other scenes. Bruce Willis stars as a cop with a bum ticker and a vow to protect a sexy stripper (Jessica Alba), Mickey Rourke as an outcast misanthrope on a mission to avenge the death of his one true love (Jaime King) and Clive Owen as Dwight, the clandestine love of Shellie (Brittany Murphy), who spends his night defending Gail (Rosario Dawson) and her Old Town girls from a tough guy (Benicio Del Toro) with a penchant for violence. Also starring Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, Michael Madsen, Carla Gugino and Michael Clark Duncan.That is the main plot about the movie. It has more story's to tell and it also has action in it. Even for black and White color movie it takes the vision of the most imaginative directors on earth. The film itself is outrageously entertaining. Director Robert Rodriguez does a masterful job with Frank Miller's material while also bringing filmmaking to a whole other level. This along with a spectacular cast makes this one of the best films of the past 10 years and one of the best graphic novel/comic adaptions. The biggest surprise of Sin City is that I enjoyed it.. a lot and Robert Rodriguez was one of the directors! Sin City gives us Four different stories with multiple different characters doing their parts in many different ways, we are given a Pulp Fiction type movie that has a grand finale and draws the audience into each and every tale told. The cast in this movie is superb! we have actors like Bruce Willis, Nick Stahl, Jessica Alba, Powers Boothe, Benicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke, Michael Duncan Clarke, Rosario Dawson, Carla Gugino, Josh Hartnett, Brittney Murphy, Jaime King, Clive Owen, and Elijah Wood. all these actors have their moments to shine and nobody overlooks another. They all handle their roles beautifully in this. The artistic view in this movie are like something we haven not seen in the movies ever. Frank Miller wanted his 'baby' to be exactly like his Dark Comics and RR did just that. The movie is in Black and White with certain colors brought out in certain scenes. Now when i say Black and White I am not talking about your regular B&W movie, imagine a comic book page taken out of the comic and placed onto the big screen. The whole movie looks just like that, and its AMAZING! This movie is a perfect 10, the greatest thing about themovie is the theme that is just awesome.Sin City (also known as Frank Miller's Sin City) is a 2005 American neo-noir crime thriller anthology film written, produced, and directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez. It is based on Miller's graphic novel Sin City.10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Dimension Films, Troublemaker Studios Starring: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood, Alexis Bledel, Nick Stahl, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Powers Boothe, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King, Rutger Hauer, Carla Gugino, Michael Clark Duncan Directors: Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino Screenplay: Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez Based on Sin City by Frank Miller Producers: Elizabeth Avellan, Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez Rated: R Running Time: 2 Hr. 04 Mins.

Mad Max: Fury Road," Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015. Mad Max: Fury Road is the finest blockbuster of 2015!
","When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. At least it wasn't so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time. I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller's masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn't I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn't even noticed that we don't have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it. NOTE: 'Don't waste your time if you have seen the original.' from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015! Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce commodities.10/10 Awesome film I have seen it twice. I love this film to death I love it! Fury Road would be the second favorite best film in the franchise.",10,224,336,3 October 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The best awesome action science fiction flick in the series!
","Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) was big improvement over Revenge of the Fallen and it is really better than the fourth one. I love this movie to death. It is my second best favorite Transformers movie in the series. I enjoy this movie so much and I just wasn't bored. I have enjoyed about anything that has to do with big robots and even bigger explosions! I know people will disagree with me and put my review down, but this movie was OK and it was far from disappointment! It was Miles better than Revenge of the Fallen and Age of Extinction those two movies were just awful horrible. This one was just big improvement over the second one and the next fourth one sequel. I could really got in the story. It was about Autobots who found Sentinel Prime Optimus the last predecessor and the leader of the Autobots, who later betrayed Optimus Prime and Autobots by making ages ago a deal with Megatron, he formed alliance with the Megatron and Decepticons who wanted to re build Cybertron with pillars that could open a bridge through space and time on our planet and enslave all humans on our world. Together with Megatron they would rule the planet and all Autobots would be exiled from the planet Earth. Sam and Autobots must fight once again. I love the music that they put it in this movie, action and I like the scene with Patrick Dempsey and Sam fighting each other, that was GREAT! Other than that though, as far as entertainment and emotion goes, this was a perfect movie. CGI of robots were good, they weren't bad. I know everything about this movie what is about. It is the last good Transformers movie and the last time we see the crew from the previous movies together. The action was really great, I love the action scenes, the explosions and the story, the plot about this movie isn't terrible or confusing at all, it is good. Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky did outstanding job as always it is the last time in the movie we see him. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly Spencer did a wonderful performance as Sam's new girlfriend. She wasn't annoying, or such a bimbo diva like stupid shallow Megan Fox, she was beautiful and her performance was outstanding. She wasn't hot, she was convincing actress and I didn't thought anything bad about her. Thank god for Michael Bay replacing Megan Fox with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, I am so glad Megan was gone. Rosie was miles way better than Megan Fox was. John Turturro as Seymour Simmons did a fantastic job portraying once again his character, he gave us an outstanding performance. Patrick Dempsey as Dylan Gould as the main antagonist did an outstanding acting performance as the second villain and Megatron's second in command henchman. This is the second time Patrick Dempsey reunite and work together with Ehren Kruger. He already worked with Ehren Kruger on the third slasher horror film Scream 3 (2000.Critics are way too hard on Michael Bay! He has said himself that he just wants to make crowd-pleasing movies, and 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' has done exactly that! This film has made 1.1 BILLION dollars at the box-office; and for a good reason. So what if it doesn't have Oscar-worthy performances, and had a few bad jokes here and there. I LOVE those two movies. And the fun part about the latest entry in the series is that I actually did find something deep with it. This film had several emotional moments, and I found myself welling up with tears. And the fantastic score by Steve Jablonsky fit in very well with it.The movie had a lot of mistakes and holes that I didn't understand. I thought the mythology of the Autobots was already explained in Transformers (2007). Megatron and Shockwave did not had enough screen time in here. The blond women Frances McDormand as Charlotte Mearing Director of NSA was annoying, she annoyed me too much. She blamed Optimus Prime for Sentinel Prime destroying NEST's base and making off with the five pillars. She had no respect to Autobots at all. They saved Earth twice and that was a big thank you for it. I did not like that. When the shuttle Xantium rocket was shot down and destroyed by Starscream, in which one of the booster rockets where the Autobots hidden? Because I only saw one rocket taking off in the air and not two. And in what Ocean the rocket fall? And how did the Autobots come back from water if they can't swim and than they mystery appeared in Chicago so soon, this confuses me so much. A mysterious event from Earth's past threatens to ignite a war so big that the TRANSFORMERS alone will not be able to save the planet. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and the AUTOBOTS must fight against the darkness to defend our world from the DECEPTICONS all-consuming evil in the smash hit from director Michael Bay and executive producer Steven Spielberg. That is the main plot of the third entry of the action sequel science fiction film! The rating of this film I gave is 8/10 this film deserves it! Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a 2011 American science fiction action film based on the Transformers toy line. First released on June 23, 2011, it is the third installment of the live-action Transformers film series. 8/10 Score: B+ Studio: Paramount Pictures, di Bonaventura Pictures Hasbro Starring: Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand Director: Michael Bay Producer: Don Murphy Tom DeSanto Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Ian Bryce, Steven Spielberg Screenplay: Ehren Kruger Based on Transformers by Hasbro Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 34 Mins.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The third entry in the installment is one of the best Indiana Jones series.
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. I loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy's dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit & charm along with Indy's usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' isn't by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix' laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.This is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg's output: A young Indiana 'beginning' his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat 'You lost today kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it.' and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There's a bit of kissing/banter, and it's implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there's ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn't need another sequel after third release. There's nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy's Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it's up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.The chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",10,130,143,16 October 2015
Back to the Future," A classic masterpiece the original the only best my favorite time travel film of all time
","What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award '- winning team of Steven Spielberg' and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car 'DeLorean'. Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost 'chewed every scenes' in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs 'The Power of Love,' and 'Earth Angel'.The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as ' A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! '",10,177,191,17 April 2017
The Bourne Supremacy," The best sequel in my opinion, my number 1 favorite Bourne flick ever!
","This is the best sequel in The Bourne Trilogy in my honest opinion. I love the sequel much more than the original movie. The Bourne Supremacy is my number 1 favorite Jason Bourne film, while the second one is The Bourne Identity. It was always movie that I wanted to see the first time I heard about it. It is the second Bourne movie based on the second novel by Robert Ludlum. I love this movie to death it is a brilliant, absolutely brilliant spy action flick! I love this movie because it is fast paced, it is short mostly it is a logical movie that I quickly learn to get the plot about the movie. Trough entire movie Jason Bourne is framed on a run he is alone, tired, with a dead girlfriend and he hasn't seen diddly-squat from anybody down here. That an action hero suppose to be alone single shot down the bad guys that's what Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) did in this movie. I love the lead charterer in this movie, the action, the espionage, Matt shows feelings in this movie. Joan Allen was fantastic as Pamela Landy she was incredible awesome! I love the actress in this movie I love her to death!! Matt Damon once again does a powerful job performing his character and he is brilliant with excellent skills. He has a talent playing Jason Bourne. He's acting ability are very unique and incredible at the screen. Plot: When Jason Bourne is framed for a CIA operation gone awry, he is forced to resume his former life as a trained assassin to survive. Matt Damon returns as the covert operative known as Jason Bourne, who comes out of hiding to expose who is responsible for a series of assassinations that were done in his name. The plot is simple: Kirill (Karl Urban) a Russian Secret Service assassin who works for Russians, kills in Berlin two CIA agents and frames Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) by planting his fingerprints. In India he try's to kill Bourne but he misses and he kills Marie (Franka Potente) Bourne's Love, but misses him. Now Bourne does what he does best, avenge his girlfriend and clearing his name. First he thinks it is Treadstone all over again and that Deputy Director Pamela Landy is the leader of that program but when he find's out that Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and the Russians set him up and they are responsible for killing his girlfriend, he goes after them in Russia and he eludes the cops and the CIA operatives. He remembers flashbacks when he killed a young Couple Neski when he was an agent. What I love about this movie: Jason Bourne blows all wide open the Russians, he foils their plans, he foils Abbot's plans with the Russians. He kills in self defense the last member of the Treadstone program, he kills Kirill (Karl Urban) the murderer who killed Marie and he avenges his girlfriend. He confesses he's crimes to Irena Neski(Oksana Akinshina) what he did and he didn't except forgiveness. He is a bad-ass in this movie!I love the actor Karl Urban the actor always appears in a movies that I like: Dredd, Doom and Red. I love the actor I really love him he did a good job. I like the actress Oksana Akinshina as Irena Neski and I love the actress Julia Styles as Nicky Parsons she helps hunting Bourne again but, this time she helps Pamela Landy, I know she has a small role in here, but she is still decent.I love Brian Cox as Ward Abbott he was a good villain in this movie gosh I love this flick to death. Paul Greengrass did a good job directing the sequel that I love to death. This is the movie I have always loved since the first time I saw. I love it. Jason Bourne is the best action hero to come out of the movie/book world and he is a decent likable character. Supremacy is the second in the series, and it definitely meets/tops the first. Jason is still kick-butt awesome, even after two years undercover. Unfortunately, the CIA is on his case again, even after he sort of asked nicely for them to leave him alone (oh, who am I kidding? He beat up the guy and threatened the entire agency). Without giving too much away, let's just say that, in typical Bourne fashion, a can of kick-butt is opened on the bad guys. My favorite bits are the sequence where a consulate guy tries to get answers out of Bourne, the part at the Alexanderplatz with Nicky and Bourne that they faces each other in person for the first time, and the car chase ('cause it's not a Bourne movie without him wrecking as many cars as possible!).Watch this one a few times, and you'll likely be quite moved each time. I'll be surprised if you give it less than what I gave it: 10/10 outstanding score and an awesome movie that I love to death.The Bourne Supremacy is a 2004 American-German thriller film starring Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne character. Though it takes the name of the second Bourne novel, its plot is entirely different. The film was directed by Paul Greengrass from a screenplay by Tony Gilroy. Universal Pictures released the film to theaters in the United States on July 23, 2004. It is the second in the Jason Bourne film series.10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, Karl Urban, Gabriel Mann, Joan Allen, Michelle Monaghan, Karel Roden Director: Paul Greengrass Producers: Frank Marshall, Patrick Crowley Paul L.

Jurassic Park," A Spielberg Cult Classic Film and a great science fiction action adventure film of all time.
","Jurassic Park is a 1993 American science fiction adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is the first installment of the Jurassic Park film series. It is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton, with a screenplay written by Crichton and David Koepp. The film centers on the fictional Isla Nublar, an islet located off Central America's Pacific Coast, near Costa Rica, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of genetic scientists have created a wildlife park of cloned dinosaurs.Jurassic Park is the second Steven's Spielberg Classic cult Film. A great science fiction/action/adventure film. This film is great edge of your seat action sequences. It has a wonderful cast with wonderful performance of their characters. John Williams music score is excellent the same like is in Indiana Jones films. Beside Raiders of the Lost Ark is the second Best classic movie in the franchise. Jurassic Park (1993) was nominated for 3 Academy Awards for Best Sound, Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects.I love this film to death! It is been 22.years since we got this awesome adventure dinosaurs flick. I know a couple of friends of mine that love this film including me. It is a cult classic film and It has a heart. We have Tyrannosaurus Rex chasing the group, Velociraptors chasing Tim and Lex after they are reaching the visitor center and they are in inside the main kitchen. Dilophosaurus killing Nerdy. We also have Triceratops in it and Brachiosaurus. They are other dinosaurs used in the film: Gallimimus, Parasaurolophus and Alamosaurus they both had a cameo scene in it.The special effects creating the dinosaurs by Stan Winston are FANTASTIC! The dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light & Magic and with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston's team. To showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars, Spielberg invested in the creation of DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats. Stan Winston and his team did a great job animating live Dinosaurs on a screen. Steven Spielberg did a wonderful job directing this film, it is definitely my second best childhood film from Steven Spielberg. The first best film would be Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) which I love this film to death. The screen play written by Michael Crichton and David Koepp did a great job and the plot of the film was just awesome.The plot: During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.The crew cast all did a wonderful job of acting. The acting of this film was terrific and believable.Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, a leading paleontologist did a wonderful job portraying his character. He act the character like he was written on his skin. Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler, a paleobotanist. did a wonderful job like how she cared about an ill Triceratops. I was really surprised how the character cares about an ill dinosaurs that she barely know and she wanted to help him was out stating! Laura Dern for me in this film was a heart and a key watching this film of how a good hearted person she is. Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician and chaos theorist was really good in his acting and his character. Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, InGen's billionaire CEO and the park's creator was awesome playing his character. It is really a shame Richard Attenborough died last year and he isn't with us anymore. Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello as Lex and Tim did a wonderful job portraying John Hammonds grand children. I didn't know Samuel L. Jackson was in this film I really didn't know that. The whole cast was awesome in here.Music by score by John Williams is fabulous and fantastic I always love this song to death.There is everything in this film I love. How Dr. Grant, Lex and Tim are fighting to survive when they are trapped alone in the park. How tough and strong they are they don't panic and screaming they are fighting to come back save home. Lex and Tim are cornered by a pair of raptors inside the main kitchen. In one of the most terrifying scenes in the entire film, the raptors stalk through the dark kitchen, searching for the kids. Eventually, Lex and Tim manage to lure one of the raptors into the freezer and lock it in, but the other raptor chases them out of the kitchen. The scene was the most memorable to me and terrifying. Another terrifying scene is when Ellie discovers Ray's severed arm in the maintenance shed and she sees the raptor that eat Ray try's to eat her, that also scared me a lot. After the power was cut off on the electric fences and the kids with Alan are climbing over the fences and the power is turn back on by Ellie and Ray the fence electrifies Tim and he fly's down off the fence. The scene was awesome but also terrifying and real.I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie like this?! It is a perfect 10. I love this film to death! I love this film to death!! The action sequences are also awesome, the plot, the cast everything is great about this film.",10,156,169,10 October 2015
Evil Dead II," The best Evil Dead movie of all time my personal favorite
","Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987) is more than a sequel to a cult classic film from The Evil Dead (1981) this film is more of a prequel to the Army of Darkness (1992) that was made 5. years later. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is my number 1 favorite film best Evil Dead movie in the franchise. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. I love this film to death and I love it so damn much. I enjoy this film a lot, it is one of my favorite movie's in the trilogy. This is a great movie fun gory entertaining kick-ass sequel. It has action, comedy and horror mixed together that is why I love this film to death! Bruce Campbell is pure fun bad-ass Ash I absolutely love him in this sequel. I miss the 80's and that really best action gory movies un like they are today.This sequel to the original movie is the perfect balance between the horror of the original and the silliness of the third installment. It succeeds because it has fun with the 'B' movie genre, never claiming to be better than it is while employing witty direction and dialogue. The scene I remember most is when blood splashes on the lightbulb, making the room glow red. The first time I watch it, this film really confused me a lot because I thought it was sequel to The Evil Dead but it had a lot of changes, which I love that. I have enjoyed a lot of this film, it is one of my second favorite movie's of the trilogy. Bruce Campbell is pure fun and it's witty. Don't get me wrong I love both of Evil Dead films, but I just prefer Army of Darkness more, because it has funny scenes and it has a happy ending, those two films doesn't have happy endings, that is why I love Army of Darkness much better. The film it is just more of the same thing. Literally. But don't take that as such a negative thing. With the success of the low-budget original under his belt, director Sam Raimi re-imagined his first draft and added many elements he just did not have either the time or the money to accomplish on the first pass. On some level, the film certainly works as a nightmare that has to be replayed by our poor reluctant hero Ash. second Evil pairing of writer-director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell doesn't pick up from where the first Evil Dead left off, it instead reinvents some of the same characters from the first film, notably Campbell's daffy hero Ash and putative girlfriend Linda (played by Denise Bixler in this film), and plops them back in the same basic plot setup as the first film, in a kind of horror-comedy Groundhog Day scenario.Once again Ash visits an isolated cabin in the woods, turns on a tape recorder that has a professor spouting verbiage from the Necronomicon, and the next thing you know, all hell has broken loose, quite literally. Raimi is a director who may not win points for finesse, but he works in a manic, breathless style that is perfectly suited for the outré black comedy of the Evil Dead franchise, and that devil may care, throw caution to the wind spirit is what has made the Evil Dead trilogy (Army of Darkness was the third film, though there's evidently a Raimi-Campbell remake of the original Evil Dead in the offing) such a cult sensation and what continues to draw audiences to the films to this day. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is an extremely gruesome affair, but it's also laugh out loud hilarious a lot of the time, with Campbell's intentionally arch delivery and wide-eyed crazed, cartoonish performance style making the most of Raimi and co-scenarist Scott Speigel's reinvention of the Evil Dead premise. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is really a sly, if sometimes sinister, comedy, one blacker than, well, death, but which delivers some consistent guffaws mixed in with the more typical 'avert your eyes' blood and guts.Ash (Bruce Campbell), the sole survivor of THE EVIL DEAD, returns to the same cabin in the woods and again unleashes the forces of the dead. With his girlfriend possessed by the demons and his body parts running amok, Ash is forced to single- handedly battle the legions of the damned as the most lethal - and groovy - hero in horror movie history! Welcome to EVIL DEAD II, director Sam Raimi's infamous sequel to THE EVIL DEAD and outrageous prequel to ARMY OF DARKNESS!Evil Dead II (referred to in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is a 1987 American horror comedy film directed by Sam Raimi and a parody sequel to the 1981 film The Evil Dead. The film was written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel (they wrote the screenplay during the production of another collaboration Crimewave), produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams.I love this film and Army of Darkness!!!!",10,92,107,24 October 2015
Furious 7," One last ride - not a bad action flick i like it
","A really good movie and not a bad action movie I really like it, the whole gang is here. Fast Five (2011) is still to me the best one and my favorite in the franchise and then it would be Furious 6 than The Fast and the Furious I think this would be my fourth favorite film in the franchise. It is an entertaining fun fast paced action film and that really a good one. But it is not perfect I have issues with the film which I will get to it but first I want to write goods about this film.I can't wait till I watch The Fate of the Furious I am getting on Blu-ray next week so yesterday I re-watch this film and I have enjoy it. Furious 7 is the seventh installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the sixth highest-grossing opening of all time. The film has grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide – more than the franchise's first five installments combined – making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise after just twelve days, the third highest-grossing film of 2015 and the sixth highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, The Fate of the Furious, was released on April 14, 2017.The film's about Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), until Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother, puts the team in danger once again. The cast includes: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham. I like this flick they action is crazier than ever, there's some unnecessary camera moves and this one needs an even bigger suspension of disbelief, it barely pauses in between set pieces. Kurt Russell is in this and like I have said in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 my review I hated his performance in that movie but in here I loved him he was awesome and a really good guy and likable. He has more to do in this film than he did in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto is always terrific and a bad-ass I absolutely love him. Jason Statham is a crazy motherf***** in this I have enjoyed him I always wanted Statham as a bad guy. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz Dom's girlfriend was hot as always I have simply enjoyed her. The rest of the cast was alright.The issues with the film I have is: Why is shaky cam in the beginning of the fights between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham and on the end of the fights between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham that really hurts this film. I got a migraine because of the shaking cam.Dwayne Johnson was only in the beginning of the film and for the rest of the film he was departure he appeared only on the end of the film in the final showdown I only wish he would be more in this film and he would have more to do but I still have enjoyed his performance awesome. Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto is useless in this movie she doesn't do nothing her character is just wasted and useless. I don't know why they put her character in this movie. Lucky Michelle Rodriguez fulfill the emptiness in Dom's crew. Car's with flying parachutes also doesn't fit in the film because of the metal weight parachutes can't hold that kind of metal and some unnecessary CGI was used in this film that also hurt the movie. Those are all the issues I have, I can't wait for The Fate of the Furious to see it I heard it is a good film.The rating this film get's is a A 9/10 I would have give it 10 but those issues in my opinion hurt the film. Paul Walker died in November 30 2013 so his two brothers Caleb and Cody Walker replaced him and they help to make this film right so I have enjoy from all three brothers performance. R.I.P. Paul Walker my favorite actor and my all time favorite character of the franchise Brian O'Conner. This film is dedicated to his memory which I love. Furious 7 (alternatively known as Fast & Furious 7 and Fast 7) is a 2015 American action film directed by James Wan and written by Chris Morgan.

The Godfather," Francis Ford Coppola's Epic Classic Masterpice
","The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original 'Movie Brats' who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): 'I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.' I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!! The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures) The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter. Gosh this movie is awesome and fantastic! I love it to death!!!!!10/10 Grade: Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Paramount Pictures Starring: Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall,Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte,Diane Keaton Director: Francis Ford Coppola Producer: Albert S.
