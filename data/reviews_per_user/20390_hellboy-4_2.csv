Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I loved it.
","I am going to go out on a limb and say that the Phantom Menace is the best Star Wars movie yet. I am tired of seeing reviews where people hate jar jar binks (yeah he is annoying, get over it) and say the movie is flat and has no real emotion.  In response to these 'critics' i point out the scene of anakin and his mother right before the leaves tatooine, very touching. The response of obi wan when...well you know the scene i'm speaking of; quite emotional.  Yes the movie has many special effects but this alone does not make the movie.  The rich characters and emotions shown by those characters is what makes star wars: the phantom menace every bit as good as the original trilogy. I am only 19 and did not see the first three installments in the theaters and maybe this is what makes the phantom menace to me more special than the originals.  The old school fans can whine and complain about how phantom menace doesn't measure up to the first three but they know that this one is just as spectacular as the first time they saw star wars.",Null,0,0,22 May 1999
The Matrix," One word......dissapointed
","I missed this in the theater and man Im glad I did.  I can't believe the lack of originality in this movie.  The special effects werent enough to hold my interest.  Dark City and Blade both surpass this movie in every way, the prior for story and the latter for action.  Every thing about this movie was cliche and the ending...can anyone say sleeping beauty!!  It was a good movie but not ground breaking, the sci-fi world has seen better and so have I.",Null,0,0,23 September 1999
