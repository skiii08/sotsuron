Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Very original homage
","What a film! The story twists and turns and strikes quicker than a cobra. You won't find references to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings here - you'll have to watch The Magic Roundabout for that. But it is a wonderful homage to David Carrafine's kung fu. It seems the film was written for him but there are brilliant performances from all the leads. 'I must warn you young lady that I am susceptible to flattery' is delivered with dripping lasciviousness. The characters are alternative in my book - witness the assassin who meekly obeys a tart and the child who goes to sleep watching murder movies. They all create tensions, right, left and centre that are suddenly released in an almost unclimactic way. Twice as good as KB1 but couldn't have been, without it.",10,0,1,28 February 2005
