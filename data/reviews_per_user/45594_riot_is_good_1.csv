Marie Antoinette," A little bit too long..
","When I saw the trailer, I thought this movie could be something. OK there wasn't anything interesting that was shown, but hey! It was directed and written by Sophia Coppolla! So when the movie came out, I dragged my boyfriend to see this movie. After 20 minutes I was already bored. There are too much details! You see a bird fly for 2 minutes, then it's a sheep eating for 5, then it's Marie-Antoinette going up the stairs for 3 minutes! People say this movie is eye candy, and they're right. The costumes are amazing and the places are just as wonderful. But seriously, the movie could have lasted 15 minutes and you would have not been lost at all! When the movie starts to be interesting, it's the end! I was really disappointed.",5,2,6,11 November 2006
