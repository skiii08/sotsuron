Men in Black 3," Probably one of my favorite dumbest blockbusters I have seen in my life.
","The plot of this movie makes absolutely no sense apart from the character's arcs. All the time travel stuff is used in the movie like one would use toilet paper, but it is at leat entertaining.
Great acting with top performances from Josh Brolin / Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. A lot of beautiful visuals and a lot of flashy colors make the film appealing. A lot of CGI that are sometimes good and sometimes awful. This movie has some flaws, but what makes it stand apart from other blockbusters is that you feel the passion with which it was made and crafted. There is a heart and a soul to the whole film and that's why it is my favorite MIB movie, although I couldn't defend this title in an objective debate.",6,0,1,14 February 2020
The Equalizer," Good entertainment but tooooo long
","2 hours is really a stretch for a movie with such a simple plot. It's a good story, but the first part drags way too long. Good action and terrific acting from both Denzel Washington and Chloe Grace Moretz. Good directing from Antoine Fuqua as well. It is a good action movie, but this one isn't really mesmerizing. In a few years, I will remember John Wick movies way better. That's what happens when you have a good film but almost no originality whatsoever. I enjoyed it, but I also feel a great potential that could have been better exploited.",8,0,1,10 October 2019
Mulan," Better as most Disneys
","An interesting female character with some depth. You don't see that everyday and even less in a Disney.
The animation has not aged well, but that's inevitable in 2020 where the technique has known so much imporvement in the past years.
The film's beginning is the weakest part in my opinion. I couldn't feel invested in Mulan's fate because she acted in such a dumb way that it seemed inevitable she would be in unpleasant situations. But from the point where she begins er training, has a goal and is focused, I was in. The ending is magnificent in every way.
However, I am not a fan of this disney-ish chinese culture. That's personal but Disney bringing its touch to every culture, more particularly one that is so different, is out of place in my opinion.
The music is incredible and the directing is good. A film that could have been better, but is quite enjoyable.",7,0,0,15 February 2020
World War Z," Such a pity, could have been great
","It's a good movie, but there was so much potential to exploit!
The action is amazing, I can't deny it. The scene of Jerusalem's wall is incredible. Visually it's great and the CGI is pretty good.
However the rest of the film is completely uneven. Dialogs can be either very interesting and thoughtful or completely dumb when Brad Pitt is with his family.
Brad's not in it for this movie. He acts more like a slug than a soldier in my opinion. One of his worst performances (does not make it awful, we are talking about Brad Pitt).
There is also no character arc or development in the movie. Brad is just a retired dude working his ass off to save his family but you don't learn anything deeper about it, except something about his previous job. Characterization almost as weak as the zombies...
The plot is what it is: a mixed bag of both good and bad ideas with a strong intro and ending but quite a mess in the middle since you follow a character with no particularity whatsoever.
Entertaining, yes! Enjoyable, yes! A wasted potential, yes again. This movie however shows some unique scenes in a movie of the genre and I personally do not regret watching it.",7,0,1,17 October 2019
Terminator Salvation," Nice try
",The movie isn't perfect. There are many flaws related to the plot or secondary characters development but the visuals and action are breathtaking. Very good CG and acting. This movie is far better than its reputation. Stands as a worthy sequel to me if you can accept what happened in rise of the machines. I had a very good time watching it. By far the best terminator film since judgement day.,7,1,1,4 October 2019
The Polar Express," What an adventure!
","This is a huge emotional rollercoaster. My review is highly subjecitve and I loved this movie. It has its flaws. All the characters are not very attaching and there are a bunch of plot holes.
Animation is quite amazing. When it comes to landscapes and decors, I was amazed. However when it comes ti the details of the characters' faces, you can see the limits to the animation technologies of 2004. No reason to hold a grudge however.
If you want to feel like a child waiting for Christmas, watch this movie. It is an adventure's fiction of Christmas as we would have wished it when we were children. You just have to open your mind and immerse yourself in the story. Great job!",8,0,1,1 December 2019
Underworld Awakening," It hurts... it's not even entertaining at times.
","I am a big fan of the previous underworld, especially the third, but this one, I could not enjoy it.
The film begins by taking a risk and introduce you to a new context where the humans learned about the two species of vampires and lycans. Problem: you do not get the explanation of how a secret that was kept for centuries is no more one. Worse, at the end of the movie, this wind of change is no more than the same ennemy: the lycans... That's what I call to shoot a bullet in its own foot...
I will however briefly state what I enjoyed in the movie and what worked in every movie so far: the decors that are beautifully staged and with a lot of inspiration to give the so specific ambiance of this whole franchise and colors and visuals. They are wonderfully done. Congratulations.
Now, the acting triggers mixed feelings for me in this movie because there are both good and bad performances, but that's not why I will remember the movie as bad.
The writing of the characters is so basic and insipid. It's truly a shame for a serie such as Underworld films that never have been masterpieces of writing, but managed to make the audience connect emotionally with singular character at least. There are also many plot holes that could easily have been avoided, had the film been 20 minutes longer.
The dialogs are basic and dumb as can be and a few scenes are made even worse by an horrible editing that cuts the scene right to the moment where an interaction between two characters should go on. That's very frustrating, but at least I can say that this movie doesn't lack pace, even if it's for all the wrong reasons.
Otherwise, a few jumpcuts and incoherences, but that's just detail at this point... They should have stopped at the third movie. It's a thing to want to continue a story with potential, it's another thing to execute it correctly. More is rarely a synonym of better with the franchises these last years.",5,0,0,2 March 2020
Watchmen," A bomb dropped on my head
","That is a particular movie. It may struggle with its rhythm and narrative structure, but the message is so engaged and interesting. The characters are so well written. Acting and dialogs are phenomenal and fight scenes are competently choreographed. Visually it is unique. You can say what you want about Snyder, but saying that he has no specific style and doesn't deserve to be considered as an author could not be further from the truth. Some aspects of the movie could be improved but it feels so unique that I actually prefer to congratulate Snyder for his work. That's a hell of a movie!",9,2,3,25 October 2019
Wanted," Hahahahahaha
","This could be a good movie, but ends up being so ridiculous.
This might be the first time I witness James McAvoy acting badly. It deserves an oscar. Hopefully, Morgan Freeman is here to level a bit the film up.
Good ideas, good CGI, but the end product is awful.
I must say that at least I laughed a lot, but whoah am I amazed to see that such a good material can be wasted!",5,2,6,26 October 2019
A Clockwork Orange," Powerful and without any kind of concesion
","This film is horrible not because of graphic violence, but because of the way the characters behave and talk to each other. There are a lot of different ways to analyse this movie and everyone will have a different interpretation, but it certainly won't let you indifferent.",9,1,2,18 November 2019
National Treasure," Very entertaining for a family movie
","This is a more than decent directed, staged and acted movie. However, there are many plot holes, which are quite usual for this type of family movies. There are also a lot of reference to the history of the United States, but if you are not familiar with the details, it's just not worth it. The dialogs don't help and are not very well written. I would describe the film as a forgettable, but generous entertainment.",7,0,0,13 April 2020
Total Recall," Generous but flawed
","I love this film's story and the ideas to stage those, but some plot points are not enough exploited and some action sequence are just not coherent regarding the distances of the fighters. Chor√©graphies are not very inspired.
However, visually it is very inspired. The concepts and ideas explored are very interesting and this is exactly with this way of approaching science fiction that I like this genre. It's a mixed bag but you can feel the passion with which the whole movie is crafted. I wish I could like it more.",7,3,6,31 October 2019
Zombieland," Quite enjoyable, but not great
","What I enjoy about this movie is that it does not try to be more than what it is: a family road-trip with zombies along the way.
The acting is incredible, be it with Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone or Jesse Eisenberg. Special mention to Woody Harrelson because the dude just kills it! The guy is the coolest guy I have seen on screen in a while.
The CGI is ok, visuals and directing are competently made.
The plot has a lot of faicilities and I am not a fan of some choices. For example, the fact that every rule is written on the screen. For something that is repeated so many times during the movie, I find that Fleischer kind of takes the spectator for a dumbass. I am also not a fan of Jesse Eisenberg as narrator and I believe the film would have been a bit better without a guy explaining everything about it instead of just showing us who he is on screen. Kind of lazy I find.
Anyway...enough nitpicking, I enjoyed the ride and look forward to seeing the second one.",8,1,2,16 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Not perfect, but very entertaining and clever
","The script is well handled at any moment, though the ending lets the door open to many sequels possibilities. I would prefer it as a stand-alone movie. Good acting from Tom Cruise and very good performance from emily blunt. Fights and actions are very impressive, although the CGI isn't perfect. There is always an evolution in the script and the pacing is just incredible. Worth watching in my opinion for anyone liking sci-fi.",8,0,0,4 October 2019
Arrival," Interesting but not a classic
","The idea of language and communication between people studied and shown using sci-fi codes is daring. However, despite excellent acting, good visuals and CGI, very good directing and a good plot, I can't say I found this incredible and mesmerizing. I will remember this film as an interesting proposition in an over saturated genre. The science fiction codes are used to show a more intimate story and despite all the qualities, I can't put it on the same level than other iconic movies.",8,0,0,22 October 2019
The Conjuring," Far more consistent as I expected
","When I usually see a horror movie, I expect a pretty straightforward story with a basic plot. Here, both exceeded my expectations.
The existence from spirits is admitted right away, but where most films try to mistify it, this one will try to bring scientific explanations. At the end, you do not get the asnwers to all the questions you have on a broader scale, but all the ones regarding the film's story. This is a very focused film that takes place in a limited space to make it feel more personal and catching. The processes used to scare are known and absolutely not revolutionnary, but they are well used and with efficiency.
The is a very nice photography and directing. James Wan likes to play with his camera and has a gift for framing very nice pictures. The actors are good with a top notch perfromances form Patrick Wilson and Vera Farminga.
This is not an amazing horror movie, but a well told story that manages to bring tension when required. An excellent base for a shared universe as well...",8,0,1,15 February 2020
