Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awesome, from beginning to end.
","Well, I was lucky to be able to see this before school, 5am.  For those of you who haven't seen it I won't give any spoilers believe me you won't want them.  I always liked the other three Star Wars but only because of Han Solo....  But after this one I  know it's good all the way through. Special effects were great.  Jarr Jarr Binks has the funniest voice.  Jaba the Hut was better considering this time he was computer animated instead of a puppet.  It was all around good and I definitely recommend it.",9,0,0,19 May 1999
A Clockwork Orange," Very Good Movie.
",This movie was Awesome.  I could have done without some of the nudity but it was needed to get the whole effect.  This movie is not for the weak minded. The ones who watch something and suddenly they have to go out and do it or think its cool.  Because what happens is not cool but it makes for a good story line.  Certainly one you have to see.,8,0,0,5 June 1999
