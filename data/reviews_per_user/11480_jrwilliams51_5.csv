Alien 3," FIRE
","I dont want to say a whole lot about this movie release that hasnt already been acompanied by great reading from the Web, and by film release captioning.There are a lot of great actors, and Stars encluding SIGOURNEY WEAVER. And I especially enjoy its graphics, dialog, and background.Sigourney makes a great entry,and with all its adversity that came from dieing at the end. I think the alien sequel brought it all into a focus of a never ending saga from alien rivalry to breeding eggs, and alien stories that max the screens of Hollywood.But whats so engraving with the Alien series is they will never have to worry about competition. SO I certainly dont mind giving ALIEN 3, an absolute perfect ten from its original soundtract to its new sound release.",10,1,5,21 April 2000
Alien: Resurrection," THE MOVIE IN GENERAL,AND THE ACTRESS!
","I like being able to comment on this movie in the reigns of it's particularity, grade, and authenticity of what was once thought to be ill-reverently disposed of more incomprenceively dead then to be alive explodes with ever more enlightening expenditures of sequel and praise. Sigourney Weaver who stars as Lieutenant Ripley has been brought back to life after her ill fate with the alien dread aboard it's ship the Sulaco. Bringing on now ever more exposure, and harness to what in this movie a creature that cannot be contained by the military operations of technology, and base. However Sigourney Weaver surpasses her role in this rate, and film of movie career in tee's of throwing the towel in revealing, in finding her most inner self in scenes of playing roles that stagger imagination of passion, in wailing days of exotic role, and majesty. I thank GOD for this opportunity in giving to the rating of its excellency.Jerry Williams",10,9,15,3 March 2000
Alien," PRINCESS
","I think the ending says it all for the Most, bringing into focus like a fairy tale that comes true the Princes of the Nile floating out there in space for generations to come, and for all that are near in the trigonometry of space. I've read also about the movie the Alien, and it's like as if never enough could be said with all it's documentary, and with all that can be introduced to it ever throwing generation of commentary. I think it's a great movie and of course a prelude to all the other alot like eating good ice-cream. A real dream boat of flavor. I mean, who ever would have thought of a knock-out bod, and bode of a body that could take out a grurome, all-teeth-showing alien.",10,0,1,21 March 2000
Aliens," SURVIVORS
","Well it's a great movie by far for anyone to enjoy as well as kids. In a far out space battle of ultimate science fi-fun, fiction, and thriller. There are a lot of great stars, and actors in this film release not to mention Sigourney Weaver as Lieutenaunt Ripley, and a lot of great lines, and graphics that perform to it's performing arts and it's originality. Of course it's favor is not as incredibly bizarre as in the first series Alien. But it does take it's toll, and exact in the third series Alien 3 with it's stretch out scene of pandomonia. Sigourney Weaver is a great star in this movie as well as in all her movies, extremely talented,and a very good leading Actress. As Lieutenant Ripley she stands out in her role once again taking charge over the alien menace, bringing an end to its over invading presence, and destroying preeminence. Full of love, and compassion that is heart felt, and loved by one little girls hope for survival upon the surveying planet of little hope. Sigourney Weaver brings the entire population of aliens, and it's queen egg layer to a desolate round of no count, and non existence. With enlist survivors Leuitenaunt Ripley one soldier, and one Android, and one little girl. This horror science-fi ends as a true love story for one little girl and what's left of a surviving crew.",10,1,2,4 April 2000
