The Incredible Hulk," An underrated comic book movie
","I personally enjoyed this version about the big, green guy and have never understood a lot of the bad critical reviews or the negative reactions to it. True that Mark Ruffalo has proved to be a more believable Bruce Banner than Edward Norton, however the story itself was solid and fun to watch. Really, I'm starting to think that some viewers expect waaay too much from every comic book movie. Not every one is going to be TDK, Avengers or Iron Man. Some of these movies stand above their counterparts but that doesn't make the second place entries bad, just not on the same par. Decent acting and good action sequences make this a movie to watch again.",7,0,1,28 October 2016
Star Trek," Action packed movie with absurd, cartoonish characters
","Let me get this out of the way first - J.J. Abrams is not a good director. Period. I don't care that younger viewers enjoy watching his movies; he produces flashy bilge an nothing this guy has done since CLOVERFIELD is original, nor good. Now let's get to J.J. Abrams's 'reimagined' STAR TREK, which is full of unfunny homages (there's a hot, green lady on the bed) to characters who act completely out of character (see Spock with emotion impulse control issues, Uhura the pompous slut and Kirk the hotdogger who bumbles his way from one crisis to another and escapes by sheer luck). The plot. Okay, 'Nero' seems like a rather Earthy name but let's just run with it. Using the plot from the Next Generations movie NEMESIS, Nero has a supersized ship that all but wiped out an entire Federation fleet so he can get to Vulcan and destroy it using a big drill on a cord from his ship (why not just nuke the planet from space?) and then dropping a small black hole into the center of the planet. Check that off, Spock's home world destroyed and now ON TO EARTH, because we always have to include Earth in every damn Trek movie these days.Nero's beef with Vulcan, Earth and the Federation? His world was destroyed when Spock from the original time line we knew in the original films (see great Trek movies like ST 2, 3 and 4) went back in time (more borrowing from earlier Trek movies) to save Nero's race (Romulus, which was also the planet of the bad guy from NEMESIS) from being annihilated by a Super Nova. Spock gets there too late to save Romulus and Nero's wife and children die in the planet ending explosion. Now since Spock had a time machine on a ship, couldn't he have just gone back again and gotten to Romulus earlier, before the explosion? The way the old Spock explains it to the newer, idiot Kirk never really makes sense. Anyhow, Nero gets a hold of time travel, goes back to wipe out EVERYONE since he can't have his family and race. Along they way there are the intros to Scotty, Bones and other characters but you're still scratching your head trying to figure out WTF they are doing in this film. It feels like they threw a bunch of stuff together for a last-minute homework assignment, put some flashy space battles in along with groan inducing one-liners and said 'RUN WITH IT, THE PROLES WILL LAP IT UP!'And people DID lap it up, calling it 'very cool' and 'fun' and 'action packed' but nobody except longtime Trek fans and most semi-coherent adults saw what it was, overblown cinematic garbage.The pinnacle of the absurdity of this movie is when Spock, as acting commander of the Enterprise, jettisons Kirk in a giant bubble down onto an ice world (hope he doesn't freeze, oh and that there is air to breathe down there) because he was a treat aboard the ship. Why not just lock him in a holding cell? I think they had those on the old Enterprise from the 1960's series. Ever heard of them? This moment gets more absurd because Kirk just happens to land on the one planet in the entire Universe (not Galaxy but Universe - see mathematical impossibility) where old Spock happens to be stranded. Illogical, Confusing, Stupid. This is not a new, exciting remake (unless you want all action, useless characters and no plot), this is shake in some old Trek movie ideas, get new actors/actresses with terrible lines and throw in a lot of lasers and explosions. The only reason it gets a 3 is because of the action. That's all about this movie can offer for the $9 you paid for it.",3,2,4,24 November 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Diary of a teenage superhero
","I wanted to write this while my thoughts were fresh from having watched 'Spider-man: Homecoming' at a late showing on Tuesday.It was a fun experience and I like how SONY-MARVEL wove Spider-man into the greater MCU and still retained his own story. It started with his appearance in 'Captain America: Civil War' and continued from the end of that movie. We get to see the boy behind the mask and how the thrill of having teamed with the Avengers affects his feelings about his powers and his place in the world, all this while he's still trying to be a teenager with a teenager's attitude and issues. More than anything, I'd say it's a movie about growing-up and growing-into a superhero. Tony Stark adds a nice touch as Peter Parker/Spider-man's sometimes mentor as we watch the web-slinger make some rookie mistakes in his zeal to impress Tony. There's some great interplay between the two and with Tony's assistant, Happy Hogan. We also get introduced to Peter Parker's day-to-day life in high school and his interaction with best friend Ned and fellow classmates Liz, Michelle and Flash Thompson. I really like how they fleshed out these minor but important characters in Peter's formative world. Then there is Adrian Toomes - the Vulture - who is given depth as the villain. Michael Keaton does a fantastic job making Toomes a sympathetic, albeit dangerous baddie. The movie is well paced, entertaining and family friendly. You get to watch Peter mature as a person and see Spider-man mature as a hero. I look forward to more collaborative efforts between SONY and MARVEL. They got a home run at best and a triple play at the least. Go see it!",8,1,5,19 July 2017
Suicide Squad," This movie had great moments
","I neither loved nor hated Suicide Squad. It was fun movie to watch, although the villain left something to be desired. Enchantress is okay as a minor baddie but not as the main baddie. Not enough time was spent telling her story in relation to her brother. Why he was he more powerful than her, yet had to be freed and controlled by her? Her plan was also a bit unconvincing, like she made it up as she went along. I believe if they had made her a puppet of a distant being, like Darkseid, it would have been more believable. He could have controlled her and her brother, tried to use them to destabilize Earth so he could take over easier. Oh well, what could have been! As for the Suicide Squad themselves, El Diablo, Deadshot and Harley Quinn where given good backstories. Katana had a bit of history but almost nothing was shown about Killer Croc or Captain Boomerang. 10-15 more minutes wouldn't have hurt the movie in order to know more about them. For me, Jared Leto's Joker was one of the more refreshing characters, mainly because they 'mobbed him up' a bit. Some fans hated this treatment but I thought was great! He was scary with his manic stares and highly unpredictable actions. Even his minions seemed on edge around him, possibly wondering if they were next on his list. I enjoyed watching his portrayal. So here's where I come down on SS. The movie was worth the price of admission as good entertainment. It certainly is far above Superman V Batman and makes me believe DC is on course to making better comic book films. The plot was a bit unclear and the villain was weak. Figuring in both factors, it's a 50-50 split, so 5 out of 10.",5,0,3,2 November 2016
Doctor Strange," Another fun, entertaining story from Marvel Studios
","I saw DS at the 7:15pm showing on Thursday. This movie is another fun one from Marvel and Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent in the role of Sorcerer Supreme! The origin part is pretty straight forward, from his car accident to him seeking ways to heal himself and meeting the Ancient One, head of a society protecting Earth from other-dimensional threats. Mads Mikkelsen is a good introductory villain and plays his role convincingly for the time he's on the screen. His argument to Strange is not without merit, so his motivation makes sense in his battle against the Ancient One, also played well by Tilda Swinton. Benedict Wong added a humorous role as the society librarian and head of the Hong Kong order. Pacing is one of Marvel's strengths and they move the movie along, not dwelling too long on one point. Some viewers might argue this is a weakness of Marvel films but I disagree. They don't get bogged down in minor questions and leave some of the bigger questions open to address in sequels. This is a family friendly movie and can be viewed by kids as well as adults. It's like watching a comic book on the big screen, something else that Marvel does really well! I give it an 8 out of 10.",8,3,6,4 November 2016
Interstellar," I finally saw this movie. It's lengthy but worth the time.
","Take your time watching this and pay attention to some of the minor details, they turn out to be major to the plot later on.A future Earth has exhausted the quality of planet's soil because humanity became too numerous (more than 6 billion) and a former pilot, would-be astronaut named Cooper is directed to an old NORAD site where NASA has been sending probes and manned ships into a wormhole that opened next to the planet Saturn. He finds the facility with the help of his daughter, who has been making notes about gravitational anomalies in their home (books falling off a shelf in specific numbered places) and figures out they are given coordinates. These coordinates lead them to the NORAD site. Fast forward, he joins the next NASA mission which send himself and three other scientist through the wormhole to investigate a new solar system with many worlds that humankind might be able to inhabit, since Earth is dying. With their fuel, they can only explore three but these are three worlds where previous, one-way missions ventured to see if they were habitable. They come up short on the first world which has huge gravitational fluctuations because it's close to a giant black hole. They are then lured to the second world by an unscrupulous scientist who was part of one of the earlier manned mission to explore the new planets. He wants to leave and tries to hijack the main ship in orbit around his captive world, only to kill himself and damage the main ship. Using one of Einstein's theories concerning black holes, he is able to slingshot the damage ship towards the last world they can explore, sending one remaining scientist and a robot assistant on board to reach the third planet. Coop releases himself in another spacecraft from the main ship and flies into the event horizon of the black hole. There he finds himself in a strange room that seems made of lines but is really a fifth dimension where he can look through and see his young daughter on the other side of the bookshelf where books where falling. He recognizes that she is the same age and it's the same time as when she first told him about the books. He also realizes that it was HIM sending her messages all along. Beyond this point, I won't give anything else away and my hands are getting tired too. LOL! It's a very complex movie but rewarding for those who want to invest the time (runtime is 169 minutes) to watch. It delivers on a lot of logical, theoretical and emotional levels. It makes you ask the question, can those of the future help those of the past. There is a lot of paradox in this story, so be prepared for that and free up your mind, otherwise it will cook your noggin!A solid 8 out of 10. It definitely pays homage to 2001, A SPACE ODESSY, at least in my opinion.",9,1,2,3 November 2016
Ant-Man," A minor character with a major movie success
","I had a great time watching ANT-MAN! Going in, I knew a little about the character from comic books, yet was skeptical they could make a truly good movie around him. Marvel Studios confirmed my faith once again! They presented ANT-MAN seamlessly into the greater Marvel Universe and gave viewers fun, memorable characters. The plot is simple but well played out. Paul Rudd is GREAT in this role and Michael Pena provides wonderfully funny moments as the sidekick. Michael Douglas does a good Hank Pym and Corey Stoll has just the right amount of villainy as Yellow Jacket. Evangeline Lilly is OK in her role as Hope Van Dyne. She does a lot of open-mouthed gaping, so don't paint me as someone impressed with her acting ability. It could have been how her character was written but I think it's telling that she's not reprising the role in the anticipated sequel. The best moments in the movie are from Ant-Man's training and from the final battle with Yellow Jacket on a kids train set. Those scenes are great entertainment! This is a good one for adults and kids alike.",8,1,2,17 November 2016
Cold Mountain," A very good time period movie
","Most Civil War movies have a tendency to overly dramatize the war scenes and ignore the day-to-day struggle of the common people caught in the middle. Not so with Cold Mountain, a movie that explores the individual lives of a preacher's daughter, her farm hand and her lover as their world spins out of control.Renee Zellweger delivers a tremendous performance, while Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are strong in their roles as well. This is a movie about memory and destiny. The conclusion will leave you with conflicting emotions but there's satisfaction from a story well told.I hope that producers learn from COLD MOUNTAIN and start making more era dramas that give you a connection with the characters and their times, as opposed to overly glorifying battlefield scenes. The lone battle scene in COLD MOUNTAIN was the battle of 'The Crater' during the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia. It is done with attention to the facts and illustrates the battle in all it's goriness. You felt like you were right there in the thick of the smoke, dirt and blood.The rest of the movie explores how the people of the 1860's coped with the savagery of their existence, how some remained in tune with their humanity and others devolved to murderous animals. Just an excellent movie all the way around. I've seen it twice and will watch it again!",10,2,3,29 November 2016
Spider-Man," My favorite comic book character brought to life
","2002's SPIDER-MAN is a marvelous telling of my favorite comic book character. When I first heard that Spidey was getting his own movie back in the early 2000's, I was skeptical that the feat could be pulled off. Thanks to the wonders of CGI, strong character casting and good directing from Sam Rami (a guy familiar with the source material), SPIDER-MAN was everything I dreamed it could be! Tobey MaGuire and William Dafoe feel perfect in their roles of Spider-man and his arch-enemy, Green Goblin. JK Simmons as J.J. Jameson is one of the more entertaining characters from comic book movies this past decade. He captures the cigar-chomping, sarcastic Daily Bugle editor in grand fashion! Other supporting casts are good as well, with James Franco as Harry Osborne, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and Cliff Roberson as Uncle Ben. You feel like you're swinging between buildings and dodging pumpkin bombs lobbed at you from Goblin's glider in the action sequences. The story line is easy to follow, has heart and is just plain fun! This one is in my DVD collection. It's not perfect but certainly close; a definite 9 out of 10 stars!",9,2,4,10 November 2016
Dark City," A thought provoking Sci-Fi
","I first saw this movie in 1999, right after my brother had viewed it and kept talking about it. Since then, I've seen it again many times and have it in my collection. It is a well told story with fine performances by Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly and William Hurt. There is a lot of depth and emotion to each character, you empathize with them and care about them. It is beautifully rendered, the scenes are eye-catching and the pacing is great. The plot is more original than most movies of this type. Overall, this is one of the best Sci-Fi films that not a lot of people have seen. Take some time this weekend and watch it. You won't be disappointed.",10,3,6,29 October 2016
The Mist," One of the better Stephen King story adaptations
","THE MIST is based on the short story of the same name from Stephen King's book 'Skeleton Crew' in the 1980's. This television movie adaptation certainly captures the fear, sense of conferment and hopelessness that's evident in the story. Townspeople trapped in a grocery store witness a swirling white mist descend on the town. Within this mist are terrifying giant insects, spiders and other grotesque creatures not of this Earth. The trapped people in the store start speculations as to what is happening. Everything from a military project gone wrong to an Armageddon-type religious ending are considered. Lines are drawn between groups in the store and distrust mounts. Eventually the main characters flee in a van and try to outrun the mist. The ending is one of the most shocking and unexpected you will ever see. I won't give it away but it's not at all what you imagine will happen.",8,0,2,18 November 2016
The Dark Knight," Simply the best!
","This is the BEST comic book movie I've ever seen, hands down! Chris Nolan assembled a stellar cast for his second Batman installment and it shows in the convincing portrayals of the characters. Everyone from Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal... all embrace their roles and the late Heath Ledger delivers a performance for the ages! The pacing is excellent, with Nolan turning up the intensity as the movie progresses. The tension between Bale's Batman and Ledger's Joker is exploited beautifully, as the former copes with his personal ethics and the latter constantly tests him. Aaron Eckhart's Two Face is a tragic figure who emerges as a consequence of this battle of wits and wills between the two main antagonists. This movie tends to be dark and asks the viewer to accept moral dilemmas; is it right to do what is considered wrong for the better good? A mesmerizing film of this genre and a must see for any fans or even non-fans. A masterpiece!",10,2,3,17 November 2016
30 Days of Night," The vampires were cool but everything else was silly
","30 DAYS OF NIGHT had gruesome and violent vampires only interested in feeding to their fill on the townspeople of Barrow, Alaska.That's the best part of the movie. The rest is, shall we say, very silly! First off, Barrow, Alaska looks like some old Western town with storefronts like Saloons or General Stores, only missing hitching posts outside. If you've ever seen actual photos of Barrow, you would notice that most every dwelling is a dome shaped abode or mobile home. Very few houses look like the ones in the movie. Nearly everyone in the Barrow of the movie is Caucasian, another inconsistency with a town that is not only real but primarily populated by Inuit peoples (Eskimos for the layman). The main hero and heroine are both typical, overly attractive people that look totally out of place in an area as rough as Barrow. They look like they just walked out of Macy's in Denver. Both are mostly uninteresting characters who you aren't empathetic with in the least. I was watching and rooting for the vampires to obliterate the town and all it's phony Alaskans, then sail away into the night on their big ship. For me, that would have been a happy ending to this lame movie. Guess you can tell I didn't like it that much, huh? It's a 4 out of 10 and ONLY because the vampires were cool.",4,0,3,23 November 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," A nice wrap-up to Nolan's Batman trilogy
","I much enjoyed the THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. While not being on the same level as it's predecessor (hardly any movie is), it's nonetheless a satisfying movie in it's own right. Too many people that criticize, simply do so because it's NOT the TDK. I don't view that as legitimate criticism. Anyway, TDKR is action-packed, exciting and has strong character portrayals all around. Tom Hardy is Bane, one of the few villains in Batman lore to have actually defeated Batman in combat. Hardy brings a subtle but menacing presence to the character who hold Gotham hostage. Anne Hathaway is good at Selina Kyle/Catwoman, however they could have done a little more with her character. Bale again does a fine job reprising the role of Batman, Gotham's defender. Other solid performers are again Gary Oldman as an aging Commissioner Gordon and Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth. There's also a brief appearance of Cilian Murphy in his role as Doctor Crane/Scarecrow from the previous two movies. All in all, a good final chapter to the trilogy, although I would have liked to see Batman not give up his caped persona at the end. I just don't buy Joseph Gordon-Levitt's John Blake as Batman's replacement. This part of the ending doesn't ruin the movie for me, I just didn't care for it. Overall, I give it an 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,17 November 2016
Blade Runner," A Sci-Fi Masterpiece
","Netflix has the theatrical release, whereas TBS would always show the director's cut, which was not the better version of the movie. BLADE RUNNER is beautiful to watch! It paints a stark picture of a future where man and machine are arrayed against each other in the struggle for survival. The character of Decker is one of Harrison Ford's best portrayals. He's an ace at his job but also very alone in world. He seems to have more in common with the Replicant androids than other human beings. There's the lingering question of whether he's human or not by legions of fans. I say yes but others disagree. Sean Young is good too, and sexy! Rutger Hauer's most memorable moment in movies comes in BLADE RUNNER. Based on Philip K. Dick's story 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?', it has left an indelible mark on the genre of Sci-Fi movies.",10,0,4,29 October 2016
Godzilla," A better Godzilla movie
","I saw this movie last year and really liked it. Quite different than any Godzilla movies I watched as a kid. There's much more of a story told from the character's viewpoint and the final battle scene was worth watching the entire movie. I found Elizabeth Olson's character and that of her son's character to be essential worthless. That's not a knock on the actors, just a knock on their roles. They don't really add anything except a love/family angle to the story. That's been overdone in blockbuster movies and less of that, more of the scientists interacting and discussing Godzilla's origin/nature would have been better. Taylor's soldier/son/husband character could have used a bit more depth as well. He's just kind of running in place with his role throughout. Overall, it's a fun movie and the giant monster battle scenes are good. I give it a 6 out of 10. Not a great movie but a good one.",7,0,1,29 October 2016
Moon," Makes you ask 'Who am I, really?'
","I had seen this in 2010 and recently purchased the DVD, re-watching it (twice) this past weekend. It is as powerful now as it was 6 years ago.Sam Rockwell plays the role of Sam Bell, the lone human occupant of a mining base on the Moon, his only companion being a robot helper named GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). Sam's job is to retrieve Helium 3 from the mining machines roving around on the Moon's surface and send it back to Earth, to be used for clean energy. He's nearing the end of a three year contract and is anxious to return home to his wife and young daughter, only glimpsed through video messages sent to the base. With just two weeks left, he begins having strange visions of a young woman. Sam sees her twice, once inside the base and later outside when he's driving towards one of the mining machines. This second encounter distracts him and causes him to crash. He later wakes up in the base infirmary, being watched over and questioned by GERTY. From there the movie goes in a very unexpected direction. MOON is a different kind of Sci-Fi movie, one that examines the probing question of just 'who' we really are and the purpose of our existence. Are we a singular person, unique in the universe or are we a collection of memories, both physical and mental? Rockwell does a masterful job at displaying the anger, tension and uncertainty of a man housed in his own prison far from all he knows or thinks he knows. MOON is much more than your typical astronaut movie. There is a crystallizing scene that makes my eyes well with tears (both a pivotal moment in the movie and nobly touching), where GERTY reveals to Sam that his lingering fears are for real. You will watch this one in silence and then watch it again. It's a movie you share with others, a definite 10!",10,1,2,29 November 2016
The Martian," Basically it's 'Cast Away' set on another planet
","I saw this movie with friends and enjoyed it, although I found it to be strangely reminiscent of CAST AWAY, staring Tom Hanks.The best parts are when the stranded Astronaut uses his scientific knowledge growing potatoes to stretch his food supply and his calculations in seeking out and finding/reactivating the Pathfinder lander. Those scenes illustrate the kind of psychology one would need to survive while being stranded on Mars with limited resources. Damon does a fine job in these moments. The rest of the movie is kind of melodramatic, even thought Jeff Daniels made a convincing NASA Administrator. The ending is a bit silly, as tearing his spacesuit would have killed him rather quickly, not propelled him far enough to reach the ship commander. A lot of that was just the melodrama to make it more exciting. I understand the book ending was much different.Overall a decent movie and an excellent one for planetary colonization enthusiasts to watch. There is a good bit of science fact mixed with the fiction part. It's basically CAST AWAY, except on Mars. For movies of this genre, I prefer the setting of MOON as a more possible scenario with the mining operation. Just my personal take.",7,0,1,21 November 2016
