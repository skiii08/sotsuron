Scarface," epic,entertaining,excellent
","when the atmospheric giorgio murder score starts and the archive footage begins to film begins to feel epic. then tony montana is introduced and immediately you are drawn to this cocky, smug character. al pacinos acting is amazing and the characters subtle transformation from ambitous criminal to an unfeeling addict is incredible.this film is very entertaining but has depth as the characters are well developed.sequencing are shot very well( chainsaw sequence,push it to the limit) the film can go from light humour to tense violent moments to bleakness a very stylish and memorable film with iconic moments and it is one of the greatestgangster films ever",10,0,1,22 August 2008
