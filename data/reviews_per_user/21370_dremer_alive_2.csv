Mission: Impossible III," MI:3 is Gripping
","What a well made and tremendously entertaining movie. You hardly run across an action-packed film loaded with great acting and emotional intensity. That is what this movie delivers, down to the smallest fragment of awesomeness. Right when the movie finished, after I was able to finally take a deep breath, I said, 'I want to see it again.' NO, not another day, I literally wanted them to re-insert the film again, and replay it with no delay. I wanted to be in Ethans world one more time--that is how well the movie involves you, and owns you for its 2 hours and 6 minutes. I suggest you go see it-actually, I insist. You will love this movie.",10,1,4,6 May 2006
Casino Royale," Fantastic!!!
","This movie was entertaining, intriguing, well written, and excellently performed by the many sharp actors cast for their roles. It took you through emotions of Awe, Bewilderment, Excitement, Romance, Vengeance, Suspense, Lust, Psychosis, Pain, and Hate. It was a movie worth your $10 at the Box office, and well worth watching again and again. Don't miss one of the Greatest Bond movies ever made. You'll Enjoy Daniel Craig's performance as a well equipped Bond, able to handle Anything--from car chases, to foot chases, from shoot-outs, to charming the Ladies. He proved to be worthy to carry 007 into this next generation of movie goers lining up to see a Bond able to keep up with the likes of Matt Damon in the Bourne Series, Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible 3, and so on. Though Pierce Brosnan was an excellent, sophisticated Bond, Daniel Craig brings sophistication, class, and a rogue, edgy and very physical side to what the Bond character has been missing. A reboot of the Bond Series is an exact commentary to what Casino Royale has done.",9,2,5,3 December 2006
