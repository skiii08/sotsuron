Iron Man 3," Good but its no Maggie Weller
","Iron Man 3 is the final instalment of the Iron Man trilogy and in general, a decently crafted film, from a non-marvel fan perspective but proved itself at the box office and became the most popular film out of the series: making over 1 billion dollars. After watching both Iron man and the sequel, I didn't know what to expect from the third and what more they could add to it, non the less the idea of a third film got me very excited. It features all of the actors playing main characters from the previous films such as Robert Downey Jr as 'Tony Stark', Gwenyth Paltrow as 'Pepper Pots' e.c.t. In general, it was a film of high expectations to the world and all marvel fans particularly. It took a different approach to the other Iron Man films, taking to the idea of a thought to be huge terrorist threat, acted by Ben Kingsley to in fact a drunken, idiotic actor just as the distraction, which replaced the typical huge marvel villain of the film. Personally, I thought it was enjoyable, thrilling but also funny which from the presence of Robert Downey Jr, humour was beforehand expected in the film. I wasn't very impressed with the idea of the villain as I felt the Mandarin in the film had little meaning and took the traditional 'marvel story' out of the equation. Moving on to the action side of the film, as you would expect in a Marvel production the action scenes were both explosive and high paced, edging you further and further off of your seat the longer it went on. Next, the main character which makes the film what it is, Tony Stark played by Robert Downey Jr, once again his role as Iron Man brings the edge of humour and brings another outstanding performance, his classy one liners never fail to impress however throughout the film, he is never really in the Iron Man suit, which in my eyes is a big disappointment as the action in the Iron Man suit is what I look forward too. Some of the audience would agree with me when I see you pay to see the suit. Another issue I had with the film is the fact that a majority of the characters just vanish at certain moments in the film, for example the kid that name no one actually remembers is introduced towards the middle of the film, 15 minutes later he doesn't appear again until right at the end. This also outlines the Disney side of the film involving a child that actually saves Tony's life at one point, but that isn't very important. Besides these small problems, I thought it was funny, action packed and a very enjoyable film. In conclusion I felt this film was extremely good, a tad confusing because of the story line, but in as a whole, a really enjoyable production. Unless you are a die-hard Marvel fan this film should be to your expectations of an action film. I fully recommend this film to anyone who liked either the first or second, or any of Marvels films for that matter.",7,0,1,9 October 2013
