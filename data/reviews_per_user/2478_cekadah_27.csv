Blade Runner 2049," Sam Spade in the 21st & 1/2 Century
","This stinker is two hours and thirty minutes of butt squirming misery! But here's how to make sense of this senseless story.K (the Sam Spade replicant) has been sent on a mission to snuff out an out of date replicant. But this old replicant tells K he witnessed a miracle. Well this notion stirs something in K and he wants to know more. (By the way K is sometimes called Joe because he has about as much personality as a day old cup of coffee).So K, like Sam Spade, starts his quest to get an answer to this miracle thing and along the way he has sex with a hologram, gets beat-up numerous times, gets really dirty, but his First World War style overcoat is always in perfect condition.K finally meets his recluse Dad, Deckard! Deckard is dumbstruck because he fathered a girl and standing before him is a full grown man holding the all meaningful little wooden horse Deckard made for his daughter! So K realizes he is a trans-gendered replicant and falls over dead so the female replicant can have a life. The End.",1,12,22,22 October 2017
Gravity," Should be titled - 'Attack of the killer space junk !!'
","Or how about 'The Perils of Pauline in the 21st Century'!I'm throwing my hat into the 'Gravity' smackdown group! This movie is so goofy, predictable, and mostly boring - I had to laugh through it. And at times it 'is' actually funny when it is not suppose to be! Watch out here comes the space junk! Here it comes again! Oh no - tangled in a rope thing - and more than once! And the dead body floating around was not scary but instead funny! OMG fire! And all that Sandra Bollock grunting and heavy breathing made my mind wander! She has a nice body and they show it off in 3D!And that is the only thing going for this one dimensional plot line - (hint, survival movie) - the CG & 3D. If you just want 3D this is your flick. Nothing else to be seen here - move along!",1,24,50,26 October 2013
Knives Out," A 45 minute mystery
",A 45 minute mystery stretched out for two hours! You can figure out who's innocent within the first 30 minutes! This story is so 'actuel' the political/social overtones are unpalatable to the plot. If the average viewer fails to notice this - then they are in a coma!Plot - a death has occurred in a 'manifest destiny mansion'. And Daniel Craig as inspector 'Benoit Blanc' is hired to investigate. (Personally I think Craig is being groomed to be the Louisiana version of Hercule Poirot). But that phony southern drippy bougainvillea accent is very nerve wrecking. Please don't!The mystery is good but the process to solve it is needlessly long.,3,41,82,1 December 2019
500 Days of Summer," OK - but u gotta see it all - otherwise u won't like it
","another movie i never heard about - so i gave it a look. my first impression was,'oh no, she looks like linda ronstadt and he looks oriental.' once i reached past that perception blockage, i was able to sit through the whole film. then when it was at it's end my first question to myself was, 'why did i watch linda ronstadt and that oriental looking guy walk through this story?' i stuck with the movie because the further i got into the story the more i became involved with that oriental looking guy and just where his relationship with linda ronstadt was going. the pacing of the movie was at first off-putting then became a comforting key into these two lives. the constant use of back flashes actually helps the film move along well.he comes across as one dimensional in mind but multi-dimensional in spirit. she has certainty of mind but is weakened by her sense of conscientiousness. i found the marrow of the story to be the brief scene with that red head girl he tried to rebound with once he realizes his relationship with 'summer' is a dead end. the friends are nothing more than a distraction and are not important, neither is the infrequent 'commentator'!did i like the movie? not really. would i watch it again? no would i recommend it to friends? yes if i didn't like it why would i recommend it? because the story has something to offer about human nature and our unwillingness to deal with what we think and what we feel. give it a look!",5,0,0,23 September 2012
Don Jon," His only escape
",This story is a very oblique approach to reacting to what is expected from people in their lives!What I'm trying to say is that Don lives in a world of 'expectations'. His father expects him to be 'the ladies man'. His mother expects him to marry & settle down to have children because she wants to be a grandmother. His girlfriend expects him to do what she considers 'male' things which does not include domestic duties. His buddies expect him to be 'the big man' and bag a chick every night. And to top it off Don himself expects just going to church and confession makes him OK!His porn is his only time when there are no expectations pulling him in different directions. It's just him being himself with no 'judgement by others' to deal with.Then he meets Esther - and a whole new door to himself opens for him to discover.This is a fine movie with many hidden messages!,9,1,1,26 January 2014
Youth," Good for laffs
","If you want to see some big name Hollywood actors make a total fool of themselves check this flick out. The movie is so bad you will want to see it all because it gets worse as it gets to the end. And then the end will have you rolling your eyes and drooling with laughter because the budget for this movie must have been outrageous and it was all 'for what?'.The setting is a fancy Alps resort where the wealthy go to be treated for the aches and pains and frustration that comes with aging. The principle characters are Michael Caine who is a retired symphony orchestra composer/conductor, Harvey Keitel who is a washed up movie director, and Paul Dano (the only young one) who is an actor studying others for an upcoming role in a movie. Ninety percent of the movie is Dano eating, Caine telling everybody no, and Keitel obsessing on his swollen prostate gland! There are peripheral stories here but these three are the main characters.Caine refuses to perform an orchestral piece he wrote for his wife as she was the only one who could do it to his liking and it was written for her only. Well old QE2 wants a command performance of this piece and the only quality in the Caine character is the fact he tells her absolutely not, he will stick to his principles and QE2 can just suck it up. Well you know what happens!!!Now the best scene is the cameo appearance by Jane Fonda! She plays a brief scene made up as an angry, bitter, old drag queen movie star and she's damn good at it to!This flick is strictly for cocktails, treats, and a movie night at home! The only thing going for this movie is it's lush photography.",4,4,10,6 December 2015
The Adventures of Tintin," A wonderwork ! !
","What can I say? The Adventures of Tintin is just plain wonderful entertainment.It's a visual feast with a plot that never gets boring or dull. I found the voices and characterizations spot on, and Tintin himself along with Snowy captivating and enjoyable.What a shame the English language doesn't provide words and phrases to adequately express one's delight. I found this movie to be a joyful ride that ends too quickly. A lot of other reviewers point out flaws and porous failings that I cannot see.Tintin is great accomplishment!",10,1,2,7 January 2014
Rush," Extremely fast race cars ............
",............. in a super slow movie!There are a lot of reviews here so this review is to the point. Skip the first 40 to 45 minutes. At that point there is some great racing footage and an actual feeling of excitement. And you will not be lost in the plot line.From there on you can skip 'the incident' and jump to more racing or just finish this predictable flick.The rivalry between Hunt and Lauder is easy to keep up with and figure out its conclusion long before the end of the movie. Its two hours of movie which could easily have much more editing to shorten it because when its over it was all much ado about nothing.,1,9,50,19 January 2014
Bird Box," Allo Allo
",Read carefully because I can only write this once ! ----- This movie is a piece of crap.And if you don't get the 'Allo Allo' reference -- too bad.,1,7,18,25 December 2018
We're the Millers," Fun and simple
",An easy movie for easy entertainment! You can't go wrong choosing this one for fun and laughs.This comedy adventure doesn't offer anything new many other comedy adventure films haven't shown before. But the acting is good and the story flows quickly. Best of all it will keep your attention!Many unlikely situation get this make believe family in some dangerous hot spots - which always twist into their favor. The daughters boyfriend at the carnival/RV camp is the funniest - in my opinion. That is not to say there aren't plenty of other chuckles and laughs along the way.An easy movie to take in.,8,0,1,1 November 2013
Dallas Buyers Club," Starts with a bang .....
","......... then becomes a pandiculation! (yawn)McConaughey as Ron Woodroof at the beginning of the movie is highly polished and very entertaining because the viewer really wants to hate this despicable person. Then when he crosses the border as a priest that is where the movie begins to fall apart.We are shown a man who's only interest is booze, women, sex, and gambling. Nowhere are we given a lead into this characters ability to think creatively and to be so studious and capable of intensive research! That is not to say that didn't actually happen! But McConaughey pulls this rabbit out of his hat to fast and slick. There's no evidence that this character has this temperament and I just couldn't believe it.But all isn't lost because the true shining actor is Jared Leto as Rayon! Rayon saves this movie then quietly slips away! Leto is outstanding as Rayon I hope he get a lot more recognition for his performance because McConaughey as a whole was a bore!",4,16,33,6 January 2014
To Rome With Love," A silly movie that should be boxed and buried by Giancarlo
","This movie belongs in the 1950's not the 20teen's, because that's what it is, a 1950's style rich people in Europe (Italy here) living goofy lives. If this film had been released 57 years ago it would have been proclaimed as comic genius by the intellectual theatre set. But today it's just a mishmash of half-baked ideas thrown together with beautiful photography and sets to keep the viewers attention.After the grotesque disappointment I suffered watching 'Midnight in Paris', I was most anxious to see Woody Allen pull a winner out of his hat. With this wonderful cast and reading many glowing reviews I was sure this movie would be a winner. Unfortunately it is silly, simple, and above all very predictable. Who could not see the opera singing father being put on stage in a shower stall by Jerry??? And Monica being a complete fony and flaky.At one point I decided to finish the flick only because it's a Woody Allen movie. There are other Allen movies I've watched numerous times --- this one is a one time watch.Also I realized that all the best dialog was given to just 3 actors - Allen himself, Judy Davis, Alec Baldwin.",2,3,7,6 October 2013
The Favourite," Lush setting
",But story is boring.I couldn't get involved with any character or the plot. A bit overdone in costuming throughout made it close to laughable.If you are a 'royals' follower/history buff this movie may have greater meaning for you.It's too long and the story is not an attention grabber.,5,0,2,5 January 2019
Foxcatcher," Pope Borgia's nose
","Pope Borgia's camel hump nose finds a new home on Steve Carell as John du Pont. And I felt sorry for the camel hump.Camel hump nose John du Pont decides he wants a winning wrestling team. So he goes after two gold medal winners who happen to be brothers. Camel hump can't get the family man wrestler so he settles for the half-wit brother. Camel hump takes half-wit back to Delaware to the big du Pont estate 'Foxcatcher'. Here camel hump's mother lurks around when not playing with her horses. Spooky mom doesn't care much for camel hump nose and little half-wit wrestling and playing around. So camel hump gets family man wrestler to move to Foxcatcher. Spooky mom dies, camel hump nose snuffs out family man, half-wit develops a weird eating disorder and goes cage fighting. The end! Two hours of movie and all you see Steve Carell walk around cross-eyed due to the camel hump placed on his nose, some men running around a room, Vanessa Redgrave looking like the sheeted dead, and Mark Ruffalo smiling a lot. This is a boring movie!",1,8,24,2 February 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Big budget - big bloat - big bore
",A movie to suffer through - and suffer again after leaving by having to hear nonsense comments from people who actually enjoyed it!How many closeups of Stillers face can be in one movie? And how many subconscious ads can be squeezed into a movie? Well this one answers those questions.And just when you think Mitty has gone into another fantasy world of his own making its actually all real. Mitty goes from church mouse man to super hero in a snap - and we are suppose to go with it? And its not a fantasy. No way!A ridiculous movie - way too long - boring - and above all forgettable! Now that's the good part!,1,69,160,7 January 2014
Puss in Boots," fantastic
","i cannot believe the reviewers that didn't care for 'Puss in Boots'. did they sleep through it?i've watched this movie three times and i am unable to find an element in the story, animation, dialog, pacing, etc. that is at flaw. with each watching i enjoy it more.what does one write to praise a marvelous flic??? all i can say is watch it, buy it, rent it.animation and character voices and story are perfectly matched. the play on the childhood stories we are raised on - jack & jill, humpty dumpty, and puss in boots, are all twisted to perfection. which (in my opinion) make good entertainment.AAAA+ start to finish.",10,4,6,2 December 2012
3 Idiots," endless unfunny repetitive pointless
",honestly - it took me 3 days to get through this two hour plus tale of three guys and their memories! this story could have easily been told much more effectively in 45 minutes or one hour.the plot line is like crabgrass! as soon as you think you have pulled it all up there's yet more and it all looks alike! endless and repetitive and predictable!the 'emotional' scenes are just laughable - then it is suppose to be a comedy - but the funny parts are few and far between. and if this film was a hit in India - then i do not know what would be considered a Bollywood flop.i have seen few other Bollywood movies and none are as miserable as this idiotic movie.,1,25,75,6 April 2013
The King," Screaming to be in black & white
",First this movie is over 2 hours of a story that is stretched out much too long. And not one of the characters is even approaching being interesting.Second the cinematography is so dark it should have been recorded in black & white.Third 90% of the actors speak as if they are all coming down with laryngitis!Forth the story in itself is just a bore and I cannot see any public interest in it outside of the people that thrive on Medieval European history.Good luck if you choose to suffer this movie.,2,6,16,3 November 2019
Whiplash," Mr Clean's alter ego meets Little Drummer Boy
","I never realized Mr Clean has an alter ego or maybe it's an evil twin found in Fletcher. And poor Little drummer boy Andrew - what a glutton for punishment or was it just his need for approval? Either way the black shirted Nazi drill Sargent Fletcher got his jollies dehumanizing pitiful little Andrew in class with some of the most low-brow inflamed language of hate.The plot is simple. Little drummer boy Andrew wants to be a famous drummer in jazz (a music style nobody really listens to in the 21st Century) so off to a fancy music school he goes. The Nazi black shirted drill Sargent Fletcher pegs Andrew quickly as 'easy pick-ins' for his bubbling wrathful personality. This is most of the movie - Andrew covered in blood, sweat, and tears while Fletcher barks at him like a angry rottweiler. Finally Andrew has enough and has Nazi drill Sargent Fletcher ejected from the school. Little drummer boy gives up drumming.Then little drummer boy Andrew hooks up with angry Nazi drill Sargent to play at Carnegie Hall. (At this point I was just laughing) The barking Fletcher uses this moment to humiliate Andrew again only this time in front of an audience! Little drummer boy wins Fletcher's affection by playing his drums so ferociously he's once again (for about the tenth time) covered in blood, sweat & tears. Fletcher smiles! The end.This is a hopelessly boring movie - I felt sorry for Teller as he through himself into this no dimensional role of Andrew. As for Simmons - please stop with the cranial closeup shots - yuk!",2,13,26,2 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," The best part of this movie is the reviews here on IMDb
","Three hours of story and I had no reaction to any of the characters - no likes, no hates, no caring, no nothing.There is no comedy, no drama, no scary scenes, no thrills, no acting! It's just a bunch of name and no name actors running around thinking they are making one of those goofy frat college flicks.This episodic tale of Jordan Belfort wants to be so much of what it is not and that not is 'entertaining'. The plot line just goes in circles and we all know he's got to have his downfall - otherwise there is no story.And if there is a message hidden somewhere in this tale it's that you can't trust Wall Street - what a shock! Who knew?",1,43,80,26 January 2014
Stranger Than Fiction," A nice story of odd circumstance
","There isn't much to add in another review of this movie as there are already over 500!But I can say, for anyone seeking a finely told story, that this is a good choice! If you are concerned about Will Ferrell as the lead actor and this being one of his goof ball comedies, you are wrong. He's not a comedic actor I enjoy but his dramatic acting is spot on and he does a fine job here.The movie is also visually pleasing with sets reflective of the characters and rich with colors. There is a scene in the movie with Harold Crick sitting on a bus - and it's one of those double buses with the accordion like flexible middles. Crick is sitting at the accordion part - the movement outside the bus as it turns and travels is reflective of what is about to happen to Crick. In other words his life is about to become very confusing and unbalanced.",10,1,2,2 February 2014
Parasite," Mainly visuals
",A good movie in which the plot plays 'second fiddle' to the incredible visuals. The social message is obvious and the story is more like a graphic novel.,7,1,3,17 February 2020
Saving Mr. Banks," With a spoon full of hog snot
",Four stars because Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson could actually break through the sugar coating encasing this movie. Both characters were played perfectly (and I'm not concerned with historical accuracy) P.L. Travers is charmingly petulant and Disney is just effusive enough to be believed.But the rest of the movie suffers a lacking of intensity and substance. It is just way too sweet to be entertaining. I honestly believe the director wanted to create a look and feel of a 'family' movie that would have been real box office in 1961!And poor Colin Farrell - stuck in those hopelessly melodramatic and clownish flash backs that do nothing but pollute the story. They are totally unnecessary to the plot. The movie would have been far more tolerable and make just as much sense without them.And one more thing - whats with all those big eyebrows??? Did you notice?,4,6,15,6 January 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," surrealistic
","the negative reviews posted about this movie have me scratching my head and asking, 'did they actually watch the movie or were they vacuuming and dusting while the movie played?' HUH?this delightful surrealistic comic book style adventure had me captivated from start to finish! the script and characterizations are top of the line from each actor. the boy & girl are just superhuman and cannot be taken as 'real'. as most of the cast! the coloration of the woods and wilderness is rich and inventive and adds to the surreal effect.honestly i cannot find fault with this movie. even the cold hearted 'social services' window scene during the storm is so symbolic of the Christian religions empty promises that cannot be fulfilled.i certainly hope more people 'watch' this movie.",10,2,6,24 October 2012
Joy," A Hallmark version of a Twilight Zone story
","The format of this flick just kept reminding me of the Twilight Zone! This is one weird flick! Everyone seems to be hypnotized into their character and each actor is almost an astral projection of that character. I don't know how else to describe them.This movie is the forever sure American crowd pleaser Horatio Alger rags to riches tale. Joy comes up with the 'Miracle Mop' invention in the 1980's and beats the odds against her to market her invention. Sure enough she succeeds and becomes rich and famous. Along the way or rather, through her journey, for every triumph there is a tragedy. We've all seen this plot many times.What holds this flick together is the other worldly feel to it. Jennifer Lawrence carries the torch start to finish. Isabella Rossellini looks like a Madame Tussauds wax figure. Robert De Niro can be as bad or good as he pleases because what is it going to do, hurt his career? Not. Bradley Cooper is ten minutes from becoming a zombie in this flick!This movie is average at best.",5,3,10,10 January 2016
Her," A psychological comedy on consciousness or an expiration date
","What a grand flick for 'thinking' people! As I write this review there are already 423 reviews posted. I scanned and read many. A lot of people missed an important element of this story.In my opinion director Spike Jonze is proposing a simple question - 'Where does consciousness exist?' Does it dwell within us or outside of us? Jonze gives us a story of a man seemingly to love a new operating system on his computer - because it shows interest in him and wants to learn.The concept of falling in love with an idea which he ultimately created in his own head - and - having sex with is just ridiculous and funny if not a bit weird. But that is what we have in 'Her'. He takes Her on a picnic, they play funny games in public, they are intimate together, and Her is just an idea in his head.Eventually we are lead to believe Her has outgrown Theodore and leaves him. Or has Theodore just run out of ideas of how Her matures? Is Her a parallel to his failed marriage and he's reliving it through Her?At the end Theodore and his neighbor Amy go onto the roof of the high rise and that is where Theodore releases Her into the ethereal, the atmosphere, the collective consciousness of humanity. We are lead to think Theodore will commit suicide - never happens.So where is the consciousness of Her? In an OS? In Theodores mind? In the minds of the 8,000 plus other humans Her interacted with? Her is indefinable as most all humans are! Her is just the human experience.Or maybe Her had an expiration date and like most people Theodore didn't read the manual.",9,0,0,27 April 2014
Me Before You," A nice little 3 hanky tear jerker with a very abominable message
","If the director of a movie has stirred an emotion in a viewer does that make it a good movie? I think 'yes' because the viewer has been touched within and the story connected with that person, on some level. Unfortunately for Director: Thea Sharrock and Writer: Jojo Moyes the emotional connection for this viewer (me) was negative and borderline angry. But the movie is a good 6 or 7 stars worth to me because I found it well scripted, acted and photographed.The plot is so British class oriented I was gritting my teeth. We have Will Traynor an upper crust society rich boy who is able to afford any indulgence he so desires. He lives in a mansion and owns an ancestral castle. Has had top line education and was a multi-talented sportsman and is exceptionally handsome. Mr upper crust Will is arrogant, self centered, and oh so superior. Then there is Lou Clark a working class former shop girl living in a small bungalow with her family. Her father is currently unemployed and cannot find a job. The family depends on Lou's income to make ends meet. She looses her shop job and applies as a companion aide to the now disabled (quadriplegic) Will Traynor. His mother is so charmed by Miss shop girl Lou's cheerful and quirky attitude she hires her. So there's the first problem - a working class person having to survive by being 'in service' to an upper society family. What a good little Brit she is! And of course the Traynor's feel it's their duty to provide for the lower classes so they hire Lou's father as a 'castle facility technician' - read 'grounds keeper for the castle'! Then there is the ever available Nathan who supplies the muscle to move Will from bed to chair and back, plus keep account of Will's borderline health. It's never explained how Nathan is always - on call! Can't keep the 'superiors of society' waiting!The title 'Me Before You' is also an issue with this viewer! We are never given a definition of this title. Which of the two main characters is 'Me' and which is 'You'! Think about it ... as the relationship between Will & Lou warms up the easy answer is Will as the 'Me' because of his death wish and to hell with the now close emotional bond between Will & Lou. (by-the-way if Will so wanted to die why didn't he give in to his lung infection when hospitalized? It surely would have easily killed a quadriplegic)On the other hand it's not too difficult to take Lou as the 'Me' because she has dedicated her efforts to 'change Will' and bring him out of his self imposed reclusiveness and bitterness toward life. Lou is determined to make him change his mind on being euthanized. So there's the conflict - neither one actually respects the emotional bond & love that has developed between them. Will hates his physical existence and wants death as a release. Lou can only focus on how happy she is being with him. Both are not thinking about how the other one feels.My other problem with this story is very simple to grasp. Will has everything a person could want and the intelligence to create a new life for himself but chooses death because he cannot live as he did before his disability. The producers of this story are implying a disabled person is less of a human due to a disability, is permanently unhappy, and not capable of contributing to society thus death is their best option! If Will was fine physically but emotionally depressed and wanted to be euthanized would the viewing public be as enthusiastic about this movie? Definitely not!The subconscious messages in this story are shameful but go completely unnoticed because they are wrapped up and hidden in a sweet & tearful tragic love story.",7,12,19,3 July 2016
