Angels & Demons," Suspenseful book-to-movie adaptation
","I like this way better than the Da Vinci Code. The movie is an adaptation of Dan Brown's Robert Langdon's book 'Angels & Demons', which actually preceded the Da Vinci Code. I watched the movie first prior to reading the book. Before reading, I thought the movie was fast-paced and coherent. After reading, I thought the movie did a great job in basing off the book.Firstly, the cinematography is beautiful. The setting is in Rome and the Vatican City, and the night scenes across the city is gorgeous. I was very impressed the movie crew recreated the St. Peter's Square and many of the churches to great detail. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer adds to the effect of a grandiose setting.Secondly, the plot is equally captivating as the book. The story is tight, well-explained, with a twist that leads to a satisfying ending. I was engrossed in the movie for every second.",Null,0,1,9 June 2016
John Wick," Tight plot, smooth execution, stylish cinematic
","Wow. Watching this is so satisfying. A straight to the point film from beginning to end, no moment is wasted and I loved every single second of this film. Stylistically, the film is carried out beautifully. The action sequences are intense. The idea of this underground world based in the Continental, use specific gold coin currency, and their special waste disposal service is as intriguing as John Wick the character himself. What surprised me the most was also how funny the dialogues are when you least expects it from Viggo and John Wick. This is easily my favorite action movie of all time. I wish the sequel is about Wick's backstory on how he left Viggo.",Null,0,3,10 June 2016
Gravity," Visually stunning but not exciting
",I like this and I don't like this. The movie is visually gorgeous. I always loved the idea of being in space.Two things I didn't like: (1) What is the purpose of having Clooney's character? He just dies near the beginning of the film. Yet I originally thought this movie was about Bullock and Clooney. I wondered if there was really no way for him to get back to the station? He traversed all the way from the shuttle! (2) I was expecting something more exciting and action-oriented and more two-people dialogue. I get it's stressful in its own sense she needs to figure out way to survive. But I was expecting something more than just floating from one space shuttle to another and listening to Bullock talking with herself.,Null,0,2,10 June 2016
Dear John," Disappointing chemistry between two leads
","I never read the book, but I've watched the Notebook before. This cannot compete with the Notebook both in terms of plot and characters. The romance between John and Savannah is very disappointing. Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfield lacks chemistry together. And because a lot of the scenes are through letter reading, it can get boring real quick. The letter reading also meant a barrier in showing raw emotions.What's more memorable for me from this entire movie was the father-son relationship between John and his father. The scene when John was reading his letter to his father in the hospital was very powerful and heartbreaking. Kudos to Tatum in delivering such heart-wrenching performance. If you are watching this movie, that is the scene you should be watching for.",Null,0,1,9 June 2016
Suicide Squad," More questions than answers, don't take this too seriously
","I'm not a comic book reader so I knew nothing about the Suicide Squad before this movie. This is nowhere as polished as existing Marvel films but it has some of its highlights (though a lot of it already got highlighted in the trailer).The movie started off messy and fragmented. Character introductions were bias with most screen time spent on Will Smith's character Deadshot and Margot Robbie's character Harley Quinn. And then they just quickly glimpsed over Boomerang, El Diablo, Killer Croc. Katana showed up from nowhere, and Slipknot disappeared as quickly as he appeared. You can say Suicide Squad is a pretty unmemorable squad featuring only two stars, Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Despite the movie's effort in putting more explanation into Deadshot and Harley Quinn's backstories...I feel I still don't really understand who Harley Quinn really is. And Cara Delevingne's character Enchantress. Who is she really? What's her true motivation? Nothing is developed with that character. Cara is fitting for the emotionless scary bad witch role, but her mean eyebrows ruined her distressed girl act as Dr. June Moone. And then there's the plot. The way they set up the plot in the beginning was incomplete due to poor transitions and explanations. The idea of Waller getting the approval to assemble the Squad by showing off Enchantress' magical powers seemed so stupid...it looked like the screenwriters took an easy way out to move along the plot. How the 'villains' got defeated in the end seemed really stupid too. The movie is basically saying that all-powerful 4000 years old magical beings (Enchantress and Incubus) were defeated by a bomb and a heart that was easily stolen. There was so much more potential to these characters than what was shown.The movie found more coherence once the Squad found its purpose with the rescue mission and wasn't interrupted by random backstory interjections. But the questionable plot left me with still more questions than answers: How come Waller just popped up again with no scratches or battle scars? What happened to the little army of mutants created by the witch before their final scene of defeat? What is Diablo??! Is he non-human because I was pretty surprised when he just suddenly turned into a giant and fire monster. Where was his backstory? The lack of explanation or character development made it really hard for me to care about them when they die. Now some positives that stuck with me: - There were some amazing performances by Leto as Joker, Robbie as Harley Quinn, and Smith as Deadshot. Harlely Quinn had some good action sequences - The humour was pretty good. (Inconsistent but still good). - Sick soundtrackVerdict: Still a no brainer fun action movie to watch if you don't hold yourselves too seriously over its flaws.",Null,6,16,5 August 2016
Interstellar," Stellar at certain parts
","I have mixed feelings about this one. The beginning was very slow in order to set up the main theme of this movie, which is about the daughter-father relationship. But it was too slow. They could have cut many of the scenes to speed up the plot.The real cool part starts when they were traveling in outer space and exploring the planets. I especially love to see the concept of space-time relativity in works (that time moves slower in space). Visiting that first planet where they thought waves were mountains was visually stunning.However, the idea of fifth dimension and the concept of future humans were too abstract for me. And I thought that Cooper ended up surviving was too good to be true.Certain parts of the soundtrack I'm not a fan off. The music is too high pitched. I still enjoyed Gravity's visual effects and sound effects more. In conclusion, I was surprised by the family theme and enjoyed the space aspect of the movie but this movie is way too long.",Null,1,1,10 June 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man," Less than amazing but good enough
","I was a bit skeptical of the remake having liked the previous Spider-man trilogy. After watching this, I think they made a good choice for Andrew Garfield to be Spider-man. As for Gwen Stacy, I still preferred Kirsten Dunst over Emma Stone.One thing that bothered me about this movie is that the bad guy is not bad enough. The antagonist is Dr. Curt Conners who turned into the Lizard through mutation. But I find the Lizard's motivation is very strained because the Lizard's violence also came from DNA mutation. And randomly he wanted to turn all humans into lizards? It's so random. What's worse is in the end, the Lizard doesn't even die, he just gets put in jail. But on the other hand Captain Stacy dies, in which I think his death is completely unjustified. Captain Stacy didn't even appear in much of the film until the end when he decided to help our Spider-man. Yet soon after, he dies.Overall, this film has it's good parts that lives up to previous Spider-man film but it lacks a wow factor to bring Spider-man up to the next level.",Null,0,3,9 June 2016
Inside Out," A clever tale about real emotions
","My favorite animation since The Incredibles. Thank you Pixar! I didn't expect this film to be so funny, touching, and deep. The incredible setting of the mind is creative and fun to explore. I love the physical portrayal of the value system, the long-term/short-term memories, the train of thought, the abstract world, the imagination and so much more. There's a lot of visualization of concepts that I thought was really clever. For example, when Riley lost her train of thought, the train to brain control room collapsed in the middle. This film taught me about sadness and how we handle emotions more than I realized. We can see the characters undergo changes as Riley undergo her perfect change. This film is perfect.",Null,4,21,10 June 2016
Quantum of Solace," All action, no substance
","I don't know what to think of James Bond anymore. I longer I watch, the more I feel the movie lacks substance. It's just all action action action. For example, every possible chasing scene was explored in this one. There was a chase by car, by foot, by boat, and then by plane. Yes I admit the action sequences are visually great to look at, but if you take away the action, there's not that much left of the film. If only there's a plot twist or more suspense in the actual story.And compared with other spy movies (such as Mission Impossible series), James Bond doesn't even have much cool tech. Yes, James Bond is cool in the sense he's ruthless. But almost everyone he meets dies. Either he kills them or others kill them. He steals, he squanders money on luxurious lifestyle, and he leads women on. He's very costly, in both money and human resources, to maintain! Yet strangely enough, he's still awfully popular. I say it's got to be those suits and being British.",Null,1,1,9 June 2016
The Theory of Everything," Theory of Jane Hawking
","Beautiful film of a beautiful and sad story. The cinematography and the soundtrack creates a nostalgic and timeless mood for the film.For me, this is a movie about Jane Hawking and not Stephen Hawking. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones's versions of Stephen and Jane touched me. They portrayed their struggles with many layers of emotions. Amazing actors! I didn't know anything about the Hawkings prior and was expecting a documentary of Hawking's life with loving wife. So I was surprised to see how their relationship evolved and the struggles they encountered. Contrary to popular belief, their relationship is not one one would aspire to. I honestly believe, when they were getting married, Jane was happy to be with Stephen thinking she could make his last few years happy. Yet, she didn't realize she'd devote her entire life to taking care of him.",Null,0,0,10 June 2016
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A timeless piece
","I love this movie so much because it speaks on something fundamental and precious to everyone: time. The way the story is told reminds me of Forrest Gump. And the plot reminds me of a book I read in elementary, called Turnabout by Margaret Peterson Haddix.The movie itself is a beautiful work to watch. Each character has a story to tell. The emotional tension really heightens in the end, when everyone realizes they can't escape time and when Caroline realizes the sad truth. Life is a funny thing: you can't stop it, you can't escape it, and you can't go back in time, even for Benjamin Button.One of my favorite dialogue from the movie goes like this: Benjamin Button: I was thinking how nothing lasts, and what a shame that is. Daisy: Some things last.Yes, memories and love lasts forever. I guess we really just have to cherish every moment we have with our friends and family. I think it's quite sad yet true when Mrs. Maple told Benjamin: 'We're meant to lose the people we love. How else would we know how important they are to us?' This movie is moving because it's so relatable and speaks the truth on many things in real life.",Null,1,2,9 June 2016
Jurassic World," Starts off slow but finishes strong
","My initial thoughts of the movie was meh. The kids served no greater purpose to the film other than being the subject of rescue. The beginning where the movie introduced the kids and their family problems were all very pointless and boring. The movie only became better when Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard entered the scene and became the main focal point of the movie. (Why didn't the main characters start of the film is my question).The beginning of the movie lacked direction but it gathered itself once the crisis began. Chris Pratt's character Owen is so cool. I also really like how this film has a strong female character who is smart and is equally tough. References to Jurassic Park definitely made this installment nostalgic.As a side note, the unique part of the movie promotion is that Jurassic World and Masrani have their own website as if it exists in real life. Now that's pretty cool.",Null,1,5,10 June 2016
Les Misérables," Brilliant adaptation with a talented cast
","My first time watching Les Miserables. Words cannot describe my love for this musical. From the cinematography to the music to the performance to the story, everything is a work of beauty and flowed beautifully. The talented cast performed a superb rendition of the songs. One of my favorite moment was when the Bishop gave Jean Valjean a chance of freedom.In terms of singing, Anne Hathaway was brilliant. I was surprised by Hugh Jackman. I didn't know he can sing like that. Similarly I was pleasantly surprised by Eddie Redmayne as Marius. He could sing so well. Russell Crowe was the weakest singer of the lot. There were many points throughout the movie that created a large emotional impact that just triggered the waterworks, without me even realizing. I've never watched a movie in theaters in which practically the entire theater is crying.",Null,0,0,9 June 2016
Titanic," Masterpiece that withstands the age of time
","'In every age mankind attempts to fabricate great works at once magnificent and impossible' - Titanic the musical Like the Titanic itself, this movie is a masterpiece that stands the age of time. It gives me the shivers every time I watch it. I love this film not for the love story but for the depiction of every passenger on board. You see the hopefulness in every one when boarding, not knowing what awaits ahead. And you see the tragic horrors unfold as the Titanic sunk. Cameron portrayed the human condition when everyone fights to survive and the social differences very well.Considering this is a 1997 film, it's still better than a lot of new films today, both story-wise and special effects wise.",Null,5,9,9 June 2016
Prometheus," Strangely memorable
","I didn't think I'd remember this film after watching it because I had so much annoyances with the film. Firstly, I thought the movie was a bit pointless because none of the questions that was set up in the beginning got answered. Instead a bunch of people just went to space for nothing and died there.The whole point was to find the so-called engineers as a new scientific discovery. These characters are so naive in thinking just because the aliens have human DNA doesn't mean they want to be friends with Earthling. I guess my biggest question I still have is why did the human-droid alien kill himself with those little black things in the beginning? Can someone please tell me? Out of all the characters, I like David the robot the best. I'd like to think of him as the male lead. Michael Fassbender's performance as David is superb. I also like the graphics of the space setting.Despite my annoyances, this film always come back to mind. I still really enjoyed the suspense, at times unexpected, and mindless entertainment this film provided. The exploration of a new planet and the mystery of the unknown is both creepy and fascinating. The mystery of the engineers is intriguing. The realization that you're isolated and can't escape the inevitable deadly creatures is strangely satisfying for a thriller movie. This movie gives me the same after-movie feeling as I had when I finished watching the Descent. Overall, I'm willing to overlook the flaws for a good popcorn entertainment.",Null,0,2,9 June 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," End of a magical era
","This movie already has a 90% guaranteed chance of success just with its title as the last Harry Potter film. As the last movie of the franchise, I was disappointed. I thought the beginning pace was slow and full of awkward cinematography (there's an air of awkward silence). Despite picking up pace nearing the end, it lacked any form of epicness (just think of LOTR series).Since this is the final battle between Harry Potter and Volemort, the movie is all about Harry. Harry talking, talking, doing something, and talking. All our other beloved supporting characters, even Ron and Hermione, have very little screen time. It just bothered me especially in the beginning, that Harry Potter did all the talking while Hermione and Ron just stood there like static characters.Also, Daniel Radcliffe's acting as Harry Potter doesn't look as natural as before. There's a sense of stiffness to him. But I have to applaud the belated Alan Rickman for his role as Snape. Snape's final scene is the most impressive and emotional part of the entire film for me.Perhaps after a decade of waiting for this final installment, my expectation was too high. The film still delivered a satisfying closure to a magic era of our time.",Null,0,1,8 June 2016
Cloud Atlas," You need to understand it to appreciate it
","I was so confused when watching the trailer for this, which prompted me to watch to movie so I can figure out this confusing. Then 1/4 into the movie, I was still thinking 'what exactly am I watching'. Once I realized the connections between the stories, I thought this movie is quite ingenious.How this movie came together in the end is brilliant. Although the physical link between each story is weak, the idea of the cast acting several characters in different stories to represent the theme of reincarnation is quite cool and unique. It's to show that souls can evolve and change. A bad character may be good in another life. Apparently the same setting is transformed into different uses for the different arcs, hence they are familiar yet different. I enjoyed the six mini stories. Despite all the scene changes, the plots were well developed and by the end, the characters grow on you.I'm sure there are a lot more parts I missed. I would love to re-watch it again.",Null,1,2,9 June 2016
The Great Gatsby," Ambitious and extravagant like Gatsby himself
","I'm not a fan of the book even after doing a thorough analysis on it. But this movie blew me away. It follows through with the book very closely, including some of its key symbolism. The movie did a splendid job in depicting the subtle moods and themes of the story. Visually, it was definitely a feast for the eyes: the costumes, the lavish parties, the cars.The best part of this movie has to be the perfect cast. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical of Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby. I'm so happy to be wrong. DiCaprio did a splendid job in reflecting Gatsby's character, from his ambition that led him to success to his blind hope that led to his demise. Carey Mulligan (Daisy), Elizabeth Debicki (Jordan), and Joel Edgerton (Tom) also fitted their roles very well. The only person that I do feel is sort of out of place is Tobey Maguire as Nick. I had to get use to it.We all know what happens in the end, but it still leaves me with a dreadful feeling, especially seeing it visually on the big screen. I think Luhrmann did a fantastic job in delivering the Great Gatsby both visually and through the soundtrack. I love the movie, but I still don't like reading it.",Null,0,1,9 June 2016
Atonement," Beautiful movie but not ideal for rewatching
","I first watched this in 2007 and this became one of my favorite movie because of the ending and the overall plot and its twists. It's heart-wrenching and different from your typical romance dramas. I'm bias for the two main characters Keira Knightley and James McAvoy. I saw my rooted couple torn apart then back together then *BAM* a plot twist again saying just kidding, they're not together after all.I have to give credit to Saoirse Ronan for portraying the core of Briony so well that I am reminded of Briony every time I see Saoirse the actress. The Briony character is the one that causes me so much distress watching this movie because it was her false accusation that took away the happiness of others. Yet in the very end, she says: 'I gave them their happiness.' It's characters like Briony that makes a movie good and frustrating to watch.I rewatched this again in 2011 and I didn't like the film as much as I remembered I had. Perhaps I was judging the film solely on its great ending twist. Or perhaps it's because I already know all the plot the second time I'm watching this so the excitement from the unknown is gone. Either way, I found the movie moved at a very slow pace. The middle part where Robbie was at war was dragged on to the point of boring. I seriously think the movie is still as good without the middle intermission that slowed down the movie's momentum.",Null,0,0,7 June 2016
