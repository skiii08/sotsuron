United 93," An Important Film To See
","About a month ago I saw Tom Hanks on Inside The Actor's Studio and he said that this was the most film to see and he was right. I saw the film last night with my mother and neither one of us were prepared for what were about to see. I have seen documentaries about 9/11 and the people on Flight 93 and I have read the 9/11 Commission report. But this film takes inside of what happened on United flight 93 on that day that no one will ever forget. The film opens with the hijackers praying and meditating before they leave their hotel room and head for the airport. We see a regular and beautiful morning in which everyone is going to work: the pilots, the stewardess', the people in FAA and in Air Traffic control. We see the passengers including the hijackers wait before boarding the plane. It was a regular and beautiful day until American Airline flight 11 disappears from the radars and on the news we see the horrific images of the World Trade Centers on fire. Within minutes of that morning more attacks took place: the second tower of the WTC, the Pentagon, and then the airplane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania that was suppose to have targeted Capital building or the White House. While the passengers are on the plane and in the air everything is pleasant like most flights usually are: breakfast is being served, conversations, and friendly and courteous smiles exchanged. Everyone on the flight is oblivious of the news of the attacks on the ground and then the hijackers unleash terror 70,000 feet above the ground. Gradually, the passengers slowly realized that these hijackers were on a suicide mission and the news of the attacks are reached to them via telephone from their loved ones. No one in Air Traffic Control or in military sectors knew until after the plane had crashed that United Flight 93 was hijacked. My mother and I saw the film and we both left the theatre shaking and in tears. I have seen films that have made me cry and have impacted me, but there are no words to describe the feeling of fear and yet there was a sense of admiration for the passengers as they banded together and took the risk of taking control of the plane. The final moment is so powerful it leaves you shaking and begging them to win. The phone calls made from the passengers to their loved ones and the prayers of both the passengers and the hijackers resonate louder than the airplane engines. There is no one today who could even be prepared to experience on the events that took place on United 93. There are political statements or even any mentioning of partisanship. You don't even hate the hijackers, or at least I didn't. Quite the contrary. They were human beings driven by fanaticism and madness to commit the acts they were trained to believe were honorable to the name of Islam. The one hijacker, Ziad Jarrah, who was trained to fly the plane seemed to be the only one who was willing to back out, but didn't. This was certainly not film made to bring in box office winnings or title. This was a film that commemorates the heroes and the lives taken on September 11, 2001. Warning: the film is very graphic and no one will ever be prepared for a film of this magnitude.",10,4,8,21 June 2006
As Good as It Gets," Why?
","I will never truly understand how this film got all the way to the Oscars nor why it receives praises. The movie has its moments of sentimentality but they are few. For the most part, this movie is pretty much a misfire. Jack Nicholson plays novelist Melvin Udall, a misanthropic obsessive compulsive with a lot of venom. He has lunch at a Manhattan restaurant every day and insists on the same waitress to serve him. The waitress is Carol (Helen Hunt), a struggling single mother with a sick child at home and most likely the only one who knows how to handle Melvin. Suddenly, Melvin's world is turned upside down when he is tasked with caring for his gay artist next door neighbor's dog. The neighbor is Simon played by Greg Kinnear who is recovering from a violent burglary and then faces financial troubles after a failed art show. Okay I will cut to the chase and just say that the film suddenly turns into a road movie that leads to self awakening and blah blah blah. What's wrong with the movie? Fourteen years later I saw it again to see if maybe there was something I missed but no its still flawed and clichés. I still dislike this movie. It tries to be a comedy but every one liner from Jack Nicholson is a misfire. It tries to be sentimental but it is not sincere enough to pull it off. It tries to be romantic but there is absolutely no chemistry between Nicholson and Hunt. Jack Nicholson, well, he's Jack. This performance is not groundbreaking and its a role that he has played before under James L. Brooks: obnoxious bachelor with a heart of goldsomewhere. Helen Hunt is lovely and sometimes sympathetic but this is not a performance that was worthy of an Oscar (I am laying it out that Judy Dench was robbed of the Best Actress Oscar for 'Mrs. Brown' and even Ms. Hunt would admit it). Greg Kinnear is actually the only character I prefer to have seen more. He gave a performance that was the complete opposite of his usual style. The film is unbelievable, forced, and underwritten. The characters are two-dimensional and the plot is mostly sitcom material that disguises itself as a drama. Also, who the hell would fall in love with someone like Melvin Udall?!?!",5,1,3,18 October 2014
Match Point," Woody Allen's Greatest Film
","I just saw the film tonight and I cannot begin to tell you that it is Woody Allen's best work in a long time! I was so amazed that I couldn't even stand up after the film was finished. The film tells the story of Chris Harris (the always stunning Jonathan Rhys-Myers) an Irish pro-tennis instructor who meets the wealthy Tom Hewett. Chris and Tom become friends and then Chris is introduced to Tom's lovely sister, Chloe (a wonderful performance by Emily Mortimer). Chloe falls in love with Chris and he is content with her, but not in love with her. Chris is later introduced to Tom's fiancée, Nola (the equally striking and alluring Scarlett Johanson). Chris and Nola are immediately attracted to one another and from there the film goes down the road of obsession, passion, violence, and guilt. Chris and Nola are two souls who meet in the modern upper class world: they are sexy, smart, and ambitious, but unfortunately these are two souls that are so much alike that the result of their chemistry is one that ends in tragedy. One of the year's best films at least in my list.",9,0,0,10 February 2006
The Prestige," Thrilling, brilliant, and intelligent
",Christopher Nolan is a magician...a magician of cinema: he gives you the setup and then he surprises you with more than one great illusion one right after the other. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) are aspiring magicians and friendly rivals until Rupert's wife (Piper Perabo) dies in a freak accident during a magic act. Both men ensue in a deadly and manipulative competition on who is the great illusionist. Angier want obsesses about figuring out a trick Borden has mastered and sets out to beat him in that competition. 'The Prestige' is a intelligently written and intense story with a surprising sci-fi kick that will you talking. Excellent performance from the cast especially by the two leads Christian Bale (who is my soul mate and true love) and Hugh Jackman that both deserve Oscar nominations for their performances. Scarlet Johanssen is lovely and sexy as the woman they both love and she is the woman who moves in between them and sees them both for who they really are behind the tricks and illusions. I highly recommend this film and I bow before Christopher Nolan as a director who really knows how to make a thriller. Note: please do not confuse this film with 'The Illusionist' whereas 'The Illusionist' is a love story 'The Prestige' is a true psychological thriller and character study.,10,3,8,22 October 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," The Missing Answer To 'Lady In The Water'...an adult fantasy told through the eyes of a child
","Guillermo Del Torro once again tells a story set during 1940s Spain during the dictatorship of Franco. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother move into their new home with her stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). Ofelia also meets and befriends Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), the housekeeper whose brother is fighting in the Spanish resistance. Ofelia discovers a labyrinth in the garden of the house where Faun (Doug Jones), keeper of the labyrinth, tells her that she is the long lost princess of the underworld and she must complete three tasks before the full moon in order for her to take her place in the underworld. Meanwhile, Mercedes smuggles food, letters, and supplies to her brother's resistance army under the nose of the psychotic Captain Vidal. Once again an adult story told and seen through the eyes of a child. Like 'The Devil's Backbone' the child's innocence is what protects them from the horrible world of war and political suppression. This film is so visually stunning and the story really takes you in and never lets go. Ivana Baquero is a star in the making! Lovely and innocent as Ofelia she carries the film so bravely and with the genteel of a young lady. Maribel Verdu is also lovely and wonderful as the woman whose own journey mirrors to that of the little Ofelia. Sergi Lopez is absolutely the villain that you do not love to hate...he plays his character with the sinister and sadistic manner that is similar to that of Ralph Fienne's Amon Goethe in Schindler's List. This film is without question a top ten film to see in time for Oscar season.",10,4,11,21 January 2007
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good Old Fashion Fun
","I saw this film one evening with my son (who is seven and currently obsessed with all things WWII) and I was hesitant. But to my surprise 'Captain America' turned out to be a solid and well made film. Honestly, I am not a Captain America fan and I was under the presumption that the film was going to flop. But the film is fun, well-written, and delightfully three dimensional fun that is reminiscent of old matinée action films but with a deeply felt message. Chris Evans is engaging and well-cast as Steve Rogers a/k/a Captain America, a plucky scrawny kid from Brooklyn trying to join the Army until he is selected for a top secret experiment where he genetically transformed into a superhero. Armed with a cast of strong supporting actors Stanley Tucci as the brilliant and wise scientist, Tommy Lee Jones playing his usual tough guy as he can only play it, Hugo Weaving as the bad guy, and Hayley Atwell as the lovely and brave love interest (yes, I love a good comic book movie where women are not objectified damsels in distress!).",7,0,1,22 May 2012
Watchmen," Fascinating graphic novel. movie droning and too long, but more Rorschach
","I am a fan of graphic novels and some of the films inspired after them. I loved Sin City, 300, and yes, I enjoyed The Spirit. I never have high expectations for films but I left the film slightly disappointed. Based the graphic novel and made the filmmakers of Sin City and 300, 'Watchmen' is the anti-hero comic book/graphic novel film. I don't mind lengthy films but I do mind lengthy films that drone! 'Watchmen' is visually striking and action sequences are graphic but exciting however the film had too many subplots and kept jumping back and forth between stories within the main story itself which is suppose to be about solving the murder of a superhero, Edward aka The Comedian Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and the reemergence of the heroes called the Watchmen. Narrating the story (or stories) is Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) and he attempts to reunite the other Watchmen: Nightowl (Patrick Wilson), Silk Spectre (Malin Ackerman), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), and the main hero, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Cruddup). The only saving grace this film has are the performances by Jackie Earle Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Haley as the deep-throated and enigmatic Rorschach is absolutely remarkable and exciting. He became the only character in the whole film that I actually cared about. About two hours into the film I begged for the film to reach a conclusion. I think after Watchmen I will lay off the comic book inspired films until a third Batman movie comes out. This one really will wear you out and not even the stunning visuals will help except for the performance of Jackie Earle Haley. I would definitely love it if the filmmakers made a film about Rorschach only.",5,2,5,7 March 2009
Cold Mountain," Gone With The Wind, eat your heart out!
","Anthony Minghella is a genius! He loves to do these complex love stories when love is at its deepest, when passion is at its greatest, and when heartbreak is at its most touching. Ada Monroe (the great beauty Nicole Kidman) is a shy Southern belle and the daughter of the local minister in the small town of Cold Mountain, North Carolina. At the beginning of the Civil War, she meets the equally shy and deep Inman (striking performance by the handsome and great Jude Law) and they fall in love. But it's not like what we would expect: Southern belle playing hard to get or the usual Civil War soap opera. Inman and Ada are so in love its crushing and their love is expressed through their looks, the awkward moments, and the passionate first kiss they share before he marches on to the war. The film dances between the past and the present, between the war fronts and the home front. We see through historical accuracy the horrors of war and the toll it takes on humanity and of society. We see the Yankees raping and pillaging the women left behind by their Confederate husbands. And we see the harsh struggles that those on the home front must endure. While Inman lays injured he begins to see the reality of war and its illusion. He is the classic hero defined by Joseph Campbell: on a journey where he is tested by lust, vengeance, and faith. He endures starvation, pain, and harsh weather. He is a deserter and a target for death by treason. But his only hope and his only reason is love. Love in all its purity and in all of its crushing power to be with the woman he loves: Ada. Meanwhile, Ada herself waits for Inman and waits with agony and worry that he may never return to her or may never have loved her. She struggles with poverty, the possibility of losing her home to thieving opportunists like Col. Teague (great performance by Ray Winstone), and borderline poverty. And then Ruby Thewes, (Oscar-winning performance by Renee Zellwegger) a tough, no-nonsense, and strong young woman who befriends Ada and together the two women learn from each other. Ruby teaches Ada how to farm and keep busy while Ada teaches Ruby about culture and love. Together they are like sisters fighting off the crows and the weather. Anthony Minghella uses the formula used in another complex love story called 'The English Patient.' He is not a filmmaker who will go for the girl meets boy and they live happily ever after soap opera or teen slick. He is fascinated by love stories where words are said at the last moment and when love is at its greatest in times of war. There are so many moments in the film, but my favorites: Inman and the old woman (Eileen Atkins) who nurses him back to health and sends him his journey. Inman and the young Confederate widow (a brief, but touching performance by Natalie Portman). He needs shelter and she is alone with her baby. The scene where she asks him to sleep next to her is so poignant and touching. She is lonely and in mourning of her lost love; He is in search of the woman he left behind. It was scene not to be in any sexual matter, but it was scene of comfort and of true humanity at its finest. But like any other war movie there are also moments of horror: 'Patrols' on the home fronts torturing and killing their own people in search of deserters. Union soldiers terrorizing widows and families of the Confederate army (Natalie Portman has an agonizing scene when three Union soldiers force her to watch her sick baby being exposed to the cold in order for them to get food and to eventually rape her) 'Cold Mountain' is a beautiful film because it shows both the beautiful and the ugly sides of the human race. The film is also a show of love at its greatest.",Null,1,2,24 September 2004
Batman Begins," Batman is Born
","When I heard that my favorite actor and great love of my life Christian Bale was going to play the part of Batman and that Christopher Nolan was directing I went to the moon! By far the greatest Batman adaptation in films to date! Intelligently written by David S. Goyer (he is credited for writing Blade) tells the full origins of Batman: from the traumatized little boy that witnessed the violent murder of his parents to the bitter vigilante to the myth hero we all love. Bruce Wayne (Bale) is trained by Ras-Al Ghul (Liam Neeson) in Nepal. He returns to the corrupt and crime filled Gotham City with his training and philosophy with the help of his trusted butler Alfred (perfectly casted Michael Caine), soon to become Commissioner Gordon (the great Gary Oldman), and Lucius Fox (wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman) who provides Bruce with the gadgets including the ultimate badass Batmobile (a cross between a tank and a lamborghini)! Bruce/Batman is also reunited with his childhood friend and prosecutor Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes...hmmm, no comment...yet). Bruce is battling Gotham crime boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson who is always reliable and surprising as an Italian mob boss) and Dr. Jonathan Crane aka The Scarecrow (the sexy and chillingly good Cillian Murphy). This is my favorite movie and it is without question going to make even more and may even be better when the sequel comes out. The only reason why I gave Batman Begins a 9 out of 10 is because of the casting of Katie Holmes. She is a lovely actress and she has turned up some good performances in past films, but unfortunately she played the character weakly and flatly...no real depth or even real perception as the character was meant to be. She comes out too phony and plays certain scenes out of cue. She was terribly miscast and the only flaw in the film. Other than that it is an intelligent entertaining thriller and it pays homage to the comic book hero. Christian Bale is perfect in the role of Batman: brooding, tragic, intelligent, and may I also say hot as hell! He is without question to me the thinking woman's sex symbol and a greatly underrated great actor. Once he again, Christian Bale proves that talent outweighs star power.",9,1,1,10 May 2006
Twilight," Good actors...decent casting...but the screenwriter and director should have been fired!
","I recently became a fan of the Twilight series and a fan of Stephanie Meyers books. What I loved about the books was how the characters were beautifully developed and how they were intricate to the stories. For those who have never read the books or are familiar with the story, Twilight tells the story of Isabella 'Bella' Swann, a seventeen year old girl who moves from the sunny state of Arizona to the drearily depressing small town in Washington to live with her police sheriff father. Bella is the new girl in the small high school and attracts attention. She is awkward, shy, and lonely but she manages to make 'friends' and gets along with her classmates and attracts some of the boys. Enter the Cullen family. They are pale, they keep to themselves, they are wealthy, and beautiful beyond words.Bella becomes drawn to the Cullens. Specifically, she is drawn towards the 'youngest' son Edward. He is handsome, brilliant, strange, but socially withdrawn. In addition, like his 'family' he is also pale and never appears under direct sunlight.Bella later discovers the family secret and his hidden talent: Edward and his family are vampires who have lived for centuries by feeding off the blood of animals and controlling their thirst for human blood. In addition, Edward has the gift of telepathy however he can't read Bella's thoughts.Bella and Edward start off bitterly and distant, but become attracted to each other and fall in love.Everything is alright until a group of nomadic killer vampires enter town threatening the humans and soon Bella's own life.The books are amazing. I would also like to point out that I am twenty seven years old and have read my share of teen novels in the past. But Twilight is one level above the typical teenage novels filled with melodrama and angst. Twilight allows readers to connect with the characters and their lives. The Cullens I found to be a very fascinating family of characters because of their loyalty to each other and that they are not this cult. The characters are more developed. In addition, Bella Swan is the girl that many young women such as myself identify with.The casting of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart in the leads was well done. Both actors brought these two characters from the series to life despite of the material that was provided to them. The rest of the cast was also decent and nicely done, but the adaptation of the novel to screen by Melissa Rosenberg was a complete and total shame. For one of the writers and producers of a masterfully successful show 'Dexter' it is a disappointment but when it comes to romance she went back to 'Step It Up' a film of many clichés. Melissa Rosenberg and Catherine Hardwicke had many opportunities from the novel to avoid the clichés of cheesy teen romance films, but they missed and caved into the studio pressures of making this film as far away from the books style.The film was rushed, boringly cliché, and heartbreakingly disappointing.The cast led by Pattinson and Stewart did their jobs by bringing these characters to life, but the director Catherine Hardwicke and writer Melissa Rosenberg failed to theirs by giving Twilight series and its characters there full purpose.I cringe at the idea of them teaming up again to make any more.",4,3,7,23 November 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Quirky and Heartbreaking Love Story
","There are so many films that have had talked about relationships. But it is a rare treat and rarity to see a film that goes into the heart of love and relationships. I saw this movie after almost a year since my relationship with my b/f (and the father of our son) have broken up. I found myself crying and even wishing that there was such a technology that can remove all memories of him and of our relationship. But then I started to remember the really good times he and I had shared and most importantly the child that he had created together. 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' tells the story of Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey in his best performance and I hope he receives an Oscar nomination for best actor) who finds out that his ex-girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), has had all memories of their relationship erased by this medical procedure run by Lacuna, Inc. Out of bitterness and revenge, Joel also sets out to have her erased completely. But during the procedure, Joel has actually stepped into his brain and looks at his memories from a different of view. He begins to see the wonderful and happy memories that he and Clementine had shared and realizes that he does not want to lose them. While Joel's mind is being erased, Clementine has started a new relationship with Patrick (Elijah Wood), who was assisting in the erasing of her memories and tries to get her to forget. I loved this story and it made me feel sad. The bitterness and heartbreak of a love that is fading and the desire to be rid of such pain, but at the same time how strong a love can truly be. The whole point of the story is that while love is not only painful and hard, it is also something that redeems and is always forever. I hope that my ex sees this film and begins to realize the importance of what was once ours and that maybe one day we can learn from each other in order to move on with our lives.Jim Carrey is absolutely wonderful and Kate Winslet is lovely and funny and she has such wonderful scenes with Carrey. Winslet in this film has proven once again that she is a true leading lady and plays her character with vulnerability, quirkiness, zaniness, and a sweetness that makes her character so endearing and sympathetic. A wonderful film and beautiful screenplay by Charlie Kaufman who is the brains and genius behind 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation.' I loved this movie and it is one of the best of the year.",Null,0,1,5 October 2004
Saw," Jaw-dropping, bloody, shocking, great horror fun!
","OMG! This was a genius of a horror movie: bloody, shocking, and jaw-dropping...everything a horror movie is suppose to be about! Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannel, who is also the co-writer of the film) are two men who have never met before and both wake up chained on opposite ends of an abandoned bathroom with a corpse in the middle of the floor holding a gun and a tape recorder. Each find an envelope with a tape, but Dr. Gordon's envelope also comes with a bullet. They play their tapes and find themselves at the hands of a serial killer called the 'Jigsaw killer' who sets them up to play a game in which Lawrence is to kill Adam by six o'clock or his family will die. As the two men struggle to understand the situation they are in the serial killer is somewhere watching. What is so frightening about this film is that the serial killer doesn't technically kill his victims, but instead finds ways for his victims to kill themselves or each other. The situations are grisly and gruesome and emotionally raw. The Jigsaw killer targets victims who are not grateful for living or self-destructive in some way. Be prepared to watch this film and be even more prepared for the ending that is only seen in the most terrifying of all horror films.",8,1,3,16 October 2006
The Descent," The Best Horror Movie of 2006
","I am a huge horror movie fan and what I saw was without question the most original and hard core horror film I have seen in ages besides 'Saw', 'Hostel', and 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose.' Neill Marshall wrote and directed a film about six women on a cave diving expedition that descends into the bottom of hell hence the name of the movie 'The Descent.' The film opens with three of the women on a white water rafting trip in the wilderness and the vacation ends in tragedy when Sarah's (Shauna MacDonald) husband and daughter are killed in horrifying car accident leaving her traumatized. One year later, Sarah and her friends, Beth (Alex Reid) and Juno (Natalie Mendoza, who could be the next great female action star) travel to the Appalachian Mountains and embark on a cave diving expedition. They are joined by a three other women: mother and daughter, Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), Sam (MyAnna Buring), and punk adventurer Holly (Nora-Jane No one, see 'The Magdelene Sisters'). As they go further and further down the caverns, they end trapped and lost with company: cannibalistic monsters. They are a few wholes in the movie, but it is immediately forgotten due to the amount of violence and gore and jump out of your seats surprises. Neill Marshall is a genius by sending his audience down into a dark, claustrophobic maze of rock, bones, and blood. You will be without question left speechless by the way he circles around the characters as they desperately attempt to escape. If you are a horror movie buff this is the movie for you!",8,5,12,26 August 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Of Love and War
","I remembered watching Angelina Jolie on 'Inside the Actor's Studio' and she talked about the film 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith.' She made an interesting and really poignant view on what the film is really about: an analogy on marriage. 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' tells the story of John and Jane Smith, a seemingly normal, yuppie couple who live in the upper class suburbs. They have been married for five or six years and the first part of their romance was passionate and interesting, but as the years went on their marriage became routinely boring. They go to marriage counseling, but the void between them only grows more and more. But there is one little detail that neither one knows about each other (or at least not yet): they are both highly trained professional assassins. When they both discover that little detail they proceed to try to kill each other. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt co-star as John and Jane Smith. Both actors are incredibly great to look at, but they are incredible actors. They both have excellent and smooth comedic timing as they sometimes poke fun of themselves. They are both genuinely great together as on-screen lovers and I personally would like to see them in a sequel. Vince Vaughn who plays Pitt's friend and partner is funny and it is very obvious why Doug Lyman continues to work with him. Speaking of Doug Lyman, he is unquestionably a director who makes comedies funny in a dry way and action movies cool and slick. Smart, funny, sexy, and great action sequences that make it great for men, women, and couples.",8,1,3,3 December 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Luscious retelling of Bram Stoker's Novel
","There have been many versions of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but this film sticks to the format the made the novel. Dracula (a seductive Gary Oldman) arrives to England after holding captive real estate clerk Jonathan Harker (miscasted Keanu Reeves) in order to go after the Harker's beautiful fiancée, Mina, (a sexy Winona Ryder in 19th century costumes). While making his way to make Mina his bride, Dracula terrorizes those that stand in his way like Professor Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) and seducing Mina's friend Lucy (a pre-Jude Law, Sadie Frost). I loved the film production, the costume designs which earned the Oscar, and how Coppola stuck to the narration that made the novel famous.",7,0,1,9 February 2005
La Vie En Rose," Marion Cotillard is a TRIUMPH
","My God! I just saw the film an hour ago and I am just floored! What a beautifully realized biopic on the life of the greatest French singer of all time, Edith Piaf. The first time I had ever heard of her was when I was seventeen watching 'Saving Private Ryan' and being drawn to this voice. In 'La Mome' the film takes us back and forth between Edith Piaf's final days and her past: as a child she was abandoned by her drunk mother, her father later takes her only to be dumped in a brothel when she was five. It was in the brothel where she was raised by the prostitutes and paternal grandmother and she was exposed to song. She overcame illness that left her blind briefly as a child. Her father comes to claim her once again and drags her around the country as a circus performer and one day he pushes the little girl to sing and she captivates an audience. By the 1930s Edith Piaf sings for her supper on the streets, in nightclubs, and cabarets until she debuts in a music hall and she is a hit. Marion Cotillard is the winner! For those who do not remember she was the beautiful woman who played Russell Crowe's love interest in last year's lackluster 'A Good Year' but she is triumphant here in the role of a lifetime as Edith Piaf. She captures Edith's energy, faith, passion, and sorrow. I couldn't even recognize her. She is definitely up for an Oscar nomination for Best Actress! For years Edith was an alcoholic and a drug addict. She died young at the age of 47 from liver cancer. Her life paralled Billie Holiday and yet she survived Billie by three years. An amazing, powerful, and beautiful biopic of France's greatest voice of the century.",10,4,8,13 October 2007
Beowulf," Waste of Time
","I found it absolutely remarkable about the many critics who gave this film a four star. The movie had some potential but to be frank here are the following: 1. The movie is no where NEAR the epic poem of Beowulf 2. What is the point of animation? 3. Good actors put to wasteThe story is Beowulf and his men are summoned to protect a Nordic kingdom from a psychotic monster, Grendel. He makes goo goo eyes with the queen and she trembles at the sight of his bare chest and arms (she's not alone) and Grendel's mother comes for revenge in the form of the sexy Angelina Jolie. Trust me it's not worth it but Beowulf himself is a certified hottie for a computer animated character.",4,0,0,27 March 2008
Atonement," Deep and Dark Love Story
","Every once in a while or perhaps every year there comes your usual epic love story. What I loved about this one is that it doesn't play like an epic. Here is a story that is about making amends and a love that was so strong it became an individual's redemption. The film opens in London circa 1935: 13-year old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan, who can break your heart with those eyes) is a blossoming writer who one day misinterprets a series of events that occur between the affair of her older and determined sister, Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightely) and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy, a pure hearted leading man). But one night, Briony accuses Robbie of a horrible crime he did not commit and is condemned for. Five years later, the love between Cecilia and Robbie is as strong as ever and they correspond while he fights the second world war. Meanwhile, Briony grows older (Romola Garai, an true star in the making) and realizes the mistake she made, but can she make things right again? The film lapses between the points of view of the sisters and Robbie as they go through their own struggles between the war and the home front. This film is definitely worth seeing and on my top ten favorites of 2007.",9,1,4,28 December 2007
