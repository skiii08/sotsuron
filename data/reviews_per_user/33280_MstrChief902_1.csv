Scarface," Am I the only one that feels this way...
","I personally don't think Scarface is that good of a movie, and it doesn't deserve half the recognition it has received. The acting in this movie was mediocre and and at times borderline horrible. The main character Tony Montana (Al Pacino)in my opinion is one of most linear characters ever spawned in any movie.He has absolutely no personality and is extremely arrogant.Later in the movie he kills his best friend for falling in love with is sister, come on now. There was a good concept behind the movie but the over the top violence and acting just didn't cut it for me. The dialogue in this movie was utter rubbish sounding as if it came from a Arnold Swarcheneggar movie(i know i spelled that wrong). There was absolutely no realism in this movie and doesn't come close to movies in the genre such as good fellas and the GOdfather series. Those movies had superb acting, well thought out dialogue, and they actually immersed you in the life of the actors.",Null,6,11,29 November 2006
