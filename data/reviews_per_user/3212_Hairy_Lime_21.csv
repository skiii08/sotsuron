Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Gut-wrenching laughter
","It's hard to know how to describe or review Borat. I mean, how do you describe a movie that gets huge laughs from the Running of the Jew, or two hairy men wrestling naked? The movie has some of the hugest laughs I've ever experienced in the movie. At one point, I was literally bent over in my seat, pounding the chair in front of me with my fist (thankfully, a moderately attended morning showing and the seat was empty).The movie relies on pretty much every funny trick in the bag; physical humor, verbal humor (Borat's fractured language), sight gags (check out Azamat's fridge!), in-your-face rudeness, ethnic stereotypes used in a way to defeat the stereotypes (Even Borat is a spoof on how Americans view foreigners), a little politics (the rodeo), and even the jokes that you have to think about (watching the pentacostalists suddenly start speaking in tongues, and realizing that this is pretty much what Borat's been doing the entire movie). Almost all of it is fresh, audacious, and hilarious.Easy to decide if you want to see the movie, by the way. If it sounds like something you'd like, it delivers everything you'd expect. If it sounds like something you'd hate, it delivers everything you fear.",9,2,13,6 November 2006
Monty Python's Life of Brian," I'm Going to Hell, I Think
","<SPOILERS>It is my fervrent hope that God has a sense of humor: I would hate to think all of us who saw and roared at this film are bound for some inner circle of Dante's inferno.Like the Marx Brothers, the plot and the acting in a Monty Python movie are beside the point; what matters is the zinging of jokes and the presentation of sight gags.  When well done, as here, there is not a moment when you can think of something potentially funny that the movie does not do - with the exception of the animated alien sequence which sends a chunk of the film crashing to earth with the flying saucer.But the movie's laughs more than make up for that little lapse: the lone voice of dissent when Brian tells the masses that they are all individuals; the  crowd's wise conclusion that Brian's mother is a virgin, the crucifiction scene that manages to mock both Spartacus and every Christ story ever, the lisping Pilate, the People's Front of Judea - or is it the Judean People's Front....",9,0,3,19 March 2004
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Up, down, up, down....
","One of these days, I am going to figure out whether I love South Park or loathe it.  I suppose the moronic scatological juvenalia is the price you have to pay for the highs that the movie and show can reach.  Here, I found myself laughing more at the audacity and humor than frowning at, say, the running vomit gags.  Much more, in fact.",8,0,0,24 January 2004
Elizabeth," Great central performance
","Cate Blanchett is fantastic as the Queen, which is necessary for this film to work at all; a star vehicle for someone who was not, at the time, a star. The movie is fine, but has some annoying moments; a few too many of the old, 1960's vintage actor-shot-from-below-looking-into-the-distance-framed-by-a-cloudless-sky-backed-by-swelling-heroic-music for my taste, and the messages exchanged by a nod or a wink at several scenes in the movie seem out of place.But this movie will stand or fall on its central performance, and that central performance is great.  Also worthy of notice is Geoffrey Rush as the deep revolving Walsingham.",7,0,0,18 December 2003
L.A. Confidential," Excellent Modern Noir
","Well, I watched L.A. Confidential last night for the first time. An excellent example of modern film noir. A well written, brilliantly acted film. However, a couple of minor quibbles prevent me from giving this a 10, or calling it one of the great films of its time. First, I join in praising the acting; uniformly excellent. Usually, I don't care much for Russell Crowe, but here, why, it's almost like he was born to play an unintelligent mook prone to uncontrolled fits of violence. Second, I think it's Spacey's best work that I've seen, much better than his Oscar work in the vastly overrated Usual Suspects, for instance. And James Cromwell was superb. I'm only aware of seeing him in a handful of roles; he's been good in all of them, but his turn here was a revelation. The scene where he offs Spacey jarred me. Pearce, Straitharn, and even Basinger are also memorable.But I had a couple problems with the film, that at first blush at least keeps me from praising it too highly. First, I hated hated hated the times the director superimposed an earlier shot of a character over the screen, as if we were not smart enough to figure out that the dead girl was the prostitute with the nose job, for instance. A smart film like this one should trust the audience to get it. Second, you know, when a character asks another one, 'Would you shoot a suspect who is surrendering in the back to prevent some lawyer from getting him off?' and the character answers 'No', well, you pretty much know how the movie is going to end, don't you. There's a difference between foreshadowing and telegraphing. The movie does it a second time, too, when Spacey and Pearce are talking about how they got into police work and Pearce mentions the imaginary name he's given to the guy who killed his father, followed by a scene where Spacey whispers that name to Cromwell, followed by a scene where Cromwell asks Pearce - and only Pearce, mind you! - if he knew the guy. There is no reason for Cromwell to ask only Pearce about the guy, except to move the plot along to Pearce's recognizing that Cromwell is the villain. There were other, better, subtler ways to reach that conclusion, and the movie should have seized them. The 'rape' scene didn't work for me at all. Not for a minute. Again, it seems an obvious plot contrivance. I think it would have worked better (given that the point of the scene was to allow photos to be taken) if Basinger had been the aggressor. Oh, and I am somewhat torn between praising the excellent cinematography and arguing the movie should have been in Black & White. Color photography diminishes noir, and neo-noir. And last, how did Bud White survive that final shoot-out? Didn't Cromwell shoot him in the face, point blank? What, is this some sort of mystical Jules and Vince moment? Movie ends better with him dead, I think. But still, great acting and dialog. The screenplay is intelligent and suspenseful; wonderfully shot, great music. That I still rate the film as highly as I do, with these problems, is a testament to how superb the rest of the film is.",9,0,1,6 August 2006
Forrest Gump," Neither as good or as bad...
","People seem of two minds about this film: it either moves them to tears or to nausea.  But in reality, it is a well-made film with some strong performances but not more than that.  The core of this movie that is as simple minded as the title character; the facile speciousness of the movie's reactionary attacks on matters I agreed with made me realize just how shallow the movie's entire argument is.But beyond that, the movie is very well made; Hanks's performance could have been annoying in other hands but works well here.  Sinise was excellent as well.  Robin Wright's performance was adequate - I try not to blame her for the movie's implied argument that the social movements of the 60's and 70's were a working out of childhood neuroses - but never really stuck to me. The technical aspects of the film are outstanding, and the movie has a lot of laughs and tears despite its empty headed core.If it helps anyone, this is my wife's favorite movie.  But then, she fell asleep during Casablanca, so....",7,4,8,18 December 2003
Fargo," This Is Why We Go To Movies
","Spoilers To me the interesting thing about the movie is the introduction, about half way through the movie, of the Gunderson family. Until that point, the movie was a very well done thriller, reminding me strongly of the Coen Brothers' first film, Blood Simple, in the way it followed the long, obvious unraveling of a crime, every little mistake being far more obvious to the viewers than the characters. And then suddenly, the movie has a moral center to contrast the darkness of the plot.At first Margie seems to be almost a cartoon rather than a person, but what you realize over the course of the movie is that what she is is human: good at her job, loving to her husband, kind to her coworkers and subordinates, just... nice. And she wraps up the crime at the end with a great little speech emphasizing the human view, without us even realizing that it is that... For a little bit of money. And here you are. And it's a beautiful day. And, well, I just don't understand it. Now that you put it that way, neither do I.This is a movie that is almost uniformly excellent; the cast, headed by Macy, MacDormand and Buscemi, is perfect - I cannot think of any other actors who would be better for the lead roles. The script is spot on in the way it sees and develops its characters, and the way people actually talk. The Coen Brothers' taste for the quirky qua quirky is much more muted here, but it still adds just the right touch of the other to keep the movie riveting. And the cinematography catches the vast empty whiteness of the northern winter perfectly.Everything that brings me to movies is in here: great acting, great dialogs, surprises, amusement, shock, beauty, harshness, humanity.",10,1,1,30 October 2005
The Usual Suspects," Perhaps the most overrated movie of the 90's
","Oh, come on.  Yes, Spacey is excellent, and the rest of the cast does fine work.  But the whole movie is like a magic trick, and once the trick is explained, what is there left?  When I saw the movie the second time, I wasn't fooled by it, and I could see the machinery working - the wire we had been misdirected from, the card being palmed.  Is there any reason to watch this movie a third time?  I got annoyed with it half way through when it was on last, and have no desire to see it again.So, a well made little trick that I enjoyed when I saw it, but nothing classic.",6,4,6,20 January 2004
Lawrence of Arabia," The trick, William Potter, is not MINDING that it hurts.
","A British soldier – the titular Lawrence - and his Arab guide Tafas have stopped at a desert well to drink. Through a mirage and the shimmering heat, we see a black speck in the distance. 'Turks?' Lawrence wonders. Slowly, with minimal cutting, the speck resolves itself into a man on a horse who rides up, lowers his weapon and shoots dead the Arab. It is a beautiful, shocking and violent entrance and given the time it takes, a surprisingly economical one. We meet the second main character and juxtapose his character with Lawrence's. We see the stupid and brutal nature of the inter-Arab feuds and squabbles – which sets up much of what happens later – and the stupid and brutal nature of life in the desert – a desert which might be as important a character as Lawrence.But as the movie plays out, it also plays off what that scene reveals. We already have some inkling that lurking under the civilized veneer Lawrence wears something darker is lurking. We know he is something of a professional risk taker – we've seen his demise, for instance, and the way his immediate reaction to learning how to drive a camel is to put spurs to it. But there is a masochistic streak running beneath it that may explain Lawrence's actions better: his trick with putting out a match with his fingers, despite the pain. It is significant that when he gets what he wants, an assignment in the desert that he thinks will be 'fun' ('It is recognized that you have a funny sense of fun.') he blows out the match rather than snuff it with his fingers – the jump cut to the desert is not only beautiful and beautifully done, it indicates that the desert fulfills the need for pain that the lit match had poorly filled. After Lawrence leads a spectacular raid on Aqaba, he reports, 'We killed some, too many really. I'll manage it better next time.' But he also reports having to execute a man: 'There was something about it I didn't like. I enjoyed it.' In the end, Lawrence and Ali have changed places: it is Lawrence who leads and participates in the bloody massacre of Turkish troops at Tafas – now where in this review have we seen that name before? - and Ali who resists violence. But then, Prince Feisal had already previsioned what would happen with Lawrence. He tells the reporter Jackson Bentley, 'With Major Lawrence, mercy is a passion. With me, it is merely good manners. You may judge which motive is the more reliable.' And Lawrence learns that the internal squabbles of the Arabs are not the greatest problem he faces. Prince Feisal had already indicated this: 'The English have a great hunger for desolate places. I fear they hunger for Arabia.' Lawrence has been aware all along that his superiors have designs on Arabia (the historical Lawrence, by the way, had known of the agreement between England and France all along, but in the movie he learns of it only after Tafas, when the push for Damascus is planned.) and his work for the Arabs is designed to make them an English client state. Lawrence has been working all along for two goals, an independent Arabia and an Arabian client state.But then, this just scratches the surface of what is going on with Lawrence's character. We see so much more: the shameless exhibitionism, the intelligence, the possible sexual orientation – one wonders if his reaction to being raped in Deraa is similar to his explanation for the match trick – his belief in his own indestructibility, his conflicted loyalties and his love for Arabia, whatever the questionable source for that love might be. The movie needs a great performance in the central role, and boy do we get that. Peter O'Toole was a little-known Irish actor, primarily on stage, before this role. He is, if a strictly hetero man may say it, magnetically gorgeous and as perhaps our mostly naturally flamboyant actor he is a natural for the part of 'A poet, a scholar, and a mighty warrior (and) also the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.' He gets the conflicts inside Lawrence and wisely never resolves them. O'Toole's performance here is perhaps the single most unfairly overlooked lead performance in AMPAS history. This man being competitive Oscarless is a crime.The movie also has perhaps the best color cinematography ever – Freddie Young gets the credit for that – and a magnificent score, from Maurice Jarre. Along side O'Toole's great performance are superb performances by Sheriff as Ali – smoldering sexuality in the love interest – the always welcome Jack Hawkins and Claude Raines as Lawrence's British handlers, Anthony Quinn as an Arab leader of questionable loyalties and clear motivation, and Jose Ferrer in a brilliant brief turn as a Turkish Bey. The only performance that too me seems off key is Alec Guinness as Feisal. Not that Guinness is not a great actor, but perhaps because for me Guinness is the most British of British actors, even when made up as an Arab or a Tantooean hermit he seems like, well, a Brit made up like an Arab or a Tantooean hermit.It is not a perfect movie. Lean's direction is overall fantastic – no one handled epics like Lean. The battle sequences are beautiful, there are images (O'Toole in flowing white robes atop a train, for instance) that are perfect and iconic. But like all epics, including Lean's, there are stretches where the pace seems to lag unnecessarily and the movie drags. The ride across the Nefud should not feel like it is in real time, no matter how gorgeously filmed. But that's a quibble. This is a great film.",10,4,7,9 January 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Weakest Link - a spoiler or two
","Really, The Two Towers is the weakest of the three novels, and it is only natural that the middle volume would be a bit of a let down.  Jackson does a nice job of trying to lift the story - the battle sequence is fantastic - but to my mind the 10 I might have given for this movie went over the cliff with Aragorn.  I have nothing against Jackson deviating from the books - I was not troubled by the changes in the Faramir character, for instance, and adding the Warg riders themselves was a nice touch.  But what was the purpose of sending Aragorn over the cliff?  Creating false tension that probably fooled less than 1% of the audience?  Screen time for Liv Tyler? All it did for me was make the movie feel false for about ten minutes.  This crucial mistake is compunded now that we have the Extended Edition and see some of the scenes that were left out of the theatrical release.  the movie would have been stronger without Aragorn's fall, and with, for instance, the scene between Boromir and Faramir, or the march of the trees to the Battle of Helms Deep.Well, so be it.  One or two major missteps in a ten hour movie is not unexpected.  On its merits, apart from that, this movie, like the whole trilogy, is a magnificent achievement.One question: every time I look, Legolas is shooting dozens of arrows.  And every time I look, his quiver is full.  Where are the arrows coming from? Elf magic?",8,9,14,9 February 2004
Schindler's List," Spielberg's Best
","This movies is one of the most emotionally shattering and ultimately uplifting movies ever made. Ther story of one man who begins the movie eager to make a profit from the slave labor of the Jews, and ends it by sacrificing everything to save them. Neeson's central performance is solid, if unspectacular - he is overshadowed by Fiennes, who shows a frightening ability to capture unspectacular and always human face of evil - but his somewhat stolid performance may simply reflect a trait that allowed Schindler to dupe the Nazis. Kingsley, in the other central role, tends to slide into the background.The decision to shoot in black and white - as a confession, I love the look and texture of black and white - was perfect. Janusz Kaminski's black and white cinematography is a brilliant example of why B&W is superior to color in any film with an intimate feel or that deals with moral ambiguity. The trouble I have with the movie was - SPOILER - the two scenes at the end; one with Schindler breaking down when the Jews that he worked to save go free, and he weeps over the lives he could have saved with his car, or his ring, or his suit, and the pebble scene at the end. It felt like a return to the mawkish sentimentality of earlier Spielberg movies: a blatant attempt at jerking tears from me, which I resent all the more because it worked, I suppose.If Spielberg could have resisted the emotional hammer on this ine, it would have been a true classic.",9,9,13,22 January 2004
Rudy," OK
","Not a bad movie, by any means, and well acted by Astin, at least - everyone else tends to fade into the background.  My tolerance for noble, uplifting stories was tested by it, though.  But then, I think any movie that ends with SPOILER ALERT a Notre Dame victory END SPOILER ALERT has a tragic ending, so.....",6,3,15,9 February 2004
Annie Hall," A Benchmark
","Who hasn't stood in line in front of a foolishly pontificating ill-informed blow hard and wished for a large sock with manure in it?  Who hasn't fallen in love with someone only to wonder why that person would fall in love with the likes of you?  Who hasn't loved someone so much, just as they are, that you wanted to change them to make them perfect?  Who hasn't - as an analogy - treated the end of love like a coward treats a machine gun nest, rushing into the line of fire just to get it over with?Yes, this is Allen's best film, because it is Allen's most universal.  You do not have to be a New York Jewish intellectual undergoing psychoanalysis three times a day for this movie to resonate with you.  You simply need to do what we all do: love not wisely, but too well.  This movie is a benchmark for Allen; moving away from his earlier, 'funny' movies to his more serious stuff.  It hasn't always been a smooth transition, and many of his later movies ignore that what Allen does best is be funny - only Crimes and Misdemeanors, of his later films, works without being consistently funny. But here, as in Hannah and Her Sisters and Manhattan, Woody Allen mixes his seriousness of purpose and humor expertly.",10,9,17,26 November 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," All joy wants eternity
","There is a quote from Nietzsche's Zarathustra, something along the lines of, when you say yes to one joy, you say yes to all woe. There is a moment, half way through the erasure process for Joel, when he cries out to the doctor erasing his memory, 'Please let me keep this memory, just this one.' With that, Joel is essentially accepting the entire course and swoop of his love for Clemmentine; not just her confession that she feared being ugly, or her tangerine sweater, or even her crotch, but her changeability, her alcohol consumption; even the painful end of the affair, all for one memory. And at the end, despite his having forgotten everything about her, and despite knowing from her that the relationship is going to fail, Joel says yes one more time.This is a wonderful movie. I had resisted seeing it because of Jim Carrey; for the same reason I avoid Robin Williams in serious roles, when I see them acting drama, they always look like the improv is busting to get out. Here, though, Carrey never gives a hint that he is about to go all Ace Ventura on us. Instead, he gives a restrained, effective performance as Joel. Winslet as Clemmentine is likewise fine.But the real stars are the direction and the screenplay. The movie creates an unnerving feel throughout, especially in the memory sequences, with quick cutting and effectively unsteady camera work. The screenplay is intelligent and witty, and makes effective use of the non-linear story - we may be jumping around but we are never really lost.Well, except maybe once; the circular nature of the story - it begins more or less at the end - came as a nice surprise to me. But it is honest, the clues are there - the differences in the 'meet' story Joel tells, Elijah Woods's unexplained presence at Clemmentine's building, Joel's not knowing My Darling Clemmentine.... A nice job by the screenplay.By the way, on a couple occasions, characters sing My Darling Clemmentine. Note that both times, they stop just before the line, 'You are lost and gone forever/Dreadful sorry Clemmentine.' Not as long as we have memory she's not.One of the best films I have seen in years. It will live in my memory... I think.",10,1,3,21 August 2006
Titanic," Not all that bad....
","This seems to be one of the movies that people either loath or adore.  The first time I saw it, I marveled at the technical display but found the main plot curiously uninvolving.  This is despite a good performance by Kate Winslett and DiCaprio as well - he has been very good in roles before he became a superstar, and he will again.  As good as they were, I just did not believe in their story. But in fact, even though the romance between Jack and Rose feels false and anachronistic to me, I have come to appreciate, if nothing else, the importance of having that type of story to command our attention while the SPOILER ALERT boat sinks.  If you have the chance to watch Night to Remember, you'll see what I mean; the last half of that movie seems to be nothing more than men nobly rfusing to get on lifeboats and women weepingly not wanting to leave them.  Rose and Jack at least give us something to concentrate on while the thing is going down.So, give this a 4 of 5 primarily for the technical aspects, and also for answering the question, whatever happened to the guy who played Jesus in Godspell.  Answer: he's building boats even God cannot sink.",7,1,2,22 January 2004
Stalag 17," Wilder plus Holden equals Great Movie
","As I grow older, I find myself drawn more and more to Billy Wilder movies. I suppose it's the cynical, Central European sense of irony. Stalag 17 is not his best; it's not Some Like it Hot, or The Apartment, or Double Indemnity, or Sunset Boulevard; perhaps because he had no hand in writing it.Still, the Wilder world view is there, thanks to William Holden in the Central Role. He has a way of bringing the cynical attitude alive with just the way he stands or the way he smirks. He and Wilder were made for each other. And the movie is both funny (Those Nazis just ain't kosher? What kind of line is that?) and suspenseful.",10,2,4,11 February 2005
The Producers," A movie that rises below vulgarity
","This is one loud, obnoxious, vulgar movie. And oh yes, funny. Very, cynically, deeply misanthropically funny.So how do you critique a movie like this one? I guess you start by noting that the acting starts out over the top, and goes from there. And the script thinks that human weakness, greed, and lust are uproariously funny. Which, in the right hands, they are. And Mel Brooks's hands are the right ones.The movie makes great fun of pretty much everything - Broadway, Nazis, Old ladies, sex, gays, theater critics, Swedish models, Franz Kafka (not quite bad enough!), you name it, with gleeful abandon.",10,9,12,23 February 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Best of the three
","SPOILERS POSSIBLENow that the whole thing is before us, we can see what an incredible achievement the Lord of the Rings was. To have been able to maintain such a consistent level of excitement and interest throughout ten hours is a spectacular feat. They ought to give Jackson the last two Oscars retroactively.From the opening sequence involving Smeagol's first taking of the ring to the last of the four or five endings (no doubt making up for the fact that the first two movies really didn't have ANY) Jackson was in complete control - there was not a second where the story lagged or interest waned.I have often felt that I remember and love movies more for the scattered images that stay imprinted on my brain. This movie gave me several: First, the scene of Rohan's massed cavalry charge into the orcs. Cavalry charges must have been like this; the weight and feel of horses plowing through foot soldier has never been captured in movies like this. It took my breath away. Second, the set design of Minas Tirith was remarkable, all the way up to the jutting rock, like the prow of a ship. The first time we see the city emerging over the mountains takes the breath away. Third, Shelob was the best giant spider in the history of movies - o.k., perhaps the competition is a trifle weak, but still.... Fourth, Gollum remains the pinnacle of CGI art; his ultimate scene, wrestling madly with an invisible Frodo at the brink of the fire of Mount Doom, and the look of triumph on his face as he falls into the fire with the ring is perfect. I understand that Sarkis cannot get an Oscar for his performance, but it is perfect throughout. And the penultimate ending, when Frodo sailed away, actually nearly brought a tear to my eye despite the fact that I had read the books a couple times, and knew not only the end but the line he was going to deliver.Lord of the Rings usually does not draw mention of the acting, of course, but the acting here is good throughout. Ian MacKellan is a great actor; the last movie where he was not good... come to think of it, he's never not been good. Of the Hobbits, Sean Astin's performance was the strongest. The remainder of the actors inhabit their roles with skill.Quibbles? Sure, the dismissal of Sauruman with a perfunctory 'He's harmless' blew away what had been a prominent story arc of the first two movies. The absence of the scouring of the Shire was missed, but only a little; considering the prominence that Tolkein gave it, the movie played surprisingly well without it. I missed the Faramir/Eowyn romance, but only in the few seconds when they glanced at each other in the coronation scene.This entire arc of a story, from the retelling of the first great war against Sauron to the return of Sam to hearth and home, is one of the spectacular achievements of cinema. And three great movies, to boot.",9,0,0,19 December 2003
Gladiator," Well made and entertaining
","There is a place for a well made, entertaining film like this; as far as I am concerned just not, generally, on the Oscar podium, but still.Gladiator has some impressively filmed scenes; the extended battle scene at the beginning is first rate, as is the recreation of the battle of Carthage in the Colessium (Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't we win? - great line). All of the fighting scenes were imaginatively staged.The acting was decent. Russell Crowe - not one of my favorite actors - proves he can be effective when he's not given too much to say, and Juaquin Pheonix is superbly creepy throughout.But I found myself annoyed at stretches of the film, particularly at the end, where Crowe envisions meeting his wife and child on a tree line alley through a field of wheat, or something. It's what I expect from a Mitch Albom book, not a serious movie. Not that it detracts too much from the film, really. The story of Crowe's family is the peg to hang the action on; it adds neither intellectual or emotional depth to what is in reality a well-made, well-shot, entertaining popcorn muncher.",7,0,1,27 August 2006
The Wedding Singer," I would watch drew Barrymore in a bucket of urine - or a movie with Adam Sandler, for that matter

"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," One of the Coen Bros. Best. SPOILERS
","Sometimes, Coen Brothers movies can come off as overly mannered.  Sometimes, that ruins the film; other times, you get O Brother Where Art Thou?  This movie does not exist in any kind of reality; the characters talk, move and think in a way that has no connection with how humans talk, move and think. And yet, this movie works almost completely.Perhaps it's the strange mixture of mythic and human; perhaps it's the dialouge, perhaps its the way the Coen Brothers focus on absurdities of behavior and make them the key to the characters.  Or perhaps, the movie works because it is the funniest of the Coen Brothers movies.  The whole movie is shot in a sepia wash that makes the movie feel old; perhaps the style of the acting in the movie represents a time when the whole cinematic world was bitoned.  Or perhaps its that old-timey music.Whatever.  The plot of the movie loosely follows the Odyssey, with a few obvious nods to the Wizard of Oz thrown in - the KKK Klose Order Drill team was outrageous.  Clooney, Turturro and Nelson play three convicts escaping from a prison chain gang - and apparently the devil as well.  Along the way, they meet the cyclops, turn into toads, are seduced by sirens, become old-timey singing stars, are nearly hung, are nearly drowned, and eat roast gopher.  ('Gopher, Everett?' has become one of my favorite lines in recent movies; the way Nelson says it repeatedly, and the look of that poor gopher on a stick....).  In the end, they find a treasure, even if it is not the treasure they seek.As I mentioned, the performances are incredibly unnatural and mannered, so it is hard to judge them by regular standards.  Still, Clooney, Turturro and Nelson - especially Nelson - all pull off their characters admirably.  And as always with the Coens, the direction is interesting.  Not as good as Fargo and Blood Simple, but still quite fine.",9,0,1,6 April 2004
