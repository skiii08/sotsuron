Skyfall," Awful, misogynistic drivel
","Having just written a review of another film I hated (Imitation Game) I am now on something of a roll and thought I'd post a review of a film that is up there with Dark Knight Rises as a truly terrible film living off hype and bafflingly favourable reviews from critics.This film is drivel from start to finish. Many other reviewers have catalogued the endless plot flaws and I won't repeat most of them here but it is unforgivable to construct an entire movie around set pieces that have no logic. Why would a hacker so expert (and apparently gifted with precognition) arrange to be arrested, taken to an emergency location that he could not possibly have known about in advance in order to escape again pausing briefly to trigger an elaborate and pointless train crash en route (again that he has set up beforehand?) with perfect timing. It's just nonsense.Why does the film put in a ridiculous notion like a personalised gun that only Bond can fire for one tiny throw away piece where that fact saves his life.Worse still is the Aston Martin, which just takes us from drivel into the realms of the offensive. There is no place for the 1960s tooled-up Aston in this reboot. If it's from the 60s then Bond would be an old man by now. If it's from Casino Royale then it's Bond's personal property and it wouldn't have all the toys. It's not witty, it's just insulting.And possibly worst of all is the underlying misogyny throughout the film. Sam Mendes clearly hates women. Moneypenny does absolutely nothing wrong. She's pretty handy in the opening scenes and it's not her fault that she can't make an impossible shot. Why does she end up demoted to being a secretary (not even a desk job MI6 agent)? Bond's attitude to the other bond girl is deplorable (and unconvincing) and M ends up dead. It's bizarre.This is a truly, truly terrible film and I cannot understand why critics are giving it glowing reviews. Does Sam Mendes have pictures of them all naked? I have recently read that they are giving Sam Mendeds the next one to direct. I for one shall not be wasting my £10 going to see it. I'm done with Bond.",1,5,8,16 February 2015
Dunkirk," Dull, uninvolving and nonsensical in spite of one or two moments
","There are no spoilers in this review. We know how the whole thing ends or, if you don't, stop reading and get a history book. This film is not the way to learn anyway.I had high hopes of Dunkirk. People were saying it is a great film. I remain baffled as to why. I did not quite want to walk out of Dunkirk, but I was bored and I can't say I enjoyed it. It has too many fundamental failings. Here's why.Firstly (let's start with something positive), the good points.There is a bit of spectacular photography. Some of the shots of ships are well done.The acting - Having said that there's not a lot of 'acting' at all. Come to think of it there should be a lot more 'acting'. The characters should be more terrified, angry, resilient, defiant, chipper etc. None of this comes across but I think that's the director's fault, not the actors'.There are some interesting vignettes. They stand alone as well-executed scenes but, as I'll discuss later, they don't add up to much.Er, that's about it.Now, the things that just added up to make the film annoying, dull and uninvolving.Characterisation - I just wasn't invested in any of the characters. The 'lead' in the form of the soldier that we follow through the trials and tribulations of the evacuation is just not a sympathetic character. He is a chancer trying to get ahead of the queue. Quite apart from the fact that he's certainly not representative of the troops at Dunkirk, it's unnecessary; he's a weasely little character when there's a much bigger story going on. The rest of the characters are largely two-dimensional. The sub-plot on the boat, brings in another unsympathetic character, is difficult to believe in, is a distraction and has nothing to do with the evacuation. If we needed character sub-plots, we'd have been much better off looking at the people back home in England, their fears, motivations etc. and we'd understand the story of Dunkirk better.There is also no sense of the real fear, desperation, defiance etc that must have been foremost in the minds of the men on the beach. In fact there is very little emotion in the film at all. We follow a couple of soldiers about for a bit but we get no sense that men are awaiting the lottery of the next Luftwaffe bombing raid, losing their comrades or wondering if they will get home to their wives or whether a Panzer division is about to come over the horizon.Scale - there is absolutely NO sense of the scale of the evacuation. The actual evacuation involved some 400,000 men. We see very few... really, very few. We hear a man on a stretcher takes the space of seven standing men but the ships leaving the harbour are clearly not full; there are just a few guys standing by the railings. At Dunkirk, men were so crammed onto ships they had to leave their backpacks behind. Surely the budget could have run to a few more extras or a bit of CGI. We see three British aeroplanes and a couple of German ones! Story - there is no real story to invest in. Quite apart from the intensely annoying non-linear narrative, there is no sense of what actually happened at Dunkirk. We never get to understand why it happened, why the commanders did what they did or what choices they had, the RAF's role, the French army's role, how the fleet of little ships came about, why Hitler didn't attack by land or anything really.Non-linear narrative - oh my goodness me! Why? Don't get me wrong I enjoy a well-constructed non-linear narrative, but this isn't it. The story jumps around for no readily apparent reason. We see things twice but then there are two planes at one point so we're not quite sure if it's the first plane or the second one. It's a mess. Again, some interesting little vignettes but not adding up to any coherent story we can invest in.And then there are all the other little nit-picking bits that made the film annoying and distracting. A soldier salutes a very senior colonel without his hat on (not done!) and then casually imparts a load of information without once saying 'Sir'. Would a senior naval officer in 1940 really say 'we're stuffed'? Spitfires could fire their guns for a total of about 17 seconds and did not have apparently unlimited ammunition, nor could they keep flying with no engine. If a plane passes you at altitude (at what? 120-150mph?) and then ditches, it will not be 100 yards or so from your boat, it'll be well over a mile away. How is the boat captain an expert in German aerial tactics; his explanation makes no sense. When you're not invested in a film, you notice these things.Oh yes and other people have commented on the score. What score? It's just noise except for the final section is it supposed to be rousing or patriotic? It's just Elgar's Nimrod played at about 1/4 speed. Score by Hans Zimmer?.. not really.So all in all while this film does have one or two moments. It adds up to considerably less than the sum of its parts. I had started giving this three stars but the more I think about it, I don't think it's worth even that. Not only could it have been so much more, it's actually quite a badly made film. Why on earth are people giving it high ratings?",2,34,62,15 August 2017
The Imitation Game," Very very disappointing although the cast is excellent
","I am astonished at the rave reviews this film is getting and depressed  at how many people will now go through life with their impression of  Alan Turing and code breaking at Bletchley 'informed' by this film.  The plot is drivel. If you take this film at face value you will leave  believing that Turing was single-handedly responsible for just about  everything at Bletchley including the original idea for the Bombe  machine not to mention constructing it on his own in a barn,  recruitment of staff, the first breaking of any Enigma traffic, the  idea of using known words to crack messages, making strategic decisions  about whether or not to save trans-Atlantic convoys and countless other  things.  Most of the film is just nonsense. There is no way that Turing would  have been in a position to decide not to save the convoy (or even know  that there was one to save). He wasn't responsible for the idea of  using standard text in messages as ways into the Enigma settings (which  had been done since before the war). The construction of the Bombe  machines was a huge exercise involving a team of technicians and parts  supplied by external manufacturers, not Turing wiring it up alone in a  barn in his shirt-sleeves. It wasn't actually even his idea; the idea  of using a machine was brought to him by Dilly Knox from pre-war ideas  worked up by a Polish team. Nor could the machine spit out deciphered  messages after a couple of minutes. Turing wasn't in charge either, he  didn't come up with ideas of using crosswords to find recruits and he  wasn't alone in writing to Churchill; several of them signed the  letter. Oh yes, and there were several women code-breakers at  Bletchley.  The screenplay is also riddled with anachronisms, which just add to the  sense of 'Oh this is ridiculous' throughout the film. No way would a  well brought up young lady in the 1940s say 'Oh my God!' three times in  as many minutes. There are too many others to recall or mention.  Benedict Cumberbatch and the rest of the cast are excellent in their  roles with the material they are given (hence two stars rather than  one) but that cannot save what is ultimately a very disappointing film.  This is not a biopic of Turing, which is how it is presented, but a  nonsensical made up story tacked on to a heavy-handed political point  about homosexuality, which we all got without the banner at the end.  Two hours I won't get back.",2,288,457,12 December 2014
