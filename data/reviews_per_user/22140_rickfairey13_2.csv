The Benchwarmers," don't be too judgmental
","First things first, before going to see this movie, please take the time to remind yourself that it is a comedy and is not vying for an academy award! This movie is funny, and actually promotes a positive theme. The parts were well cast, the jokes were mostly fresh, and I laughed a lot, I think that was the point. Both John Heder and David Spade were great, and Rob Schneider played the likable lead. There was a quite a bit of physical humor, but Heder is good at that, and Spade still has a pretty sharp tongue. This is really one of the first fun movies of the summer. Go see this movie if you want to have a good time. Don't go see this movie if you are in the mood to be critical. Critical people don't laugh much.",9,8,18,8 April 2006
Batman Begins," Batman is REAL!!!
","Where is Gotham City? I only ask because this movie makes you feel as if you could actually go there, as if it actually exists somewhere. I liked Tim Burton's Batman, but Christopher Nolan's vision is so well paced and so real, that it is, in my humble opinion, the first REAL Batman movie. Christian Bale brings Batman to life with all of the emotion of a real person, I guess it takes a real actor to do so. The supporting cast is a group of actors with so much character that they could have had there own movies. Alfred is awesome. So many great movies stumble some during their running time, but this one did not miss a step. 10 out of 10. I wonder if Bruce Wayne would give me a loan?",10,8,11,23 July 2005
