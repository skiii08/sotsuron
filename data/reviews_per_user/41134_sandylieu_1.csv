Come and See," A Must See Touching Film
","Elem Klimov's Come and See is a tremendous Russian story about a boy battling WWII in Byleorussia. Towards the end of the movie, we will learn that the boy, Aleksei Kravchenko (Florya Gaishun) will evolve into a whole new person after he witnesses such tragic events. In one scene, he has to overcome a feeling of losing his whole entire family, which in many people's eyes is not an easy thing to do, obviously. There are many scenes, however, that may be horrifying to some viewers. During certain points of the movie, I would have to admit, I sat up on the edge of my seat, anticipating on what was going to happen next because I was in total shock. In the beginning of the film, we meet Olga Mironova (Glasha), who we see is a unique character. At one point, we learn that she is the woman who cries, and then laughs. But her doing so, brings the audience at ease because we get a sense of humor for just a few seconds.Within this film, one thing that I've learned is that they were looking beyond the camera. They use a wide-angle lens, which puts the camera right up to their faces. This effect makes you feel as if you are right in front of them, looking at every movement they are making. But that's the awesome part about Klimov's directing skills. This is a must see movie for viewers trying to understand what I am trying to convey, especially the cow scene.",Null,2,2,2 August 2009
