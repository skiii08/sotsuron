Mission: Impossible III," mi3
","I have seen all three of them. But they all had there flaws and they all had there disappointments. This one had all of that and not much more. It was entertaining and kept my wallet happy for two hours. I was happy about it. But I wish they would have spent more time on the villain little more than the love factor of the movie.But I loved the opening scene in the movie. I thought it keep Tom cruise's best acting ever in it. I really loved it. But the ending could have been better and more of the villain would have been lots better. I don't have a great amount of detail about this movie, all I can say it was good for one time or maybe 2 but nothing more than that. 8.3-10",8,2,3,15 May 2006
United 93," Flying into boredom
","I have to stay this movie was really boring. I thought it would beat out the last 9/11 movie. In my opinion this movie was not even close. When I walked into the movie and my friend and I were the only ones in there. We knew that could not be good. But we sat down anyways and watch the first 5 minutes of the movie. After that we all were just talking about other stuff. I have never done that in a movie. The first hour of the movie was nothing special at all. Just like shots of normal people doing normal stuff and it was really boring. When you started to get into the good part of the movie where planes where being hi-jacked it was totally a different movie. Once the first plane was hi-jacked we kept our eyes on the screen for a while but then it kept going in and out of action. The movie was OK. It was not what I thought it would be. It's more of a short educated movie, not what i thought it would be. On our way to the movie, we saw a poster that was promoting the two towers. That one is going to have lots of problems and controversy over. But over all this was a okay film but not thing to go crazy over. 6.4/10",6,1,4,17 May 2006
Silent Hill," Just Horrible
","We went to a late night movie Friday night, well actually it would have been sat. But I have played the game before and it's really sweet. So I thought the movie would match the hype of the game. Boy was I wrong. The movie started of to long, but was not that bad. But there were some really bad mistakes in the movie like seeing the camera guy in the helmet of the cop and the windows of the room where they did the green screen. The movie was just slow and antagonizing the heck out of me. I was getting upset about the movie. I was going to work it out but there was a line in the movie that just made me jump out of my seat and leave for a few minutes. The story was bases on a city that burned and killed all the people. Well the comment was ' Man, this room look like it was on fire' COMMON, No crap. Just horrible horrible things that just made the movie they way it was. I was giving the movie such a high score cause of the good camera work and the demons looked really well done. Besides that...this is the second worst film I have ever seen in my life, behind punch drunk love. So go take your money and go see inchworm's or just go get something to eat. Don't waste your time and patients on this film.",2,1,4,24 April 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," xm 3
","For the longest time I really did not think much about x-men, but in class last week all that we did was watch the first 2 movies and reflect on them before we went to go on a class field trip to go see x-3. We went opening day last Friday, Our whole class was there to watch it. It was really an amazing film. I liked the first one, but I loved the second one. Now that I have seen this one, I love all of them. I want the whole series now. I think the film was really well done and I think that they did a great job on keeping you involved the whole time.The only thing I did not get is why they make you think that there is going to be another one made? Cause the director and produces agreed not to continue this series any longer. Overall I think this movie was great. The graphics in this film was amazing. The acting was great. They used great camera angles to make the drama great! Well I really don't know what to say about this film right now, I might make another review later on this movie later. 9.6/10",9,0,0,30 May 2006
