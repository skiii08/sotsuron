Requiem for a Dream," Brilliant
","There is usually long between every movie that speaks straight from the gut and tells the truth so openly, so freely, so directly that it actually moves you.  Those directors who try often fail, as they spin their view reality into hollywoods overly glorified world, but where they have failed, 'Requiem for a Dream' succeeds.  The movie shares four different fates with its audience, dealing out the details bluntly, directly and vividly.  You can clearly see, perhaps even sense, the inner turmoil and the vicious mood swings that each character strives with. All four 'lead' actors deserve much praise for the way they bring their character to life, be it the loving mother, addicted to sugar and television, or be it the rebel girlfriend, breaking first with her parents and then with her morals.  It is all pieced together so perfectly, making this a truly spectacular film showing all that is rotten in a beautiful way.",10,0,0,25 May 2001
