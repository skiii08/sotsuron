Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 2 thumbs way up!
","I give this movie two thumbs way up, because it is the best movies I have ever seen. I loved the special effects in this movie, and I thought the roles were given to great actors. I have seen this movie five times, and I will continue seeing it once a week, until it comes out on video. I enjoyed Return of the Jedi the most out of the four, because it wrapped up the whole story, and all the pieces of this 6 episode sci-fi/adventure were finally complete. I think the role of Anakin Skywalker, could've been given to a little taller kid, then Jake Lloyd, after all he turns out to be 2 meters tall. The special effects were awesome, but I think they could've made SOME of the scenes realistic, most of it was blue screen.",Null,0,0,12 October 1999
