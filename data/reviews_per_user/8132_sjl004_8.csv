Mission: Impossible III," Good action picture PLUS I have been to Lake Wanaka!
","In the cinema I didn't like J.J. Abrams direction of the camera, it was shaky the whole time and you couldn't focus on the characters. Plot was OK, a little soppy with the love references but nice performances and stunt tasks and everyone laughed when Simon Pegg came on. Philip Seymour Hoffman was once again amazing acting in this film.The Sunset Blvd style beginning was good and I liked the ideas of superiority used in the film and the methods behind some of the stunts that the IMF team use. Tom is looking only to represent an older Ethan Hunt. Will be enjoyed by most as the action is fast paced and thrilling. I loved the fact the mask making bit was included, very clever! The is plenty to discuss after the film has finished regarding your theories!",6,7,13,4 May 2006
Se7en," 'There are 7 deadly sins' *spoilers
","(Part review) The 6th and 7th were talked about by John Doe but only a 6th death occurs? I was expecting more of a 'completion' with 7.Even the genius, Somerset said 'There have been 2 deaths, you can expect 5 more'.Mills was a good rookie character, seen better though, Somerset (and Morgans ace performance) worked well sleuthing at the library and with the pizza parlour/FBi guy, but I've also seen slightly better. Good cinematography but Saw is taking this to a better level, also for cinematography and suspense.Se7en was mysterious with the sins being committed and when they would expect the next, but it didn't completely gel.The film is shocking though.",7,0,1,25 September 2008
Van Helsing," Good characters, fun film
","Its over the top with some crazy fantasy put in to boot. Decent accent by Kate Beckinsale only, Hugh sounds a cross between Harrison Ford and Hugh Grant and his sidekick is a fleshed out C3PO.Stephen Sommers has had a memorable stab at the thirties classics, including the obvious and the Bride of Frankenstein, although the most detailed character is the monster, a little more wouldn't go amiss. The trouble with the film is the high octane action with no room to breathe, like Die Another Day. The character I was most looking forward to was the The Wolfman, whom has a confusing storyline that with the fighting against Van Helsing becomes the rest of the films main suspense. A sham, because the mood could have handled a rest, creating a nest errie surrounding. The ending is like a scene from King Kong, a similarity with the end of T2 and a bit of a Tarzan Lookalike in there as well. The musical score is not hitting the target particularly the horse carriage scene. Generally the plot strengthens during the film, but not to make is a great one to watch. Unfortunately the film adapted a pure action flick rather than a restrained thriller, which giving the potential atmosphere would have been a real bloodsucking treat.",5,0,1,16 June 2004
The Princess Bride," Throughly enjoyable storytelling.
","The premise of starting a film and continual flicking to the view of a granddad (Peter Falk) reading a book to his unwell grandson (Fred Savage) isn't new, yet the use of interrupting the story ads a new fresher feel to the mix.I myself watched this film with my Mother when I was (very rarely) off sick from school in 1991. Whilst watching the film and for the rest of the day after, I cannot once recall feeling ill. The score was soft, yet magically purposeful and during the most thrilling accepts of the film, notably the fight sequences (in particular involving Mandy as the Spaniard sword fighter) were really captivating. The vast array of different themes this picture evokes is also a great achievement and stirs up many emotions, leaving few unhappy with the final film. Ultimately its a romance, but its set in fantasy, makes it all the more unusual, but generally more enjoyable. There's a constant act of heroism and revenge, plus humour, wit and gripping thrills (when Westley is still a bit 'stiff' in places). Also mystery and intrigue, with the legendary pirate and the tense chase involving the pirate impressively chasing after them up a rope.Having just re-watched it, it looks as if it must have influenced Gladiator and Shrek. The line 'My father was .....' is similar to the Maximus speech in Gladiator and the use of daggers can also be reflected.The PG rating is a suitable choice, some craving more might think its missing more nastier material, yet the more adult references can be applied to the rating it has been given, allowing one and all to enjoy it.Finally, the fine choice of actors is great. With typical quick witted humour from Billy Crystal, the continuation of the British theme with Mel Smith and Peter Cook, the reuniting of Christopher Guest with Rob Reiner, a wrestling hero Andre the Giant, the always watchable Cary Elwes, Mandy Patenkin leading the frontier for his respected performance as a Spanish peasant who was recently in The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland (what a waste) and the villainous evil (inconceivable) Wallace Shawn who delivers the line: Vizzini: Ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates? Westley: Yes Vizzini: Morons.He says the line so quickly, its perfect, which rightly earns a place on the trailer.A few people in this film have interesting worked again with others from this film. Billy Crystal was in When Harry met Sally with the director Rob Reiner and also in This is Spinal Tap.",9,0,1,13 July 2004
Children of Men," Great action but VERY weak storyline
","Yes its realistic and yes there is great action ala Frankenheimer, yes great cinematography ala Kubrick and suspense and thrillers ala Hitchcock but the plot just seems a little lame and like A for Andromeda, a British film that was a little amateur and soppy.Little music (thought this would add to realism but I guess not).The acting wasn't bad, Peter Mullan and Chiwetel Ejiofor stood out for me and have always enjoyed their performances and welcomed Julianne Moore and Michael Caine as always. Clive Owen is in the film in every scene and his acting, despite his tone and wooden speech is a joy to watch. The fact that the one sentence plot is taken in this direction just seems a little tedious. I enjoyed it and the plot (computer game style scenario encountering numerous obstacles on the way) but I guess a subplot may have helped.",7,1,4,5 February 2007
Mulholland Drive," My opinion of the summary of events (SPOILERS)
","Betty for most of the film is very happy, cut-outs of Betty show her very happy, living life as a celebrity as she wanted to, although this 'life' maybe a tribute to her as she couldn't be/was in her dream. We then go to back to look at her life and how she came to die. Interestingly this last sentence summarises what happens in Sunset Blvd., Lynch hammered home this point by showing said names street sign. The multiple images of her, in the opening scene indicate the many personas she possesses. Any the picture with the grandparents shows which one she is with in this dream. The funky dance scene as the opening scene shows the magic involved when someone first dies, its a little hard to adjust, this also is shown by the blurry images in the film and the morphing acts demonstrated. The music video 'Let Forever Be' by the Chemical Brothers was made 12 months or so before Mulholland Dr. and is identical to the opening scene, its about a girl waking from a dream, to find multiple cardboard copies of herself (they come to life) and go-go dance, its trippy, like the film. The black faeces by the dog in the beginning represents the early transition by the arrival of 'Ruth' into Betty's dream, as the black represents acclimatisation to the new arrival. Just like heaven Ruth must pass through the gates at the start of the drive, these represent the pearly gates; it's a cleaner who she walks past (whom is there no expunge previous life experiences, which explains the amnesia). The car crash is at night and involves a black car; this black theme is continued here and with Cocos hair (almost can tell its dyed). The blue box is a portal like in Donnie Darko, flashes of recollection appear and that is symbolised by the key to the box and the way to another place. It is also a reminder to leave the dream, as we are not supposed to dream forever, its like holding your breath under water - your diaphragm twitches to try and make you surface (I got a degree in Bio). The granny can represent Betty as the star whose made it, the glasses whom by her husband represent Adam and their children include the guy in Winkies (think about the store name), the cop searching for is in-fact his sister and the hairy troll thing that looks like Adam. The amnesia is also telling Betty that she cannot see herself as someone else, so its OK to dream, it also means she comes to terms with seeing herself dead on the bed, she dies in her sleep, the gun that went off is a tribute to the end of Fight Club. The time of dying is symbolised by the relatives (maybe herself) as the old people can represent life, but being white, she shouldn't be afraid, however the presence of old age in a dream is showing death, or the oncoming of it, which is why such goes into a dreamlike coma before dying.The start of the dream is her being happy, as when you are dreaming you are happy, the almost over-acting my Naomi in the first act and smiley nature of 'arriving' in a dream is the first satisfaction of sleeping, as well as the first moment the endorphins are released. Later these hormones run out, she masturbates to try and return the pleasure. The blurry image whilst this is happening represents her mind trying to urge herself back into a happier dream, the blurry images are also in the morphing between world, the 'accidental' blurring of Ruth's character represents an aurora of pleasure, a zone/portal to another dream, a new 'life' (womb) and the realisation that Ruth is not real, as really people are not blurry, coming to terms with this, she might in fact be masturbating in her sleep, even though we see her on the couch. The different colour scheme illustrates this. In the bed Ruth was dominant, on the couch Betty was (she is on top) and the camera angle is different. The blurry image of her rubbing herself is a change of intensity in the dream and a cry out for more passion. She is trying to will herself to shift to another world or destination by the power of emotion. The 'Silenco' man is a replica of the Master of Ceremonies in Cabaret and he controls the whole show, the dream, recall he makes her shake in her chair and the constant reminder that she's in a dream, because the sounds were not real. Just as her visions were not real. The gangsters are now the hit man, consolidated into one image, the blond hit man. The espresso and the spilling of it, means the rich nature of the dream, and spitting it shows that it gets scary, almost like a nightmare. The use of Adams car as a convertible, means just that, he can change, he can become different sway views, he is influenced by the cowboy and to pick the girl. He sees Betty at the audition, neither have seen each other, Betty leaves, she is looking for a different dream then to win, although please discuss this point as well as the cop searching.The hairy troll is showing by the guy in Winkies however we are supposed to believe that their is the reality, yet we don't have them in our reality, this is a world/dream that one of Naomi's characters have been in, yet isn't currently, this imbalance is shown by the paranoid status of some of the citizens in this world, this world (like in Revolutions) is becoming unstable and Betty might not be able to return, this explains why the name badge changes, why the troll is no longer a tramp, he might have evolved, or being corrupted by the box (like LOTR), and the breakdown in equilibrium is transmitted to other world 9(Ruth gets a headache), she undresses (black), she's in the shower, to cleanse herself for the new world and holds her head (from headache) as all is not right in other worlds. She wears the blonde wig, because she is becoming Betty, like the gangsters becoming the hit man and the combination of other events to trigger the end of this life for Betty/Ruth. The dog of Coco, do we see it much? Its dark matter produced is littering this world, anyone see any other dogs, this lack shows that they are not normally present. The affair with 'Wash Gene' shows a change to the world that Adam is present in. He acknowledges it, realises he must then accept the girl (was it Naomi in the first image of the girl?) he is originally stubborn, but comes around, as its not his world, however in the dinner scene, it is a world where he was a greater power of influence in the hierarchy. The other avatars such as Adams wife, is another mention to trying to change, and also to stay with him. The neighbour of Betty is in actually Betty's real neighbour, but becomes the personality of Ruth to communication with her in the dream. * My post contains my opinion in a non-linear order, like the film * Scenes where there is little dialogue have other careful illustrations, and vice-versa (any film) [cheers]'this is it' 'chew some gum your breath smells like my grandmothers feet' THE CHASE[jump4]",7,1,3,10 June 2004
Inception," Like ideas, this is open to interpretation
","This is an existential film; the plot and the depth of the complex themes in the film are well explained (moving it away from a David Lynch-style film), the character development is focused on the protagonist and this is fine as there is plenty of depth and 'levels' to deal with. Despite preferring the Matrix (it draws reference to the Matrix in a brilliant executed hallway scene). This film also has a romance subplot as well as a clever use of dream levels which I felt was well done and relatively unique. Coupled with the incredible cinematography and acting I thought this was a polished picture with plenty of joys and interpretation.",8,2,7,26 August 2010
Donnie Darko," Mysterious, dark, tangable, multilinear film.
","The opening scene, straight away struck me to be intriguing.   The music is eerie, it's a local neighbourhood, yet it's desolate, except for one teenage and his bike next to him.  The use of this green grassy sub-urban area would normally represent happiness and security but for this character it shows desolation, my road in particular has neatly cut grass and due to speed bumps isn't that busy either.  Whilst sitting down it is almost as if he has sub-consciously creates this disaster and that he has created Frank to sort out the problem as well I found the use of the bicycle to symbolise deformation of this boy's psychology.  The fact that originally he is on terra-ferma  and is in a solid' place confirmed his sanity is there. However once on the bike that represents an imbalance, for when he stops, he was fall off or have to dismount. I myself cycle a great deal, particularly at that age and particularly down hills (because unlike walking, downhill is basically a free ride).  If Donnie was walking a greater stability can be perceived, however the use of the bike going down the hill shows a lack of control and an irregular velocity as he speeds up and slows down. Jake plays an adolescent and it is his expressions that capture Donnie's appearance and bewilderment surrounding the events that unfold around him.  Richard's use of a teenager going through puberty illustrated the kind of viewpoints and distorted images that a person of that age can experience; they have a lot of hormones in their body and a lot of pressure from many directions being placed on them, all of which can negatively effect the psychosis of that individual. This altered vision and paranoia that Donnie is experiencing has led to the creation of a wormhole; a paradox with many subsequent turnouts that greatly affect the story and the flow of the plot.  This is not a simple storyline from A to B, but once the jet engine is seen falling from the plane, we see that an extra tangent of this story has been created and this now has to be transposed into this once linear plot by the viewer.  Once the timer to `the end of the world' is announced, we the spectators sit back and relax, simply awaiting the tale to unravel it self with the gradual countdown to the end of the film.  Yet the time travel twist alters this experience and obviously involves the viewer more deeply; it adds a greater mystery element, as to what other surprises we should be expecting. The obscurity of the accidental' turbine also leaves the observer to consider how this came about, long after watching the film.  It instils a sense of doubt as to how could this event come about, yet being a paradox the scenario is impossible, but it's the underlining fantasy element in an otherwise drama and thriller that adds to the greatness in this film. This leads us to the character of Frank the rabbit.  Firstly it's a strange name for what would be classes as a pet, yet it's clear this is an independently wild strange creature.  It's a human name, if it was someone's pet a more suitable name for him would be Fluffy' however it is clear that he is anything but that.  The use of Frank as his name is appropriate because it is giving us the first hint that this is a human after all. Secondly, I saw frank as a scary character.  His alien looking being literally adds an extra dimension' to the storyline.  He is represented as a hard shiny metallic beast and I perceive the multi-reflecting surface of Frank illustrated the point that he had many personas, duties and represented numerous abilities (most obviously that it was just a costume with someone else inside).  I to am like a chameleon, occasionally wearing more creased clothes and responding differently to different people.Throughout the film Frank has had different personalities.  He has represented the hero and the key to knowing when the world will end, yet he brings with it death and anger, which is shown when he is confronted by Donnie in an automobile and Donnie realising he wanted a greater uninhibited independence.  Its interesting that this occurs at night where, despite being able to see superficially further at night, the real world is in darkness.  I had a rabbit called Rifkin; it was grey and died on my birthday.  I to can familiarise myself with the character of Donnie.I liked the symbolism used in the film, I have already mentioned some references but the use of sleep to show which individuals Donnie had touched was a lot of fun to work out where his influence had been centred.  This has had an affect on my particular sleep pattern and wonder if there's someone I have or haven't interacted with that day, and whether that's affected my natural order of things to get to sleep.The costumes used by April Ferry were really well inspired.  The use of grey for Donnie showed a dull, neutral repression.  It showed his generally lack of enthusiasm and absence of creativity.  From this I've taken some initiative to wearing the hooded bit more of my tops (like right now) and experimenting with different hood colours so you see the world blinkered but with a different hue or tone making up the edges of your peripheral view (greater for females, because they have a wider angle of vision).
I look a lot like Donnie, tall, slim, with short dark brown hair, this is probably the most obvious influence this has had on me, as for the use of the bicycle, I have got ridden of my car and now cycle to work.  I don't have a skeleton costume but I have been seen about in a homemade dolphin costume (pictures available).",8,0,1,26 July 2004
