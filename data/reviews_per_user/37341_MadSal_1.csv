The Blair Witch Project," It's an amazing experience in the woods!
","In order to add a greater sense of realism, I saw this movie at a drive-in in a rural area 30 minutes from Albany.  That setting gave the movie a greater impact than an enclosed theater ever could!  The fear I came to feel was wildly enhanced by the woods surrounding the screen upon which the movie was projected.  I know drive-ins are a dying breed, but if you have the chance, this is one movie that definitely must be seen at one!",Null,1,1,31 August 1999
