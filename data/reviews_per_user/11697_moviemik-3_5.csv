Blade Runner 2049," Good looking movie does not equal Good movie
","Like its predecessor, a short noir story was overblown to show off special effects. at east Ridley Scott kept the original to under two hours but this one? 2 hours 43 minutes???? holy crap.
tell a story - don't show a story.
And Harrison Ford has about 20 minutes of screen time, if that much
bad movie.",3,20,41,13 February 2018

Pearl Harbor," I like Michael Bay's style but this movie was not worth the hype
","I am going on the record early on just so you do not think I like everything Michael Bay has directed.  It was a very mensa-mensa movie.  About thirty minutes of the movie was really good (i.e. the attack).  But even here it failed to achieve the emotional intensity of the beginning of Saving Private Ryan.  The rest was a rip-off of the old movie (insert any name of any 1940s war movie--I pick Test Pilot).  In addition, the love story might've been interesting but was so poorly written that I did not even care about the characters, with the exception of Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Dan Aykroyd who were both on the screen way too little.  Michael Bay's place is with Action movies with humor--not heavy pieces like this, which would have been more reverentially directed by a director of higher caliber, Spielberg for example.",Null,0,0,25 May 2001
1941," Watch it
",Any movie that features the following....:1. The Geek from 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' torturing The Mayor from 'Jaws' 2. A bunch of Japanese soldiers disguised as walking Christmas Trees 3. A hilarious USO dance sequence that boils over into an inter-service street fight 4. the film debut of Mickey Rourke and the big film debut of John Candyand last but not least5. Tough guy Robert Stack crying and singing along to songs from the Disney classic 'Dumbo'.....CANNOT BE ALL BAD!!!!!,7,39,61,11 May 2001
Die Hard," Best Action Film Ever
","Die Hard is still the standard bearer for all action movies--the best action movie there is.  A true combination of action, suspense and humor, Die Hard is an achievement beyond what anyone in the production even dreamed about (I think)",10,1,3,21 November 2000
