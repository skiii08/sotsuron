Ford v Ferrari," Le Mans '66 Film Review - James Mangold Directs Ford v Ferrari With Matt Damon & Christian Bale - Not Just For Petrolheads
","James Mangold directs as Tracy Letts, playing rich dickhead Henry Ford II in Le Mans '66, (Ford v Ferrari), throws a spanner in the works, and tells his staff to come up with an answer to falling sales, or walk. And Jon Bernthal's Lee Iacocca puts his wheel nuts on the line, and tells Ford that no one aspires to buy a Ford. James Bond, (that degenerate), does not drive a Ford! Hell they all want Ferraris. Because they are thoroughbred sports cars winning the Le Mans 24 hour race. And Henry, thank god for Lee, actually thinks it's a good idea. So armed with a cheque book and pen, Lee flies to Italy to make Ferrari an offer. Maybe Remo Girone's Enzo played them, because he accepts another inflated Fiat offer. Not sure if it was already on the table, it would appear not. But with Ferrari in play Fiat took a swipe. And by the way Henry Ford is a fat pig Enzo tells Lee, as a parting shot. Who then repeats what he said to Henry. Rightly pissed Henry decides that Ford Motor Cars are going to build their own sports cars. And beat Ferrari at their own endurance race game.But how? Well with Matt Damon's Carroll Shelby for a start. And the winner of the 1959 Le Mans has form. Retired due to a heart problem, in 1966 he's now building AC Cobras. Such a beautiful car. But to build a car to take on Ferrari is a different animal. And needs a pure racer, in the form of mouthy mechanic Christian Bale's Ken Miles, who's looking for the perfect lap. A wrench may be the sum of their abiding brotherly love for each other.I cannot say I'm a fan of motor-racing, but Le Mans '66 had me on the edge of my seat, with definitely no drag in the 150 minute run time. But Ken Miles was not Ford's first choice of driver for their new GT40. Josh Lucas is the nasty Leo Beebe, soon to be Ford Racing Director, and determined to keep him off the team. He and Ken get off to a bad start with the unveiling of the new Ford Mustang. And Ken does have the sort of temperament to say anything on camera. That makes the Ford suits a little uneasy! But you have to love Christian Bales's bluntness. I feel sure this is another Oscar worthy performance from Bale, among a very talented cast. And he spars well with wife Mollie, played by Catriona Balfe, and Noah Jupe is his adoring son. But Ken has to drive because it's in his blood. Fuelled by British tea. And he has the courage to drive a car at 218mph in the Le Mans Mulsanne Straight. The GT40's top speed, as Ferrari looked on. Let's just hope the car can hold it together, with a throaty engine shoehorned in. And pray the brakes don't give out. As Shelby says, at 7,000 revs man becomes machine, and James Mangold makes you feel every one of them.But Ford's entry into Le Mans was not without disaster. And when Henry Ford II is idling in the slow lane on the track with Shelby one day, he puts his money where his mouth is. And through the tears, tells Shelby to go to war. The driving seat is now 48 year old former tank driver Ken's to lose. But first he has to win the 24 Hour Daytona.I cannot pretend to know much about the technology of the car, but I thought Ray McKinnon's Phil Remington adding go faster strips was great fun. They were really for the aerodynamics of the car! But what a rocket blast. Behind the scenes below explains better with Christian Bale.With cinematography by Phedon Papamichael, amazing photography and a cracking storyline, James Mangold proves that a driving based film can have massive appeal to all. A terrific job.",10,1,2,26 November 2019
Rocketman," Rocketman Film Review - Dexter Fletcher Directs Taron Egerton In Elton John Crystals As He Hits A Dodgers Home Run
","Having helmed Bohemian Rhapsody to Oscar success Dexter Fletcher is once again in mission control for Rocketman, with Taron Egerton donning the platforms and glasses. In 2013 I saw Sunshine On Leith, Dexter's first film, and loved it. He clearly has a handle on musicals. Giving plenty of the old razzle dazzle. Exactly what Elton John has. Funnily on holiday recently I met a guy who had actually been at school with Elton; then the young Reginald Dwight from Pinner. Was he always someone that stood out?, could you tell he would be a star? I asked. In fact he thought that Reg was just a fat kid with glasses who had no foreseeable signs of greatness. Well looks can be deceiving because look at him now. I may one day even forgive Elton for that shameful Snickers advert. That may have broken my heart!Taron was excellent, as were all the kids as Reggie. I first saw Taron in Eddie The Eagle, then Kingsman, Sing and recently in Robin Hood. He has the voice and isn't afraid to don the feathers for a romp through Elton's back story. The script by Lee Hall and produced by David Furnish was always going to be sympathetic to Elton. But this is no Pg-13 story, as Elton said, his life was R rated, and there's no hiding in a chicken suit; he wants it to be told. And promptly checks his tangerine ass into an AA dream.Unsurprisingly the film has the feel of Billy Elliot, also written by Lee Hall, with a gorgeous rousing bop through the mean streets of middle-class Pinner. (My old stamping ground!). Elton's fantasy started with talent, a tune picked out on a piano by Matthew Illesley as the young Reg, and a Gran, played by Gemma Jones, who was interested in her grandson. Mum played by a love starved and almost unrecognisable Bryce Dallas Howard, and an emotionally clipped war damaged father played by Steven Mackintosh, almost sink Reggie's early promise. Singing their own solos of unhappiness. And with his start in life Elton deserves every joy he now has. Shy young Reggie just wants a hug.A tinkle on the ivories by Kit Connor as the teenage Reggie at the Royal Academy of Music, and a nice moment with Harriet Walter, playing her classical piece by ear, what a precocious talent he was even then, leads Reg to rock and roll and adulthood, where Saturday Night Is Alright For Fighting. And a life on the road with a band.Lovely Charlie Rowe as Ray Williams gives the reinvented Elton an envelope of lyrics in his bosses Denmark Street office, see if you can make something of these. Songwriter Bernie Taupin is Billy Elliot's Jamie Bell and they come up with songs. Dick puts them in front of his boss, the terrific Stephen Graham's Dick James, of Dick James Music. Their music is rubbish, but Dick, pushed by Ray, sees potential. With Your Song they're on a trip to LA, and gigs at the wildly flamboyant Tate Donovan's Troubadour club. The stakes couldn't be higher, with Elton locked in the toilet and pop genius's in the audience. But he takes off as the gig defies gravity. If it feels emotional it's because it is, the papers are full of Elton's success, and he storms the charts.Bernie is the songwriter in the shadows, I know nothing about him, I guess that's the way he wants it. Elton is the flamboyant showman with diamond shoes, loving and loved by his lifelong writing partner, even after they (never) row. And while Jamie's Bernie was a straight A kind of guy, I vehemently disliked John Reid, a dastardly Richard Madden. In this R rated film of Elton's life, this guy was a Class A dick. But a totally believable dick, the manager muscling everyone else out, and in his sharp suit getting his 20% of flesh, in more ways than one. The same guy from the Bohemian Rhapsody story. A real Killer Queen. And pushing Elton to the limit. But there is no spending limit, Elton is a millionaire. And forcing him to come out to his mother, who like all mothers, already knew, but condemns his lifestyle choice to a life of never being loved. And sending him in his Rolls round to the now happily re-married, once more with feeling for old times sake Dad?, okay still stiff upper-lip father.The music of the partnership plays like a greatest hits jukebox, that accurately, naturally!, matches the highs and lows of Elton's life. The melody of a tune we all know, tried out for the first time on a piano. How amazing that Elton could see the notes to fit Bernie's words. And how emotionally stilted were those around who couldn't see him.In my youth I remember 'I'm Still Standing' as my first intro to Elton John, with the video and jazz man outfit, Taron edited into the original, and the unhappy first wedding that added respectability to the flamboyant Elton. John Reid whispering in his ear again. Funnily it was 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart' with Kiki Dee that brought Elton and John together again, after their first meeting in LA.All of Elton's music is virtually on repeat on the radio so feels so fresh. And because I don't remember them the first time around, I don't care about the ipad shuffle of songs and dates as much as the purists. It's as if they were written only yesterday, and yet Elton has been a titan of the music industry for 50 or so years. His life has been one of strops and petulance, with Class A wild living and sex orgies, and trying anything once, as he swallow dives into the pool! And yet what a man that has made him. Maybe he was never really there. But Bennie and the Jets would beg to differ. He used to be so wild, but now we can call him Sir.With costumes by Julian Day, from the black and white childhood to the fun you can see he had recreating those wild designs, as Taron looked so precious in over a million Swarovski crystals. Gorgeous cinematography by George Richmond and music by Matthew Margeson. Riffing on Elton's back catalogue down the yellow brick road.An outrageous technicolour ode to excess with Dorothy ruby platforms, and I loved it.",10,3,5,5 June 2019
Us," Us Film Review - The Rabbit Gets It As Jordan Peele Directs What Happens When The Lunatics Take Over The Asylum
","Jordan Peele's highly anticipated second horror outing Us leaves us with many questions. In 1986 young Adelaide wanders off alone to a funhouse and in the hall of mirrors encounters a version of herself. Even wearing the Michael Jackson Thriller t-shirt her dad just won in a fairground game for her. Yes that's weird, but how? Her parents are understandably distraught when she is found, but what happened in that funhouse stays in the funhouse, with Adelaide unable to speak about it.Fast forward to the present day and the now grown Adelaide, played by Lupita Nyong'o, is driving with her family to the Santa Cruz house where she spent that long ago summer. Winston Duke is wisecracking husband Gabe, with kids Zora and Jason. Jason played by Evan Alex, and true to his namesake, likes to wear a mask and wears a Jaws t-shirt. We might be safer in the water this time! Shahadi Wright Joseph's Zora is like any teenager attached to her phone.And Gabe's bought a boat for the summer, it doesn't work too well, but it's still a boat he can tell his friend Josh about later that sunny day. On the way to the beach they pass a murder victim being lifted into an ambulance. We remember he was in the fun park when Adelaide was small and carrying a sign saying Jeremiah 11.11. Adelaide tells the kids not to look. The Wilson family meet up with their more affluent friends the Tylers. The already sozzled Kitty played by Elisabeth Moss, and Josh played by Tim Heidecker, with their twin girls.Much like Adelaide when she was younger, Jason wanders off and comes across a man standing on the beach in a red jumpsuit with blood dripping from his fingers. But he doesn't tell the worried Adelaide what he saw, until she later notices a drawing he made of the encounter. The now spooked Adelaide tells Gabe of her own childhood all those years ago, and how she feels something is coming for her, Gabe lightheartedly jokes that when the storm blew the lights out that evening, it possibly was herself she saw in the funhouse full of mirrors. Understandable, but when the power goes out at 11:11, and Jacob says there is a family outside, the tension, with score by Michael Abels, could be cut with a pair of very sharp scissors.Main plot spoiler!Having set the scene for us Jordan Peele now sets to work unravelling a big ball of string all the way down to the many miles of underground America, and ties us up in knots. For this is no white rabbit filled Wonderland we know.What if our governments experimented on us? What if they tried to control out minds by duplicating us? Could we have clones that we didn't know about, yet who mirror everything we do above ground, tethered to us like puppets attached with strings. And even wear our exact same clothes. Are they Us if we hadn't had the opportunities in the sunshine? And what would happen if these doppelgängers living underground in the shadows found out about our lives above? Would they feel we had stolen a life that could have been theirs, if they had been given the chance? And if so who would lead them above ground? Surely someone who had actually been above ground!A terrific thinking movie, with great acting across the board. Not so much a cover your eyes horror, more a terrifying social experiment that went badly wrong. A great duelling pas de deux and many many questions.",Null,1,1,28 April 2019
Yesterday," Yesterday Film Review - Hey Dude Danny Boyle Directs A Love Story To The Beatles Without Coke & Cigarettes
","Yesterday written by Richard Curtis offers an interesting premise, what if no one had heard of The Beatles and their songs? Danny Boyle directs the unsuccessful singer Jack Malik, played by Himesh Patel, as he strums his guitar around Suffolk. His manager Ellie is the gorgeous, but dowdy, Lily James, a schoolteacher by day but roadie/driver when he plays a gig. And when Jack lands a spot at Latitude it's the big time. In the Suffolk tent with a handful of kids and his friends as audience. And that's it, he's finished with music. Playing his Summer song to seagulls and empty cafes. But miracles can happen says Ellie, like Benedict Cumberbatch becoming a sex symbol, she suggests. Cutting! But Jack is unconvinced as he rides off on his bike, and just as his life couldn't get any worse, the world suffers a 12 second blackout and he's hit by a bus in the darkness. Knocking him out cold, and his front tooth.And the weirdest thing is when he recovers and Ellie and Jack's friends give him a new guitar, seeing as the last one is now firewood, he christens it by playing Yesterday. We've all strummed a guitar and played a Beatles riff or two, but Jack's friends have never heard Yesterday before. And they haven't heard of the Beatles, and neither has Yahoo. Pope John Paul II! It seems Jack is the only person on Earth who knows John, Paul, George and Ringo. And with no one having heard of the Beatles, songs that John Hannah said in Sliding Doors, we are all born knowing, passed along to the fetus, Jack suddenly has a whole new body of work. If he can only remember the words.And when Jack plays the songs for the first time it isn't only his new audience that sits up and listens, well to be honest they don't, it's a slow burn, like playing bars in Hamburg. But for us it's like we're hearing them for the first time. And their power is as strong as it was when they were first played, before we were born. Well except the first play of Let It Be could have gone better, a screen gem in front of his family. Mum and Dad are hilariously played by Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar. They aren't expecting much from Jack's music.And as well as a love story to the Beatles there is a love story that should have developed between Jack and Ellie. But as Jack never noticed it, over time they became just friends. But Ellie always holds a candle for him, why else would she manage his unsuccessful music career, he's her Wonderwall. Even without Oasis. And now as he plays the Beatles greatest hits, fame beckons when the Ed Sheeran offers Jack a gig as his supporting act. Ed is a good sport accepting his inadequacies over Jack's talent. Yeah Hey Dude didn't work. But Back In The USSR goes down a storm, in Russia. The Beatles never actually played in Russia, but imagine how Back In The USSR would actually have gone down.Kate McKinnon is Ed Sheeran's manager Debra, and she offers to also manage Jack, Ellie cannot just leave her school teacher job to go with him and Jack is the biggest thing in music. To be honest Debra's pretty upfront about the deal in her downward dog, she'll make him a star and take all the money. Fair enough I suppose as he ripped off the Beatles, but nobody knows. And as luck would have it fortune favoured Jack who could sing and play guitar. Otherwise he would just be a lonely person remembering all these hits that he couldn't sing. Although without the Beatles where did the yellow submarine come from I wondered? But this is everything Jack always wanted. Fame and fortune. And he never even knew what he was missing with Ellie, but it's never too late. Love is all Jack needs.I was at some point waiting for Paul and Ringo to appear but Yesterday is a fantasy so why not a fantasy end. And in that strange universe I wonder was it a fair deal? Death and immortality or life and anonymity. It was a terrific idea to spin the Beatles jukebox, and imagine no Coke or cigarettes, saving the NHS a fortune. But even in that strange universe Harry Potter isn't going to write itself!Danny Boyle directs a great cast with summer loving, happiness and comedy, and just keeps the hits coming. Terrific fun.",10,0,2,12 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Marvel Avengers: Endgame Film Review - The Final Battle Directed By The Russo Brothers With No End Credit Easter Eggs This Time
","When Brie Larson arrived on Earth at the end of Captain Marvel she found the remains of Nick Fury's Avengers, the survivors of Josh Brolin's Thanos and his Infinity Stones grab. In Marvel Avengers: Endgame the Russo Brothers must band together this smaller group of superheroes to find Thanos, retrieve the Infinity Stones, and bring back their fallen comrades. The stones must then be returned to their original time in the past. Easy we might imagine in a film with a 181 minutes running time. I saw it opening day but you won't notice the length as it moves at warp speed.We can see who survived Infinity War from the poster, and thanks to Captain Marvel she brings Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark back to Earth after his fight with Thanos, with Karen Gillan's Nebula and Bradley Cooper's Rocket, into Gwyneth Paltrow's waiting arms. But there's no time to reminisce as Nebula knows where her father was going after Infinity War. But having achieved his aim Thanos destroyed all the stones.And with no way to bring back the 50% of the population destroyed, five years later our superheroes have found either domestic bliss, as in Pepper and Tony, Chris Evans's Steve Rogers is running grief counselling sessions, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow and Don Cheadle's War Machine are running the depleted office and well Hawkeye is really really angry about losing all his family and in Japan taking out gangsters. Jeremy Renner never got an answer to his mustard or mayonnaise question.Then one day an inquisitive rat presses a button in an old van and we get Paul Rudd's Ant-Man back. And he's a little surprised as to what the hell happened in the last 5 hours he spent inside the quantum realm. And given that time is altered in the quantum realm, maybe our superheroes could travel back to collect all the stones and click their own fingers to bring everyone back.
But Tony Stark isn't interested, he has his own family and doesn't want to change time. So maybe another brain might be able to create the quantum tunnel. A really big brain. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk has embraced his green side and is happy to take selfies with kids. And while I read of the year long training and diet that Scarlett Johansson followed for the back-to-back filming of both Infinity War and Endgame, well Chris Hemsworth's Thor has really let it all hang out. He got it easy this year. Nice to see Taika Waititi back as Korg. But having already done his bit with Thanos, Thor is quite happy drinking in the Asgardians' new homeland.And yet Tony Stark cannot quite stop thinking about a trip Back to the Future. And is even more amazed when his testing actually proves it is possible.So that's six stones to find; Time, Mind, Space, Reality, Power and Soul, and only one chance for each of the remaining Avengers to find them, and return, with their limited vials of Hank Pym's serum. Not everyone will survive as they split up to find the stones. But what great stories they'll have to tell about their adventures in the past. Although someone has discovered what our superheroes are up to. And he's coming.I've been following the Marvel Avengers films, and the Marvel Agents of Shield tv series for a long time now, and Endgame is a fitting climax. Cramming everyone from Marvel into the story line was no mean feat for the writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, but I think everyone made it, even with the blink and you maybe miss them scenes. But the You and Whose Army was mind blowing. Could Captain Marvel have done it all herself I wondered, maybe, but where's the fun in that, anyway she cannot turn back time, and the Avengers have always been a team. Even when they fell out and had civil wars.With a rumoured budget of $400million the film was a hit the first weekend. Great fun and if you didn't enjoy it you don't have a pulse. Was it the final scene for Stan Lee though?",10,1,3,6 May 2019
Toy Story 4," Toy Story 4 Film Review - Can Woody Save The Spork In The Last Chance Saloon - Josh Cooley Directs Child's Play Terror With All The Fun Of The Fair, Badass Bo & Keanu Reeves H
","Watching the beginning of Toy Story 4 the animation was incredible, the opening scenes looked like a live action that would then merge into animation. Pixar were a revelation with their first Toy Story, and 24 years later with Toy Story 4 it's heartbreaking for Woody, voiced as usual by Tom Hanks, as he sees his girl Bo Beep given away by Andy's sister Molly. These are animated toys and yet director Josh Cooley gives them life, and we feel real empathy for them. For their sadness and then joy when Woody and the gang got a second chance with new owner Bonnie in Toy Story 3. But now Sheriff Woody is collecting tumbleweed in the cupboard. His badge is given to Sheriff Jessie, little girl Bonnie's law enforcer is female. And her doll Dolly is in charge of the toys, when it used to be Woody, who sadly now just watches what happens from the last chance saloon. Will he get another chance at happiness?On Bonnie's orientation day at kindergarten the shy little girl is on her own at a table when the mean kid tips her pencil and pens into the trash. Yeah we know what would happen to him if our toys got hold of him. Remember Sid? But concerned Woody, even though he has been forgotten and left in the cupboard, went in her backpack to kindergarten to keep an eye on Bonnie, and jumps out to gather the arts and crafts from the trash. And Bonnie happily proceeds to craft herself a spork doll from a fork that was actually in the trash, and a pipe cleaner. (I had never heard of a spork before this film).Bonnie just needed a friend. And when they come home and Woody introduces Forky, voiced by Tony Hale, as a new toy that Bonnie has made, well the toys are a little bemused. No more than Forky himself, who is hilariously determined always to be looking to jump into trash. That is his destiny as trash, to be used and then discarded.But through the magic of childhood wishes, Pixar has brought this utensil to life, and he becomes Bonnie's new favourite 'toy'. So when Bonnie's parents take the family on a road trip, Woody takes it upon himself to save the spork. And it's a full time job. When Forky jumps out of the window of the moving RV, Woody jumps too. No toys are left behind has always been the motto. See you at the next RV stop he says in goodbye.The humour is still there with a cracking script and this time the Child's Play terror is provided by a creepy baby doll with Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween style ventriloquist dummy minders. They'll creep you out at any age.Having persuaded Forky how important he is to Bonnie on their way back to the RV, Woody is attracted to a lamp similar to Bo's in an antique shop window. And he and Forky pop through the letterbox. Big mistake. The tinkling china Bo Peep voiced by Annie Potts, managed to escape from here with her kid sheep; Billy, Goat and Gruff. And now she's a badass lost toy in her bloomers at the travelling fun fair in town. But inside the shop the creepy vintage doll Gabby Gabby rules with her dummies. She has a defective voice box; voiced by Christina Hendricks, and never got to share tea with an owner. She just mimics the actions from her cabinet. Of course Woody has a working voice box....and Forky is the leverage.New toys are introduced to the story including an Evel Knievel style stunt motorbike doll I remember from my childhood, voiced by the strangely wooden (plastic?) Keanu Reeves. His Canadian Duke Caboom toy was rejected on Christmas Day all that time ago, because he couldn't actually perform the stunts on his tv commercial. Having realised his limitations, he now lives in the store waiting for, but not expecting, a new owner.And what of our Toy Story regulars in the RV? Tim Allen's Buzz Lightyear gets a starring role listening to his conscience, just like Woody, although Buzz is directed not by his inner voice, but by his voice commands. And when his voice sends him on mission to go find Woody, he meets two soft toys pinned to the same fairground stall wall he finds himself on. Voiced by Keegan-Michael Key as Ducky and Jordan Peele as Bunny, they will never be won by a child. And don't want Buzz getting the chance either as they've been up there the longest. The desire to have an owner is the overbearing need for a toy. But they are a scream with their ever increasing fantastic attempts to save Forky. And when Bonnie's toys club together for a sat nav return to all the fun of the fair, it feels like we're back in Andy's room all those years ago, with Hamm, Rex and Slinky on the gas.It's a blast, and if this really is the Last Chance Saloon, then we're escaping to the open road with a high 5 from Keanu Reeves. (Stay for the credits).",10,1,5,1 July 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood Film Review - Quentin Tarantino Directs His 9th Symphony With Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt & Margot Robbie In A Story That Might Have Been
","If we could change time then Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood is the 160 minute fairytale about what really happened in the Hollywood Hills one summer night in 1969. With Leonardo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton, a stammering cowboy on the set of a tv series called Bounty Law, the one that isn't Bonanza, and his stunt double Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth. Cliff is not doing so much stunt work, but mainly driving Rick around, since he lost his license for being DUI. And although Rick's popular, he's getting to the end of his tv cowboy career with his show just being cancelled. Maybe he should try Italian cowboy films suggests Al Pacino as producer Marvin Schwarz. But Rick's not ready to eat spaghetti yet. Not with Pilot season coming up. But Marvin Schwarz and his wife love Rick and he's really keen for him to consider it. He can only take so many punches as the fall guy. Maybe that should be Cliff?Back at home high up the Hollywood Hills, Rick glimpses his new neighbours he's never seen. Only the hit director of Rosemary's Baby; Roman Polanski, and new wife Sharon Tate. And we know the countdown has started to what is coming in this loving pastiche to razzle dazzle Hollywood. Tarantino takes the faded backlots of the late 1960's Hollywood movie sets and mixes them with stunning cinematography by Robert Richardson. Filming shots at the real spots that Sharon visited and adding a flavour of Taco Bell to the Hollywood Boulevard set.Cliff drops off Rick and his nice car, to work on his lines, I love Rick's way of working (!), and drives his own wreck to his home on the wrong side of the tracks. A trailer with his well trained dog Brandy. Cliff may have got away with murder in Hollywood, did he or didn't he (?), but he's certainly not living the high life. Although he seems like he's just doing fine, and Brad is looking pretty damn good.Margot Robbie is on fire as Sharon, arriving on a Pan-Am flight, just like her character in the cancelled tv programme of the same name. I thought it was great. She was an air-stewardess, but here she's flying first as the sweet young actress who one day goes to watch herself in her latest movie. Looking around, just in case, before she puts her glasses on. But loving the audience's reactions to her klutzy character. The costumes throughout by Arianne Phillips nail the era's vibes with Brad's Hawaiian shirt, he's so cool, and Rick's wanna-be leading man in his tan leather jacket. And Margot's costumes are amazing, that black polo and white mini skirt and boots will have a fashion moment.And while Rick and Cliff are drinking and slowly sliding into has-beens, Sharon; Hollywood's latest new young thing, is living the high life, partying with the Mamas and the Papas and other celebs at The Playboy Mansion. The music is a highlight and Damian Lewis an almost unrecognisable Steve McQueen giving his opinion of Sharon and her marriage to Roman. She has a bright future ahead of her in the Hollywood studio system. And when the choreographed lights get switched on at twilight in Tinseltown, the stars come out to play. Cliff would dearly love to be included in their circle.But in those Hollywood Hills are also a feral family of hippies, they need to go to Vietnam (!), instead scavenging in bins for LA's left over food, and led by the infamous Charles Manson. Cliff and Rick see them around town, we only catch Manson himself in one scene, skulking around at the Polanski home. But Pussycat catches Cliff's eye. Margaret Qualley, who recently played an exquisite Ann Reinking in the delicious Fosse/Verdon, is the underage temptress. Look out for her highly arched ballet feet! But Cliff's too smart to get caught out. And drops her home at the old western ranch where they filmed Bounty Law. Here the 'family' are living, and he's the stranger in town. But he makes it clear that he wants to look in on the owner, played by Bruce Dern, to make sure he's okay. Cliff can still kick a door down if he needs to, and Dakota Fanning is a particularly nasty Squeky. But she can read how a scene would otherwise play out, as she lets him in.And when Rick lands a role with Kurt Russell as stunt co-ordinator, he takes on Cliff as a favour to Rick. Much has been made of the scene with Mike Moh's Bruce Lee. I did read that Bruce was criticised for being too hard on his stuntmen. Well rightly or wrongly Cliff evens the score, but gets fired for his services to stuntmen everywhere. But don't worry, Rick has a DIY job for him. Shirtless with a tool belt, are you kidding Quentin? Brad's still got it.And Rick is still landing parts in pilots and gets a prized Sam Wanamaker gig. Meeting his young co-star Trudi, played by Julia Butters, he describes the book he is reading to her in one of the films most tender moments. But when he fluffs his lines in Lancer he really takes it out on himself, did he break a mirror or was that my imagination?, but being hungover is no illusion. He knows he needs to quit. And when he nails the shoot with Trudi, they are fantastic, well he's still got a part in an FBI themed pilot screening tonight. And of course Marvin loves it and it's a spaghetti dinner all round.And while Rick and Cliff are in Italy making westerns, Sharon has been feeling uncomfortably pregnant in LA. Husband Roman is away filming and she has her friends over on this hottest day of the year. The day Cliff and Rick fly back home with Rick's new Italian wife. This is getting tense, we all know Tarantino's on screen violence. And while Cliff is smoking an acid trip while walking Brandy, Rick is making a frozen margarita and his wife played by Lorenza Izzo is sleeping off the jet lag; a dark car creeps up the Hills towards Sharon.You can do all you like about the violence in Tarantino's films, I'm sure there's more violence in the gaming industry where you pull the trigger, and critic Caspar Salmon at The Guardian really got his knickers in a twist about the ending! His review is a real spoiler so don't read if you haven't seen the film yet. But for me Hollywood is Tarantino's best. With the greatest and most well deserved violence. An amazing cast with a host of guest cameos and plenty of parts for the children of Hollywood's celebrities, Once Upon A Time is the fairytale I want to remember. It has comedy and pathos in equal measure. Brad and Leonardo are a delicious double act both at the top of their game, did Margot Robbie have less lines? Did I notice? No, because with Tarantino her Sharon Tate was luminous and the role to remember.Tarantino's 9th Symphony will be remembered as his masterpiece, a fabulous love story to Sharon Tate and Hollywood.",10,21,33,24 August 2019
Aladdin," Disney Aladdin Film Review - Guy Ritchie Directs Will Smith As The Fresh Prince Of Bazaar In A Whole New World - It's Quite A Ride
","Hands up I've never seen the Aladdin animated Disney film, know none of the songs, except A Whole New World, and haven't seen Robin Williams as the genie. But everyone knows the story of Aladdin and Guy Ritchie's new live action offering was fresh and vibrant and oh so colourful. So gather round children and listen to the story invites Will Smith, in a clever opening segue from Disney.Some critics are seething with indignation that Disney are making money by turning their beloved animated films into live action fun for all the family films. And for today's woke generation Disney are also using actors with dark skin to play characters historically famous for being dark skinned. And women want to make their own rules. not live within those dictated by men. What's not to love about this?We can almost smell the scents of Agrabah as the spice traders set up their stalls and the market is filled with fresh produce. And in the middle of this Arabian fantasy is Aladdin, played by Mena Massoud, and his partner in crime Abu. Any relation to Marcel the monkey? Streetwise Aladdin knows a little about running a hustle and helps out Naomi Scott's Dalia, a handmaiden to Princess Jasmine, who has given street kids food from a trader's stall. With no money to pay for them. Employing his trademark frantic chase and parkour action, Guy Ritchie keeps the story moving along as Aladdin and Dalia swing by to Aladdin's crib, where naughty Abu steals Dalia's bracelet, and she leaves thinking Aladdin is just a common thief.But after this first meeting Aladdin is in love.And meanwhile out in the desert at the Cave of Wonders a diamond in the rough finds out he was just another cubic zirconia, as the ceiling crashes down around him. And Marwan Kenzari's unlucky Jafar, Advisor to the Sultan, must find another. For there is a lamp to be found and a kingdom to be stolen.Back in the palace Dalia who is really Princess Jasmine, meets her new royal suitor, Prince Anders played by Billy Magnussen, the token white guy, and royally hamming it up. Loved him in Game Night. But Jasmine is not impressed. Instead telling her handmaid Dalia about the guy she met in the street. The only way for Jasmine to escape the palace and see what life is like for her people is to disguise herself among them. And into this case of mistaken identities lands Aladdin with the bracelet. And a pot of tea. Nasim Pedrad as the real Dalia plays along as Princess Jasmine. He's cute, and Jasmine's tiger Rajah seems to like him. I likened Nasim's portrayal of Dalia to Rosie O'Donnell's Becky in Sleepless In Seattle with her quick one liners. Very funny.But watching Aladdin from afar, Jafar's parrot Iago thinks he might have found a diamond. And Jafar steals Aladdin away to the Cave of Wonders.What an amazing place it is, CGI'd to within an inch of its life, with incredible piles of gold and jewels as big as Abu's head, and a magic carpet. But once allowed into the magical cave, for Aladdin is the real diamond in the rough, he is told only to take the lamp. Little Abu however couldn't resist the shiny ruby and the cave crashes around them. Jafar promises to help Aladdin out of the cave if he first passes him the lamp, as only a villain would say, but with sleight of hand Aladdin keeps the lamp as he crashes to the ground.So let's recap where we are, we have a thieving monkey, a magic carpet and a lamp in a cave. And maybe mimes the magic carpet, if we rub the lamp we might get out of here. And boom. The genie is out of the bottle with his three wishes. Will Smith is the Man in Blue with a song and dance routine he has been practising for a thousand years. Being the Master will take Aladdin some time to get used to. But Genie is very helpful with his guidance. And maybe the first wish is we get out of the cave. Although Aladdin's second wish to be a Prince gives Genie far more scope to shine. But be specific with your wishes, and of course you cannot ask for three more wishes. Our Aladdin is a quick learner.And what a Prince Aladdin becomes, with genie magic hiding his true identity. Bringing riches to the palace, with a Disney razzle dazzle spectacle of an entrance, and lots of jam. To buy the princess. Okay so that didn't go well.Jasmine and Dalia are a great double act to the new would be suitors, both looking for something else in their lives, with Genie as Aladdin's wingman and still two wishes left. Trying again Aladdin takes Jasmine on the centrepiece Whole New World magic carpet ride, it's slightly sandy to be honest, while Genie woos Dalia. And surely everyone can end up happy. But who could love a street rat and a genie?And suspicious of this new Prince from an unknown land, Jafar is not easily beaten, and employs all his cunning to try to trick Aladdin, steal the lamp and become Sultan. And yes he's 'that guy' realises Genie who sees another lifetime locked up in the lamp. And Jasmine for all her royal privileges is expected to marry a prince who will become Sultan when her father dies, instead of her, when she knows so much more about her own kingdom. And could rule better. And poor Aladdin will be poor Aladdin again, if the princess finds out he isn't a prince.If only there could be a Happy Ending.With stunning costumes by Michael Wilkinson and Production Design by Gemma Jackson, Aladdin is a kaleidoscope of colour. To be honest I couldn't hum any of the tunes afterwards, other than A Whole New World, sorry to Alan Menken, but they worked in the film with the lively Bollywood style song and dance. As a theatrical event the film was terrific. Wonder how it compares to the stage show. And a big thumbs up to Guy Richie who managed to create the magic, with lots of action and laughs, and a talented cast who radiated such fun.I enjoyed it very much and I'm already looking forward to Lion King. And dare the critics to find fault with it.",10,1,3,12 June 2019
1917," 1917 Film Review - Sam Mendes Directs A Desperate Game Of Life Across The No Man's Land Of WWI
","The Battle of the Somme is long gone in the stark April sunshine of 1917, as Sam Mendes directs a desperate dash through No Man's Land, with the historic still images of the Western Front vividly brought to life. Colin Firth's General Erinmore has an urgent message to send to the Devonshire regiment further up the front line. Do Not Attack, he has seen aerial footage that shows they are walking into a trap. But the German have cut the telegraph wires, and the only way to get through to Écoust-Saint-Mein is on foot.The orders are given to the boyish Dean-Charles Chapman's Lance Corporal Blake, and he picks George MacKay's Lance Corporal Schofield to accompany him. The Germans have retreated out of their trenches, and the path will be clear, but the two young soldiers are given hand grenades in their pack. Just in case! In The Lord of the Rings, Frodo and Sam's chances of reaching Mordor were slim. 1600 men's lives depend on Blake and Schofield's game of life to get the message through. But like our Hobbits, their chances are equally slim, and to add urgency to the journey, one of the soldiers due to go over the top is Blake's older brother. They have until dawn to stop the attack. And will have to cross No Man's Land in daylight.As they force their way through the trench to the front line, the camera follows at their shoulders, Andrew Scott's Lieutenant thinks the journey it's madness. Fighting for every inch of the land and then to suddenly have the Germans pull back. But he 'blesses' the two soldiers with his whiskey, riffing on the 'Hot Priest', and tells them to send a flare up if they make it. Otherwise they'll try and pull them back when night falls!Cutting the way through the hostile barbed wire, cinematographer Roger Deakins sweeps the camera across the stinking mud. But the landscape is silent as Blake and Schofield creep their way across. While the words of the WWI poets ring distantly in our ears. What tolling bells for those who die as cattle. Wilfred Owen's lament, past the bloated soldiers submerged in mud, past the horses unable to outrun the guns, past the ghosts of once trees. As clouds of flies fill the air and scurrying rats feast on the dead.The action plays as a single shot of the day, immersing the viewers in the real time carnage of the story. The pock marked battlefield is the star, with Production Design by Dennis Gassner, as Blake and Schofield face the eerie horrors, and eventually tumble into the German trenches. These were well made for the men to dig in, but now empty save for a lovers photograph. But the Germans have not made their retreat easy, with leaps of faith in the pitch black booby trapped potential tomb. And a later aerial dogfight brings the fight to the ground, with an act of mercy that leads to catastrophic results. Sam Mendes isn't afraid to show the PTSD among the men, with George Mackay particularly good at looking shellshocked. I've followed his career since Sunshine On Leith, in that joyous musical he was happy! But here his face is perfect for misery.But the message must get through, with the camaraderie along the way of those brave young men and boys going off to fight who knows where. Mark Strong almost unrecognisable, but full of support and help as his men are also headed towards the Devonshires, but must divert when a blown up bridge bars their vehicles route. A sniper taking shots halts the rhythm of the film, throwing us into darkness, until we stagger round for the final push. Écoust-Saint-Mein is within reach just downstream, but in a nightmare town Germans are blowing up the remains in their retreat. The camera following any way they can as we run to the river, bullets whizzing past while red flares half light the ruined town. And with dawn breaking the tension is relentless. In exhausted relief we hear the sound of silence and a lone singer. Jos Slovick and his soulful Wayfaring Stranger.But it really is a final sprint to deliver the message, with Deakins incredible filming again and shells exploding over men just to our left, and the force knocking us down in those last moments of urgency to stop the whistles blowing.Among the terrific ensemble cast were cameos including Daniel Mays, Richard Madden and Benedict Cumberbatch. No one stealing the limelight though, just getting on with the job in those precious hours, and hoping to live another day. Watching the film felt like a lifetime in the blink of an eye. All those lives that didn't grow old, and those that grew old far too early, but came home. Very poignant with a tight crew that deserve all the awards coming their way.",10,2,3,18 January 2020
Midsommar," A24's Midsommar Film Review - Ari Aster Directs Florence Pugh Through The Circle Of Grief To Trippy Rebirth With Jazz Hands
","With A24 and Ari Aster as director, Midsommar was always going to be filled with gore and horror after his first film Hereditary. And the 140 minutes runtime sped by with another unsettling story..After a family tragedy Florence Pugh's grieving Dani is grudgingly invited by boyfriend Christian to join him and his friends at a pagan Midsommar festival in Sweden. Jack Reynor was going to dump clingy Dani but how can he do that now? To the disappointment of his college grad friends. One of them Pelle, played by Vilhelm Blomgren, invited the group to his commune's festival and it only happens once every 90 years so it's a special event. He's thrilled Dani is coming along. He among them understands her grief as he also lost his parents. I'm sure there's a story there...we'll figure it out.And when they get to the commune the scenery is stunning, with blue skies, wild flowers and friendly locals in folky white embroidered clothes. How can horror be hiding in the midnight sun? With some choice hallucinogenic drugs to ease you into the vibe. The bear was a surprise, but Dani's room had naive style paintings including a bear and a child, so it all fitted into the pagan setting so remotely separated from society.Will Poulter's Mark eased the tension with his comic lust for the comely Swedish maidens in their frocks, and the commune members do seem very easy loving. While one of the anthropologist's, William Jackson Harper's Josh, is writing his thesis on pagan rituals, so his mind is blown with the thought of the nine day festival. Pelle's brother Ingmar played by Hampus Hallberg also brought guests from London to take part. Archie Madekwe's Simon and Ellora Torchia's Connie are as excited as our Americans to be there.The Hårga community believe in a circle of life, from birth to 72, when you then fall off a cliff. I was reminded of Logan's Run, but here age is just a time to begin the renewal of life. But shocking to those outside the commune. Simon and Connie are like us, and abruptly leave the next day. Without saying goodbye.But Josh explores deeper into the rituals for his thesis, while Dani joins in and helps bake pies with the women. And Mark is finally going to get some Swedish loving, although he's off his face. And when Christian is bizarrely told he has been chosen to be the lover of one of the girls, he is served one of the pies, and discovers the young girl's secret ingredient. You want to avoid the food and drink at this festival.But the accommodation is stunning, with a beautifully folky decorated communal building for each of the four stages of the Hårga to live in. That will sell it to the tourists. Our friends are all to live in the 'youth' hostel.Meanwhile Dani is becoming enchanted with the commune, and when she's made the May Queen she even starts speaking Swedish like some fairy magic is at work. And she's taken off to bless the fertile earth as Christian discovers that sex is a spectator sport here. And it all takes place with the scenery shimmering in the background like bad photoshop. But here it's just a very bad trip, and Christian is going to live to regret it when Dani gets back from her day's blessings.Initially with the buzz of the movie I was expecting a Wicker Man, and some of the filming hinted at a chosen maid, a secret building and a massive unveil. But nothing quite prepares you for the truth as Ari gathers his players for the finale, with stuffed puppet skins, still live action, excited jazz hands, and maybe a touch of John Updike's Hotel New Hampshire. Nastassja Kinski was the one in the bear suit then. This time though not so much fun.The performances all round were spellbinding, Florence Pugh howling with pain and anguish is exceptional, while gore is mostly kept well off screen, but we get to see the after effects such as when Simon is beautifully dressed in flowers. And Dani is sensationally clothed in a meadow cape of flowers as May Queen. The glorious costumes are by Andrea Flesch who also did the costumes for Colette. Worth the price of admission for them alone if you like fashion.But it's Ari's horror story that will stay with you. The realisation that it was all as it was meant to be. And horror and dread can indeed live in the most beautiful of places. I thought the ending was much better than Hereditary. And way more shocking. Not a scare by jump horror, and not for everyone, but you'll know if it's your type of festival.",10,3,9,14 July 2019
Joker," Joker Film Review - Todd Phillips Directs Joaquin Phoenix As A Joker Who Is No Fun But Sure Knows How To Make 'Em Laugh - It's A Comic Tragedy
","Arthur Fleck in Joker is as much a victim of Society as his unfortunate victims. Working at a clown agency with a medical condition that makes him laugh uncontrollably, it's not a funny business for him. He asks for more mental health help, more pills, more than the seven he already takes a day, but Social Services are cut and his pills and therapy part of it. He is abused and attacked at work and is it any wonder he finally snaps. Having a gun should be illegal anywhere. But this is comic book Gotham and these things happen. Todd Phillips directs Joaquin Phoenix as a Joker we can initially sympathise with, while we watch his rage build, and his descent into the Gotham madness begin.Arthur lives in a crummy apartment with his Mum played by Frances Conroy. He is her gentle carer and watches his mother Penny Fleck as she keeps writing to her ex-boss Thomas Wayne for help. Played by Brett Cullen he isn't listening. And the mood in the street is getting darker with a garbage strike and giant rats scuttling round town. But the mood is light in the Fleck household because they enjoy watching Murray Franklin's nightly talk show together. And in Arthur's head Murray played by Robert De Niro is waiting for him as a guest. For Arthur is a would be stand-up comedian, although Penny drily asks whether you need to be funny to do that. She's a wag, but she has a deep dark family secret buried in Arkham Asylum, one that will see Gotham burn. It's a Shakespearean tragedy.But Arthur does his comedy homework and learns his trade by watching other comics. Jotting down what makes people laugh. He even meets a girl down the hall and invites her to his first stand-up show. Zazie Beetz's Sophie is not as embarrassed as we are. Make 'em laugh isn't something that Arthur can do, except for his own maniacal laughter the place is silent. But someone is filming.So Arthur still keeps up his day job, the sad thing is his clown makes kids in a hospital laugh, until a gun drops out of his outfit. Well that's a scream, and of course he's fired. And so is the gun. Mayoral hopeful Thomas Wayne pitches the 'clowns' against the rich, after three of his staff are killed. Causing mass demonstrations in Gotham. We're all clowns now. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher and production design by Mark Friedberg is fantastic, a retro 70's Gotham City, (check the WB logo), and like the pre-gentrification of 80's NYC I remember.Joaquin Phoenix was incredible, he lost 52lbs to play the poor pathetic Arthur. Each sinewy movement of his starved body taut when he practises his quiet tai chi, or maniacal ballet, and all the while straining against the pressure cooker building inside his head.When the police finally track Arthur down, his mother is home alone when they call, and after suffering a stroke is rushed to hospital, where Arthur and Sophie sit with her. They watch as Murray Franklin shows the film of Arthur's stand-up comedy routine that night. It might not have made the punters laugh, but overnight it makes him a tv star. Finally Arthur gets his chance at prime time tv. But how to play it? He needs to practise. It's funny and sad as he copies the guests on the programme. Creating his entrance. We will him to succeed. Could this be Arthur's shot at being the next King of Comedy. Because Arthur does now feel he exists. The poor and wretched of Gotham all exist now. But was he ever really there? Was Sophie ever really there?And for his much longed for tv appearance and his opener. Should he thank his mother first?, she nicknamed him Happy after all, telling him to spread joy and happiness in his miserable life. Should he thank his fellow clowns for their help, because Glenn Fleshler's Randall gave him the gun that helped get him here. They'll all get their turn. But Leigh Gill's Gary is too small to even open the door. Maybe he doesn't deserve any thanks.And maybe after all he'll not even go on as himself, he'll go on as Joker. With amazing hair, make-up and costume created by Mark Bridges, and he'll just tell the truth. And see if they laugh. But you can be sure his act will blow Murray Franklin away.Outstanding work by Todd Philips in an amazing film. As an origins story we are given the bare bones on which the future of Gotham hangs. And DC is definitely in a dark place with this tragic comic who dances a Catch Me If You Can finale.",10,1,1,11 October 2019
It Chapter Two," IT: Chapter Two Film Review - Time To Come Home As Director Andy Muschietti Takes Us On A Really Long Stephen King Fun Fair Ride
","Andy Muschietti again directs the Stephen King clown horror as we open with the Losers Club swearing their oaths to return to Derry if IT resurfaces. And when the all grown up Isaiah Mustafa's Mike hears on the police radio one night that there has been a killing, he visits the site of the murder and finds a message for them written in blood. COME HOME. And for an almost three hour long movie it rattled along, to the point when it ended I felt there was more to come.After the trauma of IT the members of The Losers Club have drifted apart and eventually lost touch. Living their adult lives with, in some cases, the same demons of the past. But now the horror they have since forgotten as adults has resurfaced 27 years later. And they need to return and renew the blood vows they took as teenagers. And reface the horror.Bill Skarsgard returns as Pennywise, taking a big bite out of Derry, and Isaiah Mustafa, Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, (great in Trainwreck), Jay Ryan, James Ransone and Andy Bean play the grown-up Losers. Although not too shabbily as they all have made successes of their lives. Except Mike who remained in Maine remembering their past.And when Mike calls his old friends, none remember him or that past. Not even why they have a scar. When they do the intensity of the fear is rekindled. Dare they go back?Jessica Chastain's Beverley has the foresight to see their deaths, of all the Losers Club members she was the only one exposed to Pennywise's deadlights. But she runs to Derry when she gets the phone call. Escaping her life. James McAvoy as a horror writer badly in need of an ending, is Bill, whose brother Georgie was Pennywise's victim in the original IT. And who Beverley believes to be her old secret admirer. Bill Hader is Richie. Stand-up comedy hiding a secret that Derry seems particularly bad at dealing with. Jay Ryan's Ben is the former fat kid, now a buff wealthy architect hiding away in his stunning masterpiece, and keeping his human contact to zero. James Ransome's risk averse Eddie is married to a plus-size lady, and she makes him just as neurotic as his Mom did. Lastly Andy Bean is Stanley who decides not to make the journey. To be honest I needed the recap as to who each character was, and the matching of the original kids to their adult actors was very inspired.Those that have come to Derry meet Mike at a Chinese restaurant, in a lovely scene the years slip away and they're back as old friends. But the fortune cookies do way more than give good luck. With comic book gore that as a 15 certificate I knew wasn't going to be scary, but the fun fair effects were frankly disappointing. But enough to frighten off our Club members.But Mike needs them to stay and perform a ritual on IT that he learned from a Native American tribe who had settled in the area years before. Explaining to James McAvoy who has assumed a childhood lisp brought on by his fears. Impressive and not unlike his Split characters. And they all need to be part of it. Even Stanley.IT feeds on their fear and they have plenty. And each has to bring an artefact from the past to the ritual. The young actors from IT reprise their roles as we explore the source of the adults fear. I think Beverley's worked best with the creepy old lady now living in her childhood home. I don't know if Eddie's was even real. But how could Jessica Chastain scream like a girl, after her life and what she has seen.Overall there weren't the jump scares that would make a horror scary. The horror was right at the beginning of the film, hidden in plain sight. And no town needs a Pennywise for that. But beware the bleachers and Fun House I would say, as danger lurks for any child who wanders off alone. And from my original review of IT in 2017, Derry loses a lot of children.Although the film horror was a disappointment and I have looked forward to it for so long, the actors were fantastic. Bill Hader's comedy was laugh out loud funny and the interaction between the two casts very cleverly directed by Andy Muschietti. All the wonderful young actors are named in my IT film review.And what of the ending in the rain sewers below the haunted house? Each of our Losers had their artefact from when their fear began, but they finally have to face the fear to find themselves. And in some cases each other. Again with the fun fair CGI effects, but it all seemed like there was a better story to tell. Like I said at the beginning something more to come. Pennywise was demonic wasn't he?, then make him demonic. As I haven't read the book I don't know how true the ending is, but I needed a big red balloon of a bang instead of a Harry Potter style rollerskating spider.As a drama it worked very well, as a horror not so much, but the comedy was inspired. Watching Bill Hader and James Ransome trying to decide which door is really the less scary for them to run through was hilarious. Fingers crossed there's a cute puppy behind one of them. A great double act.And Stephen King's input was noted, 'Here's Johnny' was unexpected but played in with the trailer for Doctor Sleep before the film. The follow up to The Shining.And as a horror fan I'm already looking forward to that one so don't let me down.",8,0,0,17 September 2019
Parasite," Parasite Film Review - Bong Joon Ho Directs An Oscar Winner That Trump Dismisses
","Parasite won Best Film and Best Director for Bong Joon Ho at the Oscars this month, also winning International Feature Film and Original Screenplay. Neon the distributors suggested that Donald Trump, (leader of the free world) unsurprisingly didn't like it as he cannot read. Harsh. My only gripe with subtitles is I cannot always watch the screen action as I don't want to miss the words. You get used to them of course but like Pedro Almodovar's Pain And Glory I missed some of the beautiful designs. Caught that on demand prior to the Oscars as it wasn't available anywhere locally. But missing out on world cinema and tv because of subtitles is very sad.To be honest Paradise is a horrible film. With horrible characters living a horrible life. A black comedy, horror tragedy that reeks of the class divide between a successful South Korean family and their poor contemporaries. And the living conditions are startling, with the poor living in a basement with a window on a street that is regularly urinated in. Just in front of them. And piggy-backing off their upstairs neighbours internet connection. We take pleasure in laughing at their hovel while our wealthy family live in the most architecturally perfect modern home we all would imagine living in. Bravo to the Production designer Lee Ha-jun for realising this on a sound stage.So while our wealthy Park family smell of money, the poor Kim family smell of whatever you can imagine poverty and that bug infested basement smells of, and it isn't nice. Old radish our rich husband played by Sun-kyun Lee suggests. But things are finally looking up for the loving Kim family. Not with the pizza boxes they construct for minimum wage though. Instead son Ki-woo played by Woo-sik Choi is recommenced for a tutoring job with the wealthy Park family. His rich friend who currently tutors the young daughter wants to romance her when she goes to college. We can see where that might go.And for Ki-woo the Park family live in another world, as he climbs out of the basement. Mrs Park played by the lovely Yeo-jeong Jo goes about her day supported by terrific housekeeper Moon-gwang. To be honest Lee Jeong-eun keeps the house running as Mrs Park is a little on the ditzy side, but in awe of her young son's 'artistic' talents. He needs an art tutor for sure, and once saw a ghost she confides, although his sister sees right through him. But what are the chances that Mi-Woo knows of an art tutor, very in demand and just returned from Chicago I think. So So-dam Park's Ki-jeong also climbs out of the basement and spins the gullible Mrs Park a line of Google babble that wins her the job. Mrs Park even spins herself the lines as she accepts Ki-jeongs. Although the Park family are really lovely. But as these two chancers have managed to begin feathering their nest, they are actually good at what they are doing. And with the right opportunity both wasters could have aspired to the same roles, without the deception.But deception is what they do and Ki-jeong sees an opportunity for her Dad played by Kang-ho Song, to be the new driver to Mr Park. Her actions in getting him the role left a bad taste in my mouth. Getting her art tutor job didn't hurt anyone. But after a wash and brush up Mr Kim can actually drive, cornering without spilling a coffee in the hand of Mr Park. And now our three hustlers spy even more opportunity for Mum to get in on the action when Moon-gwang's peach allergy is discovered, and Mrs Kim's Hye-jin Jang is recruited as the new housekeeper. All the Park's money for staff now goes directly into the Kim's pockets.But with all the family out of the basement their smell has followed them. Something that the Park's son notices. All are perfectly capable of doing their jobs but with their bad odour they pollute the beautiful home. Where do they go from here then? How do they grab this beautiful life for themselves? Well one dark and stormy night the poor cross the line. The veneer of respectability can disappear in an instant and ghosts can materialise from basements long gone.But all actions have consequences as Bong Joon Ho directs the poor fighting over scraps from the table of the rich, when they could have shared instead. But why should they share the scraps we ask? If his first film was called Barking Dogs Never Bite, Parasite will show us that with enough antagonism they will. But I don't blame the Park family who gave employment to the poor to facilitate their comfortable lives. They are incapable without them. Each class living off the other.And there is no answer of course to the film's questions, only the international language of morse code desperation to decipher, and never be able to respond to.",10,9,13,22 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," JoJo Rabbit Film Review - Taika Waititi Directs Scarlett Johansson Doing Whatever She Can With A Hitler Mad Son, A Ghost In The Attic And Sam Rockwell Leading The German Camp
","In the dying days of the Nazi Third Reich Taiki Waititi creates a film that lets us laugh at the comic Nazis, but throws in moments of peril. They might be goons during this springtime in Germany, but they still have guns.Young Roman Griffin Davis's 10 year old JoJo is best friends with Taika Waititi's imaginary Hitler, and we meet the Führer encouraging timid JoJo to attend the local Hitler Youth Camp, with his 'second best friend' Yorki, played by Archie Yates. Both outsiders and happily so, running like demented leprechauns in the woods with the wacky Adolf.The camp is designed for boys to learn to hunt, shoot and kill for Hitler, while the girls learn domestic science and how to be good Aryan mothers. Much to their disappointment! Rebel Wilson is hilarious as Fraulein Rahm. 18 babies for Hitler and counting. And Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf is comically brilliant, wounded earlier on the front line he now trains the Hitler Youth. With assistance from his Sergeant Finkel, played by Alfie Allen. A good German couple best keeping quiet. And our own good little German, so full of his hero worship and desire to serve Adolf, but cannot quite bring himself to kill a poor little rabbit. Hence the unfortunate nickname he picks up, as well as a hand grenade. This daring and (funny) action that nearly kills him, may just have saved his life.Having Hitler as an imaginary friend is a pretty extreme affliction, but Taiki Waititi's Hitler does, among the Heil Hitlering, offer JoJo moments of support when he needs it most. Encouraged him to go to camp and JoJo Rabbit will be as welcome in the Third Reich as a lion. All helping the lonely boy.Back home and off school recovering, the scarred and limping JoJo, no longer able to fulfil his dream to become one of Hitler's bodyguards, and still unable to tie his shoelaces, is taken by his mother Rosie to the local army office. Played by Scarlett Johansson, Rosie insists, in no uncertain terms, that Captain Klenzendorf include and make use of JoJo. And makes Klenzendorf, having been demoted there after the grenade incident, feel her and JoJo's pain!While JoJo continues learning how to be a good Nazi with Hitler. Jews are bad, of course they are in Nazi Germany. But how do you know if you have met one? And what would you do if you did? For the small German town is a colourful and happy place for JoJo growing up, with no Jewish monsters lurking anywhere. And Rosie looking after her confused son, and washing down the craziness of her life with a bottle of red. Scarlett Johansson on top form.But there are more ways to be a good German in Nazi Germany. Although many of them will get you hung in the town square. What did they do? JoJo asks Rosie. Whatever they could! And when JoJo finds 'ghost' Thomasin McKenzie in the attic eaves of his dead sister's room, he has a crisis of his Nazi faith. If he reports her, young Elsa warns him, it won't be just her who will be taken away, so will his beloved mother who has hidden her. So they agree to keep secret that JoJo knows about Elsa in the attic. While Rosie tells Elsa in their secret night meetings that JoJo is such a committed Nazi they cannot let him know. So begins the comedy of errors as JoJo and Elsa meet secretly every day for her to tell him all about being a Jew. Things like how she hangs upside down like a bat and will have horns when she's older. And she can read minds too. Although not German minds of course, they are too stupid! All details for the book JoJo is writing for Hitler. And perhaps moments of comedy and joy for the fragile Elsa, who has the heart of a lion, but whose very existence is dependent on this strange little 10 year old. And Elsa is a good influence on JoJo, with Adolf losing his grip on the love struck boy. And not happy about it. But Jewish Elsa may not be the monster after all, not when the Russians coming from the East allegedly eat people! Pick your villains wisely JoJo.And while JoJo collects the town pots and pans as 'scrap' metal for Germany, Yorki is conscripted to the army and dressed in his new paper like uniform; cardboard! We know that the Reich is nearly done, sending prepubescent boys to fight. What a hoot Archie Yates is though, soon to be seen in the Home Alone reboot, and could have almost won the war singlehandedly for the Allies. But when Stephen Merchant and his Gestapo goons visit the house, the Heil Hitler comedy suddenly gets serious. With Klenzendorf and Fingel also turning up unexpectedly. One would almost think something was up. And as the house is searched, Elsa is found.It seems far enough away from the horrors of WWII to be able to laugh, but at the time there was nothing funny about Elsa's experience. Yet Taiki has reimagined the horrors through the innocent eyes of a 10 year old, and cleverly turned them into laugh out loud comedy. After recounting his 'imaginary' interrogations of Elsa, Klenxendorf finds JoJo's ludicrous descriptions of Jewish people hilarious. And the sight of Klenxendorf and Finkel racing into battle with their trademarked uniforms, against the newly arrived Americans and Russians, was a camp sight to behold.With a terrific cast of children the film had tremendous heart, and our hope that JoJo will do the right thing plays until the end. The vulnerable Elsa totally dependent on his decisions. We want him to be a good German just like Rosie. And he definitely needs a good slap. (Of course this was a different time!). But eventually there is hope.",10,1,3,12 January 2020
Midway," Midway Film Review - Roland Emmerich Directs The American Naval Fleet To Victory In WW2
","Roland Emmerich takes the action to the Pacific in Midway. When years earlier as Naval attachÃ¨ to Japan, Patrick Wilson's Edwin Layton's advice is ignored by his bosses, and the Japanese had a free shot to take out Pearl Harbor in December 7 1941. And as we know the neutral US then entered WW2. But new Commander of the Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, played by Woody Harrelson, is prepared to listen to Layton, the man who tried to warn Washington, and his code-breaking intelligence staff, in the future. Interestingly a band from one of the sunken Pearl Harbor ships increased the code-breaking team. Their knowledge of music useful in identifying patterns in the intel they picked up. Fascinating. And with Brennan Brown's Joseph Rochefort in charge of the code-breaking team, it felt like The Man In The High Castle alumni with Luke Kleintank. This time on the same team.Midway wasn't the beginning of WW2, not for Europe anyway!, and it wasn't the end, but I watched a tv programme a while ago that showed how unprepared the US was at the time. Their torpedoes failing even to blow when hitting a Japanese ship. And Japan had a commanding Naval fleet that dwarfed the US. That would rapidly change over the course of the war. But the US had oil, which the Japanese did not have. And fortunately the Pearl Harbor tankers were not hit.Of the men that will win this battle, Ed Skrein's Dick Best is a maverick in the air. A pilot who practises by cutting off his engine to see if he can still make it. His co-pilot is none too happy about the practise runs! Best's friend was killed at Pearl Harbor and we know he will take his plane to the wire. Much to the chagrin of his superior officer Luke Evans's Wade McCluskey. And Dick's daredevil exploits are what's kept him from promotion. His gutsy dive-bombing will be much needed. And Admiral Nimitz hopes there are more like him when they go after the Japanese Fleet. With pal Clarence Dickinson played by Luke Kleintank, this is an all star cast of sailors and airmen. Dennis Quaid is Admiral William 'Bull' Halsey of the USS Enterprise. I do hope the Star Trek USS Enterprise was named after his ship. And the courageous Nick Jonas as Bruno Gaido, firing a stationary plane's gun at a dive-bombing Japanese plane, to keep his Brothers-in-Arms safe. What a star, and he gets promoted for his services by Halsey. And then walks the plank. All of them heroes and all mentioned at the end of Midway with flying colours.With Midway Island picked up as the Japanese next target by our former tuba players, god love em; to win the battle was crucial for the US, if it were to fall, Hawaii would be next and then the West coast of the US. But back in Tokyo the Japanese are unaware that their messages are being decoded, and the enemy are crossing the Pacific Ocean to be ready for them. But Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, played by Etsushi Toyokawa, we met him at the beginning in peacetime with Layton, knows they have woken the beast that is the USA.I wasn't so sure about the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo led by Aaron Eckhart, the Japanese reprisals against the occupied Chinese seemed too high a price to pay for a few bombs on Tokyo. The end credits said that Nimitz did get to sail into Tokyo Bay on the USS Missouri to accept the Japanese surrender. Far more satisfying.A fun bit of real life trivia was John Ford actually filming at Midway and got more than he could ever have hoped for with his live action filming. And what a feat of engineering when the USS Yorktown holed out after Pearl Harbor, sailed to war in 72 hours. It wasn't just airmen that won this battle.And Roland Emmerich definitely brings the battle to life, and while I wouldn't turn on the tv to watch an old war film, I thought Midway was fantastic. Very exciting with an excellent cast. I'm not going to pretend that it all seemed like a blur at times, because to the guys on the ground it probably was too. War happens at a ferocious pace and I didn't think Emmrich let anything get in the way of telling the story. The CGI special effects were well done and the photography and sound was breathtaking. I cannot recommend Midway highly enough.",10,5,7,29 November 2019
