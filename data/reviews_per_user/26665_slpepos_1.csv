The Monuments Men," Worst movie
","I won free tickets to go to the movie and we went and it was the most boring movie we have ever watched. My husband who loves action and history movies fell asleep. I ended up going on the internet on my phone. Just very boring and do not recommend. It's expensive to go to the movies. Do not recommend. The movie drug and was just simply a boring movie. The story line was dull at best. We expected a better movie and it just didn't hold up to the movie trailer's we viewed. I am sure it followed the true story of what happened, but we expected much more for a WWII movie. There were some funny parts, but they were few and far between. My history buff 17 year old would find the movie boring as well. Onto the next movie.",1,40,72,15 February 2014
