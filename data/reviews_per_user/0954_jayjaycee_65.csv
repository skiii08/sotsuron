Blade Runner 2049," Some questions will always be unanswered...
","'Blade Runner 2049' is a 2017 science fiction thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford. It took more than thirty years for this sequel to hit the big screen, decades after the genre defining classic questioned the values of what makes us human. Now we got a continuation to the story that famously sparked several discussions that fans to this day approach. Many considered it unnecessary, some hoped to get their desired answers. I can tell that both sides were probably disappointed. Like its predecessor the scenery is overall uncomfortable, rainy and filthy, it has the same infamously depressing and dismal tone to it. Ryan Gosling's performance of the Blade Runner K is tacitum, robotic and distanced, but all the while subliminally cool. It most likely appealed to me, because it reminded me of his character in the ingenious 'Drive'. Also, I personally liked how the film used the key elements and themes of the original and advanced them even more and adapted them to our 'modern comprehension' of a futuristic society, such as the usage of virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Most of it comes alive by the magnificent cinematography of Roger Deakins, not unsubstantiatedly awarded with his well deserved academy award. The play of colours and visual effects perfectly support the visually stunning images and it was an even bigger treat for the eye on Blu-ray. Nevertheless, it still has some mild weaknesses: The film itself is extremely long and has a lot of quite scenes and the story progresses rather slowly and some characters lacked a specific depth (Jared Leto's Niander Wallace e.g.) and could've been more fleshed out. But that's just a small remark. The story itself is fantastic though. It offers a whole new level of cleverness and fits with the original story in a respectful way. With several clever and misleading twists it builds up a mystery that raises more questions than before and it barely answered the one you had already. It's also studded with plenty of references and connections to the 1982 film, such as cameos and small details - and of course the appearance of Harrison Ford in his iconic role of Rick Deckard. All in all, this thriller is a worthy successor to the classic, as it narrates a mysterious story that packs you. It might be slightly too long, but it's worth it all the while. Additionally, it might not be as deep and philosophical as the original, but it still delivers a great experience lead by a charismatic Ryan Gosling. Many fans might be upset that they will not get the answers they needed, but I think that has always been the concept of this franchise. Who is human and who is a replicant is a discussion that will never come to an end, and even more importantly: Is Deckard a replicant now? We will never know, except they decide to do another sequel, I personally hope not...",8,1,12,1 December 2019
Scarface," The rise and fall of an antihero
","'Scarface' is a 1983 crime drama directed by Brian De Palma starring Al Pacino and Steven Bauer. As many others probably did, I celebrated the legend's birthday as well by watching one of the most popular and mainstream gangster flicks of all time, a film I've been kicking down the road for way too long. Admittedly, this turns out to be a massive mistake, as this film is nearly perfect by all means. The main factor of this films success is without a doubt Pacino's versatile and above all menacing performance as rising gangster Tony Montana. He's definitely is absolutely credible in portraying a Cuban compatriot. From an authentic Cuban accent to his overall demeanour he was excellent, but what surprised me the most is how one of the most popular gangster film protagonists is undeniably one of the greatest antiheroes in cinematic history at the same time. Screenwriter Oliver Stone created an iconic main character with such a diverse personality that you really can sympathize with in a strange manner. Over the course of the film, Montana lives the classic American dream and literally goes from rags to riches. With a runtime of almost three hours one could mean that it has its lengths and might become boring after a while, but the screenplay never gives you the opportunity to lose track. There's always something more happening, and the suspense curve starts on a medium level and goes up continuously from there on. Never does it take a hit once and it's almost masterful to see something like that happen in such a long movie. Generally, the longer the movie, the higher is the probability that the film loses the interest of its audience at some parts (like some Scorsese flicks, for instance), hence I think it's nothing short of incredible that this film manages to perfectly avoid this common effect. If you need to look up a film with a perfectly paced plot development, this film is the showpiece example for this question. As I already stated before, all this wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for the force of nature of a person that Tony Montana is. The titular scar faced maniac is something I'd show a class when it comes to characterizing an antihero, because he's an extraordinarily conceptualised and multidimensional fictional character the film would be nothing without. In the beginning, he's a nobody, a political refugee who works as a dishwasher who tries to aim for the stars without any realistic plan, but he's ambitious and on top of that, determined and fearless. His intrepidity eventually pays off and gradually becomes more successful and doesn't seem to be willing to stop. What makes this character development so outstanding though, is the way he reaches his goal and how he secures his position. His insatiable hunger for power makes him totally unpredictable. The more power he gains, the more he disassociates himself from the values he used to believe in, and he more and more becomes a monster. This inexorably increasing greed simultaneously increases his mistrust and severe paranoia towards everyone and everything. While he still had a sense of rudimentary loyalty in the beginning, he's become more merciless from minute to minute. He would sell his own grandmother if she was a threat for is power status and it's evidenced by how he betrays every former associate and partner, even his mentor in the process and how he underestimates even the ones who are obviously more powerful than him. Pride comes before the fall and you can clearly tell that his judgement is successively tainted. The most fascinating thing is how it seems to never be enough to him, as many scenes show how he is palpably bored by his carefree life. Seriously, he seems to have everything he's desired, the wife, the wealth and the power, yet he is unsatisfied with it and desires more. For instance, the scene where he sits in his own office, drunk and hooked on an immense amount of cocaine and the way he still looks like the most bored human being on earth is one of the many scenes that made me smile for just how brilliant it was. Even though he went sky high and should be happy with the way he is, he still craves for a higher place that exists from his point of view. Furthermore, he depraves everyone around him, allies and foes alike and destroys all of their lives with his reckless behaviour. In the end, he can't tell the difference between friend or enemy. Do you know those moments in a film that conclusively consolidate your suspicion of watching a cinematic masterpiece? Well, in this film it happened again. With several scenes that impressed me there's this one scene rather in the end where Tony shoots Manny after finding out he had a sexual encounter with his sister, only to find out that they got married a day before. Pacino's reaction after realising that he made a severe mistake, his heart breaking in the matter of seconds, the way the hate immediately leaves his face and makes way for regret was this one breathtaking scene. That's how I also come to another thing that fascinated me deeply, a single character trait that actually contradicts his general personality: Family. Even though it's depicted that he would do anything to keep his position of power, there's this strange sense for family that makes him vulnerable. Next to the way he cares about his sister Gina, there is this one specific scene where he prevents the innocent wife and children of a target person from being killed, aware of the fact that this will lead to his own death. The ruthless gangster boss gives up everything he has achieved for ... family? This is exactly what makes this character even more fascinating and saves the last bit of humanity in him. Nonetheless, he receives his legitimate punishment for his extreme cockiness, in a scene that's iconic as it is powerfully symbolic. Montana who indirectly declared himself a god-king is ultimately reminded by his own mortality and all the mistakes he's made that lead to his inevitable fall, his death being the only logical consequence and price to pay for his acts. All in all, this gangster drama is a masterful character study about a man and the way he parishes by increasing power and the unquenchable thirst for money, the way he treated all the people on the way and how he eventually faces the consequences. Pacino delivered an outstanding performance and almost singlehandedly made this film a huge success, as he made the antihero of this compelling crime drama come to life effortlessly. Sophisticated, extremely entertaining and with sheer brilliance in acting and writing, this film absolutely impressed me and it feels like it will have a bigger impact on me than I expected. Shame on me that I have not watched it earlier and the fact that I only own it on DVD. The next time I see it on sale, I will upgrade it without thinking too much. That is what I owe this masterpiece.",10,0,0,26 April 2020
Sucker Punch," 'One flew over the matrix' - nice summary, but not as brilliant
","'Sucker Punch' is a fantasy action film directed by Zack Snyder starring Emily Browning and Abbie Cornish. There are not many directors in the business who are despised by some and simultaneously praised as a genius by others. Before he became sort of the 'godfather' of the DCEU he established himself as someone who knew to entertain with mindless fun flicks and mediocre remakes of horror classics, such as '300' or 'Dawn Of The Dead' and this reputation is palpable in this production as well. With each and every film of his filmography it's either hit or miss, hot or not, you either love it deeply or absolutely hate it. I have mixed feelings with this one. By all means, it's definitely not a great film, but I'm surprised that it had the right ingredients to become so good and a well made action flick, the premise is extremely interesting, but well, what am I to say? It's a Snyder film in the end. I'm having the feeling that his personal motto concerning film making is 'style over substance' and I think that's the quintessence of it all. It's his eccentric directorial style that results in stunning visuals and stylish colours, but it's not making up for the basically nonexistent plot and storytelling. A phenomenal cast that consists of both excellent actors and promising newcomers plays a bunch of shallow and forgettable characters that really could have been fleshed out more. The only performance that exceeds the hurdle of mediocrity is Oscar Issac's. He surely made the best out of his messy lines. Furthermore, I'd consider myself as someone who's able to shut off his brain and enjoy some good action, but even though ZS aimed to create this, I'm surprisingly disappointed that he even failed to reach this goal. The over the top action sequences are basically nothing more than generic choreographies in slow motion, mostly filmed from unusual and experimental camera angles. When an action film doesn't succeed to entertain me and makes me prefer the quiet sequence between them, you know what's going on. At least there was a brilliant choice of songs for the soundtrack that thoroughly fit the atmosphere of the film. Next to subliminal antifeminist tendencies (believe me, it desperately tries to be the opposite, but in the end it fails to do so) and excessively sexualized female protagonists, it also has a lot of average CGI effects in it. Don't get me wrong, the leading ladies all are bombshells (especially Vanessa Hudgens. You know, childhood crush), but I think that the screenplay doesn't treat them with enough respect and basically reduces them to the role of just looking sexy while playing out what appears to be a male fantasy. Also, was that in the end supposed to be a plot twist? Within the first three minutes I saw through the dilletant attempt of a compelling three-layer plotline. The only thing in it that amazed me was the message behind the almost totally hidden metaphor that the only one who's able to overcome mental illness is oneself. This uplifting aspect made me feel good. But that's it. All in all, this genre mix tries to cheat on the audience by simply looking stunning and wants you to ignore the disastrous plot, shallow characters and boring story. It had endless possibilities to be something greater, but Snyder decided to live out his messy style instead and ruin a promising premise. Once again, he proved that the only one standing in his way is himself. It's such a pity, really.",5,1,4,11 February 2020
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Friendship is infinite
","'The Perks Of Being A Wallflower' is a 2012 drama directed by Steven Chbosky starring Logan Lerman and Emma Watson. In modern Hollywood, there are countless films that belong to the high school sub-genre and in most cases they are nothing but an entertaining mish-mash of stereotypical characters and generic love stories. In most cases though, they are still a great pleasure to watch, but something inside of me is still unsatisfied with it, as it yearns for a specific type of originality that just hasn't been there in most films I've watched so far. I knew I was in for something special when I felt that already within the first minutes of this romantic drama this feeling hasn't accompanied me in the slightest. Based on his own novel, writer-director Chbosky helmed the movie adaptation of his drama himself and who else but the one who invented the characters and their story around them is capable of bringing it to the big screen magnificently? That's probably a huge advantage, as he knows what's the core of his narration and how it needs to be brought to life. To be honest, he's done an impressive job. First of all, the cast is absolutely well chosen and it was a great decision to let newcomers play the protagonists (well, except for Ms. Watson, of course). The main trio consisting of Charlie, Sam and Patrick are some of the most well conceptualised characters I've seen recently and Lerman, Watson and Miller didn't just portray them magnificently - the made them come alive. They all are extremely likable with their weird natures and way of getting along in society. It felt like I knew them for my whole life as I followed them through the depicted ups and downs of being a teenager on the verge of graduation. The film's basically a coming of age story centered around the friendship of high school students, but even though it has a pinch of stereotypes in it, it manages to distance itself from them and immediately create something more outstanding and takes an absolutely original direction instead. What impressed me the most is how the film's characters are far away from being perfect and also have problems they struggle with. Although it's never named directly all of them obviously suffer from some sort of mental illness and/or trauma and I think that's a brave decision, as it's not just the bright side of school life, but the shadow side as well. In an equally insightful manner it also doesn't hesitate to depict the benefits and problems of sexuality. I take my hat off to the decision to make Ezra Miller's Patrick an openly gay character and I think it's an outstanding move to thus give people struggling with their sexual orientation a voice and telling them that it's all but a bad thing. Cause it simply isn't. Furthermore, it teaches an important message about growing up and the importance of friendship in general. The chemistry between the characters is simply genuine and thus the approach to say that good friends is all you need works out so well and shows outcasts, loners and wallflowers that there are others like them and that they are never alone in this world. Next to this, the film has a wonderful and sensitive pace that allows the viewer to experience all the emotions in a never boring way that could not have been any better. The film grabbed me from start to finish and I never lost my curiosity for it in any way. It's tremendously touching and heartwarming and heartbreaking all the same. Also, the twist in the end came out of nowhere and was as heartbreaking as it was beautifully elaborated, as it thus has given Charlie even more depth to his already struggling and troubled character. All in all, this romantic drama is equally heartwarming and heartbreaking and combines so many particular aspects that make it reach perfection. From outstanding character development to a fitting soundtrack it has it all. It's a magnificent drama that gives those a voice who struggle, who don't know how to deal with their lives and who go through so much and think they are alone and teaches them that whatever they go through, that they always have friends and that they are never really alone with it. It's a perfect drama. The final scene when they drive through the tunnel, with David Bowie's 'Heroes' playing over the stereo during Charlie's monologue, with this incredibly touching camera work and inspiring words - that's when I knew that this film deserves nothing but a full score, as it has given me goosebumps and made me cry for it's sheer beauty. This film is one of a kind and one of the best of the last decade. Perfection!",10,0,0,13 March 2020
Skyfall," The Unshaved Icarus - Bond at his best!
","'Skyfall' is a 2012 action thriller directed by Sam Mendes starring Daniel Craig and Javier Bardem. The Road To Bond 25 and the saga continues with an entry that's an obvious improvement to its dull predecessor. Whatever 'Quantum Of Solace' tried to be in the first place, this feature learned from it's mistakes and steeped up again in terms of quality and intelligent entertainment. Not only does the title song performed by Adele sound magnificent, the whole concept works out pretty well again. Already the breathtaking train sequence is so much better than all the action of the previous film in total and that's only the beginning of what the film continues to offer. While the 'fake death' aspect wasn't quite necessary for the film's development and was sorta abandoned in the matter of minutes, it definitely left a mark on the agent with the license to kill. While it has already been one of his most original character traits since they rebooted the franchise, it's even more palpable in this case that he's not immortal and can't take everything. He's not the cold-hearted and emotionless killer with cool one-liners anymore, he's shown more and more that he's vulnerable and on top of it all, a mortal human being. I think that's by far the most interesting character development of the saga. He's literally an unshaved Ikarus who tries to do his jobs that, in most cases, are almost impossible to master and that's what gave the whole story a new kind of thrill to it. In the past, I was always sure that he'd master his mission like it was no big deal, but from there on all of this security is all suddenly put in jeopardy. Furthermore, the film again combines what made the first feature so interesting - a perfect balance between heart racing action and intense thriller. In this case, the story is divided into three acts that basically feel like three different movies in one - and that's all but terrible. With the villain Silva, a mental performance by Javier Bardem, Bond has an antagonist again who really manages to stand his ground against Le Chiffre in terms of roguishness, as he's actually a threat as a former agent who knows the MI6 and all of its secrets oh too well. Also, not only does it finally flesh out Bond's employer M even more and gives her a special spotlight, it also finally introduces a few of the classic allies, such as Q and Eve Moneypenny. On top of it all, Mendes has hands down the best cinematographer on his side, Roger Deakins, and as I expected it from the luminary of cinematography, he captured the intensity of the film with some outstanding frames and an extreme amount of iconic eye candy moments. Additionally, I have to praise the stunt choreographies that literally gave everything to keep us on the edge of our seats. Learning that Craig did most of his stunts on his own deserves my deepest respect. Oh, and that final is also a masterful contribution of drama that once again has shown the emotional range of Daniel Craig. All in all, this film is more than solace for the debacle it's predecessor has been and again offers so much quality, in both action and thriller elements and creates such an ingenious and packing plot that hasn't bored me in the whole run time of almost two and half hours. It's almost perfect, like the first outing, and shows that you don't need mindless explosions to create an action/thriller hybrid. It's gritty, intelligent, ingeniously conceptualised and most importantly, unusually dark, as it shows the mortality and vulnerability of it's hero like never before. This is Bond at his best and although I can't really expect it, I deeply hope that the successor will at least be enjoyable. Til then, I'm gonna admire this piece of art.",9,0,3,17 March 2020
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Michael Schofield, is that you?
","'Resident Evil: Afterlife' is a 2010 action horror film written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson starring Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. With the so far worst of the films behind me, I couldn't stop myself from still being excited about the following films despite my brain telling me that it's more than a terrible idea to be this hopeful. What else to expect now that the most amateurish and untalented writer-director of all time has also returned to being fully in charge of helming the project? That's right, another disaster. Still considering himself one of the best in the business, he once again created another messy screenplay and enacted it himself. Once again, I'm asking what meaning most of the scenes had. Already the beginning is absolutely ludicrous as it's nothing but a mindless shootout with obvious and terrible CGI that was neither innovative nor somehow entertaining to watch. The film features 3D, you say? Oh, that's probably Anderson's inducement of including mindless scenes like this. Dozens of unrealistic clones shooting up the Umbrella facility in such a ridiculous and useless manner? We totally get that you love to display your real life wife, Paul, but please do something with more purpose next time. Seriously. After this, it's obvious that the film ultimately decided to go full action movie and leaves its horror roots behind completly. With every entry to the series we stray further from the games and yet the film still pretends to be anything related to the original game series. What do you expect from a dilletante like Anderson? A clear and well conceived plot structure and story that knows how to respect its source material properly? Keep on dreaming. Yet, compared to 'Extinction' it's still a minimal improvement in terms of continuity, as it is at least plausibly connected to the previous installment (in an Anderson type of standard, at least). It leads Mrs. Badass herself on the quest of finding Arcadia on the way to Alaska, just to have the whole story take place in Los Angeles anyway. I'm not gonna question that anymore. With the main focus lying on the action elements, the atmosphere disappeared completly. It has been sort of mildly scary in the past, but this is the new direction. Only guns and violence. Exactly what the fans of the games want. Isn't it wonderful how Anderson knows to treat the fans with so much respect? Not. Well, to his defense, at that time the games weren't any different than this, so it was bearable and even sorta mildly surprising that it features a few minimal aspects of the fifth game (majini, the scarab devices, the Axeman) even when they are used without giving a meaning to them. Why question things logically in an Anderson film? It has no use. Anyways, the film at least has a minimal entertainment factor to it. What seems like a blatant rip-off of 'The Walking Dead' more and more becomes brainless fun with dozens of plot holes and character decisions, made by characters I couldn't care less about. Then there's the introduction of one of the finest characters of the original game, the actual protagonist: Chris 'The Boulder' Redfield. Well, at least he tries to be. To be honest, his introduction was not only extremely unsatisfying, he's totally underused as well. Furthermore, casting Wentworth Miller as the charismatic leader was a terrible choice. First of all, he doesn't look like Redfield in the slightest, secondly, he's also completely misinterpreted. The guy who played Carlos in the previous films looked and acted more like Chris than Miller does. On top of that, it occurred to me that he isn't even much of a great actor either. Honestly, I've seen him in a handful of different roles and he always plays this seemingly emotionless yet cool guy with one facial expression who seems to know more than he admits. He's charismatic, indeed, but he didn't do my boy Chris justice. Seriously, it doesn't arise out of nowhere that I had the strange feeling that he literally just played Michael Schofield rather than the original game's protagonist. From there on, the film offers one overstated action sequences after another, until the final confrontation. If there's one thing this film totally nailed, it's the characterization of iconic arch enemy Albert Wesker. Despite him being way too weak and not that much of a threat, it was a surprise to actually see a character who looks and acts exactly like his game counterpart. In the end though, when the film finally concluded (after a decent fight between the Redfields and Wesker) and the credits rolled I again had the feeling that it was only the beginning of the film, as it, to this point, didn't offer anything interesting, just repetitive action sequence after action sequence combined with cheesy dialogue. It's a strangely admirable ability to stretch so little substance to an one and a half hour film and it takes a lot of audacity to call it a full length feature and decent video game adaptation. Cheap fun factor put aside, that's nothing but outrageous. Yet, Anderson manages to always get away with it. Sigh. All in all, this installment is still dreadful as cinematic achievement or as a decent adaptation, but at least brought back the cheap entertainment factor that was nonexistent in the previous movie. It's all style and no substance and keeps on disgracing its source material in the favour of absolutely brainless action and nonsensical violence. I've finally given up on getting a proper adaptation. Also, someone please keep Paul W.S. Anderson from making any more movies. Please.",5,0,3,14 April 2020
A Star Is Born," The tragic side of superstardom
","'A Star Is Born' is a 2018 musical drama directed by Bradley Cooper starring him and Lady Gaga in the leading roles. Exactly one year ago, I was watching this film with my then girlfriend and was absolutely impressed by it. Not only played it a key role in my relationship, it's even my favourite movie of 2018. And after rewatching it, my personal opinion is even more confirmed. Coopers directorial debut is a flat out masterpiece. It might be the third remake of a story as old as time, but he excellently managed to put it in the modern times. It's a love story with music in it's blood, not only this, it tackles even more important themes: drug and alcohol addiction, the importance of never losing oneself and especially, the shadow side of fame. It's a perfect portrait of a musician dealing with his demons and declining fame and the rise of a promising talent all the same. Both parts are outstandingly played by their respective actors, Cooper and Gaga, and it was a shame that neither of them won the academy award for their performance. They both acted with extreme passion (surprising: Gaga) and both showed their immense musicality (unexpected: Cooper). Furthermore, it's an amazing overview of how the modern music industry works. The character development of both Jack and Ally is absolutely well paced and tragically shows us how much success influences your personality. Next to this, the plot is written with such great empathy and it extremely effects the overall atmosphere. Also, this film has one of the greatest soundtracks of the recent years and, as it's usually not my habit, many of the songs are still in my playlist. As if that was not enough, the final act is even the most touching part of it all. The camera work and editing make it possible to capture the absolutely heartbreaking scenes and the overdose of emotions linked to them. It's absolutely devastating and sad, it hits you with such vehemence that it will leave you speechless after it. Honestly, I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried my eyes out, especially with this rewatch where I knew what's gonna happen, but this time I could understand how it all comes together. All in all, this drama is an outstanding masterpiece that manages to combine both a love story and drama to an absolute tragedy. With convincing and genuine performances and excellent writing it offers a critical look at superstardom and the interpretation of talent . One of the most heartbreaking dramas of the recent years and one of my favourites in general.",10,0,2,28 October 2019
Unbreakable," What if superheroes existed?
","'Unbreakable' is a 2000 mystery drama directed M. Night Shyamalan starring Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. The movie industry is currently dominated by superhero franchises from countless companies, Marvel and DC being the frontrunners in the comic adaptation business. They all produce film that depict pure visual greatness adapted from small issues, in most cases the classic fight of good and evil. Doesn't matter whose side the people are on, both heroes and villains have always been idols and icons for many generations in the past decades and we can't even imagine it will ever change, although we're all aware that they are obviously fictional characters from an obviously fictional universe that would never exist in our own reality. But what if? What if superheroes existed in reality? While films like 'Kick-Ass' approach this basically abstruse question in a more humorous way, this MNS film explores it with immense seriousness. With the same fascination I felt while watching 'Split' (who come?) I followed the characters in this mysteriously conceptualised thriller. In this film, the director once again show that he has a sure feeling concerning screenwriting. The film consists of extremely smart dialogues and was executed with ingenious camera work and I once again wondered how it was possible that he seems to have lost this gift in the following decade. Without leading the plot ad absurdum it intelligently unfolds the secrets of its protagonist David Dunn who gradually begins to match the superhero ideals. It's the immensely high love for detail that makes it so magnificent: from his profession as a security guard to a personal weakness he fulfills all of it in a realistic way. It's less a thriller and more of a carefully narrated essay on the possibility of supernatural humans in our society that even succeeds to adopt the colorful visuals of a comic book and combine it with the reality. Willis and Jackson both acted greatly in their third collaboration and really made their characters come to life. It could have been a masterpiece, but there's this one aspect about it that severely bothers me. The film had a perfectly paced build up in terms of tension, but the last third of the film stays on the same continuous level. I knew that film would not last any longer and wondered if something more intense would happen, but no, we only got an plot twist that might have come unexpected, but in the end was an extremely underwhelming conclusion to an at this point brilliant film. It was simply too rushed and didn't do the rest of the film justice, it almost feels like Shyamalan ran out of ideas to creatively round up his own film and it's tremendously unsatisfying in the end. By all means, it's definitely not a terrible ending, but the director's style falsely lead the film's plot into a direction it would not even follow eventually. It's just the beginning of a conflict between good and evil, David Dunn vs Elijah Price and offers no further development afterwards. All in all, this thriller is an absolutely interesting and we'll crafted character study that never loses its serious tone, grips its audience and definitely is a welcome change in the superhero sub-genre, but could have been a masterful work if it wasn't for the undeniable logical but somewhat lazy final conclusion. It could have gone deeper into the character and their development, but ends it just like this instead. After having seen its unexpected successor, I'm absolutely stocked for the third installment of this trilogy and hope it treats the other films with enough respect.",8,0,0,17 February 2020
Superbad," McLovin' it
","'Superbad' is a 2007 comedy directed by Greg Mottola starring Jonah Hill and Michael Cera. Now after the holidays and all the watches of both festive films and all the mammoth sized reviews about the Skywalker trilogy I decided to sit back and relax with a rewatch of one of my favourite comedies of all time. You know, every cinephile has certain films they don't simply cherish, some films convey a specific feeling of comfort and some just feel like a second home. This is the case for me with this classic high school comedy. Unlike other takes on the genre, Superbad has always been standing out with its hilariousness. Of course the humour is not everyone's taste and it is way too vulgar and perverse, but it's not only this, it's greatly combined with a dramatic conflict of two childhood friends suffering from separation anxiety. It's perfectly balanced between both extremely funny jokes and heart-wrenching drama. All of this comes to life by the genuine chemistry between the two leading boys, but let's not underappreciate the contribution of the hilarious chaos cop duo of Bill Harder and Seth Rogen and the legendary and infamous McLovin played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse. The plot is well worded for a teenage comedy and shamelessly, but realistically deals with what hormone controlled teenagers are confronted in their daily lives. It has an impressive story structure and the way it all comes together is superb. All in all, this modern classic authentically showcases the chaotic adventure of three high school friends dealing with their desires and even their emotions towards their upcoming separation from each other. It's nasty, perverse and extremely hilarious, but all the while shows it has heart and doesn't only stay on the surface. A super good gem I like to revisit at least once a year and highly recommend to everyone who wants to feel like 17 again. Anyways, I'm McLovin it.",9,3,4,29 December 2019
The Others," Twisted and uniquely scary
","'The Others' is a 2001 mystery horror thriller directed by Alejandro Amenábar starring Nicole Kidman and Christopher Ecclestone. From time to time, I like to revisit some films with an either complicated or twisted story to see if it's even more well constructed than before. One of those titles is definitely this one. Roughly one year ago, I already gave it a spin at a film party and was blown away by it afterwards. With the knowledge of what would happen, this rewatch revealed even more of its subtle brilliance. First of all, the overall style is absolutely well elaborated. An old English mansion, seemingly neverending fog and authentic costumes make this film so tremendously atmospheric, but all of this would be in vain, if it wasn't for the general cinematography. It's the reason the film is so moody in the first place. The contrast between night and day, light and darkness make it come to life so easily. Without it, the film would be much less entertaining. Another factor the film would not work without is the central performance by Australian beauty Nicole Kidman. Not only does she nail the British accent decently, the way she leads the viewer through the subtle horror makes it so genuinely breathtaking. That's where we come to another point: Amenábar's screenplay. It creates such a creepy atmosphere although ... nothing really happens? To be honest, yes. Aside from some one or two scenes, the film completely passes on using graphic effects. There's no monster in this film, no terrifying entity that will haunt you in your dreams afterwards. It instead relies on mild scares and one might think 'Isn't that film terribly boring then?'. Surprisingly, the total opposite. The film takes place in your head and doesn't resolve what it's dealing with until the very end of the film, but before it reaches the shocking final conclusion there's Kidman who's singlehandedly in charge of creeping out the audience. It's her reactions, her terrified facial expressions that put the viewer in the same position as her and it's this helplessness that also effects the audience that make it so genuinely bone chilling. It's anything but your average ghost story with an obvious threat to escape from, because this threat in here isn't obviously definable. I guess that was what many people back in the day expected to see and why it's fairly underrated by several. It never intended to live from its graphic effects, Amenábar always wanted to terrify the audience just by his phenomenal screenplay. Speaking of which, it's even more brilliant upon a rewatch. Knowing about the mind blowing double plot twist in the end, I realized how it points out countless small hints over the course of the film that actually blatantly give away the ending. It's obvious and subtle at the same time and when it comes to a scene where it should be absolutely clear what really happened, it adds a small detail that makes it ambiguous. It gives the viewer so much information, both true and misleading, but it always makes so much sense nevertheless. This doesn't only happen once, it happens in every single case. I knew that it worked, because my brother who's never seen it before and didn't know about it was genuinely devastated by the ending while I sat there and was like 'Oh, he probably has a clue now' a number of times. But he didn't. Another stylistic device of it is the subliminal juxtaposition of religion and atheism, as it at the same time denies and confirms the existence of God. All in all, this intelligently written film is an underrated gem that knows to frighten you without being too graphic. The main reason this film disappointed the expectations of so many is probably how it was advertised, as it is a mystery thriller with horror elements rather than a horror film with thriller elements. But if you're able to put aside those false expectations you're in for a minimalistic but definitely frightening flick that builds up its tension with a spooky scenery and by playing mind games with you. It's psychological thriller in its best form that only uses the supernatural to lead you astray. An underappreciated and well crafted gem.",9,1,1,10 April 2020
Brokeback Mountain," More than just 'that gay cowboy film'
","'Brokeback Mountain' is a 2005 drama directed by Ang Lee starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. For my second extracurricular contribution to the 'Queering Cinema' community project, I decided to tackle one of the most critically acclaimed dramas from the oughts of this century. Allegedly, the director who has previously been known to me as the director of the visually stunning drama 'Life of Pi' but also the disastrous comic book adaptation 'Hulk' has created his opus magnum with this motion picture, hence my expectations to it remained neutral, even if I was a little euphoric as well, because of the phenomenal actors and actresses that star in it. Even if a star-studded doesn't automatically guarantee a fine film (history has proven it multiple times), I was sure to experience some excellence. Aside from Gyllenhaal, who famously happens to be my favourite actor, there is the legendary Heath Ledger starring opposite him, as well as a young Michelle Williams, who happens to be my favourite actress, and even Anne Hathaway in a smaller role. Regarding acting talent, this film is redundant with people who are capable of writing cinematic history. As it turns out, this is exactly what they did. Lee created a remarkable and multifarious drama that hits deep with everything it has to offer. Beforehand, I thought that the runtime of a little more than two hours could be too long, but ultimately turns out to be the appropriate amount of time to unfold the tragic romance between two shepherds. The film starts out rather slowly and takes a lot of time to introduce the leading characters, but at the same time feels oddly rushed. Most of the scenes in the beginning have zero to no dialogue and live from the visually stunning aesthetics of the mountains, storms and sheep flock and the relationship between Ennis and Jack develops in an extremely subliminal way. Avowedly, that both all suddenly have sex after in fact not much has happened between them appeared strange to me at first but makes a lot of sense retrospectively. As previously mentioned, the tension is built up subtly and isn't palpable straight away and hides in seemingly insignificant details. Also, it was all done intentionally to present the audience with a fait accompli, for they are confused about the whole situation themselves. Confusion is a pivotal theme in this film and influences the whole narration. Many things deliberately remain uncertain and the audience is left in the dark with most matters and must join the dots themselves. The by far biggest and most interesting mystery is what it is what they share. If I remember it correctly, the words 'gay' and 'homosexual' or other variants are not mentioned once, and it is left up to the audience to evaluate the relationship of the two protagonists. Are they homosexual, are they bisexual or was all just an illusion that resulted from isolation of being in the mountains? Whatever they have experienced remains unclear, as they both still seem to be attracted to their wives and also other girls, but fact is that those two human beings fell in love with each other despite their inability to express their true intentions and feelings. That's what makes this story so terribly tragic. The whole narration covers a time span of more than twenty years and the way they try to secretly relive their special romance they had in the early sixties. While the film was little fast paced in the beginning and could have taken a little more time to invest in depicting the heartache they feel when they are apart, it is still enough to make it appear so extremely unpleasant. It is nothing short of painful to see how those two men who share a deep bond must conceal their feelings, as homosexuality was not only frowned upon but also a matter that would have deprived them from any social status. Therefore, they continue living their lives without letting their true desire get in their ways, the only opportunity to meet each other is by one-night stands disguised as fishing and hunting trips. They even discuss their ideas of how it would be possible to settle down together, they have concrete plans of how to accomplish it, but ultimately Ennis fears the reaction of the society they live in. As if that hasn't been already heartbreaking enough, Lee ups the ante and makes it even more unbearable in the final act. After Jack all suddenly dies under strange circumstances, if he really died in a car accident or was killed by a group of homophobes, as Ennis imagines it, is not in fact mentioned, the film reached its emotional climax. Whatever has happened to him, fact is he is dead. How Ennis tries to cope with it in the final twenty minutes must be one of the most devastating sequences in history of drama. What makes it so utterly terrible is that they had so many chances, so many opportunities that could have prevented this tragic fate, but in the end, they never dared to seize them. All of this already sounds tremendously saddening, but it is the actors that breathe life into tragedy. Aside from a magnificent supporting role by my acting heroine Williams who masters the character of the fragile and subtly depressed wife wonderfully (another reason for me to love her), the chemistry between Ledger and Gyllenhaal is terrifically genuine and they play their respective roles convincingly. Also, their characters are both wonderfully developed and make this whole romance appear so realistic. Gyllenhaal is the more determined one, while Ledger portrays the more hesitant lover. Fact is, both manage to make it appear as if they are in love with each other in their own irresolute way and you can literally feel the way they express their desire for one another. While Ennis is taciturn throughout and leaves the talking up to Jack, it is the total opposite in the third act. They both have delivered already touching performances by then, but I swear to God, this final scene where Ennis stands in front of the wardrobe and looks at that blood-smeared shirt his beloved has kept over the years and realizes that he should have done so many things differently and breaks out in tears, is one of the most heartbreaking and devastating scenes I have ever seen. Seriously, I sobbed due to this emotional intensity. That his daughter told him that she is gonna get married with someone she barely knows but deeply loves no matter what reminds him of the chances he didn't seize. In this final shot it is all coming together, fear, regret and desire, and the combination of all those haunting feelings even makes the principally barely emotional Ennis Del Mar weep bitterly - and this is masterful acting and story telling. All in all, this star-studded drama is a highly emotional and hauntingly tragic ride into the deepest depths of human desire. It explores the strange love of two men who can not really tell how they feel about each other in an extremely sensitive way and comes to life by the outstanding performances of the lead actors who guide the viewer through this ambiguous and heartbreaking story. This film is without a doubt one of the best dramas of the decades and despite some pacing issues in the beginning, manages to be a breathtakingly tragic tale that sticks with the audience for a while. This film ends exactly as the two protagonists promise it to each other: What happens in Brokeback Mountain, stays in Brokeback Mountain. It is the devastating but unalterable truth behind it all. A gut-wrenching classic and extremely important entry in the landscape of LGBTQ films.",9,0,1,10 June 2020
Resident Evil: Extinction," Pointless, meaningless and painfully unentertaining
","'Resident Evil: Extinction' is a 2007 action horror film and video game adaptation directed by Russell Mulcahy starring Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. After the previous film has been a terrible but still enjoyable fun flick I felt that I was more and more able to appreciate the extreme low quality of those films and even sort of made my peace with this wannabe horror franchise. I was even excited to find out what would happen next. My naïve enthusiasm was punished by this absolutely terrible next entry. First of all, there's basically no reasonable connection to 'Apocalypse', but seriously pretends there is one. It states that the virus was able to spread around the globe and somehow even managed to dry out the whole planet. How the hell did that happen? It's just sad that it happened, but not how it happened. All of the sudden, the whole quest of containing the virus and the total annihilation of Raccoon City that was the main focus of the second film was made irrelevant. With not even the slightest touch of logic the film now depicts a post apocalyptic scenario in which Mel Gibson easily could have appeared. This outing now has lost any connection to any of the games and tries to survive on its own. To be honest, it could have been genuinely interesting and surprisingly entertaining, but having Paul W.S. Anderson as a screenwriter was again a fatal mistake. His screenplay is once again a paramount example for absolutely horrendous writing. He totally screwed up an interesting starting point and made absolutely nothing out of it. The film is basically two simple ideas (convoy of survivers and villains trying to make a clone of Alice) and stretched those to an one and a half hour feature film that offers nothing interesting at all. Before something useful actually happened the film offered scene after scene that was indeed stylish (I look at you, third repetitive zombie dog fight), but absolutely pointless in terms of plot development. That's the film's most massive problem: Pointlessness. Except for a handful of actually logic scenes the whole film is sheer stupidity and just doesn't bring any useful development. It's utterly stupid and simply not entertaining. It wastes most of its runtime by following the convoy and shows how it goes on and goes on, all the while failing to include any form of danger or tension. The crow attack? It was clear that they would survive that and was unrealistic harmless to the characters. Speaking of characters: Not only are the whereabouts of Jill Valentine completly unknown nor in any way questioned, all of the sudden and without any particular introduction Claire Redfield is there and in charge of everything. I literally paused the film to check if I accidentally left out a film, but it was all in best order. She was just there and Carlos and L.J. (who were both killed of disrespectfully in the process) and somehow Alice had to be there to. Surprisingly, Jovovich was not even as charismatic as before. With some new characters introduced and familiar faces reintroduced, the film then continues and ... offers nothing? I can't really explain, but no, it doesn't do anything about creating an atmosphere or a simplest form of suspense or action. As I said, the whole plot is pointless as hell. After more than an hour of nothingness (and useless shot of that one freaking sattlelite) the totally boring convoy arrives at the Umbrella facility and ... just flies off to Alaska without Alice? Yes and like it's no big deal. What is the point of letting the audience follow the fate of a group of irrelevant survivers just to have them escape easily and without any effort? It's so dumb. I almost fell asleep a number of times, because nothing happened that had me on the edge of my seat. Not even the obviously improved gore and makeup effects could do anything about it, as they were only used meaninglessly. Also, how many zombies do they want to fit in this one tiny box? It's tremendously unrealistic and just stupid. The final act doesn't change anything about it. Dr. Isaac's mutation is not only totally boring and the CGI nothing than awful, on top of that he doesn't pose as a threat or something. In the end, we get an absolutely dull and way too short and easily ended final fight and another extraordinarily bonkers setup for the next installment. Then the credits rolled and left me there after having experience nothing special. I was like 'That's all? That's actually all?' and already forgot what this film has presented. All in all, this outing is without a doubt the worst of the series so far and doesn't offer anything in terms of plot development. It totally mistreats all the characters and loses itself in stylish but eternally pointless scenes that are solely there to showcase the updated gore effects. Any form of story? Nonexistent. Any suspense or tension? Extinct. Any meaning for the series? Missing. What am I to say? It's totally irrelevant for the franchise, doesn't lead to anything and is nothing short of a brain melting snoozefest. Anderson has unexpectedly undercut himself again. Having seen this film leaves me deeply wondering how anyone read that dreadful screenplay and thought it would make a great film. I'm also wondering how Anderson is still allowed to work in Hollywood after creating one disaster after another. He's by far one of the most untalented writer-director I have ever seen. I don't know what to expect from the next films anymore, because this film was indescribably pointless, meaningless and on top of that, painfully unentertaining. It's no fun and absolutely forgettable. It has to mean something when the most exciting part of watching this film is when I choked on my beer while watching it. Just terrible.",3,0,4,13 April 2020
Silent Hill," Ambitious yet heavily flawed adaptation
","'Silent Hill' is a 2006 horror film and video game adaptation directed by Christophe Gans starring Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean. After not having watched a film yesterday and posting a faux review I decided on kicking of my birth month with a rewatch of what many deem to be the best video game adaptation. Given that this film is far away from being a masterpiece and is still a mediocre film doesn't really say much positive about this apparently cursed sub-genre. I actually have mixed feelings about it. First of all, I played the original PlayStation game and consider it to be an extremely chilling experience even it just rode on the coattails of the 'Resident Evil' game franchise, which I personally adore (but still have to check out the reportedly terrible film adaptations though). Anyways, I expected an equally nightmarish film, but as I said, mixed feelings. The film obviously altered the main premise and has thrown together countless elements into what appears to be a mish-mash of all the original games. That's where the mess begins. While it was Harry Mason solely looking for his daughter Cheryl in the abandoned town of Silent Hill and uncovers one shocking truth after another, it's now Rose Da Silva looking for her daughter Sharon. Similar plot, other people. It's such a pity, as I thought that Bean would make a great life action Harry Mason, only to find out that he played an all new and on the other hand useless background character. The film rather establishes a philosophy about maternal bonds and how important this relationship is, what is anything but terrible and not even that disastrous, but I'm generally not a fan of extreme changes when it come to adapting a source material appropriately. The story of the film may of course vary, but at least keep the same protagonists I connected to while playing the game in the first place. Is this too much asked for? While the film doesn't ensure this, they at least did something else properly: The optics. The overall ash covered scenery and burned and abandoned buildings, as well as the nightmare sequences of the other world are definitely some important advantage this film has to offer. I mean, they even nailed this one famous shot and the general camera work isn't nothing to sneeze at either, the same applying to the fitting score, but if there's one thing that bugs me about the visuals it's the usage of effects. Some practical effects and CGI effects were decent, but well, some seemed to have come straight out of a PS1 game and I'm pretty sure that didn't happen intentionally. They fulfilled their use to a certain degree, but considering it's a mid 2000s film it's pretty cheap to see it done only like this. Now about that plot. Oh boy, what an enjoyable mess. It sloppily combines the best elements the original franchise has to offer and makes an abomination out of it. The first half follows the story of the original game step by step and slowly begins to establish a similar atmosphere, but as soon as other people enter the scene and the film focusses on the cult theme the film stopped being scary. The cult might have been used in the game as well, I know that, but what made it so chilling was how it was only subtly used. Seriously, from there on it might be gross or shocking, but it's far from the eerie and emotional hellride the original game used to be. The game sent you on a psychological and melancholic journey, your only friend being a radio and a crowbar - a lonely man on the search for his daughter. No other people, except for one or two faces. The change of focus therefore basically steals the whole vehemence of the film and is anything but scary. No, really. It didn't scare me anymore. What's even more frustrating is how it implies some of the games finest features (the radio/mobile phone that signifies an upcoming threat, the siren etc.), but leaves it underused eventually. The most immense disappointment is the appearance of The Pyramid Head. He's only there for commercial reasons, at most an excuse for the producers that they have included one of the fan favourite villains. Sadly, he's totally irrelevant for the plot, the characters and doesn't do much at all. He's the personal demon of James Sunderland. What role does he play here? Sigh. Oh, now that we're speaking of uselessness: The male characters and the Christopher sub plot are also not adding anything important to the story and are absolutely unnecessary. Almost seems like they were written into the movie just to have male actors featured ... wait, they were? Yes, indeed and that's another thing that made me facepalm. Without or without them, the story continues on the same mediocre level and doesn't really add something overly exciting. In the end, it only reveals all the secrets and explains the whole story in a single scene and shows of some gory but not scary effects. Oh, and don't get me started about that senseless ambiguous ending. All of this is so frustrating to witness, because it's far from what the original stayed for. Back then it became such a success for it's strange atmosphere, emotional depth, nightmarish visuals and deliberately unexplained and confusing plot. Some hints are given away from time to time, but it's never meant to be fully understood, because Silent Hill is a personal and subjective hell. It's extremely depressing, creepy and absolutely melancholic. What does this movie do? It offers a half-heartedly produced mishmash of generic genre tropes and labels it Silent Hill. All in all, this film is a heavily flawed adaptation that had so many chances to become this infernal journey, but ends up as nothing but an entertaining yet cheap mess with dozens of plot holes. It might be shocking at times and has at least a decent atmosphere, but it's so far away from being the devastating mystery the game is. It could have been if it had respected its source material more. A scarily wasted opportunity to become the greatest video game adaptation of all time ... wait, for a time it has been. Even with everything I stated before. Is it a great film? Absolutely no. Is it a perfect adaptation? Also no. Is it the closest to a decent game adaptation we can get? Sadly, I think so and it's still impossible for me to hate it nevertheless. That's where I give this film credit for: Mindless entertainment.",6,0,1,10 April 2020
"I, Tonya"," How media makes a monster
","'I, Tonya' is a 2017 biopic directed by Craig Gillespie starring Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan. The first film I've watched in this new decade is the infamous underdog story and fall of figure skater Tonya Harding. Before I've seen the movie I only had rudimentary knowledge about her and the famous incident that dominated the news twenty six years ago and lead to her lifetime ban of the sport. People to this day have different views on the actual happenings and of how much she was actually involved. In the opening title it's stated that this film is based on the paradoxical interviews of the participants. This information is prominently used in the narrative structure. When I was watching it, I slowly began to notice that several scenes contradicted others and it had some continuity errors or unbelievable events. The ingenious thing about it though is how it was all done on purpose to perfectly mirror the structure of said interviews. I've never seen something like this before and it really amused me. Furthermore, after seeing the original footage in the end credits I was actually blown away by how brilliantly the actors were chosen for their respective roles. The accuracy of how the actors look compared to their real-life counterparts is eerily high. Not only the outer appearance was done right, also the acting as their characters. Margot Robbie delivered her most powerful performance as of today and definitely should have won the Academy Award for best actress (if it wasn't for the magnificent Frances McDormand in 'Three Billboards'). Also Allison Janney's transformation into LaVona Harding is scarily realistic and although she doesn't have that much screentime she dominates every single frame she's in. The interdependence of Robbie and Janney is simply stunning and shocking all the same. The tone of the film goes along greatly with the narrative and what I consider as precious, never judges one of the characters or mocks them in any way. Of course it has been a horrific tragedy and no one's not guilty in any way, but I think it treats everyone with fair respect in comparison to what the media did back in the day. Additionally, how the film is shot is just terrific as it has a lot of great shots, especially on the ice rink and in the slow motion scenes and a frantic editing style that captures the nasty attitude of the story. All in all, this brutal biopic showcases the infamous tragedy with enormous respect and contains both excellent performance and high quality writing and in comparison to what's the general belief gives Tonya Harding a whole new dimension to her as a person and the story that changed her life forever. I think it's great how it casts a new light on a not quite innocent but widely misunderstood woman and her life that has been mercilessly eviscerated by the media. I raise my hat to Gillespie to make this decision.",8,1,1,2 January 2020
Pan's Labyrinth," What exactly is the nightmare?
","'El Laberinto Del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth)' is a 2006 Spanish fantasy drama directed by Guillermo Del Toro starring Ivana Baquero and Sergi Lopez. After the recent watch of 'A Monster Calls' I thought it was time to rewatch one of the film's most obvious influences. What makes this watch so special is the simple fact that I experienced it in the original Spanish version, of course with subtitles. Cause you know, I don't speak Spanish at all, but I wanted to see it as original as possible.
In the past, a trio of Mexican directors have established themselves in modern Hollywood and are jokingly known as the 'Mexican Trinity' nowadays. Those directors are Alfonso Cuaron, Alejandro G. Innaritu and Guillermo Del Toro, all three are not only Academy Award winners, they also managed to make successful films in both English and their own mother language. In the case of Del Toro, his hugest success is this fantastic fantasy drama. As initially stated, I've already seen it roughly two years ago and it already amazed me back then. Now upon a rewatch, I see myself appreciating it even more. The director has put all blood, sweat and tears into this project and it's palpable in every single minute of runtime. He's created a nightmarish fairy tale that consists of countless small facets that make it so incredibly outstanding. What probably makes this film so legendary is simply how it looks. From start to finish it's absolutely picturesque and colorful, the visuals are nothing but stunning. On top of that, it doesn't only look incredible, it's at the same time ingeniously captured. DP Navarro did his best work in here and is one of the main reasons the film works out so well. But it's not only the superb style, it's also the story that makes it so uniquely precious. The Mexican mastermind has written and enacted a compelling and perfectly paced dark coming of age tale of a young girl during the Spanish war. In the course of this, he doesn't only manage to create realistic characters with complex personalities, he also succeeds to draw on a number of genres without letting it become a mess. What this film combines is nothing short of masterclass writing. On the core it's a packing history drama that elegantly weavers to together itself with fantasy and horror elements. Fairies and Fauns in a war drama? So strangely experimental. The Pale Man? Absolutely horrifying and iconic. As if that wasn't enough, the film even offers subtle social criticism with a juxtaposition of the war infected reality with the terrifying fantasy world, but it obviously comes to the conclusion that the reality is the true horror in this. While the CGI isn't quite the most outstanding (come on, it's no Hollywood blockbuster!), it still offers shockingly brutal make up effects that underline this statement. All in all, this film is hands down one of the most masterfully crafted feature films of all time. Not only does it have a breathtakingly beautiful story, it also has excellent acting performances a captivating plot and eerie visuals. It's a unique piece of art that combines countless aspects to sheer brilliance. Its overall tone end especially the ending might be sad, but it's never too depressing. The film effortlessly manages to hit you at the whole range of human emotions. Every director has a masterpiece and this is without a doubt Del Toro's magnum opus and probably one of the best Spanish films of all time. An absolutely beautiful dark fairy tale that anyone should have seen at least once.",10,0,0,27 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," What Star Wars has always been about...
","'Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise Of Skywalker' is a 2019 science fiction film directed by J.J. Abrams starring Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. Before I went to the cinema, I heard how many fans and critics complained about the last installment of the Skywalker saga. But the older I get, the more I understand that people complain even about the smallest things and it didn't demoralised me to make an opinion myself. Especially when it comes to Star Wars. The screening I attended perfectly mirrored who SW is actually made for: There were a lot of teenagers and twenty-somethings as well as elder generations present. Doesn't sound quite extraordinary, but what fascinated me was that all of them shared the same experience, we all watched ecstatically and I could see in their reactions that we all felt the same. I made no exception. The film is everything else but bad. It's tight and action packed and didn't lack any suspense. Of course it also had minor flaws, but they weren't as catastrophic as all other fans were stating. The fact that Rey is the granddaughter of Imperor Palpatine is undeniably random and comes out of thin air, but it's elaborated in the story and hence bearable. They should have reworked the opening titles of pure cringe, that's for sure. But things like these don't make a film a disaster. In the same manner of the other films it told a story about the balance of the force. It didn't try to achieve anything else. Even more, I think it's sad that J.J. Abrams tried to apologize for what Rian Johnson supposedly did wrong (what he didn't, in my humble opinion). Either way, there we have it again. What bugs me the most about the fans is the general hypocrisy: TLJ did something that was unusual for SW, TROS used the same old pattern and fans raged because the film offered to much fan service and didn't even try to show some originality. Apparently, whatever you do, someone will always complain. The most important thing of all is the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed this popcorn flick. I'm not so deep in this toxic fandom and as I already said about the previous installment, that's my biggest advantage. I sat in the cinema and had two and a half hours of a phenomenal time that made me feel like a child again. It's about fun and excitement, nothing else. If people can't sit back and simply relax, I'm sorry for that. I though, consider this as magical experience. It offered everything I asked for, because my expectations weren't so extremely high. Leia's death played a significant role, so did Ben Solo's sacrifice in the end. The most interesting character of the new trilogy, brilliantly played by one of my favourite newcomer actors, Adam Driver, got the perfect ending to his arc. He literally brought to an end what his grandfather Vader started. If he had survived it would not have made his character justice. I heard that many people criticised the 'force heal' thing that, admittedly, created a few continuity errors, but even that could be logically explained by simply stating that her ancestor is the most powerful Sith lord of all time. Just saying. Furthermore, it had enough epic moments, cool lightsaber battles and an atmosphere that a part deep inside of me has missed for so long. It all worked well for me, someone who basically criticises the smallest details in any film. This time I shut off my mind and simply enjoyed a decent flick. Iit didn't bother me at all. It doesn't matter what others say, the fact that she calls herself Rey Skywalker in the end after burying the lightsabers at the place where it all began was neither cheesy or undeserved, I consider it as a respectful gesture and a well done homage to the original trilogy. The same counts for the scene in which she talks to the Jedi of the past. Call me a madman, but I liked it a lot. All in all, the final entry of the Skywalker saga is a flawed but still well done farewell to a glorious story of iconic characters, with a reputation worse than it actually is. As I already stated, no one hates Star Wars more than a Star Wars fan. If you're open minded an wanna have a good time, ignore the hate of the 'fans', don't expect to much and you'll be rewarded with a great experience. I can see why people may not like it, but these are minor inconveniences that don't affect how great it is. It's not as dramatic as everyone says, in the end it's only a movie, made to entertain. Whether you like it or not, the force is strong with this trilogy that, honestly, is way better than the prequel trilogy. Since the first film premiered 42 years ago there have been people hating on it and it will never change. I'm glad that I can say that I find pleasure in all of them. No matter what others say, Star Wars films are watched with the heart and not with the mind. Remember that. If you hated it, it's okay, but please don't try to ruin it for the minority of people who actually enjoyed it. Thank you!",8,3,12,28 December 2019
Fargo," McDormand is a queen!
","'Fargo' is a 1996 (comedic) thriller (officially) directed by Joel Coen starring Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. I gotta admit that I've already watched it roughly one year ago when I had personal issues and was in a bad mood that resulted in a disability to like films in general and that I heavily disliked this film. Now that the worst of my personal problem is over and I'm able to appreciate everything again, I had the strange feeling that I didn't do this film justice and that I had to give it a rewatch and after finding this nice little Mediabook I knew I had to set things straight. Like I expected, this film is actually pretty good. There's so much to cherish in it and I still cannot believe that, as the opening titles state, all these depicted events are based on a true story. It's just insane. What appears to be another brilliant gathering of thoughts of the Coen brothers really happened in 1987. They took it and made it a brilliant comedic thriller. Yes, I say it's a comedic thriller, because overall it might be a thriller, but there too many scenes that feature crude humour that I couldn't leave that part out. Actually, it's undeniable that in it's cold core it's a black satirical crime flick. First of all, the way how the plot is constructed and links several storylines with weird, but original characters is simply superb. It's full of funny running gags, dialogue and it perfectly combines the right amount of abstruse humour and true earnestness. From the wannabe gangster duo, to a desperate car salesman in the need for cash to a pregnant, but still determined police chief there's not a single character that is boring in any way. This cold-blooded thriller features so many outstanding actors and actresses that made them come to life with such an easiness. Leading lady Frances McDormand (who only has had one hour of screentime to again proof that she's the greatest) delivered an ingenious performance as the protagonist police chief. She's such a sweet lady and she dominates every single scene she's in, also the way she speaks is just lovely. Definitely one of the greatest actresses in the business. But let's not forget to praise Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the quirky and evilly hilarious kidnappers and William H. Macy as the salesman who also knew to entertain with their weird charisma. Set in a scenery of frozen highways and endless widths of cold snow they all manage to create this unique atmosphere. Also, mostly enabled by the breathtaking cinematography of Roger Deakins. I could seriously feel the cold of the film crawling down my spine although I was sitting in my warm room under my even warmer blanket. It's so beautifully shot and moody that I still cannot understand why it took the Academy more than twenty years to award that man. He's a virtuoso with the camera! All in all, this shockingly beautiful and brutally bloody snow satire is an outstanding entry to the independent cinema, with an inimitable atmosphere and tense music and unbelievably real story lead by a magnificent McDormand. It took me another watch to appreciate this classic flick and feel redemption. Better late than never.",9,2,2,7 February 2020
Grease," Kitsch saved by extreme musicality
","'Grease' is a 1978 musical directed by Randal Kleiser starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. For I am some sort of musical actor myself (Ten Sing, anyone?), I from time to time love to see films that depict exactly what happens when my two greatest passions collide, and hence I have a weakness for titles of this generally derided subgenre. To this day, I cannot really understand why. What is so hilarious about when two of the greatest forms of art go hand in hand? Of course, it appears rather ridiculous when characters all suddenly sing and dance about their deepest desires, but that's the charm of this genre. No matter, how many people apparently dislike them, they are and have always been popular and successful works of art. One must only think about genre defining classic 'Singin' In The Rain', of which the titular song is still popular among school choirs (believe me, I speak from experience), or Damien Chazelle's masterful modern masterpiece 'La La Land', each generation has at least one iconic musical that defined it and of which the songs have been sung by each and everyone who has seen it at that time. When it comes to deciding what the ultimate box office hit of the seventies is, most people settle for this greasy romantic musical, but, as the past has proven it numerous time, does iconic necessarily mean it is of high quality? Well, I can comprehend the general attraction for this flick here, but for me there are too many things that keep me from declaring it grandiose. What grants this film most of its point is without a doubt the well-marked talent of its charismatic lead actors. Travolta and Newton-John are both truly gifted and I wonder if there is anything they can't do. His tenor and her soprano harmonize wonderfully when they sing together, but also in their solo songs they know to display their extreme musicality. As if that wasn't already enough, they also dance to it impressively and also do not forget about acting on an equally terrific level. This could have been enough if it wasn't for the major problems that the odd screenplay causes. Set in the carefree year of 1958, an archetypal greaser falls in love with an innocent Australian beauty over the summer and they live out their relationship like it was the last chance to ever experience love in their young lives, for they are aware that they'll probably never see each other again, but as chance would have it, they of course realize after the lovely vacation that they are now attending the same high school. Will they be able to rekindle their romance or will the flame stay out forever? This is the promising question that made me curious about this film in the first place, but in the end, it turns out that the plot depicted here is far away from being what it originally promised. In this love, peace and harmony kind of musical, invariably everyone is overacting, and sadly, it isn't the pleasant kind of overstated anymore. It is exaggerated to the certain degree where it becomes utterly annoying. There wasn't a single second of seriousness the film would have benefitted from immensely and I felt teased by it rather than entertained. While this effect is kept in reasonable limits in the case of our leading lovebirds, I felt provoked by the silliness of all the supporting characters. What amazes me the most about them, though, is how despite their unnecessarily high amount of screen time, I wasn't able to find a connection to them, nor did they become likeable in the slightest. Speaking of screen time, it was astonishing to see how Danny and Sandy barely share any time together and were pushed in the background in favour of elaborating the supporting characters. Seriously, I felt betrayed that the allegedly wonderful romance that was implied in the beginning isn't what the main focus lies on in this film. That's why it was extremely difficult to believe that they actually love one another. Aside from the fact that the conflict that the presence of his friends while flirting with Sandy bothers Zuko a lot isn't even thematized at all (by the way, they are always there and know that they date and none of them seems to have a problem with it except for him), the only development we get to see happening between them is a simple and dumb pattern. They argue, make up, argue, make up and argue and all the time Zuko behaves like the greatest jerk you will ever see. Not only does this make their so-called romance appear unconvincing, it also entails that there is zero chemistry between the two. For a couple that ostensibly spent the whole summer together in love, this is awfully inauthentic. Next to this, I am also not fully satisfied with the soundtrack. While iconic aestival anthem 'Summer Nights' made me have a blast (pun intended) and a few other songs were acceptably decent as well, the majority of the songs were either boring or pointless and contributed nothing of importance to the plot ('Beauty School Drop-Out' - what in the actual hell?). By the way, did I say plot? As funny as it sounds, despite its promising premise, there is barely one. The few sequences that happen throughout the film (the dance off, the car race etc.) are boring and only function as stupid joints to set up the next musical act. I am aware that it was originally a Broadway show conceptualised for a stage, but that doesn't entitle it to have an unexciting and pointless plot. As if that wasn't already enough, the ending is the two-step peak of all the previous nonsense. First, the fact that Zuko is only able to accept Sandy after she had an offscreen makeover and all suddenly turned into some sort of greaser chick, isn't only conveying the totally wrong message that women should change so that their moronic lovers are able to love them, it also deprives the whole romantic conflict of its credibility and dramatic potential. What ultimately gave me the rest was when they drove off into the sky ... Why? Just why? That was the exact moment I facepalmed and the film lost all seriousness for me. All in all, this iconic musical hits the right tones in terms of musicality and dancing, but is heavily off-key in terms of narration, plot and acting. It all appears to be some sort of unpleasant caricature with a dull story and annoying characters I couldn't find any form of connection with, everything is without rhyme or reason. On top of that, it is cheesy, corny and so overstuffed with ludicrous kitsch that it made me want to throw up most of the time. Grease is the word - and like any form of fat it might appear to be good for some, but deep inside we all know it is anything but healthy - and in this case it was definitely not good for me. If it wasn't for the musical achievement and the individual charisma of its leads, it would have been way worse. I even would buy the soundtrack, but the film as a whole? Nah. For now, it is borderline mediocre. Now I feel the need to wash my hair ... it feels ... greasy.",6,0,0,25 June 2020
Footloose," A necessary rebellion
","'Footloose' is a romantic drama directed by Herbert Ross starring Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer. The 1980s were the natal era of the subgenre of dance films as we know them today. Contrary to its parent genre of musicals, of which the dancing was a of course a crucial aspect as well, this one focussed less on the singing and the exaggerated depiction of its subject matter, and despite its odd gambolling, centred more around establishing more or less serious, light-hearted, mainstream oriented romances for the youth instead. While the prime example of this lucrative era was without a doubt Emile Ardolino's box office hit 'Dirty Dancing', there were two films prior to it that paved the way for it: 'Flashdance' and 'Footloose'. Both were released around the same time, and as I heard it from the majority, there even was some kind of war among fans, arguing which of the two is the better one. Supposedly, this in fact trivial subject resulted in the fans building two opposing camps. When I asked my parents about it, I knew that this myth was true, as my mother is in team 'Footloose', while my father considers himself an advocate of 'Flashdance'. That was the moment I knew that I had to explore this strange phenomenon myself, and when I by happenstance was able to obtain a copy of one of those infamous films, I had no other choice than giving both a watch. While I haven't had the chance so far to obtain the other, I was surprisingly pleased with the outcome of this 1984 flick. The basic premise of this film is how one young man from outside causes a revolution in a small town where the act of dancing has been legally prohibited. To be honest, at first, I considered it to be an absurd idea. In what sort of hicksville would something abstruse like that in fact occur? Where would it be actually realistic? The answer was a simple as astonishing: in a small town shaped by religious beliefs and values. What is shown in this film shocked me, as it wasn't just some rules laid down by some clerics, no, the members of the parish council in this film are best described as religious fanatics to me. The way they have imposed a curfew on their children, disallow them to listen to rock music, as they claim it to be the music of the devil (boy, I wonder what they would have said when Deathcore was already existing at that time), the way they outlaw the existence of dancing, ban the consumption of alcohol and drugs in any form, and even the reading of certain pieces of classic literature just made me angry while watching it. This is good old oppression of the personal development of teenagers, and not forgetting, methods used by Nazis in some way (who else burned books stating that it doesn't fit the general ideology?). From the start on, the film wants to establish a classic enemy image and characterizes the town's regime as the hostile that requires to be rebelled against, while Ren MacCormack, a shy yet talented boy new in town, is established as the saviour. I personally like this structure, as Kevin Bacon is really pleasant as the rebellious outsider and becomes the identification figure pretty quickly, someone who doesn't just take what he is said and fights for the freedom of himself and his fellow teenagers who haven't dared to disobey before he arrived. That is what I love this flick most for. The aspect of dancing functions only as a means to an end in this film and is only an exemplary expression of resistance against a system that doesn't want them to be what they want to be. Even if it isn't masterfully executed, I still acknowledge what it aims for. Even if the film tends to express an extremely biased opinion towards the parental generation, it also tries to explain their point of view and why they treat their children with this extraordinary strictness. Kept in perspective, it is still undeniably wrong to oppress children like this, but as it was mentioned that Reverend Moore (decently played by John Lithgow) initiated all this as the result of his own personal trauma after the untimely death of his own son, it took a lot of his apparent malevolence away and gave him a lot of humanity instead. Furthermore, his wife (portrayed by the lovely Diane Wiest) functions as the voice of reason for her vulnerable and overprotective husband and decreases the one-dimensionality even more. What is there worth criticising then? Well, even if the values it wants to convey are powerful and utterly important, the story at times didn't dare to go to the extremes, the conflict could have been more intense and the resistance on the part of the parents could have been more intensive. I mean, this uncouth young boy arrives at their town, starts a revolution and threatens to disturb the peace and destroy the system of oppression they tediously built up and they seemingly tolerate it just like that. Also, aside from Bacon's presentation in the abandoned factory, the montage of him teaching his buddy how to do dance correctly and the final scene at the senior prom, the film has literally no other scenes that involve dancing at all. For a film that revolves about this topic and makes it its primary focus, this lack appears quite inconvenient to me. Bacon and the rest of the cast are apparently extremely talented, no doubt whatsoever, but they just don't get enough time to present their skills, nor the opportunity to shine as they all deserve it to. No, the film has some undeniable flaws in terms of narration, but the thing that keeps me from disliking it, is how it represents the mindset of a whole generation that desired to express themselves and what they believed in, no matter what others say about them. Even if it is far away from being as masterful as the exact film, it is commemorative of counterculture classic 'Easy Rider', as both convey the ideas of their respective, by parents and the mainstream despised generation. All in all, this classic dance film might lack some narrative strength and a certain kind of conflict potential, but it is utterly entertaining, light-hearted and bares messages too important to ignore. The performances are acceptable, the dialogue isn't all cheesy and makes me feel good the whole time, nevertheless. It has got, heart, rhythm and a catch soundtrack. An essential, light-footed and uplifting drama that knows to be iconic and essential for a generation and knows to bust a move. No masterpiece, but a lovely film that is too enjoyable to be ignored. We'll see how well its direct opponent will do.",7,0,0,1 July 2020
Split," The predator and the prey
","'Split' is a 2016 thriller directed by M. Night Shyamalan starring James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy. It has been quiet around the infamous Indian-American director Shyamalan, who landed some surprise hits at the end of the millennium, such as 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and that granted him fame as a great Hollywood writer-director before creating one flop after another (there are countless, but remember 'The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth') in the following fifteen years or something. People believed he simply forgot to make decent films and that he would never really make it to the big screen again. That's why nobody really expected it that he would come back roaring with a banger like this feature. There's almost nothing about it that's worth criticising. James McAvoy hands down delivered a masterful performance that has never existed like this before. The way he portrays six different personalities, switching within minutes is just mental. It really gave me the feeling that I was spectating six different actors and had to remind myself multiple times that it's just this one Scottish genius. He definitely steals the show from everyone else involved, but Taylor-Joy gave a brilliant performance as well. The way she presented her shyness was somewhat sweet and how she showed both restraint and yet acted actively in every situation was superb and an proof of how versatile her acting range actually is. Both protagonists showed extreme raw emotions that fit well into the tense atmosphere. Furthermore, the story was intelligent and extremely interesting as it has created a character that has so much potential to become iconic. I was sitting there with unmeasurable fascination for this insane lunatic and followed every second in awe. I think it's also notable how the story combines an original and ingenious idea with a subliminal reminder that mental illness and trauma are problems in our society. Also, how the film combines metaphors (long hallways with cables and pipes) and visual symbolism (most shots are literally split in half and extremely dark!) was genuinely exciting. Additionally, the Predator-And-Prey allegory gave it an extremely sad undertone that gave both characters a whole new dimension to them and actually made me feel bad not only for Casey, but also for Kevin. Until the end I couldn't tell what is going to happen next and this made it so horrifyingly packing. It's also and advantage that the violence in this flick is not all too graphic and mostly takes place in the viewer's head. All in all, I'd say that MNS celebrated a magnificent comeback with this crazy thriller that should've granted McAvoy at least one Oscar nom. I'm actually stoked for the apparent prequel and the badly received sequel. To this point, I'd say that the director is back and that deservedly. Hopefully, he doesn't destroy what he has built up with this...",9,0,1,3 February 2020
We're the Millers," One of the funniest (not best) comedies of the recent years
","'We're The Millers' is a 2013 comedy directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber starring Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston. I don't know about you, but I'm someone who watches movies according to the weather outside. I really can't explain that phenomenon, but the weather condition is always a main influence of my movie of choice. It's just that some films just feel way much better when the temperature in reality fits. If it's cold as hell outside and snow is everywhere there's an almost one hundred percent chance I'll be watching 'The Shining', the other way around, when the sun is mercilessly melting the world to the ground you'll be finding me watching 'Predator' and sweating with the characters. What I'm trying to say, this watch was inspired by the awesome weather and my tendency to revisit one of the hottest films of when I was in eighth grade. Funnily, we even watched this film in class once and back then I of course loved it. Honestly, the film doesn't fail to entertain me even as of today. Given the fact that it was made by the director of 'Dodgeball', one of my favourite comedies growing up, it was probably was the reason it appeals so much to me. But not solely this. The film basically lives from it's sarcastic humour any the absolutely genuine chemistry of the protagonist faux family. Not only is Aniston showing how undeniably hot she is, also her Rachel-Green-with-more-cuss-words kind of acting is also a key factor this film works out so well. But Sudeikis is also delivering decently, Roberts is convincing and Poulter is awkwardly loveable as hell. I definitely cannot deny that I liked the characters immediately and really rooted for them all the time. Well, while the characters are undoubtedly entertaining it's undeniable that the story itself is absolutely generic. Enjoyable but yet absolutely generic. Drug dealer gone smuggler creates a fake family and tries to bring drugs from México to the USA. Most of it happens in the very beginning and then carries itself from trailer park to trailer park. It definitely isn't much, but fun to watch nevertheless. Most of the jokes work though and as already said, the general crude and at times even dark humour was absolutely fine with me, even when there were even a few scenes that created an uncomfortable sort of awkward tension. The idea with the weed baby? Argh. The other family talking about everything no-one wants to know about? I know that it's supposed to ridicule this concept, but it was more cringe worthy than actual hilarious. But that didn't stop me from having a good time. I loved how the characters developed and began to have actual feelings for each other and it was nothing short of heartwarming to see them having a happy end. All in all, this film is definitely not a comedic masterpiece, but it's a decent watch with absolutely loveable characters, enough naughty jokes and hilarious lines and definitely a pleasure to watch. The best thing is that this road trip makes me feel good. It's just a mindless fun to shut your brain off to. Nothing else did I expect to get from it. Oh, and I'm not gonna deny that I was sorta jealous of Poulter that he got to make out with both his female costars. But that's another story.",7,1,2,10 April 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man," Obligation over choice
","'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a 2012 comic book adaptation directed by Marc Webb starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. As many of my longtime followers may know, the annual rewatch of this flick is part of my Valentine's Day tradition. 'Why exactly this one?' some of you may ask legitimately. I'll tell you. I started this ritual when I was around thirteen years old and this film was one of my all time favourites. So, I said to myself, you either gonna have a date on the day of love or watch Spider-Man instead. What am I to say? For the past several years it has always been the adventure of the arachnid avenger and I gave this old DVD more spins than any spintop I have ever owned. Cupid hasn't been the best shooter in my case, so that's the way it is. First of all, I wanna make it clear that my personal taste in cinema has absolutely changed since then and that this film definitely isn't one of the greatest ever. You know, it's still not bad though. As someone born around the new millennium, I happen to have grown up with every single interpretation of the most famous web slinger. Maguire was the man during my childhood years, Garfield was there when I was in my early teen years and Holland is there now that I have reached maturity (at least, by law). So, I can actually enjoy every adaptation of the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. I gotta admit though that I now realize some definite flaws. The most indisputable problem of this flick is that it's obviously spinning it's web around the foundation of the Raimi trilogy instead of building something original in the first place. There are countless stories in the comic books it could have adapted in a way never seen before, but it rather insisted on following the same pattern and sometimes using the same scenes with only mildly changed dialogue. This is where it really shows that it's a reboot rather than an all new adaptation. Aside from these decisions that were probably mostly made by Avi Arad, the director Marc Webb who was literally born for this job (at least, by name) did decent work. He managed well to direct a magnificent cast that consists of academy award winners and nominees. Even though Garfield and Stone are slightly too old to portray high school teenagers (this has always been a problem for the casting directors when it comes to casting them) they still looked wonderful in their respective roles and, in the case of the first, acted superbly in the context of the format. Also, I'd like to point out the atmospheric score of James Horner that is hands down the best aspect of this flick. The screenplay shows both greatness and debacles. First, it's cool that they finally brought The Lizard to the big screen with actually impressive CGI. I've never seen a Lizard speaking with such a prominent English accent before, so that's an achievement. Second, the chemistry between the protagonists is so lovely and some scenes had surprisingly well written dialogue (the dinner discussion!) and the new style of the suit is amazing (pun intended) too. So is the action in the fight sequences that finally contain new camera angles and shots that use the power of swinging for the first time. This innovation is apparently ignored by the most and definitely needs to be appreciated more! Well, but let's get to the negative aspects as well: The film is basically too long with a runtime of more than two hours while one third consists of the origin story that we've all been knowing about and that was at times recreated scene by scene from Raimi's features. Also, the whole 'responsibility' aspect was altered into something less inspiring and only used as a side theme that never fully reached its whole potential in the story. Additionally, what's the point of building up this whole 'obligation over choice' symbolism only to destroy and negate it with the last lines? It's undeniably a dumb decision, even if it means that Gwen and Peter can become a couple in the obviously set up sequel. Oh, the immense disrespect to Captain Stacy whose last wish was that his daughter would be left out of it ... Well, we all know how that ends eventually. All in all, this extended Sony advertisment in a Marvel adaptation is a decent fun nevertheless. I'm probably a bit biased, but not that much. It's nice mindless fun for in between and although it's not remembered or appreciated in the pop culture, definitely played a significant role in the history of the hero's films. It's highly influenced by Sam Raimi and suffers from the lack of originality, but remains a childhood pleasure. I'm not sure if I'm gonna revisit it ever again. Let's hope I have a date on Valentine's Day next year. Otherwise, you all know where I'm gonna swing by.",6,1,2,14 February 2020
Resident Evil," Borderline blasphemy to the original game
","'Resident Evil' is a 2002 horror film and video game adaptation directed by Paul W.S. Anderson starring Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez. As I previously expressed, my love for the video game franchise and all of its titles is endless. They accompanied me through high school and even as of today, I routinely play them as if it was the first time. I can never escape the packing atmosphere and the unique feeling that it never fails to create in me. While I adore the original games, I've always kept myself from watching the movies, as I heard they are nothing like the games. But now that I made my way through the 'Silent Hill' adaptations, I thought it was long overdue to survive those films as well. I really wasn't expecting much, but what this movie offered was a huge disappointment even for that standard.
First of all, it's totally obvious that this film absolutely distanced itself from the source material. It's more than heavily adapted, it's something that's at last loosely connected with the iconic franchise. I knew about that. But what was this supposed to be? Neither does any of the beloved main characters appear in here, the whole premise has been extremely altered. Instead it follows a group of soldiers on the mission to contain the virus, with Milla Jovovich's character Alice (as only mentioned in the credits) as the protagonist. Many things from the game are name-dropped and only mentioned by the way and no part of the actual story. Even if this tries to be something on its own, it's still nothing but only just mediocre as a horror film. Director Anderson who's responsible for the infamously trashy gem 'Mortal Kombat' tries to bring his own vision to the big screen, but fails to achieve anything I'd consider notable. After watching this film, I additionally watched a short documentary segment in which he explains his actions. In a nutshell, the man is a total hypocrite. He states that he'd absolutely love the game and always wanted to make it come to life and describes his admiration for the atmosphere, the characters and the specific kind of horror it created. Then why didn't he include any of those aspects? What did he do instead? In his own words, something that functions as some sort of prequel to the game. And I was even more confused. Funnily, he was confident enough to claim that he treated the source material with immense respect. What he just didn't. He simply did not. The plot is a total mess with less than a handful of scenes that I liked. Nothing else. Except from famously cheesy dialogue and one-liners, it didn't do anything about creating some similar sort of atmosphere. It's nonexistent. While I see some kind of silver lining in the not quite brilliant yet charismatic performance by Jovovich, how she roundhouse kicks the zombie hound and how the side characters die in the laser beam sequence, it's still nothing overall satisfying or entertaining. Don't even get me started about those horrible visual effects that are so bad my running gag of comparing it to PS2 graphics wouldn't make any sense in this case. Not even the zombie makeup looks scary in any way. I've seen countless film way older than this one which nailed to have frightening make up, so there's no excuse for it that they are so dull like this. They're worse. It's an imprudent and catastrophic mess that dares to call itself 'Resident Evil'. All in all, it's an absolutely terrible adaptation, but a mediocre action horror film that just didn't make anything on its own, although it's obviously intended. Despite declaring himself a huge fan of the franchise, director Anderson was without a doubt too incompetent to realize a decent life action adaptation of his allegedly favourite game. He completely misunderstood the source material and failed to capture its quintessential features. To be honest, given what he made here, it feels like he's never ever played any of the games. He wanted to make something original, but there's a difference between creating something from a fan favourite source material and insultingly using its huge success to half-heartedly produce a totally estranged flick that people hoped would be anything like their favourite horror experience. Not really surprising that he never achieved to make something outstanding. Aside from this, it would be more bearable if it wasn't named 'Resident Evil'. But what do I know? The outcome of PWSA's questionable experiment is nothing short of blasphemy. I expected low quality, but wow. It only gets and E for effort. If this was already the 'best' I don't know what's about to come after it...",5,0,3,10 April 2020
Quantum of Solace," Bond NO! - Bond YES!
","'Quantum of Solace' is a 2008 action thriller directed by Marc Forster starring Daniel Craig and Olga Kurylenko. It has been a hard week for Bond fans all over the world as the highly anticipated conclusion 'No Time To Die' was delayed, but even though the final film of this saga was postponed to November, my brother and I decided to still keep on watching the previous films and will conclude this project in fall then. Til then we're gonna have some fun with them. Well, in the cases of the first sequel it's a slightly different business concerning enjoyment and quality. While the predecessor was an ingenious and well executed balance act between heart racing action sequences and packing thriller elements this one appears to just be the shadow of it. Too much in this feels uncomfortably poorly conceived and it resulted in a single mess. Over seventy percent of the film's criminally short run time consist of fast paced action scenes and chase sequences with too many explosions. At times it felt like I was watching Michael Bay's attempt of staging a story about the MI6 agent. It literally appeared they have taken one of the two cores of 'Casino Royale' and tried to stretch it and make a whole movie out of it - while letting out the atmospheric thriller aspect. But it's not the only flaw the film suffers from: The script is also a dull and lazy mess of a plot. Most of the character decisions are utterly stupid and most of them are made by Bond himself and I couldn't recognise his character anymore. While he was cool, smart and always seemed to have had a Plan B before, he's shown a totally different behaviour here. Most of the actions were extremely stupid and made no sense considering he's a spy with a mission. He killed way too many people he was supposed to interrogate and threw himself in countless situations that should have cost his life, but he still managed to get out of them. You think because he has had all of it planned out? Well, no. He mostly was extremely lucky and somehow had to deal with even more stupid henchmen. It's nothing about calculation and keeping a cool head, he literally dived into every situation and could barely keep his head above water. It was almost hilarious and made me think that James's favourite hobby is to freak out M in any possible way and make all of his employers hate him. You can literally summarize all the scenes with 'Bond No! - Bond Yes!' and I think that already says it all. It's not even better that the film attempts to be self aware of his behaviour, because it just isn't a comedy. Aside from this, the side characters introduced in here are characters I couldn't care less about. Camille was as shallow as the water at the beach of Haiti and Dominic Greene was a laughingstock compared to Le Chiffre. Having both of them as replacements and successors of Eva Green and Mads Mikkelsen respectively was a huge disappointment and an extreme downgrade. Even a reappearance of Mathis couldn't save it all. Wasn't the whole film supposed to be about the titular secret organisation 'Quantum' in the first place? Funnily enough, I still didn't fully understand what it is all about. I did get that the organisation's purpose is e.g. to grant warlords the power to take over their countries, in this case in Bolivia, in exchange for oil and water. But where did it come from? Who founded it? Why didn't any of the secret intelligence agencies know about it? To me, it sounded like an extreme threat in the beginning, but in the end it appears to be nothing but a small gang of a French philanthropist who was smart enough to make deals with stereotypical Americans that crave for oil and profit. It's getting even funnier, cause after the final showdown Bond himself says that he finally knows what Quantum is. Why does the main character know the truth but I don't? Will it be dealt with in the sequels? Cause I sat there and had to laugh, because the so called secret organisation was anything but totally uncovered to me. Next to this, the final conclusion is one of the most untypical sequences in this film and only shows action again. Where's the intriguing thriller? There's only shooting and explosions, nothing more and all about revenge and not about a mission. All in all, this film is a messy and less lavishly elaborated copy of it's predecessor that counts on high speed action instead of being a thriller and consists of too much mindless behaviour and character decisions. It's an absolute downgrade and even though it's a decent fun, didn't leave any impact on me and is absolutely forgettable nevertheless. I only hope 'Skyfall' will fly up again, cause this enactment is just a mess.",6,1,1,10 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I paid for a blockbuster, I got a cheap western
","'Once Upon A Time ... In Hollywood' is a 2019 crime drama directed by Quentin Tarantino starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. After learning this film received a seven minute standing ovation at the premiere in Cannes I was even more pumped for this film. Over a year ago, when the first images were released, I was so excited I couldn't even put it in words. I mean, Pitt and DiCaprio, both exceptionally gifted actors leading a star-studded cast of beloved legends as well as promising newcomers, even in the smallest role. All of them directed by Tarantino. What could go wrong then? Tragically, so much. The biggest flaw of this film definitely is it's run time of almost three hours. In the most instances it was extremely boring and almost made me fall asleep in multiple occasions. Mostly because the 'movie-in-movie' scenes were absolute irrelevant. It might be excellently acted by DiCaprio and Co., but only because of the actors ability. It's like he played the phone book to me: It would definitely be great judging by how he does it, but after all it would still be the freakin phone book. Forty percent of the plot consists of cheesy western scenes - was this really necessary? It felt like an uninteresting Making Of of a cheap western and not like a Tarantino blockbuster. Additionally, the plot had zero substance and didn't even build up any suspense. Just take a look at the Spahn Ranch scene. I expected something horrifying, a conclusion to the mystery, but ultimately it was just as the characters said. What was the purpose of it? I was sitting there uncomfortably and wondered when the pure boredom would finally end. It might be beautifully shot and visually captured the essence of the 1960s, but that's all, the story didn't offer any interesting turns at all, neither do the characters show any development in the end. Next to this, what's the point of casting actors who accurately look like their real life counterparts just to have them show up only as extended cameos? Mostly insulting was the appearance of Bruce Lee. Mike Moh might have nailed the mimic and look, but the way his character is depicted is nothing but a shame. Everyone else looked perfect and showed the original characteristics, why was Lee an arrogant and cocky prick? It's both an insult towards him as a human being and the Eastern film industry itself. Also, what's the point of casting accurate actors just to let them appear for no longer than a few minutes? After the painful first two and a half hours of visually appealing nonsense the final scenes finally showed at least some Tarantino flair. The brutal and gruesome violence is the only proof for the director's origins in the art house genre and even reminded me of 'Reservoir Dogs' for a few seconds. That's the only point I've thoroughly enjoyed as it showed the usual cinematic output of QT. The alternative reality depicted in this film is a well written conclusion and was the only acceptable way to depict these tragic events. It treats the legacy of Sharon Tate with immense respect and I liked that a lot. But as the credits rolled I realized that her complete character arc was totally irrelevant for the plot and only there to lure us cinema goers. It sad to see that all the big names only function as a bait for the audience and it was all about the money. The director himself called this a love letter to Hollywood. To me, it feels more like the work of a man that forgot about his cinematic roots and traded his personal beliefs and edgy directorial style for lots of money and the acceptance of the mainstream audience and critics. One could already feel that he isn't able to keep up with the quality anymore in 'The Hateful Eight', but compared to this mess it's another 'Pulp Fiction'. All in all, this film is a complete disaster that generated so much hype and delivered so poorly. It's a cinematic mess with such a promising premise, but such a catastrophic execution. Although it stars many of my favourite actors and actresses to date, the sloppy writing prevents it from being an enjoyable experience. In the end, it's the biggest disappointment of the year that miserably failed my expectations. A wasted opportunity, overrated and nonsensical, the highly acclaimed Quentin Tarantino lost his credibility with. Only in the end it shows a small light of what has been years ago, overall it's absolutely forgettable. Sad but true, he just isn't able to make great films anymore. I should have spent my money on something else. Never been so much disappointed after visiting the cinema...",4,3,7,9 October 2019
Get Out," The sinking feeling sets...
","'Get Out' is a 2017 horror thriller directed by Jordan Peele starring Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams. There have been only a handful of original films in the recent years that have already become sort of modern cult classic and as far as I can tell from all the reactions it received, this thriller definitely is one of them. My parents for example watched it and both of them gave it a perfect score and it made me even more curious. As you may believe it or not, I actually managed to avoid any kind of spoiler since it came out three years ago. So did my brother who I was watching it with and after showing him the summary of the film he genuinely asked 'And where's the horror in it?' and I couldn't tell. I knew that something would happen, but I had not one single clue. That's why this film hit me in a extraordinary way. In the beginning the whole film appears to be so innocent and literally calm, as it was just the whole 'black man meets the parents of his white girlfriend for the first time' theme that could not be any more natural. But after the deer was hit by the car, the feature increasingly became more and more unsettling. The score did most of the work and, just like in the best Kubrick's features, began to more and more hypnotize the audience with it's eerie sounds. I think it's also phenomenal how this state of uneasiness is also created from what seems to be an idyllic setting - there's literally nothing horrifying in the first place. It's just the house of a seemingly regular white and wealthy family. So where's the horror? Before it comes to this part, the movie basically depicts a social drama with thriller elements in the first half and all of it is uncomfortable to watch, but in a positive way. It hits at the exact right spots with its extreme awkwardness as it boldly shows that intolerance and reluctance between African-American and Caucasian still exists in our modern society and simultaneously reminds us to show more compassion to everyone and to not judge anyone by their skin colour. I mean, just notice all the black and white contrasts in the background and the reference to Jesse Owens for example. I think Peele successfully reached his goal to raise awareness to this delicate topic, without being too accusatory. After the first hints have been given at times in the first sixty minutes, the second half starts to offer everything it's got. I could tell that the film literally was discomforting to me as I made not a single noise throughout the entire run time, because I felt my heart beating in my chest. It genuinely scared me. What the director created with this was far beyond my imagination. White aristocrats participating in an auction about who will be the next to transfer their existence in the hollow shell of what is left of a once living human being? Just imagine this hell of a twist! In the end it even gave me 'Resident Evil 7' vibes, the only difference being that that the protagonist has to deal with an upper class maniac family instead of obviously insane and cursed hillbillies. The only thing that has probably cursed them is pure racism and greed for profit, maybe even just pure pleasure. It's perverted and horrendous at the same time and definitely gave me the chills, because the whole conflict is not resolved until the very last few seconds. All in all, this genre shifting gem is a brilliant depiction of what still is one of the greatest problems of the world we we live in and even though it's lead as absurdum in the end, never loses the grip of it's original and realistic massage. Lead by a magnificent Kaluuya (this man's ability to cry!) the film slow but surely descends into pure madness and never fails to scare the audience, may it be the horror or the social criticism. It's a tremendously important film and it's more than deserved that this film won the Academy Award for best original screenplay. This film is a sinking feeling that sets.",9,1,5,26 January 2020
Gran Torino," It's all about life and death
","'Gran Torino' is a 2008 drama directed by Clint Eastwood starring him and Bee Vang. Not many people have managed to stay relevant in Hollywood for more than fifty years and be known to several different generations like Clint Eastwood did. The legend is the prime example of seemingly never-ending fame, as he established himself as an actor at an early age and discovered his talent as a not less brilliant director in the sere and yellow as well. While I can't really call myself a fan of his acting roles of the beginning of his career (I haven't seen enough titles to judge that), I certainly consider myself an admirer of his later work and especially his directorial features. From merciless western 'Unforgiven' over heartbreaking sports drama 'Million Dollar Baby' to this 2008 feature I love all of them, and the last two received perfect scores as I have watched them early in January 2018. Since it has been more than two years since I watched them both and my taste in films has changed a lot since then, I decided to finally revisit them and see if they still live up to their perfect rating. In the case of this one, I can say beforehand, it definitely still does. What Eastwood has created with this movie is nothing short of masterfully breathtaking drama. In the focus of the film is his character Walt Kowalski, a grumpy old racist who seems to be annoyed by everyone and everything, especially after his wife has passed away. The only relatives he has left are his grown-up sons and their own families, the thing is that the relationship between them is rather estranged and dysfunctional than happy and healthy. Hence, he is a loner who is only accompanied by his dog Daisy and a lot of alcohol. The fact that he is a total racist and probably knows more racial slurs than common words should not make him any more congenial, but surprisingly, it is still impossible to hate him completely, as the tough cookie still shows a lot of vulnerability at times that gives him a lot of sympathy to him. What I am trying to say is that the way the film establishes its original and tremendously authentic characters is without a doubt one of its biggest strengths, because how is it plausible to still like a racist character? The answer is the background. It is often mentioned that Walt served in the Korean War and that it is the burnt in enemy image that created his basic scorn for Asian people, especially for his Hmong neighbours, but one of the most outstanding things this film depicts that it is possible that a stubborn old man like him with an obviously outdated world view allows himself to learn and over the course of the film discover a new form of sympathy he never felt before. It is one of the most outstanding character developments I have ever seen in a motion picture. Seriously. As he accidentally saves the Hmong family next door from being killed, he becomes a hero against his own will and that is where his transformation begins. The more he gets to know about the foreign culture, the people and their habits and realizes that he actually has a lot in common with them, the more he overcomes his stereotypical thinking. Even when he sometimes makes a prejudice induced comment, it is not tolerated just like this, because his opposite knows how to deal with his quirks and actually offending behaviour. While it is Thao who affronts him in the second half of the film, it is teenage girl Sue who defies him with her sassy but extremely smart clap backs and thus earns his respect in the process. It is palpable that he more and more takes them into his heart and accepts that all his previous prejudices turn out to be wrong. Why else would he take the boy under his wings who almost stole his car, the titular Gran Torino, and who he almost killed after he has caught him while attempting that? He and Thao more and more from and unlikely teacher-and-student bond and even friendship in the process and he even worries about him and Sue and wants to enable that both of them have a bright future and don't end up on the street of the ghetto they live in, like most of the people from that area do. The man who hated everyone and everything that is related to the Asian culture suddenly learns a lot about compassion and benevolence, they even sort of become the family he wished he had. It is even getting to the point that he realizes that the local gang is the only reason why his new friends will never have the future he wants them to have. As things escalate heavily, he knows the only solution and as the viewer I thought he would take it in his own hands and kill everyone who stands in his way, but what happened then is what I consider to be one of the greatest moments in the history of drama. Instead of the bloody massacre everyone probably expected, he makes the ultimate sacrifice and makes sure that he gets killed without carrying a weapon himself. Who does he manage to do that? In this extremely intelligent scene that was sort of foreshadowed before, he pretends to draw his gun, only to reveal that he was reaching for his lighter. Thus, every member of the criminal gang is charged for murder of an unarmed man, what allows the neighbourhood to become safe for a very long time. I am not ashamed to admit that this scene once again made me cry, because this selfless act is not just beautiful but also indescribably breathtaking. The antihero who almost shot everyone with his rifle in the beginning ends up sacrificing himself so that the same people will live in peace after all. If you can tell me a better redemption story and character conversion, go ahead and make my day. On top of that, there is also the fact that it is implied that he is suffering from a fatal disease and instead of taking it to the grave he is using it for a pure act of charity. I think this is just the final statement of the life and death metaphoric that is constantly conveyed throughout the film, mostly through the conversations between Walt and Father Janovich. He has killed dozens of people in the past and was only honoured for murder, so to make peace with himself, he settles the score by sacrificing himself in order to ensure the future of his loved ones and thus will be remembered for giving life. He settled his affairs and uses it for something selfless. If that doesn't make me cry, I don't know what does. What underlines this feeling even more is Eastwood's powerful and versatile performance and the tremendously intelligently written dialogues. The fact that the film ends with the reading of the will in which he gives everything he has ever owned (including the precious car) to the ones who really cared for him instead of his own flesh and blood rounds it all up perfectly. It is never to late to learn and make amends and this film shows it in a masterful way. All in all, this drama remains one of my favourite dramas and still holds up to its original perfect score. In all its facets, this film is perfect to me, as it includes a perfectly build up story and character development, a powerhouse performance of its lead actor, extremely intelligent dialogue and authentic characters. This film undoubtedly has got a lot of heart and doesn't fail to tantalise my emotions. It is amazingly original, brutally realistic and touching and most importantly, beautifully heartbreaking. Some people might not agree, but this film is pure perfection to me and deservedly ranks up extremely high in the list of my all-time favourites. Clint Eastwood is an absolute legend and this film is the proof why.",10,0,0,12 May 2020
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Fistfight, you mutated fool
","'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is a 2004 horror film and video game adaptation directed by Alexander Witt starring Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory. After the catastrophe the original film has been, my expectations towards the following films sank even lower. I wasn't hoping for anything anymore, to be honest. So I was mildly surprised that the first sequel was a minimal improvement to the first movie. Still not a groundbreaking achievement, but better. First of all, it was appeasing to see that the film finally has drawn on its source material in any way and created the apocalyptic scenario that followed after the outbreak in Raccoon City. It's obvious that the film was conceived on the basis of 'Resident Evil: Nemesis', focused more on the action than on any type of horror and that's probably the best thing that could have happened to it. Former director Anderson now functions as the writer and leads the audience through a story that least feels more like an actual RE adaptation, even if it is far away from being as packing as the original game. Honestly, it even started out decently. For example, I literally screamed when I saw that it finally included one of the game's actual protagonists, Jill Valentine and that they even made a great casting choice in her case. On top of that, she's furthermore wearing her iconic 'Last Escape' outfit and also nails her movements and other character traits. What's wrong then? The thing is that they degraded her to nothing but a meaningless side character who doesn't really get the chance to shine. The same applies to the mercenary trio centered around Carlos Olivera: great to see them featured in a similar scenario, but underused nevertheless. They might have copied whole sequences from the game shot by shot, but to me it feels like they were only written into the movie in the fear of fan's repeated negative reactions. Oh, and how they misused the Ashfords was dumb as well. The biggest disappointment of the whole film is how they depicted Nemesis. At first, I thought it could be actually great, but in the end they characterized him absolutely wrong. How could you even fail this simple task? In the game he's this giant, inevitable threat and haunting demon that terrorises you restlessly, makes your heart race and gives you severe nightmares you will never really recover from. What the hell is he here? A regular sized, way too lame and absolutely harmlessly looking abomination that's neither a danger or somewhat scary. He does nothing but walking slowly, shooting with the same two weapons over and over again. Not running mercilessly once. Not killing someone brutally once. Not becoming his totally gross final form once. It's not underwhelming. It's a shame and it almost made me cry that they wasted such a great opportunity and made him so absolutely meaningless. At least it hasn't kept me from finding some sort of guilty pleasure in this film, though. Milla Jovovich is more badass than ever and she goes along with the side characters pretty well, even if I wished they had more screentime. What surprised me the most though is how it was finally able to develop a nearly decent atmosphere the first outing dismally lacked. Not only had it obviously better visual effects and some actually enjoyable scenes, the way it started out and how the story developed even gave me the feeling that I might be watching a film that's gonna be more than mediocrity. I was dumb to think that. Probably forgot that one of the most incompetent director's was still in charge of writing the story. While the premise was acceptable the film became more stupid from scene to scene. Until the final act. It gave me the rest. Not only has it some laughably obvious plot holes ('How did she get up the skyscraper so quickly?', I uttered) it's total garbage as both a final conclusion and as a decision in general as well. I lost my mind when Alice was forced to have a fistfight with Nemesis and even more when he developed some kind of emotional world and saved her while sacrificing himself. Absolutely ridiculous and brain melting all the same. What happend from there on is beyond my understanding. Setting up the next sequel, obviously, but it's so unnecessarily dumb. All in all, it's definitely better than the first entry of the franchise, but still a terrible film nevertheless. While it shows more understanding of its source material, it still wasn't able to comprehend its full potential. In the beginning it wasn't even that awful, but the unrealistic and just laughable ending make it what it is: Another failed attempt to bring a classic video game to the big screen. When it's not possible to adapt it perfectly due to missing technology there's one advice: Just don't try it. Another proof for me that Anderson shouldn't have done this. It's even more ironic after I have read that he heavily criticised director Witt for his work on this film. He's definitely not the most competent director, but as if Anderson made the perfect adaptation, you know? So ironic. This series can't get any better than this, I know that, but it's without a doubt cheesy fun to watch. Onto the next one.",5,0,3,11 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," As Kylo said, let the past die
","'Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi' is a 2017 science fiction film directed by Rian Johnson starring Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. Back when I was a kid, this saga was a key element of my daily life. I had dozens of shirts and tons of merch and considered myself as a hardcore fan. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole six films (yes, even the prequels) and was always sad when the credits for Episode VI rolled, knowing there will never be a continuation. Years later, after Disney bought the franchise, my wish became reality. I was so hyped to see what the next generation would achieve in this beloved franchise of mine. In 2016, I finally had the time and chance to experience the seventh installment and although I thought it was great, it was still a bit disappointing as the people around me considered it as the best of them all. Since then, I lost the interest in the whole universe, especially after realising that there were way too many projects in this saga. Star Wars films became mass products and I disliked that a lot. But now that the final conclusion hit the theatres, my brother told me how great the sequel trilogy is and actually caught my curiosity, but before I get to watch the series finale, I had to check out the probably most hated entry of the saga, abhorred by the fans and praised by the critics. So, after four years of literal abstinence, I finally revisited the galaxy far, far away and it made me feel like a kid again. First of all, the film looks beautiful from start to finish and the modern technology enable the creators to create something that is way beyond phenomenal. The scenery and especially the aliens and animals are well designed and reminded me of the good old times. The other thing I noticed was how the film (like the MCU films) had instances of humour in it. I had mixed feelings about it, to be honest, on one hand it was kinda enjoyable, but on the other hand unnecessary. Furthermore, I als noticed the things that bugged the hardcore fans the most, but I considered them as so small and irrelevant that I even enjoyed most of them. The problem most fans had with this entry was probably that the director didn't follow the usual pattern of how SW films were made in the past. He went in his own direction and made some decisions that wouldn't appease all the fans, but this is what made this film so good for me. Nobody expected Smoke to be killed of in this film, that's what makes it so interesting, because they tried to do something all new. Also, many fans complained that Luke wasn't in the main focus of the film. He was never supposed to. All characters from the original trilogy only play supporting roles and are only there to pass the torch to the new generation. In my humble opinion, the only logical decision one could make. They already played their part, that's it. Now it's about Rey, Kylo Ren, Poe Dameron and Finn, the first two being two of the most interesting characters in the franchise that ever existed. Both actors are extremely talented, Adam Driver even is one of my favourite actors of the current generation. There's no black and white anymore, they both rank somewhere in between the old balance and that was one of the best decisions Johnson ever could have taken. There doesn't need to be an all bad guy anymore, but therefore people need to get out of their comfort zone. Next to this, it still had enough connections to the original trilogy: Luke and Leia reappearing, R2-D2 reuniting with his owner and most importantly, my favourite moment of the film, the appearance of Master Yoda. It gave me goosebumps to see the old puppet in action again, it tried to make such connections without losing its originality and it succeeded with this. Also, it had enough epic moments in it (the tag team fight, the face off with Luke) and even the side story of Finn and Rose was kinda enjoyable (still don't understand the hate towards her character) and in general it had a well thought out plot and story. It combined multiple story lines and it never became boring, not even a single second. A movie that runs more than two and a half hours never appeared so short to me. Of course they could have gotten deeper in the Grey Jedi philosophy, but I wouldn't consider it as a wasted opportunity, instead they did something no-one has seen coming, and I applaud for this brave decision. The death of Luke Skywalker had a meaning and it was a magnificent farewell to this character, as I said, he played his part. All in all, this installment is a surprisingly terrific entry in the saga. It's not what people expected, hence the sheer amount of hate for it. What others dislike is what I personally cherish, it tried to do something all new and went in a direction that nobody expected and that's what deserves my respect. As I said, I have been gone from this galaxy for almost four years and had zero expectations about it and that's probably my advantage. In the end, the general rating is low, because we all know that nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans themselves. As someone who enjoyed most of the films, I had no problem with it and it even made me curious about the final episode. An enjoyable film for those who go into it with and open mind. Don't expect anything, free yourself from frantic expectations and enjoy a film that finally brought fresh air into an old saga. Disney didn't ruin the franchise, they resurrected it greatly. It's an unpopular opinion, but I'm standing behind every single word and that's what makes me happy, because it made fun from start to finish.",8,13,33,24 December 2019
Evil Dead," Hugs not drugs. Or reading books about sinister magic.
","'Evil Dead' is a 2013 horror film directed by Fede Alvarez starring Jane Levy and Shiloh Fernandez. Given the current global pandemic and the recommended measure to avoid human contact I thought it was time to check out a film about a group of friends who practice social distancing. Or kind of. They might summon the most evil forces of ancient magic, but therefore don't contract a dangerous virus. Alright, let's put the jokes aside. The people who know me also know that I consider the original Sam Raimi flick as one of the greatest horror films of all time and even adore the sequels, just for it's sheer amount pioneering filmmaking and groundbreaking kind of horror it deals with. It's always an absolute pleasure to rewatch it over and over again and it always amazes as if I was watching it for the very first time again. Reading the previous sentences probably gave you a small glimpse of my endless love for this low budget movie and probably leaves you thinking 'Oh, what's his opinion on this heavily discussed remake then?'. Before watching it, I also wondered what it would turn out like. Surprisingly, it's not even as horrendous as I thought. At least in terms of quality, I mean. What mostly surprised me in a positive way is how the film elaborated a whole new premise that at the same time honours the original flick tremendously. The reinterpretation now deals with a group of friends who try to help their mutual friend to get off drugs and become clean again. The location and general story remain the same, but there's a whole new character constellation that has rough edges and unresolved conflicts that slowly begin to uncover. Except for Natalie each and everyone is at least explored a little and plays a more or less significant role in this story, but the main focus lies on the bond between the siblings Mia and David who still haven't fully recovered from a shared family tragedy. It might not sound like much, but it's so pleasant to see protagonists with personalities and values they believe in. Makes it so much easier to care about them in the process. At least does this count for the two siblings. The others are pushed back in the background too much in the process, but considering that it was sorta predictable makes it tolerable in some way. Furthermore, the premise makes the character development more convincing, as they only slowly begin to believe that what is happening to Mia isn't only hallucinations resulting from her drug abuse. Gives it more of a realistic touch to it, you know? Makes it only credible that they firstly try to explain things reasonably before accepting that sinister forces haunt them. Next to this, the story changed its primary focus tremendously. That's probably the only issue I have with this film. While the original packed me on a deep level and is an atmospheric thrill from the moment on the Ash's car arrives at the cabin, the remake obviously concentrates on the effects and disregards to elaborate the feeling of massive threat. I don't want to say that I wasn't scared at all, but I was missing the infamous atmosphere that made the original so outstanding. Thus I was less terrified than I originally expected. Therefore it has shown that's it's an absolutely brutal splatter instead.
Oh boy, those effects were definitely bloody and absolutely gruesome. Most of them had me exclaim some words that are too inappropriate to mention here, but believe, it was so realistic it felt like I was experiencing it myself. What also attracted my interest was to see that this film is obviously a major influence for 'Resident Evil 7', practically even more than the original flick. I love this game, just saying. The film might offer some corny lines of dialogue, but fortunately offered enough surprising twists to let me ignore them. In the original it was clear after the first incident that Ashley would survive, but seeing that Mia would be the lone survivor after previously having been possessed was a decent twist. To be honest, Jane Levy's performance is the secret highlight of this film, as she literally shows her whole emotional range. And yes, it's also mentionable that she absolutely nailed to convey the feeling of terror only with her facial expressions, especially her eyes. The story goes on with another few pleasant surprises and some welcome homages to the Raimi films and in the end even unfolds the maximum of gore horror that was absolutely stunning to witness. Another surprise I totally didn't expect was that everything even worked as one big metaphor for drug addiction, coming down from it and facing one's demons. Mia walking towards the sunrise after leaving all behind, simply appeased the poet in me. All in all, this is a well made readaptation of a beloved classic that manages to successfully create something on its own and at the same time honours its source material. It's an absolutely gory experience with a few new aspects that result from a different but not terrible approach to become the one infamously grotesque film of its respective generation. Considering that it's heavily cut in mainstream stores and rarely available as an uncut version, makes me think that it has more or less reached its goal. It's far away from being the original film, but I'm bold enough to say that it at least deserves to be called ... groovy! I mean, Ash approves in the end, why wouldn't I?",7,0,0,22 March 2020
The Evil Dead," The Holy Grail Of Splatter Horror!
","'The Evil Dead' is a 1981 horror film written and directed by Sam Raimi starring Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss. There's probably no movie more controversial and simultaneously beloved than Sam Raimi's directorial debut. In Germany it was banned and highly cut for more than three decades and only hardcore fans had the chance to own it. It literally was unavailable as an uncut version until 2017 and now it's even rated 16. Last year I had the chance to finally experience what's claimed to be the holy grail of horror and I was tremendously impressed. This year, it did not change a bit. Unlike most people from my generation, I absolutely love this film for what it is. From start to finish it offers a gripping and sinister atmosphere that always sends shivers down my spine. Every single frame of this brims over with pure horror and it's incomparably iconic. While there's not much dialogue and the characters make some questionable decisions, it's scores with the pictures that speak for themselves. The best of it all are the absolutely gross and bloody special and make-up effects that haven't aged that well, but still manage to terrorise the audience with their excessive vehemence. Furthermore, every single character is worked out so well and sympathic, especially Campbell's Ashley Williams, the hesitant protagonist and hero against his own will. He really carries most of the film with his genuine coolness and well-paced character development. A hero the scared viewer can easily identify with. Next to this, the plot offers a lot of terrifying ideas and plays them out extremely well. Considering that this is a low budget production it made every single penny worth it. All in all, Sam Raimi created a timeless and horrifying splatter masterpiece that lives from its gorgeous effects and iconic scenes. Although it was a college student film it managed to become an infamous cult classic that will always scare the hell out of teenager generations to come. It might not have aged perfectly, but that's what makes it so special and remarkable. It breathes the essence of 80s horror. Also, it's absolutely inspiring for young filmmakers and shows them that you can achieve so much with so little. An all-time favourite that will never get boring. I love it!",9,1,2,21 October 2019
Hotel Transylvania," A welcome change from the masterpieces
","'Hotel Transylvania' is a 2012 animated feature directed by Genndy Tartakovsky with the voices of Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg. There are only a few animated feature films aside that don't origin from the power conglomerate Disney/Pixar that actually entertain me. Next to a few DreamWorks films, such as 'Shrek', 'Kung Fu Panda' or 'Mega Mind' or the Illumination hit 'Despicable Me' it is this movie from Sony that I actually like a lot. Even if it isn't the awesome film I considered it to be when I was only twelve years old, I still think it is worth giving a watch and a welcome alternation from all the masterpieces from the other studios, even from a today's point of view. And since it was the birthday of my younger sisters and they got to decide what to watch, I thought I would join them. As I said before, I like to watch it from time to time, even if it has some undeniable massive flaws I cannot close my eyes to. What I think makes this film so cute is how it introduces children to the classic monsters like Dracula, Frankenstein etc. and gives them the chance to get to know them for the very first time in their life. For avid horror fans it probably is also a nice welcome to see their favourites in a child appropriate way and it might even be some sort of fun to try to spot all the Easter eggs and variety of classic creatures used in this flick. I mean, you even get some middle-aged Gremlins that want to relax at the pool. How cool is that? Even when the premise of 'What if monsters are actually scared by humans?' was famously illuminated in the Pixar classic 'Monsters Inc.' it is still tolerable in this case, as it adds another facet to it: racism. Yes, indeed, this film deals with the problem of stereotypical thinking and the general danger of racism and teaches the younger ones about it in a child friendly manner. On top of that it depicts the monsters as harmless and gives them human characteristics. The Werewolf is an exhausted family father with God knows how many children, Frankenstein's monster looks like a middleclass man with a middleclass job and the Invisible Man is ... well, he is invisible, but the main focus of course lies on Dracula and the close bond with his teenage daughter Mavis. Who would have guessed that the bloodsucking count is actually a caring and worried father, if not control freak? The animation style and narration are far away from being as deep as the titles from its competitors, but still it conveys an easily understandable message for both kids and parents: sometimes you got to let your kids decide on their own and sometimes it is necessary to rethink about specific things. Like, you probably don't want to be responsible for your child missing their Zing, right? This film could have been immensely better if it wasn't for one thing: Sandler. While I am personally able to laugh about most of his films, each has this typical Sandler thing to it. Any film contains at least on moment of sheer stupidity and this film makes no exception. It has this typical pinch of 'I am trying to be funny' Sandler-esque nonsense in several scenes that made it extremely cringey and disturbed the experience a lot. Oh, and don't get me started about that dance party at the end of the film. I absolutely hate autotune and the music genre attached to it. It makes me break out in spots in the matter of seconds. Urgh. All in all though, this film is a decent flick I like to rewatch from time to time and even when it is far away from reaching the high quality of the other studios, it works for younger children and that's the audience this film has aimed for. It is cute, has a lot of good ideas and most importantly, doesn't lack any heart. It is nothing an adult would probably consider to be the best, but a fun flick to watch in between with your kids. To be honest, I am going to check out the sequels as well. Let's see if they are at least as enjoyable as this one.",7,0,1,23 May 2020
Midsommar," Overhyped and way too slow
","'Midsommar' is a 2019 horror thriller directed by Ari Aster starring Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor. The film company A24 has released a few hidden gems in the recent years and is becoming more and more popular as an independent film studio. Many of them even have come cult classics at times. While I've seen only a handful of them ('The Killing Of A Sacred Deer', 'Ex Machina', 'Locke' to name a few) there are countless other titles that still have my curiosity. Two of them are the features by promising novice film maker Ari Aster. Judging by what I've heard about them from several people they both have to be secret masterpieces. While I'm not yet able to judge it in the case of the director's directorial debut (it's up high on my watchlist!) I can tell that this film here ... is not. Yeah, you read correctly. As I said, my expectations were lifted extremely high after hearing it's supposed to be great, many even stating it's the new 'The Wicker Man' (no opportunity to compare there, too), but it simple isn't. Back then I've seen the trailer for this film and thought I would be in for some grotesque psychological thriller that would haunt me days after the credits have rolled. The only feeling that still accompanies me is confusion, as I still try to figure out where the extreme hype results from. Before we get to this, let's start with something positive: Florence Pugh. Not only is she one of my favourite actors since I've seen here outstanding performance in 'Little Women' she's also showing her extreme talent in here. She's one of the most promising newcomers and once again proves why and additionally, she's such a beauty to look at as well. The most important thing though is how he conveys her whole emotional range and acts so outstandingly with her facial expressions, but even with an absolutely charismatic and powerful lead actress it doesn't change the fact the the whole screenplay is a confusing mess. Firstly, I gulped when I saw the total runtime of roughly two and a half hours (the extended cut adding thirty minutes more, but I went with the first) and thought how it's supposed to stretch its decent yet pretty simple premise to a format like that. To be honest, I was expecting an extremely tardy narrative structure, but this film is more than a slow burner. This term wouldn't make it justice. It takes a lot of time to introduce us to the characters that (except for Dani) I couldn't quite find any form of connection to. If you have seen the film you'll know that it literally spends a lot of time to show how characters introduce themselves to each other. I mean, literally. I was wondering if anything particular would happen, but aside from a drug trip and the introduction of dozens of side characters there was nothing quite interesting happening. Not until one hour and four minutes into the film (I paused at that moment) where I could experience why it was almost rated NC-17 (and why it is rated 16 in Germany) and what would partly justify its label as a horror film. It's definitely gruesome brutality, but there where less than a handful of scenes with a similar brutality. Aside from them, there was basically nothing. From there on I tried to view it as some sort of psychological thriller instead and focussed on that aspect, but even that wasn't quite what the film was. That's what I slowly began to realise. It had severe tonal difficulties and had problems to settle for one kind of horror. There are notable works in the history of cinema that achieved to create a combination of several subgenres of horror, but this film definitely isn't one of them. Therefore, it's a messy mishmash of poorly elaborated approaches. It's lacks the scary atmosphere and some sort of unnerving tension to be a classic horror film, it lacks extremely bloody effects to be a gore gem and it is way too tame to be a packing psychological horror thriller. It tries to be all of it, but fails to be something memorable in the end. Instead it focuses on the traditions and the way of life of a Swedish village and their cult. It felt like it was giving away some hints to something more sinister, a devastatingly shocking final reveal, but it built up to nothing. Nothing outrageous. Nothing shocking. Nothing scandalous. Not even the actually well composed and moderately unnerving sound score or the hallucinatory cinematography couldn't quite bring me in any specific mood. I indeed understood the subtle metaphor of loss, grief and a form of catharsis interwoven with a relationship/breakup subplot, but it's nothing that made the experience any more entertaining. I gotta say, on a percentage basis I was more bored than actually having fun in any way. I probably lasted to the end, because of Pugh's simple presence and talent. All in all, this film is anything but the masterpiece many claim it to be and suffers from so many problems that made it impossible for me to fully enjoy it in any way, the center flaw being the painfully slow pace. I generally love slow burners, but in other cases they offer something then. This film doesn't. It rather loses itself in its details and wastes much of its time to try out several genres without settling for one in the end, what makes it a sloppy rather than deliberately constructed mess. What upsets me the most is that it had so much potential and had a few correct approaches, but in the end is neither scary nor gory, at most mildly disturbing. It's wonderful to look at, but absolutely not the genre redefining masterpiece it's claimed to be. It's more forgettable than iconic. I couldn't really say what's more exciting: This film or shopping at IKEA. I can tell you, one thing is overhyped as hell and shattered my high hopes to experience a modern horror classic. It's a 'nej' from me.",6,0,5,10 April 2020
The Graduate," The lives of the beautiful people
","'The Graduate' is 1967 drama directed by Mike Nichols starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. Back in the day, this film sparked a controversy, because it has been the first film to depict the forbidden relationship between a young man and an older woman. What now has become normalcy in our society made the people feel uncomfortable in the sixties and that's one of the few reasons this film became a classic. In his feature film debut and his first leading role Dustin Hoffman plays his character Benjamin Braddock with such a genuine naiveté and awkwardness that the viewer immediately can sympathize with him a lot. To be honest, although he was already thirty years old at the time of filming he played the part of a twenty-one boy convincingly. From the first shot the film builds up a packing atmosphere. Everything seems to be perfect around Benjamin who visibly struggles with his own anxiety about the future and the expectations of his parents. I personally liked this hypocritical tone and how it subliminally critises the situation without condemning it. But the best part of the films starts when Mrs. Robinson, magnificently portrayed by Anne Bancroft, enters the scene. After this there's an extremely uncomfortable tension that honestly took my breath several time. It's scandalously revealing and thanks to superb character play, extremely compelling and entertaining. It's not only this. The analyst in me was also appeased, because there's a prominent metaphor in it that gave the whole film an all new second meaning: What is even the reason behind Ben's decision to fall for his seductress? It's ingenious how the screenplay shows that he is depressed and doesn't know how to deal with his future and with his life in general, although it's supposed to be perfect. This is feeling, this frustration is what made him fall for his temptations. Said metaphor is the pool that occurs multiple time. When his parents force him to dive he's unhappy but it's what his parents wanted, but after the first experience with his affair he floats on it and doesn't care about his parents who want him to care about his career. It's social satire at it's best and I love that. As the film goes on, the conflict begins to become increasingly subliminal and what I can only imagine, extremely hard to watch for the people back then. At times it even offers some funny, even macabre undertone without losing its seriousness. If there's anything to criticize here it's the second half, because the said conflict shifts to a less packing scenario and although it's still great, makes the tension recede a little. But it's still packing and fits with the overall tone of the film, mostly due to the ingeniously accentuating soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel and their classic track 'Mrs. Robinson'. All in all, this atmospheric satire hits at the right spots and entertains due to excellent actors in every role and a plot that doesn't hesitate to agitate the important issue that kids and their futures should not be ignored or decided by parents. It's legitimately scandalous, but not only because it's unusually revealing, because it raises an uncomfortable topic. Anyways, it deserves it's cult status and remains an infamously pioneering piece of art.",9,0,0,4 January 2020
Singin' in the Rain," The titular song is still stuck in my head
","'Singin' In The Rain' is a 1952 musical romance directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly starring him and Debbie Reynolds. I think I speak in the name of countless when I say that two of the most important factors in my life are my passion for movies and my love for music. Not only do I happen to be a passionate stage actor and musician myself, both have played a major role since I was a kid and there's nothing more moving for me than the rawest and purest output of emotions. That's why I think that I was literally born for the genre musical - in both watching and performing. In any way, having witnessed this classic was a revelation for me. From the first minute on, it grabbed me on a deep emotional level. There's no actor or actress in this feature whose ability to act, dance or sing isn't absolutely masterful. Kelly and Reynolds pretty much dominated the screen with their absolutely heartwarming chemistry. It's a colourful piece or art that perfectly manages to amaze the audience with it's uplifting story that realistically depicts a time in the history of cinema when talking films were said to never make it in Hollywood - and at the same time subliminally criticises it. It's a touching story that perfectly balances well written and crafted scenes or dialogue and drama with ingenious and non-repetitive musical numbers. They all fit so well in the atmosphere of their respective scenes and (except for one in the end) had me on the edge of my seat and in a form of indescribable ecstasy. What I experienced there was classic acting at it's finest. The songs and musical score are absolutely loveable and unforgettable and the titular number has been stuck in my head for hours since I watched it. The magnificent camera work enables the viewer to literally live every scene on such a close level that everyone who feels in a bad mood before watching it will feel immensely better afterwards. It's the sheer amount of talent and the perfectionist directorial style of the director duo that make this film almost reach perfection and so much inspiring in so many ways. All in all, it's outstanding as it is iconic, still untouchable and the forerunner for every musical that comes after. Even in modern standards this one still beats every film in direct competition. I'm pretty sure that when you look up the term 'musical' in a lexicon you will find an image of Gene Kelly dancing around a streetlight pool and singing one of the most famous numbers of all time. No matter how I felt today, I can't help but repeat what he's singing over and over again. It cheered me up and made me see rain in a way more positive way. 'I'm dancing ... and singing in the rain.' - and literally feel this. Thank Hollywood this films exists!",9,1,1,28 February 2020
Mama," Mama, I didn't mean to make you cry
","'Mama' is a 2013 horror film directed by Andy Muschietti starring Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. A few years before Argentinian novice director more or less successfully helmed both remake adaptations of the classic Stephen King novel 'IT' and became known to a broader audience, he kind of acquired renown within the genre with his quite popular yet not really successful full length feature debut. I personally heard a lot of things about it, most of them being positive and to know that Guillermo Del Toro produced this film made me believe it to be true. To be honest, after seeing images and short sequences of the trailer when I was actually not allowed to see it (thanks to German advertisement) I was scared to watch it at all, although I'm sure that I've probably seen even worse by now, but what am I to say? Childhood fears stick with you for a while against all rationality. Regardless, I took my courage in both hands and had the guts to give it a watch, although I admittedly was about to abort mission already during the menu. Turns out though, that the scenes that are shown during this short sequence are already the creepiest scenes and sadly the only highlights. Even if this flick is far from being abysmal, it still has several undeniable flaws that disturb the overall experience. First, I personally could not believe Chastain in her emo punk goth chick role with the black dyed hair and tattoos, it seemed extremely insincere to me and far away from credible. It appeared to be more of a masquerade than anything that fits to an actual fictional personality to me and sadly lacked the authenticity that keeps it from appearing unintentionally hilarious, but the more the film proceeded, the more I astonishingly grew accustomed to it, solely thanks to Chastain's talent and the effort she has put into this role and it is those factors that make it tolerable to a certain degree. Next to this, the film started out in a promising way and put some effort in building up a specific atmosphere, but the more the film moved on the less packing it became. While I was on the verge of covering my face with my blanket in the beginning, it was nowhere near it in the end, because the films suspense curved dropped gradually. How does this happen? Well, it is happening when you have a genuinely scary entity but don't know how to deal with it properly. What I mean is the simple fact that Mama was way creepier when she was only implied and not actually visible on screen. Aware of the fact that she was not completely computer animated and played by an actual actor, the phenomenal Javier Botet, gave it some extra vehemence to it, yet is doesn't change the fact that its full potential hasn't been used in the slightest. Nevertheless, the camera work and especially the use of long shots out of a hidden camera angle created some dense atmosphere, as it suggested that the audience is watching the helpless protagonist and also some subliminally effective scares that are only thrown in by the way also help building up the atmosphere immensely. Why did it go wrong then? The answer is monotony. After it used this certain formula for a few times it became repetitive and hence lost the threatening power it used to have in the beginning and became boringly predictable. The only reason I still flinched at some scenes was simply due to the fact that the sound mixing was extremely unbalanced, in other words the dialogue was mostly quiet and almost inaudible, which is why I turned up the volume multiple times while the scenes you are supposed to jump off your seat at are extremely loud by nature. I'm aware that this a common practice in horror films, but those scenes in here weren't that intimidating that I'd consider them to be jump scares at all. In this case it's more of a cheap trick to compensate the lack of originality and factual horror. In addition to that, the story also did not do much about keeping the atmosphere intact and thus mistreated the promising exposition immensely. Sadly, the plot really does not flesh out the personality and background story of Mama enough and scratches on the very surface only. They could have gone way deeper into the historical aspect of the story, explored the human background of what Mama eventually became develop her personality and motivations of her haunting more. Instead, we only get a brief insight into her past without any further explanation. It is only just enough but could have been way more interesting and that is kind of frustrating. They even mention and define the meaning of a ghost and how it is the pure manifestation of extreme feelings, yet they don't explain her emotionality enough to make it completely comprehensible. It is not like that they leave it out completely, but it just doesn't feel right to me, it is simply not enough for me personally. Furthermore, there are some plot decisions that don't really fit into the story. Next to the uselessness of Mama showing Annabel her backstory (there was actually no need for her to know, only for the audience) the character of Luke is actually pointless for the story as well. The meaning he has in the story is that he is the cool uncle, but aside from this he is useless for the story as well and the dream or vision he has also doesn't bring anything important to the further scenes. It is no surprise that the character constellation somehow reminded me of the 'Silent Hill' movie, because like said title this film also is about maternal bonds (who would have guessed it with that title?) and this is the only thing that gives some personality to Mama, as it characterizes her basic motivations. She is inherently not hostile, but extremely protective and jealous in her own way. With the sadly way too short but enough glimpse at her backstory I even felt bad for her in some way, as it explains her endless spook. That is why I absolutely don't understand the final climax. In my humble opinion, her haunting as well as the film should have ended after she was reunited with the remains of what used to be the baby she accidentally killed. Not only would it have been metaphorical and concluded the films symbolism, it would have rounded up the film in a pleasant way as well, as she found her humanity again. But it doesn't end there. Instead, she makes the same mistake again by throwing her infants bones over the cliff again and tries to claim the child she is aware of isn't rightfully hers. After that moment, my sympathy for her vanished immediately, because all those actions contradict her role as a victim and make her the perpetrator instead. The desired redemption I hoped to see was bitterly tainted after this. Having had a discussion with her afterwards, my mother on the other hand disagreed with me, as she thinks that Lilly never would have had the chance to reintegrate into society and that the only way for her to find peace was to go with the only mother figure she has ever had, but it did not feel right to me. That is only a proof how deeply divided the opinions about the same topic might be. I guess the reason why my Mom understood the ending differently is that she is a mother herself, an interpersonal relationship I will never experience myself. She comprehends it on a level I can only imagine, and it think that's an interesting point of view. All in all, this horror drama has the correct approaches, but the execution lacks the innovation that its premise promised it to be. While scary in the beginning, it progressively became less and less scary and more and more repetitive in its repertoire of scares. Aside from a few illogical things and obvious discrepancies it managed to offer a mediocre and minimally atmospheric experience. While it is far from being outstanding or memorable, it knows to entertain the audience in a cheap way. Could have been more but even worse at the same time.",6,0,0,30 April 2020
Super 8," Supernatural coming of age story
","'Super 8' is a 2011 mystery thriller directed by J.J. Abrams starring Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning. This movie and I have shared a history together, even if I watched for the first time today. I still remember how I went on a field trip in school and this film was planned to be broadcasted on TV. I was encouraged to watch it with my class mates, but in the end, I was the only one who didn't watch it, simply due to the fact that I was chicken hearted as hell back in then and suddenly decided against it. That's why it was a strange moment for me to finally give it a watch today, with my sisters that are now the same age I was back then and to see that things have come full circle in some way. It wasn't even as bad as I heard, as many complained about the film's nature. To be honest, it's sorta misleading. What else but a masterpiece would you have expected from a Spielberg production in form of an alien film? Another 'Close Encounters Of The Third Kind'? Another 'E.T.'? Well, maybe, but remember it's basically an Abrams directed movie. What I immediately realized is that the film is no horror film in the first place, but a coming of age story of eight Ohio small town teenagers trying to make it as a film crew that is coincidentally drawn into the supernatural situation. The film's greatest achievement is how it successfully managed to bring a loveable group of friends to the big screen that stands out even in comparison to the adult actors. Even though he only functions as a producer, the Spielberg type of magic is palpable between the characters. They all also perform on a decent level, but Elle Fanning is terrific in here! She's one of my favourite actresses and really impressed me again, as she's shining in every scene she's in. It fits decently into the atmosphere of the film that's more children friendly mystery thriller than an alien horror flick. Nevertheless, one of the most prominent flaws of this flick are the run time and story development. It's stretching it's substance way too much and this sorta disturbs a consistent and well paced buildup of suspense. Aside from that, it's not overall scary and the design of the alien isn't quite frightening, but it definitely has some unexpected medium level brutality in it that hits if you constantly remind yourself that it's a children suitable film in the first place. It wasn't the most brutal thing I've ever seen in a film, but I personally still felt totally nervous at times, cause I always tried to see it from the perspective of my teenaged sisters who sat next to me and possibly might find it too scary. Considering this, I was unintentionally thrilled at times together with them and I think that was an advantage, as I was able to see it as if I was a member of the target audience. Furthermore, as it's known from a Spielberg production, it also had a family conflict elaborated in it, a story of loss, grieving and letting go and the final scene with the necklace was heartwarming, least to say. All in all, this flick is more of a supernatural drama than a horror film and definitely plays a significant role as a coming of age film for young adults to learn from. While it has a nice concept, it could have focused more on the flair of it's time, but still manages to entertain decently. It's a promising formula that's already shown there that, if it was perfectly executed, might be iconic and, in my opinion, eventually hit the screen as the famous Netflix show 'Stranger Things'. It's a fun watch, go in it without expecting too much.",7,0,1,25 February 2020
Don't Breathe," Alvarez made some things you won't see coming...
","'Don't Breathe' is a 2016 horror thriller directed by Fede Alvarez starring Jane Levy and Stephen Lang. In the first few minutes I was bothering my head about where I know the lead actress from and after I could not find a solution to my overthinking, I paused it and had to look it up. After this short break I found out that I knew her from 'Evil Dead' and furthermore realised that this film was produced by the team behind said remake (e.g. Sam Raimi) and even was directed by the same director as well. Then I knew I was in for something for some hard stuff. Surprisingly, this film is the total opposite of the gore fest that the remake is and went into a more realistic and thriller type of horror film instead. Afterwards I learned that Alvarez came up with the idea for this film on the basis of the heavy criticism he received for his previous feature, mostly for the fact that he allegedly used only gallons of blood to shock the audience. Therefore he came up with the idea for this film and I think he successfully proved that he is capable of doing something completely different as well. The film's concept is basically simple: Teenagers break into an old man's house to steal his hidden fortune. Sounds simple? It is, but one may justifiably ask: How does the horror come into the picture then? The horror in this case is something you will not see coming at all. I wasn't either. I was mildly underwhelmed but simultaneously heavily impressed that the film passed on using any form of paranormal or supernatural horror and approaches its premise with extreme realism instead. It is mostly created by the haunting tension and the characters' constant fear of getting caught that also gradually begins to infest the viewer as well. All of this happens due to the development of both the characters and the story. Speaking of which, the main characters are one of the main reasons of this movie's success, because you can't really tell who plays what role. The three burglars might be the apparent protagonists of the film, but there are some major reasons that make it extremely hard to consider them the heroes of the story. Even though their motivation to rob a man is the simple desire to leave their hometown of Detroit and especially their dysfunctional families and start a new life from the money they are hoping to heist, it doesn't change the fact that they are illegally stealing from a blind, old war veteran who received the money as a settlement from people who killed his only beloved daughter in a car accident. Thus, the definition of who is the hero and who is the villain is in limbo in the beginning and I think how it deals with this question in the process is one of the film's most brilliant aspects. It is undeniable that the actions of Rocky and company are morally questionable and are obviously not the right solution for their problem, but it is hard to judge them completely, given their current troubled life situation. In a weird way it makes them authentic and human. Except for that complete moron Money, I felt extreme sympathy for both Rocky and Alex. The same applies to the blind man with no mentioned name. Imagine you served your country and return scarred and marked from combat and the only real joy in your life is the close relationship to your only daughter who eventually dies in a car accident and the only thing that is supposed to compensate her life is an enormous amount of money. Just imagine that is what is left of your miserable life and then some greedy teenagers try to steal that from you as well. Wouldn't you be upset about this as well? As written in stone as it may sound, the film ingeniously manages to let this conception crumble with enough shocking twists and your perception about all the characters shifts immensely in the process. The story is another of the film's biggest advantages. Despite the absence of any paranormal threat, it definitely doesn't lack the tension that is needed in this kind of movie and it undoubtedly takes a lot of creativity to create a certain suspense in such a limited setting all the while trying to stay true to the intended realism. The outcome is without a doubt appreciable. What I feared to see was the lack of inventiveness, but this film fortunately is anything but repetitive (except for a few aspects) and hauntingly rich in variety and thus offers a lot of innovation for this genre. Another thing that makes this film differ from other entries it is how it allows the threat to only creep in slowly. In the beginning I was thinking 'What kind of damage might a blind and old man probably do to three healthy teenagers with a gun?' and it shocked me what this man could do despite of his disadvantage. Not only does he have a canine companion that does a lot of work for him, the house the three trespassers are trapped in is still his own territory after all. He learned to live in it despite his missing vision. Just like our protagonist I underestimated his hidden abilities and thus he is an actual threat. The film mostly follows Rocky, superbly portrayed by Jane Levy, and focuses on her as she tries to remain silent and find a way out of the death trap. Like in her first collaboration with Alvarez, she is one of the main factors why this film works out so well. Once again, she shows how talented she is and especially masters the eye game again. Her performance impressively captures the silent terror of this flick and thus brings the horror into effect, in other words, it made me hold my breath for most of the runtime. In the following sequences her fight for survival is the focus and there are several ideas incorporated that exacerbate the whole situation tremendously. Just before you thought she is on the brink of finally escaping her certain death there is something else that thwarts her flight and traps her even more in the house. It is not only the whole atmosphere, but also the antagonist that heavily reminded me of 'Resident Evil 7' and gave me similar vibes. In some instances, it was sadly predictable and kept me from being surprised, but aside from this it had enough unforeseen features that made it up for it (two words: night vision!). Next to the striking resemblance to the 2017 Koshi Nakanishi game it also pays tribute to classic horror films, such as 'Cujo' (obviously) and supposedly even 'The Silence Of The Lambs' (can't tell it in the case of the latter, still have to see it), but allegedly the final reveal is not inferior to the Johnathan Demme classic in terms of how disturbing it is. The blind man keeping the girl who killed his daughter as a hostage and forcing her to bear him a new child? Whatever the director was smoking lead him to a decision that is nothing short of absolutely gross and had an unsettling effect on me. The fact that his behaviour and desperate measures made sense in an insane way didn't make it easier for me. With this devastating realization the movie gains even more tension, as the inconspicuous and innocent man turns out to be an even more dangerous and indescribably threatening maniac. Until the end, he doesn't seem to be willing to stop until he is getting what he desires. Even after the bloodcurdling final act where is defeated and presumably dead, he turns out to be still alive. That leaves me wondering if he is human or actually not something more instead. Another thing I consider to be remarkable is how Rocky managed to escape with the stolen money and starts a new life on a undeniably nefarious basis. Stolen money remains to be stolen money, no matter what kind of pervert is the legitimate owner. It is interesting how the finale subtly establishes her as an antihero and convicts neither the protagonist nor the antagonist for their felonies and thus places both on the same level. Just a small detail, but not less brilliant. All in all, this flick is a surprisingly innovative and intense thriller that establishes its horror with a realistic approach and passes on paranormal factor completely. Admittedly, the film did not impress that much shortly after the credits have rolled, but the more I thought about it the more I was able to take in the ingeniousness that lies out of sight but in hidden details. Furthermore, I enjoyed the character constellation and the personalities behind each and everyone and consider Jane Levy's performance to be a critical factor for this film's success (aside from the dog who is the real MVP) and it makes me kind of sad that she is not starring in any bigger films. In my opinion, she absolutely deserves more recognition. This film is without a doubt original, innovative, and packing, in other words everything a movie of that genre needs. It was indeed a creative venture, but it eventually pays off, as it turns out to be something of its own. Oh, and before I forget: Now that I have seen both Levy/Alvarez collaborations and felt strong 'Resident Evil' vibes in both, I think it would be a perfect job for him to make a proper adaptation with Levy in the leading role, as she would make an ideal Jill Valentine. With Raimi as the producer, a man who is experienced in this genre and a talented and charismatic lead actress, what could go wrong then? It surely could not be worse than the Anderson abominations. Just saying. Anyway, this film might not be ground-breaking, but is a surprisingly entertaining and decent thriller.",7,1,1,4 May 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Hermione and the Beast
","'Beauty and the Beast' is a 2017 musical romance directed by Bill Condon starring Emma Watson and Dan Stevens. Upon its release, I had mixed feelings about the idea of a live action remake of one of my favourite childhood films. We can all argue what's the point of a remake, but an adaptation that seems to be exactly like the original film? I can not deny that I still consider this one and the other remakes as unnecessary and money driven projects. But since yesterday was a promised movie night with my little sister and I don't have anything suitable for her in my shelf, she chose this one from her own. Honestly, it was not as bad as I expected. The biggest benefit from this movie is the pompous style and colorful costume design. The film crew literally managed to transfer the the magic and splendor of the animated flick on to the big screen. Additionally, every character was casted perfectly and as I expected, each and everyone delivered greatly. Next to this, I was glad that they still included the original songs. It's also notable that they also added a few new details to the tale as old as time, some derived from the original fairy tale, some completly new. Although it may not sound like it, the film also had a few flaws: The design of the beast appeared a bit to harmless to me and most of the most dramatic scenes of the original film (the wolves fighting scene, the showdown on the roof) lacked the emotional depth and dramatic essence they had before. I'm aware that they had to change it, because they targeted a younger audience and it would have been way to brutal to make it so packing, but I still think a little more tension would not have destroyed the concept. The visual effects and performances make it up a bit at least. All in all, this remake still might be unnecessary, but it's highly enjoyable for both, the young and the old generation, and delivers great fun from start to finish. It doesn't want to achieve anything else and was mostly made for a younger audience and as I saw my sister smiling the whole time, I knew that I was right. Watchable, but it definitely doesn't outshine the original.",7,1,1,24 November 2019
Pretty Woman," Money rules the world
","'Pretty Woman' is a 1990 romance directed by Garry Marshall starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. Romantic comedies can be entertaining if they offer enough originality and are able to distance themselves from all the clichés and stereotypes that make the genre so infamously embarrassing. There's always the same pattern that's used in almost all of them and that's why it's so hard to find seriously entertaining romances. In this case, it doesn't make an exception. First of all, I personally don't think that Richard Gere is a great actor, because probably no character has bothered me less before. He might be charming for some and even handsome (even as a straight male I don't think he is), but what bothered me the most was that he barely gave his character any depth. There was no emotion and he literally had the same face over the whole run time and has not even succeeded once to convince me once. To be honest, it was surely terrible. The score would be a lot worse if it wasn't for his counterpart, the lovely Julia Roberts. The best aspect about this somewhat forgettable flick is her ingenious portrayal of Vivian Ward and her contagious happiness. It's not only that, she had so many dimensions to her character and it developed almost perfectly in the end. She almost makes it up for what her on screen partner failed to convey. Next to this, the screenplay mostly lacks both the perfect pace and the ability to convince me that the leading actors are in love. It's full of clichés and kitsch and doesn't offer any interesting turns. It consequently stays on the same, tiring level and even a supporting role of the great Ralph Bellamy can't compensate this mess. Their on screen romance is extremely unconvincing and I actually didn't believe him that she is more than a hooker to her. With the soundtrack it's a two-edged sword, at times it fits perfectly with the tone and then it's completely misused and hard to watch. The film combines excellence and terribleness and the latter prevails. In the end, it did nothing that shocked me, it was predictable from the beginning and it's sad to see that it didn't even try to give trouble to create something that no one would expect. But this would probably destroy the beloved happy end, doesn't it? All in all, this flick is a mess that obviously suffers from the curse of its genre and doesn't entertain a bit, except for a great Julia Roberts who probably played the role of her life. Aside from this, there's nothing original in it that I would consider worth a rewatch. Not for all the roses in the world. And what's even the moral of the story? People only treat you with respect when you're rich and have money? I don't think that's the correct message to convey the audience, especially young women...",5,0,1,6 January 2020
The Descent," A surreal allegory and infernal hell trip at the same time
","'The Descent' is a 2005 horror film directed by Neil Marshall starring Shauna Macdonald and Natalie Mendoza. I generally love it when films manage to become successful, even though their budget is heavily restricted. Money isn't always everything, sometimes I watch movies that have obtained a utopian funding and ended up as nothing but hot garbage (I am looking at you, Michael Bay), on the other side I am extremely fascinated that some gems prove the total opposite and show that pure creativity is everything a film needs. May it be Kevin Smith's minimalistic comedy hit 'Clerks' that works simply due to its brilliant screenplay or a found footage film like 'The Blair Witch Project' that solely lives from the horror it creates in our heads, low budget doesn't always mean lower quality. While this horror flick has had a little more money in it pocket than the previously mentioned flicks (approximately Â£3.5 million, to be exact), it is still a meagre amount to work with. Hence it is so surprisingly pleasant to see what a decent film the outcome in case of this flick is. First, it is fascinating to see that it is not only a horror film that's sole purpose is to show of some jump scares and frighten the audience, but also offers a subliminal deeper meaning that gives the film a haunting ambiguity to it. Honestly, I haven't seen this film before, but already a few minutes into the movie I told my brother about my theory and he just sat there and said 'Yes...', wondering that I figured it out so fast, but the fact that my brain once again overanalysed the film didn't make it any less packing, if anything, it made it even better for me. The film starts out with a traumatic experience and it was obvious that it wasn't only filmed to make the film longer, it has a deep meaning that will overshadow the remaining progress of the film immensely. Protagonist Sarah is the one who lost both her husband and daughter in a fatal car accident and suffers from depression ever since. While it is not explicitly mentioned by any character, it is still sort of evident, as she is seen taking pills and also the fact that the first half of the film is almost exclusively captured in cold blue shades support this assumption. This is without a doubt one of the most brilliant aspects of this movie, but before we go deeper into it (pun intended), there are also a few things that I was dissatisfied with. On the one hand, it was extremely trying for me to find some sort of connection to any of the characters, as the film doesn't do enough about introducing them properly, on the other hand the character constellation was tremendously confusing, especially in the cave scenes, that I had severe difficulties to distinguish between them all. The lack of sympathy for the ladies even got to the point that I was more annoyed rather than actually caring for them. The fact that they are characterized as what Lily and Robin would call 'Woo-Girls' made them unlikable, to the point that I sat there and jokingly begged for someone to kill them. It indeed was pretty hard to not dislike them all and that's such a pity, as the only halfway likable character of them all was our troubled protagonist Sarah. Sadly, the focus doesn't lie on her the way I hoped it would and she is pushed in the background most of the time in favour of concentrating on her unsympathetic friends instead. This procedure was continued for most of the runtime, I even forgot her name in a few situations. For a main character that is pretty sad. Only when there were two or three of them left, it was easy to follow them, in other words, it was way too late. Even when I disliked this undeniable major flaw, it did not keep me from having a good time, as the horror in this film is simply superb. The way it is only introduced slowly makes it work out so well and stand out in its own way. To be honest, if I haven't already known about the fact that this film belongs to the horror genre, it easily could have been a survival drama as well, but thanks to advertising and the fact that is a fifteen years old classic of that same genre, I was spared from this unexpected genre twist. This doesn't change the fact that the film indeed managed to scare the hell out of me. As previously mentioned, the fear is only induced gradually. Most of the horror in the beginning takes place via sounds and brief shots of what turns out to be the horrid danger and only introduces its monster after it has been messing with our heads for a while. The so-called 'Crawlers', as they are named only in the credits, are genuinely creepy and the mere fact that they are humanoid creatures and that their origin isn't explained in the slightest, adds a lot of thrill to the atmosphere. Also, that those monsters are anything but invincible and have a distinct weakness to them (blindness) makes the film tremendously unpredictable. Thus, it is still offering the possibility for the characters to escape and find a way out, instead of making it appear that it is their certain death for them in the first place. Furthermore, it offers enough other aspects and ideas that kept me on the edge of my seat. Next to the closeup shots of the leading ladies crawling through the most narrow fissures that triggered my own claustrophobia even when I wasn't in the situation myself, the different colour schemes that gave each scenario an undeniably packing feeling to it make it even better. Oh, and let's not forget to mention the graphic violence and blood. The scene where they try to fix Holly's open fracture? Almost made me throw up! There are also several other sequences that use the gore factor of this film eminently well, but the best scenes are the ones when the film makes use of the main feature of its antagonistic creatures. When this one crawler literally steps on the head of the motionless Sarah after she killed off the female one in the pool of blood? I literally freaked out! As gruesome and promising the killings started out, after more than two deaths took place in quite the same manner, it became less shocking than before and the deaths of those two who were killed before Juno and Sarah become the only ones left alive (I actually don't remember their names at all) were repetitive, lacked the innovation of the demises depicted before and on top of that, were utterly stupid. I mean, what did she try to achieve by climbing? She even checked it out other ways and knew that there was water at the bottom of the gorge. Why didn't she try it? It was probably necessary so that Sarah could confront Juno about the apparent affair of her with her late husband. After she has killed her former best friend, we get to the most interesting part of the film: the ending. Ignoring the existence of the sequel that presumes that she actually made it out of the cave, I personally think that she died down there eventually. If we consider that the things that are depicted in this film actually happened, she died down there in the cave by the hands of those supernatural monsters, but I prefer to see the whole thing metaphorically: As I mentioned before, the film is just a brutal allegory of Sarah's fight with depression. The whole spelunking adventure with her friends resembles her deteriorating mental health and her friends trying to help her through it and the crawlers are the incarnation of depressive thoughts that try to kill her and distance her from her friends. I mean, they are killed off one by one, the arrows on the wall all contradict themselves and Sarah is the final character to be alive and only after she learned that her husband cheated on her with her best friend she totally accepts that she is going to die. With seemingly no one there to help her anymore, she embraces her fate and is letting it happen. Even though it is not explicitly shown or mentioned, my theory is that she commits suicide in the end after giving up the fight. Regardless of whether you see it as just a gore horror film or an allegory for her struggle, in the end the film draws a devastatingly depressing conclusion in both ways. In terms of filmmaking it is absolutely brilliant, but as a subject matter it indescribably sad. All in all, this subterranean and surreal film is an ambiguous hell trip through all sorts of emotions and the ferocity of depression and offers enough as both a pure gore fest and as an allegory to keep the viewer on the edge of their seats. Even though the characters are shallow and unlikeable, and the film lacks the factor of shock in the end, it still manages to entertain and create a nightmarish atmosphere. It indeed is a gem, flawed but not less brilliant, and deservedly bears the title of being one of the finest and most original British horror films of all time. I don't know about you, but I will never go anywhere near to a cave, let alone entering one. It is enough for me to watch a bunch of girls do this for me on screen. This already gives me enough anxiety.",7,0,0,16 May 2020
It's a Wonderful Life," Life is wonderful
","'It's A Wonderful Life' is a 1946 drama directed by Frank Capra starring James Stewart and Donna Reed. Just as 'Die Hard' belongs to Christmas Eve, this all time favourite belongs to the first day of Christmas. While the first one is still arguable, no one can deny that this Capra classic is the best Christmas film of all time. Not only is it featured or referenced in literally ever other holiday flick, it's the epitome of Christmas spirit. Even if you haven't been in the mood before, this film will get you right into it. Saying it's perfect still feels like an understatement to me. I hands down can't find anything that I'd consider as a flaw. It's flawless, least to say. With every year I get older, I get more and more into the phenomenally written narration about the life of a man who struggles balancing his personal dreams and his moral obligations. James Stewart acts brilliantly in this and I'd consider George Bailey as probably his best performance of all time. It's an outstandingly scripted drama, well paced and extremely detailed in its narrative structure. The dialogue and the characters downright brim over with originality and personality, the constellations between them are eminently well elaborated and enable the viewer to feel with each and everyone of them immensely. Although the film runs for roughly two hours it always felt like a three hour epic, but not even in a negative way. What the film furthermore managed to capture magnificently is the essence of the drama. One can literally feel the inner conflict of George when he over and over decides against his dreams and his desires in favour of what others expect him to do and what he feels obligated to do. In so many scenes, this everlasting conflict finds it's way back in and reminds him of his own misery. That's how the whole situation builds up to the final act. It's all sensitively narrated and although many consider it so, never becomes a bit cheesy. Also, it has a lot of classic metaphors and a prominent symbolism in it, particularly the scene when George throws a stone in the window of the old abandoned house. He wished for his dreams to come true, when Mary tosses her's she wishes for him to be with her forever. This is the exact moment when everything he's planned slowly begins to fall apart. It's scenes like these that make the amateur writer in my so happy, it's just a master class of a screenplay. But after all this drama, I'm glad that they decided to go in a more uplifting direction in the end and worship life instead of condemning it. No matter what, the final scene gives me goosebumps every single time. All in all, this drama is a masterpiece and a textbook example of a timeless classic, with both an excellent story and magnificent performances that will hit you right in the feels and remind you that life is the most precious gift of them all. It tells us that it's okay to sometimes be unhappy and struggle with serious issues, because in the end we are not alone and all have friends and family even if it doesn't seem so. Sometimes we feel less important than we actually are to our beloved ones, but we are never alone. Having said this, merry Christmas and remember: You are being loved!",10,0,0,26 December 2019
The Departed," The rat symbolises obviousness!
","'The Departed' is a 2006 crime thriller directed by Martin Scorsese starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. As the annual birthday feature I decided on Scorsese's mid two thousand gem. It's a rewatch for me, as I already watched it back in November of 2017 and I still can feel how much this day has impacted me and my always developing taste in films. It's Scorsese, isn't that enough said? While there also many people who just don't resonate with his films, I'm definitely considering myself a great admirer of his work. I always knew that when Scorsese makes a film it's gonna be nothing short of cinematic art. This one's not quite different. First of all, he assembled one of the greatest casts and uses extremely talented actors even in the smallest roles. From terrific central performances by DiCaprio and Damon, there's an absolutely crazy performance by Jack Nicholson who dominates every single scene he's in. This man is without a doubt one of the most talented actors of all time and appearing in this film only confirms his status as an absolute legend. The supporting contributions by Sheen, Farmiga and Wahlberg are also not to bee scoffed at and also on an tremendously genius level. As to expect from a Scorsese feature, the whole final product is pure art by all accounts. Based on the Chinese classic feature 'Mou Gaan Dou (Infernal Affairs)' he managed to relocate the story in the wonderful and brutal streets of Boston and it doesn't lack the tension a film of this genre needs. The story is without a doubt a masterful construct that even more masterfully combines its plot lines with such unique brilliance. It's basically a simple idea elaborated to such a sophisticated and packing plot. Two moles from two different parties try to identify each other all the while trying not to be uncovered. This duality is kept until the very end and even when the film already starts with this specific feeling of threat, it's becoming increasingly more and more as the film goes on. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Scorsese doubles it and blows your mind again. The character constellation is what makes this formula work out so extremely well. From start to finish it's not one hundred percent sure who's a friend and who's a foe, everyone has their own secrets and hidden role. Who can you trust? While we as the audience know about some characters and their role in this construct, we're still surprised nevertheless about some revelations. The triangular relationship between the two moles and the same woman is only one of the weak spots about this whole concept of trust and paranoia. The runtime might seem a little long, but in direct comparison to some of the director's other works, he uses every single second wisely and actually never slows it down or makes it boring. The tension doesn't decline once and until the shocking ending, had me on the edge of my seat. It wouldn't work out though if it wasn't for the ingenious cinematography and brilliant editing that create this packing atmosphere in the first place. All in all, this film is hands down one of the best thriller of the two thousands and effortlessly ranks among my favourite Scorsese flicks. It's an interesting gangster take with enough shocking twists and unraveled secrets that keep the film from getting boring, not even once it made me lose attention. In the end, nobody wins in this merciless game of trust and I think that's the crushing message behind it that makes it so subliminally epic. Well crafted, well acted and just highly enjoyable to witness. One of his best, that's for sure, but some other films of his filmography even better than this one. To conclude my review with the words of Ralph Wiggum: The rat symbolizes obviousness!",9,0,0,20 April 2020
Die Hard," Welcome to best action movie of all time, pal!
","'Die Hard' is a 1988 action film directed by John McTiernan starring Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. As the popular meme states, there are people who think this action classic is a Christmas movie and people who are wrong. Since its original release (as it was told me) this film has been the only choice for the perfect Christmas Eve in my family. A few years have passed since I joined this tradition and immediately fell in love with it - and even now it's the highlight of the day to me. It doesn't only enjoy cult status because people watch it during the most wonderful time of the year and feel great thanks to it, it's a cinematic masterpiece that's near perfect. With the beginning shots, the atmosphere begins to set in immediately. The best of it all are the plot and the screenplay: Not only are there iconic protagonists, each and every supporting character has a well designed personality and plays a major part in the story. Additionally, it's perfectly paced and keeps a packing tension every single second, mostly due to the extreme ingenuity of the writers. It might take place in a limited area, but still delivers a powerful and far-reaching experience. From bombastic and realistic explosions to intelligent shootouts, the film develops a scenario that never becomes boring. It offers enough variety and lives from its love for detail, thus enabling the viewer to dive in the situation completly. John McClane, the sarcastic anti hero is getting along perfectly with the calculated and cold antagonist Hans Gruber (brilliantly played by the late legend Alan Rickman). It's always a great joy to see how they fight each other verbally and in the end face to face. Thanks to outstanding editing and a ingenious sound score the buildup to the final showdown is always a treat for a perfectionst like me. In most instances it feels like a video game I'll never get the chance to play myself and that's always a sad realisation. All in all, this action film is the perfect film for Christmas Eve and ranks high up in the list of the best Christmas films of all time (only a certain Frank Capra film is better) and will always be a part of my tradition. It never gets bad or ages badly, even more than 30 years after it hit the big screen it's way better than most of the blockbusters of our modern cinema. Often copied but never reached, it will forever remain on the top spot of action films. To me, Christmas can only begin when I see Hans Gruber fall of the Nakatomi Plaza. Otherwise it's not Christmas.",10,2,2,25 December 2019
Psycho," 'A boy's best friend is his mother'
","'Psycho' (OV) is a 1960 horror thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock starring Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles. There aren't many old films that are still relevant decades after their release, but if there's one it's definitely this thriller. It's the textbook example of suspense and classic horror and in terms of excellence still unreached. It's known that Hitchcock was way ahead of his time and it really shows. How many other films from the early sixties start with a woman only seen in her bra? Also the shower scene shows a lot of nudity compared to the standards of that time. It really shows how daring the director was in his directorial style. To be honest, it all was for the better. The film may have a longer first act that introduces us to a side character, but simultaneously he tricks us into thinking that Marion Crane is the protagonists and makes her death (one of the best scenes) shocking and gives it even more momentum. But in the context of the whole film the storytelling is absolutely well paced and never loses it's perfectly balanced level. Additionally, the virtuoso score by Bernard Herrmann, probably the epitome of suspense, supports the overall enthralling atmosphere from start to finish, sinks it's teeth into your head and won't let you go until the film has ended. The most notable thing about this film though is Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates. I've never seen such an incredible performance, he perfectly masters every single character trait of his disturbed nature, as he plays both the shy and somehow insecure manger of a motel and the insane and malicious psychopath, with a strange and oedipal relationship towards his mother, with such excellence. To be honest, this is one the best representations I've seen in my entire life that personally inspires me as an aspiring actor. Just the way he manages to dominate a scene for almost 15 minutes without saying a word, only with his mimics and charisma are enough to prove my thesis. Also the final stare into the camera in the end literally gave me goosebumps. Besides this one-man show, the supporting actors still deliver great work nevertheless, but Perkins stole everyone's show. With unusual camera angles the director thoroughly captures the haunting atmosphere of the horrifying story. Next to iconic scenes, the final twist is one of the most magnificent conclusions of all time. All in all, this horror classic is as outstanding as it's claimed. It combines all, a packing plot, a haunting atmosphere and superb actin and in the end, I sat there with tremendous joy and awe. A day later, I still think about how awesome it is. An unforgettable experience of pure excellence that you won't forget. This is one of the many reasons I love my hobby!",10,1,1,9 October 2019
The Witch," Atmospheric, authentic and utterly terrifying
","'The VVitch: A New-England Folktale' is a 2015 horror drama directed by Robert Eggers starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Ralph Ineson. I experienced it firsthand that the movies of independent label A24 are somewhat peculiar in their style and far away from being the mainstream friendly features that pleases every single moviegoer. As of today, it is still a hit or miss for me, as I dearly love a few titles, some being unexpected surprises, but on the other hand also got a few titles that just don't resonate with me at all. May it be the utterly underwhelming psychological horror hit 'Midsommar', a surprisingly intriguing crime drama like 'Spring Breakers' or an innovative coming of age drama such as 'Lady Bird', my opinions about the films of this production company differ wildly. It is not only in my case, the most unconventional titles seem to divide the whole viewership in general, sometimes I hear two totally opposite thoughts on the same movie. In the case of this film, this theory proves to be correct and happens to be a fact even in my own social circle. My classmate, who recommended this film to me and brought it to my attention, considers this film to be one of the scariest films she has ever seen and deeply loves it, on the other hand I have got my own parents who both agree that this film is a big snoozefest and think it is one of the most overrated horror films of all time. So, it is obvious that I didn't quite know what I should be expecting. I just went in with an open mind, and I got to say, it was undoubtedly an unconventional film, but I personally took a liking to it. What mostly stood out was the sheer authenticity of the whole production. From the contemporary setting over the costumes that are true to the depicted time, it all looks breathtakingly original, as if the crew travelled back in time and filmed an actual Puritan family and how they deal with their lives, but the thing that gives it the rest is the archaic language used in this film. Fortunately, I covered Shakespearean English and antique speech in my advanced course back in high school and surprisingly understood everything that has been said (given the fact that it is a foreign language to me, it was somewhat pleasing that I remember most of my education) and I think that was a strange but great experience. But of course, it isn't only this what makes this film so great. As I already implied before, the film's main focus lies on religion and especially Christianity. In the beginning, protagonist Thomasin and her family part ways with the colony they inhabited and start a life on their own in the wilderness, but once they arrived there, some scary things happen around them. It is indeed a simple premise and I understand why many might be bored by this, especially when the film itself is an extreme slow burner and horror fans that need everything to be graphic or to jump right in their faces are at the wrong address. The dread only creeps in slowly and one of the biggest factors why this film works out so alarmingly well to me is that it keeps up this certain kind of ambiguity until the very end. The baby all suddenly disappears, the brother returns from the wood and is visibly sick and no one seems to have an answer to that, except for the assumption that witches are after the family and that the devil himself has cursed them. The thing is, of course the members of the family try to explain the strange incidents reasonably (at least to a certain degree) and even though the film keeps up with the ambiguity and leaves it up to the viewer to decide whether everything is happening due to natural causes or to supernatural powers, the narration rather tends to go with the first option and tries to stay on the realistic way, but without excluding the other option completely. That makes it so unsettling throughout, as I didn't know what to believe in. Of course, there were several scenes that obviously depicted witches and their wicked actions, but all of them had this weirdness to them that made them appear like dream sequences or figments. They even could have been a part of a big metaphor. If you see the family leaving the colony as some form of banishment from the Garden of Eden and the aftermath as the struggle of surviving beyond the walls of paradise, the following things could be explained reasonably. The baby died of illness that resulted from the lack of comfort and Caleb got sick as well after got lost on his last hunting trip and the vanishing of the twins at the end of the movie also falls in the same category. People and children back in the day died comparatively quickly and when they had no explanation for what is happening, they scapegoated someone, mostly women, and accused them of being a witches. From a today's point of view, it of course is rubbish, but in this unenlightened time the easiest solution was also the correct solution. That is why I also think that the witches that are depict in some scenes could also be just a visual metaphor for this procedure to underline this paranoia. No matter what theory you believe in, the film itself has an indisputably unnerving atmosphere that never once let go of me. There was this invisible threat that haunts the family and even as the viewer I could not tell what the actual danger was. The fact that the film has shown some shots of the bordering forest for a few seconds from time to time without any connection to the actual context of the previous or following scene made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Like, it wanted to show us something with this, wanted to make us see that probably wasn't there. But what if? Even if I was just the one who watched the film while sitting on his couch, the film absorbed me completely and made me feel like I was in the film - and I felt constantly watched by something ... or someone. I mean, there was nothing shown explicitly, but still. The fact that I live near a forest and get a direct glimpse into the dark woods when I look out of my bedroom window made it even worse to me. Seriously, this film consumed me completely. Aside from the horror aspect, the film also contained a serious family drama that was shaped by paranoia, enviousness, and suspicion. To be honest, considering it was a family, it more seemed like they all hated each other with all their heart rather than loving each other, but that was the comprehension of family at that time, I think. They were stricter and more merciless in bringing up their children. Apart from this, most of the film also wouldn't work without the performances of the lead actors. Taylor-Joy is stunning and unpredictable in her feature film debut and carries most of the tension with her inscrutable innocence, Ineson is great in his role as the preaching family patriarch with the distinct bass voice and also Dickie's acting as the worried and grieving mother had something chilling to it. Believe it or not, the film hasn't even reached its final form of terror until the shocking finale. After each member of the haunted family, except for Thomasin, has been killed this way or another, it turns out that the witches actually exist in the context of the film. While it has been already subtly creepy before, the revelation that everything that has been going on throughout the whole film was indeed a result from supernatural forces makes it utterly terrifying retrospectively. I mean, they were in fact haunted and constantly watched by the witches living in the wood, right next to them and that sent shivers down my spine. At a moment's notice it destroys the illusion that everything that has happened was due to natural causes and that shocked me profoundly. The fact that the devil himself has been amongst them the whole time shines a whole new light on the religious meaning behind the film and subliminally confirms that evil exists ... while God doesn't. I mean, in the beginning, Thomasin prays to God and asks for salvation from her and her family's sins, but who shows up in the end? Who answers? It is superb how the film that focuses on the Christianity of its protagonists eventually subliminally draws the atheistic conclusion that there is no God and only pure evil. This whole thesis is then wrapped up with the conversion of Thomasin, as the pious young woman then turns herself into a witch and ultimately leaves behind her faith. She has been accused of being a witch throughout and was innocent all the time, so this act is also one final expression of disobedience towards her parents and I think that rounds it up magnificently. Oh, and let's not forget about the text in the end credits that reveals that most of the depicted scenes are based on contemporary literature, actual events and that some parts of dialogue were taken directly from diaries, documents and papers from that time. That gave me the rest. All in all, this film profoundly surprised me and scared the hell out of me with its unnerving atmosphere and the merciless mind games it plays with the viewer. The ambiguity it builds up is ultimately destroyed and makes it even creepier afterwards. It is unconventional and not quite the fastest film in terms of narration, but it is intensively atmospheric, authentic and absolutely historically correct. It is an accurate portrait of a dark and moody time that knows to scare you with its source material and doesn't need to be graphic to achieve its goal. It is undeniably quiet but effective, with a magnificently supporting disturbing score and the fact that it is based on true tales and folklore makes it utterly terrifying. A special kind of horror film that I thoroughly liked. I think I am going to check out more A24 films now ...To be honest, it was very hard for me to find sleep after watching this ... especially with a dark forest nearby.",8,0,3,26 May 2020
Rosemary's Baby," The Terror of Subtlety
","'Rosemary's Baby' is a 1968 horror drama directed by Roman Polanski starring Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes. Since I was young my Dad taught me that Polanski's movies have a specific individuality to them and that he has always been way ahead of his time. I always agreed and I personally don't care about the controversies about him as a person, I've always admired him as an artist and excellent director. Besides all tragedies and scandals he never failed to make outstanding motion pictures and, as expected, this drama is no exception. First of all, this film is a text book example of a slow burner. It takes all the time it needs to build up an eclectic mystery. Unlike other horror films from this era, this one doesn't rely on jump scares and effects, in fact the main theme of the whole film is subtlety. Just as the score magnificently underlines, the horror takes place in the hidden details and, most importantly, in your own head. It obviously messes around with the viewer's own judgement and, thanks to an outstanding adapted screenplay by Polanski, manages to fool you multiple times and leads you astray in a way you can't even imagine. I sat there and couldn't decide what to believe in, as it offers clues for every possible theory. The film gets more sinister from minute to minute and this effect is also supported by the superb performance of Mia Farrow. Also mentionable is the unique camera work that splendidly captures the subliminal threat. The whole suspense builds up to the final scene where it is unleashed with an indescribably severe vehemence that hits you right in the face. The shock in Rosemary's face is the peak of it. While the shock was more or less absent throughout the course of the run time this scene brilliantly compensates for it. All in all, this film scores with the sheer brilliance of Roman Polanski's directorial style, magnificent performances and near perfect storytelling pace. It's not the average horror film and that's what makes it so legendary and that's why it will always be an iconic entry to the genre.",9,1,1,20 October 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," Powerfully enacted story that knows to grab the viewer
","'Zero Dark Thirty' is a 2012 political thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow starring Jessica Chastain and Jason Clarke. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre in 2001 are on of the most tragic events in the history of the United States of America, if not in the history of mankind in general. Whether you are American or not, this bloodcurdling day is still etched in the minds of the people. On this day only, terrorist organisation Al-Qaeda, with Osama Bin Laden leading the way, has taken the life of almost three thousand innocent Americans, and to this day, this tragedy in the beginning of the new millennium remains a day of remembrance. Shortly after these devastating happenings, every intelligence in the USA was ordered to track down and kill Bin Laden, to let him pay for what he has done. After he seemed to have vanished for multiple years, the CIA was able to eventually chase down the notorious leader of the terror network and take him out, after more than a decade-long search. This tragic story and especially how they started out with nothing are exactly what director Bigelow re-enacted with this stunning film. Beforehand, I knew that it was tough material and that it was going to be a Herculean task to depict the full vehemence of this true story, but I was sure that the director would be capable of doing it justice. Earlier this month I watched one of her earlier works, 'Point Break', and two years ago I have already seen here first collaboration with Mark Boal, 'The Hurt Locker' and that was enough for me to be persuaded that it is going to be as packing as the previously mentioned titles. Funnily enough, this film and I share a past, even though I have never seen it before. Around the time I have watched her award winning, Jeremy Renner fronted war thriller in 2018, I also had purchased this film here, but had kicked it down the road ever since. I always wanted to give it a spin in summer season, but in both 2018 and 2019, fall has come before I was able to check it out. I am not quite sure why, whether it was the long runtime or the subject matter that requires the viewer to be in a certain mood, but I never got around doing it. Only after I heard so much good things about it and it was directly recommended to me recently, I finally settled the score and gave it a watch. Oh boy, I kind of hate myself for not having watched it earlier. As I expected, Bigelow and Boal in fact made a cinematic achievement that is unlike many others. Aside from the fact that she again assembled a star-studded cast for her project, she was also able to enact the sheer intensity and complexity of the story and makes it look like the easiest task in the world. What impressed me the most to see though, that it wasn't only the glorification of probably the biggest revenge campaign in the history of the USA, but also shone a light on the shady side of this infamous operation and tackled all kinds of emotions one could feel in this context. Aside from real voice recordings, telephone calls and voice overs of news from that very day that turned out to have been used without permission, the film also depicts delicate details the US government probably didn't want to surface. As if the first minutes of black screen haven't hit me deeply enough, the sequences were detainees were tortured by CIA agents in order to receive information from them were gut-wrenching as well. I mean, who doesn't cringe at someone who is illegally waterboarded? Anyways, from there on I knew I was in for an uncompromising political thriller that doesn't mince matters in the slightest, because those two mentioned sequences were only approximately ten minutes of this two and a half hours behemoth. To be honest, my biggest fear that this film would be lengthy at times fortunately turned out to be false. Any minute less would have been insulting, as this film knows to grab its audience and not bore it out. Jessica Chastain is flat-out magnificent as the protagonist, the determined CIA operative Maya who eventually is responsible for the success of this whole operation. Her impressive performance leads the viewer through this well constructed battlefield of a plot, and with this film (that should have granted her the well-deserved Academy Award) she once again reminded me why she is one of my favourite actresses in the business (the scene she confronts Kyle Chandler's character? Boy, love her so much!). Speaking of plot, it is by far one of the most outstanding scripts I have ever seen in my entire reviewing career. It deals with an undeniably complex subject matter and still made it both, sophisticated and yet easily comprehensible. I am probably not the only one who doesn't have a notion about those kind of secret intelligence operations and researches, hence it was terrific to see that they managed to make it clear for a mainstream audience, and on top of that, extremely intriguing to follow. It is outstandingly paced and built up and calls a spade a spade. In everything it depicts, it is realistically merciless and doesn't hesitate to even tackle the hardest parts of this undoubtedly intense story. To the smallest detail, the viewer gets to witness everything, the successes, and the failure, until it peaks in the final act that is easily the most sensational sequence of the already outstandingly crafted movie. In the last roughly half and hour, Bigelow depicts the storming of Bin Laden's compound, also known as 'Operation Neptune's Spear', and enacts it so powerfully that it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The way the film captures the whole operation, it didn't feel like I was watching a work of fiction and sat in my own room, it rather felt like I was in the situation myself. Like it has been the case in this film already all the time, this was only possible thanks to three key factors: cinematography, sound, and direction. DOP Greg Freiser knows to handle the camera and enable it to capture the rawest form of vehemence that underlies every single scene. The same applies to the stunning editing and sound score that know to support this emotion as well. All of that wouldn't be as marvellous as it is without the phenomenal direction of Kathryn Bigelow who coordinates all those elements and weaves it together like it was the easiest task on earth. Oh, and the end is also worth the mention for what emotions it has caused in me. Even though I was of course aware that Bin Laden has been successfully killed in this operation, it was alleviating to see that they indeed tracked down the right man. I am not even American, but this short but significant scene made me patriotic for a country I don't have the slightest connection with. As if that satisfaction wasn't already enough, we also get another scene that wraps up the role of our beloved protagonist Maya. After identifying the body as her main target, she is flown out back to the states, as she then has no task anymore. That was indeed a heart-breaking sequence, as she breaks out in tears, for she has spent most of her life on this one man and hence feels like she has no purpose anymore. I don't know if that was really important to the plot, but it unexpectedly touched me. All in all, this outstanding political thriller combines everything it needs to do this real story justice and treat it with respect. It doesn't omit a detail and narrates this story in a powerful manner and is also near perfect in terms of cinematic qualities. Lead by a brilliant Chastain, the star-studded cast knows to make the merciless story come to life in all its facets and still extremely enjoyable, nevertheless. It is complex, complicated, and yet, easy to follow, and most importantly, magnificently build up, well-paced and using its indeed long runtime superbly. All this is the work of outstanding director Kathryn Bigelow who seems to be the Hollywood counterpart of King Midas, as everything she touches turns to gold. An outstanding film, a phenomenal political thriller, and a title that everyone should have seen at least once, as it is film making par excellence. I am literally in awe for this cinematic achievement and wish I had seen it earlier. Don't make the same mistake I did and go watch it now if you haven't already. Simply Marvellous cinema.",9,0,0,28 June 2020
Joker," Social commentary smiling in your face
","'Joker' is a 2019 drama directed by Todd Phillips starring Joaquin Phoenix and Robert DeNiro. When it was announced that the director of the 'Hangover' trilogy would do a standalone movie for Batman's arch nemesis, many people expected it to be a total disaster, but when the first pictures were released around a year ago my doubts made way for extreme curiosity. Even more, when the first trailer arrived. After this I declared it a potential masterpiece. In those few minutes of footage it gave me goosebumps, mostly because it reminded me of 'Taxi Driver' and even 'Requiem For A Dream'. As a die hard Heath Ledger fan, I was genuinely interested to see how Phoenix would portray the clown prince of Gotham. Now I finally got the chance to experience it - and it was worth the wait. From start to finish the film throws the audience into the depressing alleys of Gotham city and conveys the sad and oppressive atmosphere nonstop. As I expected, Joaquin Phoenix once again shows that he's one of the most versatile actors of his generation and delivers a powerhouse performance that still impresses me hours after the credits rolled. He gave his portrayal something no one has done before, he made him human and inhuman at the same time, an anti-hero the audience hates to identify with. The way he laughs, how he moves and dances and even his outer appearance gave this version something unique and outstanding. He treated Ledgers legacy well, least to say. It's reported that people walked out of the screening stating that it's to violent, but I think the people just felt uncomfortable, because they felt ashamed that what they saw is exactly how our modern society works. That's one of the most important aspects of the whole film: The social criticism hits you right in the face and makes you reconsider your own values and social behaviour. Of course it had gritty violence as well, but the way it was selectively used made it so unsettling. The plot is rich in detail and an absolutely well paced decline of the sanity of a social outcast. It even features instances of an unreliable narrator that fits perfectly with the overall storytelling. Several scenes gave me goosebumps and the feeling that they someday will be as iconic as the best 'Taxi Driver' moments and I genuinely loved it. The final act was even the best of the whole film, it's dark and packing and I liked how it occasionally connected the independent story to the comic book source as well.
All in all, this film is a modern masterpiece that leaves you speechless multiple times and despite it's comic book origin manages to be something original. It is an outstanding character study about a social outcast that hits us at the correct spots: The way we treat people with mental illness and people that we consider as worthless. That's what this movie shows us, if we want it or not. That's what makes it so incredibly magnificent. It will haunt you, but justified. If Joaquin Phoenix won't get the Oscar as the best actor, many people will riot on the streets like Joker's henchmen. That's for sure.",10,0,1,14 October 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," Absolutely outstanding masterpiece!
","'To Kill A Mockingbird' is a 1962 drama directed by Robert Mulligan starring Gregory Peck and Mary Badham. Back when I was in my school years, we got around reading most of the literary classics in English class. I personally had the chance to read 'Death of a Salesman' or 'Brave New World', but never actually had the chance to read some other of the most famous works that eventually were adapted to the big screen. Next to 'A Streetcar Named Desire' the controversial 1961 Harper Lee novel of the same name this movie's based on always had my immense curiosity. It's one of those novels you hear of from countless sources and due to the fact that I really don't have time anymore to voluntarily read books (uni life doesn't allow me!), I decided to skip that and watch it right away. What am I to say? This film's again shown me how much I love my passion. First of all, this film managed to fail my personal expectations and excel them with something even greater instead. I sorta needed to get used to the fact that it's told through the perspective of a young girl and that most of the story focuses on the children. What I expected to be just a two hour depiction of a twisted criminal case turns out to be exactly this, but interwoven into a beautiful coming of age story. The whole film is a single profound metaphor about justice and injustice that lives from all the small details attached to it. It focuses on the unrighteousness and the presence of racism and prejudices. It's told through the eyes of a child that had to deal with it in her juvenile and somewhat naÃ¯ve stage of life and I think that's one of the best aspects of the narration. Cause children are the purest human beings on earth, you know? It empathically examines the severe danger of ignorance, intolerance and indifference on a level that can be comprehended by everyone. It's a magnificently written story and wonderfully constructed situation that teaches even the ones who thought they'd know it all. It raises both ethically and morally important questions that define and at the same time heavily criticise our society. What is it that makes us so intolerant? Why do we think we stand above other humans? Why do we hate what we fear and why don't we just step over our own opinion? Why is there still so much injustice in this world? The film asks the viewer and mercilessly points out each and every aspect that make anyone who watches it feel uncomfortable, because as shockingly as it sounds, it appeals to both the past and even our modern times and nobody can deny that it's still one of the most grave problems of our society. Lead by an outstanding performance of Peck as charismatic lawyer Atticus Finch, the rest of the cast, especially the child actors, perform on a coequal level and definitely use the full potential of this masterful story. The end of the court scene absolutely enraged me, because this iniquitousness contradicted all of my sense of reason and was simply outrageous to me and I think that's when I knew Harper Lee did her best work. She never intended to reach something else. What has been scandalous then is still relevant now, because this sort of mindset still exists in some people's heads. The final conclusion is also the conclusion of the excellent mockingbird metaphor that teaches us to not fear what we personally don't know and that we shouldn't be killing something that's obviously innocent, only because we are to much filled up with hateful prejudices that doesn't match reality. At the same time though, it subliminally criticises that people always act in their own beliefs of law eventually. That's the quintessence of the story. In the end, I felt so many emotions that I couldn't even completly describe it with words. All in all, this novel adaptation is a perfect example for a magnificent enactment of a literary classic. It's absolutely touching and shocking, mostly thanks to the outstanding achievement in acting and writing. It's compelling storytelling at it's finest and a thought provoking masterpiece that is still relevant today and that everyone should have watched at least once in life. Absolutely brilliant!",10,0,1,18 February 2020
Army of Darkness," Sir Ash, Lord of the medieval madness
","'Army Of Darkness' is a 1993 horror comedy directed by Sam Raimi starring Bruce Campbell and Embeth Davidtz. The final chapter of Raimi's 'Evil Dead' trilogy is the most overexcited of them all. While the shift from splatter horror to horror comedy sounds weird, but is still imaginable, the idea that the third outing is a medieval fantasy comedy is absolutely overwhelming. Centered around our chainsaw and shotgun wielding anti-hero, Ash Williams, the whole plot takes place in 1300 A.D. - and as messed up as it sounds - it's absolute fun from start to finish. The premise might sound tremendously ludicrous, but the execution managed to be ludicrous in a good way . It has a cheap but adorable charme to it. Mostly thanks to the crafty dialogue and absurd humour of the Raimi brothers the odd atmosphere comes to life. Next to exaggerated slapstick stunts (that pay an homage to the Stooges!) and hilarious, but well crafted visual effects, it even offers a decent story with extreme absurdity and ridiculous comedy gold. Let's not forget to mention the score, especially the theme of the army itself. Some scenes are too ridiculous even for my taste, but it's the style of the film that fills me with vast infantile joy. The final battle, with all its pompousness and impressive stop-motion effects, feels weirdly epic in its own unique way. It appeals to the inner child in all of us and it doesn't want to achieve anything more. All in all, this film is a treat for hardcore fans of the predecessors. It's stylish, weird and absurd from start to finish and if you can embrace the medieval madness you'll enjoy it as I did it. It's not everybody's darling, but a groovy end of an iconic horror franchise.",8,2,3,4 November 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," 'Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.'
","'The Shawshank Redemption' is a 1994 drama directed by Frank Derabont starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in the leading roles. Movies based on the novels and stories of mastermind Stephen King enjoyed massive popularity for now almost half a century, some as critically acclaimed masterpieces ('The Shining', 'The Green Mile') and some as mediocre but cult classic flicks ('Pet Semetary', 'Christine'). Although they never fail to entertain it's not always easy to predict where an adaptation ranges. In this case though, it's obvious.  I mean, could 2.2 Million other cinephiles be totally wrong? I guess not. This film definitely deserves the first spot. As a bookwork who loves the original short story it's satisfying to see how well adapted it is and how true it is to its source material. It had slightly different changes, but they were all for the better. I know, in the novella Red is a red-headed Irish man, but who would dislike a story narrated by Morgan Freeman? Additionally, he and Robbins performed outstandingly and acted together so well. This film is a melancholic and simultaneously hopeful journey of a falsely convicted banker and depicts how he manages to fulfill his dream of freedom. It's wonderfully filmed by the legendary and somewhat underappreciated cinematographer Roger Deakins and he really knows how to capture the devastation and the depressing tone of the story. Each and every brilliantly written character was spectacularly portrayed by their respective actor. Unlike other prison break movies this film addresses the dramatic and philosophical aspect of a lifetime sentence: What distinguishes an inmate from a human being? Of course most people commited a crime, but is it really necessary to take them in for a whole life? This film sensitively tries to answer these questions and shows us that although everything they have done, the inmates are still human beings. It's social criticism at it's finest, extremely emotionally shown through the story of Brooks. The ones who served their whole life in prison never get the chance to rehabilitate and reintegrate into society. It's simply devastating to see at times, sometimes the brutality shows itself by violence and sometimes by unexplainable human behaviour. Despite all those prominent aspects this film also depicts the hopes and dreams of a man and inspiringly tells us that it's never to late to dream and that we as humans should never give up. All in all, this cinematic masterpiece lives up to its reputation and gives us an unforgettable experience that gives you goosebumps by its packing narrative and outstanding performances. This one of the best dramas ever made and will always be a milestone achievement in the history of cinema. Brilliant!",10,0,0,24 September 2019
Halloween," Terror in the daytime
","'Halloween' is a 1978 horror film directed by John Carpenter starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence. No Halloween time goes by without having watched this absolute masterpiece. With each rewatch, I increasingly like it more and more, because I can spot so much brilliance from time to time. First of all, it's a perfectly structured and paced horror thriller that gives me chills due to so many different aspects. There's probably no soundtrack more iconic and fitting than those simple keyboard notes. In a Hitchcock manner, it carries the tension throughout the whole run time. Additionally, Carpenter created something never seen before: While there are also a lot of scence taking place in the dark, many shocking scenes take place at daytime, thus destroying the stereotype that it's only frightening as soon as the sun set. Michael Meyers, as iconic as the horror movie genre itself, terrorises the audience at daytime. That's what makes it so uniquely uncomfortable. He's also one of the greatest characters ever written for a motion picture. He's unpredictable and evil, with no obvious motifs and rules he follows, neither human nor monster, just pure evil. Furthermore, the scenery and the setting are tremendously atmospheric and as soon as the sun goes down the most terrifying part of the film begins. With clever camera work the intense writing style of Carpenter and Hill comes to life, especially the haunting nature of the boogeyman. Lead by scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis, the cast consists of both extremely talented young actors and legends. The story might not be extremely gory, as the brutality lies in the paranoid atmosphere. The ending is without a doubt one of the most realistic staging of the sub-genre, as the character decisions might be imprudent but still justified. It's not like someone is tripping over literally nothing. All in all, this horror classic is the benchmark for any horror film in general and will always hold the place of the best slasher in history. Often copied, but never reached, it lives from its special kind of terrorising atmosphere, it's talented cast and the music score itself. With this motion picture, John Carpenter made himself immortal and justified the title of being the master of horror.",10,0,0,2 November 2019
The Greatest Showman," The greatest songs ... In a too rushed story
","'The Greatest Showman' is a 2017 musical drama directed by Michael Gracey starring Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams. I happened to have another movie date and I again let the lady choose what to watch and she brought one of the few films she owns herself. So we gave this musical flick a watch together. It was actually one of those films I was stoked to check out as I heard many positive thing about it, but was also hesitant to give it a spin as some even labelled it as a disaster. In my opinion, it's both in some way. One of the most confusing aspects is the absolutely fast pace that really could have been way more slowly. I mean, the relationship between Barnum and his wife is rushed in the blink of an eye, literally during one song and didn't even stop once to allow the characters to create some sort of chemistry. It's one of the problems I expected when I noticed the runtime of only 109 minutes and it really shows how a duration of more than two hours would have been more of an advantage. Also, the specific character development of Jackman's Barnum is well played, but criminally terrible in terms of character traits. He went from a dreamer with a vision and the will to prove the world that talent doesn't come from how much money you have to an arrogant snob who only defines his personality with how wealthy he is and only cares about the opinion of the aristocratic people within a few minutes. Even when he turns it around again in the end, it's a shame to see it develop like this. Hence, the focus doesn't really lie on him and for a protagonists I expected to be the appealing figure this was more than a simple let down. Furthermore, the film's obvious core message is that human beings can achieve anything if they wanted to and that everyone is perfect just the way they are. It's about individualism, hopes and dreams and a call for outcasts and loners to be themselves. It's clear, isn't it? Then why does the protagonist betray those values and why does it spend so much time to (I hope!) unwillingly ridicule and laugh at the outcast characters. Of course, it's done to make them more sympathic and inspire them to sing a wonderful song about it (plot convenience, I assume), but the amount of time it spends to laugh about them prevails and I think it's pretty sad that it contradicts it's try of an uplifting philosophy. It made me feel uncomfortable at times and originally intended the total opposite. Aside from this though, it also has something great to offer as well. For instance, the modern camera work enables the viewer to not just experience the tension, but to even feel it as if the circus was in the living room. The dance choreography goes hand it hand with the singing decently and creates some moments of extreme pleasure. It's full of satisfying colours and numbers and contains only outstanding songs. From 'A Million Dreams' to 'This Is Me' they are all beautifully arranged and stuck in my head for a very long time. Next to this, it's notable that all the actors and actresses proved some impressive singing talent that made it even more enjoyable to me as a musician. All in all, it's beauty in a mess and even though the characters are mostly too shallow it has something charming to it. Beneath the horribly executed and double sided moral it follows it's a decent fun nevertheless. It really makes 'style over substance' work by covering it's flaws with pompousness and frantic camera angles and even though it might not go down in history as an ingenious piece of film, it surely will for its memorable songs and musicality. Despite it's execution, it's somehow still inspiring and a fun watch for in between.",7,0,0,9 March 2020
Casino Royale," Grabs you by ... you know
","'Casino Royale' is a 2006 action thriller directed by Martin Campbell starring Daniel Craig and Eva Green. It's less than a month till the final installment of The Craig Bond saga hits the cinemas and after watching that trailer and listening to that dope new song by Billie Eilish, I decided to finally give the predecessors a watch. Admittedly, I've never seen any of the Ian Fleming adaptation films, neither the classics nor the modern adaptations, it just never appealed to me so much, but then my brother encouraged me to give them a spin and review them just in time before the conclusion arrives. And boy, this one packs a punch. Within the first minutes the film began to elaborate an excellently well balanced pace that couldn't have been done better. In the first act it's action packed and the chase sequences are so well choreographed that the daredevilry simply amazed me. The thing, it's not the only greatness the film has to offer, because in the second half it shows it's also a masterful thriller in it's core. The titular casino scene is filmed with such a tension that it literally gave me sweaty hands an basically had me on the edge of my seat countless times. And it was just a game of poker, in general! I didn't expect it to be this well written, that's why I was tremendously impressed. Next to this, it's filmed in such an ingenious way and the camera work is superb and at times I even forgot that it's a fourteen years old flick already - it just looks timelessly great even compared to modern action features. Aside from this, the cast is playing convincingly in here. Although I don't have any way of comparison, I think that Daniel Craig did a decent job and is as cool as an ice cube in a Vodka martini (is it served like this? Nevermind, you know what I mean!) and also Eva Green as the femme fatale is simply gorgeous and Mads Mikkelsen as the villain is brilliant as always. They all make their respective characters come to life and so interesting and I cared for all of them throughout. Although the film almost hits the two and a half hour mark in terms of run time, I haven't felt bored once. The atmosphere is always excellently built up and even the dialogue was so brilliantly constructed. For example this one scene in the train. I literally sat there and told my brother that that's one of the best dialogues I've seen recently. So much wit, so much sass and so much tension. What makes this intriguing story even better are the countless twists that caught me off guard all the time. Just when I thought the problem was solved it was like 'No - takes this!' and I was shocked at times, in a positive way. It's a nail biting tension throughout the entire run time that followed me until the end. I think the peak of this feeling was the torture scene that - without sounding to vulgar - grabbed me by the balls. I felt every single emotion and every second of pain in this twisted flick. All in all, the first Craig Bond delivered surprisingly great entertainment and manages almost perfectly to balance the film between high pulse action sequences and high pulse thriller scenes and additionally looks so great as well. It's cool and stylish throughout and a magnificent kickoff to this project. It will be pretty hard to excel this outstanding piece of espionage thriller, but I'm still stoked!",9,1,3,3 March 2020
The Deer Hunter," How war destroys the lives of innocent people...
","'The Deer Hunter' is a 1978 war drama directed by Michael Cimino starring Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken. Films centred around the brutality and meaninglessness of war have always played a major role in modern cinema and never failed to remind the audience of said aspects. Each and every war in the history of mankind was at least depicted once and, in the most cases, in a super realistic manner. From classic World War II drama 'Saving Private Ryan' to recently released World War I feature '1917' every single battle is at least represented once. The Vietnam war makes no exception in this concept. But before there was Francis Ford Coppola's epos, there was 'The Deer Hunter'. If my researches are correct it's one of the first, if not literally the first film to depict this horrifying time in history that seems to still pose as a trauma in the hearts of countless Americans. And yet, it's not a genre typical movie at all, because the conflict itself is a means to the end. Basically, it's a character study centered around the soldiers in the first place. This three hour long cinematic colossus is principally divided into three stages: Before, during and after the protagonists have been to hell. While it could be seen as a narrative flaw that the scenes are generally stretched and simply too long in the first place, I think that's one of the films extraordinary strengths. In the first act, it intentionally takes much time to build up the character constellation and gives us the chance to intensively get to know them. Before they went to war, they're only a group of best friends from a Pennsylvanian industrial small town enjoying life to the fullest, fooling around, drinking beer and go hunting and celebrating their best friend's wedding as the climax. It's supposed to portray the simplicity and carelessness of life - without any worries and problems. The first hour of runtime literally shows how they do said things. It might be a decision other viewers might dislike, but I personally love this almost tragically slow pace. It had an effect on me, because in this one specific scene where on of the friends quietly plays the piano and the others become silent is just breathtaking, because they all become aware of what will happen next. Supported by the rough editing style, the film then all suddenly switches to Vietnam at a moment's notice. Without any preparation or unnecessary stretching. That's the metaphorical brutality I was talking about. In the second act, the brutality shows itself through blood, gore and nasty violence, what it has literally always been, reaching the top in the first Russian roulette scene. High tension and brilliant acting at it's finest, gut-wrentching and shocking in both effects and narration. Surprisingly, of it's whole duration the film spends the shortest amount of time on the battlefield, as it then focuses on the three individual cases of the now separated friends: DeNiro's Michael comes home to find himself in a place that doesn't feel like home anymore and seems to no longer enjoy the things that used to make him happy, Savage's Steven is crippled and physically suffers from the effects of combat and Walker's Nick is AWOL and sick of the pointlessness of fighting. It mercilessly continues to show how a meaningless war destroys the easy lives and friendship of simple men and disrupts them irreversibly. Astonishing character development included. It's ingeniously underlined by two prominent metaphors. The first being the Russian roulette that occurs in the context of enforcement, entertainment and free choice and is supposed to show that anyone can die in a war that was motivated by many different aspects and may cost the life of anyone, out of nowhere and randomly. The second metaphor is the meaning of the titular deer hunting, as it's supposed to boldly show how senseless killing of any living creature is. All in all, this touching character study relentlessly depicts how a meaningless war impacts the lives of innocent and happy young humans permanently. It's absolutely brutal on many levels, from visuals to emotional depth and once again shows through unusual, yet excellent writing and acting performances of its leads that nobody ever wins at war. An important entry to the genre and magnificent example that a three hour behemoth can feel like a ninety minutes feature without any problems. That's cinema at it's finest.",9,1,1,16 February 2020
The Sixth Sense," Shyamalan's touching masterpiece
","'The Sixth Sense' is a 1999 mystery horror drama directed by M. Night Shyamalan starring Bruce Willis and Hayley Joel Osment. In the wake of having watched 'The Others' yesterday, I thought I'd stay in the genre and rewatch another chilling classic I consider as an example of excellent writing. Whilst I already knew about the shocking plot twist in the end upon the first time watch (thanks a lot, Doctor Cox!), I was curious about how detailedly MNS constructed his twist in terms of continuity. And man, this film is a sheer balancing act of narration as it's constantly on the brink of giving away its true nature. This is without a doubt the best movie by Shyamalan and he shows his brilliance in everything he handles. He knows to capture the quintessential melancholic nature of his magnificently perceived and superbly enacted feature oh too well. The story he has constructed with this is definitely the best one in his whole filmography. Not only does he wrap up his film properly without letting it become a mess (thank God!), before it gets there it delivers an ingenious range of genres and combines them into something unique. In the beginning, he establishes extremely well elaborated characters the audience sympathize with immediately and puts them into ... a family drama? Absolutely! It's nothing else in the first place. Dr. Crowe deals with marital difficulties all the while trying to follow his job as a child psychologist who wants to help a heavily mentally troubled boy with his problems. Doesn't really sound like a horror film, doesn't it? The best about this plot is how it only slowly introduces the horror into this already convincing drama. Before you actually have the time to realize it, it pulled off a clean genre shift in front of your eyes. I think the shift is done right after Cole speaks his famous 'I see dead people' quote, as it then continues to narrate the story from his exact point of view. Then you're going to understand the director's true intentions. It's only creepy to a certain degree and solely mildly scary to let you experience Cole's perspective and how he gradually begins to accept his significant role. Speaking of which, the film lives from its child actor performance and gives him most of the responsibility to make this film a hit. Willis might have shown his most versatile performance and Collette is without a doubt gorgeous as always, but no one shines as bright as Hayley Joel Osment. He steals the show from everyone and is the main reason the film developed such a scary atmosphere. The way he hesitantly begins to face his fears is not only impressive, I also thought of it as metaphor. In a supernatural manner it stands for the stages of dealing with mental illness, especially anxiety states and shows how he step by step begins to cope with his disorder. In the end, he didn't only developed perfectly, the audience has also learned something from him and that's unexpectedly great. Oh, before I forget, let's not forget about the phenomenal plot twist in the end. It's such a powerful scene of letting go that didn't really make me cry, but hit me right in the emotionality. The film doesn't really make me feel depressed, it more a positive kind of sadness and melancholy that works its way through the story. Cole went from helpless to helper and taught everyone in this film something about themselves. What else am I supposed to feel? It's heartbreakingly heartwarming, least to say. All in all, this flick is a mystery drama par excellence that sensitively guides the viewer through a well done mix of mystery drama and horror and poses as a parable for facing one's fears, dealing with mental illness and even tackles loss and grief. It's near perfection and MNS's best. Oh, before I forget: Another thing I also wanted to point out is how Cole is designed. Not only do I think that he has some sort of The Shining, to me it also feels like an Shyamalanian origin story of a hero that could easily play in the same universe as the Glass trilogy. I mean, it's not impossible and it took sixteen years for 'Unbreakable' to get a sequel. I mean, why not?",9,0,0,10 April 2020
The Great Escape," Charismatic cast in a stylish and elegant story
","'The Great Escape' is a 1963 war adventure drama directed by John Sturges starring Steve McQueen and James Garner. Just like I am a sucker for space dramas and westerns, there is also another subgenre I like to visit from time to time: prison break movies. Even though I haven't seen the TV show of the exact same name, I still can claim that I have seen enough to consider myself a fan of the genre. From Stallone's pseudo intelligent fun flick 'Escape Plan' to Eastwood's all time classic 'Escape From Alcatraz' I have seen most of them, but only after getting deeper into the 1960s and making enquiries about a cinematic era that now belongs to one of my favourites, I stumbled over this essential entry as well. Since Frank Bullitt himself stars in the leading role, I could not wait to check it out, but since the film amounts to almost three hours of runtime, I haven't had the time to give it watch earlier. Now that the pandemic still incapacitates any form of social life, and I am stuck at home I thought it was finally time to get down to it and see McQueen and his fellows trying to escape. It was probably the best idea I have had in the past few weeks, because even with this epic duration I wasn't bored once while watching it. Also, you know you are watching an iconic film when you recognize the main theme even if you haven't seen the film ever before, but several homages and parodies. It immediately got me in the mood for what was about to come and what came then was simply splendid. Director Sturges managed to assemble one of the most charismatic and at the same time talented casts I have ever seen in a film. Aside from McQueen you got James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasence and even a surprisingly convincing Charles Bronson. Those are only the biggest names and it doesn't change the fact that every single actor, from leading role to small supporting role was absolutely charismatic and authentic in their own unique way. Since the film is based on spectacular true events that took place in a detention camp somewhere in Germany and the fact that I am German myself, I was simply impressed by the extreme authenticity this film offered. Not only was the setting atmospheric and true to the story (it was actually shot on location in southern Germany), it was such a delight to see that they casted actual compatriots in the respective roles. What many from outside of my country probably aren't able to evaluate is how brilliant the pronunciation of every single actor was. Of course, it was easy for the German native speakers to deal with their mother tongue, but it was impressive how all the anglophone actors proved their certain skill. For example, I never thought I would see how a young John Hammond diverts suspicion from himself by fluently phrasing that he is not an Englishman ('Ich bin kein Engländer!'). The other way round, it was not less impressive how the Germans proved their skills in the English language and the fact that they all of course had a distinctive accent made it even more suave. No, this film doesn't lack credibility in the slightest and it is only one small aspect of the greatness that unfolds in the following hours. Aside from this, it was extremely fascinating to see how the film establishes its characters. Even though I was mildly confused by the fact that McQueen's Hilts is in the cooler most of the time and plays only a small but significant role (hence the nickname 'The Cooler King', I guess), I think it was quite an achievement how this film handled so many different characters and made me sympathize with every single one of them nevertheless. Every one of them got his bit of spotlight in the process and I loved to see them planning their next big escape. To the last man, every single one had an individual personality and played an important role in this ultimate master plan. Let's put it this way, they all lived up to their nicknames. What did the Luftwaffe expect from putting the best and most infamous jailbreakers together in one prison? Appropriate behaviour? Hardly likely. Of course, they do what they do best and begin planning already on the day they arrive. Considering how they elaborate a strategy you can see that they don't do it for the first time. The most outstanding aspect about the whole plan though is how highly sophisticated it is. From start to finish its elaborated and calculates any form of hazard and advantage. It is this extreme dedication, this extraordinarily high love for detail in both the plan and the screenplay that depicts it that make this film so incredibly entertaining. It is remarkably well paced and allows the viewer to dig into the story and the characters without letting it become too boring. Furthermore, it fortunately features enough hazards and dangers that threaten the execution of the plan so that it never loses its tension and doesn't proceed too easily. While it spends the first two hours on depicting the elaboration and execution of the plan, the last third shows how the lucky few escapees try to deal with the last steps of their flight, outside of prison walls and barbed wire. Believe it or not, in this final act the individual fates differ extremely from case to case and with the Gestapo and SS on their heels it even creates some extremely intense scenarios full of suspense. The work of several weeks might be shattered in the matter of seconds and the characters do their absolute best to not get caught and the enemy is so close to busting them several times. The scenarios cannot be any more differently packing. For instance, while the situation of Bartlett and Mac is more of a stealth mission, Hilts literally goes full throttle and involuntarily embarks on a reckless motorcycle pursuit over green meadows (and border fences). Thus, the film offers an extreme range of emotional scenes in the end, going from suspenseful and quiet sequences to action packed and loud scenes over the whole course. On top of that, it also includes some instances of subtle humour and even a few seriously sad moments in the end. Is this film perfect then? Close to, but if there is one thing, I am not hundred percent satisfied with, it has got to be the general handling of the prisoners by the German soldiers. The leadership lacked this specific authority and brutality and the lightness it shows was a little weird to see. I mean, you have dozens of the most infamous breakaways cooped up in one camp and their leader officially stated that his men are trying to escape on every cost. Considering this, the security precautions were ridiculously low and the routine inspections fairly rare. Just like they wanted them to try to escape in some way. Well, but that's only criticism at the highest stage, as it still worked out that way and didn't disturb the narration in any way. All in all, this film is an authentic and atmospheric entry to the genre and knows to entertain in many ways, thanks to one of the most charismatic and talented casts, an ingeniously written screenplay and plot and a moody cinematography and an iconic score and main theme. It delivers a historically accurate and massive fun for fans of the genre and offers a lot of brilliant ideas to keep your attention during its fairly extreme run time. I personally haven't felt bored once and it flied by without letting it become any less entertaining. It is grippingly narrated, stylish and elegant and probably the ultimate prison break movie if not the greatest escape film of all time. Splendid!",9,1,1,3 May 2020
Pineapple Express," (Shoot'em) Up in smoke!
","'Pineapple Express' is a 2008 action comedy directed by David Gordon Green starring Seth Rogen and James Franco. The moment I read the names Apatow, Rogen and Goldberg in the opening credits I knew that the upcoming flick is gonna be pure comedy gold. It's always remarkable to see how Seth Rogen manages to play himself in every film he appears in. He always plays the sympathic and clumsy stoner, but it's not even a bad thing. It will probably never happen that he wins an Oscar, but it always fills me with joy to watch his on screen shenanigans. In this film it's not different. In the beginning, it was somewhat boring because it seemed like the rest of the film is gonna be only about the philosophy of super stoners, but as the first shot was fired I knew I was in for an amusing genre mix. As usual, the chemistry between Rogen and Franco (obviously) made the characters extremely sympathic. The plot itself offers some surprising twists and well written action scenes, decorated with unexpected brutal effects and extraordinary twists. I mean, how is it possible that two potheads that smoke one joint per scene end up in a war between American and Chinese drug mafia? At times it's just ridiculous nonsense, at times it's extremely sophisticated comedy. Of course it's strange to see the two lead actors carrying guns and Gary Cole as merciless mobster, but in this case it works out, because the film doesn't take itself too seriously and knows what it actually is. Also the appearances of other members of the Apatow bunch make it a lot more funnier. In conclusion, this stoner feature delivers decent fun with a weird combination of action and comedy, a usual great cast and hilarious writing that doesn't go into a infantile direction. Behind all the (gun-)smoke there's heart and that's all it needs. Entertaining and surprisingly good comedy.",8,0,0,19 October 2019
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Bloody kisses and fancy hair
","'Interview with the Vampire' is a 1994 horror drama directed by Neil Jordan starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. I've always been fascinated by the myth of vampires, undead and soulless wanderers of the night and and all the small details that belonged to the lore. For now 122 years, mostly influenced by Bram Stoker's infamous novel 'Dracula', the stories have been retold and adapted ever since. I've almost watched every film that's related to this legend. So it was about time I got to watch this classic as well. First of all it's strange to see such a top-class cast playing in this film. Next to the leading gentlemen we have Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater and a young Kirsten Dunst. Especially the last one gave an excellent performance and managed to stay on an equal level with the others throughout the whole run time. It's just wonderful how said actors harmonise on screen and no one ever steals anyone's show. They all undeniably share a genuine chemistry. Nevertheless, the screenplay shows both, brilliance and slight flaws. The dialogue and how it's written is sheer impressive, just the way it's worded, but the plot also fails to fully give the viewer the chance to sink their teeth into the characters (pun intended). At times they're too distanced and I never managed to reach the level of sympathy for them I hoped to reach. It's not like I didn't care for them, but also the slow storytelling provided that the film suffered from its length at times. A shorter run time would have done better. It may not sound like it, but that's not actually a big deal, there are countless aspects that make this film great. The way this whole production is filmed is just eerie and the cinematography creates a saddening atmosphere. It's a melancholic tale, philosophical and poetic, about life and death, loneliness and love, morals and values. Mostly the character Louis caught my curiosity. He has a lot in common with BTVS' Angel and you know I like that a lot, although it sometimes appears that the film wants to show off how handsome Brad Pitt is with his fancy hair. But he's not the only charming aspect of it: The sets and sceneries are impressively authentic and the costumes are extremely noble and well crafted. Furthermore, the effects and makeup are surprisingly brutal in the first case and seductively modest in the latter case.
Also the ambiguity of the whole vampire theme is clearly noticeable, it has a lot of erotic undertones and sexual innuendos. All in all, this stylish and handsome drama knows how to impress with looks and overshadow its flaws. It's enough to make it an enjoyable entry to the sub-genre, it has the phenomenal cast and exceptional design. It's good, but could have been a true masterpiece instead.",8,0,0,26 November 2019
The Cabin in the Woods," The Evil Truman Show
","'The Cabin In The Woods' is a 2011 horror film directed by Drew Goddard starring Kristen Connolly and Chris Hemsworth. As some of you may know, my favourite TV show of all time still is 'Buffy - The Vampire Slayer' and even though I've seen other brilliant shows since then, this one will forever remain in my heart. What makes it so extraordinarily great was the characters, the wit in the writing and the moderately scary atmosphere. Since this flick here was directed by one of the writers of the show and produced by Joss Whedon himself, I expected something similar in this case to happen. Basically, it wasn't far away from being a twisted episode of Buffy, but not one of the greatest ones either. The general idea behind this horror flick is the question 'What if we combine The Evil Dead and Truman Show?' - and those influences are highly palpable. I can't really tell if this film pays homage to them or simply rips them off. It would fit the overall sarcastic writing style or Whedon and company, but it's not unambiguously noticeable. Are the stereotypical characters deliberate? Are the horror film clichés deliberate? Or haven't they had enough ideas to avoid those aspects? I can't tell, fact is that they are prominent in the story. Probably the best aspect of it was the idea to have the horror happen as part of a reality TV show. The criticism of human behaviour and how people profit from the suffering of others made me wann throw up several time, but not because I felt nauseous, just because it made me absolutely sick. The beginning built up an interesting premise and promised some creepy stuff to happen, but in the course of the second act there was nothing quite innovative. From all the threats they could have unleashed on the campers, from all the horror it could have created, they decided to use 'just zombies' instead and it was kinda overused after the first kill. That's another problem of this film. The characters you couldn't care less about (and who miraculously heal from fatal wound within seconds) are killed too fast and it almost feels like Goddard wanted to rush the second act as fast as he could so we can all experience his conclusion to the story. The final act was indeed a gore fest with some brutal effects, but again, the creatures are not in focus. It's only a glimpse of horror we could have got and, to be honest, it wasn't even scary at all. Not even once. No jump scare or a feeling of threat. It feels more like a mockery that couldn't decide whether it should be a mockery or a serious horror film. In any way, I didn't buy any of the aspired directions for one hundred percent. Despite some cameos of Buffyverse actors and a surprise appearance of Segourney Weaver, the film didn't offer any surprises in the end. The final conclusion was a lazy idea and felt like a 'we-have-to-end-the-movie-here' type of decision that didn't do the rest of the film's nature justice. At least the Whedonesque wit and humour could be found in the dialogue and story. All in all, this horror flick (I guess) is a decent fun with an interesting premise, but couldn't distance itself from its obvious influences. Aside from tonal disturbances and a rushed story it still managed to entertain, even though it left out the frightening part. Nothing all to bad, but not as brilliant as it could have been. Yet, not disappointed.",6,0,3,23 February 2020
Spectre," Bond is back doing what he does best ... Winning effortlessly
","'Spectre' is a 2015 action thriller directed by Sam Mendes starring Daniel Craig and Christoph Waltz. With this Sunday, the Road To Bond 25 has concluded for now and the latest installment has offered a lot of positive, as well as some negative aspects in an overall promising story. I personally consider the third movie to be best of the new saga, so I knew that it would be hard for the next sequel to become an equally entertaining thriller. While it's not exactly as messy as 'QOS', it's not as brilliant as 'Skyfall' either, but I expected nothing else, so I still could have some pleasure with it. First of all, it's a pity to see that the writers took back a lot of Bond's personal character development and healed him from a lot of the pain he's been through before in the process. He's again cool as always. But only cool as always. Where's the emotionality? Where's the vulnerability? It appears that he can take everything again without any great effort. It's quite sad to me that he's again given some sort of immortality. Aside from this, the film delivered some decent entertainment. Speaking of the story, the film managed to elaborate a well made continuation of 'Skyfall'. A secret mission that M has literally given to James from the grave? That's a nice link to the past, to be honest. It allows our favourite daredevil to perform some impressive stunts and disappoint the orders of his current employer. So, he's basically back at doing at what he does best. With a runtime of again two and a half hours, the film has still a lot to offer, even when it takes some time to get to to the best scenes. While following the legacy of his deceased former ally, Bond is once again tangled up in heart racing stunts and hard fights, the helicopter scene in the beginning being the most breathtaking of all of them. I also gotta give David Bautista some credit here, as he really brings the action into every scene with his simple presecne. The fight choreography on the train? Absolutely brutal and well made. What bothers me the most about this film though, is the general premise of it. Even if it more and more digs in the past of its protagonist and unravels secret after secret, it still kind of stays too much on the surface the most time and, most importantly, doesn't really create a threat that Bond has to eliminate. Before, the life of M and the lives of countless undercover agents were on the line. In here, the most work is done by his co-workers who manage to stop the MI6 to be merged with all other secret intelligence agencies. To be honest, he only finds out about the connection by coincidence. I was sure from the beginning that he'd succeed. Even if that's still tolerable and didn't keep me from having decent fun, it's still was a thorn in my side. Also notable is how Lea Seydoux is playing a femme fatale that is actually on a par with 007. Next to this, my feelings about the main villain were absolutely divided. On the one hand, Christoph Waltz played his role wonderfully with such a subtle danger he exudes and definitely made the fan boy in me scream out in excitement as he revealed himself as legendary Bond foe Ernst Blofeld, but on the other hand it bothers me how underused his character was in the story. It's brilliant how it puts together all the pieces of the past films that remained a mystery, such as the whereabouts of Mr. White and the origin of 'Quantum', and reveals that everything in the past has happened by the hand of Blofeld's secret organisation 'Spectre', but it's so underwhelming to see how the apparently most dangerous man in the world is defeated so easily and how Bond effortlessly puts a stop to his activities. I don't want to say that this mission was impossible, but his potential to be the evil arch nemesis who would most likely manage to defeat James basically crashes with a helicopter and is taken under arrest so easily. You know what I mean? He's brilliantly portrayed, but at the same time criminally underused and no big deal at all. All in all, this Bond film took a few steps back and offers a mediocre story with a few highlights, but also many aspects that I declare as wasted potential. It's still a massive pleasure to experience, as it still uses the basic formula that works out just fine, but it sadly lacks the sentimentality and emotionality that made its predecessor stand out. What I said, just fine, not brilliant. What bothers me the most is how it could have been magnificent, but now is far away from the high quality 'Skyfall' has offered. In the end, it neither terrible nor outstanding. Nonetheless, I'm absolutely stoked for the final outing. Can't wait for November.",7,0,0,23 March 2020
The Great Gatsby," It's true to the book and looks fabulous - isn't that enough?
","'The Great Gatsby' is a 2013 drama directed by Baz Luhrmann starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire. One and a half year ago years ago, I already gave this novel adaption a watch and thought it was good, but not as outstanding as I hoped it to be. Well, it was during a phase I always expected every single DiCaprio feature to be a masterpiece, so that is what probably shattered my expectations back in the day. Another factor that contributed to my confusion and misunderstanding of the film was probably that, at that time, I haven't even heard about the original novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald this film is based on. I don't even know what lead me to give the adaption a watch without having read the book beforehand, as it is totally antithetic to my general habit of reading the source material first. Mostly, I want to do it in order to be able to draw a comparison between the two and since I felt that the character of Jay Gatsby still fascinated me immensely afterwards and strangely even more recently, I decided to purchase the original novel by Fitzgerald and give it a read. Well, even though it was in the English language (as I said, I bought the original version) I was able to comprehend and finish it within only four days. From start to the tragic ending, I was absolutely absorbed by it and it was almost impossible for me to put it down in any way. What Fitzgerald created is legitimately one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century. The lifelike characters, the dramatic conflict, the way he puts all of this in words are just wonderful and beautifully formulated. Even if I finished the novel in less than a week, the characters grew dear to my heart and I miss them. It is strange what great literature can achieve, isn't it? With the impact it made on me still in mind, I then decided to give it a rewatch under those new circumstances. To my amazement, the film did not become worse to me, quite the contrary, it became even better. It was my advantage that I knew about the story this time and it shows. While it still isn't a perfect film, I am brave enough to claim that it is technically a perfect adaptation. The characters are exactly like I pictured them in my head (while Daisy looked more like Michelle Williams in my imagination) and the actors and actresses portraying them don't just play them, they embody them. DiCaprio is brilliant as the titular mysterious millionaire, Maguire plays the role of the observing Nick Carraway wonderfully and Carey Mulligan is magnificent as the irresolute twofold beloved. Also, Elizabeth Debicki was born for the role of Jordan Baker, but the biggest surprise is the man who portrays the antagonistic brute Tom Buchanan. You probably can relate when you have a few actors that you just can't bear to see onscreen for no particular reason, in my case, one of them is Joel Edgerton. Might it be his disastrous acting in 'Gods Of Egypt' (where I encountered him first), but I am genuinely unable to stand him as an actor. Not him as person, I don't know him personally and he probably is a nice guy, but as an artist I just dislike him. That is why I am so tremendously impressed by him in this film, as he managed to make me reduce my aversion towards him with just one performance. What I am trying to say is that each and every role was perfectly casted, not only in terms of outer appearance, but also their talent. They all embody the characteristics of their respective roles seemingly flawlessly, as if they had just jumped out of my brain into the screen. The authenticity and perfect depiction of the protagonists isn't the only thing this film managed to adapt superbly, it is also they story that amazes me. Let's put it this way, the film is incredibly true to its source material and shows every single scene of the novel, just. It is getting to the point that roughly more than seventy percent of the spoken dialogue is taken directly from the novel and I am asking you: What more could you wish for? You get exactly what you know from the original source and you can see all of it coming to life - literally! For hardcore fans, there are also several small details to spot that were derived from the novel that are not mentioned directly by the characters, but were extensively described in the book (Gatsby looking at Daisy for thirty seconds - they made that shot exactly as long, for instance). I guess what probably many people couldn't deal with was the admittedly weird and frantic directorial style of Luhrmann, but as a huge fan of 'Moulin Rouge' I am used to his weirdness. Of course, a few scenes are run through extremely fast, especially in the beginning and that made it uncomfortable to watch, but aside from this, the rest of the story is perfectly paced in my opinion - just as it is in the novel. If there is one unforgivable transgression in this movie, it without a doubt must be the music used in this film. From all the beautiful classic songs that Fitzgerald mentioned in his novel they had to use pop music from the twenty-first century. In the name of God, why? In the case of 'Moulin Rouge' it was somewhat charming that they deliberately created anachronisms by including chart hits from the eighties and nineties, but that fitted in the context of the overall surreal nature of the film, in this case it absolutely does not. It was utterly ridiculous to see the people in a serious drama that takes place in 1922 dance to 'A Little Party Never Killed nobody' by Fergie. It seriously disturbed the authenticity that was build up before. Fortunately, this atrocity happened to occur only in the beginning and fades to the background from there on. Well, at least the overall style of the film makes up for this massive misstep. I mean, come on: The visual, the costumes and the cinematography masterfully capture the pompousness and fabulousness, but also the hidden vulnerability and melancholy of the story and are exactly as Fitzgerald has pictured them. The Academy Awards for the best achievement in costume design and production design are more than deserved, least to say. It isn't only that, they also managed to capture the quintessence of the conflict of Jay Gatsby who glorifies the past, is obsessed with elusive ideas and eventually dies as a martyr. Like the novel did, the ending of the film made me incredibly sad as well and makes the same disillusioning statement as the author made: Money and wealth always prevail over personality. Yes, the same social criticism that Fitzgerald shows off in this adaptation as well and still hits at the correct spots. All in all, this romantic drama is not only exceedingly wonderful to look at and caries causing eye-candy, it also knows how to treat its complex source material with immense respect (except for the choice of songs, of course) and masterly adds enough to make it more conclusive for the audience of the film (like making Nick the author of the 'novel', for example). It without a doubt is exactly the same as the novel and hasn't changed a bit, and in my opinion this is what makes it so incredibly enjoyable. The thing is, while reimagining something you can never please everyone. While adapting a literary source you will never be able to please all: There are some that say that adopting the source material one-to-one simply shows the lack of creativity, there are also some thinking that heavily changing it is an expression of disrespect. Whatever you do, you just can't win. I personally think that both ways are indeed possible to master and might create a great film and in this case it is just brilliant to see an exact realization. I mean, you also don't go to a Shakespeare play and complain that it is the same as in the books, you know? To someone who deeply loves the original novel, this adaptation is perfect and deserves more appreciation. It is neither too long, nor too short (the end credits run for almost 13 minutes (!), so don't be discouraged by the runtime) and doesn't feel boring at all. Not even once. It is a perfect adaptation but no perfect movie, still I think it is heavily underrated.",8,1,1,4 June 2020
Evil Dead II," Ash VS The Evil Hand
","'Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn' is a 1987 horror comedy directed by Sam Raimi starring Bruce Campbell and ... . When it comes to categorising this flick the people still argue to this day: Is it a remake or is it a sequel? I would say it both, it's sort of a remake and obviously a sequel. When I watched it for the first time I was highly confused how it's only loosely based on the horrifying events of its predecessor. Now that I know that it's the result of legal issues I can appreciate the production. While the first movie was pure gory horror, Raimi decided to go in another and more experimental direction with this one. The hilarious genre mix of splatter, slapstick and stop motion animation delivers absolutely weird fun. The first act shows us the fight of the charismatic lone survivor, as he deals with both his declining mental health and the supernatural possessing forces. It shows how great of a comedy actor Campbell is, as he dominates the scene for almost half and hour. With enough jokes and humourous ideas (Ash vs. The Evil Hand!) it offers a unique pleasure, but with the start of the second act the horror begins to show itself. While the atmosphere isn't as packing as it's predecessor's, there are enough gruesome and gory effects to terrorise the audience (Henrietta!). Most of it might be over the top, but that's why it works so well. I mean, a guy with a chainsaw prothesis and shotgun! What do you want more? All in all, this one might not be the perfect sequel for everyone, it definitely doesn't come close to the original, but if you embrace the madness and love the style of Raimi, you're in for hell of fun.

V for Vendetta," You don't have to cover your face to wear a mask...
","'V For Vendetta' is a 2005 comic book drama directed by James McTeigue starring Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. As it is sort of a holiday for cinephiles and most of us tend to rewatch it on that particular date, I tried to give it a first time watch myself this year, but unfortunately I had to postpone it due to a punk concert I've visited instead, but now - a few days later - coincidentally on a date that bears a tremendous political importance in Germany, I finally got to see it. So I think this will make it up to it. First of all, this film shows us a dystopian society that has a lot in common with several classic novels. Unfortunately though, there's not enough to it that makes it distinct, it's not as well elaborated as I hoped it would be. There's no explanation of why it happened and doesn't offer any chance to learn about the circumstances. But that's only a minor flaw. What I think was excellently done is the dialogue and the meaning behind every single line. It's so tremendously intelligent and thought provoking and the choice of words is only superb. It effects the viewer to intensively think about the own society one lives in. Furthermore, it's alarming to see how the corrupt government misuses the media for their own, misleading interests and how it is close to it's real-life counterpart at times. It's actually sad to say that the reality doesn't always differ from what is depicted in here. Next to this, the sensational cast really shows that it has top-class actors and actresses in its ranks, especially Portman and Weaving (is it even him, though? Serious question) and it's stylishly filmed and captured the essence of the graphic novel very well. It doesn't recoil to tackle highly inconvenient topics, such as propaganda, mistreatment of human beings and media and the abuse of power. Also, it offers a lot of highly quotable exclamations, but there's still one big issue that prevents it from being a masterpiece: The narrative structure. The film is way to long in general and it has too many scenes that should have been either cut or shortened, but as they are still in the final cut, they perturb the storytelling tremendously. The absolutely well worded scenes and following actions would have had way more impact and would have striked the chord way more unpleasantly if it didn't have so many lengths in it. The buildup of tension was immensely disrupted my multiple scenes that simply lasted to long and, as harsh as it sound, made the tension vanish on several occasions. Each time it seemed to reach the perfect level again, it failed to do so. After seeing this happen a few time it was frustrating. The final act though redeemed the overall unbalanced second act and showed the brilliance it had in the first act. Additionally, it didn't reach the emotional depth I was hoping to see, but that's just mentioned casually. All in all, this dystopian drama knows what it stands for and offers the right approaches, appropriate performances and twists and extremely intelligent lines, besides the disastrous storytelling it's an enjoyable and important flick that makes us reflect our own view to our own society. It's no masterpiece and it's such a pity that it had so much potential to be one.",7,2,3,9 November 2019
