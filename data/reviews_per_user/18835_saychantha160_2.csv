It," Can't wait for a sequel.
","Good acting from the children & Pennywise. Hair stood up in a lot of scenes. This isn't the typical horror movie with pop ups, which is what I like because it can be redundant. This is a 2 hour film so expect a lot of character buildup and history of Pennywise in the small town of Derry. It compares to other original slasher/killer films because you can feel him, see him, and he can be defeated. It literally feels like an 80s horror flick in modern time, like stranger things. They do show IT plenty of times in the film, always constantly stalking each child with fear, so it never gets boring. Way better than the original there are more scenes that was from the book, like the opening scene, they added more lines to Pennywise and extended that scene. Cgi looks terrifying because it matches with the theme of the movie and atmosphere, dark and grim. This movie deserves to have a sequel because I was always on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens next.",10,4,13,10 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Great buildup to an epic fight
","Wow, I was amazed of how the writers built the story for Batman and Superman. I am not a comic reader but there was enough lore for the heroes that kept me interested. In the first few minutes it was just storytelling but that is what makes a movie good. Then the last hour or so there was nothing but action. Great buildup to the fight & loved Ben Affleck as Batman. In my opinion he is a far better choice than Christian Bale. This Batman does not have the corny voice, his voice sounds more natural. Superman was a force of nature that was difficult to stop. Great movie, acting & story just go watch it don't listen to the other ratings!!!",9,3,6,29 March 2016
