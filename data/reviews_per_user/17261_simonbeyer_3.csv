Raiders of the Lost Ark," A fantastic adventure!
","'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' is one of a kind. There has never been a movie like it and there never will be. The movie closest to it is 'Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade'. It is an absolute masterpiece. It has everything: love, action, excitement, adventure and so on. This movie can be seen a thousand times - it NEVER gets boring. Every time you start watching you just get sucked into the world of Indiana Jones for two hours. You feel the adrenaline pumping when he fights against nazis, big men with swords, indians, snakes and a thousand other things. It is a true adventure, Indy is the perfect example of a masculine hero. Director Steven Spielberg is an absolute genius - he has managed to make a movie where every second is thrilling! I can only give it my warmest recommendations.",10,0,0,20 May 2001
The Usual Suspects," A rather boring movie.
","I don't like this movie. I think it's extremely boring. The first time I saw it I just kept on thinking 'When is something actually going to happen?' Most of the movie they just talk and talk. The ending is fine, but the rest of the movie cannot at all stand up to it. I guess the director and scriptwriters had a very bad day when they decided to make this movie. That day they made a mistake - the movie should never have been made. My recommendation: don't see Usual Suspects, it's a complete waste of time.",1,18,33,20 May 2001
The Usual Suspects," A piece of crap!
","This movie is nothing but a complete waste of time. There is absolutely no logic in the story, the characters are boring and everything is mixed together and that makes the movie very confusing and extremely boring.
Five stupid men are the main characters, and all they do is talk about stupid things in a boring way. Occasionally the director puts in a little stupid action which makes no particular sense.Overall: A very clumsy attempt to make a crime movie. And I'm sorry that it isn't possible to vote less than 1 for this movie failure. It's a disgrace to the whole movie industry.If you want to see a brilliant crime movie you should try 'Seven' or 'The Silence Of The Lambs'. True classics!",1,20,42,26 September 2001
