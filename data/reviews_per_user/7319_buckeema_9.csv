The Avengers," A star-studded cast assemble to create the greatest superhero movie of all time...
","Superman: The Movie, The Dark Knight and The Avengers. Yes 'The Avengers' does indeed stand tall amongst the greatest superhero movies of all time.A stellar cast assemble to create a marvel of a film, pun definitely intended. The special effects are top notch and never look out of place like superhero movies of the past. However it is truly the story that is most appreciated since it is the final act of an intricate tightly woven plot that has been building through the current generation of Marvel films (Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger) and ends with the best superhero finale ever conceived for the big screen. Yes its that good. The only factor that could have been reduced was the amount of humour and sarcasm following certain kick-ass scenes which could have benefited with a touch of cool. In retrospect the humour mostly gets it right and compliments the 'comic book' feel of the movie, which is what we have all desperately wanted for so long: A comic book movie that truly sets your mind free like the comic books and cartoons we all read and watched growing up thinking anything was possible.I applaud you Marvel as 'The Avengers' now stands as one of the greatest, if not the greatest superhero movie of all time.",10,7,15,6 May 2012
The Hunger Games," The Hollywood hype machine goes into overdrive, and fails miserably..
","Oh the hype! Everywhere I looked in the weeks leading up to the release of 'The Hunger Games' I saw poster after poster showing some girl with a bow and arrow.. It was everywhere and still is. Hollywood is really pushing this one on the public obviously because of the popularity of the books, and the guaranteed fan base they can absorb money from. I never read the books, the advertisements were in my face at every turn, so I decided to check it out and see for myself if the hype was true.What I got was a mediocre movie with the only thing standing out was the acting by Jennifer Lawrence. That's it. She's good, no doubts about it, but not great by any means. The beginning of the movie was nice in the way it built things up, but the latter was a let down, and the movie as a whole could never live up to the hype that proceeded it.All in all the movie is a money-making machine created to become a multi-movie franchise that Hollywood will milk until there's nothing left to suck from the tit.",5,7,10,30 March 2012
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Man 3 is an effects spectacle with a satisfactory conclusion to a great trilogy...
","Spider-Man 3 is without a doubt the most hyped film of 2007. It was the first trailer to give me shivers since I saw the (Star Wars) Episode 3 trailer, and I simply couldn't wait for the arrival of one of the greatest villains in comic book history... Venom.I went to see it on opening day and of course I had huge expectations, I mean Spider-Man 2 was great, and it seemed like Sam Raimi could do no wrong to this flourishing franchise.So the lights dimmed, and the show began... I have to say I was thrilled with the first half of the film. The first fight between Peter and Harry was ground-breaking as I was witnessing a Special FX phenomenon right in front of my very eyes, and that was only the first of many eye-popping moments.As the movie continued the story's characters became more intertwined and the conclusion was approaching. Everything up until the conclusion was extremely well done. Many of my initial first questions were answered: Topher Grace was indeed a good Eddie Brock and Thomas Haden Church was the best possible casting for Sandman. Let me just say this: The villains in this film are downright amazing.Then the final 2-on-2 fight scene began. It really is a comic book lover's dream come to the big screen. The action reminded me of watching the Spider-Man cartoon and just being sucked into that crazy Comic book-World.I would have given this film an 8.5 out of 10 since I'm a huge Spider-Man fan, but once again like Bryan Singer did with the X-Men films, Sam Raimi took a drastic turn from the Comic book storyline and killed off Venom in one of the last sequences in the film. Sam Raimi originally never wanted Venom in the film, and only incorporated him for the fans. So it angers me he would kill Venom off simply due to his personal resentment for the character. In the comic books and cartoon series (for all of you who had never read or watched Spider-Man prior to the films) Venom never dies, but simply 'dissapears' for times due to Spider-Man rattling up his symbiote suit with a loud noise (like the bell or poles in the movie). However if you watch the scene where Venom dies his rib cage disintegrates in the blast.I simply can't believe they would kill off such a great villain, where in the movie Raimi spent so much time with the suit and Topher Grace.Very Disappointing. However I have read (off IGN.com) that someone who dies in Spider-Man 3 could have survived... Lets cross our fingers and hope somehow a piece of the symbiote survived with Eddie's DNA and it can somehow form into Eddie's body at any point... Kinda like Sandman does in the film.",7,0,1,10 May 2007
Toy Story 4," Toy Story 3 ended perfectly. Had an opened mind when I saw this, but this was a cash grab plain and simple.
","Like many franchises these days, this franchise had the perfect send off with an earlier film but the execs felt the need to pump another out that does nothing whatsoever to enhance the story.",1,4,12,20 January 2020
Cars," Pixar uses the same formula over and over... Anyone else sick of it yet?
","I went and saw the premiere of Pixar's newest animated film: CARS. Like all CG Animated films this one was no different with the lame jokes that TRY to appease the stressed out parent who had to bring their kid to the movie. TOY STORY was original for it's time, and I have nothing against it since it was a breakthrough in CG animated films, but Pixar seems to think people are oblivious to the fact that they have repeated the same story arc in most of there films.1. There's the obvious GUY wants GIRL plot.2. Jokes that try to appeal to both parents and kids. Key word: TRY.3. The transformation from good hearted to HERO status.It's a very simple formula, and this movie does have it's moments (just like any other movie), but really makes you realize that the CLASSIC aspects of animated film are fading away into oblivion.Films like the Lion King, and Beauty and the Beast are REAL animated classics, and CARS is definitely just another film that will be forgotten as CG gets more and more realistic over the years. Just like how films with CG (Star Wars: EP 1) look terribly dated now.Still go out and see it since it's a decent summer movie, but It's no classic. It's disappointing to know that Disney has lost its creative drive it had when it dominated the 2D (hand drawn) industry. Just IMAGINE how great a 2D film could look in these modern days. Go and watch Princess Mononoke (directed by Hayao Miyazaki), and you'll understand why 2D will always remain more genuine and timeless.",5,3,21,9 June 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-MEN 3 is the best of the Trilogy but fails to deliver the greatness of the COMICS
","X-MEN: The Last Stand, is a fun summer movie, but contains none of the great aspects that the COMIC BOOKS incorporated. This is a trend that can be seen throughout all the films. Every major X-MEN fan knows why the films failed. Where was the original costumes? Where was all the diverse characters? Where are the cool powers and the unique personalities that clash? Well none of these aspects are there, and that is ultimately why this film fails.Why can't these bigwig Hollywood producers realize that to make a great comic book film, all you need to do is simply copy the comic page for page, because the story boards and great dialogue are all there. I really hope one day producers realize this, instead of ruining popular franchises like X-MEN that could have ended up being great adaptations.Bryan Singer directed the first 2 films and he said he was a huge fan of the X-MEN COMICS, yet there's nothing relating to the comics at all. This trilogy is a huge disappointment to the kids who grew up reading the comics, and watching the classic 90's animated series.The only good things within these films are some of the action scenes and performances. Notably: Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Famke Janssen as Jean Grey & Patrick Stewart as Professor X. Ian McKellen is a good actor, but is simply way to old to be playing the part of Magneto. Bryan Singer is planning to work on ULTIMATE X-MEN the movie, which I hope he doesn't ruin this time around.",6,0,0,5 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," ROTS finally lives up to all the hype the Star Wars Prequels should have delivered...
","The Prequel Trilogy is Complete with the final installment re-assuring us Star Wars fans that George Lucas is still very capable of making a true Space Opera like he did with Star Wars: A New Hope, which was the only film he directed in the Original Trilogy.Star Wars: Episode III  Revenge of the Sith brings all the components which made the original movies work, and puts them together to make a single film that incorporates the style and thrill of what any viewer would expect from such a well known name as 'Star Wars'.ROTS begins with an epic space battle over the city planet of Coruscant, which starts the movie off with an adrenaline rush no other Star Wars film has ever offered. This opening 20 minute action scene thrusts the movie in an unstoppable direction which gets darker and grimmer to the very end. Many critics thought Lucas would take it a bit easy on Anakin's fall to the dark side, however Lucas creates a much darker 'fall' then any Star Wars fan would ever have expected.As for performances go Hayden Christensen finally gets my approval as being cast as Anakin Skywalker since he simply shows a maturity not seen in Episode II, which helps you realize Lucas' plan for the viewer to see how Anakin matures throughout the films. Simply watch the film 'Life as a House' to see how well Christensen plays a dysfunctional character. I can't stress enough how important Ewan McGregor has been to the Prequel Trilogy, since his strong performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi has been the only positive factor leading up to ROTS. So to see him basically BECOME Obi-Wan from the Original Trilogy is a great feeling, since its accompanied by a strong film with amazing effect shots that should definitely take home the Oscar for Best Special Effects. Last but not least Ian McDiarmid SHINES as Emperor Palpatine giving a performance that leaves the viewer uneasy and skeptical of his dark intentions as McDiarmid shows confidence and a true sense of evil like never before.There's almost too much to say about ROTS, because every aspect of the movie is so interesting to watch, since we all wanna know how a goodhearted man goes completely evil within 2 ½ hours. What really makes the movie captivating is the 'events' that take place which change the Galaxy forever. For example: the scene when Anakin runs in on Mace Windu fighting the Emperor. Mace Windu has the Sith Master defeated and wants to finish him off, however Anakin wants the Emperor to stand a fair trial like the ways of the Jedi so the Emperor can teach Anakin how to save his wife from death. Mace knows the Emperor has too much power and has to kill him right away. So when Mace winds up to finish him off, Anakin intervenes by cutting off Mace's hand leading to his electrifying death. This single scene demonstrates how close it came to the Sith being destroyed. Scenes like this make ROTS the most intriguing and exciting Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi.",10,4,9,7 July 2005
Prometheus," 'Prometheus' isn't for your average moviegoer..
","Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' isn't a fun summer movie for the masses, but a serious sci-fi film that makes you think about it long after its finished, leaving questions unanswered, ultimately putting the viewer in a situation where they must come up with their own perspective of what the film means as it incorporates many religious and ancient themes.If you want to watch a sci-fi movie that challenges your intellect and pushes you to think outside of the box, then this is the movie for you. It's unconventional and I love it. The Visuals and art design are outstanding and the story has so many elements to it that its hard to read what's happening all at once, but that's why it's so great: It makes you think after and talk about it.'Prometheus' is a prequel that makes the universe of 'Alien' that much more interesting, but at the same time making all those 'Alien vs. Predator' spin-offs look horrible and gimmicky.This is the definitive 'Alien' film and anything else that follows it will most likely not surpass this gem, as Ridley Scott has just set the bar, once again, extremely high.",10,5,21,15 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises one last time to save Gotham City...
","You can all rest easy now.. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is the 3rd and final movie of the Christoper Nolan-directed trilogy and it was a great feeling seeing it finish in grand fashion.There was no way it was going to surpass 'The Dark Knight' and the iconic performance of Heath ledger as the 'The Joker', but it comes incredibly close and mostly delivers with the assistance of 'Bane'; the last major villain of the franchise. Actor Tom Hardy does the role justice as the voice itself is creepy and haunting and sets the tone of the entire film, as Batman is caught in the darkest of struggles.Then there's Anne Hathaway's portrayal of 'Catwoman' which surprised me and added a bit of fun to the otherwise dark film, however she doesn't surpass the utter brilliance of Michelle Pheifer's 'Catwoman' in Tim Burton's 'Batman Returns' which is still the definitive version of the character.All in all the movie was a lot of fun to watch since we've all been waiting to see how it all ends, and trust me it was well worth the wait! I congratulate Christopher Nolan for making a trilogy that is connected beginning to end and is now the most compelling take on the 'batman' that we've ever witnessed on the big screen.",8,372,704,16 July 2012
