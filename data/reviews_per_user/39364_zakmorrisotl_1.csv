Hereditary," The kind of horror that lasts
","Let me start this off by saying I did not enjoy The Witch. Too slow of a burn for me. Hereditary on the other hand was brilliant. Started off slow which had me worried but this movie was more willing to explore the supernatural element and when they went for it, they really went for it. No cheap scares here, thick tension building atmosphere and bread crumbs of clues lead up to one of the most intense final acts I have seen in awhile. An instant classic in my book, a horror movie that takes it self seriously (as does every actor and actress involved) and demands your respect. Go see this film.",10,72,150,8 June 2018
