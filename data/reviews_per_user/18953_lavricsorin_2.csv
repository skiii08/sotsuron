Blade Runner 2049," A hard movie!
","A hard movie! A film that is not for any SF fan. I just liked some parts and ideas from the movie and I can say it's OK but a LONG movie! I have not seen the purpose of these long scenes ... probably if they did it for an hour and a half it was perfect. Try it, it's worth it, but it's not for any fan of SF movies .... for me it was just 'So-so' - note 5 of 10.",5,2,4,4 April 2018
