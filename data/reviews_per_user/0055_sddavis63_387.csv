"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," A Rather Preposterous Story With At Best Mild Humour
","To start off with the obvious - you cannot start training for a marathon three weeks before the race (having never run - not having never run a marathon but having never run competitively) - and expect to have any chance in the world of actually finishing the race. So, right off the top there was a general lack of credibility here. I had to couple that with my immediate distaste for the 'hero' of the story (Dennis, played by Simon Pegg) who, in the opening scenes, skips out of his wedding to his pregnant fiancé (he later tries to weasel out of the responsibility for that by telling Libby that he chose to ruin her day to avoid ruining her life - except that the opening of the movie clearly portrays a Dennis who is scared sh****ss at the prospect of marriage. In other words, he wasn't thinking of Libby - he just ran away to avoid living up to his responsibility.) Dennis then becomes a sort of sympathetic character thanks only to the introduction of the truly obnoxious American Whit (played by Hank Azaria) who steals Libby's heart, and starts to replace Dennis in the eyes of his son. To bring Whit down to size, Dennis ends up running against him in a charity marathon (running for erectile dysfunction - yeah, pretty typical of the level of the humour here.) Filled with an assortment of other strange characters, this movie ended up being a major disappointment to me. 4/10",4,0,1,19 May 2009
The Devil's Advocate," Far-Fetched, But It Works
","Keanu Reeves plays Kevin Lomax, a young Florida attorney who makes a name for himself by winning - all the time - even when defending some less than savoury characters, and even though he has to battle personal demons (no pun intended) as his conscience is continually wounded by his business. After one particularly noteworthy courtroom victory, he's approached by a prestigious New York law firm headed by - wait for it - old Satan himself, played superbly and hilariously by Al Pacino. Pacino alone makes it worth watching this movie. He shines as the Prince of Darkness. Although the movie isn't really intended as a comedy, it's a hilarious parody of the law profession as we note how easily the devil fits into this particular line of work.A very strong cast backs up Pacino and Reeves. Charlize Theron plays Mary Ann (Lomax's lonely wife,) who is excited at first about moving to New York, then learns to truly hate the place. Jeffrey Jones puts on an interesting performance as Eddie Barzoon, the managing director of the firm - interesting because he did a pretty good job and made a definite impression even though he played a character who I thought was very poorly developed. Tamara Tunie put on a wondrously sultry and sensual performance as Jackie Heath, the wife of one of Lomax's new law partners, who befriends Mary Ann.No doubt this is about as far-fetched as they come, but the ending - which I have to confess I didn't see coming - makes some of that understandable. It's entertaining throughout. I'd give it an 8/10.",8,1,2,9 June 2002
The Blair Witch Project," Imaginative And Pretty Effective
","Although the style has become fairly common, at the time this movie was released, the idea of a simple movie filmed in a documentary style using a single hand held camera was pretty imaginative, and to give the makers of this film their proper credit, no one since has mastered the raw style as effectively. The story is a simple one. Three college students learn of a Maryland legend about the “Blair Witch” and they set out for a weekend in the woods to investigate the stories.The film starts out in a light-hearted manner, showing the trio joking around as they prepare for their adventure, then doing some background interviews with residents of the nearby town of Burkittsville, which adds some horror-type mystery and “history” to the project. There wasn't much excitement in that opening, but it established that the three didn't take the legends seriously and that they weren't expecting much more than a weekend in the woods. At first we watch essentially a routine nature hike, but the suspense builds pretty quickly once the three realize they're lost. Then they begin to hear mysterious sounds at night and stumble upon strange things by day - unusual rock piles, and the now famous Blair Witch symbol made out of sticks and hanging from trees. The movie never tries to explain these things, focusing instead on the increasing terror felt by the campers. There's an interesting study of group dynamics as the three respond to their plight by increasingly turning on each other. The climax of the movie starts when Josh goes missing. He's nowhere to be found, but Heather and Bill hear him calling to them. Their search finally leads them unexpectedly to a crumbling old house. There's something terrifying in the house, but it's never revealed, the filming stopping suddenly when Heather comes across Bill staring at something. In the story, the three are never found, but the camera and film are found a year later.I realize this was in keeping with the genre, but I would have liked a bit more resolution. The movie leaves you with your heart pumping but no explanation of what happened. Still, the film is effective at building suspense and presents a frighteningly creepy feel once the kids realize that they're lost, and the three do a great job of portraying their increasing fear and desperation. The college documentary project angle also shields the film from the typical, ”low budget' criticisms. Altogether, it's pretty effective. 7/10",7,2,3,7 November 2009
The King's Speech," Solid But Unspectacular
","In opening, I must say that everyone involved with this production did a solid job. They all did their duty. In that sense, the movie resembles the British royal family as a whole - they're not especially important really, but they perform a useful function that fate has assigned them to. The trappings of monarchy aside, I suspect that their lives are probably rather dull and largely scripted. That brief description of royal life and duty sums this movie up perfectly.There's really nothing wrong with it. Colin Firth was believable as King George VI, Helena Bonham Carter good (if, I thought, a little too irreverent in places) as his wife Elizabeth. George was the second son of King George V. As such, he was never supposed to be King, never trained to be King and afflicted with a terrible speech impediment that probably made him relieved to know that he would never be King, with all the public duties entailed with the office. Then - the abdication crisis, as his brother King Edward VIII gives up the throne for the woman he loves (the American divorcée Wallis Simpson) leaving poor Bertie (as George was known) to take up the reins and the responsibility of rallying the nation as Britain and its Empire slide toward inevitable war with Nazi Germany.The movie begins with Bertie's disastrous and almost incoherent 1925 speech at Wembley and ends with a still hesitant but nevertheless eloquent speech declaring war on Germany in 1939. In between, the movie essentially deals with the speech therapy that Bertie received from the Australian Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush.) It isn't really all that interesting to witness almost two hours of speech therapy, but one has to feel a certain sympathy for Bertie as he faces this situation that to him must have been terrifying as well as a certain admiration for him - unlike his brother, he sucked it up and overcame his weaknesses and limitations and did his duty. Firth did an admirable job of drawing us into the King's emotional torment as he takes on this role he never wanted. So, while the movie as a whole isn't exciting or - at times at least - even particularly interesting, it's solid. I personally don't think it rises beyond that, and I think it's somewhat over-rated. But it's solid. Just like the royals themselves, it does its duty, even if it does so unspectacularly.",6,43,68,20 January 2011
Despicable Me 2," A Good Story And It Left Me With Tears In My Eyes From Laughing
","I am truly delighted to see that this movie gets a good rating. So many good animated films get low ratings I suspect because adults just don't get them. Obviously people are getting 'Despicable Me 2.' I just left the theatre not too long ago, and it's one of the few times that I've had a movie leave with with tears in my eyes from laughing. It's a very funny movie - one that gets funnier as it moves along; one whose funniest moments in my opinion (and from the laughter in the theatre) came at the very end. It's a tremendously worthy sequel to the original, which was also very good. In fact, I think I enjoyed this more than I did the original.The villain Gru is back once again, but this time he's more of an anti- villain. He's busy playing daddy to the three little girls he adopted in the first movie, and he's turned his crime lab into a jam and jelly making factory. But an unknown villain appears on the scene threatening the world, and Gru is recruited by the 'Anti-Villain League' to use his villainous expertise to find out who it is. He's partnered with Lucy, who - predictably enough - becomes a love interest for him. But somehow the 'romance' doesn't distract from the story the way they so often do. It added to the story. It gave us a better sense of Gru - who he was and where he came from. It worked surprisingly well.And, of course, there are the minions. All sorts of minions. Everywhere and all over and in almost every scene it seemed. And they're just as funny as they were in the first movie as well.The best part of this is that it's not just a cartoon, and it's not just for kids, and it's not a weak sequel. It has a story to it; a plot that actually works and keeps the viewer surprisingly interested all the way through. Everybody involved with this deserves credit for putting out a winner. My one piece of advice is not to simply get up and leave when the credits start to roll! (9/10)",9,1,4,5 July 2013
The Mask," Jim Carrey And Not Much Else
","Jim Carrey is - as always - excellent in this movie that features little else to commend itself to viewers. Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a shy and awkward bank employee whose life is changed when he finds and dons a mysterious mask that brings out all of his innermost feelings and desires. In short, he becomes everything he wishes he was - and finds that he's better off as who he is. Perhaps a good lesson in life for all those who wish their lives were different. But this movie didn't go for any serious message. It went for laughs, and in doing so featured - at best - sophomoric humour (which is sometimes hilarious and sometimes painfully bad.) Combined with lacklustre performances from the rest of the cast, what emerged was a mediocre film which broadly resembles a big cartoon. I watched this movie with my 8 year old niece. She thought it was great. That should tell you something right there. This is definitely a movie for the younger set. If you don't have an 8 year old to watch it with, I frankly wouldn't bother.",5,2,13,15 July 2001
Moneyball," Baseball By The Numbers
","My first comment would be to warn people who aren't big baseball fans that this is a baseball movie. In fact, it's not even so much about baseball - it's about the behind the scenes machinations involved in building a baseball team. There's very little onfield action depicted, so unless the idea of watching the management team rather than the players really turns your crank, this likely won't be for you. Personally, I'm not a huge baseball fan. I follow the game, I know the teams and the big name players, but I'm not a fanatic. So I approach this movie from that perspective.In 2001, the Oakland A's went 102-60, but then lost in the playoffs. They then had several of their best players leave after the season, because they didn't have enough money to pay them, and General Manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) was forced to try to keep the team competitive on what would be generously described as a shoestring budget. Without the money to pay for the best players, Beane recruits a young executive from the Cleveland Indians named Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill) and together they try to craft a winning team strictly by the numbers - using in depth statistical analysis to determine not so much the biggest names but the best fits for their particular team, and we watch as the 2002 season unfolds.There are things about this movie that I liked. Brad Pitt for one. I thought his performance as Beane was very good and very believable. What I also found believable was the tension that rose between Beane and the team's scouts as well as manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) - all of whom were 'old school' baseball people who didn't understand what Beane and Brand were trying to do and weren't especially co-operative. The behind the scenes look was as interesting as it could be, I suppose - especially the glimpse at how players are rated and evaluated and treated.But I have to admit that this movie still didn't really appeal to me. First, I'm not a baseball fanatic, and in my opinion this is a niche movie for a niche audience. I appreciated that Beane kept the team winning, but to be honest they didn't actually win anything of importance (and still haven't.) Yes, the team pulled off an amazing 20- game winning streak in 2002, but they lost in the playoffs and as Beane himself said, nothing matters if you don't win the last game of the season. That's true. I'm enough of a baseball fan that I'm sure I noticed in the summer of 2002 that the A's were on a massive, mega- winning streak, but I don't actually remember it 10 years later. I guess in the end that's what really makes me scratch my head over this movie. It's just not especially important. As much as this was supposed to be a new way of building a team - frankly, it doesn't work. With no salary cap, baseball is about money. Yes, the movie suggests that the Boston Red Sox used the system Beane and the A's developed, but it leaves out an important point - the Red Sox used the system - AND MONEY! The title is accurate. Baseball is about money. The American League especially is divided into 3 groups - the Yankees and the Red Sox (one or both of whom will be in the playoffs because they have a lot of money and can buy the best players); their division rivals the Rays, Blue Jays and Orioles, who (aside from a massive upset periodically) can't compete with them over a full 162 game season and who start every season knowing that they're going to end up on the outside looking in; and everybody else, who compete to be the best of the rest and hope to be able to beat the Yankees or Red Sox in a 3 of 5 or 4 of 7 series. This isn't a bad movie, but I for one thought it was massively over- rated. It's neither overly interesting nor overly important, and why anyone would have thought of it as a nominee for Best Picture I have no idea. (5/10)",5,1,1,31 January 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," The Fun Of The Original Turns To Silliness In The Sequel
","The original 'National Treasure' was fast-paced and fun all the way through. Like many sequels, 'Book of Secrets' lost some of the magic that deemed it worthy to spawn a sequel in the first place. This film wasn't as well paced as the original (actually, by the time the lost city was finally found my attention had wandered so many times that I had trouble piecing together the steps that had brought them there!) The basic plot, revolving around the search for this lost city of gold that led from Washington to France to England to South Dakota, wasn't as compelling as the original, either, and to be honest fell on what I considered to be the extremely silly side, the chief silliness being perhaps the account of Gates kidnapping the president to have him help in the treasure hunt.As for the performances, Nicolas Cage was once again fine as the head treasure hunter Ben Gates, but some of the spark between him and Diane Kruger (again playing Abigail) seemed missing.Justin Bartha added comic relief as Ben's sidekick Riley, as did Jon Voigt as his dad. Helen Mirren and Ed Harris rounded out the cast, as Ben's mom and chief nemesis respectively, and handled their parts well enough.Basically, I'd characterize this as an average movie with some good action scenes saddled with a plot of limited substance. 5/10",5,0,0,22 December 2008
Angels & Demons," Professor Langdon Saves The Vatican From Itself
","As one who appreciates the use of irony, I have to admit that it was the use of irony that really made this movie work for me. Where the original story in the series - 'The Da Vinci Code' (which I thought it was taken far too seriously by too many of my fellow Christians) - came across as more of a deliberate attempt to call religion itself and especially the Catholic Church into question, this takes a much broader approach to the question of religion. It makes sure that some of the evils of religion are portrayed, but at the same time it's made clear that these are the evils of men rather than evils by which to judge either God or faith.The basis of the story is the so-called 'God particle,' and deals with the attempts of scientists to recreate the moment of creation. Having succeeded in that, what results is a particle of immense destructive power which is somehow seized by the 'Illuminati' - a somewhat shady historical society which in this movie is portrayed as a quasi-terrorist organization acting against the Roman Catholic Church - and is used as a threat to blow up the Vatican during a conclave to select a new pope. This becomes a sort of Vatican cloak and dagger movie. Four cardinals are kidnapped by this group, who leave clues as to what will happen, and we discover early on that there's a limited amount of time before the bomb blows up, so in some ways this becomes a stereotypical (but well done) countdown movie, where you're pretty sure everything will work out in the end, but you're not sure how you'll get there. To unravel the puzzle, the Vatican (somewhat unconvincingly, given his history) calls upon the 'religious symbologist' Robert Langdon (again played by Tom Hanks.) You can't really be sure who's on what side until the very end of the movie, and some of the twists that take place as the movie nears its end took me completely by surprise. I thought I had the whole thing figured out with an hour to go, but I didn't, so that was quite effective.Things perhaps got a wee bit silly from the point of the parachuting priest onward, but it was decent fun, and I did appreciate the irony of Langdon becoming the one whom Cardinal Strauss concedes (over Langdon's objections) was called by God to save the church essentially from itself. I also liked Strauss's line 'religion is flawed because man is flawed,' which seems to sum things up quite nicely. Overall, I liked this more than 'The Da Vinci Code,' perhaps because, minus the controversy of the earlier novel/movie, I could appreciate this more on its own merits.",7,0,1,12 April 2010
Black Swan," How Could You Hope For Anything More In A Movie
","This is one of the few films I've personally ever come across that from moment one begins - unobtrusively and almost imperceptibly - to draw the viewer in, and then suddenly - before you know it - you're absolutely hooked and unable to let go even if - after the first few minutes - this looked as if it was shaping up to be a good but ultimately forgettable film. In the end, though, director Darren Aronofsky shapes and builds this movie almost perfectly and leaves you with few if any unrealized expectations.In the beginning this all seems so simple. Nina (played brilliantly by Natalie Portman) is a young, shy, nervous, beautiful and technically proficient ballerina who seeks the lead role in a modern production of 'Swan Lake.' The director Thomas (Vincent Cassel) recognizes that her style is perfect for the portrayal of the white swan but that she lacks the necessary 'edge' to play the black swan. He gives her the role and begins to work with her to get her to explore a riskier, less technically proficient but more passionate side of dancing. At this point it looks like a fairly well-worn type of story, as the movie seems to be shaping up as little more than a study of the rivalries that exist between dancers in a ballet company (which you expect to be taken to an extreme) - and, indeed, rivalries within the company abound - from the dancer that Nina replaced (a somewhat limited role played by Winona Ryder) to one of her fellow ballerinas (Lily, played by Mila Kunis, who brought exactly the right look and feel to the character) who wanted the role and didn't get it, ending up as Nina's alternate. From beginning to end, in the background there's a study of the obviously unhealthy relationship between Nina and her mother (Barbara Hershey) - apparently a former ballerina herself who now wants to live her dream through Nina, who comes across as over- protective and controlling. The characters all have depth, and yet the movie never seems to get bogged down in an intractable character study. We learn about these people as the movie flows effortlessly, portraying Nina's development as a ballerina and her descent as she seems to lose touch with reality, so obsessed does she become with being the black swan.The development of this movie is deliberate but spellbinding, and it never lacks a beat; never leaves you wondering if watching this is worth it. It's both subtle and in your face at the same time. It's sensual and even erotic at times - and yet there's a sense of innocence (especially from Nina) and the sensuality and eroticism are portrayed with (as far as I can recall) not even a single scene of nudity. It's violent at times and yet there's nothing here that's especially graphic. The characters all have you wondering about them. Thomas, Lily and Nina's mother all seem off balance somehow. The controlling mother; Lily who's obsessed with wanting the role and jealous that Nina got it instead; Thomas who comes across as little more than a lecherous director looking for 'favours' from the dancers, quite frankly. And then in the end it all gets turned around. Were any of these people really what they appeared to be, or did much of this happen in Nina's mind as she became more and more obsessed about her role? That, in the end, is the psychological power of this movie - trying to distinguish the fine line between what's real and what's imagined. Once the movie hits full stride it's hard to make that distinction. The last half hour or so, dealing with the opening night of the ballet and Nina's actual debut performance in the role, is especially gripping.Who'd have thought? I'm not interested in ballet. I've never seen a performance of any ballet - let alone 'Swan Lake.' And yet this movie gives one an appreciation of ballet as an art form and almost convinces me to go and see one. In addition to that, it turns out to be a tense and emotional psychological thriller that leaves not a single bit of disappointment. It is absolutely worthy of the Oscar nominations it's received, and I for one will be especially rooting for Natalie Portman on Oscar night 2011.",10,5,11,29 January 2011
Changeling," A Wonderfully Told Story About A Horrible Mystery
","When it's over, 'Changeling' is one of those movies that leaves you somewhat emotionally drained. I have a very mixed reaction to Clint Eastwood's work both as an actor and as a director - some I love, some is OK, some I really don't care for. There's no consistency. This film, though, is a definite winner, and he's clearly on a winning streak after his great work with 'Gran Torino.' Set in 1920's Los Angeles and depicting real events, the movie begins a bit slowly, with a depiction of a series of domestic scenes to establish the relationship between single mother Christine Collins and her only son Walter, but once the element of mystery is introduced, Eastwood very skilfully builds the suspense through a series of mysteries. After leaving Walter alone at home when she's called into work, Christine returns home to an empty house, with no clue about what's happened to Walter. At first, the mystery appears to be simply 'what happened to Walter?' But it keeps growing. Months later, the police 'reunite' Christine with her son - except she's convinced that it isn't her son. Who is this boy? Then a story about police corruption becomes the focus, leading to the police illegally sending Christine off to a psychiatric hospital because she refuses to accept the boy as her son. Along the way, she connects with what you might call an 'avenging angel' - a well-known Presbyterian minister with a popular radio ministry who's taken it as his mission to fight police corruption. Finally, the movie becomes extremely dark and disturbing, as it begins to look at a series of child abductions and murders, of which Walter may or may not be a victim.In the end, there's no resolution - there can't be, because in truth Walter's remains weren't identified, nor was he ever found. What happened to him remains a mystery to this day. Subsequent to watching this I was involved enough with the story to do some checking on the 'Wineville Chicken Coop Murders' as they're known in history. The story is remarkably accurate. There are a few details about Christine's experiences which are altered for dramatic licence I suppose, but nothing really substantive, and some details about the killer Gordon Northcott are left out, but again they weren't important to this particular story, since it was about Christine and Walter and not the killer or the murders per se.Perhaps strangely for a movie that I considered to be a very good one, I can't say that the performances leaped out at me. They were fine; there was nothing wrong with them. It's just that the story itself was so compelling and so well told that the cast seemed secondary. I was actually surprised to check the cast list later and discover that Christine was played by Angelina Jolie. That's a compliment to Jolie, by the way, because she became so totally Christine that I didn't see her as anyone else. This is truly a movie that deserves to be seen. 9/10",9,3,4,2 November 2009
Men in Black 3," The Men In Black 10 Years Later. Or 40 Years Earlier. Or Something.
","I didn't like Men In Black II. I thought it was entirely dull and unoriginal, so I can't honestly say that I had high expectations for the third instalment of the series. But I have to give credit to director Barry Sonnenfeld, who put together a worthy sequel to the memorable original - much better than II, which I would forget, if I only had a neuralizer!One thing that gave this a fresh feel was introducing time travel. Yes, time travel has been done a lot in movies - and maybe overdone. But it was nevertheless done pretty well in this. In the story, an alien criminal named Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from a prison on the moon to seek his revenge against the human who captured him - our old friend Agent K (again played by Tommy Lee Jones.) His revenge involves going back in time, killing K and setting in motion a series of events that leads to a massive alien invasion of earth. To prevent all of that from happening, Agent J (Will Smith) takes himself back in time, where he encounters a younger Boris and a younger Agent K and becomes involved with trying to plant a defence net that will prevent any future alien invasions on the Apollo spacecraft about to blast off for the moon in July of 1969.The story was decent, and had its share of humorous moments, very much in the MIB tradition. I thought perhaps a little more could have been done with J trying to fit into 1969. What really made this movie work, in my opinion, was Josh Brolin's performance as the young K. He was almost a dead ringer for what you would have expected K to look like 40 years ago. He captured the role perfectly.The movie goes for a little bit of a sentimental ending as J relives his very first meeting with K (a meeting which is totally unexpected) and then everyone moves back to the present.This is a worthy sequel to the first Men In Black - maybe not enough to put the memory of Men In Black II out of your minds, but it does leave a better taste.",6,0,1,29 June 2013
The New World," Beautifully Filmed, But Quite Lacking In Story
","I can completely understand those people who speak of how beautifully photographed and filmed this movie was. It truly was. Director Terence Malick deserves credit for that. The sceneries were lovely, and the re- creation of early 17th century Jamestown had a feel of authenticity to it that's often lacking in movies such as this. If that's all you were to rate a movie on then this movie would have to be rated spectacularly. But there's more to a movie than the photography and scenery. There's story and pacing. On that count, I can also completely understand those people who speak of how poorly paced this movie was and how dull it was in many ways. I fall on the side of the latter group in this debate. As beautifully filmed as this was, the story failed to hold me. At 2:15, this movie isn't outrageously long compared to some, but it seemed to be. The movie appropriately documents the early development of Jamestown as happening within the context of a clash between English and native American culture. That would have been more powerful if it hadn't then chosen to buy into the myth of the Pocahantas-John Smith romance, around which the movie largely revolved. The broad brush strokes of Pocahantas' life are accurate - from her upbringing with her native tribe in America to her later life in England with John Rolfe - but Smith isn't accurately depicted, and the romance between the two, from what I know, is fiction.Colin Farrell as Smith was surprisingly low-key (considering that he's - well - Colin Farrell!) but he was OK in the role, and newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher was about the same as Pocahantas. The movie - with its slow- moving and largely unfocused story - rises or falls on how well you can appreciate a movie based almost solely on its artistic merits. For me, I needed more of a coherent story to keep me involved. (2/10)",2,1,2,1 August 2011
Frost_Nixon," It Reminded Me Of A Heavyweight Boxing Match
","In a way this reminded me of a significant heavyweight boxing match. It's not full of excitement. In fact a good 75% of the movie is basically David Frost and Richard Nixon 'feeling each other out' and searching for weaknesses in each other. Frost, of course (played by Michael Sheen) is the British journalist who scored a coup by being granted a series of interviews with former US President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) and it truly did remind me of boxing. Nixon was the champ (even though he had resigned) and Frost wanted to beat him. Frost had to call him out; negotiate a chance to take him on (and a price for doing so). Then came the first few interviews, dealing with Nixon's personal life, Vietnam, etc. They danced around each other and developed a certain comfort level with the battle they knew was coming: the interview dealing with Watergate, and whether Frost would get Nixon to confess to any wrongdoing. To that point, the movie truly wasn't especially exciting. It provided a bit of background into the mindsets of the two protagonists: Frost desperately wanting to be taken seriously as a journalist in the US, Nixon seeking to vindicate himself after feeling unfairly pushed out of office. Aside from the background, though, it wasn't overly interesting and the 'talking heads' interviews were hard to take seriously. 'Talking heads' interviews work best (and I really don't like them at the best of times) when you're at least listening to the real 'talking heads.' Listening to Oliver Platt or Kevin Bacon pretending to be people who are 'talking heads' meant that it was hard to take what they said seriously, even if it was accurate. The whole thing did finally lead up to that last showdown, though, which was quite well done. To go back to the boxing metaphor, these guys had been testing each other for maybe 10 rounds, and it was now coming down to the end - it was time to start swinging and to see who would come out on top. That last interview was dramatic and Langella I thought handled Nixon's persona well.No - it's not exciting. Nor is it especially historically enlightening. It goes over mostly well trod ground. It is interesting, though - mostly for those who are political junkies, or who have an interest in Watergate or US history. If you don't have those interests, you won't be interested in this. The very slow buildup drags this down somewhat, and in the end I'd say it was OK. It rates about a 5/10.",5,3,6,27 December 2009
Alien 3," Downward But Onward
","It happens so often. A really good movie is made, and then come the inevitable sequels that eventually start to leave a bad taste in your mouth about the entire series, no matter how good the original was. Alien 3 is the second sequel in the series. The original 'Alien' (directed by Ridley Scott) was quite good, tense and suspenseful. I didn't think James Cameron did a good job at all with 'Aliens,' and here David Fincher has failed with 'Alien 3.'There are times when this is mildly tense, but generally speaking I was bored for most of its run time. Part of the problem here is the setting - the movie is set on some sort of prison planet, where Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) crashlands after the events of 'Aliens.' She's the only survivor, and she wakes up in a medical unit, surrounded by a motley (to say the least) crew of thugs thieves and rapists and child molesters (as they describe themselves.) What this means is that, automatically, aside from Ripley there's nobody here to care about. Seriously - who cares about these guys for even a moment? The alien creature is, of course, back and wreaks havoc among the inmates. The alien has morphed yet again. In the first movie we saw little of the creature. In the second, it was more front and centre. This time we get a really good look at it, and to me it came across as a bit of a cross between a giant octopus and a raptor such as you'd see in 'Jurassic Park.' There's no particular reason to be frightened by it - we know what it's going to do. Fincher goes for a lot of blood in this - but blood isn't scary. It's even pretty easy to figure out how this is going to end. It's hardly worth the effort involved in watching.I rated 'Aliens' as a 3/10. I'll give this the same.

Gremlins," With Mogwai Comes Great Responsibility
","This certainly isn't your typical Christmas movie. Obviously it's nowhere near as dark as 'Black Christmas,' but it sure ain't 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' either. It's horror, it's comedy, it's Christmas, it's even philosophical at times. 'Gizmo' is a mogwai - a cute and intelligent little pet of sorts, found by inventor Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) in a basement shop run by a little old Chinese man (Keye Luke). Randall buys (well, acquires really) Gizmo as a Christmas gift for his son Billy (Zach Galligan.) But there are rules that go along with having a mogwai: don't expose them to bright light, don't give them water, and don't ever feed them after midnight. Well, poor Gizmo gets water spilled on him, and the chaos begins. Water causes Gizmo to reproduce in some way, and Gizmo's offspring aren't the cute little creatures Gizmo is. They start out as more or less mischievous, then become destructive and ultimately violent. They pretty much take over the little town of Kingston Falls on Christmas Eve, wreaking havoc everywhere.It's hard to figure out who the intended audience is for this. It's too dark to be a kids movie, but the basic story isn't mature enough to be looked at as an adult comedy. And yet - in a strange sort of way - it works. It's a fun movie, with a great musical score and even as the town is wrecked and even as people die you find yourself laughing about it. How can you not laugh when Mrs. Deagle (Polly Holliday) goes flying out the upper floor window of her house!It pays tribute to a few other movies. There's a touch of 'It's A Wonderful Life' here, and Mrs. Deagle was clearly patterned after Miss Gulch (aka the Wicked Witch of the West) from 'The Wizard Of Oz.' And in the midst of the laughs, the mayhem and the violence there's a philosophical basis to this: we should try to avoid messing with things we don't understand. Randall was told that he couldn't have the mogwai. But the Chinese man's grandson manages to secretly sell him to Randall anyway, apparently not really understanding the potential consequences, and Randall and Billy are clearly unprepared for dealing with this cute little creature.I thought the performances in this were average. Nobody was outstanding, but the story was certainly a creative fantasy, and watching this 30 years later I was struck by some of Randall's inventions. He invented a sort of Keurig machine. He invented a sort of cordless phone. He invented a sort of smokeless ash tray. None of them worked very well - but they all came to pass! Give writer Chris Columbus some points for predicting some of the future. (6/10)",6,0,0,20 December 2015
The Monuments Men," I Was Expecting Better
","'The Monuments Men' has a very solid cast. You see George Clooney, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, John Goodman and Bill Murray and you're expecting something special. And the story seemed as if it should lend itself to something special. It's based on the true story of an Allied team put together during World War II whose mission is to locate and recover art treasures stolen by the Nazis. It was a significant mission - to save the cultural heritage of Europe. Between the cast and the story you expect something better. By the time it's over, you find yourself thinking that you were expecting something better. In the end, 'The Monuments Men' disappoints.Clooney was Stokes, who convinced President Roosevelt to form the team, and Damon is Granger, who in many ways the movie revolves around. Both were fine. But, in the end, the movie just wasn't very interesting. It sputtered along. At times there were attempts at humour, and there were even sombre moments with reflections on the Holocaust scattered throughout. The most powerful scene for me revolved not around the discovery of stolen art, but rather of a barrel full of gold fillings. There's also a portrayal of early American-Soviet rivalry. Both want to find the art, but both have different plans for it. The Americans want to return it to its rightful owners, while the Soviets plan to keep it.There was enough material to work with to have made a pretty good and exciting movie. But somehow, 'The Monuments Men' missed the mark, and turned out to be disappointing more than anything. (5/10)",5,1,1,31 May 2014
Miracle," This Might Be The Best Hockey Movie Ever Made
","There really haven't been a lot of hockey movies made over the years. I can think immediately of 'Slap Shot' - which was a comedy and not a serious hockey movie. There was 'The Mighty Ducks' - but that was more of a kids movie than anything. And I can remember that the story of the US gold medal win in the 1980 Winter Olympics (the same story told in this movie) was told in 1982's TV movie 'Miracle On Ice.' There may have been others, but I can't think of them. But however many there may have been I find it hard to believe that they would have been better than this version of the story.It's a hockey movie. From beginning to end it's a hockey movie. On and off the ice, in the dressing room and the board room and in Herb Brooks' home - it's a hockey movie. But it does a truly superb job of blending in what was going on in the world at the time - which is really what made the whole story so dramatic in the first place. The 1970's had been a bad decade for the United States. Watergate and Vietnam and the Arab oil embargo and a sputtering economy. As the decade closed the US Embassy in Iran was seized and American diplomats there were taken hostage and the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. The Soviet Union seemed to be in the ascendance, and the United States seemed to be in a downward spiral. Who would have thought that hockey - which was really not much more than a niche sport in the US at the time - would be the start of an American resurgence?This movie focuses on Herb Brooks - who was the coach of that US Olympic team. Kurt Russell played the part, and played it well. Brooks had a passion for hockey and for the job of coaching this team. It was a passion that became an obsession, fuelled by the fact that in 1960 (when the US had also won a surprise Olympic hockey gold medal) he had been the last player cut from that team before the Games began. Brooks took on the job and demanded complete control over the program. He drove the players - hard; almost to the breaking point at times. He was their coach and not their friend; he wasn't looking to win popularity contests. It was a fascinating portrayal of the man, who tragically died not long before this film was released. Brooks was the focal point of what was happening. The players, on the other hand, were a team. In the movie, that means that Russell dominates. The actors who played the players kind of fade into the background. Patricia Clarkson does a decent job as Brooks' wife Patti - who sometimes resents her husband's obsession with the job and team and game - and Noah Emmerich is decent enough as assistant coach Craig Patrick - who's often uncomfortable with Brooks' coaching methods - but this is Kurt Russell's movie, and the 1980 US Olympic hockey team was Herb Brooks' team, and Russell pulls it off well.The on-ice action is brilliantly staged and seems absolutely authentic. Even though we know the outcome, the movie did a great job of building up the suspense of that US-Soviet game, as a bunch of American college players take on the mighty and experienced Soviet hockey machine, which was professional in all but name, which had taken 2 of 3 games against a team of NHL All-Stars (blasting the NHL'ers 6-0 in the final game) in a tournament held a few months before the Olympics, and which should have crushed the US team. Like most anything that chronicles the tournament, the movie tends to skip quickly over the fact that the US still had to beat Finland after beating the Soviet Union to win the gold medal. With everything happening in the world at the time, of course, what really mattered was that the United States beat the Soviet Union. There will never be another hockey game like that 1980 game. It's probably matched in drama only by Game 8 of the 'Canada-Russia' series of 1972. Hockey is such an international sport now, the best players are all familiar to us because most of them (wherever they're from) play in the NHL, and the top countries are all capable of beating each other on any given night, so this type of upset and drama could probably never be reproduced. I'm not an American, so the patriotic aspect of this film eluded me, but I am (like all good Canadians) a hockey fan - and I have to say that Disney put out one fine hockey movie with 'Miracle.'

Captain Phillips," Another First Rate Performance From Tom Hanks
","Once this gets going, it keeps you glued to your seat. 'Captain Phillips' is based on the story of the Mearsk Alabama, which really was captured by pirates off the coast of Somalia in 2009. As the title suggests, the movie (based actually on a book written afterward by Phillips) focuses on what happened to Phillips after he was taken hostage and held for ransom, which negotiations being conducted by the U.S. Navy.After a brief introduction, which serves primarily to introduce us to Phillips as a family man, most of the movie is set either on the Maersk Alabama, or in the lifeboat the pirates use to escape and in which they take Phillips. Perhaps it's merely because we know what's going to happen, but even as the scenes aboard the ship start out slowly and calmly, with Phillips merely taking command, there is a sense of tension. There are warnings of piracy activities in the region, and as the Maersk Alabama begins to track the pirates on radar, that tension builds, leading up to the takeover and hostage taking.The experiences of Phillips on the lifeboat are harrowing. Hanks does a superb job with the character - his most powerful scenes coming at the end, as he's released back into U.S. custody and gets taken to the warship's sick bay and begins to break down as he's examined by a doctor. Those scenes are rife with emotion. It's impossible not to be drawn into the character at that moment and to begin to wonder just what the experience would have been like. It really was a brilliant performance by Hanks, who built the character slowly but surely over the course of the movie, leading to that final scene.Some of the Maersk Alabama's crew members have challenged the accuracy of the film. Some have suggested that Phillips was not as much of a hero as the film suggests and that he was, in fact, to some extent to blame for what happened by not listening to warnings to stay 600 km off the coast of Somalia (the Maersk Alabama was only a little over 200 km off the Somali coast when this happened.) I can't vouch for the history, of course, except to note that it's obviously filmed from Phillips' perspective, being based on Phillips' book about the incident. As a movie though, this is in fact quite gripping, and it's one of Hanks finest performances. The movie even manages to take a fairly even-handed approach to the pirates, not portraying them as evil but rather more as desperate people living in a desperate part of the world.

10 Cloverfield Lane," A Good Suspense-Thriller Weakened By An Unnecessary Sci-Fi Turn At The End
","For the most part, '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a very good thriller, very suspenseful and certainly manages to keep the viewers on the edge of their seat. From the start you're not entirely sure what's happening, and the scenes in the bunker are almost surreal in the way they move from menacing to sheer domestic. The atmosphere in the bunker was superb, and fit the genre of the movie perfectly, and director Dan Trachtenberg used it well. The highlight of the movie for me was John Goodman. I confess that I'm not really a big fan of Goodman, but I'd be prepared to say that this may have been the best performance I've seen him give. As Howard, he can be both scary and charming, and there's mystery about him. From the very start you don't really know if he's a good guy or a bad guy; if he's telling the truth or lying through his teeth. The movie begins with a car accident. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is leaving her boyfriend and gets into a bad accident. When she awakens she's chained to the wall in a room, apparently a prisoner of Howard. But is she a prisoner? Howard tells her that there's been some type of attack (nuclear or chemical) and that he found her and brought her into the bunker to save her life, because the air outside is unbreathable. Is that true? We wonder for a while, but there seems to be enough supporting his story to make us believe him. There's a second prisoner or guest - Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.) about whom we learn very little. How did he get there? We're not sure. Howard, Emmett and Michelle seem to settle in for the long haul, convinced that they can't get out. Howard is a bit unbalanced, and you get the impression that you can never really be sure how he's going to react to things. He clearly was a prepper - believing that something like this was going to happen, and maybe a little bit shocked that it actually did. Emmett and Michelle wonder about escaping - but escaping to where? Is there anything left outside the bunker? Could they survive if they left?It's very suspenseful, and then as far as I was concerned it was ruined by the ending, which turned into some sort of alien/sci-fi sort of film. I knew that as always a possibility, but I was hoping that the movie would take a different direction. It was working quite well for me just as the mystery of Howard and the bunker, which the confined atmosphere creating more than enough suspense. I didn't really need aliens. Somehow, for me, that took away from what had been making the movie work so well.Supposedly this is described as a 'spiritual successor' to the 2008 film 'Cloverfield.' Maybe - but you don't need to have seen 'Cloverfield' for this to make sense. I wouldn't call it a sequel in the normal use of the term and I can't really say that anything in this really made me think about 'Cloverfield.' It's capable of standing on its own. It's a taut little suspense/thriller with an ending that could have been better.",6,0,0,17 January 2017
The Finest Hours," I Spent Most Of Two Hours Wondering What Had Gone Wrong With This
","This seemed to have a decent enough cast (Chris Pine and Ben Affleck, for example) and it certainly sounded like it would be an exciting story of a rescue at sea, as members of the US Coast Guard try to rescue the crew of an oil tanker adrift off the coast of Massachussetts during a winter storm. And - for what it's worth (which often isn't much) it has the advantage of being based on a true story (although one expects it to be 'disney-fied,' since the movie was made by Disney. Still, it seemed to have a lot going for it - and yet I ended up spending most of the movie's runtime wondering what had gone so terribly wrong.It really wasn't very interesting. It had one of the least engrossing opening I've ever come across. To be honest I dozed off at least three times in the first 30 minutes, which were just interminable. Maybe I'm just not the romantic type, but I really couldn't get myself revved about about the relationship between Bernie and Miriam. And, once we got to the actual rescue, it really didn't get much better. The special effects were OK, but somehow there was an aura of unreality hanging over this. It just didn't seem convincing. And at one point near the end of the movie - which had already gone on much too long - for whatever reason there was a decision made to show the waves crashing over the tanker and the rescue boat - in slow motion! Oy vey! That just made it longer.I wanted to like this. I really did. And I thought I would. But I didn't. I didn't like it at all. I just wondered what had gone wrong. I got totally lost in that muddle of an opening half hour, and nothing that came afterward appealed to me enough to get me interested again. (1/10)",1,2,6,8 December 2016
Ali," A Major Disappointment
","To give credit where credit is due I want to start off with mentioning the fine performances in this movie. Will Smith was quite convincing as Muhammad Ali. It must be difficult and somewhat intimidating to play a legend who is still alive, but he managed to get both the look and the voice down quite well. Stealing the show, however (and in a relatively limited role) was Jon Voight as Howard Cosell. Voight really WAS Cosell in this movie. Everything about him screamed Cosell. It was almost scary, in fact - a Cosell resurrection. (Which, come to think of it wouldn't be a bad thing. I really miss Howard.) Anyway, I've only seen bits and pieces of 'Monday Night Mayhem' and I'm not sure who played Cosell there, but Voight beat him mercilessly in the part, whoever he was. Watch 'Ali' just for Jon Voight!Unfortunately, I thought the story itself was weak and badly organized. There was no flow to it; no continuity. It was like a series of  vignettes of Ali's life (Ali fights Liston; Ali converts to Islam; Ali refuses induction; and so on and so forth) but without any strong sense of connection between them. And I guess the second problem is that it wasn't about Ali's life. The movie starts with Ali winning the title against Sonny Liston in 1964 and ends with him winning the title back against George Foreman in 1974. So it's 10 years of Ali's life, and this lack of historical context bothered me a bit. What were his younger years like? The plot outline here at IMBD says 'A biography of sports legend, Muhammad Ali, from his early days to his days in the ring.' Huh? What early days? It starts with his title fight against Liston! You wouldn't have a clue from watching this movie, for example, that Cassius Clay was a gold medalist from the 1960 Rome Olympics. It was never mentioned. And what of his sadder later years? After winning the title back against Foreman he had a couple of good years and some good fights (notably the rematch with Joe Frazier) but it's not mentioned. And what an interesting study could have been done of a problem many athletes have giving up the limelight. I mean, from about 1976 on Ali was fading badly, won some questionable decisions based on his name rather than his performance in the ring, and fought a series of relative unknowns (anyone remember Alfredo Evangelista?) because he knew he couldn't beat the serious contenders (finally losing to Leon Spinks in 1978 - and yes winning the title back again in a rematch later that year.) Then, ill fated comeback attempts; the battle with Parkinson's. All left out, except for a brief note at the end of the movie that Ali lost and regained the title in 1978. I think a look at his earlier and especially his later years would have made this a far more compelling movie.As it is if one word could sum up my thought about this it would be 'disappointing.'3/10 (basically a credit to Smith and Voight. Without them it would have been lower.)",3,1,2,19 November 2002
Source Code," An Excellent And Exciting Movie That Did Leave Me A Bit Confused
","I really liked this movie. That's the first thing that needs to be said. The premise is interesting, the story is exciting and the characters are believable (in a sci-fi sort of way) and as a result likable. Jake Gyllenhaal put on an excellent performance in the leading role as Capt. Colter Stevens - a US Air Force pilot who, as the movie opens, mysteriously finds himself not in Afghanistan where he was posted but on a commuter train heading into Chicago - and in someone else's body and life. Gyllenhaal was superb in this role. He literally held the movie together. There were very few scenes in which he wasn't front and centre, so if his performance had been anything less than superb the whole movie would have suffered, but he made this work. We discover pretty soon that something bad is going to happen on this train, and as the story unfolds we learn that Stevens is being used in an experiment called 'Source Code' that allows him to experience the last few minutes of someone else's life. The authorities have discovered that there's a series of terrorist bombings planned in Chicago, and in an attempt to thwart them sends Stevens into the last 8 minutes of the life of someone who died on the train in the first of the explosions. Stevens' mission is to figure out who the bomber is, and to do that he keeps being sent back in after his 8 minutes are up to relive the whole time over and over again until he pieces enough together to reveal the bomber's identity.It's an interesting premise - and it's a good mystery. There was nothing especially that gave away the bomber's identity until it was revealed. It could have been anyone on the train, which is part of Stevens' challenge. Gyllenhaal was teamed with a pretty solid cast. I really liked Michelle Monaghan as Christine - the almost girlfriend of the guy whose life Stevens is thrown into. She did a great job in the part, confused by Stevens' confusion (because he knows nothing about the man's life) but obviously caring about him. Until the end, the temptation to get these two together as a couple was largely left alone, and when it did happen at the end, it was kind of a nice, feel-good ending to a troubling premise that I don't want to say too much about in a review. Vera Farmiga as the Air Force officer who's Stevens' basic contact with the outside world was solid as her character develops an increasing sympathy for Stevens' plight and Jeffrey Wright - while good - came across as a bit of a stereotypical scientist more concerned about his experiments than about how they'll affect others.I had a bit of confusion over some elements of the plot. I understand that Stevens was being sent to live the last 8 minutes of this person's life, based on the premise that a person's brain lives on for a few minutes after the body dies. OK, but I wondered how they would have been able to access this man's brain memory (for lack of any other way to describe it) since he surely would have been dead longer than that by the time they pulled him out of the wrecked train? I also wondered how Stevens, once in this man's brain memory could do anything other than what the man had done, or could know anything other than what the man knew. Wouldn't his experience be completely dependent on the deceased man's memory and experience? Confusing - to me at least. Otherwise, I thought this was an excellent and exciting movie.",9,0,1,5 December 2011
50 First Dates," Could Have Been A First Rate Romantic Comedy If It Had Been Taken Seriously
","To be perfectly honest, I feel almost guilty giving this movie only 5/10. It has a lot of potential as a romantic comedy and there's a lot of fun in it, but for all the good points about this movie, it has a lot of weak points as well, that can be summed up as follows: Adam Sandler! I shouldn't be too hard on Sandler, I guess. I mean, he didn't produce this, or direct this, or write this. But he did star in it. From a strictly personal perspective, I simply don't care for Sandler; never have and never will. And even though I can't hold Sandler responsible for how this movie is put together, how it's put together and the fact that it fits Sandler to a 'T' just reinforces to me what the problem with him is. It seems to me that he wants to be taken as a serious actor (the movies I've seen him in always seem to have something of a 'serious' subplot to them) but I wonder if he just doesn't have the confidence to think he can pull it off, and so ends up falling back on the more juvenile plot lines that his movies will be largely remembered for.This could have been a truly first-rate romantic comedy. The plot is probably nonsense from a medical point of view, but from a comedic point of view it's OK. Lucy (Drew Barrymore) suffers a brain injury in an accident and suffers short-term memory loss, which means that she remembers nothing since the accident, and she wakes up every day thinking it's October 13. (Sort of like 'Groundhog Day,' except that Bill Murray's character knew he was repeating the same day over and over again.) Everyone around her protects her from reality by going along with what she remembers. Then, one day, Henry Roth (Sandler) enters the diner where Lucy is having breakfast, and they fall head over heels. The next day he's back, and so's she - but she doesn't remember a thing about him. The movie then proceeds with the premise that the love-stricken Roth has to convince Lucy to fall in love every day with a man who to her is a complete stranger in order to keep the relationship going. And that basic premise is good, and it works very well, and to give credit where credit is due Sandler plays the part well, when he's taking it seriously. But therein lies the problem. This is an Adam Sandler movie, and it has to fall into typical Sandler-style juvenile thinking, which is displayed largely around a couple of characters.Why does Lucy's brother Doug (Sean Astin) have to be a lisping steroid-abuser? It would been far more effective had he been just another serious, caring and compassionate person in Lucy's life trying to protect her, and the character of Ten Second Tom (Allan Covert) is meaningless. Setting them aside, though, my real pet peeve then appears: the character Ula (Rob Schneider.) Ula grates on the viewer and is totally unnecessary to the movie's development, and serves no purpose whatsoever - absolutely none - except to get Rob Schneider a paycheck. As to Sandler's Henry Roth, I have no problem with him being a veterinarian, even a vet who specializes in walruses (someone has to, I guess) but the trained walruses in the movie kind of give this a sense of being an adult-oriented kiddie movie.What a shame. It's really a good idea for a movie, and if its producers, writers, director, etc. had chosen to treat it as a more serious romantic comedy, it could have reached great heights. Drew Barrymore was superb as Lucy, alternatively being in love with Henry and then hating him (depending on the day) and portrays brilliantly Lucy's fear and shock at discovering the reality of her existence. Dan Aykroyd's talents were largely and unfortunately wasted as Lucy's neurologist, Dr. Keats. Lesser known Blake Clark was convincing as Lucy's protective (and over-protective) dad, and Sandler himself did very well when he was treating this as a serious movie for grown-ups. But the whole typical Sandler-Schneider thing just got to me and I can't give it any better than a 5.",5,3,6,6 March 2006
The Young Victoria," A Good Period Piece Depicting Queen Victoria's Early Life
","This is first of all a beautiful period piece, with exquisitely designed sets and costumes. Set in the period just before and in the early years of Victoria's reign as Queen of England, there is a definite sense of authenticity that flows throughout this movie. The story itself revolves essentially around two aspects of Victoria's early life. The first deals with the troubled relationships that existed within the royal family. Victoria's uncle was King William IV - a man who only became King at the age of 64 and had a touch of eccentricity about him. Since William was childless, the heir to the throne was his niece Victoria. Victoria's mother and her partner Sir John Conroy (who many believe was her lover) conspired to take control of England themselves by convincing Victoria to establish a regency. William, however, survived until Victoria's 18th birthday, and Victoria - hostile to Conroy and unsympathetic to her mother - refused to consider a regency, instead reigning in her own right. This was an interesting view of royal life and of some of the intrigues taking place behind the scenes, as well as a somewhat rare depiction of William IV, who's largely forgotten today. The second part of the story dealt with the growing relationship and eventual romance between Victoria and her cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe, Coburg and Gotha. This took up the bulk of the movie, although I would say personally that I found the political machinations within and without the royal family more interesting. It was, however, a good (and corrective) look at a side of Victoria rarely reflected upon. The image we have of her tends to be of her later life - after Albert's death, when she went into extended mourning. Her name sums up an era (the Victorian) widely seen as passionless and, frankly, somewhat dull. Thus, it's refreshing to see Victoria shown as passionately in love with Albert (which she was in truth.)Emily Blunt's performance as Victoria was top-notch, with Rupert Friend offering a very good performance as Albert. Friend was appropriately in Blunt's shadow for most of the movie, just as Albert would have been in Victoria's. This is an interesting take on Victoria's early life. It's not especially exciting, and adds nothing really that anyone with knowledge of the outline of Victoria's life wouldn't know already (which, of course, also means that it isn't hopelessly romanticized, although the scene in which Albert takes a bullet for Victoria is complete myth, as was the idea that was mentioned that Victoria's marriage made her more popular, when in fact her marriage to Albert was not popular at first with the public) but it's still a good watch.",7,2,2,19 August 2010
Catch Me If You Can," Good Fun; DiCaprio's Best Since 'Titanic'
","This movie earns a good rating if only for bringing to light the unbelievable and yet true story of Frank Abagnale (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a young scam artist who bilked banks out of millions and who, having been captured and come clean, eventually put his talents to work in the other direction. If you can get through what I thought was an agonizingly boring animated sequence that runs during the opening credits (which seemed to go on forever) you'll enjoy this.The movie is about Abagnale's criminal days, and takes the viewer on a roller coaster of situations which Abagnale manages to lie, swindle and cheat his way through, all the time being pursued by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks); thus the title of the movie. It's a fun story (particularly, I thought, his very first 'scam' - as a student at a new school, he manages to convince people that he's a substitute French teacher and actually 'works' in that capacity for 10 days until he's discovered!)In my opinion, this is DiCaprio's best performance since 'Titanic.' I haven't been impressed with his work since, but here he really managed to become the character of Abagnale (much as he did with Dawson in 'Titanic') rather than simply looking as though he were acting a part. He was clearly the star of the movie. Tom Hanks, on the other hand, quite surprisingly disappointed me a bit, and I would rarely say that about such a talented actor. Perhaps it was the part of Hanratty, but Hanks just didn't stand out to me. It seemed as though a hundred actors could have played the role without anything (except the name Tom Hanks) being lost. So, my normal expectations of the two stars were reversed here, which made the movie all the more interesting.It's an enjoyable way to spend an evening.7/10",7,1,3,19 July 2003
The Hangover," Some Funny Scenes In An Overall Typical Dumb Comedy
","This movie is certainly aptly titled. Essentially it tells the story of four buddies who head out to Las Vegas for a couple of days for a bachelor party (because one of them is about to get married) and then have to spend the second day figuring out what they did on the first day because they got so totally wasted that they can't remember. One of them (the groom) has disappeared, one got married to a stripper, one ended up in the hospital and one found a tiger in their hotel bathroom! It was quite a weekend!There's no doubt that it is funny at times. The scene where 'Mr. Chow' jumps totally naked out of the trunk of their car had me in stitches. Having said that, it was also rather crude much of the time and sometimes came across as very much similar to a sophomoric-type comedy, which I don't think it's intended to be. It seems more inclined to be going for a more mature audience, but for me at least too many of the characters and situations just came across as ridiculously implausible rather than funny. The first twenty minutes or so I found especially difficult to get through, as it takes that long for anything even remotely funny to begin to happen, and the same can be said for the last few scenes, although I did appreciate the moment when Stu (the guy who married the stripper) finally kicked his obsessively controlling girlfriend out of his life. It's not a disastrous movie, and - yes - it is quite funny at times. Just not enough of the time. 4/10",4,1,2,4 January 2010
Marie Antoinette," 'This Is Ridiculous!' - 'This, Madam, Is Versailles!'
","I want to say, first, that I'm impressed that this movie is based on a book by Antonia Fraser. Antonia Fraser is a royal historian of great note, so if - and I realize that, as with any movie, that's a very big 'IF' - the movie really follows Fraser's work (which I unfortunately haven't read) then we're probably getting a fairly reasonable depiction of Marie Antoinette, and my impression is that, indeed, this is a reasonable taste of her life, up to the point at which Marie and King Louis are removed from Versailles and taken to Paris. The movie ends with their departure from Versailles; there's nothing of Louis' attempt to hold on to the throne by agreeing to become a constitutional monarch, the royal attempt at escape, or their trial and execution.I rather liked the take on Marie Antoinette that was offered. Kirsten Dunst did very well with the role - she even looks a bit like Marie Antoinette. I really liked her in the role, and I thought she captured Marie's basic identity. I've always thought of Marie Antoinette as a bit of a tragic figure - not callous and uncaring as she's often portrayed (largely because of the belief that, when confronted by the fact that the people were starving because they had no bread, she replied 'Qu'ils mangent de la brioche' - 'let them eat cake' - which there's no solid evidence of her ever having done) but rather simply oblivious to what was happening outside court simply as a result of her pampered upbringing, which wasn't her fault - it was just the reality of her birth and her life. Yes, she was spoiled and pampered and largely cut off from reality by living at court, but I don't think that made her uncaring about what the people were going through - I think it made her oblivious to it because it was so far out of her reality. The movie and Dunst captured that.The sets and costuming in this were quite well done, and in general the cast was solid. I admit that I was a bit taken aback when I saw that Rip Torn was in this (he plays King Louis XV, Marie's father in law.) Maybe - as Marie was oblivious to the plight of her people - I've been oblivious to what's happening with Rip, because I didn't even know he was still around. But - like everyone else - he was fine. Sophia Coppola directed this and did well with it for the most part. It's certainly not the fastest paced movie you'll ever see, but Coppola managed to keep me interested and she made a brilliant decision by contrasting two scenes at the Paris Opera House that portrayed the rising opposition to Marie among the French people. In the first, she attends the opera and begins to applaud when it's over, which the French royals weren't supposed to do. Taken aback at first, the audience eventually joins in with her applause enthusiastically. Later in the movie, the same scene happens - Marie in the Opera House applauding at the end of the opera - except that this time no one joins her. Instead, people stare at her with disapproval, perhaps even barely disguised contempt. Those two scenes captures the flow of the movie well.For all that I liked, the one thing that I didn't like - indeed, it irritated me throughout - was the decision to try to give this a modern feel by interspersing various modern elements (especially the repeated use of rock music as a musical score.) It didn't fit and it was little more than distracting for the most part. The movie (for me at least) made the sorry decision to open that way, which put me off right from the start. There's also a pair of high top converse shoes that appears briefly. Supposedly, Coppola used these devices to remind us of the youth of the main character. I just found it unnecessary and out of place. I did - unlike some - like the ending of the movie. It simply depicts Louis and Marie being driven away from Versailles. I didn't need the rest of the history that I mentioned above. The movie was already long enough, and in any event it was about why Marie was so out of touch with the reality of life in 18th century France. It succeeded in that, even if it was a bit slow moving at times, and even with that irritating and out of place music. (6/10)",6,0,0,17 November 2012
The Ring," It Did Absolutely Nothing For Me - Except Put Me To Sleep
","From the high ratings and good reviews this movie gets, I approached it with very high expectations, which ultimately led to a major disappointment. The movie was spoiled from the start by a story that made no sense whatsoever (incoherent is a word that comes to mind to try to describe the plot), was then further burdened by weak acting galore and then ruins the only hope for its redemption by not even being bad enough to be funny - it ended up just plain bad (and not in the least bit scary.) Out of a mountain of problems, let me highlight just one: where in the world did the video come from? The story (such as it is) revolves around the concept that anyone who watches this video dies exactly seven days later. But the origin of the video is never satisfactorily explained. Yes, it has something to do with Samara (the deceased girl whose evil powers are still being used from her grave) - but how? And since the video is the centrepiece of the movie, I found that a major stumbling block that I couldn't get over. The truth is, this movie put me to sleep for about 40 minutes in the middle. When I could make no sense of the ending after waking up, I assumed it was because of the 40 minutes I had missed; so I went back and watched those 40 minutes. Clearly I was a glutton for punishment. It still made no sense. It was a total waste of 2 hours. 1/10",1,2,6,6 June 2009
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Preposterous Fun
","To state the obvious strengths of the movie right off the top: it's a good action-adventure movie, light-hearted even when managing to deal with sinister Nazis, with a fun lead character. Those things in and of themselves score this movie a few points, and one has to give credit for the fact that it really did set the pattern for the modern genre of action-adventure movies. It also established Harrison Ford (who was primarily known for his supporting role as Han Solo from 'Star Wars' at the time this was made) as an action-adventure leading man (he does these parts well; I find him perhaps a bit dry when he takes on more substantive roles) although it may not establish him as an 'actor' per se, since the part of Indiana Jones really isn't a dramatic part that would stretch or test an actor's ability. It required 'presence' rather than 'talent' and Ford brought that presence to the part very well. So, yes, there's a lot of good material here, and yet I can't say that I really enjoyed this, in spite of the obvious fun contained within it.The action-adventure elements are the key to this movie, and that being the case there's not enough, quite honestly. Between them, there are long stretches in which the story is told in a largely unconvincing and uninteresting manner - appropriate, I suppose, since the story itself is quite unconvincing. It might make for a good yarn, but someone still has to explain to me why Hitler would have been interested in finding the Jewish 'Ark of the Covenant.' I know it was explained at the outset that the Nazis wanted it because it contained great power and would make an army invincible, but one would have to believe the Jewish stories about it to believe that - and Hitler obviously didn't. Then as the movie reaches its climax, the power of the Ark is revealed in ridiculously supernatural terms. That aside, I found the romance between Indi and Marion (Karen Allen) uninteresting and largely unnecessary to the story, and the story itself to be such a wild ride that at times it just didn't seem to make sense to me.Maybe I'm taking this too seriously. It is fun on a regular basis - even if it is somewhat preposterous. But I still just didn't really enjoy it. 4/10",4,5,14,7 December 2009
Deepwater Horizon," A Good Depiction Of What Happened On The Rig
","When we think of the Deepwater Horizon incident I suspect that most people tend to think of the massive leak, that leaked literally hundreds of millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico over a period of several weeks before the leak was sealed. It was one of the most massive environmental disasters in American history. What doesn't stand out in my memory, though, is what happened on the oil rig itself. This movie tries to fill in that gap, and does so admirably.Much of it is told from the perspective of Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg), the chief electrician on the Deepwater Horizon. It opens by giving us a glimpse of his family life (enough to make this a very human and poignant story, but it's not overdone.) Once on the Horizon, we're introduced to various crew members, as well as a couple of executives from BP, who own the rig and the well. There's a lot of technical content, much of which went over my head, but I wonder if that might have been very deliberate. I may not have understood exactly what was happening, but I understood clearly enough that there was a problem building. The early tension comes from conflict between the crew (especially 'Mr. Jimmy' - the captain, played by Kurt Russell) who know something isn't right, and the BP execs (the most important played by John Malkovich) who push the crew to keep going because their primary concern is that the project is over budget and behind schedule. When money takes priority over safety the result usually won't be good. In this case it's not. The well explodes, the rig is caught up in a massive fire, and the crew is left in a desperate struggle to survive.Everything is very well portrayed and the cast does a very good job of drawing the viewer into the story and making you care. I've never been on an oil rig, but the set seemed authentic and gave the viewer the sense of being there. The buildup of tension is well done and once disaster strikes this becomes fast-paced and exciting. Peter Berg did a good job directing. Well done all around.",8,0,0,16 January 2017
United 93," A Fitting Tribute To The Passengers Of United 93
","I can remember sitting transfixed in front of the TV on September 11, 2001. It wasn't a morbid sort of fascination with the events of that day that was keeping me glued to the screen; it was more a sense of numbed paralysis and disbelief; a sort of 'how could this possibly be happening?' type of experience. I found myself (as did most people I suspect) with a lot of questions coming to my mind. Watching this movie (as I first did shortly after it was released) was a way of dealing with two of those questions: how would the passengers on those planes have felt as they approached what they must have eventually realized was their end, and, second, when the inevitable movies are made, are they going to be respectful or exploitative. This movie helped with both of those questions.This is - as the title says - essentially the story of United Airlines Flight 93, one of the hijacked planes on 9/11. I was pleased that the movie was made with the co-operation of the families of the passengers; pleased even that the DVD doesn't have previews of other movies, as so many do. There's no attempt to shill anything else here. The DVD just goes right into the story. It offers a powerful, emotional and completely respectful account of what might have happened on board that plane on that terrible day. United 93, of course, was the plane that didn't get to Washington. It took off late, which meant that the passengers knew through their cell phones what was happening to the hijacked planes. Knowing that they were probably going to die anyway, these passengers decided to fight back - and, along with New York City emergency workers, ended up as the great (and tragic) heroes of the day, managing to thwart the hijackers and crash the plane into an empty field in Pennsylvania.Aside from the passengers, there were three other groups looked at. The first was the hijackers themselves. I thought their portrayal was interesting. The leader of the group seemed to be portrayed as having some moral qualms about this. They came across to me as fanatical, but not evil - which is probably an accurate depiction of their mindset. Then there were the air traffic control officers. Many of them (most importantly Ben Sliney, head of the National Air Traffic Control Centre) played themselves, and considering that they weren't actors, they did a magnificent job of recreating the tension and chaos of that day. Finally, there was the military, largely centred around a NORAD base in New York State. They were frustrated - they didn't have enough fighters to properly respond, some of the fighters they had weren't armed, and even if they were armed they didn't have authority to engage the hijacked planes - that order could only be given by the President, and they couldn't reach him.This is a marvellous and touching way to honour the brave passengers of Flight 93, as well as all of those who lost their lives on a day that no one will ever forget. 10/10",10,5,10,10 June 2008
Casablanca," A Classic War Movie That Doesn't Seem Like A War Movie
","Having somehow never seen this classic movie, I was glad to have finally had the chance to watch it, and understand why it's seen as a classic. What I liked most about it was what it wasn't. Unlike most war movies that I've seen that were actually made during World War II, this has no battle scenes and no overtly patriotic binges (and what patriotism there is is French rather than American, which I found refreshing.) It comes across not as propaganda, but as a very human and very well done story about the struggles of living in Casablanca (governed by Vichy France) during the Second World War.Humphrey Bogart seemed to me to be perfectly cast as Rick Blaine - the owner of an American cafe in Casablanca who for the most part tries to stay out of politics, although his contempt for the Germans clearly comes across in a variety of scenes. Ingrid Bergman also did a great job as Ilsa, a former love interest of Rick's who desperately needs Rick's help to escape to America with her husband (played by Paul Henreid) who is a leader of the anti-Nazi underground and has escaped from a Nazi concentration camp. Bogart and Bergman were great together; to be honest I thought Bergman and Henreid were less so, although what I sensed as the awkwardness between them may well have been a deliberate way of portraying Ilsa's confusion about her feelings for Rick. Claude Rains I thought did a great job playing Police Prefect Renault. He seemed to capture the dilemma of most officials of Vichy France - as he said himself, he blows 'with the wind, and for the moment the wind is blowing from Vichy.' His relationship with the Germans is deferential, and yet one gets the impression that basically, trapped in a tough situation, he's looking out for himself, which is probably what many Vichy officials did.With a strong cast and a strong story featuring believable characters you end up with a very strong movie. It's interesting rather than exciting, and much better than most of the standard anti-Nazi patriotic binges that I've seen from the war years. (Having seen 'Casablanca' I may now be inclined to watch some of Bogart's other war era movies.) 8/10",8,2,4,28 February 2008
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Interesting Blend Of History with Action-Horror
","I have to confess that, based on the title alone, this movie has intrigued me for a long time. I have to confess as well that, based on the title alone, I've put off watching this movie for some time. It seemed a little bit - well - too strange. It seemed a little bit too obvious of an attempt to capitalize on the expectations about the blockbuster film 'Lincoln' that was due to come out just a few short months after this was released. So, with all the hype about that, let's try to put something else together that can capitalize on the interest and make a few bucks. And, to be honest, I wasn't expecting very much from this.Now, truth be told, I was somewhat surprised. 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' turns out to be a reasonably enjoyable movie. It's certainly a unique way of blending horror-style actions with a sort-of quasi- history. It starts with a mysterious and even frightening atmosphere, although that fades into a more action-oriented horror story after a while. The significant events of Lincoln's life (from the death of his mother when he was a young boy to the death of his son Will when he was president) are woven into this account of a battle against vampires, who have seen slavery as an opportunity to satisfy their thirst for blood. Ultimately, the Civil War itself is seen as part of that supernatural battle, with vampires allying themselves with the Confederacy, and the Battle of Gettysburg being essentially against vampiric Confederate forces. I'm not saying at all that the history is accurate. It's just that the movie does manage to blend a historical narrative pretty well into a fantasy.Benjamin Walker was actually not too bad as Lincoln. He was earnest, and obviously took the role very seriously. In fact, while I was glad that this didn't turn out to be a comedy that went for laughs, I did think that perhaps the greatest weakness was that at times it took itself a bit too seriously. Nevertheless it was quite watchable most of the way through. The 'train' scenes, near the end of the movie, went on a little bit too long, I thought. Yes, they were decent action scenes, but too much for me to be honest. The movie didn't end as I thought it would (which was a good thing, by the way.)Overall, while I found this to be a very watchable movie, I thought that it was a touch too over the top for my liking, and probably a little bit too long for a movie with this type of story. Interesting, though. Definitely an interesting alternative fantasy-history of Lincoln and his presidency, and what made him tick. (5/10)",5,0,1,9 September 2013
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Cute, But Doesn't Quite Make It
","There are some really nice special effects in this part live action, part animation comedy about a detective (Bob Hoskins) who has to clear the name of a cartoon character (Roger Rabbit) accused of murder. The premise of the movie (an interesting one, I concede) is that cartoon characters ('toons') are real beings of some sort with their own existence beyond the pen of the cartoonist, and who even have their own neighbourhood to live in ('Toon Town'). More than that, they can even interact with we humans. The live action and animation blend together quite nicely, and Bob Hoskins does a good job of playing Eddie Valiant - even managing to keep a straight face through most of it. (I really enjoyed the scenes in which Eddie Valiant drives an animated car.) So, why do I only rate it a 3?There's a lot of very predictable slapstick humour packed all the way through. It's funny at first but degenerates to boring after a while. There are long scenes which aren't very interesting but are apparently used to allow the 'toons' to be shown off, which is, I admit, necessary to allow the viewer to get to know some of them. But that leads in to another problem. It's hard to get truly involved with this when the movie for the most part uses cartoon characters who are completely unknown to the viewer; created, apparently, only for this movie. Setting aside the plethora of minor 'toons,' who is Roger Rabbit anyway? Jessica Rabbit? Baby Herman? The Weasels? We don't know any of these toons! Who framed Roger Rabbit? You want to know the truth? Who cares! I don't even know the guy! Now, if it were 'Who Framed Bugs Bunny' then I'd be inclined to be rooting for this unjustly accused toon. And why wasn't it? A lot of familiar cartoon characters appeared in the movie - including beloved Bugs - so the producers obviously had permission to use them. Why not focus the movie around characters we know? To me, that would have made far more sense.My last concern is about the conflict (in my view) between the content and the target audience. I'm assuming this is meant as a family movie. (I watched it on Canada's Family Channel.) Given that, I was rather surprised when the disclaimer at the beginning of the movie said that it wasn't appropriate for younger children, and was rated PG. And - fair enough. The content is too mature for the average 7 or 8 year old. But the cartoon nature of the movie makes it rather dull viewing for anyone older than that. It would be OK if you were going to watch it with your kids, but apparently given the rating you're not really supposed to. So - who's supposed to watch this anyway?It's worth a look-see if only for the special effects and for Bob Hoskins good performance, but that's about all.",3,14,34,21 April 2001
Finding Neverland," Johnny Depp Does Well With A Serious Role In A Slow Starter That Becomes Quite Touching
","I found that it took a while for this movie to really pick up steam. It seemed for a good while to be poorly structured and paced, with characters who weren't really hitting home with me. I was getting the connections. I understood that young Peter was going to be the inspiration for Peter Pan, or that Barrie's dog would have a role to play in the story, and I understood the significance of the game of cowboys and Indians. But still, somehow, this wasn't really hitting home with me. Then ... Sylvia got sick and couldn't go to opening night but the orphans showed up for the premiere of J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. That's when this took off for me and became a very powerful and very touching movie.It's the story of Scottish author and dramatist J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp), who is most famous for his creation of Peter Pan. It dramatizes the relationship he developed with young widow Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslow) and her four sons, who provide him with the inspiration for the story; who become, in a way, his 'muses.'The story takes some licence, particularly in the relationship between Barrie and the Davies family. Barrie knew Arthur Davies (the boys' father and Sylvia's husband) long before he ever met Sylvia, for example, although the movie doesn't give that impression. So the relationship between Barrie and Sylvia is a bit misleading. (In real life, Barrie claimed that he and Sylvia were engaged to be married before she died; she never mentioned this to anyone or in her will.) It still makes for a powerfully touching concluding part of the movie, though, as Sylvia laments from her sickbed that she's never seen 'Neverland,' and Barrie manages to stage a production of 'Peter Pan' for her in her home. Sylvia's obvious awe at seeing the play does touch the emotions.Depp and Winslet did well together. This was a more serious performance that we often see Depp in. I think his frequent partnership with director Tim Burton in often 'quirky' movies can give the impression that he isn't really a 'serious' actor. Teamed in this with director Marc Forster, Depp showed that he could handle a role with some depth to it.I still struggled with the first half of this, though. And, although dramatic licence with a true story doesn't usually bother me, in this case I thought a little too much dramatic licence was taken. The only movie I can think of to compare this to might be the 2006 movie 'Miss Potter,' the story of Beatrix Potter and how she developed the story of 'The Tale Of Peter Rabbit.' 'Miss Potter' was better, although this turns out to be not bad. (6/10)",6,0,0,15 August 2012
Training Day," Denzel Washington At His Finest
","The story is a bit far-fetched (seems to me that an awful lot happens in just one day - police life really is exciting!) but this movie is worth watching even if it's only to see Denzel Washington put on an unforgettable performance. Washington is, in my opinion, one of the finest actors in Hollywood today. This may not be his best performance ('Glory' and 'Philadelphia' come to mind) but it's unforgettable because it shows his versatility. Washington generally plays 'good guy' roles; here he's the corrupt LAPD narcotics officer Alonzo Harris, who recruits Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) to his squad only to set him up in a scheme he has to pay back Russian mobsters to whom he owes money.Washington's Harris comes across as believably ruthless ('the devil incarnate' my wife called him at one point.) Harris and Hawke made a great team. They seemed to have a chemistry and I hope they work together again. The movie is chock full of action and you definitely will not be bored. It contains a lot of language, but surprisingly little nudity or sexual content, focusing instead on the story itself.Watch this. You will definitely enjoy it. 8/10.",8,1,12,16 June 2002
John Wick," You Can Steal A Man's Car - You Can Beat A Man Up - But Don't Kill The Man's Dog!
","As the title clearly tells us, this movie is really about one man - John Wick. John is a sort of super (perhaps even super-human) hit man for the Russian Mob. But he's retired. He found love; he got married; everything was great; he left the life. But his wife got sick and then died, and as her parting gift to the devastated John, she arranges for him to be sent a puppy after she died. The puppy comforts him in his grief. Until ... One day he has an encounter with the son of the Russian mob boss he used to work for. They don't know each other. The guy falls in love with John's car, and later breaks into John's house, beats John up, kills John's puppy and steals John's car. It was the killing of the puppy - the last link with his beloved wife - that pushed John over the top. He's back, and he's out for revenge: bloody, merciless and remorseless revenge against anybody and everybody even remotely involved with this heinous act.That's it, more or less. The movie then goes through a whole series of bloody gunfights and fistfights and martial arts sequences as John (Keanu Reeves) single-handedly wreaks havoc on the Russian Mob in New York City. The fight scenes go on and on and on. They seem never-ending. It was a very one-dimensional part for Reeves (but, then again, most of the characters in this were one dimensional.) The point of the movie wasn't to tell a story or to give us meaningful moments and characters. They were all pretty one dimensional, working with a plot that was straightforward and largely predictable. This is obviously all leading up to the climactic confrontation. Admittedly, I wasn't entirely sure who John's final confrontation was going to be with until the son was killed with almost a half hour left to go. Clearly it wasn't him. So it goes on and on and on for a while longer.Personally, I found the last half hour quite tedious viewing. If you really like this kind of genre - violent and bloody action with little or no story - then this is a movie you've got to watch. I have to admit that this just really wasn't my style, even though I can appreciate a man wanting to take revenge for the killing of his puppy! (3/10)",3,1,5,9 September 2017
Rocketman," A Gritty And Realistic Portrayal Of Elton's Early Life But A Bit Too Heavy On The Fantasy Bits
","Given that Elton John was himself involved in the production of this film as one of the Executive Producers, I have to say that it's a courageous and at times painfully honest portrayal of Elton's early life. It pulls no punches, depicting the troubled home life he had as a young boy (and especially his troubled relationship with his father) along with his descent into booze, drugs and sex as his career took off, along with the abuse he endured in some of his early relationships. There's certainly nothing sugar coated. On the other hand, the movie portrays Elton as a prodigy, apparently destined for musical greatness from early in life. It seems a reasonable depiction of Elton's early life, set as a sort of rock opera at times, as everything is placed among various songs Elton is famous for. I thought the choreography was good, and Taron Egerton did a fantastic job of portraying Elton - surely no easy task when the man you're portraying is also the Executive Producer of the movie you're playing him in. So kudos to Egerton and to most of the rest of the cast who did a fine job and portrayed their characters believably.I thought, however, that the movie did go a little overboard in paying homage to Elton's music. At times this becomes little more than a musical with some dance routines thrown in for good measure. At times it's a bit of of fantasy, and perhaps because of that and because the movie tried so desperately to fit the story of Elton's life with Elton's music (it's a little bit like 'Mamma Mia' in that respect except that the story is true) it at times seemed a bit disjointed. The most obvious recent comparison one might make for 'Rocketman' would be 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' which told the story of Freddie Mercury and Queen, and also pulled few punches in offering us a glimpse into Mercury's life. On balance, I'd have to say that I preferred 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' which is a little surprising to me since I actually prefer Elton John's music to Queen's. But that movie flowed better and was markedly better paced than 'Rocketman.'But saying that I preferred 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is not the same as saying that I disliked 'Rocketman.' It's a very good movie - often enjoyable (if you're a fan of Elton John's music) and often quite heavy as the more troublesome aspects of Elton's life are portrayed. And it really is worth watching for Taron Egerton, who actually performed most of Elton's songs and did very well with them. And the movie does end on a high note, highlighting (through captions and pictures) Elton's life since he overcame his various demons and addictions. (7/10)",7,2,3,16 June 2019
Lone Survivor," Great Battle Scenes But It Takes A Pretty Dull First Hour To Get To Them
","Set in Afghanistan, this is based on the true story of four Navy Seals who find themselves in what seems to be a hopeless situation, trapped in an area held by the Taliban with little hope of escape. The movie captures the sense of hopelessness very well, and in that sense perhaps offers an apt metaphor for the entire US war in Afghanistan - a war entered into in a rush after 9/11 that has no truly clear objective and, thus, little way of deciding if or when victory has been achieved and no obvious plan of withdrawal. So as a historical analogy this actually works pretty well. The actual firefight that the four Seals got into with the Taliban is pretty well depicted. The basic problem with this movie is that you have to wait for about an hour before anything - and I mean anything - of interest actually happens.That first hour is a killer. You get seemingly endless scenes of Navy Seals training; you learn a lot about Navy Seals rituals; you find out that Navy Seals (like everybody else) get lonely away from their wives and girlfriends back home. That's all well established in scene after scene after scene. Yes, I suppose it gives us a bit of a feel for the men who'll be involved in the story - some raw and inexperienced and others battle hardened veterans - but that first hour of the movie could probably have been cut in half without doing any real damage to the story, and unless you're really, really interested in what the basic drag of military life looks like it's pretty hard to stick with this. All the performances are decent enough. The lead here is Mark Wahlberg, who plays Navy Seal Markus Luttrell, on whose book this was based. Wahlberg and the rest of the cast were all fine. While this movie is ostensibly a tribute to the Navy Seals (and especially those who found themselves trapped in this situation) I appreciated that the movie made clear that the Seals found sympathetic Afghan tribesmen, and that there is also a tribute to them and to the many other Afghans who oppose the Taliban, rather than leaving the viewer with the impression that all Afghans are hopeless Taliban terrorists. I haven't read Luttrell's book. The movie (as is to be expected) apparently takes some dramatic liberties with the story. That doesn't especially bother me, as long as the basics are reasonably accurate.I'll say again that the battle scenes in this movie are great - but it simply takes too long to get there.

Wind River," A Strangely Gentle But Powerful Movie Combining Sadness With A Sense Of Spirituality
","'Wind River' has only a few fleeting moments of high drama or excitement (most of them packed into a handful of scenes perhaps three quarters of the way through the film.) Basically it's a slow-paced but well-paced movie that builds towards its ultimate resolution. And there's a sense of sadness hanging over the whole thing; a reflection on past trauma; maybe some hope of being able to move forward. It's the story of the rape and murder of a young woman on an Indian reservation in Wyoming. Her body is found by a Fish and Game officer (Cory, played by Jeremy Renner.) The tribal police, led by their chief (played by Graham Greene) get involved but they're undermanned and so a young FBI agent (Jane, played by Elizabeth Olsen) is sent to lead the investigation. She's in over her head. She doesn't know reservations or Wyoming or blizzards or any of the things she'll be dealing with. That's part of the sadness. She's all that the FBI could be bothered to send for this kind of case. But she does care. She and Cory team up to find the rapist/killer. Cory's dealing with his own past - the death of his own daughter and a broken marriage to her mother, a native woman.) I thought the pacing of this was wonderful. It starts with a jolt that lasts only a minute or so and then settles down into a slow and deliberate build-up as the investigation continues. What actually happened to Natalie (the young woman who was killed) came as a surprise to me. The story leads in one direction, and then takes a sudden left turn, and then the revelation of the killer and his ultimate fate at the hands of Cory settles back into a slow and deliberate final few scenes. There's almost a sense of spirituality about this movie, I thought. It was engrossing. The wind swept and snow covered landscapes of Wyoming added to that. For a movie about a rape and murder, it was a very quiet and reflective story. When you add on to the core of the story the reflections that are contained about the harsh realities of life on the reservation, the uncaring attitude of the authorities toward natives, the loss of native culture - it was very powerful, all leading up to the closing captions which tell us that no one even bothers to keep any statistics about missing Native American women. It should make all non-Natives wonder why we're so uncaring.This is an American movie, but I think it's a very relevant and powerful movie for Canadians to watch. We have our own baggage with horrible reservation conditions and the now well-known issue of 'Missing And Murdered Indigenous Women.' I'm not sure you can watch this movie and not be stricken with a sense of horror and guilt about the conditions and attitudes Native Americans (and Native Canadians) are forced to endure. This is highly recommended watching. (8/10)",8,0,0,9 September 2018
Erin Brockovich," The Best Performance I've Seen From Julia Roberts
","I have to right off confess that I'm not a huge fan of Julia Roberts. As an actress I think she's OK but not much more than that, and I personally don't think she's the raving beauty that a lot of people think she is. That, of course, is merely a matter of personal taste on my part, but perhaps it makes my assessment of her work in 'Erin Brockovich' even more interesting. I really liked her in this! I have no argument at all with her Oscar for this role! I thought that she really got into the part of Erin and seemed to nail it - and I'm impressed by the fact that the real Erin Brockovich was involved with this film and even played a small role in it as a waitress - thus suggesting that she, too, felt that the portrayal of her was fair. In fact, on her website, the real Erin says that the movie is 98% true, with some dramatic licence taken in the other 2%. That was important for me to know, because, while Erin is the hero in this, it's not an altogether flattering portrayal of her, especially in the movie's early stages. Somewhat trashy I would say. Uneducated (which is actually not accurate), unemployed, foul-mouthed and living as a single mom to her three kids in a bug-infested home, her prospects don't appear very promising. But after being involved in a car accident, she hired lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney, who was also quite good in his role) to sue the other driver. Masry loses the case but apparently out of guilt hires her on at his law firm. Erin becomes involved in a case against a large corporation accused of causing serious health problems to residents around its plant by polluting the water with chemicals, and the movie follows the development of that case.Yes. I liked Roberts, and I liked Erin Brockovich - both the movie and the person as portrayed. This is a classic 'underdog overcomes' story. Erin obviously grows in confidence and ability as the movie progresses, and as she has to fight for recognition and respect from the families involved in the lawsuit, her fellow employees at the law firm and the various lawyers she has to deal with. At the same time, we see her struggle with the cost involved with all this - an increasingly distant relationship with her children because she's away a lot due to the case, and her inability to maintain a relationship with her neighbour George (Aaron Eckhardt) - who loves her but is increasingly resentful that she seems to view him as little more than easy child care. Good character development, well portrayed by Julia Roberts.The legal drama (although very much front and centre) is not the engine that pushes this movie forward. That's very much the portrayal of Erin the person. But the portrayal of the drama does point out the challenges involved in taking on a large corporation that has both lots of money and lots of lawyers. As you learn the stories of the affected families, you develop a sympathy for them. And yet, in some ways, the legal aspects of the film slow this down a bit. I mean, it's a true story. We pretty much know how it turns out. That takes some of the drama away from it. It does have a nice, heartwarming ending though as Erin reveals the terms of the settlement to one of the more pitiable of the plaintiffs.This is a good movie, and definitely one of Julia Roberts' best - and this from someone, as I said, who's not generally overly smitten with Julia Roberts.

Meet the Parents," Deniro And Stiller Worked Well Together
","What made this movie work so well was the combination of Robert Deniro and Ben Stiller. Both very good actors, put together they did a wonderful job of making this a very funny movie, largely by playing their roles so seriously. Stiller's character of Greg Focker was one any man can relate to - if you've ever been in the position of having to meet your girlfriend's father for the first time. In this case, the pressure was really on. Greg wants to marry Pam (Teri Polo) but finds out that her father would expect to give his permission before he even asks. So he accompanies Pam home for her sister's wedding, and discovers that Jack (Deniro) isn't your average, everyday potential father in law. Instead, he turns out to be an ex CIA agent who's extremely protective of his daughters and has more than a few quirks of his own - not the least of which is an obsession with his cat, Mr. Jinks. Desperately trying to impress Jack (or at least trying not to get on his bad side) Greg ends up unintentionally causing chaos in the home. He breaks the urn holding Jack's mother's ashes; he lets Mr. Jinks outside and loses him; he accidentally breaks Pam's sister's nose while playing volleyball; he sets fire to the backyard; he causes the septic tank to overflow. If that sounds like it might be going a bit overboard, it really doesn't go overboard. It never falls into mere slapstick humour. Greg's misadventures all seem very natural and believable. It's simply that nothing goes right on this weekend with his potential in-laws, and the end result is that Jack becomes convinced that this guy isn't good enough for his beloved first born daughter - a feeling compounded by the fact that her sister is marrying a doctor who's also the son of a doctor, while Greg is a nurse. Deniro and Stiller played off each other perfectly and produced a number of very funny scenes together.The movie was weakened a bit, in my opinion, by supporting performances that weren't as strong. Polo was very much in the background. She was likable enough, but added really very little to the movie (except that her character was necessary to push forward the tension between Jack and Greg.) Blythe Danner was underused as Pam's mother, and I found Owen Wilson's character of Kevin (Pam's ex-fiancé) to be irritating more than anything, and maybe a little too much for the story.Overall, though, this is an enjoyable movie; one of the better comedies of recent years.

Se7en," Seven Very Deadly Sins
","This journey through the mind of a religiously motivated serial killer who kills his victims based on his interpretation of the Seven Deadly Sins is a bit uneven in places, but builds very nicely to its ultimate climax, and I found that the last 20-30 minutes of the movie were very effective as a closure. The open question as the movie came to its end was how the murders depicting envy and wrath were going to be committed. That's done in a quite shocking and horrific way. I can't say it was a surprise - I guessed what was in the box addressed to Mills as soon as the box was introduced - but still it was a grand finale (if one can call it that) to a pretty decent movie.The performances from Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset and Kevin Spacey as 'John Doe' were especially effective - which they should have been, since both were pretty standard characters for the actors. Somerset was the experienced, street-wise detective who dispensed advice freely, and Spacey was the - well - kind of spacey, quirky character that he pulls off so well in so many movies. Brad Pitt was less effective as the young Detective Mills - Somerset's partner. He wasn't bad, but somehow neither his performance nor the character connected with me. Gwyneth Paltrow was underused as an actress, although her character (if not Paltrow herself) plays a central role in the end.The movie seemed to have a bit of a 'Silence of the Lambs' feel to it, with the serial killer angle and the mind games being played with the police, and the real attention getter through most of the movie was to find out how the deadly sins were going to be represented by the murders that were being committed. I was a little concerned that this had the potential to turn into little more than a gore-fest, but that didn't happen. There are some gruesome shots of the victims, but for the most part the focus was on the psychological dimensions of the story. All in all I thought this was a very good movie; 'Seven' gets a 7 from me.",7,0,0,18 June 2008
Star Trek," A Well Done Re-Imagining Of The Star Trek Franchise
","When I first heard about this project, I must confess that I had my doubts. It seemed as if the Star Trek franchise had been worked to death and had run out of steam and would perhaps be better left as a memory. Why bother essentially re-making the original with all of the same characters. I must confess that I was wrong. This was very well done. Thanks to the presence of all the old characters (and I even appreciated the re-appearance of the old style uniforms from the original TV series) this had a very familiar feel to it, but the story that was developed (having to do with a Romulan who comes from the future to avenge what he perceives to be the Federation's responsibility for the destruction of Romulus) provided enough of a 'tweak' on the characters (the time travel having altered the original timeline, of course) that while familiar this had as well a definite air of originality to it. The actors were well chosen for the roles. As the leads, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto (as Kirk and Spock respectively) put their own stamps on the characters, but again still came across as the Kirk and Spock that fans of the old series remember. Even the lesser characters (McCoy, Scotty, Sulu, Chekov and Uhura - they were all there) came across as 'the same but different,' if that makes any sense. The story was well-paced and interesting. There was at times a bit of a 'Star Wars' feel to this as opposed to a 'Star Trek' feel, but that was presumably a reflection of the desire to appeal to a modern audience (and the earlier feature films of the franchise also fell into that tendency as well.) One thing that was lacking was any significant moral or philosophical reflection, which was often a feature of both ST and ST:TNG. This movie instead went for action, and did that well.Even given the differences in the timeline explained by the opening time travel, there were some things about the story that made little sense to me. Chekov was a 17 year old ensign? (He wasn't even around in the first season of the original TV series!) This meant that he was a commissioned officer while Kirk was still a cadet. And, of course, Kirk - as a cadet - goes immediately to First Officer and then Captain of the Enterprise? That stretched credibility a bit for me. There was also the problem that the story seemed to suggest that Star Fleet recruited its cadets (or at least lifted them into space) from Iowa? Nothing against Iowa, but ...In any event, the presence of Leonard Nimoy as the older Spock from the future was a nice connecting point, although one hopes that Nimoy disappears in the sequel. Nothing against him, but if this is a going to be a restart of the franchise, it's time to let the new group get on with it. Also at the end of the movie, it would have been a better choice to have the closing narration ('Space, the final frontier ...') read by either (1) William Shatner, thus making a final connection, or, even better (2) Chris Pine as the new Kirk, rather than by Nimoy. However, on the subject of the ending, it was nice to hear the original theme music used so proudly. Good movie. It will be interesting to see if the sequel measures up and if this marks the re-ignition of the franchise. 7/10",7,2,9,1 January 2010
Fury," Simple And Straightforward With Some Excellent Tank Battle Scenes
","If you're looking for a deep and well developed plot, then 'Fory' will probably disappoint. It's a very straightforward and even simple story of an American tank crew in the last days of World War II. Battle hardened and perhaps a bit cynical as a result, these Americans for the most part are not the honourable heroes that American movies usually portray. They've become as vicious as anyone else. They'll mercilessly kill their prisoners, they'll rape German women. There's repeated reflections on how bad the SS are whenever they're encountered - but under the surface there's a sense that this particular tank crew at least isn't all that much better. They kill indiscriminately, with little hesitation and few attacks of conscience. It's all to paint a broad picture of war as brutal and ugly. It dehumanizes warriors, turning them int killing machines. It's a very bloody and graphic and violent movie, featuring some of the most vicious tank battles I've ever come across on film. It isn't a movie that's going to give you the warm fuzzies, nor does it create heroes. It's not a very likable movie - and yet, I enjoyed it.First, I liked the lead performances from Brad Pitt as Sgt. Collier (the commander of the tank crew) and Logan Lerman as Norman (a clerk typist who somehow got assigned to tank duty. Logan was not welcomed or respected by the crew. He didn't want to kill; he didn't really want to fight. He wanted to type. He still saw the Germans as people rather than enemies. I liked the portrayal of the bond that developed between Collier and Norman. Collier took him under his wing in a sense - protected him somewhat from the abuse of the crew and treated him decently, all the while preparing him for war. Norman gradually evolves and - sadly in some ways - by the end of the movie becomes a savage warrior like the others. I found myself kind of wanting Norman to stay more human; his gradual transformation was a little bit sad. The rest of the tank crew (played by actors like Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal) were pretty one dimensional.The best scenes of the movie are probably in the German apartment where Collier and Norman hook up with two German women - one of whom seemed very young and innocent - much like Norman, actually. There's a tension to those scenes. Norman takes her into a bedroom and we assume they have sex - but it didn't seem to be a savage rape. This was Norman. The two seemed genuinely to like each other and found something with each other in the midst of the insanity around them. The girl's death as a civilian casualty when the Americans are attacked seems to be the turning point for Norman.As I said, this is a pretty simple and straightforward movie - but it does have some good moments of reflection and humanity.

Monster," Superb Performance By Charlize Theron
","Generally speaking, I've always enjoyed both the work and the movies of Charlize Theron, and even on occasion when I've not particularly enjoyed the movie, Theron's performances have impressed me. Having said that, everything else she's done pales in comparison to this superb performance as Aileen Wuornos - the real-life prostitute/murderess, who killed several johns in 1989-90 before being arrested and ultimately executed. I would never have thought of Theron - who is a very beautiful woman - being able to pull off this part as a run-down, 'weather beaten' street hooker, and yet she did it brilliantly.The portrayal of Wuornos was surprisingly sympathetic, I thought, given the circumstances. Although there was nothing portrayed of her childhood, the stories she shares make the point that it was pretty tough, and the portrayal of the initial murder makes clear that it was self-defense, but it began a spiral downward, which was accelerated by her growing lesbian relationship with Selby (Christina Ricci), which seemed sincere enough, and which made the need for money to support both of them more desperate. That relationship itself adds to the sympathy felt for the two, as both are clearly troubled women in need of some love and tenderness who, at least for a time, find both with each other.The story seems reasonably accurate, although 'Selby' was not the actual name of Aileen's lover. Theron and Ricci had good on-screen chemistry together, and the story itself is quite riveting and, given the circumstances and what could have been done with it, not as graphic as it could have been - and I say that in a positive way. 9/10",9,0,1,18 April 2009
The Birth of a Nation," Technically Brilliant Piece Of Pro-KKK Propaganda
","'The Birth Of A Nation' is technically brilliant - certainly, even after 95 years, the best film quality I've ever seen in a silent film, and a movie featuring very good acting which, in spite of its 3 hour plus length, is well-paced, never dull and which also features an entirely appropriate musical score. From that perspective alone, it's a brilliant piece of movie-making from the famous D.W. Griffith.To modern sensibilities, of course, the movie presents a troubling perspective. In fairness, having heard how horribly racist this movie was, I didn't find that it met my expectations of how racist I would find it - which isn't to say that it isn't racist, just that I thought it would be worse. It follows a tried and true Civil War formula of a friendship between Northern and Southern families, with the inevitable romances developing, which is disrupted by the War. The War itself, I thought, was fairly presented. War itself was not at all glorified, although certainly the Confederate soldier was portrayed as a noble one, even venturing into the midst of a battlefield to offer water to a wounded Union officer, while the Union troops are generally portrayed as marauders (and there's a heavy emphasis on black Union soldiers, when in fact there weren't really that many black Union soldiers.) Sarcasm is used against some northern figures - Gen. Sherman being described as the 'great conqueror' and then it being pointed out that his great march to the sea was largely against women and children. There's a surprisingly positive portrayal of Lincoln and equally surprising to me was the lack of any portrayal at all of Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor, who is usually a figure who lends himself to caricature. The central figure of the movie was a character named Austin Stoneman, representative of the Radicals (and based on Thaddeus Stevens.) The movie eventually portrays him as a hypocrite, delighted when South Carolina's 'mulatto' Lieut. Gov. Silas Lynch tells him that he wants to marry a white woman; appalled when he discovers that the white woman is his own daughter. The first half of the movie depicts the Civil War, the second the era of reconstruction, focusing on the rise of the KKK, who are portrayed as the great defenders of Southern society against blacks and northern carpetbaggers. There's also the pretty typical portrayal of southern blacks (both before and after the war) as pretty happy folk who didn't need to be set free at all (after all, they only worked from 6 to 6, and 2 hours of that was set aside for dinner!) I was also surprised to see the use of the word 'Aryan,' which I hadn't realized was in common usage in the pre-Nazi era.I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be few actual black actors used in this - the primary black characters looking to me as if they were all white actors in black face. Perhaps there just weren't that many black actors available in 1915. I also thought Griffith cunningly attempted to deflect what he clearly expected to be criticisms of the movie with the use (about halfway through the film, as the second part opens) of a number of writings by Woodrow Wilson - who, of course, was President in 1915.This is a truly fascinating movie, well worth watching, no matter how troubling the portrayal of the KKK as heroes might be. 8/10",8,2,5,25 July 2009
Memento," Certainly A Unique And Interesting Premise
","It's certainly a unique concept. Leonard, played by Guy Pearce, is a man who has no short-term memory after being attacked when trying to save his wife from a rape-murder. The rest of his life is spent in a quest for revenge - a revenge he can't remember if he's ever been able to achieve because he has no short-term memory. That's an interesting enough premise, the added piece here being the decision to offer us the story in reverse chronology - beginning with Leonard killing the man he believes to be his wife's killer (played by Joe Pantoliano) and then scene by scene retracing the story, going back just a bit at a time to fill in the details of his search, and how he came to the conclusion that Teddy was responsible. Essentially, then, the viewer is pulled into Leonard's own condition - seeing what's happening with no clue as to how it came about because we haven't seen what came before. Edited into the regression scenes are black and white scenes in which Leonard, holed up in his hotel room, essentially talks about his condition and seems to fill in some essential details about his past.It's an interesting way to present a 'whodunit' - because the question all the way through is whether Teddy is actually the killer. The ending offers up a twist - although it isn't the biggest surprise you'll ever see, if only because the way the movie is put together you're conditioned from the beginning to expect pretty much any twist possible, it still leaves open a decent bit of uncertainty about who actually killed Lenny's wife. So, the premise and construction of the story is interesting enough. Also interesting, though, is that - while it's intriguing - I just didn't find it particularly enjoyable to watch. Perhaps it's because I didn't buy Leonard's condition - for one reason. He used photographs to jog his memory, so he took pictures of important people, places, etc,. to refer to when necessary. What's wrong with that? Well - nothing, I suppose, except that I found it passing strange that, for a guy who supposedly forgets everything within a couple of minutes of it happening, he always knew exactly which pocket to find the pictures in. He NEVER had to search for one of his photographs; there was never even a moment of hesitation when he had to refer to one. That's a small point, perhaps, but it caused a bit of a credibility gap for me. The movie's well acted by the leads and interesting enough as the pieces of the puzzle are sorted out, but for me it fizzled a bit on that admittedly relatively small point. 5/10",5,2,4,21 September 2009
Inglourious Basterds," A Rare Movie That Combines A Lot Of Fun With A Lot Of Violence
","The movie begins with a scene that definitely pulls you in. In Nazi occupied France in 1941, A German officer (Landa, played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz) arrives at a French farmhouse. Nicknamed 'the Jew hunter,' he's looking for Jews being sheltered by the locals. With little option, the owner gives up his Jewish refugees only to see them murdered in front of his eyes, except for the daughter, who manages to escape. In the next scene, we see a group of American commandos formed under the leadership of Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and consisting of 8 Jewish soldiers. Their mission: to get into France and kill as many Germans as they can - without mercy; and not just kill - they're to terrorize them and scalp them once they're dead, letting one escape each time to spread the news, with a Nazi swastika permanently carved into their forehead so that they'll never escape their Nazi past.From there we find two different stories take root and develop: one of the young Jewish girl who seeks revenge; the other of the American commandos in France. Eventually, the two stories intersect (unknown to those involved in either) and the end result is a fascinating piece of alternative history in which the entire Nazi leadership (Hitler, Goring, Bormann and Goebbels) are wiped out in a Paris cinema as they watch a German propaganda movie.This is a very violent movie with many graphic scenes. Frankly, it's probably not for the squeamish. Interestingly though, it manages a surprising balance - while extremely violent, it's also both fun and funny at times. The scene near the end when Raine and his men struggle to speak believable Italian (with terrible American accents) in the cinema to Col. Landa is brief, but hilarious. All the performances are good - most notably, in addition to those already mentioned, Melanie Laurent as Shoshanna and Martin Wittke as Hitler were standouts. It's a little bit long, mind you, and a few things seemed less than believable - why, for example, would such an important German propaganda film be premiered in occupied Paris rather than Berlin? Still, this is very powerful for a completely fictional film.",7,0,3,21 March 2010
Amistad," An Excellent Historical Recreation
","The story of the Amistad slaveship revolt and the subsequent court case over the fate of the Africans who revolted isn't particularly well known but gets a well deserved high profile treatment from Steven Spielberg in this movie that fairly faithfully recounts the events all the way from the journey of the Amistad across the Atlantic to the final decision of the U.S. Supreme Court.As a historical re-creation this is excellent and captures a number of different angles and competing interests in the case. Most importantly, of course, are the Africans themselves, led by a passionate but articulate man known as Cinque, who was played brilliantly by Djimon Hounsou. The court case revolved around the issue of whether these particular blacks were born in Africa (and thus not able to be imported into the United States as slaves) or whether they were born in Cuba, and were therefore mere property. The case is taken on by lawyer Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConnaughey) and then, in front of the Supreme Court, by former United States President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins.) Hopkins offered a very moving monologue before the Supreme Court near the end of the movie. Morgan Freeman also plays a significant role as a former slave turned businessman who apparently partially funds the case. We feel for the plight of the Africans. From the opening scenes of the movie - even though the revolt is bloody and violent - we feel sympathy for them and their plight. Their story is fascinating, emotional and ultimately heartwarming.Many other issues are looked at in the movie. There's the political dilemma of Martin Van Buren (the incumbent U.S. President, played by Nigel Hawthorne) who is facing inevitable defeat in the upcoming election and for whom the Amistad case is a nightmare, as he risks losing the support of the south over it. There's the diplomatic manoeuvring between Spain (represented by its 11 year old Queen) and the U.S. There's the complicated issue of North vs. South, which by 1840 was becoming a monumental problem in the U.S. There's the issue of judicial independence. With so much going on, it's really quite a fascinating movie to watch.It is at times perhaps a little bit too detailed in all honesty. Some of the legal proceedings might be a great interest to legal scholars, but some of it also went over my head to be honest. I mean, I got the basic issue - if they were born in Africa, they were free; if they were born in Cuba they were slaves. I just felt that some of the legal proceedings went on a bit too long, and at time slowed the movie down unnecessarily. All the performances in it are good, though, and one has to be impressed that in spite of the fact that 7 of the 9 Supreme Court justices were from the South, the Supreme Court nevertheless ruled in favour of the Africans, freed them and allowed them to return to Africa. It's a well- done movie worth watching for those with an interest in the broad subject of U.S. slavery. (7/10)",7,0,2,28 August 2011
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Love And War And Occupation
","After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight. After German intervention, Greece is conquered and the island Pelagia lives on comes under Italian occupation, during which Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage.) This, of course, was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands. As they got to know their occupiers, they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people, and sometimes fell in love - often to the disapproval of their neighbours. I just finished reading an interesting book about the German occupation of Britain's Channel Islands in which this was a major issue. Once Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them.The second background issue is the Italian occupation itself, which I thought was quite realistically portrayed. First was the contempt with which the island treated their Italian occupiers. Greece defeated Italy (quite true from a historical perspective) and was really conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the town to surrender to the Italians and instead to insist on surrendering to a German officer struck me as something that could well have happened (and was quite funny in fact. I loved the line, 'we would rather surrender to this German's dog than to you Italians.') The portrayal of the Italian troops also struck me as believable. The Italian Army was never enamoured of their German ally, and never enthusiastic about fighting with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt. Here, the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting (which the German troops on the island simply can't understand,) and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war - until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the Germans. It was all quite well done, I thought.It falters a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish, but still deserves praise.7/10",7,34,45,11 August 2002
The Fan," Putting The 'Fan' Into 'Fanatic'
","To talk about the movie as a whole, one has to say right off the topic that this isn't especially great. In fact, it may not even be especially good. It's the story of Gil Renard (Robert De Niro) - a former little league star who never made the majors but who's become a fanatical fan of the San Francisco Giants. Gil is also a knife salesman - and a fading one. His marriage has broken up, he's on the outs with his ex-wife, who eventually gets a restraining order to keep him away from their son after he abandons him at a ball game and then forces his way into their house to apologize. So, he's got a lot of personal problems. The 'fading salesman with problems' character seems to have more than a little bit in common with characters like Willy Loman in 'Death of a Salesman' or Shelley Levene in 'Glengarry Glen Ross.' I would guess that both were probably at least a little bit of an influence for Peter Abrahams, who wrote the book on which this was based, and Phoef Sutton, who adapted it as a screenplay.De Niro is excellent in the part. To draw another parallel, his portrayal as the obsessed, psychotic fan reminded me a bit of his performance as Max Cady in 'Cape Fear.' De Niro has the talent and the presence to pull these kinds of characters off, and to be believable while doing it, which isn't always easy. Renard is both obsessed and psychotic. He becomes particularly obsessed with Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) - a $40 million free agent signing by the Giants who struggles as the season starts, and gets into a battle with Juan Primo (Benecio del Toro) - who was moved from centre field to left field to make room for Rayburn, but who won't give up Rayburn's favourite #11. While Rayburn slumps, Primo becomes a star. The fans turn against Rayburn and embrace Primo. There's some reflection here on the fickleness of sports fans - the 'what have you done for me lately' attitude - as well as on the big money that players make. But Gil is on Rayburn's side. He wants Rayburn to succeed - and he becomes obsessed with Rayburn, to the point at which he goes to great lengths to 'help' him (watch the movie), and then, when Rayburn won't thank him for what he did, he kidnaps the star's son and threatens to kill him unless Rayburn hits a home run in the next game and publicly dedicates it to Gil. That's the story in a nutshell.Overall, the story isn't that compelling to be honest. Aside from De Niro's performance, which is excellent throughout, there really wasn't a lot to this. It takes a very long time for the movie to really get going. Most of the first hour or so is tied up with Gil's personal troubles with his job and his son. I didn't think we really needed that long to understand that the character is mentally unstable. Snipes tried hard, and he wasn't bad, but his character was less than compelling. He came across as little more than an arrogant, self-centred millionaire ball player until the angle with his son was introduced. There was very little interesting about the character. Some of the baseball action portrayed had problems. To mention something that really stood out for me - every time Rayburn was portrayed coming up to bat, he went to the batters' box from the dugout? Shouldn't he have been in the on deck circle if he was next up? Minor point perhaps, but it bugged me a bit.The last half hour (once Rayburn's son is kidnapped) is fairly tense; the last scenes on the field are way too over the top unfortunately. So, no, this isn't really a great movie. It's watchable for De Niro's performance. As far as the story is concerned, you really haven't missed much if you haven't seen this. (5/10)",5,2,3,8 June 2013
Shakespeare in Love," I'm Not Sure Why This Didn't Strike Home With Me
","I want to say right off the top that there's is a lot to really like about this movie. First, the performances of the two leads (Joseph Fiennes as Shakespeare and Gwyneth Paltrow as Lady Viola) were excellent, and the supporting performances from folks such as Colin Firth, Judi Dench, Ben Affleck and Simon Callow were equally good. The sets offered a wonderful feel of Elizabethan England and the costumes were magnificent. It was the overall story that just didn't capture me, and even there I'm not sure why. It had a lot of comedic potential. Shakespeare is suffering from writer's block as he struggles with a deadline to write a play called 'Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.' (!) That alone has to be good for a few laughs. His writer's block seems to be directly related to his lack of a female muse, whose love would inspire him. Into that void steps Lady Viola, who not only falls in love with Shakespeare, in spite of the fact that she's to be married, but ends up starring as Romeo, once she disguises herself as a man (because women weren't allowed on the stage in Elizabethan England.) Shakespeare discovers the truth and the two begin a passionate love affair that overcomes Shakespeare's difficulty and he produces not 'Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter' but instead 'Romeo and Juliet.'I don't really know what the problem was. I can't pinpoint anything in particular except to say that the story (as promising and well portrayed as it was) just didn't draw me in. By all means, watch it. Obviously, a lot of people like it, and I can't really find fault with it. It just didn't grab me. (5/10)",5,0,1,30 May 2012
Dawn of the Dead," A Surprisingly Good Zombie Movie!
","Back in 1968, 'Night of the Living Dead' did a really good job with the whole concept of zombies, and of those who weren't zombies being trapped in a hopeless situation as they struggled to find a way to survive. Somehow after that, though, the whole 'zombie' craze seemed to lose its footing. Any such movies I've happened upon have really been rather silly with nothing much to be taken seriously and nothing much to commend them. Then I happened upon 'Dawn of the Dead.' This movie manages to get the whole zombie thing right, and the end result is a movie that works really well from start to finish.There's no science in this; nobody spends much time trying to explain what's happening. The closest might be Ana (played by Sarah Polley) finally figuring out that the zombie 'infection' is caused by a bite - although that was a bit anti-climactic. I mean, wasn't it rather obvious? But there's no time wasted offering much in the way of explanation. This is just happening. There are living dead everywhere seeking to bite and kill others, who will then turn into zombies themselves. In keeping with the simplicity, the movie jumps right into the mystery. After a brief opening scene in which Ana (a nurse) puzzles as her shift ends about why a man who was hurt in a fight would end up in the ICU, we go right into the action, and the opening zombie attacks (without giving too much away) are both shocking and terrifying. Ana ends up bound together with a group of survivors who hole up in a local shopping mall while they try to figure out how they're going to get out of this mess.This is very frightening at times, and - be warned if this bothers you - it's very, very bloody. The sense of hopelessness is real, and although the ultimate fate of the survivors we've been following isn't really made clear, there's no sense left by the end of the movie that theirs will be a happy ending. Give credit to those who put this together. It's an excellent movie, although I confess that I personally didn't really see the humour in using background music like 'Don't Worry Be Happy' and 'You Light Up My Life.' It was meant to have a degree of irony, I guess, given the situation. I just found it out of place. Still, a very good movie with a lot of chills and a pretty decent cast.

World War Z," This Has Far More Weaknesses Than Strengths
","There's no point comparing the book to the novel. At best in any situation that's a fool's game. Movies are movies; novels are novels. They're just an entirely different genre. As much as the criticism that the movie isn't like the book may have validity, it's not really that relevant. Treat this as a movie and consider it on that basis. On that basis, it has both strengths and weaknesses. Let's start with the weaknesses, because they start leaping out right from the start, and they're more numerous.This seems to be a perfectly normal weekday morning in Philadelphia. There's nothing out of the ordinary. The Lane family wakes up and goes about their business, climbing into the car to head wherever they're all going. The only remotely newsworthy thing happening is a news report about an outbreak of rabies in various parts of the world. There are, however, no reports of problems in the United States. OK. There's a big traffic jam, and no explanation, but Philadelphia's a big city; unexplained traffic jams are probably not uncommon. Then, all of a sudden, with no warning, there are police and military aircraft racing ahead of the traffic jam - and Philadelphia is infested with zombies! Really? With no warning that anything was amiss? Really? I mean, if something was wrong Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) seems like the kind of guy who would have known. He's a former UN Inspector, who certainly has contacts as we learn. But this just pops up suddenly? Implausible at best, and given that it's happening all over US and international cities, just hard to accept. I get that a virus could spread rapidly because of air travel - but this was just too much. Add to that the fact that the 'zombies' didn't really scare me all that much and had a bit of a sense of silliness about them, as well as the fact that none of the characters really hit home with me as people I connected with and cared about, and you have serious weaknesses.The basic strength of the movie is that it is mysterious (partly, I confess, caused by the implausible suddenness of the outbreak) and it is suspenseful, as you wonder whether there's any sort of solution to the outbreak, or whether this is just an ongoing battle against a hopeless situation. But it really would have helped if I had been given a character to care about. Even Pitt's Gerry failed to draw me in to the story. The result was that, Pitt's obvious recognizability aside, the performances here faded into the background.I'm thinking that zombie lovers will be underwhelmed by this. Personally, if I need a zombie fix, AMC's 'The Walking Dead' is actually better. (5/10)",5,1,4,10 March 2014
Seven Years in Tibet," A Slow Paced Disappointment
","I guess it depends on what you were hoping to find with this movie, but I found 'Seven Years In Tibet' to be a slow-paced disappointment. I was hoping to come out of this with a deeper understanding and appreciation of Tibetan Buddhist spirituality. Unfortunately, aside from learning that Tibetan Buddhists respect all life and won't harm it (down to and including the lives of worms) I really didn't find much reflection of Tibetan Buddhist spirituality here. There were a lot of Tibetan customs portrayed, but I personally found little depth and no real explanation or exploration. (And, even the Tibetan Buddhist commitment to reverence for life and non-violence is obviously conditional, since the Tibetans apparently had no qualms about forming an army in a desperate attempt to beat back the Chinese.) One gets a picture here of the deep reverence in which the Dalai Lama is held by Tibetans, and of the somewhat xenophobic attitude of the Tibetans, but I found little more.The movie revolves around the experiences of Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian mountain climber who, on the eve of World War II, sets out to conquer one of the highest mountains in the Himalayas to plant the Nazi Swastika flag on its summit. Harrer was a difficult to define character. He certainly didn't come across as a devout Nazi (he insisted on calling himself an Austrian rather than a German) and he seemed to have little interest in the swastika flag that was presented to him to plant. While there might be some admiration for him on that basis, he's also an unsympathetic character as the movie starts, leaving his wife and yet unborn son in the midst of a difficult relationship. Failing to conquer the mountain, his team descends to India just as the war breaks out and he's arrested by the British as an enemy alien and sent to a POW camp, from which he escapes and makes his way to Tibet - his time and experiences there being the primary focus of the movie. Harrer clearly 'finds himself' (if I can use that term) and becomes attached to the country, the people and the Dalai Lama in the process. As the movie ends, this takes on an overtly anti-Chinese (or, at least, an anti-People's Republic of China) feel, as the Chinese brutally invade and conquer Tibet - an occupation lasting to this day.)Brad Pitt was good in the role. I have no complaint with his performance. In fact, all the performances were good, especially that of the young actor who played the 14 year old Dalai Lama. There's some spectacular scenery (which, unfortunately, is not actually of Tibet, the mountain scenes being shot as I understand it in Argentina and Canada.) I simply would have liked a more fulfilling look at Tibetan Buddhist spirituality, and so came away somewhat disappointed with this.",3,1,5,24 July 2010
The Hunger Games," It Struck Me As Little More Than 'Survivor: Extreme'
","Since 'The Hunger Games' seems to have been pretty well received, I'm going to be going out on a limb here, but I just didn't care for it. I'll confess that I haven't read the book. Apparently some consider it a rip-off of a movie called 'Battle Royale' - which I haven't seen. So I really didn't have any pre-conceived notions about this going in. I watched it because I had heard a lot of people liked it. So much for popular opinion.I came out of this feeling as if I had just been subjected to almost two and a half hours of 'Survivor: Extreme.' In this case, it would be extreme because there's really only one survivor. In some future nightmare world, a government uses The Hunger Games as a punishment for a long ago uprising. Every year each of 12 Districts that rebelled has to send two young people (one male and one female) to do battle with one another and form alliances and kill each other off until only one is left. Meanwhile, this has become this society's version of reality TV, as the whole thing is televised, and the 'tributes' (the young people in the battle) are interviewed. I suppose if you think about it, it's not actually a bad social commentary about our own society which gets so fixated on the drivel of our own reality TV. But I didn't find it entertaining. Somehow, watching a bunch of teenagers trying to kill each other didn't appeal to me all that much. There's also the fact that I really didn't care that much for any of the characters. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is a bit sympathetic, especially as she tends to young Rue (Amandla Stenberg) - and certainly, Katniss and Peeta Josh Hutcherson) are the only two characters (aside from Rue) that you really could root for, but I still didn't feel much for them.I honestly didn't know what to expect coming into this. I had no idea what the movie was about. In the end, I can't say that watching this was a highlight for me. (3/10)",3,3,4,11 November 2012
12 Monkeys," Brilliantly Disorienting
","This certainly isn't your average, run of the mill movie about time travel. It's a confusing and disorienting story that left me at least guessing for much of its run time about what actually was reality. The performance from Bruce Willis was wonderful. As James Cole, he plays a prisoner in a nightmar-ish future earth, where most of humanity has been wiped out by a virus, and the remainder have had to retreat underground. Cole is chosen to go back into the past to the point just before the plague erupted, not to prevent it - because you can't prevent what's already happened - but to bring a sample of the virus back to his time.Willis did a marvellous job with this character. He is himself disoriented from the start (time travel isn't as easy as some movies make it out to be) and, making no sense to anyone he speaks to, he finds himself locked up in a mental institution.It's in the mental institution that we meet the other two central characters: Dr. Raillis (Madeleine Stowe), who starts with the assumption that Cole is insane but gradually comes to believe his story, and Brad Pitt as Jeffrey Goines, the unbalanced son of a famous scientist who's central to how the virus is released.What I really liked about this movie is that almost to the end, as a viewer I had some doubts about Cole: was he really from the future or was he delusional. That's finally answered, but it took a while and it was fun to speculate. It's a well done movie, often chaotic and confusing and disorienting, which was actually a good way of getting the viewer into the head of Cole, who must have been feeling exactly the same way.

Mississippi Burning," Sometimes It Makes You Mad; Sometimes You Just Want To Cry
","It's rare that you find a movie with so many sobering moments that stay with you when the movie's finished, but Mississippi Burning is full of those moments. Some are just sobering - like the shot of the two water fountains, one brand spanking new, marked 'Whites' and one old and run down, marked 'Coloreds.' Some scenes are unsettling, with overly racist and obnoxious things being said - 'niggers don't even take baths and they stink!' Some scenes are frightening - little children laughing and applauding along with their parents at Ku Klux Klan rallies. Then there's the violence - lynchings and beatings and murders of local blacks. This isn't a movie for the feint of heart. It isn't a 'pleasant' movie at all, but it's certainly a powerful one.It's loosely based on the murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, and it revolves around the two FBI agents leading the investigation - Ward (Willem Dafoe) and Andersen (Gene Hackman). This was a powerful performance from both men. Hackman I expected that from, because I consistently like Gene Hackman's work, and he was nominated for an Oscar for this role. Dafoe I have had mixed reactions to over the years, but he was very good in this. Ward and Andersen are both FBI agents, but very different in their approach. Ward is a Northerner, and wants to do things by the book. Andersen is a southerner who knows that 'by the book' won't cut it when dealing with racists and the Klan. Watching them work out their relationship is interesting.There's a large number of secondary characters, all of whom have significant roles to play in the unfolding of the story. The most important of them is probably 'Mrs. Pell' (played by Frances McDormand, who was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar) - the wife of one of the sheriff's deputies implicated in the murders. Her Oscar nomination aside, I admit that I wasn't really taken with the character of Mrs. Pell and the implication of some type of friendship or relationship brewing with Andersen, although the scene in which her husband deals with his 'problem at home' (as one of his good ole boy buddies called her) is brutal, and another of those scenes that stays with you.The name of the movie refers to the name of the FBI investigation, although it's put to good use as there are repeated scenes throughout the movie of the burning of black churches and homes, with a few burning crosses thrown in as well. It is unsettling and at times unpleasant to watch, but it's also very good. (8/10)",8,1,1,25 February 2015
The Impossible," A Brilliant Portrayal Of A Horrible Disaster
","Yes. The movie was 'anglicized.' The 'true' story on which this is based was actually the story of a Spanish family and not an English family. That bothers some people. I have to say that it didn't really bother me. Whenever I come across the 'true' story tag on a movie, I always assume that the term should be interpreted loosely. The point of this particular 'true' story didn't depend on the identity of the family. To me, at least, who admittedly watched this tragedy unfold on television in the safety of my home in Canada, the story was 'true' in the sense that it gave a harrowingly realistic depiction of what it might have been like to have been on the coast of Thailand on December 26, 2004, when the massive tsunami struck.This film moves quickly into the story. There's a very brief depiction of the family on the plane, and a very brief depiction of Christmas, and then - suddenly and without any warning - the tsunami strikes, as the family are playing at a pool at a resort. The depiction of the tsunami is quite terrifying. It was an excellent job of recreating the disaster and giving those of us watching as much of a feel as we possibly could have. The immediate aftermath of the tsumani follows mother Maria and son Lucas, who struggle together with the raging waters and finally manage to get to a hospital. All the while father Henry, and sons Thomas and Simon are desperately trying to find them. You can feel the chaos of the situation, and the movie goes from one emotionally gut wrenching scene to another almost all the way through. The performances from the cast who played the family were brilliant. All were totally and completely believable in their depiction of their terror and their utter lostness.There are a few minor quibbles one can make about this aspect of the story or that aspect of the story having been changed. I daresay those types of quibbles are always possible when dealing with a movie based on a 'true' story. But this movie succeeded in what I believe its purpose was: to use the experience of one family to give the viewer just a taste of what had happened in Thailand on December 26, 2004 and its aftermath. In fact, it succeeded brilliantly. (10/10)",10,1,5,8 June 2013
42," Breaking The Colour Barrier
","I've sometimes said that while baseball is not my favourite sport, it is the closest thing there is in sports to a spiritual experience. It's gentle and comfortable and then all of a sudden it briefly bursts forth with periods of excitement. For the most part you could say that about this movie. It's a good movie. It's not full of excitement. It is, for much of the time, a rather sensitive portrayal of racism, how to combat racism, and - of course - of Jackie Robinson's struggle against racism as he makes his way to the major leagues.As a baseball movie, this is very well done. There's an authenticity to the on-field action. It's all quite believable; none of it looks staged or acted. But it isn't a baseball movie, of course. It's a movie about racism, with baseball in the background.I never saw Jackie Robinson play. He retired from baseball seven years before I was born. But, of course, I know a lot about his story. The movie seems an accurate (if somewhat tame, to be honest) portrayal of Robinson's experiences. My own impression, from what I've read, is that Robinson was treated much worse than what we see here - where the worst example of racism directed at him is the disgraceful conduct of Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman, who ruthlessly taunted Robinson with racist comments the first time the Phillies played the Dodgers - although that incident helped cement Robinson's place as part of the team. Chadwick Boseman was excellent as Robinson, effectively portraying Robinson's attitude - bristling at the racism he had to endure but controlling himself at the request of Dodgers owner Branch Rickey, who told him that he didn't want a man with the guts to fight back, but rather a man with the guts not to fight back. Boseman's portrayal was very good, as was Harrison Ford's as Rickey.There were a couple of decisions I might quibble with. There was no portrayal of Robinson's appearance in the 1947 World Series after the Dodgers won the pennant, although I suppose that would have been anti- climactic, since the Dodgers lost to the Yankees and Robinson didn't have a great series. There was also no portrayal at all of his time in Montreal with the Dodgers minor league affiliate, the Montreal Royals - although, again, that would have been anti-climactic, since Jackie's wife Rachel (played in the movie by Nicole Beharie) said years later that she had only good memories of Montreal, and that she and Jackie never had a problem in the time they lived there. So, I understand both of those omissions, but it still seemed to me to leave a gap.Overall, I'd say this is a good movie - much like a good baseball game. It doesn't go into a great deal of depth about the story - much like Rickey advised Robinson, it's almost as if those who wrote the script and Brian Helgeland who directed it were keeping everything in check. A lot of it is pretty slow moving and not especially exciting, but there's enough interesting things in it to make you appreciate having watched it. (7/10)",7,2,2,19 July 2013
Rocky V," A Sad Ending To A Tired Series
","Oh the depths to which the Academy Award winning 'Rocky' eventually fell. I can understand Sylvester Stallone wanting to have some closure with the 'Rocky' series by bringing it full circle - especially after the abysmal 'Rocky IV.' The problem is that this fifth installment in the series is only marginally better than the previous disaster. There might be some spoilers coming up, so beware from here on in. Everything in this movie is stale. It's been done before in the series. We even have Burgess Meredith back in this one, with either some old film that was cut from the original movie, or some new footage that he shot especially for this, as Rocky flashes back to some of the wisdom Micky shared with him (and that we've never seen before) as he prepared for his first fight with Apollo Creed. Burt Young gets to play Paulie as a drunkard again, Talia Shire (who seems particularly uninterested in playing Adrian again and doesn't seem to put much effort into the role) gets to yell 'Rocky!' one last time and she offers a couple more pep talks, and Rocky (after being somewhat more cultured in the last couple of movies) regresses to his almost incoherent form from the original. They all seem to be playing caricatures of once great characters. There's even a caricature of Don King, in the character of the evil promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant.)Anyway the storyline is a bit silly, but here goes. Rocky is brain damaged after his fight with the giant Russian in Rocky IV. (Rocky brain-damaged? Who'd have guessed it!) So he retires, but Duke has a particularly rude fighter named Union Cane (now there's a name for a fighter) who wants a shot at the title (shades of Clubber Lang here - I told you there wasn't much original to this.) But Rocky retires, ends up managing an up and comer named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) who then dumps Rocky because he gets tired of being seen as Rocky's protege (now did he really think that as an unknown being trained by an ex-champ he'd ever escape from Rocky's shadow?) and the two of them - well, if you can sit through it you'll find out what happens in one of the dumbest endings I've ever seen to a movie.A couple of problems with the story that really bugged. (1) OK, Rocky loses all his money because of a crooked accountant. I can see that. Paulie thinks he should do endorsements. Sounds right to me. He's a two-time heavyweight champion of the world, a hero to the 'common folk.' Who better to endorse various products? But his handlers say 'no.' Seems no company would want him as a spokesman because of a minor criminal conviction many years ago. But then his people argue for a return to the ring, based on his immense popularity. Huh? If he's so immensely popular why couldn't he get endorsements? That doesn't make sense to me. (2) After having to move back to the old neighbourhood, Rocky is worried that his son is going to be the target of toughs at his new school. A reasonable concern. So, to make him him seem really tough I guess, Rocky walks him to school the first day and in front of the school toughs calls out 'Daddy loves you.' (?) That's really going to help. And Rocky Jr. seems a bit too old for all the hugs and kisses dad gives him - my opinion anyway.Anyway, it's very sad to see how far the 'Rocky' franchise fell after an Oscar-winning beginning and two relatively entertaining sequels. This one gets 2/10, only because - as I said - it's marginally better than its horrible predecessor.",2,2,8,25 July 2002
Argo," Good And Very Suspenseful, But A Bit Lacking In Accuracy
","I appreciated that I did learn from this movie a lot of background to what is probably better known - here in Canada - as the Canadian Caper. 'Argo' is a depiction of the escape from Iran of 6 Americans who managed to avoid the hostage taking at the US Embassy in 1979 and made their way to shelter in the Canadian Embassy, later to be spirited out of the country posing as Canadians. Although I knew this event had happened, and I knew that there was substantial involvement by the CIA which went largely unacknowledged at the time, thus somewhat boosting Canada's role, I wasn't aware of the rather amusing backstory that was used by the CIA to pull off the operation - sending in an operative (Ben Affleck) posing as a Canadian movie maker looking for a shooting location, and setting up an entire movie production company to give credence to the story. I appreciated that background. And I give credit to the movie for being extremely suspenseful - especially in the last scenes at the Tehran Airport, as the Americans try to leave the country on a commercial flight while not blowing their cover as Canadians when being questioned by Iranian authorities. That was truly heart-pounding stuff. Unfortunately, it's also where the movie loses points with me: that was totally made up for dramatic purposes. The group actually sailed easily through the Tehran Airport without raising any suspicions, the plane was not chased down the airport runway by police. That was all made up. To me, that was an unfortunate way to end what had been a pretty good and accurate movie.It's true that while the Canadian involvement in the plot was deliberately overplayed at the time, the movie underplays the Canadian involvement. Basically, 'Argo' portrays the Canadian Embassy as little more than a motel for the 6 Americans, with Ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber) being a friendly innkeeper. There was more to Canada's involvement than that - the curious decision to have the US Government debating right up to the end whether to pay for the group's plane tickets being rather silly, for example, given that the tickets had already been purchased - by the Canadian government. (And, by the way, since the events happen in early 1980, the correct answer to the question 'who are the last three prime ministers of Canada?' isn't 'Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker,' it's 'Clark, Trudeau and Pearson' - Joe Clark was Prime Minister when this happened.)So, for heart-pounding drama, this is a very fine movie and it's worth watching for the look at the details involved in setting up the movie cover story. It just loses a little bit for some of the dramatic licence taken. (7/10)",7,2,4,27 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," This Just Seemed Off To Me - Really Off
","I love Star Trek. I've watched pretty much every television incarnation of it. Some I've enjoyed more than others, but I've watched them. I've seen all of the movies. I know Star Trek, in other words. This didn't seem like Star Trek. It was off; it was wrong. It was for the most part little more than a pretty standard action movie that tried to pass itself off as Star Trek by using the Star Trek characters. But it wasn't Star Trek. At best, there were times when it seemed to be almost a spoof of Star Trek. It wasn't something I could take seriously, and I'm not sure what those responsible for this movie were really thinking of and trying to accomplish. Frankly, I also can't figure out the title. Into what 'darkness'?I found the plot both pretty standard action fare, and also convoluted and lacking any real direction. There was no philosophical underpinning to this, which is often what made Star Trek worth watching. It's about a criminal/terrorist who attacks Star Fleet headquarters, with the Enterprise being sent off in pursuit, only to discover a massive bit of cover-up and corruption way up at the top. In the end, as the massive 'enemy ship' readies to collide with Star Fleet headquarters there's a certain 9/11 feel to this. Honestly - couldn't they have done something more original?Khan Noonian Singh? Again? Really? Yes, 'Space Seed' was one of the best episodes of the original 'Star Trek' TV series. Yes, 'Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan' was definitely one of the best of the Star Trek franchise of movies to date. But - Khan Noonian Singh? Again? Really? This is kind of the equivalent of 'Next Generation Trek' milking the Borg way too far for them to be either really interesting or really scary. And did we really need the bit of role reversal as the movie reached its 'climax' - with dialogue being lifted in some cases word for word from 'Star Trek II' but the roles of Spock and Kirk interchanged? That all just says to me that no one really put a great deal of thought into this. It was a muddle of things that are already very familiar thrown together (there's even a tribble in this!) with no particular coherence to them. And did we really need Leonard Nimoy? Again? I loved Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock. But - really - if you're going to try to keep this going (and there's another movie planned apparently, without J.J. Abrams directing) it's time to move on. You know. To boldly go where no one has gone before. Without Leonard Nimoy. Really. The whole Spock Prime thing serves no purpose whatsoever. Let Nimoy go. He's been honoured sufficiently.I've not much to say about the cast. The movie was so centred on action that the cast didn't stand out. They faded into the background behind the action itself and the special effects.I'll watch the next one. I mean, I watched 'Star Trek VI' even after the disaster that was 'Star Trek V.' But, please, make it better. Show some thought. Be creative. Do all the things that weren't done for this one. (3/10)",3,3,6,14 September 2013
Stripes," Starts Off Well, But Just Becomes Silly As It Goes On
","You look at the cast and you have to be impressed. Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Candy - throw in John Larroquette and Judge Reinhold and a couple of others. It's a good cast of SNL veterans and others who would become fairly well known. You look at the plot and you realize it's nothing particularly original. It's about a group of misfits in the Army. There are lots of similar type stories. But the cast draws you in, because you expect a fair bit from them. And for the first half of the movie they deliver reasonably well. The story revolves around John and Russell (played by Murray and Ramis) - who both find themselves in dead end jobs, going nowhere and decide that the Army looks like an easy gig. So they join up. And it turns out to be not so easy. That's one surprising thing about that fairly good first half - it's funny at times, but it also has its moments of seriousness and John and Russell discover that the Army isn't all fun and games. It was decent enough. But then came the second half of the movie. Something happens at the point of the platoon graduating from the military academy - especially when this joke of a platoon ends up being given responsibility for a top secret new military weapon. After that I thought 'Stripes' descended into silliness and started to take on almost a slapstick quality that just didn't appeal to me as much. It's not so much that I didn't find it believable - really, none of it is believable - but that it wasn't interesting and it stopped being fun.The female characters in this are mostly there for window dressing. Even the female leads (PJ Soles and Sean Young) don't have a lot to do and really can't be taken seriously - they play cute MPs who end up as playthings for John and Russell, although Young gets to do a wee bit more serious stuff in the latter stages of the film. But most of the women you see in this are for eye candy more than anything - there's a lot of toplessness but little substance.It's a middling sort of movie. I give it a 5/10.",5,1,2,22 August 2019
12 Angry Men," Simple Yet Powerful; Movie-Making At Its Finest
","Modern movies have convinced us that if a movie doesn't have big budget special effects and lots of action it's not worth watching. If you want to be healed of that viewpoint, '12 Angry Men' is the tonic. Here we have the simplest of movies. Except for the opening and closing couple of minutes this entire movie is set in a jury room, as 12 men debate the fate of a young man charged with murdering his father. Is he guilty or not? Will he be executed or not? The 12 jurors debate the case. And that's it, basically. And it's powerful and fascinating and you won't take your eye off the screen from the moment it starts.Henry Fonda put on an excellent (if, I thought, a little bit too preachy) performance as Juror Davis, the lone hold out as the movie starts, the vote being 11-1 in favour of guilty. Davis may not be convinced of the young man's innocence, but he sure isn't convinced of his guilt and he sets out to convince the others to give the kid a break. As good as Fonda was, though, Lee J. Cobb stole the show as Juror Number 3, an angry, hateful and vengeful man who lashes out at the 'bleeding hearts' as they start to be convinced by Davis' arguments. An excellent supporting cast (including the likes of E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden and Jack Klugman among others) also put on wonderful performances.I thought the movie was summed up perfectly at the very end. As Davis is leaving the courthouse, he's met by Juror McCardle (Joseph Sweeney). They introduce themselves to each other (they are the only two jurors named in the movie) and then go their separate ways. These twelve men who held the life of another man in their hands didn't have a clue who each other were and would probably never see each other again. But for this brief period of time they could hold us fixated, even if we didn't know who they were.Movie-making at its finest.10/10",10,0,1,28 January 2003
The Notebook," It's All About Love
","The best thing about 'The Notebook' is probably its simplicity. There's nothing complicated about it. It's all about the love shared by two very different people who have built a life together in spite of their differences, and who face their declining years together, with all the challenges those declining years bring. It's sweet, it's romantic, it's emotional (and, yes, at times it gets a bit too sappy) - it's probably the epitome of what we think of when we speak about a 'chick flick.' And it's very good. The premise is - as I said - surprisingly simple. Allie (Gena Rowlands) is confined to a nursing home because of dementia. She can't remember anything - not even her family. Her husband Noah (James Garner) is fiercely devoted to her, reading everyday from a notebook, in which Allie penned the story of their love, a story that just every now and then drags her back to reality. We move back and forth from the present day (in the nursing home) to the story of their early love. In their earlier days, Allie and Noah (played by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling) overcame lots of challenges and pretty long odds to be together. In their declining years, they have many things to overcome to stay together.It's a pleasant movie - sometimes sad, sometimes hopeful, and always passionate in a loving sense. McAdams and Gosling portrayed the young love brilliantly, but the most powerful scene (in my opinion) belonged to Garner, when - after a brief few minutes when Allie had snapped back to reality and they had shared a dance - is suddenly horrified by the fact that she lost everything in an instant and had to be restrained and drugged to be brought under control. It was the look on his face in that scene that stood out for me. The ending of the movie is both sad and happy, and completely appropriate to the story. In the end, the power of love triumphed in spite of all the odds against it. 7/10",7,0,3,31 May 2008
The Babadook," I'm Not At All Sure What Actually Happened - But I Liked It!
","The first thing that comes to mind looking back on this movie after watching it is that every time Bugsy appeared on the screen I winced. Bugsy was the family pet. A cute dog. And this is a horror movie. And you know what happens to cute dogs in horror movies. Anyway ...What a well crafted story this was. A young mother and her young son (Amelia and Samuel, played by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman) are dealing with his upcoming birthday, I say 'dealing with' because it's not a happy day for them. Samuel's father died on the very day Samuel was born, in a car crash getting his mother to the hospital. What becomes clear in the movie is that the father's death continues to torment both of them. As the movie starts, Samuel is a troubled child - unreasonably afraid of monsters (under the bed, in the closet and everywhere else) and with massive behavioural problems that make him unwelcome at school, unwelcome even by his aunt, friendless. He throws tantrums at the drop of a hat. And Amelia can't control him. One night he asks Amelia to read him a bed time story, and he picks a book called 'The Babadook.' Amelia doesn't know where it came from. It's bloody violent and graphic. And it unleashes something.That much I understood, but from that point on I became confused about what exactly was happening. But even if confused, I was admiring this movie. It's one of the better horror movies I've seen in recent years. It leaves a great deal to the imagination. It ends on a somewhat ambiguous note, letting the viewer interpret this in pretty much whatever way the viewer chooses. Was the Babadook real? Was it a figment of Amelia's imagination? I really don't know. What I do know is that this is a creepy and scary movie. What I also know is that Davis and Wiseman handled their roles very well, indeed. I especially appreciated the way they seemed to 'flip' about halfway through - with Samuel increasingly controlled and Amelia increasingly out of control. And in the midst of the horror' - you feel sympathy for both Amelia and Samuel, because of the husband/father's death, and how that affects how they feel about themselves and how they feel about each other and how others look at them and treat them. Regardless of whether the Babadook is real or not, they both obviously have their monsters to deal with, buried deep within them and coming out every year I would think as the 'birthday' approaches.I give credit to the writers and to director Jennifer Kent. Kent set a great tone and atmosphere throughout the movie, and the writers avoided making this any sort of graphic, slasher-type horror movie and instead focused on Amelia and Samuel and how they dealt with this terrifying situation. This is truly a fine addition to the horror genre. (9/10)",9,1,1,15 March 2018
Madagascar," Good Fun For Kids And Adults Alike
","There really aren't a lot of movies that can pull off the trick of entertaining both children and their parents, but 'Madagascar' qualifies as one of them. This story of four Central Park Zoo animals (Alex the lion, Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe and Gloria the hippo) who get accidentally stranded in the wild is an absolute delight. Marty, celebrating his 10th birthday at the zoo, dreams of life in the wild, whereas the other three are content with their spoiled existence as the centre of attention for the people who visit the zoo. All four get caught up in an outrageous scheme by the psychotic penguins to escape, and their adventure begins. They all discover that life in the wild has its ups and downs. The group are adopted by the local lemur community, led by the outrageous King Julian - as protectors against the 'foosa' - who appear to be hyenas. Things begin to go awry when Alex gets hungry and has very limited options to turn to to replace the steaks he loved in Central Park. It's a great deal of fun, offering some pokes at everything from 'Wild Kingdom' to 'Born Free' to 'Planet of the Apes' and several others. A lot of the story I think is over the heads of younger children, who also likely wouldn't recognize most of the stars who offer their voices to the various characters, but that didn't seem to bother my four year old daughter, who found the whole thing hilarious all the way through. 9/10",9,0,0,4 April 2009
The Other Boleyn Girl," Neither The Best Nor The Worst Of The Many Tudor Movies
","For a dynasty that only lasted a little over a century (although in that relatively short span of time it produced 5 monarchs - or 6, if you count Jane Grey - including two of the greatest in Henry VIII and Elizabeth I) the Tudors have had a disproportionate impact on both history and Hollywood. 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is the latest in the Tudor-inspired collection of films. It's not the best of the bunch (I'd personally give that place to 'Lady Jane') but it's also not the worst. It features an excellent performance from Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn and also from Scarlett Johansson as her younger sister Mary. Yes, it perhaps has too much of a soap opera type feel to it (although that tends to be the way we regard the British monarchy today as well) but it is interesting and I thought it portrayed a believable account of the complicated relationship between the two Boleyn girls as they competed for the attention and love of Henry VIII, played by Eric Bana, who I thought failed to nail that part as well as he could have, but who wasn't bad. I also thought that Ana Torrant gave a pretty good performance as Henry's first Queen, the unfortunate Catharine of Aragon.The reconstruction of 16th century England (in the sets and the costumes) was well done, while some of the dialogue was, frankly, less than engrossing. To modern eyes, the most unsettling thing about the movie might be the way in which the Boleyn girls were used as pawns by their own father and uncle - knowingly sent off to the royal court to be sexual playthings for the king (even though Mary was already married) - in order to gain the family favour and status. Even having said that, it's difficult to feel too much sympathy for them - especially for Anne, who is portrayed as a master manipulator who would willingly sell out anyone to fulfill her dream of becoming England's Queen. As I said, this is neither the best nor the worst 'Tudor movie' you'll find, but it is a decent enough movie - not a masterpiece, but worth a couple of hours to see it through. 6/10",6,0,0,26 January 2009
Bloody Sunday," A Chaotic Movie About A Chaotic Event
","'Bloody Sunday' is a movie that might be best described as chaotic - which is surely not inappropriate for any movie dealing with the tragedies of Northern Ireland and in particular with the events of January 30, 1972 in Derry. This TV production was filmed in a quasi- documentary style, which perhaps added a touch of reality to what was happening but which, to me, also failed to engage. It largely follows the efforts of the Irish Catholic Member of Parliament Ivan Cooper to organize a peaceful protest march through the streets of Derry, only to be forcibly confronted by the British military. Cooper seems to have modelled his 'Civil Rights Association' after figures who were noted for non-violence - particularly Ghandi and Martin Luther King, Jr. There's absolutely no doubt here that the movie takes sides - it's pro-Irish Catholic and anti-British Army. I don't know that I'd go so far as to declare it pro-IRA, though. The IRA doesn't actually get mentioned very often, the emphasis being on the contrast between the desire of the protesters for a peaceful march and the apparent over-reaction of British troops. The movie is far more interesting in its second half, once the confrontation begins. The lead up to the confrontation really didn't capture me all that much, but the events of the actual confrontation were realistically and graphically recreated.I suppose that now (in 2010) before one falls into the trap of declaring this pro-IRA (or at least anti-British) propaganda, one has to take into account the results of the Saville Inquiry, which were made public in June 2010 and led to an apology from David Cameron - the British Prime Minister - in response. The closing captions of the movie certainly make clear that the sympathies of the producers were with the protesters.I didn't consider this to be a great production, but it certainly gives a hint of what feelings were like in Northern Ireland in those troubled times, and it raises a lot of unsettling questions about the use of violence and what it accomplishes.",3,4,10,23 December 2010
Elizabeth," Marginally Better Than 'The Golden Age'
","I've watched the two 'Elizabeth' movies out of order, having seen the sequel 'The Golden Age' a couple of years ago, and only now the original 'Elizabeth.' 'The Golden Age' came across to me as too romanticized. This one was definitely (if only marginally) better. Beginning with the Roman Catholic Queen Mary (Elizabeth's half-sister) on the throne, and the Protestant Princess Elizabeth being a rallying point for English Protestants, the movie offers a very good portrayal of the religious fervour of the age, as we see Protestants being burned at the stake almost from the opening scene, and it accurately notes that Elizabeth was in many ways a moderate in the debate: Protestant, but not too Protestant; quite willing to let Catholics (and also Protestant non-conformists) alone as long as they attended Church of England services as well as their own. There was a lot of intrigue portrayed as Elizabeth comes to power after Mary's death and as she begins to consolidate her hold on power, which was at first quite shaky and uncertain. There was also a lot of attention to a pre-eminent diplomatic issue of the day: who should Elizabeth marry? There were candidates from both France and Spain (and England for that matter.) The issue of her marriage did lead to one of the funniest scenes in the movie, when Elizabeth walks in unexpectedly on one of her suitors (the French Duc d'Anjou) and discovers him - shall we say - dressed as a woman in the company of men at what appeared to be a rather raunchy party. All that was well done.The same weaknesses that held back 'The Golden Age' in my view are still here, though. The flow was missing; the movie seemed to jump around too much, and the relationship between Elizabeth and Robert Dudley depicted more of the unsubstantiated gossip about how intimate their relationship was, when, in fact, many suspect that stories of their intimacy were quite exaggerated.Still, this is not a bad movie. It's a great period piece; authentically 16th century in look and feel, and Cate Blanchett is fantastic as Elizabeth - her appearance at the end of the movie is the spitting image of the typical Elizabethan portraits.",6,0,0,24 August 2010
Billy Elliot," Surprisingly Good
","How interesting could a movie about a boy who gives up boxing to become a ballet dancer be? Actually, the answer is - very! This took me by surprise. It's well acted and well written, and presents an interesting look not just at Billy's (Jamie Bell) struggle to succeed in ballet but also a good historical overview of the Coal Miner's strike during the Thatcher era from the perspective of an affected family (Billy's.) Billy's widowed father Gary Lewis and brother Jamie Draven are striking miners, and neither are interested in having a ballet dancing 'puff' in the family. We get to watch their attitudes change, however, as both realize that ballet could be Billy's ticket out of the wretched life they've been forced to lead.This truly was a pleasure to watch. (One warning for North American viewers, though - the accents are at times a bit thick and hard to follow.)8/10",8,1,1,3 June 2002
127 Hours," A Powerful One Man Performance From James Franco
","Clearly, James Franco's performance as Aron Ralston is the highlight of this movie. Franco is basically putting on a one-man show for probably 90% of the running time and he (and director Danny Boyle) manage to keep the story flowing effortlessly, and draw the viewer into the nightmare that Ralston has literally fallen into. Ralston is a rock climber who makes the tragic mistake of going climbing alone without telling anyone where he would be going. A fall into a deep crevice traps his arm against a canyon wall and the movie is the account of Ralston's fight to survive, based on the book that he wrote about this experience. In that sense, there's no real mystery about what the outcome will be - the movie is based on Ralston's own book, and acknowledges that off the top. Obviously he survives. The question is how. Franco brilliantly portrays Ralston's growing desperation (which begins more as frustration as he assumes that he'll find a way out but gradually realizes that getting out is going to be a lot more difficult than he at first thought.) As his food and water run out and as he battles insects and cold nights and comes to terms with his life and some of the mistakes he's made you get drawn into his situation. Even if you've never read the book, you basically know how this situation is going to be resolved but that doesn't take away from the movie's power. In some respects I might compare this to the movies 'Alive' or 'World Trade Centre' - each of which deal with somewhat similar circumstances of people trapped in nightmarish situations wondering how they're going to get out. The difference here is the one-man nature of the story.In addition to Franco's performance, the on location filming offers starkly beautiful pictures of the canyon environment. From a strictly personal perspective (and this is merely a matter of taste I suppose) I didn't care for much of the musical score (especially the opening music) and I'm not really a big fan of split screens, which occur periodically throughout this. Overall, though, from the simple perspective of the story (which is, of course, what really counts) I'd say this is a must see.",8,0,2,27 January 2011
Finding Nemo," A Fun Underwater Adventure
","'Finding Nemo' is a very well done movie for the whole family. Technically, it has the high quality of animation that Disney/Pixar are famous for, but what it also had was another feature Disney is famous for that hasn't always been clear in some of its more recent work - it's real, and at times sad and tragic, and doesn't get lost in the idea that children should somehow be shielded from the reality that sometimes bad things happen. In an opening that reminded me a bit of Bambi's mom being killed, when clownfish Marlin loses his mate Coral and most of his babies in an attack from a predator you knew that this was not going to be just a silly cartoon. In the aftermath of the attack, Marlin is left to raise his only surviving child Nemo by himself. Not surprisingly, he becomes over-protective, Nemo becomes resentful and in the end Nemo is captured by divers and ends up living in a tank in a dentist's office while his dad desperately tries to find him and rescue him. This runs the whole range of emotions - it's happy, it's sad, it's funny (the sharks who belong to the AA-type group - 'fish are friends, not food' - are hilarious) and in its own way it's very educational for young ones, as the animation really does give them a sense of what some of these creatures look like. Ironically, probably the worst animation (at least in the sense of not looking anywhere close to real) was of the humans who periodically appear in the movie. Clearly, another winner for Disney/Pixar. 8/10",8,0,1,12 October 2009
Creed," It Has Little But Nostalgia Going For It
","Boxers over the years have had a notoriously hard time figuring out when it's time to hang up the gloves and quit. They keep coming back, and it gets to the point of being pathetic as you watch once magnificent fighters fade away into shadows of what they were. Think Muhammad Ali. Or Larry Holmes. Or Sugar Ray Leonard. Or Evander Holyfield. All once great fighters who just couldn't let it go. Sylvester Stallone is, of course, an actor and not a boxer. But his most iconic role is Rocky Balboa - a boxer. And as I watched this movie (actually not much more than a few minutes into it) I started to think that Stallone was a little bit like Ali or Holmes or Leonard or Holyfield. He should have just let Rocky go. I rather liked 'Rocky Balboa' - what I thought would have been the last film in the series. I thought it was a decent film, and a good way of tying things up. But almost 10 years later, Stallone had to do it again. And the result was Ali-like, or Leonard-like. Etc., etc.The great thing about the Rocky movies was that you couldn't help but root for Rocky. Whether the movie was good or bad (and the series had both) you always rooted for Rocky. He was everyone's ultimate fantasy - the down and out guy with no prospects who gets to live his dream and makes good at it. But in 'Creed' you don't get that. I didn't much care for Adonis Creed - Apollo's son (in a convoluted sort of way that I really didn't understand, probably because I just didn't care enough to keep it straight in my head.) The character didn't resonate with me. Win. Lose. I didn't care. What I couldn't figure out was why Rocky bothered with him. The basic story is that Adonis makes good after a troubled childhood, apparently has a pretty good job that he suddenly quits to become a fighter. (And who, exactly was Phylicia Rashad - who played Apollo's widow - to him anyway? And why did she care all that much?) He searches out Rocky, convinces Rocky to train him - and then everything comes pretty easy for him actually. But the character just didn't resonate with me; I had no feelings for him whatsoever. When you mix that in with a story that seemed to be lacking in direction or flow you end up with a movie that just bores you. And that's what happened to me. I struggled through it (I admit I may have lost the battle and nodded off for 5 or 10 minutes about halfway through, but I can't imagine I missed anything of vital importance) but it wasn't an enjoyable experience.I know there was a bit of Oscar controversy. Stallone got nominated for Best Supporting Actor. And, in this year when charges of racism were levelled at the Academy, people wanted to know why, if Stallone got nominated, Michael B. Jordan didn't get a Best Actor nomination. Truthfully? Neither should have been nominated, nor should the movie have been, although I heard some folk speculate that it might get a Best Picture nomination - which it didn't. The movie just wasn't that good. The performances weren't that good. Stallone can play Rocky. We know that. And he plays Rocky well. But he's done it so often that nothing here would have stretched him at all. Perhaps more should have been done with Rocky's battle with cancer - but that was never really developed very much. Stallone's nomination was about honouring Stallone, and not about honouring his performance in this particular movie. And Jordan just didn't have whatever it takes to draw me onside with him. Best Actor? Even just a nomination? I don't think so.I will admit that this movie has nostalgia going for it. Lots and lots of nostalgia. It's as if the producers (and there's too many of them to list!) realized that neither the story nor the characters would be a draw, so they went with nostalgia. 'Creed' pays homage to various aspects of previous 'Rocky' movies. Adonis is a sort of Rocky-type character. (Please promise me that they're not going to start a series of Creed movies. PLEASE!) Rocky visits the graves of Paulie and Adrian. He gives Adonis the Adrian speech from 'Rocky III' - 'you have to do this for you!' There's Mickey's gym, and Rocky comes across a bit like Mickey - having Adonis chase chickens around to build up speed. There's lots of nostalgia. But there's not much more worthwhile.",3,6,13,8 March 2016
The Great Dictator," Brilliant Piece of Anti-Nazi Propaganda
","Written, produced and directed by Charlie Chaplin, this is the great actor's anti-Nazi propaganda piece, skewering Adolf Hitler.Chaplin plays Adenoid Hynckel, the dictator of Tomania, as well as  a Jewish barber who is Hynckel's spitting image. His parody of Hitler is brilliant. Anyone who has ever seen newsreels of Hitler speaking will recognize the eerie resemblance of the caricature. I thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical Chaplin slap-stick focussing on the First World War adventures of the Jewish barber. Having never seen it before I must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so I was wondering what all the fuss was about. But the movie picks up steam quickly. There are some very funny moments, and enough emphasis on the anti-Jewish nature of 'Hynckel-ism' to make the propaganda point. The climax of the film is a brilliant anti-Nazi speech given by Chaplin at the end of the movie.As good as Chaplin is in this movie, though, I thought the whole thing was stolen by Jack Oakie, playing the dictator of 'Bacteria' - 'Benzino Napaloni.' Our first look at Oakie shows how well he had studied his subject - he had Mussolini's arrogant posturing down pat. The scenes in which Hynckel and Napaloni negotiate over the fate of 'Osterlich' had me in stitches.This was a very good movie, and well worth watching.",7,2,6,8 February 2001
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Predictable With A Few Laughs Throw In Along The Way
","I had heard good things about this movie. 'Hilarious,' I was told. Well, not quite. It has a few chuckles along the way but for the most part I thought this was a pretty routine account of two people having to overcome obstacles to fall in love, etc., etc. Nothing really unique in the premise, in other words. Kate Hudson plays 'Andie,' a woman's magazine columnist who is writing a column about the mistakes women make in dating and is getting her material by picking out a guy, getting him to fall for her and then making all the mistakes to drive him away. Unknown to her, though, the guy she meets - 'Ben,' played by Matthew McConaughey - also has an agenda. He's an ad executive who makes a bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in ten days, and if he does, he gains a huge advertising contract. (Is it believable that an ad agency of any credibility would assign a contract that way?) So you have Ben and Andie working at cross-purposes. She's falling for him but has to drive him away; he's being driven nuts by her but can't let her go. And so it goes.It is amusing at times (sometimes downright funny, in fact.) But the whole premise of two people lying to each other had a rather nasty, mean-spirited feeling to it, which really comes out at the party when everything is discovered. Surprisingly, I found it a little bit dark as comedies go and just wasn't able to let myself enjoy it perhaps as much as some others have. That having been said, Hudson and McConaughey were absolutely perfectly cast for their roles. They were believable, and there was a real chemistry between the two of them which gave the movie a more realistic feel. But it really didn't leap out at me as I know it has some others. And with an ending that you see coming before you even start watching the movie (is there anyone who doesn't know how these funny romantic movies are going to turn out?) there really isn't any fun in the end; the only fun is the road you take to get there and that, I thought, had a few potholes along the way.Largely on the strength of Hudson and McConaughey, this movie gets a 6/10.",6,1,2,10 August 2003
The Mummy," An Interesting If Flawed Remake That's Marginally Better Than The Original
","It's taken me 13 years to watch this movie because, basically, I didn't like the original version! Of all the 'classic' Universal horror movies, I thought 1932's 'The Mummy' was the weakest. Aside from a great performance by Boris Karloff, it just wasn't that good. Universal knew how to make good horror movies, but what they so often did so right, they so totally failed at with 'The Mummy.' It wasn't exciting, it wasn't fun and it wasn't frightening. A horror movie, to be a horror movie, has to have at least one of those three things going for it. And, since remakes generally aren't as good as the original, I avoided this one like the plague until now. I'm pleasantly surprised, in that I actually thought this was marginally better than the 1932 version.What went wrong in 1932 did not go wrong in 1999. This movie was exciting - it was packed with action and had some great effects. This movie was fun - it had a tongue in cheek quality to it, and the performances (especially from leads Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) captured that tongue in cheek quality perfectly. And, at times at least, it was frightening. At least Imhotep was a ghastly, frightening being - not at all like the Imhotep of the original, who could have walked down the streets of Cairo with no one knowing who he was or thinking there was anything strange about him! So a lot of the problems were fixed, and made this pleasant watching.It was not, however, without problems. Essentially, it went a bit overboard. In particular, the last half hour - featuring all of Imhotep's mummified and dessicated but re-animated priests was a little bit ridiculous, and I have to confess that the point at which they appeared was the point at which my attention started to wander. The opening, which featured a helpful journey back to ancient Egypt and explained how Imhotep got into this position, was also perhaps a wee bit too long, but it didn't cause me to wander. Those mummified priests in the last half hour didn't work for me.When the last half hour of a movie causes you to lose a bit of interest - that's a problem. Overall, I enjoyed this, and I did think it marginally better than the original. For the 1932 version, I awarded a 5. Since this is - in my opinion - marginally better - 6/10.",6,0,4,27 November 2012
The Others," Ghost Story With An All Too Predictable Twist
","This is ranked in the top 250 on IMdB? Does it gain this ranking on the basis of Nicole Kidman's dull performance or because of the completely predictable plot twist that I had figured out well before the halfway point of the movie?Well, others are entitled to their opinions, of course, but I found it difficult to keep at this one. It was a pretty routine ghost story in many ways (except for the predictable plot twist that I won't describe because trying to figure it out might be the only thing that would make this worthwhile for some folks) which means that since the genre has been done to death (no pun intended) it wasn't particularly frightening, unless strange noises from upstairs, and piano playing when no one's at the piano and doors slamming into Nicole Kidman's face frighten you.Ho hum is the best way to describe this effort, which (I'm feeling generous) I'll give a 4/10.",4,1,2,16 June 2002
Rise of the Guardians," Chock Full Of Messages And A Few Cutesy Moments
","I get the message from this, or, maybe I should say the messages. There's more than one. There's the power of belief and the importance of believing. Then there's the heartache of being the one who blends in and never gets noticed. Little children can make a big difference. I get all that, and they're fine messages. And yet, with all those fine messages packed in, I thought this was at best a very average movie; not one that captivated me.It uses a variety of legendary beings (including Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the Sand Man) and turn them into super-hero sorts, whose role as 'Guardians' is to protect little children. But the source of their power is the belief of the children, and if the children stop believing, then the Guardians are helpless. Into the mix at the beginning of the movie comes Jack Frost. We don't know where he comes from. He just rises out of a frozen pond as the movie starts; a boy without a past called - to something. He finds his purpose (and his past) when the Boogey Man shows up to wreak havoc and to destroy the belief of the world's children, and we end up with a titanic battle between Jack Frost and the Boogey Man to climax the movie, with the other Guardians and the world's children playing supporting roles in the battle.It was OK. In addition to the good messages there were the requisite 'cutesy' moments - most revolving around Santa's somewhat gnome-like elves, but also around the Easter Bunny when he's reduced to a mere baby. Jack's past (when it's finally revealed) is also rather sad and at the same time, strangely, happy. This didn't really captivate me, and it won't qualify as a classic to me.

Brokeback Mountain," Good Performances In A Movie That Picks Up Speed As It Goes Along
","Brokeback Mountain is based on a short story by Ann Proulx, who also wrote the novel 'The Shipping News' - which became, of course, a very successful motion picture in its own right. Although the two stories have little in common, knowing that made it difficult for me not to make some comparisons. My reaction to the 'The Shipping News' was that it came across to me as completely pointless. To be honest, my reaction to the first hour or so of 'Brokeback Mountain' was essentially the same. Two cowboys go up a mountain and fall in love. OK. The rather out of the ordinary nature of their romance creates some awkwardness for them, but still this didn't seem to be accomplishing very much or really moving anywhere. To be honest, it wasn't even that courageous. Look at the popular media these days. Homosexuality is not exactly a taboo subject anymore. Twenty years ago, this movie might have been courageous. Today, it needs more than supposed controversy to make it worth watching, and it didn't have much more than that for at least half of its run time. About halfway through, though, the pace of the movie picked up noticeably, and there were several very powerful scenes contained in that last hour: Ennis (Heath Ledger) being confronted by his ex-wife, who clearly knows that he and his buddy weren't doing much fishing on those fishing trips; Jack (Jake Gyllenhall) taking on his father in law over a family dinner; discovering Jack's fate, and the visit by Ennis to Jack's parents - these were all very well done and suddenly seemed to give me the feel that this movie had some sort of purpose - dealing with the troubles that arise when love appears in unexpected places. As a corollary to that point, I couldn't help feeling the most sympathy for the wives of Ennis and Jack. Both guys seemed to positively revel in their opportunities to betray their marriage vows.Ledger and Gyllenhall are very good in their roles, and their characters are very different. Jack comes across as essentially a homosexual trying to manage in a straight marriage, whereas Ennis seems to be basically straight but consumed by his inexplicable feelings for this one man. Both were worth watching.I said that I found myself comparing this to 'The Shipping News.' It is - in my opinion - better than 'The Shipping News,' but is still dragged down by an opening half that didn't seem to want to go anywhere. A strong second half and good lead performances get this a 5/10.",5,2,16,16 April 2008
Orphan," This Turns Out To Be Surprisingly Exciting
","This movie is certainly not a good commercial to promote the adoption of older children! I know that for that very reason it sparked a bit of negative comment from the 'adoption community' for exploiting that angle. Having said that - as a member of that community, I can't see any reason that this particular subject matter should be declared off limits to Hollywood. The only issue for me as someone who watched this is whether or not it's a good movie. In fact, it is. It's well constructed, and moves the viewer logically but unpredictably toward a very violent and climactic ending, with a twist that was completely unforeseen. By the last 20 minutes or so, this actually had me on the edge of my seat.As the adoptive parents, Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard were effective - Farmiga moreso, I thought. Sarsgaard's character came across as a bit of a dunce, quite frankly, and I wasn't especially sympathetic toward him. That's not Sarsgaard's fault, of course. He played the character that was written. It's just that Farmiga as the embattled mom Kate was the one who garners the sympathy and concern of the viewer, and I wondered throughout how she was going to avoid taking the blame for everything that was happening. In the end, though, the performance that stands out is neither of those. It's young Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther, the adoptee who ends up destroying the family. Fuhrman was absolutely brilliant - especially considering her age and lack of experience.Fuhrman's performance aside, what I appreciated was the way director Jaume Collet-Serra kept building the suspense. Just when you think you know what's going on, there's another twist. At first, my expectation was that this was going to be some sort of supernatural 'spawn of the devil' sort of film, and had very low expectations. Then it seemed to settle in as being little more than a story about a child raised in a Russian orphanage with all the assorted problems that can create. Then it seemed to become a psychological thriller, as Esther starts to seem less like a well-adjusted child and more like a truly insane and depraved child. Then there's the final twist that I won't reveal but that truly did shock me. After that revelation, though, the movie does become extremely violent - although given what we learn about Esther's background, the violence is to be expected. Overall, this is excellent. A movie that keeps me on my toes with twists and turns and leaves me on the edge of my seat has done something very right!",8,2,3,17 April 2010
Spotlight," A Powerful Story That Will Anger Those Who Watch It
","This is a difficult movie to watch - a movie that will make you truly angry, even if you aren't Catholic. It details the work of a group of investigative reporters with the Boston Globe in the late 1990's and early 2000's to expose the sexual abuse scandals of the Roman Catholic Church in Boston. Now, today, we hear so much about the sexual abuse of minors by priests that I fear we've become hardened to it. It doesn't seem to shock us anymore. But at that time most of this was unknown to most people - covered up by Church officials who just kept moving pedophile priests from parish to parish and settling with abuse victims out of court to protect the image of the church; used by lawyers who presumably made a comfortable living off the negotiated settlements; swept under the carpet by officials ranging from police officers to judges who turned their eyes away because they were Catholic themselves; ignored or minimized by the media when stories did leak out. It's a story about an out of control institution and the power of the Roman Catholic Church - not a wild eyed conspiracy type of story, but a raw, down to earth story about what was (and is) essentially a conspiracy to try to get the Church off the hook for the abuse committed by its clergy. This is a powerful story that makes you shake your head in disgust and contempt.The movie opens with a brief account of an abused boy in 1976, and a visit by Cardinal Bernard Law to his family to work something out so that nothing goes public. So we're exposed right away to the fact that the Church cared more about itself and its reputation than about its victims. Then we jump into the story of the journalistic investigation. The strong suggestion of the movie is that none of this might have come out except for the fact that in early 2001 the Globe hired a new editor - Marty Baron (played by Liev Schrieber.) Baron was not from Boston. Baron was not Catholic. Baron was not Christian - he was Jewish. Basically, he had no stake in covering this up and so he demanded that his investigative team plow ahead with its work, with the goal being not just to find individual cases of abuse but to find out what the systemic problem was and how far up the hierarchy it went. Michael Keaton played the head of the 'Spotlight' team - a team of Globe reporters who work solely on investigative journalism - ably supported by Mark Ruffalo, Brian D'Arcy James and Rachel McAdams as the team. The performances were superb, but this movie really isn't about the performances. It's about the story itself. You really didn't need well known names for this - the story drives the movie forward, as the scandal grows and grows - cover up after cover up. From a handful of priests involved to 13, to 90 all the way up the hierarchy of the archdiocese itself until it finally reaches the door of Cardinal Law himself (played by Len Cariou.) Many of the victims are found and interviewed. Some of their stories, while not incredibly graphic, are still sickening. And the movie ends with a huge list of places in the United States and around the world where sex abuse scandals have hit the Roman Catholic Church.The story proceeds both slowly and deliberately - and provides a fair bit of detail into the investigation. In that sense it's also an interesting look at investigative journalism. But in the end it leaves you angry. I am a Christian and I am clergy - not Roman Catholic but Protestant and married with a daughter, but this still hits home even if I'm not part of that tradition. It is horrifying and outrageous. The abuse of the trust that parents placed in these priests only to have that trust abused in the worst possible way is shocking. I firmly believe that the vast majority of Roman Catholic priests are fine and faithful men who do not and would never abuse children. And the problem of abuse of trust is not restricted to the Roman Catholic Church by any means. But this story and the many, many scandals that have erupted since do point to a systemic problem in the Roman Catholic Church that seems to be out of control, and a larger than would be expected number of pedophiles within the priesthood.It is truly difficult to find anything much to criticize about this. It's a first rate, well done movie that sadly remains entirely relevant and will probably remain relevant for some time to come. (10/10)",10,1,1,2 September 2018
Insomnia," Robin Williams Out Of Character In A Movie With Too Many Flaws
","I had been intrigued by this movie from the time it first appeared, largely because I was curious to see how well Robin Williams would handle a straight dramatic role. Simply put, he was all right, but the movie itself was rather weak and uninspired.The first thing I wondered about was the premise. A teenage girl is murdered in a place called Nightmute, Alaska, and the local police department there calls upon the LAPD for assistance, who end up sending two detectives to help out - Dormer (Al Pacino) and Eckhardt (Martin Donovan). They have no detectives in Alaska? I mean I'm sure that murder isn't especially common up there but they had no one who could help? The cities of Anchorage or Juneau wouldn't have had a detective who knew something about  murder investigations? I just thought that whole idea was problematic.Second problem was the characters themselves. Frankly speaking, there wasn't a single likeable character in the whole movie. There was no one to root for. There was killer Finch (Williams), irritating hero-worshiping local Alaska cop Ellie (Hilary Swank) - no wonder they had to go out of state - corrupt Dormer (Pacino) and his squealing partner Eckhardt (Donovan.) Is there anyone here to feel sympathy with? NO!Third problem was the storyline revolving around the title. Yes, Pacino has the right look for a guy who's gone 6 days without sleep. But so what? The movie would have worked just as well if Dormer had been well rested, but we have to have this story about how it's hard to sleep when one first goes to Alaska in the summer because the sun is always up. OK. That's exciting.Anything good about this movie? Well, the opening musical score was quite good and really drew me in (until the movie actually started anyway); it sets the tone quite well for a suspense cop thriller. Problem is there's not a lot of suspense or thrills coming up. And Williams came across well in this very out of character role for him. Unfortunately, it just isn't a very good movie.3/10",3,7,17,5 December 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," A Great Ride!
","Much has been made of the scientific impossibility of the very premise of this movie: climate change happens incrementally, not suddenly as it's portrayed here. Point made, I suppose, but those who make this criticism forget the basic point involved in making a movie: you want to entertain the viewers. While this may be scientifically inaccurate, it's an amazing ride. (And, for those concerned with the inaccuracy of sudden climate change, it's worth noting that the scientists portrayed in this movie also conceded that this shouldn't be happening this fast. That was part of the mystery to it all.) From start to finish, this film has everything a good movie needs: action, real suspense, good if not spectacular performances and absolutely amazing special effects. I thought the movie weakened a bit in the second half, as the focus shifted away from the mystery involved in the climate change and took on a fairly predictable rescue format. It also came across as a bit preachy at times; with barely disguised shots at governments about the failure to really take action on global warming. (Did I also detect a shot at the Bush administration? Perry King and Kenneth Welsh as the President and Vice President respectively bore something of a physical resemblance - I thought - to Bush/Cheney, and in this movie it was rather clear that the Vice President was calling the shots.) The movie could have been cut a bit in the last 45 minutes or so. In particular, the wolf scene on the ship struck me as unnecessary and somewhat tedious.Still, this was an entertaining movie that kept going all the way through, even if it was slowing down just a bit by the end. 7/10.",7,1,2,1 January 2005
Yes Man," The Power Of 'Yes'
","In all honesty Jim Carrey sometimes grates on me. He's funny, but far too often his humour becomes too over the top and his characters become cartoons rather than real people. When he keeps that to a minimum, though, he can work very well, and he managed to pull that balance off with 'Yes Man.' Of the Carrey movies I've seen I'd probably compare this most to 'Bruce Almighty' - not in terms of plot but in terms of the type of character he was playing and the challenges the character was facing. In this, Carrey played Carl Allen, a loan officer at a bank who leads a pretty empty, lonely and unproductive life. One day, a buddy convinces him to attend a self-help seminar, where he learns to start living life by saying 'yes' to every opportunity that comes up. Terrence Stamp, by the way, was absolutely bang-on as the self-help guru.Thanks to the power of 'yes' Carl's life moves into overdrive. Suddenly he's involved with everything and everyone: from guitar lessons, flying lessons and Korean lessons to a new job as an executive to a new love - and he's loving his life. Finally, though, his new love interest, played by Zooey Deschanel, reminds him of reality. She tells him that she loves him and asks him to move in with her. Of course he says 'yes,' but when she finds out about the program she backs out - does he really want to or is he just following the program? Can she believe a word he says to her? The key to the movie in the end is whether Carl can learn to really live his own life rather than just being enslaved to the program that originally seemed to have given him freedom.It's an interesting premise for a movie, very well written and well acted, and, in the end, both thought-provoking and a lot of fun. 7/10",7,2,2,23 October 2009
Midnight in Paris," When Dreams Meet Reality
","I should not have liked this movie. Everything in me screams not to like it, and has prevented me from actually watching it until now - Academy Award nominations notwithstanding. I don't really care very much for Woody Allen's movies. His work too often seems to be a reflection of his own quirks and neuroses, and the result is that I find myself being irritated by him rather than admiring his work. And, to be honest, I don't really care much for Owen Wilson as an actor. I find it hard for some reason to take him seriously. He strikes me as lightweight and flaky, lacking in depth, not altogether present in many of his roles. And yet, in 'Midnight In Paris,' Allen as director and Wilson as star work wonderfully together. Allen does a grand job of recreating Paris in primarily two (but actually as many as four in the course of the movie) eras. Paris comes across not only as a city of lights, but as a city of dreams. It captivates; it draws. And Wilson fits the story perfectly.He plays Gil Pender, an American screenwriter but really an aspiring novelist. He's visiting Paris with his fiancé Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. Gil and Inez don't work together. That's clear from the start. Why they're together is a bit of a mystery. He likes walking through Paris in the rain; she just wants to stay dry - maybe a reflection of the difficult match between a dreamer and someone with no imagination? Her parents don't care for him - they seem to think he's beneath her; so does she to be honest. There's an aristocratic snobbishness about them that Gil doesn't share. He wants to write; he dreams of living in the past, when Paris was a haven for writers and artists of various sorts. When Inez and Gil meet up with Paul & Carol (old friends of Inez, whom Gil admits he's not really taken with) I really felt myself drawn to Gil. He was the target of repeated putdowns by the 'pedantic' (that's the word that was very appropriately used) arrogance of Paul, who's a self-proclaimed expert on everything. As Inez is more and more drawn to Paul's snooty intellectualism, Gil is more and more drawn away from her, and begins to wander Paris late at night, when he is suddenly and inexplicably transported into the Paris of the 1920's - his idea of the golden age - where he meets famous writers and artists - Hemingway, Stein, Fitzgerald, Picasso and Dali among others. He's increasingly drawn to this life and this age, and especially to Adriana (Marion Cotillard) and returns night after night.The movie is a nostalgia trip, and yet it's a nostalgia trip that has a purpose. You see, as much as I don't like to admit it, Paul was right when he said, 'nostalgia is denial - denial of the painful present... the name for this denial is golden age thinking - the erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one one's living in - it's a flaw in the romantic imagination of those people who find it difficult to cope with the present.' Nostalgia is a form of denial. You really can't escape the present with all its problems, no matter how hard you try. Gil has to come to understand that. His life isn't what he wants it to be; the people around him aren't the people he wants around him. He needs to come to terms with that. One of the great insights he discovers through his growing relationship with Adriana is that while she lives in the 1920's - his golden age - she has a golden age that's in the 1890's. Through that, he finally realizes that he has to live in the present because no matter where he goes in the past, there will always be a golden age to look back to and to yearn for, so unless he can learn to be satisfied with where and when he is, he can never be truly satisfied. The journey of self- discovery is an interesting and enjoyable and thought-provoking one.Allen made one mistake. It was around the detective hired by Inez's father to find out what Gil was doing at night. Without giving it away, the ultimate fate of the detective (who's a very minor character) seemed out of place - an unnecessary and far too deliberate and obvious attempt to draw a laugh out of the viewer; so obvious that it drew no laugh from me. I just wondered why the scene was included. It served no purpose. I'm not entirely sure why Allen included that scene. It weakened the movie, and coming near the end, it stays in the memory of the viewer. Aside from that one scene, though, this was a very good movie. Certainly one of the most enjoyable movies made by Woody Allen that I've ever seen. (8/10)",8,0,0,12 April 2012
Zodiac," A Well Done Account Of The Search For A Serial Killer
","What we have here is a story based on the facts of the Zodiac murders in California in the late 60's/early 70's. Knowing that this was the background of it (although I wasn't actually familiar with the story of this particular serial killer) I found that this movie was a surprise in many ways. My first expectation was that it was going to be more explicitly about the Zodiac killings. In fact the killings themselves weren't really the centre of the story. Some of them were depicted, and there was some blood involved, but David Fincher, who directed this, avoided the temptation to make this a slasher-type thriller. This may sound strange, but the depictions of the murders - to the extent that they were depicted - I thought were rather tastefully done and avoided excessive gore. The movie then seemed to focus around the investigation into the killings, but even that turned out not to be the real point of the movie. Really, it became a movie about the obsession of various people to figure out who the killer was, and how it took over their lives.Jake Gyllenhaal was brilliant as Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist for the San Fransisco Chronicle who starts up a friendship with reporter Paul Avery (a nice performance from Robert Downey, Jr.) who is the lead reporter on the killings.Avery's obsession with the case leads to a series of problems which eventually leave him out of a job, while Graysmith becomes even more obsessed, sacrificing his job and his family to eventually write a book about the killings. On the police side of things, Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi also finds his life being taken over by this investigation, while the only one in the movie who eventually escapes from this and moves on with his life is Inspector Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards).As the movie progresses from killer thriller to crime drama to a study of obsession, I found myself becoming increasingly drawn into it. There's more than enough hints at the possibility of various rather creepy people who may have committed the murders, and in the end it all points to one suspect in particular, but the murders remain officially unsolved, and the prime suspect is now dead.I thought the movie might have been a little bit shorter than it was ( it clocks in at 2:37) but aside from that this is a very well done story that keeps you thinking and keeps you guessing. 8/10",8,1,4,25 January 2008
Milk," It's More Than A Bio-Pic
","As a biography of Harvey Milk, this movie works very well. Milk, of course, was the first openly gay man elected to public office in the United States when he won a seat on the San Fransisco Board of Supervisor in the mid 1970's. Aside from those two facts, I really knew nothing else about Milk, and appreciated the look at his life and career. Whatever one's perspective on homosexuality and the gay rights movement is, one can't deny that Milk, by his political activism on behalf of the gay community, changed the face of society and encouraged a growing tolerance (at first) and then finally a growing acceptance of homosexuality as normal. Since the gay rights movement and the homosexuality community is now a significant political and even religious force, that alone makes Milk someone we should probably know more about. I appreciated Sean Penn's portrayal of the man. Penn seemed to grasp the character well, and offered a convincing portrayal, and we learn a lot in this movie about Milk the man - his life, his relationships, his politics. It's a worthwhile look at the man.What makes the movie even more worthwhile, though, is that it serves as so much more than just a biography of Harvey Milk. Director Gus Van Sant very skilfully managed to weave the evolution of the gay rights movement in the 70's into the life of Milk. The two became inseparable. As the movie starts in 1970, Milk is an in the closet insurance salesman in New York City, at a time when gays in general were closeted, harassed and even despised. The Anita Bryant controversy plays a significant part in the first half of the movie as a reminder of those times. Eventually moving to San Fransisco with his new partner Scott, Milk comes out of the closet and becomes a leader of the gay community, finally being elected on his third attempt at office. His life clearly serves as a symbol of the growing visibility and influence of the movement in general.Aside from Milk, the primary character in many ways is that of Dan White (played by Josh Brolin.) White was a 'family values' type, elected as a Supervisor at the same time as Milk. The two form an uneasy partnership on some issues which eventually falls apart. Eventually, White became mentally unstable and, as history and the movie record, assassinated both Mayor George Moscone and Milk.Most civil rights movies, of course, focus on the struggle for the rights of African Americans in the 50's and 60's. Will this movie start a trend toward movies depicting the battle for civil rights for the gay community? Only time will tell, but it is a very interesting movie about an interesting man and an important movement. 8/10",8,0,2,26 October 2009
The Prestige," It Had Its Moments
","I found the most interesting part of this movie to be the behind the scenes look at some of the tricks used by illusionists and magicians. The broader story has great potential. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival illusionists in late 19th century London, whose rivalry goes beyond just a fun competition and becomes dangerously obsessive with ultimately tragic results. All that sounds pretty good, and both Jackman and Bale were solid in their roles as Angier and Borden respectively, as was Michael Caine as Cutter, Angeirs' assistant. Spoiling the story somewhat for me was a sort of mini-subplot about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. Edison is never depicted in the movie, while Tesla is played by David Bowie of all people. That rivalry was very real of course but dissolves into a bit of a farce here, as Tesla has supposedly invented some sort of teleportation device that Angier wants to use in his show. A simple and obsessive rivalry would have been quite sufficient without that dive into sci-fi silliness. I also have to say that while the movie certainly had its strong points, for the most part the story just didn't take hold of me. I found it a little long and slow-paced at times, and in the last 15-20 minutes there just seemed to be too many twists and turns happening, which again took away from the story's credibility. In the end, my reaction was that this was OK, but nothing more. 5/10",5,15,31,23 June 2009
Cloverfield," It Has Ups And Downs But Mostly Ups
","Cloverfield surely has to rank as one of the better 'monster' movies made in a long time. It's filmed in a style reminiscent of 'The Blair Witch Project' - one of the characters has a hand held camera and records the unbelievable events surrounding an attack on New York by a huge, somewhat dinosaur looking monster (although we never really get a clear look at it) that somehow drops little 'mini-monsters' that create their own havoc. The film is then supposedly discovered by the government after the event. The weakest part of the movie, I thought, was the opening 20 minutes or so, focused on a party being given for one of the characters who's moving to Japan. To be honest, I found that whole thing a bore (and some of the rather unimportant material introduced in that opening kept seeping into the rest of the movie unfortunately) but once the monster is introduced (by way of what seemed to be a sort of earthquake that rattled everything and even made me jump) it becomes a very entertaining and at times rather frightening movie. It's at times confusing - and deliberately so, since it's attempting to draw you into the absolute chaos and terror that has suddenly engulfed this group of people. There's an eerie resemblance here to scenes of 9/11, with buildings collapsing and clouds of dust choking everything and papers flying through the air. Overall, it's very well done, definitely draws you in after that slow start and maintains the atmosphere of panic all the way through. 7/10",7,0,0,14 November 2008
Sleepy Hollow," More Of A Murder Mystery Than A Horror Movie - And A Pretty Good One
","Being totally unfamiliar with the original story by Washington Irving (all that I knew about it was the obvious fact that it featured a headless horseman) I waded into this movie with no preconceived notions and no expectations of what was going to happen. The end result was a pretty enjoyable ghost story. Johnny Depp seemed perfectly cast here as Ichabod Crane - the New York City policeman (sort of a Sherlock Holmes-type) who gets sent to the sleepy village of Sleepy Hollow in 1799 to help investigate a series of murders in which the victims' heads have been cut off and never found. It was a typical quirky sort of role for Depp, who's teamed again with director Tim Burton. Crane wades straight into the legend of a Hessian soldier beheaded during the Revolution who now haunts Sleepy Hollow until his head is returned to him. The mystery is around who he chooses to kill and why he chooses them.That mystery is pretty well put together, although a bit confusing at times, and while it does all make perfect sense in the end, I had absolutely no idea who the person responsible for the horseman's killings was going to be. I did make a guess and it turned out to be wrong. As always, Tim Burton puts together a perfect blend of story and atmosphere that makes the movie very realistic to watch, and the special effects are very well done. Although the murders are graphically depicted, they're not especially bloody considering that they feature beheadings (especially compared to, say, the bloody gore of Burton's 'Sweeney Todd,' which also featured Depp) and I would tend to call this a murder mystery rather than a horror movie as it's suspenseful rather than frightening. Enjoyable though it was, I found there was a period in the middle when the story seemed to lose its hold on me and I had to force myself to concentrate on it, and I'm not really sure why. I also thought Crane's arrival in Sleepy Hollow - an isolated 18th century town in which most everyone is related to everyone (a point made later in the movie) was accepted a bit too nonchalantly, given that he was a complete stranger, and small towns - even today - tend to view strangers (especially city folk) with some sense of suspicion. That may be considered by some to be an unimportant detail, but I did notice it, and it caused me to question the story's credibility from the start. Still, it's a pretty good piece of work by all involved.",7,0,0,14 March 2009
Hotel Rwanda," A Million Corpses
","By the time this movie ends, you really have no choice but to sit back and take a deep breath as you process the insanity of the fact that this really happened. A million corpses. That's the note this movie ends on, in estimating the carnage caused in Rwanda as a result of the Hutu slaughter of Tutsis in the early 1990's. 'Hotel Rwanda' offers just one glimpse into the madness - but a soberingly powerful glimpse.Don Cheadle is brilliant as Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a Belgian owned hotel in the capital of Kigali, who is left in charge when the Europeans leave and finds himself the sole protector of what would become hundreds of desperate Tutsis, who find shelter in the hotel. Paul is a Hutu who is married to a Tutsi, and who is horrified by the escalating violence. Sophie Okonedo is equally brilliant as Paul's wife Tatiana, under threat for being a Tutsi, her children under threat, her brother and his family missing in the midst of the chaos. You get drawn into this family's nightmare, but the movie never becomes solely about them. It's always about the insanity, and the complete failure of the international community to do anything about it. From that point of view, Nick Nolte plays Col. Oliver, a Canadian officer in command of far too few UN peacekeepers, who knows what's happening but is powerless to stop it. Oliver is essentially a representation of Canadian General Romeo Dallaire, who was the UN Commander in Rwanda at the time. Nolte wasn't as brilliant as Cheadle or Okonedo. I thought he struggled a bit with the part, although he drew out the character's frustration and anger at the UN's impotence.The movie reminded me a bit of 'Schindler's List' - particularly as Paul bargained with Hutu officers for the lives of Tutsis, just as Schindler bargained with Nazis for the lives of Jews. The first hour or so I thought was a bit slow, although director Terry George built the suspense nicely, and one of the more interesting parts of the movie came in that first hour with an explanation of the difference between Hutus and Tutsis. It apparently isn't a traditional tribal designation. The Belgian colonizers divided the natives into these two groups, based on the lightness of their skin and the wideness of their noses! There's no happy ending in this movie. There is a family reunion of sorts (a partial one, anyway) but the haunting memory for me was that closing caption - 'a million corpses.' Even after writing all this, the more I think about it, the more I wonder - how do you do justice to a movie like this in a short review? 9/10",9,0,0,21 October 2008
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," I Was Bored Almost From Start To Finish
","Yes, this gets off to a somewhat promising start, with the shooting of the intelligence agent in Budapest. Yes, there's an attempt to keep the viewer interested as we try to untangle the mystery of who the mole is. Yes, there's a Russian agent high up in British Intelligence. The problem is that between the shooting and the revelation of the mole's identity, there's very little here that holds your attention. It's an unfair stereotype I know, but this movie fits the stereotypes of Brits perfectly (and I'm of British descent, so ...) - dull, staid, not especially emotional, rather deliberate and always quite proper. The problem is that the stereotype doesn't make for a good movie. There's uninspiring dialogue, a story that meanders just too much and loses you in the process, and - to be honest - not a single performance in this really stood out to me as outstanding, or even as notable, making Gary Oldman's Oscar nomination for Best Actor inexplicable.This also goes down as one of those annual mysteries about why certain movies receive Best Picture nominations. I can only assume that because they have to nominate so many now, a few duds are inevitably going to slip through. This was one. (2/10)",2,1,4,6 February 2012
The Hateful Eight," What A Truly Awful Movie
","Count me among those who really, really disliked this movie. In general, I've had extreme reactions to Quentin Tarantino's work. Either I've really loved it, or ... well .. I really haven't. 'The Hateful Eight' definitely counts among the latter group. I suppose one should give credit for the title at least. 'The Hateful Eight' sums up my feelings about the characters perfectly. There's not a single one among them who I like; not a single one I would trust to look after a nickel for me. But they're also really not amusing or interesting. There's just nothing appealing about any of them. Which means that you get stuck sitting through almost 3 excruciating hours with them. At one point it seemed this movie had gone on forever, but then I checked and discovered there was still almost an hour to go. My Lord, it was painful. It does eventually seem to establish some sort of direction or purpose relatively late when we start dealing with the murder mystery - but in all honesty by the time that happened I was struggling to stay awake and just waiting for the torutre to end. It was truly a painful experience watching this. (1/10)",1,2,8,1 December 2019
Gettysburg," Long, But Worth The Effort Of Watching
","A very interesting take on the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, which is unfortunately marred by its excessive length (well over four hours), which could easily have been cut by at least an hour if unnecessary marching scenes were cut out. (I timed one point in the movie when a full six minutes went by showing nothing but troops marching. This was absolutely tedious!)There isn't much 'drama' involved in this. How can there be? Everyone knows the Battle of Gettysburg, we all know that the North won, and serious students of the Civil War know most of the military manoeuvres that were used, as well as the fates of the major combatants. So, it was up to the director (Ronald F. Maxwell) and the various actors to give us something of a unique spin to hold our attention through the long story. For the most part, they were successful.I was quite intrigued by Martin Sheen's portrayal of General Robert E. Lee. Lee comes across almost in a mystical way - a man of vision and courage, and yet also very human. The debates between Lee and General James Longstreet (played by Tom Berenger) over strategy were realistic, and the fact that Longstreet was proved for the most part to be right demonstrate the fact that Lee - while a great General - was subject to human failings as well. Sheen portrays a Lee who is coming to terms with his hero status among his troops, but also shows him subtly uncomfortable with it.Also interesting was the constant hearkening back to the pre-war relationship between Union general Winfield Hancock (Brian Mallon) and Confederate General Lewis Armistead (Richard Jordan). Good friends before the war (almost brothers, as both describe the relationship) they now find themselves on opposite sides of this great battle, wanting to see each other because they are friends and yet not wanting to see each other as enemies. Tears well up in both as they speak to fellow officers about the relationship. A believable portrayal of how many Americans must have felt in this conflict which divided friends and families.Most interesting of all, though, was the portrayal of General Joshua Chamberlain (by Jeff Daniels), the colonel of the 20th Maine Infantry. I was only vaguely familiar with Chamberlain when I first saw this movie, and was motivated by it to become more familiar with a truly fascinating individual. Hardly a classic soldier (he was a university professor of English and Religion back in Maine) Chamberlain displays a solid grasp of tactics, and comes across as the great Northern hero in this account of Gettysburg.So, there are a lot of good things in this movie. Don't let the length of over four hours put you off. Although there are a few tedious scenes (such as the marching scene I described earlier) it's worth hanging in through them to get a very realistic and largely historically accurate picture of perhaps the greatest battle of the US Civil War.6/10",6,34,48,1 November 2001
"I, Tonya"," A Story Populated Solely By Boobs
","As you're watching this the truth is that you honestly don't know whether you should be laughing or crying. It's the life story of Tonya Harding - the infamous American figure skater who ended up being banned from skating and with a criminal record after the attack on her fellow skater and American teammate Nancy Kerrigan in the lead up to the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. Written by Steven Rogers and directed by Craig Gillespie, this is a combination of biography and dark (very dark) comedy with some very sad dramatic content mixed in. I have to admit that as I waded my way through it, it brought up conflicting emotions within me. There are times when Tonya becomes very much an object of sympathy. Her upbringing is portrayed in nightmar-ish quality. I would rarely if ever use this term, but her family of origin (and especially her mother) are shown as the showcase of redneck white trash. Her mother is domineering, angry and shows no love for her daughter - except, mind you, that she does seem to spend most of the money she earns as a waitress on figure skating lessons for Tonya. But then, at the rink, she's the quintessential ugly sports parent - attacking her daughter, Tonya's coach, Tonya's competitors; foul mouthed, pushy. It was an incredible performance from Allison Janney, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Perhaps not surprisingly, Tonya then ends up marrying Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) - who's portrayed as an abusive guy who's none too bright. Tonya's life is a nightmare. She contributes to it, of course, rather than rising above it - and by not being either able or willing to rise above it she puts herself at odds with the US figure skating establishment, who don't like her because she's almost the complete opposite of the elegant and beautiful Nancy Kerrigan.And there it is - 'the incident' as the movie refers to it; the attack on Kerrigan as her knee is smashed not long before Lillehammer in an attempt (unsuccessful) to knock her out of the Olympics. 'The incident' is what every viewer is interested in; it's the only reason you'd even really know who Tonya Harding is. The incident itself only takes up a few seconds of screen time - but there's a lot of focus on the planning and on the aftermath. It becomes like something you'd see in the Three Stooges. Tonya is jealous of Nancy. Jeff decides the make anonymous threats to Nancy to play with her head. But he can't do it himself, so he enlists the help of his buddy Shawn Eckardt (a great performance from Paul Walter Hauser) - who imagines himself as some sort of secret agent/counter terrorism expert, but who's really not much more than a loser who lives with his parents and his fantasies. In this portrayal of events it seems to be Eckardt who pushes things too far. As you watched all this unfolding on the screen, you wonder how seriously you can take any of it. Often the characters come across more as caricatures than anything - it is, in the words of Hard Copy reporter Martin Maddox (Bobby Cannavale) 'a story populated entirely by boobs.' True enough. Entirely. You do feel some sympathy for Tonya, as I said, but in the end none of these people are anywhere near likeable.Tonya was played by Margot Robbie. It was a strong performance, and Robbie was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar. She was, in fact, very good in the role - she played that redneck white trash completely believably. I have to give a lot of credit to director Craig Gillespie and whoever was responsible for choreographing the figure skating scenes. They were incredibly believable and authentic. I'm not sure that the format of the movie was entirely successful. It's told essentially as a series of snippets of interviews of the various characters, followed up by more traditional dramatic presentations of what was being talked about. I think that perhaps a straight movie format without the interviews might have worked better, although the portrayals of the interviews certainly gave us some feel for the various people depicted in the film.I'm not sure that in the end I felt sorry for Tonya herself - nor do I think the movie was really going for sympathy. It does, however, give you an understanding of her background and upbringing and helps you gain some sense into how she ended up where she was, and you have a sort of grudging admiration just for the fact that she got as far as she did, and even for the fact that she was so resistant to conforming to the standards expected of a figure skater. But that admiration is linked with a sense of tragedy at the absolute waste of talent that her life ultimately represented, and at what she was ultimately reduced to as portrayed by the last little bit of the film.

We Were Soldiers," The Human Side Of This Is What Makes It Work So Well
","The depiction this film offers of the Battle of La Drang (the first major battle fought by the United States in Vietnam) is brilliant. It's so well re-enacted and so graphic that it truly does give the viewer a taste (but only a taste) of the insanity and sheer violence of war. It's a taste. I was comfortably sitting in my living room watching this. I don't claim to have been able to fully (or even remotely) understand what the soldiers in the midst of the battle were feeling. But it is a taste. Well done, and very sobering. It has to be one of the best battle re-enactments I've ever seen in a movie. As well done as it was, though, it wasn't the depiction of the battle that made this work. One gets desensitized after a while. The sheer scale of the carnage being depicted is overwhelming and from time to time my mind just left the screen as if I needed a break from it. So if this had been all about the battle it wouldn't have been nearly as effective as it was. What made this work was the very effective interweaving of so many very human elements to the story above and beyond just the depiction of the battle. These were, indeed, soldiers, but they were more than soldiers. They were real people, with wives and children and friends back home. Real people with lives that went far beyond what they did on the battlefield. Real people that we cared about because we learned of their lives and of how much reason they had to live and of how tragic it was that so many of them died.The human elements of the story were shown in many ways. Although sometimes long introductions to a story bother me, I appreciated the somewhat lengthy introduction to this movie. After a brief look at the French experience in Vietnam, the movie shifts to a U.S. Army base where a new division is being put together to go to Vietnam and engage the enemy. We see the unit being formed. We meet the men - more importantly, we meet their families. It was a great way of drawing us into their stories; of reminding us that these were real life flesh and blood men, and not just destined to be battlefield casualty statistics. Later, after deployment and as the battle heats up, we're drawn into the anguish of the families as telegrams are delivered, telling wives that their husbands had been killed - telegrams originally delivered by taxi cab drivers because the Army wasn't ready with chaplains, until the wife of the commanding officer takes over the job of going door to door to break the news. I was impressed by the depiction of the North Vietnamese. They weren't depicted as evil; they weren't caricatured. They were the enemy - but only because this was war. They were soldiers, too - with people who loved them; a point brilliantly made by the use of one Vietnamese soldiers' notebook (eventually picked up by the Americans) that contained a picture of his sweetheart. And, in the end, the movie is clearly shown to be not about war, but about the relationship between the men, as we see Col. Moore's anguish at the loss of so many soldiers and his relief at returning home, and as the point is made that these men didn't fight so much for their country - they fought more for each other.Mel Gibson I thought pulled off the role of Col. Moore quite well: fiercely devoted to his men, and as commander of the 7th Cavalry determined to avoid the fate that had befallen the commander and troops of a previous 7th Cavalry - Custer at the Little Big Horn. That was an interesting connection that was made several times in the movie. This is a very good war movie, made even better by the fact that it's about more than war - it's about the people who fought and lived and died together, and about the people back home who loved them.

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A Lot Of Good Things In It, But Overall I Just Didn't Find It That Interesting
","Overall I have to confess that in spite of its very high rating this movie didn't really strike a chord with me. It's partly the genre I suppose. I've just never been much into Westerns. Horses and gunfights and saloons have never been of much appeal. Beyond that, though, I simply didn't find the story here to be particularly interesting, nor did I find the movie to be as much fun as a lot of people think it is. I can't give a movie that I don't find interesting a particularly high rating or much of a positive endorsement. Having said all that, though, I do want to acknowledge that it's just my personal bias, and that there's a lot about this movie that I liked in spite of the fact that when it was all put together it didn't appeal to me that much. So, let me offer the positives.First I appreciated the honesty right off the top. There really was a 'Hole in the Wall Gang' and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were real figures in the Old West as a part of it. The movie follows the basic outline of their life - early bank and train robberies, the escape to Bolivia and the relationship with Etta (Katharine Ross) are all based on reality. But the movie was honest. Instead of saying 'Based on actual events,' I loved that the opening caption was 'Most of this is true' - thus acknowledging dramatic licence in a way that most 'based on actual events' movies don't do. I liked the pairing of Paul Newman (Butch) and Robert Redford (Sundance). They worked very well together and offered pretty good performances in the title roles. The movie did a good job of creating some tension as Butch and Sundance were being pursued by a mysterious posse. The question that kept being asked by Butch ('Who are these guys anyway?') hung in the air quite well. There were a handful of amusing scenes - especially the train robberies involving Woodcock (George Furth) which I enjoyed. A sense of fun was also created by the use (only once, mind you) of the song 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head.' In one sense, that song seems totally out of sync with the movie, but the scene in which it was used, in which Butch takes Etta for a ride on a bicycle, was a silly, fun scene, and a silly, fun song fit that scene, if not the overall feel of the movie, quite well.But for as much as I liked all that, what I have to keep coming back to is that I just didn't really find the movie to be all that interesting. Just a personal opinion and reaction. Obviously most people disagree with me. (4/10)",4,5,10,31 December 2011
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Dr. Strangelove and Fail Safe - Two Sides Of The Same Coin
","The obvious movie to compare this to is 'Fail Safe' - made at about the same time and dealing with essentially the same scenario  an accidental nuclear bombing mission by American jets over the Soviet Union - that no one seems able to stop. The difference between the two, of course, is that while 'Fail Safe' was deadly serious, 'Dr. Strangelove' is a black comedy  and a wonderful one, beautifully developed all the way through by director Stanley Kubrick. In fact, the thing that made this so funny was how realistic everything seemed. As you watch the events transpire, you find yourself asking the question 'why couldn't this happen' - and it's not easy to come up with an answer.Sterling Hayden plays General Jack Ripper, commanding officer of a U.S. Air Force Base who goes insane, becomes convinced of a Communist conspiracy (after all, fluoride was introduced into drinking water in 1946  it must be a Communist conspiracy) and takes it upon himself to issue orders to his pilots to nuke Russia. Meanwhile, his second-in-command Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, a British officer on an exchange (played by Peter Sellers, who also plays the title character, as well as the U.S. President) realizes that Ripper is insane and tries to find a way out of the mess. Back in Washington, Gen. Turgidson (George C. Scott), who commands the Air Force, sort of sums up the whole mood of the movie when he reflects on why current policy won't allow any way to recall the bombers: 'don't let one little slip up' - even when that 'one little slip up' is the nuclear bombing of the Soviet Union! - 'ruin the whole program!' There's a lot of good comedy here. I loved some of the conversations between the U.S. President and the Soviet leader ('Dimitri, turn the music down, I can't hear you'), thought the emergency rations given to the place crews (including prophylactics and nylons) were a scream and it was hilarious to watch as Mandrake is trying to get in touch with the President to explain what's been happening but can't get through because the only phone he can find is a pay phone and he doesn't have the right change. Interestingly, in addition to the comedy, there's a good build-up of suspense as well.The title of the movie is interesting, because Strangelove (a German apparently brought into the service of the U.S. After World War II) actually only appears in 2 or 3 scenes, but Sellers manages an over the top performance with him when given the opportunity, replete with Nazi salutes and references to the President as 'Mein Fuhrer!' I would rate this as one of Sellers' best performances. In fact there isn't much of anything to dislike here (although to be honest I found Slim Pickens a bit irritating as Major Kong, the pilot of the plane trying to bomb Russia.) Otherwise, this was great. 8/10",8,1,3,2 December 2007
The Beach," A Disaster From Start To Finish
","Leonardo DiCaprio successfully sheds his 'Titanic' image in this account of a young American tourist who stumbles upon an idyllic island paradise while on vacation in Thailand, only to discover that paradise ain't all that it's supposed to be. Unfortunately, the same can be said for this movie. It's terrible in almost every respect.The premise is hardly unique. For years the idea of discovering paradise only to be disappointed with what you find has been the theme of novels, stage plays, movies. The closest analogy for this movie might be that it's kind of a 'Lord Of The Flies' with adult characters. But the really surprising thing is that such a well-worked plot could be burdened with such an absolutely incoherent story line, which repeatedly falls into ridiculous and juvenile silliness. And the ending makes no sense at all. Why in the world would the 'dope farmers,' who have already demonstrated that they are willing to kill to prevent more people from coming to their island, then simply pack the inhabitants of the village up and send them back to civilization? Now there's a good way to keep the island a secret! Certainly one wouldn't expect originality in this kind of story, perhaps, but it should still be interesting! Trust me, it's not!The movie features some good photography and beautiful scenery - which barely manages to raise it from a 1 to a 2 in my books. Aside from that, 'The Beach' is a monotonous disaster all the way through. Do not waste your time on it. You will regret your decision.",2,2,5,24 February 2001
The Expendables," An Action Movie For Action Fans
","Without any hesitation at all, I have to say that this is a must see movie for any fan of action movies. It has action in abundance from beginning to end - everything from blazing shootouts to martial arts. For the most part it's a lot of fun, and often moves into overdrive in the action scenes. It even features what I thought was a decent enough performance from Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross (a name you have to love for this kind of character) who's the leader of a band of apparently special ops mercenaries. Stallone also directed to no great note, but the point of the movie was the action, which is well done. The whole thing opens with the team taking on a group of Somali pirates and leads up to a huge and frankly overdone battle between the team and a group of soldiers they've been hired to do battle with on a Caribbean island. That last battle was overlong to the point of tedious, going on for about 20 minutes with hardly a word of dialogue. That was fun for a few minutes but it should have ended a lot sooner than it did.The story was strange. The team was supposedly hired to take out this Caribbean dictator and possibly the Americans who fund him. In the end, though (and actually pretty early on) the movie became a 'save the girl' story as Barney sets out to rescue the dictator's daughter, who's actually opposed to her father and gets captured and tortured by his soldiers. That seemed to be the wrong direction to take. The movie should have perhaps held its focus on the battle against the evil dictator.It's fun from an action perspective, an even features a couple of notable and uncredited cameos at the beginning from Bruce Willis as the guy who hires the team and from Arnold Schwarzenegger as a potential rival who loses out on the job. You have to love Stallone's line as Schwarzenegger walks away after losing out on the job: 'he wants to be president.' It's enjoyable enough and definitely action-packed. It didn't have enough of a consistent storyline for my liking, but real action fans will love it.",5,1,6,9 February 2011
Scary Movie 2," Not Worthy Of Its Predecessor
","I loved 'Scary Movie.' It was so absolutely stupid it was hilarious. I still laugh whenever I see it, and I had been so looking forward to an opportunity to see this next installment. My advice to all of you: don't tarnish your memories of the first with this abysmal sequel.One accepts that by the very nature of the series as a parody the story will be stupid, the acting deliberately bad and the humour silly. That was the case with the first movie, but in the first movie it was funny; it worked. Here, it's lost its edge. That's the problem with parodies. It's hard to do them more than once and keep them funny. This reminds me a bit of the 'Airplane' movies spoofing airline disasters. The first one was great, after that - why bother? Now, sometimes the parody format can work in a sequel. I'm thinking of the 'Naked Gun' movies or 'Austin Powers.' But 'Scary Movie 2' doesn't cut it as a worthy sequel. I'm not sure that I even broke a smile the entire way through. While most of the cast is back (including Anna Faris as Cindy, around whom the sequel also focuses), I have to say that I really missed the character of 'Doofy' from the original, and there was no one in this cast to really fill the hole that was left. And this movie needed something to recapture the fun of the first.2/10",2,0,1,7 September 2002
MASH," Vastly Over-Rated
","I realize that this movie has achieved almost cult status and is widely regarded as a classic, but it just didn't work for me. The best thing I can say about it is that it gave birth to the long running television series of the same name, which may still be the best television series ever made. But how anyone could watch this movie and get the idea to make it into a television series is beyond me.I readily confess, of course, that (as with almost everyone born in the 1960's or later) my introduction to and conception of MASH is the TV series. It's truly difficult for me to relate to Donald Sutherland as Hawkeye Pierce, for example. Not that he, or any of the actors, did a bad job. It's just that the TV series is so ingrained in my mind that it's hard to see different actors putting their unique spins on familiar characters. Hawkeye, Trapper John (Elliott Gould), Frank Burns (Robert Duvall), Hot Lips Houlihan (Sally Kellerman) and Col. Blake (Roger Bowen) are portrayed very differently than their TV counter-parts. That's fine (and the actors did well) but it's still disconcerting.The problems I felt with this movie went far beyond the difficulties involved with relating to an unfamiliar cast playing familiar characters, though. The story focuses on the experiences of Captains Pierce and Duke Forrest (Tom Skerritt) at the 4077 MASH in the Korean War. It opens with their arrival and closes with their discharge. But to me the movie lacks any clear focus or consistency. It doesn't seem to be building to anything and in the end it just fizzles out quietly without any real climax. The zany antics of the doctors come across here as mean-spirited more than fun, and there's way too much emphasis on the football game between the 4077 and the 325th Evac. I mean - who really cares? To me, this movie didn't even seem to have a strong anti-war message. Anti-military perhaps, but not anti-war (and the two are not the same thing, in my opinion.)I realize that I'm not in tune here with most people's thinking, but as far as I'm concerned the best thing about this movie is actually hearing the words to the familiar MASH theme: 'Suicide Is Painless.' I also appreciated the fact that, this being a motion picture rather than a TV series, the horrors of war (ie, the wounds of the soldiers) could be more graphically (and therefore more soberingly) portrayed. Aside from that, nothing much here appealed to me.2/10",2,42,77,20 January 2003
Alien," Tense More Than Frightening
","Director Ridley Scott does a great job in this sci-fi classic of building suspense without resorting to much in terms of blood and gore or the normal sci-fi staple of futuristic weapons, etc., with much of the suspense being built by the wise decision to have the movie focus (the title notwithstanding) not on the alien, but on the crew of the Nostromo, a space freighter that investigates a signal it picks up that leads it to a hellish planet where it picks up an uninvited guest. The movie starts slowly. It gives the viewer a feel for the crew and who they are and the relationships that exist between them. Once on the planet, the atmosphere becomes one of mystery and then, with the introduction of the alien, it takes on that tense atmosphere that permeates most of the story.Scott makes good use of the settings - the surface of the planet and then especially the dark and somewhat claustrophobic atmosphere of the bowels of the Nostromo, where the crew begins its search for the creature that's starting to pick them off one by one. We never really get a great look at the alien. It exists mostly in the shadows or in brief and partial shots, which adds to the mystery. The sense of hopelessness is palpable - this alien appears to be a perfect predator with no obvious weakness or vulnerability. The performances were good. The star of the movie is clearly Sigourney Weaver. This was a very early role for her, and she handled being the star quite well, backed up by a number of familiar faces such as Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright and Harry Dean Stanton - none of them huge mega-stars, but a solid enough cast. Although I liked the way this movie was put together and enjoyed its atmosphere very much, I'm not sure there was enough in it to compel me to seek out the sequels, because I don't really see where the sequels could go except into a more traditional human vs. alien battle.",7,0,3,25 January 2011
The Book Thief," One Of The Most Powerful Endings I've Ever Seen
","For most of its runtime, my general feeling was that The Book Thief was a good movie - a definitely interesting movie that looked at World War II and Nazi Germany from a different perspective. In this case, we see everything that happens mostly through the eyes and experiences of Liesl. As the movie opens, Liesl is on her way to live with adoptive parents. Her mother has been taken away as a communist, and her brother dies along the way, leaving Liesl to face an uncertain future on her own. As she cautiously bonds with her new parents (played by Emily Watson and Geoffrey Rush) we see first the outbreak of anti-semitism with a brief look at the events of Krystallnacht, and then the outbreak of the war. Interspersed are some looks at everyday life in the Third Reich, including the decision of Liesl's parents to offer shelter to a Jew, and you get some idea of how the children especially were brainwashed by Nazi propaganda. Mind you, aside from a lot of looks at swastika flags, I thought Nazism was surprisingly underplayed in this; the Nazis and the state apparatus being present but generally more in the background than front and centre. All very interesting, and certainly worth watching, but no more than that. And then came ... the ending.Well, the last few scenes really. It began with the bombing of the street Liesl lived on. Everyone she cared about, and everyone who cared for her was killed. She survived only because she had fallen asleep in her basement. It was literally heartwrenching. Then an equally heartwrenching reunion, as Max - the Jew her adoptive parents had sheltered - returns to her after the war. And then, the story of Liesl's long and finally happy life - all narrated by death itself. To that point, I wasn't taken with the decision to use death as the narrator (in keeping with the novel on which this is based.) But death is actually a very effective narrator at the end, making a lot of wise and philosophical observations about the human condition. The ending of this movie is truly superb.Also superb was Sophie Nelisse, who played Liesl. She did a magnificent job of portraying Liesl gradually growing up and maturing. Those who did her makeup and costumes were equally superb. The changes in her appearance as the years went by were noticeable but subtle. Very realistic, in other words.I give this an 8/10. The last 15 minutes or so is a perfect 10, though.",8,1,4,21 June 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Not Your Average Musical!
","The movie opens with what I can only describe as a classic Tim Burton style, as the camera zooms through the streets of Old London. With such a Burton 'signature' you have to know that you're in for something of an unusual movie - and you get it. This is, in fact, a very odd combination of things. It's a musical about a demonic mass-murdering barber and somehow in the midst of it all it also has a few scenes that are actually quite funny - for humour I think right off of Mrs. Lovett's 'The Worst Pies In London' near the start of the movie. Johnny Depp as the 'demon barber' Sweeney Todd and Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett are excellent and performed well together, and the supporting performances were probably topped by Timothy Spall's go as the Beadle. The story of Todd's quest for murderous revenge against the judge who stole his young wife from him years before moves along pretty nicely (although I have to admit that it took some effort for me to get through the first few scenes for some reason) and most of the songs are well performed. As for weaknesses, it seemed obvious to me for some reason who the old lady who kept popping up was, so that came as no particular surprise to me and in all honesty I thought Burton went a bit overboard with the bloodiness of the murder scenes - although it is Tim Burton we're talking about. There was also that strangely off putting (to me) opening couple of scenes that failed to pull me in, although in the end I'm glad I stuck with this. For the most part it was a lot of fun. 7/10",7,0,0,15 November 2008
Horrible Bosses," Very Crude But Often Amusing
","Who hasn't had a job at some point in their lives which has included a horrible boss you'd rather just be rid of? That's the basic premise of 'Horrible Bosses,' in which three guys (Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis) decide they're fed up with their bosses (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell) and decide to kill them, the only problem being that they don't have a clue how to go about doing that, so they hire a guy (Jamie Foxx, whose character's name is so crude that it probably can't even be included) to do it, except that he turns out to only want to advise them how to do it because his prison time was for illegally recording a movie in a theatre! If it sounds crazy, it is. It's a wild ride.It's an extremely crude movie. Obscenities and sexual innuendo run rampant through the whole thing (surprisingly, perhaps, since actors like Bateman and Aniston generally have a more 'wholesome' image.) To be honest I didn't buy Aniston in the role of the nymphomaniac dentist Julia, who's out to bed her dental assistant (Day.) Of course, all three bosses were over the top caricatures of the horrible boss, so that in addition to Aniston, Farrell's Pellit is a mean pothead who inherited the company from the father he couldn't stand, and Spacey's Harken is just plain mean toward the world and everyone in it. In addition to being extremely crude, this also includes a few very funny scenes. The one that really did get me laughing was watching the scene in which Harken (Spacey) goes into anaphylactic shock and Dale (Day) saves his life by stabbing him repeatedly in the heart with his epi-pen, while his pals look on and think he's actually committing the murder. Aside from that one scene, though, I would describe this as often amusing, but not really a spectacular comedy. (6/10)",6,0,2,28 December 2011
Malcolm X," Denzel Washington Becomes Malcolm X
","I can't say that I'm particularly knowledgeable about Malcolm X - the controversial black nationalist leader assassinated in the '60's. Having said that, I really felt that this movie provided an insight into the life and growth of a truly fascinating man, who was brought to life superbly by Denzel Washington. I have always enjoyed Denzel Washington's work, and think he's one of the finest actors in Hollywood today. This is perhaps the best performance I've seen from him in a lengthy list of great performances. It seemed to me as I watched that Washington was having an almost out of (his own) body experience, truly becoming Malcolm X, as Malcolm's life was traced from his childhood, as the son of a black preacher who was killed by the KKK, to life as a young man as a hoodlum, to time in prison where he converted to Islam, through to his ultra-black nationalist stage and finally to a more moderate point, in which he was willing to work with others (even whites) - which earned him the hatred of the radical Nation of Islam, and eventually led to his death.The supporting performances here were fine, but you won't really remember them. This is Denzel Washington's movie. There are a few scenes that perhaps go on a little bit too long, but there's not really very much to criticize here. 8/10",8,3,9,2 June 2008
The Town," A Decent Gangster Movie
","There's a lot to like about this movie. Not the least of which is simply the knowledge gained that Charlestown, Massachussetts - a suburb of Boston - is apparently a breeding round for bank robbers. That may not be a great selling point for Charlestown, Massachussetts - and it may not be an issue that's really addressed or explained in any way in this movie - but it's still an interesting piece of knowledge. One also has to appreciate the performances in this. Ben Affleck was very good as Doug MacRay - a local bank robber who's involved in a heist in which a young woman (Rebecca Hall) is taken hostage, and who then falls for her and begins to develop a relationship with her (she not knowing who she is.) It's an interesting premise and - while the relationship does develop - this never falls into the trap of being a formulaic romance. The story really is about MacRay, whose growing relationship with Claire makes him want to leave the life, much to the chagrin of many of his partners in crime. That was an interesting story, made even more interesting by the fact that Claire discovers from the FBI who MacRay is and then obviously has a choice to make. The choice itself was the proper one, and the movie I thought ended on the proper note as a result.What I didn't like was the depiction of the last job the gang did. It went on far too long and became (I thought at least) unnecessarily violent; little more than a shootout eventually that went on far too long and detracted from some of the very real human interest that was involved in MacRay's personal story. Yes, it provided an opportunity for a truly hair-raising car chase, but I still thought it was overdone and a bit inconsistent with the rest of the story, which was quite good.",7,1,1,5 February 2011
Battleship Potemkin," A 'Revolutionary' Movie
","The necessary prerequisite for watching this silent classic is, of course, that you understand that it's a piece of communist propaganda, produced in the Soviet Union in 1925 as Stalin was solidifying his hold on power. (In fact, I thought the actor who played Vakulinchuk - the hero of the mutineers - even looked a bit like Stalin, probably deliberately, since it wouldn't hurt Stalin's image to be associated with the movie's hero, although it is interesting that Stalin was not always a great supporter of director Sergei Eisenstein's work or of his views on communism.) The first half of the movie is very strong. Opening with a quote from Lenin glorifying revolution in general, the story begins with the crew of the Potemkin being given rotten, maggot-infested meat to eat. Along with other brutal treatment and the contempt with which they were treated by their officers, everything leads up to a mutiny by the sailors, as they turn viciously on their officers and take over the ship. One could read into this a warning about the dangers of revolution - revolutionaries can become just as vicious and oppressive toward those who used to be their oppressors, as the oppressors were in the first place! (That might be deliberate, since part of Eisenstein's problem with Stalin was founded in his belief that film-makers should have creative freedom - hardly what Stalin wanted to offer them!) The first half of the movie very effectively builds sympathy from the viewer about conditions for the Potemkin's crew, and the mutiny itself was very well portrayed. The first half would surely gain an 8/10.Unfortunately, this movie is nowhere near as strong in the second half. There are very long stretches of basically nothing from about the 35 minute mark on. In very long scenes, the people of Odessa stream to the pier to pay homage to the sailors, the people of Odessa flee from the authorities as they attempt to re-establish control and the sailors wait for what could be a titanic confrontation with ships from a Russian squadron obviously sent to get things under control. There really was very little that interested me in the second half of the movie and, of course - given the propaganda purpose of the movie - the crew of the Potemkin are portrayed in the end as glorious victors, whereas in reality they ended up having to surrender to authorities in Romania, having accomplished little except giving Eisenstein a great story that could be easily twisted into propaganda by the Soviet Union.Overall, based largely on that very strong first half, I'd give this a 5/10.",5,3,7,2 September 2009
Elf," It's An Enjoyable Christmas Fantasy
","I'm not the biggest fan of Will Ferrell, but in casting 'Elf' someone had a brainstorm, because I have to admit that Ferrell was absolutely perfect in this role. He plays 'Buddy the Elf,' a human baby in an orphanage who accidentally hitches a ride in Santa's toy bag one Christmas Eve and finds himself at the North Pole, adopted by 'Papa Elf' (Bob Newhart) who raises him as an elf. Of course, it isn't a good 'fit,' so to speak. As a human, Buddy is a lot bigger than your average elf and, finally realizing he's human, he sets out for New York City (with no knowledge of the world outside the North Pole) and sets out to find his father, who he's been told is Walter Hobbs (James Caan) - a big publishing executive working at the Empire State Building. Essentially, the story is about Buddy trying to fit into life in the real world, and to be honest, it's really quite enjoyable and sometimes even quite funny.The cast all do quite well with their parts, although I thought that we didn't really need a love angle for Buddy, represented by Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) - who's adorably cute, but I'm not sure she was essential to the story. Every movie of this type, of course, needs a scrooge-type character to be reformed and filled with the Christmas spirit. Here, that was supposed to be Walter, but I honestly didn't find Walter to be scrooge-like enough. He seemed to be a basically nice guy who was himself just being overworked by an overbearing boss (in a limited role played by Michael Lerner.) I didn't get the jarring 'turnaround' in Walter's attitude that you often get from this. He seemed to accept Buddy too easily - with a bit of encouragement from his wife (Mary Steenburgen.) Still, while some of the characters didn't hit home as powerfully as they could have, the performances were good and they added up to a fun story.It was nice to see Ed Asner play a fairly important role as Santa in this, and the movie even managed to pay just a wee bit of homage to the TV special Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer, as Leon the Snowman who slid around at the North Pole looked basically like the sliding snowman who slid around and narrated Rudolf (although the narration for this movie, when necessary, was done by Papa Elf.) The animals in the woods at the North Pole also reminded me of the animals in Rudolf.It's a cute story, good fun for the family in the Christmas season. (7/10)",7,3,3,7 December 2012
Taxi Driver," You Spend Too Much Of Your Time Waiting
","There's more than a few things about this film that are worth liking - and liking very much. Two names stand out in particular as I assess the strong points in this: Robert Deniro and Martin Scorsese. Deniro was excellent as Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet who ends up driving a taxi because he can't sleep at night. This isn't your typical 'Vietnam vet goes crazy' movie. Aside from the fact that Travis identifies himself as a former Marine when he applies for the taxi driver's position nothing connects him to Vietnam. We assume that as an ex-Marine, discharged in 1973, he must have seen action in Vietnam, but the war there plays no role of significance in this. Essentially the entire movie is about Bickle's slow descent. He starts out as a relatively normal character, a guy who decides to make some money off his insomnia. Why not? Deniro was quite convincing as Bickle, depicting a decline that was believably gradual. Part of the credit, of course, has to go to director Scorsese as well. His direction helped build the character. He also managed to paint a totally convincing picture of a New York City in complete decay - a grimy city filled with pimps and prostitutes and drug pushers, with little apparently to redeem it. It's not a very flattering portrayal of the city that never sleeps, but it does paint a picture of what happens while the city isn't sleeping! So credit to both Deniro and Scorsese for doing effectively what they set out to do - which was painting a convincing and realistic picture.But there are problems here as well. Frankly speaking, while you watch Bickle's slow evolution (and admire Deniro's portrayal of it) you also spend most of this movie waiting. You wait for something to happen. And you wait. And then you wait some more. Yes, Scorsese made a hard-edged, realistic film. The problem is that reality doesn't always need to be portrayed. An hour goes by in this and as much as you're admiring Deniro, you're also wondering where this is going, because nothing much seems to be happening. Sure, Travis got obsessed with Becky (Cybill Shepherd) and he ended up blowing it. It seemed a couple of times as if something was going to happen as a result of that but nothing really does. Things get somewhat more interesting with the introduction of Iris (Jodie Foster) - a child prostitute Travis meets and sets out to save. That relationship is somewhat interesting, but still you wait. It's like you're a dog and Scorsese is holding a bone just beyond your reach. You know it's there and you want it, but you can't get it. The movie becomes frustrating after a while, because you know it's leading to something but there seems surprisingly little meat to chew on. Adding to the frustration is a musical score that itself seemed lifeless and inappropriate to the setting.There's something of a blood bath in the last 15 minutes or so - almost an explosion after waiting so long for what we knew was coming. There's also a pretty effective twist at the end, as Scorsese manages to get the viewer reflecting on what's normal and what's not. The whole movie seems to depict Travis sliding farther and farther out of touch with reality; the ultimate irony of the movie is that he ends up as something of a hero - which is unsettling, frankly. That was interesting and thought provoking.Still, a movie that left me waiting for so long loses a bit. Non stop action is not required. Far from it. But it often felt as if there were no point at all to this; little that it was building to. I have to say that I think it's over-rated, but certainly worth watching.",5,2,7,28 November 2010
Shutter Island," Great Suspense From Start To Finish
","What this movie does well, it does very well. Essentially, what that is is setting the right mood. From the very first scene, there's a feeling of suspense, fear, foreboding and even dread. There's something about this island. We know that, of course, but for a movie to strike that tone from its very beginning is unusual to say the least. And that feel is never really abandoned. It stays with the viewer from beginning to end - and that's absolutely essential, because for about three quarters of the movie I was feeling a bit lost. The story wasn't making any sense; there seemed to be too many different things going on inside Daniels' head - from the liberation of Dachau to the death of his wife to some suspected connection with the Red Scare to trying to piece together the mystery of this woman who's gone missing from a facility for the criminally insane, even though there was no way for her to escape and nowhere for her to go if she did. That island setting was brilliantly used by Martin Scorsese, and the scenes filmed inside 'C' Block are positively claustrophobic. For all the mystery involved with that, though, the movie suddenly comes into clear focus the moment at which Daniels encounters Dr. Cawley in the lighthouse. At that moment (even before the twist was formally revealed) I knew what was happening, and yet - a sense of uncertainty still remains. Is there going to be a double twist? You're kept on your toes until the very end.There are very good performances, especially from Leonardo DiCaprio as Daniels (although he struck me at first at least as a bit too youthful looking for the role) and from Ben Kingsley as Dr. Cawley. What pulls you in, though - and remains with you afterward - is that atmosphere so brilliantly created by Scorsese. 7/10",7,1,5,6 March 2010
Life of Pi," Ang Lee Does A Good Job Of Adapting What Must Have Been A Difficult Novel To Adapt
","Having read and enjoyed the book, I approached this movie very cautiously, wondering how ti could possibly live up to the novel on which it's based. In truth, it didn't. Rarely does a movie based on a novel manage to do that. However, while it doesn't meet the standard of the novel, I have to give credit to Ang Lee and others who were involved in the production. 'Life of Pi' (the novel) would have been a very difficult novel to adapt for the screen for a whole variety of reasons - but I think Lee and others did a commendable job of bringing the basic story to life.The film starts out relatively slowly, with an exploration of Pi's upbringing. Named 'Piscine Molitor Patel' after a swimming pool in France, Piscine adopts the shortened form of 'Pi.' He's raised in India, spends much of his time observing the animals at the zoo owned by his family and embarks on a spiritual quest, raised as a Hindu, but also adopting Islam and Christianity, because he simply wants to love God. Then, his father decides to move to Canada, and while on the way the ship they're travelling on sinks and Pi finds himself the only human survivor, adrift on a lifeboat with only a tiger named Richard Parker for companionship.The shipwreck and the voyage in the lifeboat is wonderfully portrayed, if a little bit (to say the least) unrealistic. Of course, when I say that I'm falling into the trap of the Japanese ship owners, who also can't accept that Pi's story can be real. This, of course, is the spiritual crux of the story: what, exactly, is reality? Are some stories too good to be true? Are some stories so good that they can only have come from God? It's an interesting spiritual exploration - not at all heavy handed, but often front and centre.The ocean voyage is basically a one man show, carried effectively by Suraj Sharma as Pi. The other characters, of course, are the animals in the lifeboat: Richard Parker the tiger, a zebra, a hyena and an orangutan. The animals are animated, but incredibly realistic. The older Pi, who tells the story, is played by Irffan Khan, whose soft-spoken portrayal captures the essence of the character.It's a commendable adaptation of the novel. The opening scenes in India left me a bit dry to be honest, but the very powerful portrayal of the ocean voyage drew me back in completely. Overall, a pretty decent adaptation of the novel.

Lost in Translation," Enjoyable And Innocent
","What's most appealing about this movie is the innocence of the relationship between Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). The opening half hour or so of the movie sets the stage well for what's to come. Both Bob and Charlotte are essentially 'fish out of water' characters. Bob is a movie star who's in Tokyo to shoot some commercials, while Charlotte is a young and recent Philosophy graduate who came to Tokyo with her photographer husband who then leaves her for a photo shoot. They're both lost in this strange, foreign city, and while they share that, they're developed very differently. Bob's story is semi-comic, watching him trying to understand his Japanese director and generally adjust to this bewildering city while at the same time contemplating what seems to be a more and more distant marriage, while Charlotte is more of a sad character, alone and lost and also questioning the direction she's taken and her marriage. Eventually, the two of them meet in the hotel bar and develop a semi-romantic and yet always innocent relationship as they help each other deal with their loneliness.This probably could have been developed as a straight romance. In spite of the obvious age difference, Murray and Johansson worked well together and seemed to share a real chemistry, and yet going the innocent route was the right decision. There was a sweetness and even innocent intimacy to their relationship. The innocent intimacy shone brilliantly in a simple scene where they lie fully clothed beside each other in bed, Johansson curled up in a sort of fetal position and sharing her fears of inadequacy, while Murray merely reaches down and strokes her foot. To me, that summed up what they were about together as they helped each other cope with their plights. I found myself wondering if their relationship was going to move to a physical level, and yet spent most of the movie hoping that it wouldn't because that would have spoiled what made this movie work.Murray and Johansson both offered excellent performances in a movie that is simply enjoyable to watch. 7/10",7,1,3,29 November 2009
Interstellar," Overly Long With Little Real Purpose Or Meaning
","It's almost as if those who made this movie wanted to use two and a half hours of less than stellar movie making (if you'll pardon the pun) just so that the viewer could tough it out to the end and see a ridiculously sentimental ending. Really, by the time the end finally came, I found myself wondering what the point of the whole thing was. Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) is a farmer in the midwest United States struggling along with his family to survive in some future world in which humanity is facing extinction. The atmosphere is changing so that there's less and less oxygen, and it's becoming harder and harder to grow crops. In this part of the world at least everyone seems to survive on a diet of corn, corn and more corn while being constantly threatened by horrible dust storms. I'm assuming this is meant to portray an environmental catastrophe. Eventually, Cooper and his daughter Murph (played as a young girl by Mackenzie Foy, who did well in the part) become aware that they're receiving some strange signal and they head out to investigate - an investigation that eventually leads to Cooper leaving Murph and the rest of his family behind to explore space in the hopes of finding a new home for humanity.I get it. I just didn't get excited by it. And I struggled from the start (well, once Cooper was picked for the mission anyway) with the question of why Cooper wasn't simply recruited for the mission from the beginning. He's clearly the best pilot around - which Professor Brand (Michael Caine) states openly - and he was immediately put in command of the mission, which made me wonder why they were just going to leave him playing farmer if he was really that good! That bugged me all the way through. But what bugged me more was that there was no consistency to this. There didn't seem to be any real direction to it; it didn't seem to be leading anywhere. I thought the storyline involving Mann (Matt Damon) was extraneous and just added time to the movie without adding much in the way of substance. There are a few places where it seemed as if the movie was trying to pay tribute in some way to '2001': particularly around the character of the robot TARS, and even some of the special effects/cinematography, but as I said it just didn't seem to be leading anywhere, and I wasn't entirely certain if this mission had accomplished much of anything.The entire movie seemed to be little more than a vehicle getting us to the sentimental ending. Murph had been angry that her father had left her behind, but she remembered that he promised he'd see her again, but because of differences in the way time would pass for the two of them (see: the theory of general relativity) she might be the same age as him by the time that happened. As it turned out, Murph was an old lady by the time Cooper returned to earth, and we get the sight of Cooper visiting his daughter in the hospital on her deathbed. Sentimental, yes, but I'm not sure it made the long wait to get there worthwhile. (4/10)",4,5,9,1 November 2015
Full Metal Jacket," Perhaps Stanley Kubrick's Best Movie
","I'm a fan of Stanley Kubrick's movies, and 'Full Metal Jacket' has to rank among his very best - if it's not the best, period. From the very first moment, the viewer is drawn into the film, as we watch young Marine recruits having their heads shaved in preparation for basic training. Then comes - basic training! What a horrific and yet at the same time hilarious thing to watch, as Drill Instructor Sgt. Hartman (played by R. Lee Emery, who was in fact a Gunnery Sargeant in the Marines who served in Vietnam and was told by Kubrick to 'make it real') hurls ongoing and unrelenting abuse at the men as he prepares them to go to Vietnam. This first half of the movie gives us the character of 'Private Pyle' (perhaps the most memorable character in the entire movie) - a clumsy Marine recruit at best, who becomes the target of special abuse from both Hartman and his fellow Marines. His 'evolution' is the most frightening thing in the movie, as he progresses from a kid who obviously shouldn't have been a Marine in the first place to a literal cold-blooded killer. Vincent D'Onofrio was perfect in this part.The second half of the movie shifts abruptly to Vietnam. The movie seems to weaken a little bit in this second half, maybe because it seems that we've seen this before. Movies about combat in Vietnam are hardly rare. Still, there's a great climax revolving around the fate of Eightball (Dorian Harewood) and the final demonstration that Joker (Matthew Modine) - although generally a non-combatant military reporter - has learned his killing lessons well.The odd time, Kubrick (or the writers) throw in what I thought were unnecessary scenes (I think here of the scene in 'Nam where the guys share the prostitute - that's not depicted, but we know what's happening!) That served no purpose in my opinion. The movie also lacks any really organized and consistent plot or story. It's just the experiences of these Marines. Still, it's brilliantly told. 9/10",9,1,2,12 July 2009
Empire of the Sun," Excellent And Believable
","Young Christian Bale offered a powerful performance in this drama about a young boy separated from his family after the Japanese occupation of Shanghai and sent to an internment camp, where he has to find a way to survive.Bale's portrayal of Jamie (or Jim) was the highlight of this movie. I thought he captured the boy's confusion perfectly. Raised in Shanghai, as a child of privilege living in an opulent British enclave, Jamie has lost touch with his British roots (as he notes at one point in the movie, he's never even been to Britain.) He admires the Japanese and, although he never actually says this, one gets the impression that he'd really like the Japanese to win the war. At the same time, he becomes increasingly aware of the brutal treatment those interned with him are receiving at the the hands of their Japanese captors.In the camp, Jamie is befriended by Basie (John Malkovich), an American prisoner with whom he establishes a somewhat complicated relationship. Basie comes to treat him largely as an adult; while Jamie depends on him more and more. Their friendship has its ups and downs, and Malkovich also put on a good performance in the role.Although the story is fictional, it struck me as a believable portrayal of something that could have happened. I had a little bit of trouble with the timeline. The first half of the movie is set obviously in late 1941, just before and after the Japanese attack, and then there is a sudden shift to 1945 in the last half of the movie. The intervening years are left out. One wonders about what life in the internment camp had been like in those intervening years. I found that omission of 3 plus years a bit jolting, although doing much with it would have made a long movie even longer. Essentially, as I think back to the story, three scenes remain with me: (1) when Jamie, looking for his toy plane, stumbles across the Japanese soldiers; (2) when Jamie is separated from his mother (played by Emily Richard); and (3) the last scene of the movie, which I won't describe because I don't want to spoil it.Overall, I thought this movie was excellent. 8/10",8,3,7,9 January 2006
Glory," Superb Civil War Movie That Everyone Should See
","I have watched 'Glory' many times since it first appeared in 1989, and was still thrilled to see that it was being aired again last night. I could watch this movie over and over again and never tire of it.From the graphic depiction of the Battle of Antietam that open the movie, to the graphic depiction of the Battle of Fort Wagner that closes it, this must surely rate as one of the best war movies ever. The battle scenes are meticulously recreated, the acting is absolutely brilliant and the drama compelling throughout. The 54th Massachussetts, of course, was the first all black regiment (except for the white officers who commanded it) in the history of the US Army. And this is its story - movingly told by director Edward Zwick, from the book by Lincoln Kirstein. The performances are outstanding. One hates to name anyone, because where does one start, but special mention has to be made of Matthew Broderick. As I recall, having made his name in Hollywood playing Ferris Bueller, he was something of a controversial choice for the part of the young Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. But he pulls the part off with ease. He plays Shaw quite appropriately as nervous and uncertain - promoted well ahead of his time - and having a need to be perhaps overly tough on the troops to prove his leadership. But Broderick also brings out the essential humanness of the man, his commitment to the abolitionist cause and his desire to demonstrate that his black soldiers were every bit as good as the best white soldiers the army had. Then there was Morgan Freeman as Sgt. Rollins, Denzel Washington as the angry Tripp, Jihmi Kennedy as the nervous but committed Jupiter, Andre Braugher as the educated Thomas Searles (who has his own struggle to fit in with a ragtag group of runaway slaves), Cary Elwes as Cabot Forbes, Shaw's friend and second in command. This was a true ensemble cast that worked together perfectly.Never was there a more moving scene in any movie I have seen that Col. Shaw reading the Proclamation of the Confederate Congress to his men (that all blacks captured would be returned to slavery, that any blacks captured in federal uniform would be executed and that any white officers commanding black troops would be executed) and then emerging from his tent the next morning to see if any were left (literally, as the movie depicts - and probably accurately - expecting most to be gone.)There have been some criticisms of this movie as being not 100% historically accurate (particularly the depiction of the 54th Massachussetts as being mostly ex-slaves, which apparently it was not) but to me that's just carping for the sake of wanting to find something to criticize. This is brilliant. Any student of the Civil War must watch this.It's a 10/10.",10,0,0,30 October 2001
The Devil Wears Prada," A Brilliant Caricature Of The World Of High Fashion
","This is not an outrageously funny movie, however it does offer a devastatingly effective caricature (or is it a caricature?) of the world of high fashion, mostly seen through the eyes and experiences of Andy (Anne Hathaway), a young woman who takes a job as second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the cold as ice, hard as nails editor in chief of 'Runway Magazine' - apparently the world's top fashion magazine. Andy is totally out of her comfort zone. She's not a fashion junkie and she really only took the job to get some experience in journalism. Priestly, however, takes this business very, very seriously - almost a life or death matter, and she demands the same of her staff, whose lives she turns into hell. The caricature of the fashion world is brilliant - a world where loyalty is unknown and friendship is fleeting and artificial at best; a world where (in reference to women's dress sizes) '0 is the new 2, 2 is the new 4 and 6 is the new 14;' a world in which Andy (who is very beautiful) is dismissed as 'fat' because she's a size 6. A world in which Emily (Emily Blunt) - Miranda's 'first assistant' - is on a diet that allows her to eat 'a cube of cheese' if she feels like she's about to faint.Streep was absolutely brilliant in this role, playing Miranda as totally out of control (and totally, icily in control) - a sort of Martha Stewart type of character (even the look and the voice were eerily reminiscent of Martha.) Blunt was almost her equal as her assistant (also icy cold and totally consumed by this dog eat dog world.) I thought they both outshone Hathaway, who was nevertheless quite good, portraying Andy as reluctantly stepping into this world, and then fighting not to become so caught up in it that it ruins her life. In a somewhat understated role, Stanley Tucci was also very effective as Nigel, the closest thing Miranda has to a friend on the staff.It's not the sort of comedy that will have you rolling on the floor. It's more amusing (primarily because the portrayal of the fashion world seems so accurate) and it's fun to watch. 8/10",8,0,0,10 October 2008
Rocky II," Predictable, But Fun
","Rocky II represents a decent enough follow-up to the original movie. The primary problem with it is its predictability. Rocky struggles to make a go of it without boxing, but we know from the very beginning that he's going to get back into the fight game. Otherwise, there's no movie. As in the first movie, the fight between Rocky and Apollo Creed is magnificently choreographed (although - and I have this problem with the entire 'Rocky' series - heavyweights just don't punch like that; at least not in any fight I've ever seen) but, again, the result is rather predictable (although how the result comes about is a bit of a surprise.) But one of the great things about the original was the unpredictability of the fight. Would Rocky win or lose? As I recall when I watched the original for the first time, I really didn't know. This time, you know. I mean, the result has to be the way it turns out.The performances here are decent. Sylvester Stallone was born to play Rocky Balboa. There's no doubt about that. He puts on a believable enough portrayal of a frustrated ex-fighter, unable to make his way, with a wife who doesn't want him fighting. Carl Weathers provides a fuller look at Apollo Creed, battling his personal demons after the embarrassment of his disastrous first match with Rocky. Talia Shire was I thought weaker in this movie. Adrian came across to me as more window-dressing than substance, and Burgess Meredith continued to be the epitome of the gruff old trainer.Predictability aside, I enjoyed the movie, although it was definitely not up to the standard of the original.6/10.",6,0,1,27 December 2001
Gone Baby Gone," Very Disturbing With A Powerful Ethical Dilemma
","This is definitely not the movie you want to choose on those days when you need some light entertainment. 'Gone Baby Gone' is a dark and disturbing movie that frankly, in the end, left me on a bit of a downer, although admittedly the downer was mixed with the sort of ethical dilemma that I don't mind being left with. I give points to a movie that forces me to do some thinking when it's over, and 'Gone Baby Gone' definitely does that.The movie begins as a search for a missing child is underway. The child's family hire a private detective couple (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) to help with the investigation - a decision the police (represented by Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris) are none too happy with. Over the next couple of hours, we deal with the kidnapping, with a separate case of child sexual abuse thrown in, and we're introduced to a variety of unsavoury and wholly unlikeable characters (a list that includes the missing girl's drug addicted mother, played by Amy Ryan.) The story is often confusing. With the benefit of hindsight, you can see that it was deliberately so, in order to keep the viewer off balance in preparation for the truly bizarre and completely unexpected twist as the movie plays out its last few scenes. That twist really does shake you up, and leaves you questioning what's right and what's wrong, but, as I said, it also leaves you a bit down, because you know - as does everyone else watching, and as most of the characters seem to know - that what was done was right, but also that it wasn't for the best.I can't honestly say that I enjoyed this movie, but I'm not sure that anyone intended for it to be 'enjoyed' in the normal sense of the word. It's both interesting and unpleasant, and - again - I liked the ethical dilemma we're left to grapple with. Still, a movie that leaves me on a real downer can't get more than a 4/10 from me.",4,0,1,23 May 2008
Bridget Jones's Diary," Over-Rated But Enjoyable
","After all the hype this movie received when it was released, I was almost expecting to find a comedic masterpiece that redefined the meaning of comedy. What I found instead was a mildly amusing and quite pleasant tale of a 30-something woman (Renee Zellweger) dealing with being single and in search of the right man. The stereotype bothered me a bit; this idea that Bridget just couldn't live a satisfied life unless and until she found her man. Zellweger was good in a performance that didn't really demand all that much in terms of acting ability - the idea that her performance would even be considered for an Oscar is something that I just don't understand. I'm not saying that she was bad; simply that the role didn't ask very much of her.A strong supporting cast including Hugh Grant as Daniel and Colin Firth as Mark - Bridget's rival love interests - helped move the story along. How enjoyable this movie is depends on what you're looking for. If you believed the hype you're going to get less than you expect, but if you simply go in with an open mind you'll probably find this a decent enough movie. Overall I was a little disappointed, but would still rate this effort as a 6/10.",6,1,1,18 May 2002
The Bourne Ultimatum," A Fitting End To The Trilogy
","I enjoyed 'Identity' and, frankly, was not blown away by 'Supremacy,' which left me really unsure what to expect out of 'Ultimatum.' What I found was a very entertaining and suspenseful movie that in some ways I thought was even better than the original. The loose ends that were left there (necessarily in order to keep the trilogy going) were pretty much tied up here, and Matt Damon gave another great performance in the role of Jason Bourne, in this continuing story of the mystery surrounding Bourne's identity and the CIA's involvement in turning him into this dangerous weapon. Supporting performances from David Strathairn and Joan Allen were also very good. The end of the movie clearly seems to leave open the possibility of future sequels (something along the lines of 'The Continuing Adventures of Jason Bourne' I guess) which I personally wish they would leave alone and simply be satisfied with a very successful trio of movies, but which is apparently already under development. Hardcore fans of action movies will be thrilled with that, I suppose, but I personally think the character has done as much as we could expect from him, and that we should be left with good memories of the trilogy rather than what is probably the inevitable slow descent into more and more ridiculous stories.This third movie, however, was a lot of fun. 8/10",8,0,0,4 May 2008
10 Things I Hate About You," A Stereotypical Teen Movie; Nothing Fresh Or Original About It
","I'm not going to argue with teenagers. This is a stereotypical teen movie filled with every cliché that the genre uses. And of course there are a lot of teen movies filled with those same clichés simply because they work for their target audience. This one clearly works with the target audience. It has a good rating. So be it. But my warning: if you're not a teen, please avoid this. I didn't find it funny or fresh or original. It's the same basic plot that gets respun over and over: kids (some cool and some not) desperately trying to fit in, and somehow in the midst of it all finding love in the most unexpected places. It didn't do anything for me - but then again, I'm not a teen. In fact, I wasn't really a teen even when I was a teen! So I'm definitely not the target audience. And maybe that's the reason that I spent a good part of this movie wondering about the title. What 10 things? I didn't really make the connection between the title of the movie and the content of the movie. It's like someone just made up a title out of thin air because it sounded cute or funny or something. But what did it have to do with the actual movie?It's not a bad cast, but you really have to be into this kind of movie to enjoy it. I'm not, and I didn't. It has two or three mildly humorous and/or heartwarming moments. The father/daughter talk near the end of the movie as Mr. Stratford finally lets go of Kat was basically THE heartwarming moment of the movie, and it actually worked quite well, and so left me with a bit of a more generous reaction than I might otherwise have had. Still, though, I can't honestly say that I enjoyed this in any way, shape or form. (2/10)",2,6,14,9 November 2012
Fargo," This Is One Bloody Funny Movie. Sher Is. Yaaaaah!
","OK. So this opens with a claim that it's based on a true story - supposedly actual events that occurred in Minnesota in 1987. But it turns out that the Coen brothers (directors Joel and Ethan) were lying. This isn't actually based on true events, although the Coens claim that the movie is actually a kind of composite story, weaving together strands from various cases. Usually, that kind of dishonesty would bother me, but in this case it was a relief. Frankly, this is a very violent and bloody movie - and yet at the same time it's also very funny. To be honest I'd have been upset with myself for being so amused by a movie that featured so much carnage if it actually had been true!The story revolves around the kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) - the kidnapping having been planned by her husband Jerry (William H. Macy). Jerry's in some sort of financial bind - although it's never really explained what the bind is. He needs money, and to get it he arranges for his wife's kidnapping so that his wealthy father-in- law will pay a ransom, which will then be split between the kidnappers and Jerry. Problem solved, with nobody really being hurt. But things go horribly wrong, people start being murdered, and everything spirals completely out of control. Finally local police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets involved and starts putting the pieces together, while everyone involved gets more and more frantic.This is well paced, violent and very, very funny at times. The characters are given life by a very talented cast (McDormand won an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.) Much of the humour revolves around the portrayal of the local dialect in Brainerd, Minnesota. Yaaaah. That was funny fer sher. Yaaaah.I forgive the Coen brothers. It's actually good that this wasn't really based on a true story. It makes the movie easier to laugh at.

Predator," I Found It Tedious
","There are guns and other weapons a-blazing in this sci-fi 'thriller' about an alien creature who's single-handedly wiping out an elite military team sent into the jungles of Central America to rescue some hostages. With all that, it sounds strange, but I found this tedious viewing all the way through. To me, it's most noteworthy for having two future US Governors in the cast. Jesse Ventura (future governor of Minnesota) played a small part, and Arnold Schwarzenegger (future governor of California) was the star. The story itself was repetitious all the way through, a traipse through the jungle while being stalked by a monster and the dialogue (as one might expect with this kind of movie) was weak. Schwarzenegger really was called upon to do very little except look tough - which, admittedly, he does well, and I wondered (as any thinking person would do) why the creature didn't just kill Dutch (Schwarzenegger) when it had him by the throat pinned against the tree? I suppose because that would have taken away the chance to have the really cool ending with a huge explosion and then Arnold standing victoriously in a macho pose as he looks around at the carnage. Tedious sums up all I need to say about this from my perspective.",1,15,60,3 December 2010
The Aviator," The Life, Loves And Lunacy Of Howard Hughes
","In what is surely his finest performance since 'Titanic,' Leonardo DiCaprio manages to pull off a brilliant portrayal of the early years of the eccentric (and insane) multi-millionaire Howard Hughes. The first part of the movie deals with the filming and production of 'Hell's Angels' - Hughes' motion picture about World War I aviators, and it served as an appropriate introduction to a movie that revolved around (as the title suggests) Hughes' fascination with aviation.DiCaprio is brilliant as he portrays Hughes' gradual descent into insanity. At first, as the movie opens, Hughes displays mild eccentricities (we would probably say today that he suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder.) DiCaprio manages to subtly show us Hughes becoming worse and worse until eventually he loses all touch with reality, managing to return to normalcy for a monumental battle with a Senate Committee over his airline's desire to begin transcontinental flights. Alan Alda was quite good in his role as Senator Brewster, the chair of the Committee, and someone in the pocket of the head of Pan Am Airlines (played by Alec Baldwin.) The depiction of the Senate hearing was brilliant, and left no doubt that Brewster - knowing of Hughes' fragile mental state - was an utterly beaten man, obviously taken completely off guard by a totally in control Hughes.The film depicts Hughes' various romances, focusing especially on those with Katherine Hepburn (Kate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), which served as an opportunity to show Hughes' growing paranoia. The last scene of the movie is particularly haunting to anyone who knows how Hughes' life turned out. The relationship with Gardner (and the role she played in getting him on his feet before the Senate Committee hearings) was especially interesting.I enjoyed the movie very much, although it seemed that it dragged a bit in places. Perhaps at times it became a bit too concerned with details (not unlike Hughes himself, actually) and, if we were going to get an almost 3 hour movie about Hughes, it might have been more satisfying to have less detail about these particular years and extend the movie into Hughes' later years. Perhaps fodder for a sequel. Having said that, this is a very good and very interesting movie, which I rate as a 7/10.",7,3,4,1 January 2006
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," One Of Robin Williams' Best
","I find Robin Williams frustrating as an actor. He can be both very funny and he can pull off dramatic roles well. For such a versatile actor, though, he often ends up taking the parts he plays a little too over the top and can sometimes distract from the story. 'Good Morning, Vietnam' was a very good performance by Williams, though, which allowed him to display both his comedic and dramatic talents.Williams played military DJ Adrian Cronauer, who hosted an Armed Forces Radio show out of Saigon in the mid 1960's during the Vietnam War. Cronauer was an innovative DJ, trying to make military radio sound more like civilian radio back home. The military, however, is very steeped in tradition, and Cronauer's efforts weren't universally appreciated by the military brass, with whom he often butted heads.Williams did a good job as Cronauer the DJ. In fact, you could say that he was tailor made for the part. Having said that, the real life Cronauer acknowledges that he wasn't as over the top as Williams portrayed him. So the movie isn't a biography; it was made for entertainment purposes. I suspect that much of the dramatic content of the movie was fictional. It revolved around a Vietnamese woman who became Cronauer's love interest and her brother, who became Cronauer's best friend until he was discovered to have been a Viet Cong member.This is, perhaps surprisingly, a reflective movie at times, giving the opportunity for the viewer to think about the Vietnam War through a number of scenes. It's definitely one of Robin Williams' best performances, and he's supported by actors such as J.T. Walsh and Forest Whittaker. (7/10)",7,1,1,24 January 2014
Burn After Reading," A Little Bit Of Potential Lost In A Whole Lot Of Muddle
","'What did we learn, Palmer?' 'I don't know, sir.' 'I don't f...'in know either. I guess we learned not to do it again.' That exchange between the head of the CIA (I guess) and one of his agents closes out this movie and about sums up my reaction to this movie. After more than an hour and a half, I don't really have a clue what happened, and I sure hope it doesn't lead to anything else!There was some potential, and I confess that I really did chuckle a few times at some of the ridiculous situations that were portrayed, but overall this whole thing was a muddle of those ridiculous situations. The basic premise seemed to be promising. An ex-intelligence officer leaves a disc with what appears to be classified information on it at the gym after a workout. It's found and two employees - Linda and Chad (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt) - decide to use it to make some money to help Linda pay for some cosmetic surgery she wants. It almost sounds like it could have been a slapstick sort of semi-spy caper, but it just didn't seem to work. The attempts to get laughs out of the viewer seemed too forced - everyone seemed to be trying too hard to be funny, but humour needs to flow more naturally to be truly funny. Of all the cast, the only one I really enjoyed watching was Brad Pitt, who was cast a bit against type. He's a sort of gay-like (because that was never really spelled out but seemed implied) fitness coach. Other than that, I was quite underwhelmed by everyone and everything. 2/10",2,9,18,26 January 2010
The Bourne Identity," Fantastic Action, But The Story Is Hardly Original
","I'm not particularly a fan of the whole action-movie genre, but I have to say that, in 'The Bourne Identity', you have to love the action. It really does make the movie. The fight scenes are incredible, and the chase scene as Bourne (Matt Damon) leads the Paris police on a car chase through the city is amazing. The action alone makes this worth watching.The story on the other hand is somewhat intriguing as we untangle some of the mystery revolving around Bourne's identity, but the basic premise (which isn't hidden at all in the movie) has a ring of familiarity to it. Bourne is some sort of super-CIA operative who's lost his memory and has no idea of who he was or what he did for a living, but he sure does have some amazing abilities that he hasn't forgotten. As we're told during the movie, he's a $30 million weapon that's malfunctioning. That didn't strike me as particularly original, although it was unclear (to me at least) whether his abilities came from genetic engineering, some type of implant or just incredible training.Damon's performance was quite good, and I thought Franka Potente came across well as Marie, the woman who helps Bourne and begins to fall for him at the same time, even while becoming increasingly uncomfortable as more is revealed about his past. It's enjoyable and exciting, even if it has a bit of a well-worn premise, and it caught my interest enough to make me want to see the sequels. 7/10",7,0,1,1 November 2007
Man of Steel," Somebody Decided To Take This Way Too Seriously
","'Man of Steel' has way too many explosions and crashing spacecraft and simply overdoes it with general mayhem. And, somewhere along the way, Superman got lost. Yes, Henry Cavill was here playing the part, wearing a blue costume and red cape, but I'm talking about what you might call the spirit of Superman; the sense of fun that should be a part of this. It's based on a comic strip for goodness' sake. And what happened to truth, justice and the American way? Really, this just turned into a non-stop battle between Superman (or 'Kal' as they called him - short for Kal-El) and General Zod (Michael Shannon.) And the fact that it was essentially non-stop meant that, really, it became quite dull, and there were points during the mayhem when I found myself thinking, 'good grief, not more.' But, yes, there was more. Always more.It just wasn't interesting. If all you care about are explosions and mayhem then it will satisfy, but if you care about story or characters or performances? Well, this is totally lacking in any of that. Cavill, Shannon or Amy Adams as Lois Lane? They all faded into the background, because the star of the movie was the overdone special effects and action.The most obvious comparison to Man of Steel would be Superman II in the Christopher Reeve series of movies. That one, in my opinion, was immeasurably better. It had a story that flowed well from beginning to end, whereas I found the story in Man of Steel - especially in the early going - to be disjointed and difficult to follow. The Reeve version also had the sense of fun added by Gene Hackman's portrayal of Lex Luthor, or even Margot Kidder's turn as Lois. There was no character in this that one could have fun with.With the emphasis on the alien ships and assorted ominous looking alien outfits, plus the explosions and spacecraft, one got the impression that director Zack Snyder really wanted to do a Star Wars-Superman hybrid, with the emphasis definitely on Star Wars.

The Caine Mutiny," Highlighted By Superb Performances
","It's not 'Mutiny On The Bounty.' When a movie has 'mutiny' in the title there's probably an automatic tendency to think of it in terms of that 1935 classic. And Humphrey Bogart as Captain Queeg is not Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh. True enough. But once you set aside the expectation that any mutiny movie will be somewhat like 'Mutiny On The Bounty' and that any captain who drives his crew to mutiny will be a little bit like Captain Bligh you can start to enjoy this movie on its own merits - and it is a very good movie highlighted by some superb performances.Bogart was the real highlight. He did a marvellous job of portraying Queeg on the edge. Queeg wasn't a sadistic monster. He was paranoid and unsure of himself but not sadistic, and the mutiny didn't come about because he abused the crew (he merely insisted on discipline) but because the crew felt endangered by what they perceived as his incompetence. Queeg was an interesting character - the one who inspired the mutiny but one also that you feel some sympathy for. Bogart's performance reaches its climax - as does the movie as a whole - in its portrayal of the court martial, where Queeg comes unglued. This was a brilliant performance, maybe not Bogie's best, but one that shouldn't be missed. The rest of the cast also rose to the occasion and did a wonderful job. I give special mention to Fred MacMurray. I've never been a particular fan of MacMurray. Generally speaking in anything I've seen him in he comes across as lacking both passion and energy - a technically competent actor but one who just doesn't grab me. He was, however, very good here as Lt. Keefer - the first crew member to question Queeg's mental competence, who then lacks the courage to acknowledge that fact at the court martial and leaves Lt. Maryk (Van Johnson) holding the bag.The story itself is interesting, although not especially exciting. There are some decent portrayals of shipboard life, especially the danger facing the Caine when the typhoon hits - which is the incident that causes the mutiny. There's far too much attention paid to Lt. Keith's personal life. Robert Francis handled that role well, but the relationships Keith had with his sweetheart and his mother were sidebars that didn't add anything of real significance to the story. There was a worthwhile (if brief) reflection on the issue of social class, the point being that one of Queeg's problems was that he was looked down upon by his own officers. He came from a humble background and was in the navy making lousy money for years, while with the outbreak of World War II he found himself surrounded by subordinates who had been busy making money while he was serving his country. So there's a lot of good material here, although I don't think there's quite enough to qualify this as a classic.",7,0,1,8 March 2011
Radio," Great Performances In A Well Done Fact-Based Film
","The highlights of this film are the two absolutely superb performances by Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris. Gooding was the title character - James Robert Kennedy, a mentally disabled young man known simply as 'Radio' because of his love for radios. Harris played Harold Jones - a local high school teacher who was also coach of the Hanna High School football team and the school's athletic director. The movie is the portrayal of how their relationship develops, with Jones taking the young man under his wing, so to speak, and making him part of both the team and the school community, fighting the efforts of many of the townsfolk and school board officials to have him removed.It's certainly a heartwarming story, although it's not exactly what I'd call a tearjerker, although there are moments when tears might flow (particularly the death of Radio's mother.) There are question raised throughout the movie that are often hard to deal with. One admires Jones' devotion to Radio, but one wonders why he seems unable to show the same devotion to his own daughter. It's great to see Radio becoming gradually accepted as part of the team and school, but the movie doesn't shy away from the question of whether he isn't being treated more as a mascot than anything else - certainly a question that ran through my head on a number of occasions as we watch Radio lead the team on the the field and join the cheerleading squad from time to time. Jones' own personal motivation is finally explained as he relates a childhood experience to his daughter that illustrates why he feels so strongly for Radio. In the end, Radio's place within the life of the school is made more 'official' and Kennedy is apparently still roaming the halls and the sidelines of Hanna High as an official 11th Grade student for as long as he wants to be one - this being based on a true story.'Based on a true story' always makes me wonder. Kennedy is real, and he's really at Hanna High and he and Jones are really friends, so there's obviously a strong basis in fact for this movie. I wondered, though, about what seemed to be the surprisingly easy acceptance of Radio among the townspeople. Although the whole community was concerned about the on-field performance of the football team, aside from one parent and one school board official, people seemed largely unconcerned about or uninterested in Radio himself - which struck me as a surprisingly bland reaction for a small southern town in the late 1960's to have for a mentally disabled young black man. But clearly it worked long term. I did appreciate that this was about much more than the football team. The football team was the backdrop for what happened, but no more than that. This was't an 'underdog overcomes' sports story. The Hanna High team didn't have a great season in this movie; neither Radio nor Coach Jones inspired them to win anything of significance. The football team just became in some ways a microcosm of the community, as they grew more and more accepting of Radio, to the point at which Radio's presence was simply a given.This is a very well done film, one of the better 'based on a true story' films I've come across.

Cast Away," A Good Movie Marred By A Very Weak Ending
","I have to confess right off that I find the basic premise of this movie difficult to believe. I just really do not accept that with modern satellite technology, etc., there could be very many unknown islands anywhere in the world. True, the reason that Chuck Noland, played by Tom Hanks, couldn't be found was that his plane had veered off course, and no one was looking for him in the area he was found in. OK. Maybe. But I still find it hard to accept.Setting that aside, I enjoyed most of this movie. Tom Hanks showed again why he is one of Hollywood's best in what for most of the movie is a one-man show. He manages to hold the attention of the viewer as we root for him in his struggle for survival. Noland, a hard-driving FedEx executive obsessed with time and his work suddenly, after a plane crash leaves him stranded on an island, finds himself with too much of the former and not enough of the latter. The island becomes for him a school of hard knocks as he learns how to survive on his own with just the basics. Hanks does a great job with this part, and especially compelling is the relationship Noland develops with 'Wilson' the volleyball - a relationship that brings forth both laughs and a few tears from anyone watching. Humour in a largely difficult movie is also brought forth by Noland's obsessive decision to sort the FedEx packages that washed ashore with him. I think this movie would have been much stronger if Noland had simply stayed on the island, and we had been able to watch Hanks work more deeply with this part of the role.(SPOILERS AHEAD)Unfortunately, he has to be rescued. And here's where the movie starts to unravel. Even after all the time he has spent on the island, Noland doesn't strike me as the type who could build a particularly good raft, and the raft he does build doesn't strike me as one that could stand up to the storms and wind and waves of the South Pacific. But it does. He gets rescued by a passing ship after being watched over by a huge whale. Noland then makes what to me seemed to be a very fast (4 weeks) transition to life after 4 years on his island, except that when he gets home he is absolutely transfixed by being able to turn an electric light on and off. (They had no lights on the ship for him to experiment with?) Noland returns expecting to be reunited with his fiancÃ© Kelly (Helen Hunt), only to find her married and a mother. Hunt does a decent job of portraying the confusion that would be felt in such circumstances, but the entire last half hour of the movie just seemed to be a pitifully weak ending to what had been a pretty good movie, although I get the point: just as Noland was cast away on the island, so is he cast away (by the woman he loves) once he gets home. (I have to confess that I was grateful that the movie didn't go for the sappy ending that we seemed to be heading for after Noland delivered his package.)In the end, this strikes me as no better than a 7/10.",7,0,1,15 July 2001
The Thing," An Excellent Remake Of The 1951 Classic
","Given that this movie received largely negative reviews when it was released in 1982, I confess that I decided to watch it mostly out of curiosity to see how bad it really was. After viewing it, what I don't understand are the views of the critics. I thought this really was a superb remake of the 1951 movie of the same name, different enough to be a totally unique movie-watching experience, but maintaining the same basic plot. My attention was captured from the very beginning, with the scenes of the helicopter chasing the husky across the antarctic landscape, with a gunman on board desperately trying to kill the animal. What's going on? Once we discover that the dog is in fact the alien being (an alien who consumes its victims and then takes on their identical form) the story progresses and becomes completely bewildering (appropriately so, because a big part of the suspense is that neither the viewers nor the characters in the movie know who has been infected by these aliens and who hasn't) and at the same time extremely suspenseful, and sometimes downright frightening.Kurt Russell did a great job in the lead role, and was surrounded by a very capable group of actors who put on a fantastic show. Perhaps worthy of note is that this may be the only movie I've ever seen with an all-male (and I mean totally) cast. There's not a woman to be found in this one. The setting (in an isolated Antarctic scientific outpost) is bleak and claustrophobic, in spite of the fact that there's a lot of open space, and so very effective in creating the perfect mood. The movie is rather gory at times, and the idea for the alien creatures is perhaps borrowed a little too obviously from the movie 'Alien.' The end is completely anti-climactic and leaves a great deal up in the air, which suggests perhaps that there was hope for a sequel which never came to pass because of the poor reception this movie got. That poor reception was mistaken, though. This is an excellent movie. 8/10",8,1,4,16 August 2009
Armageddon," At Best A Bad Joke
","Where does one begin with this movie, except to say that it's very bad. Let's begin with some of the more obvious things. First, it's hard to believe that with all of today's available technology an asteroid large enough to destroy the world could be found only 18 days before it hits! But let's assume for a moment that it's true. NASA decides that the only way to stop this from happening is to send people with drilling experience to the asteroid to implant explosives to blow the thing up. Well, maybe, but then we have to take seriously the proposition that the only people in the world who could do this are the rather motley crew assembled. We then have to believe that in less than 18 days (they have to be assembled from all over the world and then they have to fly to the asteroid, which would surely take 2 or 3 days anyway) they can be trained first to deal with space flight and then to actually work on the surface of this asteroid (surely drilling on an asteroid is a little different than drilling on earth?) It kind of makes a mockery of the whole astronaut training program doesn't it? Completely over the top performances from everyone involved make this movie cartoonish. Complete with the requisite love story between Grace and A.J. (Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck) it's really a bad joke, although the last few minutes, which feature Harry's (Bruce Willis) eventual solution to the problem weren't bad. Still, no better than a 2.",2,4,9,25 March 2007
The Village," One Of Shyamalan's Weaker Efforts
","I've liked a lot of M. Night Shyamalan's movies, ('Signs' and 'The Sixth Sense' jump to my mind immediately) but to me at least 'The Village' didn't quite live up to expectations. The mystery supposedly hidden in this movie about this village faced with mysterious creatures living in the woods surrounding it isn't particularly well-hidden. I figured that out about half way through when I realized that one of the men was wearing a very modern-looking suit, whereas the movie sets you up to think of this as being set somewhere in the past. I realized at that point that what we were dealing with here wasn't really a horror movie; it was more of a psychological study of what was essentially cult-like behaviour: a group of people who have chosen to isolate themselves from society, and who use fear as a method of mind-control to prevent people from leaving. In that, it didn't really provide anything of earth-shaking importance - it simply painted a portrait of life in this 'village,' and it did so with a number of problems hanging over it. To me, it was inconceivable that such a village could be kept totally isolated, given the need for people in the 'real world' to guard it (as the ending of the movie makes clear.) That bit of unreality aside, the predictability of the story took a lot of enjoyment away from it, as did the strange decision to have the characters speak in that stilted manner of speech that they used. That seemed to have no logical purpose other than to help to create an atmosphere that convinces you that you're dealing with a community that existed generations ago. Why would they adopt that manner of speech? What difference would it make to them? It really didn't make sense, and frankly it became quite annoying after a while. With the words used and the way the lines were being delivered, it was kind of like watching a movie that starred a cast of emotionless and over-proper Vulcans (if you get the Star Trek analogy.) I have to say that I was disappointed. Shyamalan can do (and has done) a lot better than this.",4,1,2,26 March 2009
21," It Didn't Do A Lot For Me
","It was OK. That about sums up my reaction to '21.' My primary reason for thinking it was just OK is that the whole thing just didn't ring true to me, in spite of the claim that it's based on a true story. Based on what I've read about the movie's background since watching it, I think I'd describe that as 'very loosely based ...' Essentially, the story is about an MIT student (Ben, played by Jim Sturgess) who needs $300,000 to attend Harvard Medical School. How's he going to get it? He's applied for a full scholarship, but although he's brilliant, it's not looking good. Then , along comes one of his math professors (Kevin Spacey), who turns out to be a former gambler who's developed a system for counting cards in Blackjack and then recruits the best and brightest students at MIT to be his team - he teaches them the system and they fly to Las Vegas repeatedly to gamble and share their winnings, until they get caught.Setting aside the Hollywood deviations from the 'true story,' I just didn't find this to be all that interesting, nor did I feel any particular sympathy for or closeness to anyone, except maybe Ben's two former best friends, who essentially get the brushoff from Jim once he's embraced his new lifestyle as a high roller. For whatever reason, there was an attempt to build an unnecessary romance into the story between Ben and one of the female gamblers which added nothing to the story. There's a twist near the end that did take me just a little bit by surprise, so I give credit for that, but overall I was disappointed with this. I've certainly seen better (and truer) movies. 4/10",4,4,5,31 August 2009
The Revenant," DiCaprio Holds Together An Over-Rated But Watchable Movie
","I was surprised to discover that 'The Revenant' was based on a true story - then disappointed to learn that it was only very loosely based on a true story - a lot of important details in the movie (like Glass's Pawnee wife and son) are simply not true, and the real story of Hugh Glass wasn't really a revenge story. What was true was the bear attack. I was familiar with the silly story about Leonardo DiCaprio (or really Glass, his character) being 'raped' by the bear. That was utterly ridiculous. The movie made clear that this was a female bear with cubs nearby. Why anyone would start such a story is beyond me. It was a bear attack - a pretty vicious one that was very well portrayed. And, as I said, it's really the primary connection to the real story of Hugh Glass.Set in 1823, the movie starts strongly, with a depiction of an Indian attack on a group of American fur traders. That's very well choreographed. In fact, overall - including the depiction of the bear attack and the choreography of the Indian attack - the strongest part of the movie is probably the work of director Alejandro Inarritu. His work was excellent. All throughout the movie you see great camera work, excellent photography and spectacular scenery. All that is so good - and, in fact, it's almost too much. It seems to take over the movie at times. That's probably because the story as a whole didn't exactly enthrall me. The movie is set up as a revenge story, with Glass hunting down Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) - who had killed his half Pawnee son. As I said, that's fake, and really the movie doesn't emphasize the revenge element. This is really a survival story - and there are times when you wonder how Glass survived. How did he survive the wounds from the bear attack? How did he survive the raging river and waterfall? Why didn't he freeze to death once he got out of the river, soaking wet in the middle of winter with snow on the ground? How did he survive the plunge over the cliff? He's almost superhuman - the survival scenes are too unbelievable to make Glass a character you can really empathize with. There are also more than a few cringe worthy moments. There is that gruesome bear attack. There's Glass cauterizing his own wounds. There's Glass gutting the horse so he can crawl in to stay warm. Yeah. I was wincing a few times. But those are scattered throughout the story, and for long periods there's not much to fall back on but the scenery and photography. It's beautiful, yes, but some of it could probably have been taken out for the sake of making a tighter and more focused movie.Having said that, the story did grow on me as it went along and came closer to the climactic confrontation between Glass and Fitzgerald. I admit my attention wandered a few times, but I was never tempted to just step away from this. DiCaprio offered a basically one man show for extended periods, and was all right doing that. I've probably seen actors pull it off better than he did (Tom Hanks in Cast Away, James Franco in 127 Hours, maybe even Robert Redford in All Is Lost all come to mind) but DiCaprio was pretty good in holding it all together. And I did like the ending. The final scenes in which Glass finally confronts Fitzgerald were very well done. It wasn't true, but it was well done. Interestingly, I also found a pretty consistent spiritual theme running through the movie - which I wasn't actually expecting.I think this is a bit over-rated, but it was worth watching.

Trouble with the Curve," To Me, This Totally Missed The Mark
","I came away from this thinking that so much more could have been done with it. There was a potentially powerful story here about the troubled relationship between a father and daughter and their attempt to reconnect. The father and daughter were played by actors for whom I have a very high regard - the veteran Clint Eastwood, and I've been enchanted with Amy Adams ever since I saw her in 'Enchanted.' And they were both very good in their roles - Eastwood as the dad, an aging baseball scout with failing vision who's nearing the end of the road and Adams as his daughter, who's on the fast track to becoming a partner with a major law firm. The story has Gus (Eastwood) being sent to scout a high school baseball phenom and Mickey (Adams) going with him to help him out. Theirs is a distant and troubled relationship. The question is 'why?' And the problem is that not enough focus is put on the relationship and its history and on their reconciliation. Other than portraying their distance from each other, maybe 10 minutes of the movie explores the background of the relationship. That was a missed opportunity. It could have been a powerful story, except that the writers clearly aren't satisfied with this being an emotional roller coaster of a ride through a troubled father-daughter relationship, and they want us to think of this as a baseball movie. And that was a problem.Gus was a scout. I get that. But the behind the scenes machinations going on in the Atlanta Braves organization (supposedly) didn't strike me as believable. If you want to see behind the scenes baseball portrayed, watch 'Moneyball.' It does a much better job of that. Then there was the high school baseball phenom Bo Gentry (played by Joe Massingill.) As far as I was concerned, he should have been no more than a minor backdrop. The only thing relevant about the character was that Gus - for all the limitations age had brought on - was still able to scout him properly. He couldn't hit a curve ball. Aside from that he really didn't matter to the story, so why keep going back to him? I didn't care at all that he was an arrogant, obnoxious, self absorbed jerk. I don't know why that had to be stressed as much as it was. I don't know why there was a need to have the young Red Sox scout thrown into the picture. OK. I do know. For whatever reason, there needed to be a potential romance for Mickey. Why did there need to be a potential romance for Mickey? I really don't know, except that Amy Adams is cute, and I guess Hollywood figures that a character played by someone as cute as Amy Adams needs a romance. But I really didn't care about her relationship with Johnny (Justin Timberlake.) Adams' time would have been better spent in more powerful scenes with Eastwood than in fluff stuff with Timberlake. And the closing scenes where Mickey brings in a curve ball throwing phenom (Jay Galloway) she's discovered and gets him a tryout with the Braves, setting him up against Gentry in a workout struck me as just plain dumb.There was some potentially good material in this, and there were two great actors who could have done a lot if that potential had been used. Unfortunately it wasn't, and the whole movie suffered as a result, becoming bogged down in too much baseball at the expense of where the real meat of the story was. (3/10)",3,1,2,24 February 2013
Pitch Black," A Very Pleasant Surprise; Good Performance By Vin Diesel
","Exciting and interesting from the start, I have to say that while I approached this movie with at best limited expectations I came away from it pleasantly surprised. Vin Diesel is not really my cup of tea as an actor, but in fact he put on a very good performance in this futuristic sci-fi drama as Richard Riddick, a convicted murderer who's being transported to prison on a spaceship that crashlands on a strange alien world. Once there, the survivors discover that there are terrifying creatures who come out only in the dark, which at first doesn't seem much of a problem since the planet has three suns and is never dark. They then discover, though, that the planet is about to go into an eclipse, plunging it into complete darkness for an unknown length of time, and releasing the creatures to hunt them down.Diesel's Riddick ends up as the hero of the movie, because he has surgically enhanced eyesight that allows him to see in the dark, and so he takes on the task of leading the others to safety. This movie is at times frightening, and on the odd occasion graphic, but not gratuitously so. A lot of effort was put by director David Twohy into developing the character of Riddick, and into portraying the change as the others slowly learn to trust him with their lives. I thought it slowed down a bit in the last third or so of the movie, and somehow became less interesting once the creatures were actually released by the eclipse. There seemed to be far more suspense as the survivors tried to figure out some of the mysteries of the planet and as they faced the approaching darkness. Once the darkness came, in some ways the movie became a pretty standard sci-fi monster type of movie. Still, it was a lot better than I had expected it to be. 7/10",7,5,7,9 July 2009
Cold Mountain," Both Pointless And Charmless, But It Does Have Renee Zellweger
","Essentially, this movie could have chosen to move in one of two ways: either as a war movie, depicting the agony that the Civil War wrought upon the South and its citizens, or as a romance, depicting the agony of lovers separated by war and uncertain whether they'll ever see each other again. In the end, it tries to do both, with the emphasis being on the romance, and, in the end, I found neither part of the story - which seemed to me to jump around far too much, giving it an unfocused feel - either convincing or compelling. The challenges faced by the South are realistically portrayed, particularly with the emphasis on the 'Home Guard' - a group of Southerners tasked with the job of searching down deserters and those sheltering them, and who, as the war approached its inevitable conclusion, chose to abuse their positions to satisfy their own desires rather than to fulfill their admittedly distasteful job. This part of the story was often brutal - perhaps realistically so - but it left me rather empty to be honest.As to the romance, it struck me as both forced and artificial. Neither Ada (Nicole Kidman) nor Inman (Jude Law) came across to me as star-crossed lovers, although I suppose that the point of the movie was that it was their love for each other that gave them hope, and the strength to get through their trials. Still, neither character really connected with me. The one character I did like was Ruby (Renee Zellweger) although, to be honest, it wasn't so much the character that appealed to me as it was Zellweger playing the character. Zellweger is a fine actress who seems to be able to take on any role in any type of movie and make it work. As to Law and Kidman, neither appealed to me. Law seemed flat, and Kidman, who is a very beautiful woman, nevertheless generally underwhelms me with her performances.For Zellweger's performance alone, 2/10",2,3,6,5 April 2008
American Psycho," What Was That, Anyway?
","I don't know quite what to do with this movie. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a young, Wall Street powerbroker type who, in his spare time, enjoys critiquing albums, kinky sex and murder - and not necessarily in that order! Bale - the only actor in the movie of any significance - is actually rather good in the part, as he shows Bateman descending farther and farther into insanity, finally reaching out for help but not being able to find anyone who believes him. He goes a little overboard at times, but then again that's in keeping with the character.My basic problem with the movie was that I didn't think it ever decided where it wanted to go. It's publicized as a thriller, and as a thriller it's absolutely awful. I first thought that it might be a serious attempt to construct a psychological profile of a serial killer. Forget that. There's no serious attempt to do anything in this movie. It doesn't work too well as a straight thriller either, for one simple reason: there's nothing particularly frightening about it! It simply contains the normal slasher-type violence you would expect in this genre, and, of course, grotesquely mutilated bodies pop up in the most unexpected places - except that, because we've seen these types of movies before, we expect them to pop up! But, on the other hand, maybe this could be looked at as one of those 'thrillers' that's so bad it's actually funny. (Or, maybe it's actually intended to be a black comedy. If so, it's not too bad.) And, at times, it really is funny! Let's just say that I spent far more time laughing than I did perched on the edge of my seat!Aside from Bale's performance (and I'm still not sure if he put on a great comedic performance or a lousy dramatic performance) the supporting cast was mediocre. Willem Dafoe had little to do in the role of Donald Kimball, a police detective who seems to be suspicious of Bateman as he investigates one of the murders, but then seems to do little to follow up on his suspicions except take Bateman out to lunch. The best performance of the weak supporting cast was probably that of Cara Seymour as the prostitute Christie, who becomes a participant in Bateman's kinky games.So, again, what to do with this? Maybe just forget it and 'return the video?' (You have to have seen the movie to understand that reference.) Or maybe that's too harsh. I mean, it isn't terrible; it's just not very good. The combination of a lousy thriller and a not-so-bad comedy (and, I might add, that either way it falls apart with what I thought was a terribly weak ending) gives this a rating of 4/10.",4,0,2,10 March 2001
Little Miss Sunshine," Welcome To Hell
","I was totally unfamiliar with this movie, but based on the title I was expecting it to be either an expose or a parody of the whole child beauty contest concept. It accomplishes that, but only in the last twenty minutes or so, after the Hoover family arrives at the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant so that Olive (Abigail Breslin) could compete. To be honest, I found the whole portrayal of the pageant a bit creepy, watching these young girls dressed up like adults and marching around in bathing suits, covered in makeup. I've never actually been to any contest like that, but from pictures I've seen in the media I would imagine that this wasn't far off the mark. Frankly it's sad that such contests exist; sadder still that there are parents who actually let their daughters compete in them.OK. Enough of the sermon. On to the movie itself. My expectations notwithstanding, this movie wasn't actually about the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant. It was really the story of a completely dysfunctional family struggling to somehow come together during a journey from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach to make Olive's dream come true. And this family was dysfunctional. There's the brother (Paul Dano) who refuses to talk, the gay uncle (Steve Carell) who tried to kill himself, the grandpa (Alan Arkin) who's obsessed with sex and drugs, the father (Greg Kinnear) who's obsessed with success at all costs and the mother (Toni Collette) who - well, I never actually did quite figure her out.The problem as far as I was concerned was that, while they may have been dysfunctional, I didn't find any of these people to be fun, and some of them were downright unlikeable. Brother Dwayne's message to Uncle Frank as he took up residence with the family ('Welcome to Hell') struck me as a totally accurate portrayal of life in that home, and not a bad description of the movie itself.There were a few good scenes. Smuggling grandpa's body out of the hospital was mildly amusing, and the final moments of the trip to Redondo Beach as the family struggles to figure out how to get to the hotel was a pretty good ride. Grandpa also offered what I thought was a pretty good definition of a loser - 'someone who's so afraid of not winning that they don't even try.' I can buy that. The final moments of the movie, however - revolving around Olive's dance number at the competition - turned me off completely. It might have succeeded in bringing the family together, but that they would come together around such a grotesque performance for a child that age was pathetic. In general terms, I found very little here that I liked. 3/10",3,5,10,3 November 2007
North by Northwest," Engaging From Start To Finish
","I want to say first that I liked this movie. I also have to say that I expected a little bit more from a movie that's considered one of the best ever made, and one of the best (if not THE best by many people) movies ever directed by Alfred Hitchcock. I found it to be an engaging movie, most certainly. It never lost my attention. There was enough going on that I wanted to know how things were going to turn out, and there were even a few situations in which it was impossible to know who's side a particular character was on. All that worked very well for me.I was also impressed by the performances from the three primary leads. Cary Grant was quite good as Roger Thornhill, a New York City businessman who through a case of mistaken identity ends up on the run as apparently Eastern bloc agents try to pull off some sort of scheme (that isn't really revealed until close to the end of the movie.) Thornhill is maybe a little too good at times - your normal businessman who seems to take too readily to the undercover espionage business. But Grant did well as the character. James Mason was the villain Philip Vandamm and was able to offer the perfect combination of menace and charm - just enough to make his character (who could have been quite one dimensional) interesting. And, of course, there had to be a beautiful woman - in this case Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall, who becomes involved with Thornhill but is actually working for Vandamm.I'm not sure that I'd agree that this was Hitchcock's finest performance as a director. He made a movie that was engaging, but not really spellbinding, although he managed to do a good job of gradually building the suspense.Certainly,. this is a very good movie. I'd argue, though, that it's a wee bit over-rated. Still very good, though. (7/10)",7,2,3,13 January 2014
Knowing," Pretty Heavy And At Times Creepy
","I suppose that any movie that deals ultimately with the end of the world has to be at times heavy. This one definitely qualifies on that count. It opens with a portrayal of children at a Massachussetts elementary school planting a time capsule in 1959 that was to be opened 50 years later. The children all draw pictures of what the future would be like, except for obviously troubled Lucinda, who scribbles out what seems to be a random set of numbers. Fast forward 50 years and the time capsule is opened. Young Caleb gets Lucinda's paper, and his father John - an MIT astrophysics professor who lectures his class about the competing theories of randomness vs. purpose - becomes fascinated with it and finally realizes that it's a list of dates when tragedies will happen, showing not only when they'll happen but where and how many will die.From that point on there's a real creepiness to the movie as the next two of Lucinda's prophecies come true, and John finally realizes what the final one (which didn't identify a number of people killed, but simply recorded 'EE') is. Through most of the movie there was a sort of quasi-religious, sort of new age/sort of Christian theme going on. There are a number of biblical references, and it turns out that John's father is a pastor, although John himself is filled with doubt, especially after the death of his wife before the movie started. The final prophecy (as it starts to unfold) creates suspense but also became a little bit silly, as the identities of the 'whisperers' was revealed. Their identity wasn't really a surprise - there were perhaps 3 possibilities for who or what they were, and any of them could have worked as the basis for the movie. The closing scene returns to the quasi-religious theme as Caleb and Abby find themselves in a Garden of Eden type environment, heading toward a tree. Is the Genesis story now just going to begin again, with these two as Adam and Eve?I liked Nicholas Cage as John. He did a good job with the part and this was clearly his movie. The feeling of silliness as the movie came to an end aside, this was a pretty suspenseful movie with a pretty good depiction of the apocalypse at the end. 8/10",8,2,5,23 December 2009
Hugo," If You Can Get Past A Dull And Slow Paced First Hour This Becomes Fairly Interesting
","My first reaction when this came to an end was that no matter its quality, it was tailor made for an Oscar nomination. Let's be honest. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is nothing if not a little bit self-serving, and much of the last half of this movie - once Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley) is revealed to be the early French film-maker Georges Melies (who is probably most famous for 'A Trip To The Moon,' which he made in 1902) - is essentially set aside as a celebration of the early days of movie-making. So, to me, that explains the Oscar nomination for Best Picture, because to be perfectly honest I didn't think this movie was that great. In fact, I'd sum up the first half, which revolves around young Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) as confusing at best, with a direction and purpose that was mystifying - at least to me.Hugo is an orphan who lives in the clock tower of a Paris train station (unknown to the authorities.) He steals to survive, desperately tries to stay out of the reach of the authorities, who are represented by the Station Inspector (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) and the only thing he has left from his father is an 'automaton' - a sort of robot that doesn't work anymore, but that Hugo wants to fix, because he's convinced that it bears a message from his father. Together with Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) - whose parents have also died and who lives with her godparents (the aforementioned Papa Georges and Mama Jeanne, played by Helen McCrory) - he manages to fix the automaton, which proceeds to draw him a picture from 'A Trip To The Moon' - the first movie he ever saw with his father. This finally leads them to the realization that Papa Georges is Georges Melies, and the story becomes an attempt to help Georges overcome his own demons from the past.Bluntly, I found this confusing and poorly paced. It has very much a fantasy feel about it at times, and I thought for a while (because I didn't know who the director was) that this may have been directed by Tim Burton - it has a very Burton-esque style to it in places (particularly the depiction of the inner workings of the clock.) I was surprised at the closing credits to discover that the movie was actually directed by Martin Scorsese, but as I watched the credits, some of that style finally made sense to me. One of the co-producers of the movie is Johnny Depp - who is, of course, a frequent collaborator as an actor with Tim Burton. OK. The pieces began to fit together. Give the movie credit for some effective special effects (in particular Hugo's two dream scenes revolving around the train and as he sees himself as an automaton), and for a heartwarming ending, as Melies is finally honoured for his film-making achievements. It was also nice to see (not enough, unfortunately) some clips from some of his movies. Some of the memories Melies shares also provide a tantalizing glimpse of early film-making techniques. Yes, there are some good things to be found here. I still found it very difficult to get through the first hour, which was slow-paced and confusing to say the least. It picks up steam after that, and becomes more interesting, but it's still hard to get past that first hour. (4/10)",4,2,6,26 February 2012
U-571," A Perfect 10 In Every Way
","I was glued to the edge of my seat from the start to the finish of this magnificent account of the crew of a US Navy submarine given the mission of boarding a German U-Boat in World War II to capture a top-secret German coding device known as 'Enigma.'This movie is action-packed and full of suspense. A dull moment never intrudes on your enjoyment of it. Matthew McConnaughy is brilliant as Lieutenant Andrew Tyler. In addition to the sheer excitement of the mission, McConnaughy is the central figure in the coming-of-age subplot. Tyler, Executive Officer of the US sub, was denied a command of his own because his captain (played by Bill Paxton) felt that, when push came to shove, he would be unable to order men to die when necessary. When the captain is killed during the mission, Tyler has to take command and overcome his shortcomings to save as many of the crew as he can. Harvey Keitel offers a strong performance as Chief Engineer Klough, a Navy veteran who has doubts about Tyler's ability, and serves as something of a father-figure to him. Keitel's best scene is undoubtedly his confrontation with Tyler after a particularly powerful display of Tyler's self-doubt. 'Don't you ever say `I don't know' again,' he says. 'The captain always knows - even when he doesn't.'Marvelous performances, great directing by Jonathon Mostow who gives the viewer the feel of being on the sub, and a wonderful original score by Richard Marvin all add up to make this the finest movie I've seen in a long time. Recommended for anyone who wants to have some excitement in their lives.A perfect 10.",10,1,9,5 May 2001
The Shining," A Very Good Movie That Could Have Been Great
","Wasted potential bothers me - whether in a person or in a movie. It bothers me here. I want to love this movie. I want to think it's a masterpiece. But it misses that height by just a little bit because while it's very good, it could have been great.There's a great story here that could have worked so well. Jack Nicholson is Jack Torrance, a writer who finds the perfect opportunity. He's going to take his wife and young son (Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd respectively) off to a secluded resort in the Colorado Rockies for the winter. They'll be the only ones there; Jack will work as the custodian and have all sorts of time for writing too. But the unexpected happens. Jack has writers' block. Anyone who writes for a living knows how frustrating that can be. Combined with the seclusion of the resort, Jack begins to slowly drift into insanity, with repercussions for the whole family. If that had been the story, this would have been a great movie; a masterpiece - simply because it's so plausible. Unfortunately ...Well, Stephen King (who wrote the book that this is based on) felt the need to take a story that would have been absolutely chilling because of its plausibility and turn it into some sort of rather silly supernatural/psychic adventure. It seems that Danny has visions and hears voices, etc., etc. The focus keeps coming off Nicholson's descent into insanity and back to this psychic bit, which makes the whole thing nothing more than a flight of fancy, when it could have been bitingly real. Combined with an ending that was - to me at least - the epitome of anti-climax, this movie really lost a lot in my estimation.Don't get me wrong. It's a very good movie. The performances are excellent. Jack Nicholson was born to play parts like this, and he is superb here. Shelley Duvall is convincing as his increasingly terrified wife, and Danny Lloyd does well - even though I wasn't sold on his character's psychic abilities. It was a pleasure to see Scatman Crothers in a supporting role as Dick Hallorann, the resort's chef who shares Danny's psychic ability. I've always liked Scatman Crothers. Stanley Kubrick does a magnificent job of building suspense. You will be on the edge of your seat throughout, and time and time again you will think something is about to happen, except that more often than not nothing happens, so you just start to get comfortable when you suddenly get shocked. This is one of Kubrick's best in my opinion.Watch this. It's a very good movie. It simply could have been better and more believable.7/10 (would have been a 9 if it had been told straight without the psychic nonsense.)",7,1,3,24 August 2002
American Beauty," Best Picture? Hardly! Good Picture? Yeah!
","Dark, frequently disturbing and sometimes humourous. Those are the thoughts that jump to mind as I reflect on this picture. 'American Beauty' deals with the tragic consequences that flow from the intersecting of the disfunctional lives of a group of very strange people.The movie opens with a shot of a video in which Jane Burnham (played by Thora Birch in a forgettable performance) wishes for her father Lester's death. Lester then becomes the narrator, for lack of a better word, of the rest of the story. We know from the start how this is going to end. Jane wants Dad dead, and Lester tells us that this is the story of how he ends up dead. No mystery there. As the story progresses we discover that there are various reasons why virtually all the characters in this movie might want him dead, and we get involved in a decent enough who-dun-it.
The movie has its problems, however. I found it difficult to make much sense of the story for most of the 2 hours. Particularly troublesome was watching a movie about a bunch of people who are completely unlikable; you will feel no empathy for any of these characters and you really won't care much what happens to any of them. Having said that, there is, even at those points where the movie doesn't seem to be making much sense, something vaguely compelling about it. You keep watching, even though you don't much care about these people. The story moves along at a good pace and doesn't seem to bog down at all. Annette Benning gives a good performance as Lester's less than lovable wife Carolyn, and Chris Cooper is over the top as Colonel Frank Fitts, the hard as nails, apparently homophobic father of Jane's love interest.So, there are a lot of good things about this movie. The publicity around it, which focussed largely on the relationship between Lester and his daughter's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), is a bit misleading. That relationship is actually no more important than any of the others to the story, and receives no more screen time than the others. The older man-young girl emphasis seems to me to have been bait to catch people's attention. It worked obviously. 'American Beauty' won an undeserved - in my opinion - Academy Award as Best Picture, when it was up against far superior competition. None of that should detract from the fact that this is a decent enough movie, though. I rated it at 7/10.",7,0,1,24 March 2001
Over the Hedge," It Didn't Blow Me Away
","I chuckled a few times at some of the funnier moments in this movie (which says something right there - the funniest moments could only get a chuckle out of me), became quickly tired of the rather preachy satire of suburban life which reminds us all of the ridiculousness of human wastefulness, and frankly found that the story revolving around RJ the Racoon was unoriginal and bland.Essentially RJ has ripped off Vincent the bear by stealing his food, and Vincent gives him a week to replace it - or else! RJ enlists the unwitting aid of a group of animals led by Verne the turtle to raid the human suburb on the other side of the hedge by sharing stories of the decadence of human society and how everything revolves around food, with much of it ending up in the garbage, and telling them that the food is for them, but really with the plan to use their sweat to get himself off the hook with the bear. In the end RJ learns the requisite valuable lesson about family and how they support each other.It's hard to say who this film was really directed at. The cute animal characters seem to make it a kiddy film, with the moral message and the RJ/Vincent situation seemingly being more understood by adults. In the end, I didn't think either audience would be truly blown away by this, in spite of some very good animation and an excellent cast of voices. Overall, I thought it was a mediocre movie. 4/10",4,0,2,11 April 2008
The Alamo," Perhaps The Worst Historical Re-Enactment Ever
","Historical re-enactment movies are usually worth watching if for no other reason than the fact that the events they're re-enacting are always interesting. You wouldn't make a movie about something that wasn't interesting. But The Alamo fails entirely. From moment one it failed to engage me. It's long winded, often without need, and it includes precious little action or excitement. I realize, of course, that the point here may well have been not so much the battle as the attempt to capture the spirit of the drive for Texan independence, and the desire to be freed from the oppressive Mexican regime, but still, it has to include something interesting. Even the battle scenes seem rushed and less than authentic. A major, major disappointment. 1/10",1,4,12,6 April 2009
Judgment at Nuremberg," Questions Without Answers - Which Is The History Of Nazi Germany
","Lacking the big names of what people normally think of as the 'Nuremberg Trials' - the trial of Nazi leaders such as Goering, Hess and Speer - this movie focuses on the lesser known people who were tried for war crimes: the German judges whose responsibility it was to dispense 'justice' in Hitler's Germany. Although the big names are missing, the movie is powerful and masterfully deals with the troubling questions around Nazism: how could normally good, decent people (represented in this movie by Ernst Janning, played by Burt Lancaster, on trial with three others) have allowed themselves to be sucked into the evil that was Hitler and National Socialism? How could the German people have turned a blind eye to what was going on and simply denied all responsibility? And the movie also considers a troubling question about the United States: if Nazism was evil enough to have warranted a war and then all the effort of the Nuremberg trials, why were the Americans suddenly so willing to 'forgive and forget' with the onset of the Cold War and the threat of communism?The implication here is that the Americans never really took the secondary trials seriously. A second-rate judge (Dan Haywood, available only because he had been defeated in an election, and played magnificently by Spencer Tracy) was appointed to head the trial, the Army was putting pressure on the prosecution to go lightly. It's an amazing fact of history that within three years of the end of World War II, the feeling was so clearly against pursuing those who had played roles in the Nazi nightmare (and, of course, it's a question that still haunts us today as Nazi war criminals from time to time turn up and the response of the public is often, 'he's an old man. Why bother?')Focussing largely on the trial itself, the movie is consistently gripping throughout, and even the diversions outside the courtroom (such as the relationship between Judge Haywood and Mrs. Bertholt -Marlene Dietrich) don't detract from the suspense, as they continue to push the question: 'how can you just sit there and deny knowing anything?' Anyone with an interest in the puzzle of Nazi Germany should watch this. In the end, it raises a lot of questions and offers few answers, but that may be the legacy of Nazism. But the movie makes its point. As Judge Janning talks to Judge Haywood at the end of the movie he says almost pleadingly, 'we never knew it would go so far.' Haywood simply responds, 'Herr Janning, it went that far the first time you convicted a man you knew was innocent.' Powerful stuff.10/10",10,4,5,3 June 2002
Salt," Angelina Jolie Pulls This Off!
","I confess that I went into this with doubts about Angelina Jolie's ability to be believable in this role - but I have to admit that my doubts were wrong. She pulled off the role of Evelyn Salt absolutely perfectly. Evelyn was an American child raised in Russia after the death of her parents, who worked for the U.S. Embassy. Trained to be a Soviet agent, she was repatriated to the United States as part of a Soviet plot to bring the United States to its knees at an undefined future date, and eventually (and, yes, too conveniently, ends up as a CIA agent, exactly as the Soviets had planned for her). Apparently the demise of the Soviet Union didn't result in the demise of the plot, which is eventually put into action and leads to a movie that - in addition to the great performance by Jolie - has sustained excitement, a lot of tension, plot twists galore and a completely bewildering cast of characters, of whom you can never be sure which are the good guys and which are the bad guys. In short, you're guessing all the way through this and really you have no way of knowing exactly how this is going to end.There are several truly unsettling moments scattered throughout this. Perhaps the two that stood out for me were the opening sequence in which Evelyn is tortured by the North Koreans after she's arrested as an American spy, and the scene in which Evelyn has to watch her husband die without being able to help him (and, indeed, having to pretend that she was completely unfeeling about it). The movie has some excellent action scenes scattered throughout. Yes, many of them are rather unbelievable (the scenes in which she jumps from truck to truck to truck to escape her CIA pursuers, and that where she takes over the police van stand out to me) - but that is, after all, the nature of the action genre. There's also a lot of pretty typical shootout action - which again means pretty unbelievable as Evelyn takes out pretty much everyone, but it's all well choreographed and truly exciting, and again it's the nature of the genre.I don't know if there's a plan for a sequel, but the ending of the movie certainly sets us up for a potential sequel. I'd watch it. This was a truly enjoyable, exciting and unpredictable movie. (9/10)",9,2,4,31 March 2011
The Patriot," History Took A Holiday
","Hmmmm. Set in 1776 in South Carolina. There's a war going on. Names like Cornwallis and Washington are included. Sounds like a movie about the American Revolution. Too bad there's almost nothing here about the American Revolution.This is an overhyped, jingoistic example of American film-making at its very worst! Remember the 'Evil Empire' Ronald Reagan spoke about in the 1980's? Folks, the Soviet Union looks positively angelic compared to the demonized British portrayed here. OK. I know that Americans routinely portray the British as being a lot worse than they really were (elsewise, how would they justify the rebellion, which had nothing really to do with 'freedom' properly defined and everything to do with taxes?) But this was ridiculous. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when Ben Martin (Mel Gibson) comes running out of his burning house looking vaguely like an 18th century Rambo. Or when little Susan (Skye McComb Bartusiak) cries out in anguish 'Papa! Papa! I'll say anything you want! Just don't go, papa!' And I loved the beginning, as the 'mailman' delivers the package to the black woman at Martin's house and politely smiles and responds 'you're welcome,' to her 'thank you.' This is South Carolina in 1776. I doubt a white man would have been so polite. Of course there's a lot of violence, and the nasty old British kill a whole lot of innocent people. Blah blah blah! By the way, this has to have been one of Mel Gibson's sorrier performances. He came across as wooden to me all the way through.What frightens me is that a lot of Americans are going to watch this and actually think that they learned something about the American Revolution!

","'Edward Scissorhands' is another example of Tim Burton's rather quirky style of mixing humour with horror (in a Goth sort of way) and ending up with a pretty good movie when it's all put together. When I thought about this movie, one of the things that came through was how heavily influenced by the story of Frankenstein it is. Edward (very effectively played by Johnny Depp) isn't a real person, he's a creation of an unnamed scientist (played in basically a cameo role by Vincent Price.) Like Frankenstein's monster, he's basically isolated. Like the monster, when he's removed from his isolation, he ends up wreaking unintentional havoc. Maybe the most obvious comparison is when the people of the town storm the castle he lives in, much like the villagers stormed Frankenstein's castle. (Much of the action in the town actually reminded me of 'Desperate Housewives,' with everything happening on the same street and a bunch of women being in the know about it all.)The first half of the movie is a fun, whimsical sort of fantasy as Edward tries to adjust to life outside his castle. He becomes the hit of the town (especially with the women.) Some of this is wonderfully funny. Gradually, though, the movie turns progressively darker and even violent as Edward runs into more and more trouble. The gradual shift in tone was very effectively accomplished by Burton, and pulled off well by the cast (especially Depp.) It did, however, represent a bit of a problem for me. The opening of the movie tells us that this story is a bedtime story told by Kim (played by Winona Ryder) to her granddaughter about an event long ago, to explain where snow comes from. I wouldn't think of the darker half of this movie as a good bedtime story for a young girl! That caused me a bit of trouble, as did the fact that no one ever explained why Edward had scissors for hands. I understand that The Inventor (as he was called in the credits) died before he could give him hands, but why would he have fashioned these clunky looking scissor-type hands for him in the first place? Unanswered questions aside, I throughly enjoyed watching this (although I thought the fluffy fantasy was more enjoyable than the descent into darkness) and thought that the entire cast really pulled off a collection of good performances.

Silver Linings Playbook," Great Performances In A Story Of No Great Note
","Bradley Cooper is wonderful. About that there can be no argument. He captured the character and the essence of Pat Solitano perfectly. Solitano is recently released from a psychiatric hospital, suffering bipolar disorder and after having beaten up the man he found in the shower with his wife. Released at the insistence of his mother (Jackie Weaver) and against the advice of doctors, Pat has to try to rebuild his life, coping with a none too normal family of his own (including a mildly OCD Philadelphia Eagles fanatic father, played by Robert De Niro.) His fantasy upon release is to win back his wife, who's taken out a restraining order against him. Attempting to reconnect, he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) - a somewhat promiscuous widow who agrees to carry letters between Pat and his wife, who is an acquaintance of hers. Meanwhile, Pat and Tiffany discover a shared love of dance. Pat thinks that doing well in a dance competition will show his wife that he's back to normal. That's the movie is a nutshell. And I have to say that I don't get the hype. It did very little for me.Yes. It features good performances. Cooper, Weaver, De Niro and Lawrence are all quite good. But they really can't turn the basic story into anything more than what it is - a completely predictable couple of hours that features absolutely no surprise in the end, and that seems far too easily to solve all of Pat and Tiffany's personal challenges. Sure it's mildly humorous at times. Pat going jogging while wearing a garbage bag as a vest made me smile - the first time I saw it. By the 35th time (or whatever) it was just a part of the movie and drew no response.My biggest beef with this I think was the way it started. There was no real exploration of the character or his past. Yes, that gets revealed as the movie goes on, but somehow I would have liked just a little more of an introduction. Instead, all we got was Pat's mom showing up at the psych hospital and demanding that he be released. I wanted to know a little more about this guy before getting into the rest of the story.Sure, it has good performances from pretty much everyone. but the basic story disappoints.",3,4,8,12 May 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Fine Performance From Rooney Mara In A Strangely Incoherent Movie
","The highlight of this film is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Lisbeth is an investigator who gets involved in what becomes a serial murder mystery from many years before. Lisbeth is a complex character. She's troubled and mysterious, deeply vulnerable and yet surprisingly strong at the same time; qualities all brought out effectively by her appearance (strange hair styles and multiple piercings) and by an often distant look about her - a sort of detachment perhaps quite believable for a character with her history. Mara captured the contradictions of the character perfectly. Although I have to admit that I wasn't that taken with the movie as a whole, I was drawn to Lisbeth; I cared about her. I hurt when she hurt. The scenes between Lisbeth and Nils (Yorick van Waginingen) - both those in which she was being abused and the scene in which she took her revenge (and even the brief later scene in the elevator) - were powerful and disturbing. I've not felt that attached to a character in a long while, so kudos to Mara for drawing out such a reaction - especially since, as I said, she managed to do it in a movie that just didn't appeal to me very much.The overall story was not unlike the character of Lisbeth - strange and confusing and complex and mysterious, but on the whole it failed to connect with me in the way the character of Lisbeth did. And, as much as I was drawn to the character, part of the problem with the story was that so much of it revolved around Lisbeth. The rape/revenge scenes may have been powerful and disturbing, but they didn't really seem to connect that well with the main point of the movie, which was the search for the serial killer's identity, and the one victim of Harriet in particular. To me, it seemed almost as if director David Fincher realized that the story he was telling was almost totally lacking in coherence. That basic incoherence (or even unattractiveness) was well summed up by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Speaking with Mikael (Daniel Craig) - who he's asked to look into the disappearance of his niece Harriet many years before - he explains the bewildering nature of his relatives (a bunch consisting of some Nazis and neo-Nazis and some who won't speak to them because they're Nazis and neo-Nazis) and when Mikael tells him that he's having trouble keeping everything straight, Henrik responds, 'Soon you'll know us all too well, with my apologies.' A point for honesty I guess. There's little in this story or in its characters that's either pleasant or attractive so Fincher seems to have chosen to over-emphasize Lisbeth's troubles (the one strong part of the script) - the problem being that this one strong part of the script wasn't essential to the story. Very strange to me.In any event, the movie really lost me right from the start with a bizarre opening sequences and musical score that lasted far, far too long, and it never really drew me consistently back in. Kudos to Rooney Mara for a fine performance, but the movie overall was quite lacking. (3/10)",3,12,19,22 February 2012
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Total Nonsense
","Apparently the United States Army really did try to do some of the things depicted here. For some reason that doesn't surprise me. Apparently they really did try to get soldiers to kill goats with their minds, walk through walls, etc. (And apparently they did at one point torture captured Iraqis by making them watch videos of Barney the Dinosaur over and over - that I can understand!) That much of the story is true. A serious look at some of those efforts might have actually been worthwhile - and given how ridiculous the stuff is, might actually have been funny (much funnier than this, which at times managed to be at best slightly funny) even if it was treating the subject matter seriously. This was not serious. This movie takes those experiments as the jumping off point for a ridiculous story that put me to sleep at one point and never managed to pull me back in. The movie is shown largely from the perspective of a reporter (Ewen McGregor) who heads to Iraq to prove how tough he is I guess and somehow ends up connecting with this guy Lyn (George Clooney) - who was at one time one of the 'psychic soldiers' of the experiment. OK. I'm not much of a George Clooney fan. Strike 1 on the movie. The story was impossible to follow - largely incoherent at times. Strike 2. The characters were unbelievable to the point of being nonsensical. Strike 3. I could go on with the problems, but - you know - 3 strikes and you're out!",2,4,10,21 August 2010
Shrek Forever After," No Better Than OK
","I'm not in particular an aficionado of the Shrek series. I saw the first one and enjoyed it, but haven't actually seen 2 or 3. My daughter, though, loves Shrek, and so we went to see the fourth and final instalment tonight. Although the first movie was enjoyable enough, I was frankly tired enough of the lovable ogre when it was over that I didn't want to watch him again, and by now apparently Shrek feels that way too! In this movie, he's tired of the whole lovable ogre image and wants to return to the times when he was feared as an ogre, and he works out a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to allow him to do just that, but he hadn't considered that with his brand new life came the loss of his old life - including his family and friends. Fiona no longer knows him and, of course, their children don't exist. Not even Donkey knows who he is, and the world is a pretty bleak place in this new life. Rumpelstiltskin has taken over Far Far Away from Fiona's parents and all the ogres are imprisoned. In this sense, the movie has a bit of similarity to 'It's A Wonderful Life.' Obviously, the point of the movie is to put things right.This was no better than OK. Not having seen Parts 2 and 3, I can't really compare them, but it's certainly less fun than the first movie. My daughter - the Shrek fan - enjoyed it, but also found some parts quite scary, and it is a rather heavy movie at times. There's a revolving door of fairy tale characters, of course - Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, the Ginger Bread Man, Puss In Boots, etc. I suppose the message was good - learn to appreciate the life you have, because the alternative might not be that pleasing. As a farewell to the series (as I understand it there are no more Shrek movies planned) I didn't really see any particular closure involved with this - it didn't seem like a good way to say good-bye to the characters. Surely that was a serious missed opportunity.",5,1,3,10 June 2010
Collateral," A Pretty Decent Action-Suspense Thriller
","Highlighted by great performance from Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise, this is a movie that holds your attention and basically picks up steam as it goes along, leading to a pretty good last half hour as Cruise's Vincent stalks his last victim, and Foxx's Max stalks him in return. The plot was intriguing enough. Max is a cab driver who unwittingly picks up a hit man (Cruise) and is then forced to drive him from hit to hit all over Los Angeles, becoming more and more deeply involved against his will. I enjoyed seeing Cruise in this role. He was rather convincing as the cold as ice, professional hit man who cares not one iota about any of his victims (and he even got to do one of his famous 'Tom Cruise running frantically' scenes!). I also enjoyed the fact that, while there's a lot of violence in this movie, there's also an interesting psychological study of both Max and Vincent: Max the frustrated cab driver who has big dreams, and Vincent as the philosophical and well-cultured sociopath. If there's a weakness to this movie, it revolves around the character of Annie, played by Jada Pinkett Smith. Annie was Max's last passenger before Vincent climbed in. She's also a prosecutor who just happens to be going after the man Vincent has been hired by, and turns out to be Vincent's last target. That was just way too much of a coincidence for this to be truly believable (and, for that matter, it was also very predictable) and while that last half hour involving the three main characters is very suspenseful, it also stretches credibility a bit, as Max gets such a clear view from the street (a fair distance away) of what's happening 14 and 16 floors above him. Annie was also not a particularly believable prosecutor. At the end of the movie (which was itself a bit anti-climactic) she simply leaves the train? She doesn't alert the train's driver about what's happened? She doesn't call the police? What kind of prosecutor is she? Stretches in credibility aside, though, this was a pretty decent couple of hours. 7/10",7,0,1,4 March 2009
Dunkirk," Straightforward And Gritty, But To Me It Missed The Mark Just A Bit
","Director Christopher Nolan offers the viewer a pretty straightforward re-telling of the evacuation of British soldiers from the French port of Dunkirk in May of 1940, as the Germans encircled the town. The story is told from a strictly British perspective. Although we see some German planes involved in battles with RAF fighters as far as I can recall there isn't a single glimpse of a German soldier anywhere. Nolan then tells the story from three perspectives within that British perspective: on the land, on the sea and in the air. The land focuses on the solders awaiting rescue, the sea focuses mostly on the small private boats that made such a huge contribution to the effort (focusing on one boat in particular) and the air focuses on the battle by a small number of RAF pilots to protect their compatriots beneath against German planes. That structure was a bit confusing at first (especially as it was captioned on screen) but the story makes sense and that odd narrative structure is only a brief distraction.There's not really a main character involved in this. The point seems to have been to portray the breadth of the Dunkirk evacuation at the expense of character depth. There's also no one moment that seems truly central, which means that the movie strikes you in the end of not really having built up to anything (aside from the actual evacuation, which admittedly is the most important thing.) But in some respects that made this movie seem at times less of a drama and more of a docu-drama if that makes any sense. The story-telling was a little bit lacking. I did appreciate that while the heroism of the British soldiers was front and centre, there was no shying away from a few more negative portrayals - shell-shocked soldiers, soldiers who just didn't want to fight anymore, soldiers who wouldn't even help their French allies. In that sense, this had a somewhat gritty feel, as befits a war movie.It's not a bad movie. To me, it just missed the mark a little bit in terms of what I was expecting. (6/10)",6,2,3,2 November 2019
Cross of Iron," On The Russian Front In 1943
","A fine movie, made even more interesting by the fact that it's one of the few movies ('Das Boot' would be another example) that depicts the Second World War strictly from the German perspective, 'Cross of Iron' is notable for the performances from a strong collection of actors, headlines by James Coburn as Sgt. Steiner. Steiner leads a German platoon at the Russian Front in 1943, a time when the Germans haven't yet lost the war, but they're definitely on the road to defeat. Steiner is the winner of an Iron Cross, and he comes under the command of Capt. Stransky (another fine performance by Maximilian Schell), a Prussian officer so desperate to impress his family that he'll readily lie in order to return from the Front with his own Iron Cross. Steiner is a fascinating character; a bit of a loner, who holds his officers in contempt as well as 'the stinking Party' and whose only real commitment seems to be to the platoon he leads. For Steiner, the romance of war (if it ever existed) has long since been shattered. Any idealistic view of why he's fighting is gone - he fights now simply 'for survival.' The movie seems a little bit disjointed at times, and, like many war movies, eventually the battle scenes start to seem like a bit too much of the same thing over and over again - which, of course, is probably why soldiers are able to persevere through war. Still, it's a fascinating look at the cynicism bred by war. 7/10",7,4,5,8 July 2008
The Machinist," A Lot Of Mystery But Still A Bizarre Movie That Didn't Really Pull Me In
","Through the opening scenes of the movie, I for some reason immediately thought of 'American Psycho' - probably because of Christian Bale and the whole prostitute angle. Then, when it was revealed that Trevor (Bale) hadn't slept for a year (and was obviously losing his grip on reality) I started thinking of 'Insomnia.' The problem with a movie that makes me think of those two movies is that I didn't care for either one! Same with this. It just didn't hit home with me.Bale's performance was good. He certainly nailed the part of Trevor - a guy who's obviously going off the deep end and becoming increasingly paranoid. There's also no question that there's enough mystery involved in this as we try to piece together the increasingly bizarre things that are happening in Trevor's life and to come up with an explanation for them. Those two things together mean that this certainly isn't an awful movie, but it also doesn't come anywhere close to the heights of greatness that some seem to have assigned to it. The strong points aside, the story didn't really work that well for me. I had trouble getting into it at the beginning, and even once the mystery finally grabbed me, my own feeling was that there were just too many twists and turns, too much bizarre-ness, and nothing that would even give the viewer a hint of the ultimate solution to the mystery, which eliminated the fun of trying to figure the thing out, which means that the ending certainly came as a surprise to me. Personally, though, I prefer to be surprised because I've figured the mystery out incorrectly, not because there was nothing to allow me to try to figure the mystery out! My own feeling was that it was what might be described as 'upper-mediocre.' 4/10",4,2,5,16 December 2009
Aliens," Ridley Scott's Directing Was Missed
","Right off the top the movie made me shake my head with one of those 'it's just too convenient' moments. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) - the only survivor from the first movie - is finally rescued by a salvage ship after being in 'hyper-sleep' for 57 years. OK. She tries to brief the company that sent her and her team on the first mission on the dangerous aliens they encountered, but no one will believe her story. Why not? Because there have been human colonists on the planet now for over 20 years and there hasn't been a single report of a problem. Well, we know where this is headed, don't we. Now that Ripley's back all of a sudden contact with the colony is lost, which allows the company to send Ripley back to the planet to do battle with the aliens all over again. Apparently they were waiting for her to be found!Setting aside that moment of ultra-convenience, this movie is weaker than the original in the series. James Cameron took over the directing duties in this from Ridley Scott, and Scott's touch was missed. What made the first movie very effective was the shadowy nature of the aliens. Scott never really gave us a good look at them. They were shadowy figures which made the story quite suspenseful. Cameron dispenses with that idea completely. The aliens are front and centre once the team reaches the planet, and somehow that makes this movie less frightening than its original. Cameron (who also co-wrote the screenplay) also turns this into a pretty standard humans vs. aliens shoot out with lots of weapons and lots of explosions, etc. The characters in this seemed more one dimensional than those in the original. So you have an out of control Marine (Bill Paxton), an in control Marine (William Hope) and the requisite bad guy representing the company (Paul Reiser). Then of course there's Ripley who, while being far more aggressive here than in the original, also gets to explore her maternal side as she becomes a surrogate mother figure to Newt (Carrie Henn) - a little girl who's apparently the only survivor among the colonists. The scene in which Ripley holds the little girl tight as the alien is approaching and says to her 'close your eyes, baby' is actually a virtual reshoot of a scene in which a mother comforts her daughter as a monster approaches them in a 1957 movie called 'The Monster Who Challenged The World.' And - wow - can Newt ever scream when scary things happen!No. I wasn't especially impressed with this movie, although I did get a laugh near the end, when Ripley appeared to do battle with the aliens inhabiting that big robot-like suit swinging away at the creatures without mercy, and I suddenly realized that - hey - that's where James Cameron got the idea for the same kind of suits the Marines used in 'Avatar!'",3,14,30,21 February 2011
The Exorcist," Not Bad; Just Overhyped
","It's hard to believe the furor that was apparently caused when this movie was first released. I was just 10 years old at the time and never saw it in the theatres, and, in fact, only just recently saw it for the first time. It struck me as a pretty standard horror movie about a young girl possessed by the devil. I didn't find it shocking or horrific, and have seen movies that were far more frightening than this.The highlight of the movie, I would say, was the absolutely brilliant performance by young Linda Blair as the possessed Regan. She has apparently said over the years that this movie was the end of any real acting career for her, because she became so deeply associated with this character in the public imagination. That's the price, I guess, when your first movie performance is so brilliant and so controversial. With no body of work before to balance it, Linda Blair became Regan MacNeil. Jason Miller was effective as Father Damien, but was overshadowed by Blair. It was also, I thought, a good study of a priest who had become a psychologist more than a theologian (far too common in all Christian denominations, even today.) Max Von Sydow's performance as Father Merrin (called in by the Church to confront the demon) was quite good.I got lost a bit in the beginning of this movie, which dealt with some of Merrin's background, and there was also no real explanation of how this girl got possessed (which, however, is probably making a point: evil can strike anywhere for no obvious reason.)In the end, I just found this to be a decent horror movie, but I didn't think there was anything spectacular about it. 6/10",6,16,29,6 March 2004
Gandhi," This May Well Be The Best Bio-Pic Ever Made
","Do not be put off by the length of this movie. At a little over 3 hours it is a rather long movie, but it's wonderfully made, surprisingly accurate and never dull. It also deals with one of the more fascinating figures in history - Mohandas Gandhi (or the Mahatma) - a Hindu disciple of non-violence and human equality who was one of the leading figures in the movement for the independence of India, and who - as many have suggested - was (even as a Hindu) a better disciple of Jesus' teachings than most professing Christians are. Gandhi is a fascinating character, and a wholly appropriate subject for a film of this length and depth.I give credit to Richard Attenborough, who was both the director and the producer of this film. In an opening written message, he acknowledges that no movie can do justice to a man's entire life, and that his hope is to be able to offer at look at the heart of the man. In that he succeeded admirably. After the shocking opening sequence that depicts Gandhi's tragic assassination at the hands of a Hindu militant who objected to his attempts to reach out to Muslims, we are transported immediately to Gandhi's early career in South Africa. Arriving as a lawyer to assist in a case, he's introduced immediately to the racial realities of South Africa, and he becomes a leader in the struggle for racial equality in that country (at the time, a part of the British Empire.) At that point in his life, Gandhi is a figure of a more cultured, upper-class Indian (or 'coloured' in South African parlance) and he has a great commitment to the British Empire and a pride in being a citizen of the Empire. He trusts the Empire and its system to look out for his people's interests. He also works out his essential philosophy of non-violent resistance in South Africa. The South African part of the movie is a backdrop to the more important story of Gandhi's work in India, but it's vital to understanding who he was - and who he became.Gandhi arrives in India just at the beginning of the First World War - at a time when the movement for an independent India was just getting off the ground. He becomes committed to that cause, and increasingly disenchanted with the British authorities, but always remains a disciple of non-violence. He associated with the lowest of the low - the 'untouchables' of the Hindu caste system (even dressing like them, or even more modestly than them) - and he tries to maintain unity and friendship between Hindus and Muslims, believing both to be essential to India's future. In India we see his campaign of non-co- operation with the British, which tragically dissolves into violence toward the British (which is only stopped when Gandhi goes on a fast, vowing to starve unless peace is restored) and then we get a fair bit of background about the Salt March, as Indians join with Gandhi to illegally make salt in their own country - where salt was under a crown monopoly.Finally, the movie portrays the debates around Indian independence, and the ultimate tragedy of a divided India rapidly dissolving into religiously motivated violence, as the country ends up divided between Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan, before finishing once again with the portrayal of Gandhi's assassination.One might quibble, I suppose, with the casting of Ben Kingsley as Gandhi rather than using one of the many very talented Indian actors in the role, but clearly Hollywood wanted a 'name' - someone familiar to American audiences. And even if one quibbles with the choice of Kingsley, one cannot quibble with his performance. He was perfect in the role; he became Gandhi in this picture. Indeed, as Attenborough suggested was his goal at the start of the movie, Kingsley captured for us the heart of the man. The other performances faded into the background in comparison with Kingsley's. I was a bit surprised by (of all things) the credits that rolled at the end of the movie. Actors who played (in the overall scheme of things) minor characters (like Americans Martin Sheen and Candice Bergen and Brits John Gielgud and Trevor Howard) were given credit ahead of the actors who played truly important figures such as Nehru (Roshan Seth) and Jinnah (Alyque Padamsee). I found it a bit disturbing (and perhaps not in keeping with the heart of Gandhi) that the 'ethnic' actors who were truly central to the story seemed to be given second place behind American and British actors in lesser roles.I can't really bring myself to mark the movie down for that indiscretion, though. This is a marvellous movie - possibly the best bio-pic ever made. (10/10)",10,2,4,26 January 2012
American History X," Powerful, Disturbing And Often Brutal - This Makes Its Point
","Offering both a very disturbing look at the inside workings of a neo- Nazi skinhead group, as well as a powerful reflection on the redemption of one of its former leaders, this is a truly powerful movie that is both disturbing and sobering. Much to my surprise, it was quite fast-paced and never seemed to lose itself in moralizing or philosophizing, although the temptation was there. The story revolves around an assignment given to a local white teenager by his black principal. The teen (Edward Furlong), whose brother was the former skinhead trying to go straight after doing time in prison, had written a book review expressing admiration for Mein Kampf. His principal (Avery Brooks) assigned him to write the story of his brother, focusing on its social significance. That angle could, as I said, have led to a lot of moralizing. Instead, it served as a springboard to a very powerful series of flashbacks detailing the brother's growing involvement in the movement and his experiences in prison that led to him turning around, as well as a bit of the story of him going straight upon his release. The brother was brilliantly played by Edward Norton. The movie is very brutal and violent at times and is frankly not for the faint of heart. It also seems that a lot happens as a result of one assignment that, as I understood the story, had to be done in one night.Director Tony Kaye made a good decision to film parts of the movie in black and white, which made a powerful statement in itself of the danger of seeing things in simplistic terms. In the end, this isn't a movie that simply attacks the white skinhead movement. It points out the problem of hate for the sake of hate, and, while focusing on the skinhead movement, the point is applicable when applied to black gang bangers or Latino gangs or any other race-based or religion-based hate movement. Hatred is a waste of time and energy - ultimately, hatred is a waste of life, a point powerfully made in the last scenes of the movie. This movie will not leave you feeling good - but that isn't its purpose. It will leave you with an understanding of the pointlessness of living by hate. 8/10",8,0,2,2 February 2010
Ocean's Eleven," An Uninspired Remake Of An Uninspired Original
","I was not a huge lover of the original version of 'Ocean's Eleven,' but would still give it the nod over this rather weak and uninspired remake. Basically what makes this the weaker of the two is the cast. In the original, there was the chemistry of the 'Rat Pack' to at least keep things interesting. Here, George Clooney et. al. are never able to establish that same rapport and a movie that boasts some big names (Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, etc.) is never able to convince me that the cast was working as a team.The same problem that infected the first version is apparent in this as well: the plodding beginning which takes us in great detail through the planning of the casino heist. Here, though, the planning itself leads to questions. To do everything that this bunch did in preparation would have required (it seems to me) a fair bit of seed money. Sure, $160 million is a lot of money, but I found myself wondering at times why they needed it. In any event, the planning of the heist is not exactly spell-binding. This version goes into far more detail about the heist itself than did the original, but it loses points for its ending, which was quite weak compared to the 'Rat Pack' version.Since I wasn't a fan of the original I wasn't really expecting much, and that's exactly what I got: not much!3/10.",3,1,4,6 January 2003
Pearl Harbor," Stick With It - The Wait Is Worth It
","This is two movies in one, and almost forces anyone trying to review it to divide it into two parts.You have to have some serious 'stick-to-it-iveness' to make this work for you. The first hour and a half or so is all about the love story between Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). The most generous thing I can say about this is that it is excruciating. The romance is never really fleshed out. It appears almost out of the blue and seems to move in a stuttering way that doesn't make a lot of sense. I didn't think there was much chemistry between Affleck and Beckinsale, or for that matter between Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett, who played Danny - Rafe's best friend and eventual rival for Evelyn's love. Too cliché, and the reason for the conflict between Rafe and Danny is too contrived. This first half gets a 2/10. You will almost be prepared to turn this thing off - until the Japanese attack!Here's where 'Pearl Harbor' begins to shine. Everything you've heard about the special effects contained in this are absolutely true. They are magnificent, and succeed in putting the viewer right into the heart of the battle. The acting still doesn't shine - but it doesn't have to! This is edge of your seat stuff and makes the horribly dull first half worth it. These have got to be some of the most realistic war scenes ever put together by Hollywood. The second half rates an 8/10.A couple of casting notes are in order. Dan Aykroyd as the naval captain who is also the crack decoder just didn't work for me, and Jon Voight - who played President Roosevelt - simply did not capture the part. Overall - no better than average performances, even from the leads. So, let's see. A 2/10 for the first half, and an 8/10 for the second. That averages out to 5/10 - and that seems right to me. Not a glowing endorsement overall, but you will be amazed by the battle scenes.",5,0,3,9 June 2002
Jackie," A So-So Portrayal That Just Didn't Connect With Me
","I was born one day before JFK's assassination. I obviously have no memory of the event, and only the most limited memories of Jackie - and I remember her mostly as Jackie Onassis and not as the First Lady of the United States. I was interested in this movie for historical reasons. The Kennedy assassination is still one that intrigues people. There is, however, little about the actual shooting, aside from a pretty graphic portrayal of the impact of the bullet that hit JFK in the head near the end of the movie. As the title suggests (so it should come as no surprise) the movie is more about Jackie and her response to the shooting. Natalie Portman seemed to do a decent job as the title character, but somehow she just failed to connect with me. Something seemed off to me; something seemed missing. Certainly she captured the shock Jackie must have felt. In a whirlwind of a few days she went from being First Lady of the United States to the president's young widow, having to move out of the White House to make way for Lyndon and Ladybird Johnson, with no real plan for where to go or what to do with the rest of her life. All that came through, but Portman just didn't 'connect' with me. I didn't find myself emotionally drawn in with Jackie, and in this kind of movie that's a definite problem. It's sombre and dark - as it should be. It shows scenes like Jackie wiping JFK's blood off her face. I should have 'felt' something for her plight. And I didn't. That was a problem.I also found it strange that the story kept coming back to the famous 1961 TV tour of the White House that Jackie gave. I didn't think that was a particularly effective means of moving the story along, nor did it reveal much to me about Jackie. It's hard to say exactly what the problem was. Something just seemed missing here. I can't explain it any better than that, but this movie failed to make much of a connection with me. (5/10)",5,0,0,15 April 2017
No Strings Attached," Pointless And Very Predictable
","I will give this movie credit for this: it did actually make me chuckle a few times. There are some amusing moments in it as Emma and Adam (Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher) try to sort out their relationship. Having met as teenagers at a camp, they've reconnected as adults and become 'friends with benefits' - a euphemism, of course, for two people having sex with each other without any commitment. It's hardly an earth shaking premise. It is very much about sex, sex and more sex, and it's very predictable. You know that eventually these two are going to fall for each other in spite of their 'no commitment' commitment, and you guess that in some way they're going to overcome all the obstacles and end up together. So the few chuckles that I did get out of this were very necessary to make the movie bearable.One extra point for it is that there is a twist in this. It's not Emma who falls for Adam; it's Adam who falls for Emma and Emma who tries to brush him off at first. That's a gender role reversal, of course, which I guess also gave this a little bit of flavour that it wouldn't otherwise have had. On the downside, it's burdened with characters (mostly the secondary one but also Emma and Adam to an extent) that you really have trouble caring about. Sure I wanted the two of them to get together, but that was mostly because it would signal the end of the movie. (3/10)",3,1,2,29 July 2012
Tropic Thunder," A Good Spoof Movie
","Because Hollywood sometimes (or often) comes across as far too full of itself, I have always enjoyed the so-called 'spoof' movies, when Hollywood engages in a bit of self-deprecating humour about how silly the whole business can sometimes be. I didn't think that 'Tropic Thunder' was the best spoof movie I've ever seen, but it was pretty good and it did point out some of Hollywood's excesses. Actually, that happened right from the start when we were given a series of fake 'trailers' and 'previews' of movies that starred the actors who were in the fictional 'Tropic Thunder.' I especially enjoyed the trailer for 'Scorcher VI,' starring Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller). How did it go? 'He made a difference five times before. Now he's going to make a difference again. But this time it will be different!' So the movie caught my attention right from the start. The actual story revolves around a collection of stars shooting a movie about the Vietnam War. Convinced that they're not giving it their all, the decision is made to drop the whole bunch of them into the jungle to let them get the feel of the place. It's sort of 'Celebrity Survivor Extreme!' Into the mix comes a drug ring led by a Vietnamese kid who thinks the actors are DEA agents and sets out to eliminate them, but it takes a while for the stars to actually realize this is happening for real.In all honesty, the movie wasn't hilarious. Amusing is probably more the word I would use for it. Stiller was good, as was Jack Black as 'Jeff Portnoy,' but the real gem here was an over the top performance from Robert Downey, Jr as Australian actor and 5 time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus, who is nevertheless so desperate for a part that he undergoes pigment alteration surgery to become a black man. In the words of actor Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson): 'they had one good part in here for a black man and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee!' Downey was superb here in a complicated part: after all, he wasn't a white man playing a black man, he was a white man playing a white man playing a black man! There's a lot of good fun contained in this movie. It may not be the greatest 'spoof' movie ever made, but it's still a pretty good one. 7/10",7,0,1,1 September 2009
Enchanted," A Truly Enchanting Movie; Disney At Its Finest
","In many respects, I think 'Enchanted' will hit home more powerfully with adults than children, although there's really nothing here that children wouldn't love too. It's just that this movie seemed to be a step back in time for Disney, to the stories and animation that I grew up with. While it will represent good entertainment for children, for me it was wonderful nostalgia; Disney the way Disney was meant to be. There are references throughout to the classic Disney stories (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella) and yet the story is refreshingly original with new characters and a plot that is both truly enchanting and hilarious at times.The story starts in the animated story-book land of Andalasia, where Giselle meets her fairy tale Prince Edward and they prepare to be married. Unfortunately, Edward's stepmother Queen Narissa wants to prevent this, as once he marries, he becomes king, and so she banishes Giselle to modern day New York City. Here the movie becomes live action, and follows Giselle (now played brilliantly by Amy Adams) as she tries to come to terms with being lost in this mystifying new world. Here she meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey) - a divorce lawyer who doesn't believe in fairy tales but slowly becomes - well - enchanted with Giselle's sweet innocence. Eventually of course, Edward (James Marsden) comes to find Giselle, followed first by Narissa's henchman Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) and then by Narissa herself (Susan Sarandon). Let's just say that these three animated characters who come to life (along with Pip the Chipmunk, who also makes the journey) turn 21st century New York City on its head.There's little not to like here, although I thought some of the charm was lost once Giselle started to lose some of her innocence and began to accept that life isn't always a fairy tale. That's true, of course, but in all honesty I liked her better as a straight fairy tale character come to life. The song and dance routines in this movie are exceptional, the scenes in which Giselle interacts with New York's wildlife (including pigeons, rats and cockroaches) are delightful and the interplay between the cast members is flawless. You basically know how this is going to turn out pretty early on, although I liked the final twist between Edward and Nancy (Idina Menzel) - Robert's girlfriend. Apparently both Robert and Nancy needed some fairy tale in their lives. It's a great Disney movie. 8/10",8,1,1,10 July 2008
The Usual Suspects," Sometimes A Movie Tries Too Hard
","Featuring a convoluted plot that wanders all over the place, I have to admit that in spite of its high rating here, 'The Usual Suspects' just didn't take hold of me. As a matter of fact, within about the first 10 minutes I was already finding my mind wandering. I don't mind complicated plot lines when they add to a coherent story, but this story simply wasn't that coherent. Five shady characters meet one night in a police lineup and concoct some sort of criminal scheme. There are then so many twists and turns and so many different angles introduced that I found I simply didn't have the energy to keep up with it all.Now, most of the cast (most importantly Kevin Spacey as Kint and Gabriel Byrne as Keaton) did a decent enough job on this. They took it seriously; they were believable in their roles. I just honestly felt that those who came up with the story were trying too hard to keep the viewers off balance, with no idea what was coming next, and to do that they came up with a plot that really just didn't flow all that well.As far as I could see, the greatest strength of the movie came in the last 10 minutes, when the ongoing mystery about the truth about Keyser Soze was finally revealed. (Yes - it does get revealed eventually.) I was glad of this, because it was the one point of an overly-complicated plot that kept me interested. Was this guy real, or was he in fact a piece of fiction? I was glad to see that resolved - and, no, I didn't see the ultimate resolution coming. So, credit for that ending, but the movie as a whole just didn't strike home with me. (4/10)",4,4,7,18 July 2013
Gone with the Wind," An Old Classic That Holds Up Well To The Test Of Time
","I have watched a lot of movies over the years, and yet - as hard as it is to believe - I had never watched 'Gone With The Wind' from beginning to end until now. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it still deserves to be considered a classic, even 62 years after its release.It's true that this movie is far from perfect. It is overly sympathetic to the south, and foolishly romanticizes 'Old Dixie.' Masters and slaves were just one big happy family if you choose to believe this account. (In fairness the screenplay does point out, through the eyes of Rhett Butler, the foolishness of the South even getting into this war, let alone believing that it could actually win the thing.) The Civil War itself seemed to pass at lightning speed, which perhaps contributes to some questionable historical references. For example, reference is made seemingly early in the War to General Lee 'pushing the Yankees out of Virginia.' The problem is that I can't find any reference to Lee commanding troops in battle that early in the War. OK. That's pretty picky perhaps. There is certainly, however, the racist stereotyping of the happy slaves who just wish those damn Yankees would go away and let them go back to their nice, comfortable lives in the fields and slave huts, although that has to be looked at in the context of 1939; there is a very strange lack of southern accents among these Confederates; and, at about 3 and a half hours the movie is inexcusably long. The second half especially drags a little bit and lacks the sustained excitement of the first 90 minutes or so.Having said all that, the negatives definitely do not outweigh the positives. Where to begin? How about the acting! There really isn't a weak performance anywhere, and there are a number of standouts. Is it even possible to imagine anyone but Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh as Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara? These two were superb in these roles. The chemistry between them literally drips from the screen as their complex love-hate relationship is explored. Gable demonstrated great versatility as he moved seamlessly from greedy blockade runner to doting father to abusive husband. Leigh captured the essence of Scarlett perfectly, and was very convincing in her statements of her love for Tara, the family plantation. Hattie McDaniel was great as Mammy - the house slave, and Olivia de Havilland put on a strong performance as Melanie Wilkes, the woman who married Scarlett's true love.I was especially impressed by the special effects in this movie - especially the scenes as Rhett and Scarlett rush through Atlanta's  streets as the city burns down around them. There was also good use of low-key humour scattered throughout, which helped to break some of the dramatic tension in what was for the most part a pretty dark movie.So, yes, even after 62 years, this holds up well. Every movie fan should watch it at least once. I rate it as an 8/10.",8,1,3,4 July 2001
The Butterfly Effect," Bizarre, Bewildering, Disturbing - And Very Good!
","Ashton Kutcher isn't really an actor who appeals to me, so I wasn't really expecting a lot from this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a very good movie - bizarre all the way through and sometimes bewildering, but still very good. Kutcher played the adult Evan Treborn, a troubled young man with a troubled background who has inherited from his father and grandfather some strange ability to move backward in time by focusing on memories recorded in his journal. Unfortunately, both his father and grandfather were considered insane, and people are beginning to suspect the same about Evan. Evan's goal in his time travel seems to be to save his friend Kayleigh (Amy Smart), whose life is devastated by her father's sexual abuse. Unfortunately, every time Evan goes back in time and makes a change that he thinks will help Kayleigh, things get worse, and eventually everything spirals totally out of control. As Evan keeps moving from one reality to another, you begin to lose track of reality yourself while you watch this and there is a point at which you start to think that none of this is real; that Evan really is simply insane.Performances in this movie were pretty good - not outstanding, but good quality. There are a number of troubling and unsettling scenes in this (particularly the dog being set on fire - which thankfully we don't see through to the end) and it certainly isn't an easy movie to watch from an emotional point of view, but it is a compelling movie that never loses its hold. One criticism has to do with the title. 'The Butterfly effect' was defined at the start of the movie as the theory that something as simple as the flapping of a butterfly's wings in one part of the world can cause a typhoon in another part of the world. I'm not sure about that, but the point of the theory is that simple things can cause big changes. OK - but it seemed to me that Evan wasn't going back in time to make minor changes. A minor change might be 'before I walked home along Elm Street, now I'll walk along Maple Street.' That's a minor change that could possibly have a big impact. But Evan went back in time to prevent Kayleigh from being molested, or to prevent a mother and baby from being killed. Surely these are not minor changes; they're substantive. The movie's end - the chance encounter between Evan and Kayleigh (who now doesn't know him) on the street - also was too cliché for me. Aside from those points, though, I truly enjoyed this movie. 8/10",8,0,1,10 February 2009
District 9," A Good Idea That Wasn't Well Executed
","Unlike many people, I was disappointed with this movie. The extended documentary-like opening (which, in many ways, ran through the whole movie) was too much. It might have served a purpose if it had been a brief way of introducing the basic story, but to film a movie largely in this fashion certainly detracted from the development of the main characters. You certainly feel sympathy for the aliens in general, and even for Wikus eventually, but it takes a while to develop that, which made this seem like little more than watching CNN coverage of a major news event. You watch to see what's happening, but you're not really drawn into the story. By the time the end came, although sympathy was developing for both Wikus and his new alien friend Christoper, the movie took on a certain comic-book feel as Wikus dons the alien suit and takes on the appearance of a sort of alien super-hero. It didn't work that well, and actually felt a bit silly.There were aspects of the story, mind you, that would have been interesting had they been better developed. It was very interesting to see a movie depicting aliens arriving on earth not as evil conquerors but as pathetic refugees - and everything about them seemed pathetic, as they were forced to live in slum-like conditions in what was essentially an internment camp, denied any basic right, and having their needs exploited by the less savoury elements of South African society (where the movie was set) - although I found myself wondering why there was such a focus on 'Nigerian' gangs? Why Nigeria? The movie effectively puts a new spin on the desperate plight of all refugees by making these refugees aliens. Still, the movie didn't really capture me. It was an interesting idea, but I didn't find it particularly well executed.",4,10,19,10 June 2010
Mamma Mia!," Fun And Full Of Energy With Great ABBA Songs
","I've never seen the original stageplay on which this movie is based and so I can't compare the two, but I can't imagine that the movie is any less entertaining than the play. It's fun, full of energy and fast-paced and features some excellent performances. Tops among those must be the performance of Meryl Streep as Donna, a single mom whose wild summer 20 years ago produced a daughter (Sophie, played by Amanda Seyfried) without any knowledge of which one of three possible men is the father. Sophie, about to be married, invites all three to the wedding, assuming she'll know right off who her dad is, but the result is chaos. Streep is a great actress, but in this movie she combined acting with both singing and dancing , and did so brilliantly. Also offering strong performances were Julie Walters and Christine Baranski as the other members of the fictional group the three belonged to. Streep, Baranski and Walters (I would say in that order of descending importance to the movie) overshadowed the three possible dads, played by Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard.) Their performances were fine, but they couldn't match the women in singing and dancing. Brosnan had most of the singing parts among the men and I just didn't think he captured the essence of the music. This, of course, is not unlike ABBA - whose music is the hub around which the story revolves. The songs featuring Anni-Frid and Agnetha as the lead singers were always better, in my opinion, than those which had Benny and Bjorn as the leads.If there's a weakness to the story in this movie, it's the very fact that the story is constructed around a series of ABBA songs that were not written to be used as the basis for a script. The result, I thought, was that the story was a bit rough and awkward in places, but the fun and energy of the movie - and the collection of great ABBA songs (of course, that's a selling point only if you're a fan of ABBA) more than make up for the minor weaknesses that pop up. Also worth watching are some hilarious performances by the cast (not part of the story, but apparently just the cast having some fun) as the closing credits are about to begin, complete with the over the top ABBA wardrobe from the '70's. A very enjoyable movie all the way through. 9/10",9,1,3,4 August 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Little Action And Limited Dialogue In A Movie Almost Totally Devoid Of Passion
","As I sat for almost three hours struggling to make it through this snooze fest I struggled to figure out how so many people can have so many good things to say about this movie. For some inexplicable reason, the longest and most boring movies often seem to be the most highly regarded (almost as if people think that there's some sort of artistic value in being able to put together a movie so long and yet so dull) but come on. For a movie with such a dramatic sounding title, this one is a major disappointment. There's very little action in it, the dialogue is extremely limited and delivered in a passionless monotone most of the way through, the sombre and slow musical score adds to the drudgery and even the narration is offered in a voice reminiscent of an elderly college professor who's gone over the same material year after year for decades and can't wait to retire and finally be rid of it. I thought Brad Pitt would put more energy into the role of the famous outlaw Jesse James, but he comes across as dry as the rest of the movie. Ben Affleck was maybe slightly more intriguing as Robert Ford but not much.The movie begins with the James gang's last major job and documents the beginning of the relationship between Ford and James. From the little I know about Jesse James the movie seems to be fairly accurate, but the focus of the movie is more on Ford and his gradual turning against James, leading up - as the title states - to James' killing. The look at Ford's life after James' killing was a bit interesting, although a lot was left out between the end of the stage show Ford and his brother put together that portrayed the killing and Ford's own demise (mercifully so, given the already excessive length of this production.) Needless to say, I didn't care too much for this movie. 2/10",2,6,13,17 January 2009
Remember the Titans," Truly Inspiring. A Must-See
","'Remember The Titans' is another brilliant piece of acting from Denzel Washington, who must surely rank as one of the finest actors today.Washington plays Herman Boone, in this true story of a black man who takes over as coach of a formerly all white high school football team during the era of desegregation. Having to deal with the former white coach of the football team (Bill Yoast, played by Will Patton), who is kept on as an assistant and who the Board of Education intends to reinstate as soon as the team loses a game under the new coach, Boone struggles to bring the team together and create a team out of a group of high school athletes who don't trust each other, and whose families really don't want them on the same team.This story is inspiring and uplifting in so many ways, and I can't think of a single reason not to recommend it highly. I can't think of a single reason, as a matter of fact, not to rate it as a 10/10. It's a must-see.",10,1,2,30 October 2001
Liar Liar," A Pretty Funny Movie
","Not all comedies manage to get a laugh out of me. This one did - several times - so I have to rate it as a success. I'm not a huge fan of Jim Carrey, and what I don't like about him was evident in abundance here. It was actually summed up by castmate Swoosie Kurtz in the last of the closing out-takes when, while filming one of their courtroom scenes, she turns to him (in a scene where she makes an objection) and shouts 'Over-Actor!' Yeah. That sums it up, and Carrey responds with the words 'They're on to me!' Give him credit - at least he can poke fun at himself! Having said that, his over-acting is distracting and detracts from both the movie and the credibility of his character. Questioning the honesty and ethics of lawyers may be everyone's favourite sport, but Carrey's portrayal of lawyer Fletcher Reede was just too over the top to be believable.And yet, this still works - it's a pretty funny movie. Fletcher builds his law career and his life on lying - to everyone (hence, the play on words: liar/lawyer) including his ex wife (which is probably why she's his 'ex' wife) and his young son, whom he regularly hurts by promising to visit and then making excuses to get out of it. His lies make him a success in the courtroom though and he's on the verge of making partner at his firm when his son makes a wish while blowing out his birthday candles - that for one day, dad wouldn't be able to lie. The wish comes true and the result is chaos. I suppose there's three basic points being made: first, if we all told the truth about everything it would cause a lot of trouble (think of Fletcher speaking to the woman he's never met on the elevator and telling her how much he likes her rather significant 'endowment') and a lot of hurt even to the people we truly care about; second, if we were to lie about everything it would also cause a lot of trouble ; and, finally, don't ignore your kids - they're precious and they need our attention.It's a funny movie with a message. If you can deal with Carrey's over- acting, it's worth watching. 7/10",7,1,1,13 December 2009
Meet the Fockers," Good Performances In A Weak Sequel
","'Meet The Parents' was a good movie - funny and interesting. Essentially what made it funny and interesting was the relationship between Jack (Robert de Niro) and Greg (Ben Stiller.) Jack was enough of a unique character that he was quite funny. The problem with this movie was that there was nothing unique in it.The premise seemed good enough. In the first movie we're introduced to Pam's parents; now we're going to meet Greg's. Played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand it seemed that they would be perfect complements to De Niro. But they ended up being cast as refugees from the 60's. Yes, they were quite a contrast to CIA agent Jack but the whole 'refugees from the 60's' thing has been overdone in my opinion.I just didn't find this movie especially funny, and what I think was supposed to be the climax of the movie, after Jack injected Greg with sodium pentathol to get 'the truth' out of him seemed to me unpleasant and completely unfunny. De Niro's good; Stiller's good; Streisand's good; Hoffman's good. In fact, of the major stars the only one who I thought didn't quite pull it off was Teri Polo as Pam. But for all the good performances, this movie just didn't catch me. I just didn't care for it, which is why I give it a 3.",3,0,0,31 December 2005
Non-Stop," This Kept Me Interested - For About An Hour
","The most unfortunate thing about 'Non-Stop' is that it's 1:46 long. That last :46 was just too much for me. Seriously - I was enjoying this for the most part for the first hour or so, and then it just lost me. Not that I didn't understand it - it just stopped interesting me. Too much that was happening just wasn't making enough sense. Sure, I get that in an action movie you sometimes have to suspend your disbelief - but I was being asked to suspend too much disbelief.First was the rather - shall we say - convoluted plan that the bad guys had hatched. The story revolves around a plan to extort $150 million from an airline - or someone - and a threat to kill one passenger every twenty minutes unless the money is paid. Or the plane is going to be blown up. Or it's going to be blown up anyway regardless I guess. Whatever. This plot depended on so many little details going absolutely right. It depended on things happening to the split second. Or, if it didn't depend on that, still so many things happened right on the split second that it was bewildering. Like the twenty minute thing. Liam Neeson's Agent Marks could literally set his watch by this timing. The deaths happen literally at the 20 minute mark - not 20 minutes and 30 seconds, or 19 minutes and 45 seconds, but literally at 20 minutes - even though there was no way the plotters could have possibly controlled everything that needed to happen so precisely. And how did these guys plan to escape anyway? Sure they had parachutes. So they were going to jump into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean? (This was a flight from the US to London.) What would they do then? And how did they set up all these bank accounts - hundreds of them apparently - all around the world? What? And how did they know that Agent Marks was going to be on this specific flight? Because a lot of their plan seemed to revolve around their knowledge of some of the troubled personal details of his life. And - if his superiors trusted him so little that they wouldn't believe him when a crisis on a flight came up and would readily accept that he was actually a suspect, why was he still an air marshall in the first place? It was all mind-boggling.And it worked for a while. Convoluted? Unbelievable? To the point of ridiculousness? Sure it was, but I could hang in for about an hour in the hope that some sense would be made of this. But it never was. After about an hour I just started thinking how long it was taking this movie to end. Which is never a good sign.There were things I liked about it. Liam Neeson was pretty good. Generally speaking I like Liam Neeson. He worked in the role of Marks - the air marshall dealing with a lot of personal demons. Julianne Moore was pretty good as Marks' seatmate on the plane - the one passenger he seemed able to trust and so he brings her into the circle and she starts to help him get control of the situation. I appreciated the fact that no one decided to introduce a romance between these two. That would have made me roll my eyes a lot sooner than I did. I appreciated the fact that the only Muslim on board the plane was a good guy. I did wonder about his medical knowledge. He identified himself as a molecular neuroscientist or something. Why? Why not just call him a doctor? There seemed no particular reason to make him a molecular neuroscientist if he was going to be providing medical care. But at least he wasn't one of the bad guys.This worked for a while. There was just too much going on that made the whole story implausible. (5/10)",5,3,4,23 April 2016
Man on the Moon," A Complicated Person And A Complicated Movie
","The truth is that I should not have enjoyed this movie. First, I'm not really that interested in Andy Kaufman. To be honest I don't think I ever watched even a single episode of 'Taxi.' Second, I'm not a big fan of Jim Carrey. He has talent, but he usually overacts and goes way overboard rather than letting his talent shine through. Third, I honestly didn't think this movie was great, although based on the content and what it tells us about Andy Kaufman my reaction to it may have been what he would have wanted - I just found that after the first little while it became too much. My gut was telling me that this movie (and the guy portrayed in it) was plain irritating. So why did I keep watching? Because, for some inexplicable reason and in spite of all that, this movie worked somehow. Maybe it's because of how Andy was described by his girlfriend Lynne Margulies (played by Courtney Love) - he was 'a complicated person.' The complicated nature of Andy Kaufman creates interest, even if the movie itself isn't all that great. His life - portrayed here from his childhood to his death - was a complicated one. You wonder having seen it whether there really was an Andy Kaufman - by which I mean, did he actually have an identity of his own or was his identity completely caught up in and submerged by the characters he created and played? I found myself admiring his take on comedy - not going for the easy laughs but instead going for the gut reaction of the audience, whether that gut reaction was positive or negative; whether it caused laughter or anger. I can imagine that one would not walk away from one of his routines feeling neutral about him.The other redeeming thing about the movie - my opening comments notwithstanding - is Jim Carrey. If ever there was a part that Jim Carrey was born to play I would have to say that it was Andy Kaufman. All of Carrey's excesses that usually bother me so much were on display here in abundance, but they seemed to be a perfect fit with what we were being told about Andy Kaufman. I've seen a fair number of Jim Carrey's movies over the years but now that I've seen this one I'd have to say that this is his signature part - in my mind anyway. It was a stunning piece of casting.It's strange to say this about a movie that I can't say I liked all that much - but in spite of not really 'liking' it I enjoyed it. I think Andy Kaufman might understand that reaction. Both he and the movie were 'complicated.' (7/10)",7,0,0,14 May 2011
Saving Private Ryan," Great Battle Scenes And A Thought Provoking Consideration Of The Value Of A Human Life
","Surely this movie presents some of the most believable, most graphic and most gruesome scenes of war ever shown on film. The opening depiction of the storming of Omaha Beach on D-Day and the closing battle as American soldiers desperately try to hold a strategically key bridge against a German attack are brilliantly and soberingly portrayed, and if there was nothing else in this movie worth watching, those battle scenes in and of themselves are a powerful lesson about the horrors of war.The battle scenes serve as an envelope around the main story - the search for Private James Ryan. As the movie begins we learn that Ryan's three brothers have all been killed in battle, and he's the only one of his mother's sons left. Gen. George Marshall (quoting from an eloquent letter written by Abraham Lincoln to a mother who lost 5 sons in the Civil War) orders Ryan found so that he could be returned home before being killed himself, and a squad under Capt. Mitchell (Tom Hanks) is assigned to the task. Believability is a bit of an issue here. I doubt that in the middle of a great war soldiers would be taken away from battle and assigned to this task. Having said that, the very lack of believability gives the search for Ryan it's meaning, and serves as the movie's moral or philosophical purpose. The constant question before the viewer is: how many lives are we willing to sacrifice to save one? There's no answer to that question, but it remains front and centre as even the soldiers assigned to find Ryan increasingly resent the assignment and question its value. The constant challenge I found myself faced with was how I would have felt if I were assigned to find a soldier in such circumstances so that he could be sent home while I stayed to fight a war - and possibly die? Thought-provoking.Still, I didn't think this reached the heights of greatness that some have given it. Thought-provoking it may have been, but between the great battle scenes there were also long stretches with little happening, and overall the movie was too long at more than an hour and a half. It's a movie that's certainly worth watching - but only once. I wouldn't want to see it again. 7/10",7,1,3,4 December 2009
The Pianist," Sobering Depiction Of Warsaw Under German Occupation
","The first thing that should be said is that this is most definitely more than a Holocaust movie. Although that dreadful event stands firmly in the background, this movie is really about one man's struggle for survival. The one man is Polish Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played that lead role, and he played it well. Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role, because as the movie progresses, there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice, but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man, whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw - not just the Jewish ghetto, but other parts of the city as well. The scenes of rubble, the scenes of innocent people being gunned down in the street by German soldiers - sometimes just for sport, without any other obvious reason, the scenes of burned out buildings. It's all haunting.For all that - and all that was very good - there was something about the story that didn't really click with me. For some strange reason I found it difficult to follow and I did think that at almost two and a half hours it was a little bit too long. As much as was accomplished in that running time could have been accomplished in two hours flat. It's a good movie, but just failed to reach the level of greatness that some have assigned to it. 6/10",6,10,23,4 November 2009
Revolutionary Road," Thoroughly Unpleasant From Start To Finish
","As I suspect many people were, I was drawn to this movie primarily out of curiosity, wanting to see the 'great reunion' - Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet reunited 11 years after their blockbuster starring turns in 'Titanic' - with Kathy Bates thrown into the mix as well. There's no doubt that DiCaprio and Winslet have some powerful scenes together, but this movie is about as far removed from 'Titanic' as any movie could possibly be. In this movie set in the 50's, they play the Wheelers - Frank and April - a young couple trying to make their way in the world, dissatisfied with life, with marriage, with each other and with pretty much everything else. They hatch a scheme for Frank to quit a job he hates to allow the family to move to Paris to let him 'discover' himself while she supports them. Things seem to improve for a while, but the plan falls apart, and eventually so does everything else in their lives. The Wheelers are not a pleasant couple to watch or listen to, and, by the end of the movie, pretty much everybody else is sending the message 'I don't want to talk about the Wheelers any more.' They do have those handful of powerful, raw with (negative) emotion scenes, but in the absence of that anger (which sometimes seemed to border on hatred) Frank and April are actually pretty dry together, which might make a valid point about the state of their marriage, but which isn't very interesting to watch. In the end, I just found them to be unpleasant characters in an unpleasant movie. This certainly isn't a movie I would recommend to anyone. 2/10",2,17,29,12 April 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," Quite A Spectacle
","This is no doubt a magnificently filmed spectacle (that word seems to suit it better than the more mundane 'movie' or 'film') about one of the more enigmatic characters of the 20th century - the British officer T.E. Lawrence - and his involvement in the Arab nationalist movement during World War I (and after - although the post-War material wasn't included.) The desert scenes are stark and beautiful (as you would expect a desert to be) but also portray the dangers of the desert (again as you would expect.) The portrayal of the Arabs is for the most part accurate (a bickering group of loosely allied tribes rather than any sort of unified nation) and the performances were generally very good. Peter O'Toole (in his earliest role of significance) was brilliant in his portrayal of Lawrence (effectively portraying divided loyalties and a sort of messianic - perhaps somewhat mentally unbalanced - sense of his own destiny.) Alec Guinness was surprisingly effective as Prince Feisal - the closest there was to an accepted leader of the Arabs. There are some excellent desert battle scenes (especially where the Arabs under Lawrence take out an Ottoman train and the attack on Damascus.)The biggest problem with the movie is its history. The movie glorifies Lawrence (or at least his role) too much. He wasn't quite as central to the movement for Arab independence (or to the Arab revolt against Ottoman rule) as portrayed, for example. At close to four hours, there's also no doubt that all but the most dedicated will suffer a few yawns here and there (and I confess that I watched this in two parts.) Still, this deserves credit for its very ambition and for its high quality (some suspect history notwithstanding.)",8,0,1,2 August 2010
It Follows," Appropriately Creepy
","On the creepiness factor - which is probably the most important element in a movie like this - 'It Follows' works brilliantly. For me, what has made a lot of teen horror movies major disappointments is that they've settled into little more than blood and gore fests, where you spend most of your time waiting for the next kid to bite the dust. But a lot of those movies lack the proper atmosphere. This one sets that mood of creepiness over gore right from the start; the moment when Jay (Maika Monroe) wakes up bound and confined to a wheelchair in a parking lot, while the guy she had just had sex with and who chloroformed her after (which was a twist in itself) explains that the sex passed on a curse to her that she could only rid herself of by having sex with someone else. And 'it' - the curse - stalks her for the rest of the movie, as her friends try to help her.It's a pretty simple plot, and it worked well. Nothing about the curse (except how to get rid of it) was ever explained. It was just a mystery, and that lack of understanding just heightened everything. For this kind of movie, there was surprisingly little nudity, and almost no blood. Instead - surprise - the movie revolved around an actual story, which was very refreshing. On an entirely different level, you could look at this as a warning about the potential danger of casual sex, I suppose.Monroe's performance as Jay was very convincing, and the musical score quite effective. I did keep scratching my head wondering where all these kids' parents were. Or perhaps that was another subtle warning - this one about the danger of absentee parents. Basically, very well done all round. One of the better horror movies made in recent years. (7/10)",7,1,4,26 November 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," It Fits Well Into The Series But Perhaps Pays Too Much Homage To Its Predecessors
","There have been a number of possible explanations offered by Hollywood over the years to explain exactly how it is that apes took over the earth. It's been a very long time since I read the book, so I don't remember if Pierre Bouille's original novel engaged in the speculation, but in the 1968 original movie it was an evolutionary process after a nuclear war devastated human society; in the 4th instalment ('Conquest ...') it was an ape rebellion against what had become effective slavery; my memory of the 2001 movie (which I enjoyed by the way) is that the explanation was rather convoluted. This is another attempt - whose purpose is clearly identified by the title. This is at times a very exciting movie. The opening scenes, as a group of chimpanzees are chased through their jungle home and captured is both exciting and rather sad, and the ape rebellion at the end of the movie (which takes up most of the last half hour) is quite well portrayed. In between, the movie is almost always interesting and offers some worthwhile explorations of a variety of topics: animal rights, the place of animal research, the dangers of human beings going where perhaps we shouldn't go. All those issues are present and you certainly find yourself thinking about them as the movie progresses. The clearest comparison within the entire 'Apes' franchise would probably be to the movie 'Conquest ...' What I appreciated about this was that the ultimate success of the rebellion was not as clear. It seemed too easy in 'Conquest;' here, the apes manage to escape from the facility they were being held in, they wreak havoc throughout San Francisco, and they escape to the redwood forest. It's left as an open question (for a sequel?) as to how this particular revolution is going to spread, although one possible explanation is a virus that kills humans but makes apes more intelligent. That virus was the engine that moved most of the story forward. It was a drug invented as a possible cure for Alzheimer's Disease, with apes being used as subjects for experiments.I had a mixed reaction to the cast. James Franco was all right as Will, the scientist chiefly responsible for the Alzheimer's drug, but who also has something of a soft spot for the apes. This certainly, however, didn't match his performance in '127 Hours.' John Lithgow was solid in a somewhat limited role as his father, who's suffering from Alzheimer's Disease, which explains Will's motivation. Somewhat mystifying to me was Freida Pinto's turn as Caroline Aranha, a veterinarian who develops a romantic relationship with Will. That relationship wasn't (thankfully) front and centre, but without the relationship being front and centre (which would have taken the movie in a direction it didn't need to go) Pinto's role seemed totally unnecessary.Unlike other instalments in the 'Apes' series of movies, the apes themselves are CGI-created. Perhaps in some ways they look more ape-like than humans in ape costumes, but to be honest at times (particularly as they swing through trees, etc.) they really didn't look real. I wasn't especially taken with the decision to go CGI on the apes. Although the use of actors might have been superfluous since the apes don't really speak, it might have made the viewer even more sympathetic to the apes than I was by giving me a real personality to connect with. While I recognize that this is part of a huge franchise dating back over 40 years, at times it seemed to be trying too hard to establish its place in the 'canon,' so to speak, by making totally unnecessary references to earlier movies. The chase of the chimps through the jungle and their capture was somewhat reminiscent of the capture of Taylor and the other humans in the '68 movie, the original chimp taken from the wild is given the name 'Bright Eyes' (like the human Taylor in '68), her son gets named Caesar (from 'Conquest.') Also in clear references to '68 we have water hoses being used against the intelligent caged ape, and, of course, the famous line gets spoken again: 'get your stinking paws off me, you damn, dirty ape!' Even the font used for the title was identical to the font used in the original series of movies! Maybe that was all too much. Were all those connections really necessary? I don't think so.I wouldn't deny, though, that it's a pretty exciting movie and it's not a bad fit into the overall series. (7/10)",7,1,2,12 November 2011
Cars," Typically Good Disney/Pixar Material
","Everything that you expect Disney/Pixar to do well, they managed to do well in 'Cars.' The animation is absolutely superb and there's a valuable message included about learning to take life slowly, enjoy the scenery and those around you and not being fixated about winning everything and every time. All of that I can buy into without any trouble, and the movie even nods respectfully at the racing scene that inspired it by including the voices of drivers like Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Mario Andretti and Michael Schumacher.The story revolves around Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) - a rookie car in the championship circuit whose on track to win the 'Piston Cup.' When the season ends in a 3 way tie, a final race between the 3 is scheduled in California, but on the way west, McQueen end sup trapped in Radiator Springs, once booming and now almost a ghost town because it was bypassed by the interstate. In Radiator Springs, McQueen (highly frustrated at first that he can't get to California as fast as he wants to) discovers a different and slowed down lifestyle and he starts to discover and understand virtues like friendship and loyalty.All that worked very well. Surprising, then, that I have to admit that the movie never really struck home with me. Maybe it's just the difficult in figuring out how to rate an animated movie whose appeal is mostly to the younger set. It has a lot going for it. I can't argue with that. I just didn't find that it held my attention all that well. But if you like Disney/Pixar stuff, you'll certainly find that there's nothing wrong with this. It just didn't really make much of a connection with me for some reason. (5/10)",5,0,1,5 October 2012
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Somewhat Over-Hyped
","Over 41% of reviewers here at IMDb have rated this movie as a perfect 10. Either they're all wrong, or I am.It was OK, but I didn't think it was anything to write home about. Some intertwined love stories, a lot of martial arts type fight scenes and alliances that were difficult to keep track of. That's what I found, in this movie about the theft of a legendary prized sword. The story wasn't uninteresting, but I just found too many flights into fantasy as we watched people soar through the air and walk on water or treetops. This even detracted from the martial arts scenes, as too much of it just seemed unbelievable. There were good special affects, and some of the photography was brilliant, but the movie itself just didn't capture me the way I thought it would from everything I had seen and heard about it.Too each his own, I guess. I can only muster a 5/10 for this.",5,0,1,24 March 2002
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Quentin Tarantino Managed To Pull This Together
","I have to be honest and say that at about the halfway point of this movie I was truly wondering what all the hype was about. It was mildly to moderately interesting to watch the story of 'Rick Dalton' play out. Played by Leonardo DiCaprio, Dalton was a fading star in late 1960's Hollywood. He'd been a mega-TV star of one of television's ubiquitous western series of the time, but then made the mistake of trying to venture into movies, resulting in the cancellation of his series and him being reduced to guest appearances on various TV shows and, ultimately, to spaghetti westerns. His story - along with that of his stuntman Cliff (Brad Pitt) - was interesting (and even somewhat sad) but wasn't really that enthralling. DiCaprio and Pitt both did good jobs in their respective roles, but I wasn't understanding the hype. Although, right from the start there was an angle; a hook. It turned out that Dalton's next door neighbours were Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate - and this movie was set in 1969. So you knew there had to be some connection coming to the Manson family murders. That angle really was what held my attention. I wanted to see how the stories were going to intertwine - and the movie starts to take a more ominous turn when Cliff finally encounters the Manson family after picking up a hitch-hiker who was a member.It's really at that point that Tarantino's unique touch takes over the movie, and what had been a relatively sedate and somewhat sad reflection on what appeared to be the closing chapter's of Dalton's acting career became a wild ride to the finish. The connection to the Manson family murders comes in the last 20-25 minutes of the movie - but not in the way you expect. This movie constructs an alternate history. The Manson family invades not the Polanski-Tate house, but Dalton's house - and Cliff, Rick and Cliff's faithful dog take them on and do away with them in a violent and bloody fashion that - for all its violence and bloodiness - actually had me laughing out loud at those last few scenes, especially when Rick torches one of them with the flame thrower he had kept as a souvenir from one of his movies. It was indeed a wild ride, closing with Rick being invited to hang out with Sharon tate and her friends after they found out what had happened. It was really a fascinating piece of alternative history, well crafted by Tarantino and there's no possible way that you as a viewer can take your eyes off the screen for those last 20 minutes as the confrontation between the Manson family and Dalton's group escalates in a weirdly hilarious fashion.But perhaps the greatest tribute I can pay to this movie is that while the first half or so wasn't particularly exciting, there was always enough going on to hold my attention. Whle there were times that I found myself wondering where this was going, it never got boring to me, and I was actually shocked to discover - when I checked the time after it ended - that this movie was close to three hours long. It didn't feel it. So it was extremely well paced and it built very deliberately to that unforgettable conclusion. It's very well done. I've had mixed responses to tarantino's films. Some I've liked very much, others have left me cold. But I'd say that 'Once Upon A Time ... In Hollywood' is the best Tarantino film I've seen. (8/10)",8,11,18,9 August 2019
Behind The Candelabra," Michael Douglas And Matt Damon As You Never Thought You'd See Them
","I can't honestly say that I know very much about Liberace. I was a teenager in the 70's - Liberace really wasn't my cup of tea. Still, I know about him. His flashiness, his sexuality, his ability with the piano - and I'm familiar with the 'palimony' suit launched against him by his much younger lover, Scott Thorson. 'Behind the Candelabra' is the movie adaptation of Thorson's book about the relationship, so it needs to be viewed with a grain of salt; it's hardly unbiased. But unbiased or not, it is a fascinating look into the glitzy, showy, and sometimes degenerate world inhabited by Liberace and Thorson, who was almost 50 years younger than Liberace when the relationship began.The 'world' is fabulously portrayed. The costumes and sets seem very authentic, and - with the above note about bias being kept in mind - the basic story of the relationship is believable enough. Liberace and Thorson were together for four years, and in those four years, things got weird. Liberace supposedly promised to adopt Thorson; and Thorson was given a part in Liberace's show. The movie portrays the relationship's breakup (due to Liberace's infidelities) and the final reunion between the two, as Thorson visits Liberace on his deathbed. It all seems very realistic, and provides an almost voyeuristic experience into the relationship between the two.The highlight of the movie, though, has to be the performances offered by Matt Damon (as Thorson) and - especially - Michael Douglas as Liberace. Both were brilliant and totally believable in the parts. These must have been difficult roles. Two guys - both obviously straight - playing these parts in a movie which includes a lot of very passionate scenes between them could have come across as awkward, but credit goes to both of them for the fact that it never seemed awkward. They came across as natural together in what must (at times) have been very uncomfortable roles for them. I gained a new appreciation of the talents of both from this movie.It's very enjoyable and it certainly offers a glimpse into a world that the vast majority of us will never see - and that the vast majority of us probably wouldn't want to see.

Gone Girl," A Half Decent Cast Offer Bad Performances In An Awful Movie
","The cast of 'Gone Girl' is half decent. The leads are relatively big names - Ben Affleck as Nick and Rosamund Pike as Amy (not the biggest, but certainly known.) The supporting cast wouldn't cause me to swoon, but they're decent enough (people like Tyler Perry, Kim Dickens and Neil Patrick Harris are in this.) But regardless of the so-called 'critical consensus' (which seems to be very positive) you don't have to get very far into this to discover that you have a half decent cast in what's at best a third-rate movie.I thought the performances by and large (from everyone) were awful. It's as if this half decent cast realized from the start that they were starring in one dog of a movie. The story had some potential. As it starts Amy and Nick are a seemingly happy young couple on top of the world, with money and in love. But things don't work out well for them, they lose their jobs and they have to move from New York City to Missouri to care for Nick's elderly parents and everything about their life unravels. Ultimately - and here's where the whole thing (which wasn't that good to start) falls apart - Amy fakes her own death, and manages to frame Nick for her murder. Nick isn't a good guy - in fact there's not a single character in this movie who's really likeable or sympathetic, except possibly Det. Boney (Dickens) - and once his wife is 'killed' he becomes the immediate prime suspect (more by the tabloid media than by Boney, who's never entirely convinced about what's happening.) He gets portrayed as a sociopath, but it's really Amy who's the crazy sociopath. The first hour or so of the movie deals with Nick being hounded by the police and media. Then comes the twist - Amy is alive and hiding out, and we get flashbacks now to see how she set the whole thing up. Then another plot twist as Amy's hiding out crashes and burns; then another plot twist with the ex-boyfriend she seeks refuge from; then another plot twist as she returns home. It's not interesting - it's more mind-numbing. It goes on way, way, way too long. Once you get to the third or fourth plot twist you're wondering 'good God - how long can this go on?' And it goes on far too long. Actually once we're into the story that follows the last plot twist I actually found myself chuckling at times (especially at discovering that the police and hospital have sent Amy back home after she resurfaces, still covered in blood - they could't clean her up?) I wasn't chuckling because it was funny - but because it was just so bad. To me, it seems as if to really like this movie you have to be one of those pathetic 'professional victim' men, who think women and the world are all out to get them. This will certainly feed their paranoia. (2/10)",2,3,6,20 August 2018
Drive," The Very Definition Of 'Dreadful'
","Seriously - there are times when I just don't get this site. I get that people have different tastes in movies - but this movie has a ridiculously high rating. To be perfectly blunt about it - it's dreadful. If you look up the word 'dreadful' in the dictionary, I'm sure that there will be some reference to 'Drive' in the definition. It takes almost half the movie before we really get a sense of where this is going - and even then it doesn't become very interesting. It's ridiculously and often graphically bloody and makes terrible use of bad music to try to build suspense.Ryan Gosling is the star of this. He plays a Hollywood stunt driver who also moonlights as a driver for more than a few shady characters. But that really doesn't matter, because ultimately his 'undercover work' isn't what gets him in trouble. He gets in trouble because he falls for his neighbour - who happens to be married to a guy who gets out of prison owing a lot of money, and he decides to help him out, gets entangled in - something. I tried - hard - to follow along but I spent a lot more of my time just trying to stay awake.One thing I have discovered over the years is that people get caught up in the hype about a movie, and when it turns out to be dreadful, they can't admit that they got caught up in the hype, so rather than calling it a good movie, it becomes an 'artistic masterpiece' or some such thing. But seriously - let's cut to the chase. This was dreadful. Just dreadful. (1/10)",1,7,12,21 March 2017
The Theory of Everything," A Brief History Of Stephen & Jane Hawking
","There's an image that we have of Stephen Hawking: basically, a brilliant man trapped in a useless body. To know all that he's accomplished given the obvious challenges and limitations that he faces is in itself inspiring. And, clearly, in spite of it all, he has a sense of humour. This may seem silly, but one thing that I truly admire about him is that he sometimes appears on 'The Big Bang Theory' - surely one of the silliest (and, yes, best) shows on television. But there's a lot about Stephen Hawking that I didn't know. I, like many I've talked to, thought his disability had been from birth. I honestly never realized that he had married and had children. I found that 'The Theory Of Everything' put a very human face to this man who seems, somehow, different than the rest of us - more limited in some ways, far superior in other ways. As a brief history of the life of the author of 'A Brief History Of Time,' this movie worked very well.Not just brilliant, Hawking is a very complex man, with a very complicated personal history. The movie begins with him falling in love, and more or less ends with the end of his (first) marriage. The relationship between Stephen and Jane starts as a truly simple romance of two people who just find each other. It becomes a true love story as Stephen begins to decline physically and is diagnosed with ALS and given two years to live. It then becomes a story of devotion as Jane cares for him and encourages him in his work. There's then the sad and tragic end as the love Stephen and Jane have for each other isn't enough to keep them together. It is, in fact, a brief but well done account of Hawking's life and of Jane and Stephen's relationship.The lead performances from Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones as Stephen and Jane are superb. Redmayne especially seemed to capture Stephen Hawking, which must have been a difficult acting job, trying to capture the reality of Hawkings' physical decline.The only real weakness I saw in this was that it jumped into the love story too quickly. I thought we could have been offered a bit more of a glimpse of Hawking's early life, which might have made for a fuller character study. But what we do see here is fascinating. The movie is both sad and inspiring, and sometimes both at the same time - which is a rather difficult balance to achieve. 'The Theory Of Everything' pulls that off well.

2012," A Fun Special Effects Action/Adventure
","Sure the plot is ridiculous. And,to be honest, the performances in this aren't that great, either. Still, when it's over, this movie leaves you feeling as if you've been on quite a ride. It's a special effects extravaganza - and the special effects are done very well; certainly some of the best FX work I've come across in a very long time. And that's what the whole thing revolves around: one special effects behemoth scene after another, with virtually everything (after a rather slow opening 10 minutes or so) being action/adventure and very little attention being paid to plot. Yeah, we get the basics. Some massive solar flare activity has affected the earth and is basically causing our world to turn itself inside out for lack of a better way to put it. The story (such as it is) is about the attempts of the international community to find a way to save our species (at least a few hundred thousand of us.) Considering all the publicity this movie received (or, perhaps it's better to say all the attention the ancient Mayan calendar received because of the movie) I was surprised by how little attention was actually paid to the ancient Mayan calendar in this. I believe it was mentioned a couple of times, but it certainly wasn't front and centre.It's strange to say that this was enjoyable - strange because of the poor story, the sub-par acting and the very weak attempts at humour that are scattered throughout, which seemed out of place and in some cases just too cute (think of the scene in which Gordon and Kate are in a supermarket and Gordon suggests that it feels as if they're splitting apart - at which point the supermarket indeed splits apart with them on either side of the divide.) Right. Too cute. And yet, this is well worth watching. It's fun, action-packed, energetic and it leaves your head spinning at times. I thought it was thoroughly enjoyable.",8,1,2,27 March 2010
P.S. I Love You," A Combination Of Dreadfully Boring And Sugary Sweet
","The opening scenes of this movie portray a passionate and obviously comic argument between Holly and Gerry (Hilary Swank and Gerald Butler.) For a couple of minutes, the argument was humorous. It quickly grew old, but unfortunately it went on and on for about ten minutes. By that time I already had a bad taste in my mouth from this movie that never really went away. Yes - it's the proverbial 'chick flick,' so perhaps I shouldn't have expected to really like it, but romantic comedies can still be fun - chick flick or not. In this case, however, the humour seemed to be forced and artificial - everyone seemed to be trying to hard to be funny; it wasn't coming across as natural. Combined with a rather lifeless performance from Swank as well as the ridiculous character of Denise (Lisa Kudrow) - surely one of the dumbest 'serious' characters ever to appear in a movie - the whole thing fell apart rather quickly. It was at best a weak romantic comedy, with actors who didn't really seem to click and characters who didn't appeal to me particularly. The one exception might have been Daniel. I felt sorry for him when he ended up stuck in the middle of Holly's problem of not being able to let go of Gerry. Gerry (her husband) had died of a brain tumour, but before he died he had put together a plan to help her move on and begin to enjoy her life again: a series of letters and gifts being delivered to her from him, each of which pushed her a little farther along the path to healing. This just struck me as a generally lifeless movie that accomplished very little in the end, although I did appreciate one bit of philosophy found within: 'life is a great and short and terrible thing and none of us are going to get out of it alive.' I'm a minister. I think I might be able to make use of that someday. Aside from that, though, there was precious little here that interested me. 3/10",3,3,5,11 February 2009
Good Will Hunting," Great Performance By Damon, But The Movie As A Whole Was A Bit Of A Drag
","Matt Damon was great. There's no doubt about that. His performance as Will Hunting - a genius who just doesn't fit into society and ends up as a janitor at MIT instead of a student - was fabulous, and made the movie worth watching. Unfortunately I personally didn't think there was much else fabulous about this. The story was modestly interesting, and the viewer certainly does want to know what eventually happens to Will. The ending was, strangely, both appropriately and unfortunately ambiguous, as Will leaves behind an opportunity to 'make it' in order to pursue love. I say 'appropriately' because the lack of resolution seemed to fit with the rest of his life, and 'unfortunately' because it left me with no clear knowledge of what happened to him. The movie also raises valid questions about what it means to 'fit in.' Will didn't, because he wasn't doing what everyone thought he should do with his life, but - on the other hand - maybe that was just Will. Do we have to fit into a preconceived notion of what we should be doing? Fair question.So, there was a lot of good stuff in the actual story. Now, I know this is a minority opinion, but I wasn't take with the rest of the cast: Steven Skarsgard as the professor who discovers Will and tries to mold him, Ben Affleck as Will's best friend from South Boston (who co-wrote the movie with Damon), Minnie Driver as Skylar - Will's burgeoning love interest, and Robin Wiliams as the counsellor who helps Will confront some of his past demons. None of them were bad, but they also didn't really grab hold of me. Frankly, I also found the movie dragged dreadfully at times and at a little over two hours was a bit too long as a result. Damon's standout performance helps this get a 4/10.",4,2,5,29 May 2009
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," It Was OK
","Ben Stiller was very good in the title role. That's the first thing I'd say. From my perspective, it was one of his better performances. As Walter, he plays the head of the negative assets department for LIFE Magazine, which is about to publish its last print edition before becoming an online only magazine. In that position, Walter is responsible for a series of negatives from a hotshot photographer (who would ultimately be played by Sean Penn in little more than a cameo), one of which is to be the final cover photo. But one of the negatives (#25) is missing, and the movie revolves around Walter's wide-ranging search for it.Walter is a likable character. He's a guy who's largely bored and unsatisfied with life, who spends a lot of time daydreaming about what could be - some of his daydreams are realistic, others not so much. That sometimes gets a bit confusing, since it isn't always clear whether what we're watching is real or whether it's only happening in Walter's head. And as likable as Walter may be, I just didn't find myself caught up in the search for negative #25. It did give the movie the opportunity to go to some interesting places. You really don't see many movies that are set for significant periods of time in places like Iceland and Greenland - although whether those places were portrayed at all realistically is doubtful. Still ... Iceland and Greenland. But aside from the curiosity of the setting, the search for negative #25 rather bored me.There was also the problem of Ted Hendricks. Played by Adam Scott, Ted was the mean and nasty boss in charge of the transition from print to online, apparently delighting in telling people they would lose their job - heartless, callous and unfeeling. Yes, it happens, and the powers that be aren't always kind and compassionate, but Ted was too much of a caricature for my liking.This is certainly worth watching for Ben Stiller's performance, but for me at least the story left a lot to be desired.

Schindler's List," Horrific And Yet So Inspiring At The Same Time
","This movie must be the best piece of work dealing with the Holocaust that I have ever seen. The only criticism I can find myself making of it is that it was a little bit confusing in the first hour or so, but even that was probably appropriate as the movie portrays a time of chaos anyway. The first thing that one notices is the decision to film the movie in black and white. That was a brilliant decision. Somehow, it gives the story greater power. The brutality of the Holocaust is obvious, the sadistic nature of the SS is portrayed brilliantly, both in depictions of actual events and by Ralph Fiennes in his portrayal of SS officer Amon Goeth, the confusion and uncertainty and desperation of the Jews is palpable. Everything is raw with power. I would have liked some greater explanation of the impact of the little girl who provides the only splashes of colour in the movie (she's dressed in red) on Schindler. She's hardly the only child he sees suffer. Why her in particular?Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Itzhak Stern, the Jewish accountant recruited by Schindler to run his business is appropriately low-key. Here was a man who saw an opportunity to help his fellow Jews through Schindler's company and who quietly took advantage of it. Which brings me to Liam Neeson's portrayal of Schindler. He did a great job - completely believable as he portrays Schindler's evolution from a businessman who just wanted to make money and who brought Jews into his factory for no reason except that they were the cheapest labour available to a man determined to protect his Jewish workers from the insanity and horror of Auschwitz. The closing scene, as he breaks down crying out that he feels he should have saved more people, is one of the most powerful and moving scenes I have ever seen in a movie, especially as Stern quietly comforts him and says 'no - you did so much' and the other Jews he saved rush up to embrace and comfort him. It was also moving to see the Schindler Jews honouring his grave at the end of the movie. Schindler provides the inspiration here. Yes, it's inspiring that he saved 1200 Jews, but the inspiration goes beyond that. As the story makes clear, Schindler was largely a failure at everything he did in life, both before and after the war. And yet, this man - who was (I hate to use the word, but it's pretty much true) a loser - managed to rise to what must have seemed an insurmountable challenge and accomplished something great of historic proportions. If a man like Schindler could do this, surely others can do it too - not with respect to the Holocaust anymore (thank God!) but with some of the other issues in the world today. This is truly a brilliant piece of work. 9/10",9,9,13,3 August 2009
The Mist," Taut With Suspense And Very Frightening At Times
","From the opening scenes, 'The Mist' grabs you and pulls you into a mystery, and the pacing of the story is brilliant, as the mystery is gradually, bit by bit, revealed and explained in a way that ensures that the viewer never loses interest. Throughout, this movie is taut with suspense, and unlike many so-called 'horror' movies, this one is even pretty frightening at times and it all leads up to a conclusion that is both absolutely shocking and horribly sad, because in the end you know that David (Thomas Jane) did the only thing that he possibly could have done in the circumstances (and it was actually an incredibly noble and heroic act) only to find out that it was absolutely unnecessary, leaving you to wonder how in the world this guy is ever going to be able to survive what has happened.It isn't necessary to speak at length about the plot here, except to say that this is a pretty fascinating study of how a relatively small group of people react to being forced to confront a horrific situation from which there seems to be no escape. What lengths will they go to? What depths will they fall to? All the characters are interesting to watch. My only real criticism of this movie might be the character of Mrs. Carmody. The performance from Marcia Gay Harden was very good, but it seemed to me to be something characteristic of a handful of Stephen King stories - the addition of unnecessary content that sometimes distracts a bit from the horror of what's happening. I could see value in adding a character who would rally an increasingly uncontrollable mob around them. Why the character had to be a fundamentalist religious nut was beyond me, and she did start to grate on me after a while. Aside from that one point, though, I thought this was an excellent movie, the best horror movie I've seen in a very long time. 9/10",9,2,5,8 January 2009
The Elephant Man," This Is Perhaps The Most Emotionally Moving Movie Ever Made
","Watching this movie is a powerful emotional experience. In an era in which movies are increasingly appreciated more for their action and special effects than anything else, here we have a simple human drama drawn from real life - the story of John Merrick (whose real name was Joseph), known to late 19th century England as 'The Elephant Man.' As is perfectly normal with this type of movie, the story uses dramatic license in some things. In particular, there's apparently no evidence that Merrick ever met 'Mrs. Kendal' (played by Ann Bancroft) although she did take quite an interest in his case. Basically, though, this is a reasonably accurate portrayal of Merrick's early life as an attraction in a freak show, and his later life in the London Hospital, his friendship with Dr. Frederick Treves (played by Anthony Hopkins) and his growing acceptance by London's high society, including the Princess of Wales (played by Helen Ryan.)The movie is moving. One can't help but be saddened by the conditions Merrick (who was played brilliantly and sensitively by John Hurt) had to live in and by the way he was treated by many of those around him. The movie also raises a lot of thought-provoking questions. The nature and role of freak shows is front and centre in the first half or so of this movie. We in the modern world think of such exhibitions as repulsive, and yet in the context of the times they did provide a way for those who were 'different' and likely to be rejected by society to survive and earn some sort of living. And while the movie depicts Bytes (Freddie Jones) - the operator of the freak show - as an entirely unpleasant character, Tom Norman (the real name of the freak show operator) denied this, and there's some question about how Merrick was treated in the show. There's also the question of his acceptance by high society. Was this acceptance sincere, or was Merrick simply transformed into a somewhat higher class freak show for the satisfaction of the rich and powerful? Probably the answer was a bit of both.The most unsettling scene in the movie is probably that in which the Night Porter at the hospital brings a bunch of his pub friends to get a look at Merrick (after charging them a significant fee to do so) and the hideous way in which he's treated during that encounter. That may have been more dramatic licence (and therefore, because of the response it brings forth, a bit manipulative.) Merrick's ultimate death (he either asphyxiated himself or died of a broken neck while trying to sleep lying down like 'other people - he had to sleep sitting up because of the weight of his head) is extremely sad.This is a first-rate movie. The performances from everyone were superb and the decision by director David Lynch to film this in black and white reminds us that these events were from a different time and seem to re- enforce somehow the emotional power of the movie. Excellent work - a must see movie!",10,0,0,28 December 2010
I Am Legend," Good Version Of A Familiar Story
","I've seen Vincent Price in 1964's 'The Last Man On Earth' but not Charlton Heston's 'The Omega Man.' Along with 'I Am Legend' all three are versions of the same sci-fi story. I liked the Price movie, although I thought there were a number of holes in the story which made it difficult to accept. For the most part, 'I Am Legend' avoids those holes (although it does leave some unanswered questions - probably deliberately, since the disease and its effects are supposed to be mysteries.) Will Smith was excellent as Robert Neville, a military scientist who is one of the last survivors of a deadly disease that spread rapidly around the world. The disease started as a miracle cure for cancer until the side effects - described in the movie as being like the beginning of rabies - started to develop. Eventually, the disease causes mutations and even physical changes which leave the afflicted living a sort of wild-animal like existence, hunting after dark for victims to kill and devour. Neville for some reason is immune to the disease and fights both to find a cure for it and to survive.Compared to the '64 version, I thought this was by far the superior movie. Neville's psychological deterioration struck me as more realistic than anything portrayed by Price, the afflicted humans are more believable than the zombie-like vampires come back from the dead in the '64 movie, and overall this movie is far more frightening (and yet not particularly bloody). Smith was often putting on a virtual one man show, and he did so quite successfully. One could say that Neville's ultimate fate was a bit too cliché for a Hollywood action movie, and while I appreciated the extremely hopeful end of the movie, things at that 'survivors colony' in Vermont did seem far too 'normal.' (And, if that colony could survive because the virus couldn't survive the cold, then one assumes that we in Canada must have been quite fine, so I'll stop dreaming about the South Pacific and rejoice in the cold and snowy winters!) Overall, though, this was a pretty enjoyable ride. 8/10",8,0,0,2 December 2008
Dog Day Afternoon," An Inside Look At A Botched Bank Robbery
","Al Pacino puts on a brilliant performance here as Sonny Wortzik, a desperate man who tries to rob a bank - an attempt that just keeps going more and more wrong as each minute goes by. Apparently based on true events (with the real names having been changed) the movie provides a fascinating look at both the bungled bank job and Sonny's extremely complicated personal life. Divorced from his wife (with whom he had two children) Sonny had begun a relationship with a pre-operative transsexual (played by Chris Sarandon) who was becoming suicidal over not being able to afford a sex change operation. In partnership with Sal (John Cazale) Sonny robs the bank, but the police respond very quickly and Sonny ends up with a bank full of hostages. An interesting aside in the movie is watching how the various hostages handled the situation. The only real weakness I can see in this movie is that there's no explanation of who Sal was, or of how he was connected with Sonny. Sal provides a bit of humour to the movie. He comes across as completely lost, and begins to worry when he finds out that the media are reporting that the robbers are 'two homosexuals.' He wasn't a homosexual, and he wanted the world to know that! Charles Durning also put on a good performance as NYPD Detective Moretti, who's handling the robbery, and who comes across as a pretty decent guy who really wants to find a way out of this for everyone.Essentially what we have here is a fascinating story complemented by excellent performances all around. It's a 9/10.",9,1,2,9 June 2008
The Game," It's Completely Lacking In Credibility
","I like psychological suspense-thrillers. What makes them work really well is believability. No matter how outlandish the story may seem, there has to be at least a bit of your brain that's saying as you watch 'I could see that happening.' That's when you get drawn into the story. That's when suspense takes hold. That's when you begin to be able to feel the fear of the main characters. That's when a psychological suspense-thriller works really well. Unfortunately, 'The Game' doesn't work really well. It doesn't do any of the above. It's simply not believable. Never once in the movie (or at least once we were introduced to the game that Nicholas Van Orten was playing) did I have the thought that 'I could see this happening.' Never. It was too outlandish. Think about it. In order for this game to work, pretty much the entire City of San Francisco would have had to have been onside. Van Orten could have done any number of things or (and here's the real problem) encountered any number of people who - not being in on the game - could have changed things completely. The game (to me at least) is unworkable; unplayable. Since that was my feeling right from the start, I didn't get pulled in by the story. I found it long and drawn out. The writers tried valiantly to keep me on my toes by throwing twists and turns and surprises - but I really didn't care, because I just didn't believe any of it. Too bad.Too bad, because the cast was good and solid. Michael Douglas was in character, playing a fairly stereotypical character for him, as Nicholas Van Orten, and Sean Penn did well as his little brother Conrad, who presented Nicholas with the game as a birthday gift. I liked Deborah Unger as the 'waitress' Christine. Honestly? She's attractive, but not the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, but she had a chemistry with Douglas, and she did present a real aura of sexiness, even though that wasn't particularly what the character was about (the 'I'm not wearing any underwear' comment notwithstanding!) The basic idea of a movie about a 'reality game' (made in the era before 'reality TV' became a staple) was interesting. If this had just been toned down a bit, and the scale of the game not been quite so large, it would have been more credible and therefore much more suspenseful and satisfying.",4,5,8,18 November 2010
Unknown," Suspenseful and Mysterious
","This would rate as a pretty typical suspense/thriller - which means that there's a lot in it which you just can't take very seriously, but that's OK. It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's to be judged on the basis of how wild the ride is that gets you to the finish, and by that standard this movie works pretty well. There's a lot of mystery, pretty much right off the top, there are people getting killed all over the place and there are two pretty wild car chases through the streets of Berlin. When you add to that a pretty solid cast led by Liam Neeson, you end up with a pretty good and exciting story - a fantasy, certainly, but suspenseful and mysterious, which is what the movie was intended to be.Neeson heads the cast as Dr. Martin Harris, a botanist in Berlin to attend a Conference at which a new strain of corn is to be revealed - one that's resistant to drought and other natural blights and that will help end the world food shortage. But things go wrong from the beginning. He gets into a car accident, ends up in a coma, and when he wakes up no one - not even his wife (played by an actress named January Jones) - remembers who he is, or believes he's Dr. Martin Harris - and in fact there's another Dr. Martin Harris who's taken his place who everyone accepts as THE Dr. Martin Harris. The mystery around his identity takes a lot of twists and turns and keeps the viewer guessing until the mystery is revealed, ultimately leading up to the climax of the movie: a foiled assassination attempt.It's a decent movie; a fun movie to watch. It's not to be taken too seriously. It's to be looked at for its entertainment value in the action/suspense genre. From that perspective, it holds up pretty well. (7/10)",7,2,4,10 July 2011
Ghostbusters," Silly Fun
","This movie about three university professors of parapsychology who open their own ghost-hunting business after being turfed by the university isn't the greatest comedy I've ever come across. To be honest it isn't even close. But it is a fun little movie, if a little bit over-rated, featuring a solid cast and a good story.Everyone does a good job of treating the material seriously enough to make this funny, and pretty much everyone (with the possible exception of Rick Moranis) seems to be playing this 'straight.' I suppose one of the weaknesses I see with this movie is just that - everyone's too much of a 'straight man.' The end result was that I smiled a lot during the movie, and chuckled a few times, but never really burst out laughing at anything.The major stars (Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, Dan Aykroyd, etc.) all moved on to other projects over the ensuing years and, in my opinion, to better performances as well. If that sounds like a criticism, it really isn't. They were all fine in 'Ghostbusters.' It's just that I think their better performances were ahead of them. The one exception might be Moranis, who I mentioned earlier. He is very funny here as the geeky accountant Louis Tully, who is infatuated with Weaver's Dana Barrett, but is also frustrated that she doesn't return his feelings, until, of course, the two get together in the spirit world. Moranis, I think, did some of his best work here. Unfortunately, it was in a limited role.It's a pleasant movie to watch and there's nothing particularly wrong with it. It just didn't blow me away, which is why I give it a 5. In my view, it's a very average comedy.",5,10,20,1 January 2006
Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood At His Best
","It may seem strange to say this about a well-known actor such as Clint Eastwood who's had a lot of successful movies in his career, but I don't think I've ever enjoyed an Eastwood movie as much as I enjoyed this one. Eastwood (who also directed) was perfectly cast as Walt Kowalski, an aging Korean War veteran whose wife has just died as the movie opens, whose family wants little to do with him except to get their hands on his house and his prized 1972 Gran Torino, and who is tormented by the fact that his neighbourhood has been taken over by Asians. Kowalski's racist nature was actually comical (in an Archie Bunker sort of way) but the most impressive thing about Eastwood's performance was how well he portrayed Kowalski's gradual change of heart toward his neighbours, beginning with his unexpected friendship with young Sue (a great performance by Ahney Her) and developing into his role as the neighbourhood's protector against the violent Asian gangs that continually invade the area. In that sense, Eastwood began to resemble an elderly Dirty Harry, with 'get off my lawn' becoming Kowalski's version of 'make my day.' As Kowalski growls his way through his various encounters, first with his neighbours and then with the gangs, you are both appalled and amused by the character. You root for him in his battles with the gang, and finally end up applauding his ingenious and selfless way of getting the bums off the street and protecting his Asian neighbours who, as the last scenes of the movie demonstrate, have become far more his family than his real family had ever been. This is funny, action-packed, emotional at times (especially after Sue is attacked) and, in a strange sort of way for a very violent movie, even uplifting at the end. It's truly a superb piece of work by Eastwood.",9,2,6,22 March 2009
Hero," What Makes A Hero?
","I inevitably compare 'Hero' to 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' because both are Chinese made films, and thus the latter is the only real reference point to which I compare the former. I enjoyed 'Hero' more than I enjoyed 'CTHD,' largely because I thought the story was easier to follow. Like 'CTHD', 'Hero' is filled with beautiful photography, brilliantly choreographed martial arts scenes, and excellent stunt work and special effects. That latter strength, however, is ironically one of the weaknesses I found with both movies. While I'm sure it's a cultural issue, I find the flights of fancy in the martial arts scenes distracting, as people soar through the air and walk on water. To me, that lends an air of unbelievability to the fight scenes, which should be the heart of the movie. Instead, they just come across as fantasy. In this case, though, a very good story helps overcome that problem.The story is set during the time when the ruler of Qin sets for himself the goal of unifying various warring kingdoms and creating a unified nation, which would become China. To do that, he has to overpower the strongest of his enemies, the neighbouring kingdom of Zhao. Zhao is powerful, and has three assassins constantly trying to kill the king, until one day, a low-ranking official named simply Nameless (Jet Li) is brought to court after apparently having defeated all three assassins. He weaves a story to explain how he accomplished this, but the king is suspicious and offers what he believes is the real story. Both stories are told through the use of flashbacks.In the end, as the title implies, we deal with the question of what constitutes heroism. Who is the hero here? The unknown official who apparently vanquishes the assassins? The assassins themselves, fighting for the very existence of their nation of Zhao? The king who understands that the constant warfare and suffering of the people can only be stopped by the even more ruthless warfare required to unify the country? There are a variety of possibilities. It's an interesting story - and an interesting moral question about war and violence. 7/10",7,0,0,30 July 2008
The Hurt Locker," It Failed To Hold My Attention
","This is truly one of those Oscar-winning movies that causes a lot of people to go - 'huh?' A case can be made for Kathryn Bigelow being named Best Director. She managed to portray a gritty and realistic look at modern-day Iraq, and the challenges of the US soldiers stationed there. The subject matter is somewhat unique - I can't think of any other significant movie that's used the Iraq War as its subject matter. But in the end, the story here lets us all down.The movie opens with a great deal of tension. A U.S. Army bomb squad scheduled to be rotated out of Iraq in 38 days has to deactivate a roadside bomb. We have no way of knowing what will happen. You watch, and you're quite into the movie at this point. But it becomes far too repetitive. They deactivate a lot of bombs. There are deaths, and the atmosphere of uncertainty - can anyone be trusted in this insanity - is real, but it's just too much over and over again. None of the characters are well developed. One has a son and one wants a son but that was never taken far enough for me to really care about any of them. There's no particular story being told and there's no real resolution to the movie (which, I admit, is perhaps a pretty good statement about this particular war.) We just watch the countdown until this unit goes home, only, at the end of the movie, to see them replaced by another unit. So, yes, there's the pointless, repetitive cycle of a meaningless and totally unnecessary war being depicted, but frankly after about half an hour my attention was wandering. Best movie? I really have to question that.",5,3,5,31 May 2010
K-19: The Widowmaker," A Realistic Portrayal That Surprisingly Lacks Drama Most Of The Way
","At first - for some reason - I wasn't sure about Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson playing Soviet submarine captains. The roles didn't really seem to suit them for some reason. However, both pulled off good performances here, in a movie that seemed to offer a realistic portrayal of life on a Soviet sub in the midst of the Cold War (1961 to be precise.) Purportedly based on a real incident that came to light only after the fall of communism in Russia, the movie combines the rivalry between the two captains with the story of a nuclear reactor out of control and about to explode (and also manages to include an interesting look at Soviet perceptions of the United States - a perspective often lacking from most American movies.)Perhaps the sheer realism of sub life accounts for what I thought was a general lack of tension for the first 90-100 minutes or so. It must be sheer drudgery for sub crews to go through drill after drill after drill; it's even worse to have to watch them going through drill after drill after drill. At times, the story actually became quite tedious. However, the drama in the last 30 or 40 minutes definitely helped make up for that, and surely - the tedium notwithstanding - the sheer realism of the movie earns it some points.This is a good movie. Not the best ever made, certainly, and not even the best submarine movie I've ever seen (I'd rank 'U-571' and 'Run Silent Run Deep' ahead of it) but still it was worth watching.Overall, I'd rank it as a 7/10.",7,3,4,25 June 2003
The Longest Day," Detailed And Historically Pretty Accurate
","How much you like this movie will depend to what extent you like the genre. If war movies are it for you, then this account of D-Day - the Allied invasion of Normandy (seen from both the Allied and German perspectives) - has to be one of the best war movies ever made. It's realistic and completely believable in every way. If you like the historical epic genre, you'll appreciate this. There was great attention paid to details in putting this together, and as far as I can see it was pretty accurate in those details as well. If you aren't into either of those genres, then this probably wouldn't be of any interest to you.'The Longest Day' features a stand-out cast (figures such as John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Roddy McDowall, Paul Anka, Richard Burton, Red Buttons, - even a young Sean Connery) and the German characters actually speak German (with English sub-titles) which I appreciate, as it does add another heir of authenticity to the story. It's pretty long at almost three hours (and I have to confess that my attention wandered from time to time) but those with an interest in this era of history will want to watch it and will appreciate it. 7/10",7,4,6,25 October 2007
Moulin Rouge!," This Is What All The Fuss Was About?
","I know that people and critics alike loved this movie. I just can't figure out why!OK. There is a bittersweet love story here - if you can fight your way through the innane first twenty minutes or so. But there's nothing particularly original to it. The high-class prostitute (Nicole Kidman) falls for the poor boy (Ewan McGregor), but has 'responsibilities' to the more upper-class man in her life. The thing is dull. It's transparent almost from the beginning. We know how this is going to end. Does it have any redeeming qualities? OK - a couple.Good music. Mostly 80's stuff, but some going as far back as the Beatles. Although, I found the 80's music put into the context of a show in 1900 a bit disconcerting. Still, good selection of music. And the movie should be watched if only to see Zidler and the Duke (Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh respectively) do their rendition of Madonna's 'Like A Virgin.' That did have me laughing, I admit. But I really thought that, overall, this was a rather poor attempt to blend a musical comedy with a Greek tragedy.I'm told that the 1944 version was far superior. Perhaps I'll watch that someday.4/10.",4,0,1,9 January 2002
Slap Shot," An Over The Top Caricature Of Hockey In The 70's
","'What do you mean this is a serious game?' asks the referee to one of the players. 'This is hockey!' That about sums up the movie. It starts out with an amusing scene of a hockey player (played by an actor using an atrocious French-Canadian accent) 'explaining' the rules of hockey to an American TV audience. From that point on the movie becomes a very exaggerated caricature of the game. Made in the era when the 'Broad Street Bullies' (the nickname of the Philadelphia Flyers) were brawling their way to two Stanley Cups, this follows the exploits of the Charleston Chiefs and their player-coach (played by Paul Newman). The Chiefs are perennial doormats in the minor league 'Federal League' and their owner is about to fold the team when Coach Dunlop stumbles upon the key to success - fight and brawl your way to the top - as a way of making the team attractive to potential buyers. There's references to the battle between those who like the new style and those who want to play 'real' hockey 'like Eddie Shore' - presumably a deliberate irony, since Shore was a very dirty hockey player in his era. I thought the movie spent too much time on the players' personal lives, although it made the point about the players' wives having to put up with the dreariness of minor league cities, while the players had to put up with the interminable bus rides. This is somewhat amusing, although the caricature gets taken way too far by the end, when the Chiefs' opponents for the championship change their entire roster the night before the championship game to bring in a bunch of toughs, and the player stripping on the ice at the end was just plain dumb. To its credit, the on ice action (when it was portraying hockey rather than hockey fights) was pretty well done, but overall I didn't care much for this. 3/10",3,7,18,14 February 2010
Patton," 'A Perfect Anachronism'
","These were the words that came (in the movie at least) from German Captain Oskar Steiger (Siegfried Rauch) as he contemplates their arch-enemy, General George Patton (played superbly by George C. Scott). Patton was a figure from a by-gone age, obsessed with military history and battle tactics, not understanding that being a brilliant general was no longer enough in modern warfare - one had to be a diplomat and politician as well, and Patton simply couldn't adjust to those demands even while he remained perhaps the most brilliant combat general of the US Army in World War II.I was a little bit surprised at the portrayal of Patton in this movie. I was under the impression that it portrayed him as almost a mythical figure above reproach; the quintessential American hero at a time (1970, with defeat in Vietnam staring the US in the face) when Americans needed military heroes. While there's no doubt that Patton is portrayed as a brilliant general, his character flaws are shown as well: arrogance and envy over whether he or British Field Marshal Montgomery (Richard Bates) is the more important, hot-headedness: slapping a shell-shocked soldier silly and being forced to publicly apologize under direct orders from Eisenhower, a warmonger-type figure in his attitude to the Russians, and generally chafing under orders that he didn't like (and sometimes not obeying them.) He is certainly a well-developed personality in this movie. Early shots of Scott in the role made me think of a striking resemblance to the swaggering Mussolini (and the displays of arrogance and egotism did the same.)It's a good movie. It has a few weaknesses. It really should be called 'Patton in World War II' because there's really nothing about the man outside the period 1943-1945, the first half of the movie overdoes a few battle scenes at the expense (I thought) of really focusing on Patton, and the whole thing is a little too long for my liking. Basically though it's very good, and features solid supporting performances from Karl Malden as General Omar Bradley (Patton's subordinate who becomes his commander) and Ed Binns as General Bedell Smith. I also appreciated the emphasis on giving us the perspective of the German officers who opposed Patton (in particular Karl Michael Vogler as Field Marshall Erwin Rommel and Richard Munch as General Alfred Jodl) and I thought it added a touch of realism in these scenes to have them spoken in German with subtitles.7/10",7,3,6,1 September 2002
The Illusionist," Eminently Forgettable, If Somewhat Bizarre At Times
","Give 'The Illiusionist' credit for being a pretty good period piece, which seems to recreate Hapsburg Austria pretty faithfully (notwithstanding the fact that there was no 'Crown Prince Leopold' - a character apparently loosely based on the real-life Crown Prince Rudolf) and also for having some pretty strong performances - especially from Edward Norton as Eisenheim, and from Paul Giambatti as Inspector Uhl. Those couple of positive notes, though, weren't enough to save a bizarre and confusing story which tries to mix a magician's tricks with a murder mystery.Essentially, Eisenheim gets entangled in the murder of Sophie (Jessica Biel), a woman engaged to the Crown Prince but who, in the past, was passionately in love with Eisenheim himself. She ends up being murdered, and Eisenheim is convinced that Leopold is responsible. The movie never explicitly identifies Leopold as the murderer, but it is clearly implied. Significant parts of the movie are told in flashbacks, especially near the beginning as the past relationship between Eisenheim and Sophie is portrayed. I thought the story was weak and lacked any real sense of excitement; anything that would grab a viewer and really pull them in. Because of the positive points I mentioned at the beginning, I'll rate this as a 3/10.",3,1,3,12 May 2009
Men in Black II," A Very Weak Sequel
","As funny as the original MIB was, the sequel proves that the same old thing can get very old and very tired very quickly. I mean, how often can you really find it funny to watch an alien grow its head back after having it shot off? This was a cute gag in the original (and I think we only saw it happen once if I remember correctly.) In this one, it happens over and over again. HEY! AFTER THE FIRST TIME IT'S NOT THAT FUNNY! That's the basic problem with this movie. It doesn't seem to have a lot to differentiate it from the first one, with the result that it's just not that interesting.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as Agents 'Jay' and 'Kay' respectively, and here was one element of the story that might have made this a fun adventure if it had been developed. 'Kay' is retired as this movie opens, and he's been 'neuralized' - his memory of having been an MIB agent has been wiped clean. If the story had focussed more on 'Kay' and his attempts at re-integrating into the MIB agency, I think this might have been a very funny movie. But 'Kay's' re-integration just seems to happen far too easily, and for the most part the focus of the movie is on Smith's 'Jay.' The problem with that is that I just feel Jones is better suited to the whole MIB persona, and I felt Smith quickly became tiresome without Jones balancing him more fully. (And Frank the dog - another of Jay's 'partners' - just didn't cut it. I really wanted that dog to get eaten by the big worm or something. A very irritating character, in my opinion.)My advice: stick with the original.3/10",3,49,83,22 January 2003
Hidden Figures," These Women Definitely Had The Right Stuff
","I couldn't help but think of this movie in relation to the 1983 movie 'The Right Stuff.' That film honoured the first seven American astronauts in the Mercury program. This movie honours the vital contributions to that program of African American women - largely behind the scenes and often not getting the credit they deserved. The movie focuses on three women in particular: Katherine Gobel/Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae). All three are brilliant in their respective fields: Katherine as a mathematician, Dorothy as a programmer and Mary as an engineer. All three work for NASA in the early days of the space program as the Mercury program is just beginning, and all three are involved in the vital calculations necessary to launch, orbit and re-enter capsules. In the midst of the work, the women are forced to deal with things such as riding at the back of the bus, segregated bathrooms and the prejudices of their co-workers. Henson and Spencer seemed somewhat more central to the story and offered good performances. Monae - better known as a singer than an actress - seems to fade away a bit compared to those two, but still does a fine job with the role.Truthfully, race was really as central a theme to this movie as was the space race. While it was all set in the context of the space race between the USA and the USSR, it was also set in the early 1960's at the NASA facility that was located in Virginia - a state where segregation was still an accepted and every day fact of life. And, of course, the women are not just African Americans - they're women, and they have to deal with sexism as well - even from some African American males, who don't seem to know what to make of them working in such important jobs. The scenes depicting the reality of life in the south in the era are sobering, and once the Mercury astronauts are introduced there's a lot of tension involved - although much of that is mitigated by the fact that we've seen the astronauts' stories and the basic story of the space flights in 'The Right Stuff.' But it was inspiring to see the contributions of Katherine and Dorothy and Mary and others like them.It's a well done movie. Some of the characters are composite characters. That isn't really a big deal and was probably necessary to give some focus to the movie. Actually, two of the most important NASA figures - Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) and Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) were composites. There were some scenes that were very dramatic but that were created for the movie. Harrison (and since he didn't exist - no one else) never smashed down a 'Coloured Women' restroom sign, for example. It was a powerful scene, but completely made up. I want to suggest that Parsons was a superb choice for the role of Stafford. His role as Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory makes it easy to relate to him as a jealous and arrogant scientist who seems to look down on everyone else's work - and he proved here that he can handle such a character in a dramatic role as well - although if I were Parsons, I might be concerned a bit with the possibility of type casting.It's also a bit jarring in the year 2017 to see the state of technology in the era. I'm a child of the 1960's and grew up without computers, but even so I'm so steeped in today's culture that when I saw the sign 'Coloured Computers' for the first time, I thought how ridiculous it was that even the computers that African Americans used were segregated. It took me a few minutes to realize that the African American women WERE the computers, doing the necessary calculations. NASA was just in the process of having a huge and primitive IBM computing machine built to take over the job of doing their calculations. Seeing people working frantically on all of the complex equations in the movie was a bit disorienting.This is a very deliberately paced movie. It's interesting all the way through. I wouldn't say it's an intense movie very often, but it's a very watchable movie that pays deserved tribute to a largely forgotten but courageous and determined group of African American women who played a vital role in the beginning of America's space program.

Lincoln," It's Good, But A Bit Of A Surprise
","There can be absolutely no doubt at all that the highlight of this movie is the superb performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln. I've seen a number of his movies, and this is without a doubt his best piece of work. He becomes Lincoln in every way. Yes, the makeup is great. He looks the part. Physically he comes across as Lincoln. From everything I've read about Lincoln, he was tall and gangly and a bit awkward in his gait and stride. Day-Lewis got all that. But it was more than just that. I thought he captured the essence of the man. He was quiet and gentle; a soft-spoken story teller with a sense of humour. That was there. He was a political animal, making deals and dispensing patronage freely. This really was a fine portrayal of the man by Daniel Day-Lewis.And yet, strangely enough, the movie didn't overwhelm me. It was good, but I didn't think it was great. It surprised me a bit. I was expecting it to revolve around the Civil War and military matters. Instead, it was almost entirely focused on the fight to get the House of Representatives to pass the 13th amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery. It's primary focus was the political struggle involved with that. In a way, it struck me as a sort of American version of 'Amazing Grace' - which dealt with the fight to get a bill outlawing slavery through the British Parliament. All the major figures were included in the movie, but the point seemed to be that it was the minor players who aren't much remembered by history who gave the votes to pass the amendment, usually because their support was purchased by patronage appointments. There's also a brief but interesting portrayal of the River Queen Conference with Confederate leaders. With that focus, be aware that this movie isn't about Lincoln's life. It's really about the last four months of his life, focusing mostly on the last couple of weeks of January 1865.There were some good supporting performances, especially from Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, and Sally Field as Mary Lincoln, and some hints of the Lincolns less than perfect marriage. Less impressive to me was David Strathairn as William Seward. Another interesting performance in a limited role was Jackie Earle Haley as Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens.This is a good movie by all means, and worth seeing if you're interested in Lincoln or this period in history. It's also a must-see just for the performance of Daniel Day- Lewis. Hype aside, is it the best movie of 2012? Personally I wouldn't go that far. (7/10)",7,1,4,12 January 2013
Rules of Engagement," Gripping Courtroom Drama; Difficult Moral Dilemma; Powerful Movie
","This is an absolutely superb film however you choose to approach it. As a courtroom drama, it is taut with suspense; as a moral statement it raises unsettling questions. There is very little one could identify as being wrong with this movie.Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones offer powerful performances. Jackson plays Marine Col. Terry Childers, who faces a court martial after men under his command kill 83 civilians taking part in a demonstration outside the US Embassy in Yemen. Jones plays his defence attorney, fellow Marine Col. Hayes Hodges, a lawyer with a less than stellar background, whose life was saved by Childers during combat in Vietnam.There are two main storylines in this movie, which weave together perfectly. The first is the actual court martial, which is developed superbly. It is tense and suspenseful and I had no idea which way the verdict would fall until we actually heard it. The moral dilemma involved in the story is very real and very powerful, and can be summed up with a number of questions: (1) what standards should be expected of those in combat situations; (2) can those who have never been under fire in a combat situation really judge the actions of those who have to make difficult decisions in the heat of combat; (3) will the US Ambassador (Ben Kingsley) really sell out the man who saved his and his family's life just to curry favour with his superiors in the State Department? Powerful questions, with answers that aren't entirely clear - but surely that's the point! There aren't always easy answers. The underlying subplot of a government cover-up of evidence led by National Security Advisor William Sokal (Bruce Greenwood) fits in nicely with the rest of the movie.Director William Friedkin does a fantastic job of building up suspense, and his flashback scenes to Vietnam are used to good effect. (I don't always like flashbacks, but these were appropriate and helped move the story along without taking over.) Friedkin's decision to focus on the little girl who had lost her leg during Hodge's trip to Yemen to investigate the incident was poignant and powerful.Is there anything wrong with this movie? Some might complain that it presents a too stereotypical view of the 'bad Moslems,' but if this is the storyline, where else would you set the Embassy incident? At one of those really violent demonstrations that are always breaking out around the US Embassy in Ottawa or Stockholm? But I do have a few minor concerns: I didn't think Greenwood was that well cast as the National Security Advisor; the fight scene between Childers and Hodges struck me as silly and unnecessary; Friedkin introduces tensions in Hodges' family over the case but then never really develops it beyond the initial family discussion over a meal. But these are relatively minor points. Overall this movie is wonderful. Good story, great acting and directing. There's not much more you could ask for.9/10",9,2,5,14 April 2001
Million Dollar Baby," Good Story; Too Many Caricatures For Me
","I can't say that I've ever been interested in women's boxing (I'm not really a fan of any kind of boxing to be honest) but this story did interest me so I gave it a look see. It's a pretty good, traditional kind of 'underdog goes for it' story with a solid cast that held my interest, although I can't honestly say that I was ever on the edge of my seat with any of this.The lead characters are all well played. Hilary Swank surprised me in the role of Maggie Fitzgerald, the 31 year old who decides she wants to be a professional boxer to get out of her life as a waitress. She handled the part very well and was pretty believable. Clint Eastwood played her manager, Frankie Dunn. Personally, I thought he was showing his age a bit here but again he was solid in the role of the over-cautious manager, estranged from his daughter and with some definite secrets in his life. Morgan Freeman, as always, pulled off his part as Eddie Du Pris quite well. He also had probably the funniest lines of the movie: first when he was explaining to Frankie why his socks had so many holes, and then after he KO'd the young fighter who hurt his friend - the mentally challenged 'Danger' (Jay Baruchel) - and said simply 'there's 110' - a reference to an earlier scene when we learned he had quit boxing after 109 fights.The primary thing I didn't like about the movie were the over-the-top caricatures. Danger was one example. There was Maggie's stereotypical hillbilly, welfare family. There was the evil champ (the female Clubber Lang, I guess) who would stop at nothing to stop Maggie from getting her title. I didn't think any of those caricatures were really necessary to the plot, and frankly I found those characters irritating. Aside from that, though, I thought this was pretty good stuff.6/10",6,2,7,24 September 2007
Donnie Brasco," A Good Look At Behind The Scenes Life In The Mob
","'Donnie Brasco' is the name assigned to an undercover FBI agent who's assigned the task of infiltrating the New York mafia and ends up getting farther than anyone ever thought he would manage. Johnny Depp was quite good in the role - one of the few 'straight roles' that I've seen him in, as opposed to the quirky style of character he usually seems to play. Depp had to play his character in two different settings - one as Brasco, the young mobster seeking to work his way up through the mob, and then as FBI agent Joe Pistone, who finds his mob life overtaking his personal life, to the point at which his marriage and family almost break apart under the strain. It was a fine piece of work by Depp, showing the character becoming almost overtaken by his mob persona, and steadily rising within the family to a level not even the FBI expected.Al Pacino was the perfect partner for Depp in this. I don't think anyone could play the role of 'Lefty' - a 'middle management' mob type as well as Pacino. Lefty is a frustrated mobster, unable to advance in spite of many years of service, who recruits Brasco and then finds himself overtaken by the young newcomer to the 'family.' Pacino was completely believable in the role, as you would expect from such an accomplished actor. Depp and Pacino were teamed with a pretty solid supporting cast, the most notable of them being probably Anne Heche as Joe's long- suffering wife Maggie.The biggest weakness in this was probably some poor pacing and structure in the first hour or so. It didn't seem to be fitting together all that well, and it actually seemed to start too abruptly, with Lefty trying to sell Brasco a diamond. How did Brasco get into that position in the first place? I wondered that all the way through. How did his undercover work begin? There also seemed to be a number of points at which Brasco should have been found out, but wasn't. Those points aside, though, this was a very entertaining movie.",7,1,2,18 December 2010
Casualties of War," A Brutal Depiction Of A Brutal Event In A Brutal War
","It seems to me that the ultimate moral of this story might be that in war everyone is a casualty in some way, shape or form - even those who are never wounded and stay personally above the brutality. 'Casualties Of War' is a depiction of an actual (and sickening) event that was first reported in the New Yorker magazine in 1969 in which a squad of American soldiers kidnap, rape and murder an innocent, young Vietnamese girl.The two main protagonists in the movie are played by Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn. Penn is Meserve - the sargeant in command of the squad who develops the plan for the kidnap, rape and murder. He represents one type of casualty - a kid, promoted way beyond his years, in a situation he should never have been in, watching friends and comrades dying on a daily basis, becoming jaded and unfeeling as a result. You feel no sympathy for his character, but you recognize the tragedy of his character - and of the other members of the squad who let themselves be pulled into the plan. Fox, on the other hand, is Eriksson - the squad's conscience. He knows this is wrong, and he refuses to participate, even trying to help the girl escape, only to be derided and ridiculed by the others as either a coward or a homosexual. After the girl is killed, for no real reason, he reports the incident to his superiors, only to hear repeated variations on the theme 'let it go. War is war.' This is probably Michael J. Fox's most powerful movie role ever - a definite change of pace from the teen-oriented comedies that had made him famous. He's also a casualty, of course - haunted forever by the sickening scene he had witnessed. And of course, there's the real casualty - the young girl dragged out of her home and away from her mother who endures a nightmare before being killed.This is most definitely a powerful, disturbing and brutal movie that definitely makes it point.",8,20,20,6 April 2010
Event Horizon," Quite Forgettable Aside From Laurence Fishburne
","Strange. I was hesitant about this film basically because it had Laurence Fishburne playing a spaceship captain. I like Laurence Fishburne. He's a decent enough actor - probably a little under-rated. But I couldn't really see him in that kind of role. He surprised me. I thought he worked quite well as Captain Miller of the Rescue Ship Lewis & Clark, sent to investigate the sudden appearance of a ship (the Event Horizon) that suddenly appears in orbit around Neptune after disappearing seven years before. The truly unfortunate thing was that Fishburne seemed to be the only thing that worked in this. The rest of the cast didn't really capture me, and the story just didn't grab me.The Event Horizon had been testing out a new kind of engine that would allow it to travel faster than the speed of light by essentially bending time. It was lost without a trace. When it reappeared (in the year 2047) Miller's team, which had the scientist who invented the new engine (played by Sam Neill) included, heads off. There seem to be no survivors, but plenty of strange things happen - which are clearly related to this new kind of engine. The crew has strange hallucinations (or are they?) and it turns out that what the new engine has actually done is somehow opened a hole into a new dimension; into some parallel universe that can only be described as hell.It disappointed me. The cast (aside from Fishburne) was weak and the story just simply seemed to get progressively sillier as the movie went on. It's not a great addition to anyone's sci-fi video library.

The Nightmare Before Christmas," Memorably Quirky But Lacking In Substance
","Tim Burton has a history of putting out as either producer or director (he's the producer here) of rather quirky movies, and this may well be his quirkiest. Quirky it definitely is, and unique and original as well. But one can't give a lot of points just for being originally quirky. Somewhere along the way a movie has to entertain; it has to have a strong plot. 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (as intriguing as it is) doesn't do that. There's enough here in terms of story to make maybe a 10-15 minute short film. Stretching it out for over an hour and a quarter is too much. I found the whole thing got tiresome rather quickly.The story revolves around the character of Jack Skellington - a skeleton inhabiting an animated nightmare of a place called Halloween Town. Halloween Town - as the name implies - is totally fixated on Halloween. October 31 is its one and only reason for existing, and it's appropriately populated by a collection of ghosts, goblins and various and assorted other monsters, including Jack - a skeleton who is the pumpkin king. But Jack one night accidentally falls through a door in a tree and discovers Christmas Town - a place as fixated on Christmas as Halloween Town is on Halloween. Fixated by the idea Jack returns home with tales of the place and then chooses to return to kidnap Santa Claus, and then takes his place on Christmas Eve, delivering ghoulish Christmas presents to boys and girls around the world. But when he discovers that his presents haven't brought the joy that the real Santa's presents bring, he resolves to fix things by returning the real Santa to his rightful place, while he returns to his place as pumpkin king.I realize there's an important message here about being yourself, and not pretending to be something that you're not. And watching this and its assortment of memorable characters is certainly an experience. I just didn't think that it made for a very good feature film. (3/10)",3,2,5,4 January 2012
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Important, Relevant And Interesting - But Still A Rather Dry Portrayal Of The Story
","This is an important subject from a historical perspective. The 'red scare' era, where everyone and anyone could be suspected of being a communist simply on the basis of rumours or hearsay, and where lives and careers were ruined because of the sometimes questionable connections that were established, and which gave rise to the otherwise obscure and undistinguished Senator Joseph McCarthy, is a fascinating one. This is even a relevant movie - because to some extent the smear tactics used against communists are being used once again against Muslims today, as politicians try to make names for themselves and win elections by whipping up fear. This is an interesting subject - because it focuses on the work of Edward R. Murrow, one of the greatest reporters of all time, in standing up against McCarthy, and committing himself to bringing the man down. And yet, important, relevant and interesting though it is, this is also a pretty dry presentation.Some people liked the decision of director (and co-star, as producer Fred Friendly) George Clooney to film this in black and white. I suppose there were reasons for it. First because it gave the movie a nostalgic feel (although increasingly there are fewer people who would feel the nostalgia because black and white television isn't even in the memory banks of very many people under the age of 50.) It might be that a political point was being made - the dangers of everything being seen in black and white terms. There are good guys and bad guys and never the two shall mix. To me, and I do have some memories of black and white TV, the black and white was a distraction. It added little to the movie. Overall, beyond the black and white, I thought the story seemed to lack something in the power department. It was very low key - TOO low key for my liking. Obviously I wasn't expecting an action movie, but I was expecting something a bit more dramatic.Not that there weren't many good things about this. First, I liked David Strathairn's performance as Murrow. He portrayed Murrow as I would imagine him - a no nonsense, tell it like it is kind of reporter who's willing to butt heads with the powers that be at CBS if he has to in order to tell it like it is. That certainly led to a critique of television that truly relevant today. To what extent does TV news seek to inform, and to what extent does it exist to entertain? How powerful are sponsors in deciding what can and can't be covered? Worthwhile questions, to be sure. I also appreciated the video clips of McCarthy himself. The movie also portrayed the tragedy of CBS newsman Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) who became himself tainted with communism after choosing to associate himself with Murrow's attacks an McCarthy, and ended up committing suicide - although, in reality, several weeks passed between that incident and Hollenback's death.Too much was made of the relationship between Joe and Shirley Wershba (Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson.) Co-workers at CBS, they were also secretly married, because at the time CBS didn't allow fellow employees of the network to be married. Quaint, perhaps, but I didn't think it warranted the amount of screen time it got.",5,0,0,12 March 2016
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," A Good Movie That Haunts You When It's Over
","I didn't see the end coming at all. To that point, I thought this was a very well done movie, depicting the innocence of an 8 year old boy growing up in the Third Reich who finds himself in the midst of some ugly history-making when his father becomes commandant of a concentration camp. Up to the end I thought this featured great performances, especially from David Thewlis as the cold as ice, duty bound officer who goes about the business of running a concentration camp as if it were like running any business enterprise. The brief scene in which he's sitting at his desk calmly discussing plans for additional crematorium ovens for the camp is especially chilling, because by then, finally, we kind of know what's going to happen. I was also impressed by Vera Farmiga as the angst-ridden mother who wants nothing to do with this gruesome business. Bruno, played by young Asa Butterfield, came across as perhaps a bit too naive, never really figuring out what's going on in the camp even after he begins to be taught by his virulently anti-semitic tutor. His sister Gretel becomes the portrait of an indoctrinated child, who buys the Nazi propaganda fed her by the tutor hook, line and sinker. Until the end, it was pretty good. My biggest criticism of it to that point was that I felt it presented a far too sanitized view of life in the camp, from the glimpses we saw of it. When the final scenes come, though, it ratchets up a couple of notches beyond very good. The ending (which I won't give away) is haunting and chilling and sobering - I can't list all the words that might describe it. All I can say is that in the end a very good movie becomes one that won't get out of your head for quite a while.",9,2,3,1 April 2009
The Imitation Game," Benedict Cumberbatch Offers A Brilliant Portrayal Of A Troubled And Tormented Man
","Benedict Cumberbatch was absolutely superb in this biopic as Alan Turing. Turing was a bona fide war hero - a status achieved not on the battle field, but at home. A mathematical genius, Turing was part of a team that managed to decrypt the coded messages the Germans sent using their 'Enigma' machine, primarily through the use of his so-called 'Turing machine' - which was basically an early, primitive computer. Some have referred to Turing as the father of modern computer science. His hero status aside, however, Turing was a troubled and tormented man. He was socially awkward, isolated, and largely friendless. Although the word is never used in the movie, it seems clear that by modern standards, he was probably autistic. Adding to his torment was the fact that he was also gay in a society that was actively hostile to homosexuals, and in which homosexuality was illegal. I thought Cumberbatch captured the complexities of the man brilliantly.Essentially the movie is presented as a flashback. Turing's homosexuality was discovered several years after the war's end, and the story of his past is told as he's interviewed by a detective. Most of the film is set in Bletchley Park, where the work on Enigma was conducted, and revolves around his troubled relationships with his co-workers on the project, including Joan (played by Keira Knightley) - the one true friend he made, and to whom he was briefly engaged. At times, the flashbacks go back further to his time as a student at a boarding school where he develops the other great friendship of his life - with fellow student Christopher Morcom, who tragically dies of tuberculosis, an event which surely traumatized Turing greatly.The movie follows Turing's life up until its end in 1954 at the tragically young age of 41. The film accepts the official determination that he committed suicide by cyanide poisoning. Having been discovered to be homosexual, he had been given the choice of prison or 'chemical castration' - basically being forced to take estrogen in order to weaken his libido. The movie shows him being despondent and physically shattered by the treatments, leading to his suicide. That thesis isn't universally accepted, though. Some have pointed out that the hormone treatments had ended a year before his death, and that Turing had made some very definite plans for his future work, and he had been engaged in some experiments that could have led to accidental cyanide poisoning. There is even the inevitable conspiracy theory, suggesting that Turing was murdered by British security forces. However, the official verdict is suicide, and none of the other theories was explored or even mentioned. In the end, the film becomes a critique - and an appropriate one - of the decision of previous generations to criminalize homosexuality, noting the thousands of men who had been convicted under the old laws. Finally, in 2013, Turing was posthumously pardoned, and laws have allowed the pardons of several thousand other men similarly convicted.There are some historical points in the movie with which one can quibble, but to do so misses the point that the movie wasn't really about the history of the events (although they are reasonably if imperfectly portrayed) but was instead about Turing's complex and tragic life. Cumberbatch brought the man to life brilliantly, and the writers managed to give us a fascinating glimpse into his mind. It's not an especially exciting movie, but it is a good study of a man who deserves to be better known than he is, since Turing's work on Enigma was kept secret for many years after the end of the war.

Caddyshack," Mark Twain's Line About Golf Works Here
","Jon Peters - the executive producer of Caddyshack - said that 'golfers love this movie.' I can't argue that point for a moment. My father-in-law is a golfer and he loves this movie, and loaned us the DVD to watch it. Unfortunately, I am not a golfer. I lean to the Mark Twain school of thought on the game - 'golf is a nice walk ruined.' Needless to say, I did not love this movie.The best thing I can say about it is that Rodney Dangerfield is only part of an ensemble cast rather than the actual star. That meant that his typical crude, buffoonish character didn't have as much time to grate on me as in some of the movies he's actually starred in (think 'My 5 Wives.') In the time he was on screen he still grated as real estate developer Al Czervik. Three primary subplots very loosely held together what there was of a story here - groundskeeper Carl's (Bill Murray) attempts to dispose of a pesky gopher who's tearing up the greens (the fake gopher also grated on me); caddy Danny's (Michael O'Keefe) attempts to suck up to Judge Smails (Ted Knight) in order to gain a scholarship to university (maybe he should have worked harder in high school?) and the bet between Czervik and Smails. Chevy Chase was also included here as a sort of new age golf ace. The cast didn't blow me away. Dangerfield I've commented on. Murray's work was probably the best in an undemanding role and Chase wasn't bad. O'Keefe was OK. Knight seemed to keep falling into his Ted Baxter persona from the Mary Tyler Moore show. Thinking back to Mark Twain - this movie was a potentially nice 99 minutes ruined! And to think this spawned a sequel! Obviously there are a lot of golfers getting too much sun! 2/10",2,6,15,7 January 2009
From Dusk Till Dawn," This Is One Crazy Movie
","Extremely violent, very bloody, often crude and at times humorous. That about sums this movie up - except that you'd have to add to the list that it's really quite bizarre as well. The first half or so - while violent and bloody - comes across as pretty straight. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play bank robber brothers who are trying to escape from the United States into Mexico after pulling off a job. Much violence ensues, until the brothers finally take an entire family hostage (played by Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) and manage to get across the border into Mexico in the family's RV and then proceed with their hostages to an out of the way bar to meet up with their Mexican contact. This, of course, is where things turn truly weird.It turns out the everyone who works at the bar (the bartenders, the band, the strippers, etc.) are actually vampires - and quite bloodthirsty ones at that. What started as just a place to hang out until they meet up with their contact Carlos becomes an all night bloodbath as they do battle against these creatures and struggle to stay alive. The first half was actually pretty good, but for me the second half ruined it. This might have worked well as just the story of a couple of violent and perhaps insane bank robbers who try to escape from the law. The vampire thing (even though that's how the movie is sold) was completely overdone and to me at least became very tiresome after a while. How many times do we have to watch a vampire getting a stake through the heart or burned with holy water? Well, according to this movie, we have to watch it a lot! Although I usually like vampire themed movies this one was just too weird to really be of much appeal to me, although it might appeal to action-oriented teens.I will add a word about George Clooney. I generally don't care much for his movies. It's seemed to me that the bigger he's become in Hollywood the less passion he's putting into his work, most of which I would say is characterized by a total lack of energy or enthusiasm. This was different. I liked him in this role - perhaps because this was still while he was a TV star trying to become a movie star, he put more into it. Whatever it was, this may have been the best performance I've seen him give in a movie. Unfortunately, it had to happen in a movie I didn't care much for. (3/10)",3,4,10,4 July 2011
The Last Emperor," The Life Of China's Last Emperor
","This is somewhat long and generally lacking in excitement, but it's beautifully filmed and it serves as a fascinating look at the life of Pu Yi - the last Emperor of China, who came to the throne in 1908 when he was three years old, and finally died in 1967 as a gardener in Communist China, after serving 10 years in a PRC prison being ideologically 're- educated.' Much of the story is told in flash-backs taken from his interrogation by Communist officials in the PRC prison. Much attention is paid to Reginald Johnston's book 'Twilight in the Forbidden City.' Johnston (played in the movie by Peter O'Toole) was Pu Yi's Scottish tutor.John Lone's performance as Pu Yi was very good. Not surprising perhaps for someone who became an emperor at such a young age, Pu Yi is depicted as one who is used to comfort and used to having his way - a characteristic he seems to have retained for most of his life, although he doesn't really come across as bad or arrogant; just as someone who never learned how to care for himself or treat others as equals. I suppose it would be hard to expect a child who was treated almost like a god from the age of 3 to grow up psychologically well adjusted. He was actually overthrown not much more than a decade after coming to the throne but I appreciated learning that although he abdicated when the Nationalist revolution took place, he retained his title and it seems as though the Forbidden City remained his 'Empire.' He continued to rule this little enclave within Beijing, much as the Pope rules a little enclave within Rome. That was very interesting.There was a lot of attention to Pu Yi's accession as 'Emperor of Manchukuo' in 1934. He became a puppet of the Japanese, who placed him on the throne to give Manchukuo a semblance of credibility but no freedom, was captured by the Soviets at the end of the war, and finally handed over to PRC officials in 1950, his transfer to Chinese authority being where the movie begins.Near the end of the movie there's a truly fascinating scene depicting a small portion of the work of Mao's 'Red Guards' during the so-called Cultural Revolution that was quite sobering. I was disappointed, though, with the way this ended. It chose to conclude on a sort of fantasy scene, where Pu Yi returns to the Forbidden City. I suppose it was meant as a way of saying that at his death he returned home, but I found it a weak ending rather than a heartwarming one, perhaps because while his life was interesting, I can't say that I developed any warm feelings or sympathy for Pu Yi by watching this.",6,14,23,28 August 2010
Paranormal Activity," A Ho-Hum Pretend Documentary
","First question: did the world really need another haunted house style of movie? I don't think so, although I suppose I can't argue with the fact that this movie has had decent reviews. And in fairness, given the very small budget it worked with it does what it does reasonably well. Still, I can't honestly describe this as a particularly good movie. To be blunt, the gimmick is getting a bit stale. It's filmed like 'The Blair With Project' or 'Cloverfield,' a pretend-documentary shot with a hand-held camera (or, for the night scenes, a stationary camera) supposedly documenting the strange things happening in the house where Katie and Micah live. Katie has apparently had a history of these experiences, Micah inherited them so to speak when he moved in with her. I liked both of the afore-mentioned movies, so I can say that I have no particular problem with the style. This movie does little to draw the viewer in, though. For the first half hour very little happens, we spend a lot of time watching video being shot and then fast forwarded, there's a few mild chills - but nothing really exciting or frightening or shocking happens until the last fifteen minutes or so. I won't give the ending away, except to say that the very last scene struck me as silly, and it sets us up for a sequel that is apparently to be released in the fall of 2010. Frankly, the idea of a sequel doesn't get me enthused. This one was quite a disappointment.",3,1,2,11 August 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," Some Reflections On Free Will & Predeterminism
","'The Adjustment Bureau' has some interesting reflections on the idea of human free will, couched in a quasi-religious atmosphere, and it is at times thought-provoking if not, in my opinion, all that deep an exploration of the subject. Essentially the first question is whether there are limits to free will and, if so, what the limits are. The answer is that of course there are limits to free will. The fact that I have free will is somewhat limited by your free will. I may be able to make choices, but to some extent my choices are going to be dependent on your choices. Our free wills both complement and challenge one another's. So, there are obvious limits to free will. From the movie's perspective the question is of both free will and 'predeterminism' (the idea that all things are planned; that there are no coincidences.) The movie doesn't go that far. It acknowledges that there are small matters over which we do have free will (such as what kind of toothpaste we use) but it also makes clear that our lives are part of a larger plan, and that adjustments will be made to our actions in order to ensure that the plan gets carried out.There's the obvious religious overtone to this. Who's in control of the plan? In the movie it's 'The Chairman' - assisted by secret agent, 'Men in Black' looking types (represented primarily by Anthony Mackie and Terence Stamp.) The question is 'who's The Chairman?' The obvious answer might be God, with the 'agents' then being angels whose job is to ensure that whatever the cosmic plan is gets fulfilled. I wondered, however, from a fairly early point whether this was some sort of computer simulation game, with the Chairman being the programmer and the agents being a sort of anti-virus component that repairs the program is it gets messed up. The movie never really makes clear what's going on in that respect.That decision to leave a lot of things up in the air is probably the movie's biggest weakness. What was going on was never really resolved. Overall, though, I liked the movie. It wasn't particularly fast-paced, but Matt Damon and Emily Blunt were likable leads who worked pretty well together. I would think of this movie as a diversion far more than a masterpiece. (6/10)",6,0,1,30 October 2012
World Trade Center," Its Power Is In Its Simplicity
","Bearing such a grandiose title, one almost expects a grandiose treatment of the events surrounding the attacks on and collapse of the World Trade Centre on September 11, 2001. Instead, one ends up watching a movie that in many ways is very simple and straightforward, and surprisingly human and personal; a story of survival in the midst of the impossible. On 9/11 Port Authority police officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno are among hundreds deployed to the Trade Centre. As they go about their job of trying to evacuate people, the Towers collapse and McLoughlin and Jimeno are trapped deep in the rubble, hurt and struggling to find some way to survive the insane situation they're in - described by Jimeno at one point as like being in hell. In the end, the movie isn't really even about the attempt to rescue them. There's really very little attention focused on the rescue effort. Instead, the movie goes back and forth from McLoughlin and Jimeno to their families, watching the drama unfolding on television, and having no idea whether they're alive or dead or will even ever be found.This very simple, human focus was probably what this movie needed to make it a success. If you really want a movie dealing with the events of 9/11, you won't like this - or at least you'll be disappointed by it. I tend to be of the opinion, though, that even now - almost seven years after the attack - we're not ready for a completely Hollywood-ized dramatization of 9/11. Human stories are still the way to go. The other significant movie dealing with 9/11, of course, is 'United 93.' It's a very different movie than 'WTC,' but with the same personal, human focus, and also based on a true story from 9/11. To compare the two, I'd say '93' was better, but 'WTC' is also a worthy treatment of that tragic day. 8/10",8,1,3,14 June 2008
Black Hawk Down," Graphic Depiction Of A Country In Chaos
","Based on the true story of the 1993 deployment of U.S. Forces in Somalia, supposedly to keep order, this film is an interesting and very graphic account of what happened in those months that led up to a total U.S. withdrawal from the region. While the movie makes clear that some sort of 'policing' force was necessary to try to establish at least a semblance of order in this completely chaotic and starvation-riddled country ruled by rival warlords, it also clearly questions the effectiveness of the U.S. forces, points out the tensions between the U.S forces and the Pakistani U.N. peacekeepers and demonstrates the uncalled for bravado of some of the American soldiers, who seemed to think this was going to be fun. In the end we see a horrific example of urban warfare as U.S. soldiers have to rescue the crew of a Black Hawk helicopter that was shot down. At the same time, one has to admire the commitment of the Americans to ensure that 'no one gets left behind' - even those who were killed.The cast is clearly secondary to the story here. No one was going to win a best actor award because of that. Not that there weren't good performances, but in the end I really didn't think about the actors. The movie is a little slow starting (although in the first five or ten minutes there's a good introduction to the situation in Somalia) but once the action begins it is chilling. As I said, the violence is extremely graphic. This is not a movie to watch with your seven year old. But it is a very good movie.8/10",8,0,0,23 January 2003
Prisoners," An Excellent & Suspenseful Thriller
","This is certainly the textbook definition of an edge of your seat movie. It's got a lot of suspense, and plot twists galore so that from the very beginning you're never really sure who is or isn't guilty, and the ultimate revelation of that caught me at least completely by surprise. As a result of that, this can also be a bit confusing at times, but it's never a movie that you lose interest in.The basic story revolves around the search for two young girls who have gone missing without a trace. The families are friends, and are fully involved in the search. There's a prime suspect, but no definite evidence against him. The movie is not just a story about the search for the girls. It's also a study of how far people are prepared to go when they're desperate.Hugh Jackman was excellent as Keller Dover - one of the desperate fathers, who takes his desperation to the extreme. Paul Dano also did well as the prime suspect - the mentally challenged Alex. Unlike others, I really wasn't that taken with Jake Gyllenhaal as the detective in charge of the case. For me, he really didn't seem to work in the role.Overall, though, this is an excellent and suspenseful thriller. (8/10)",8,1,2,6 March 2014
For Love of the Game," A Truly Fine 'Baseball' Love Story
","I'm not a huge fan of baseball (I tune in to a few games a year and the World Series) so I approached this movie with some apprehension, but was pleasantly surprised. This is an interesting and moving story.Kevin Costner is excellent as Billy Chapel, a 19 year veteran pitching the last game of his career as a Detroit Tiger at Yankee Stadium. Once a star, Chapel has been plagued by arm problems, and before the game his girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) informed him that she was leaving. With all these conflicting emotions, and in significant physical pain, Chapel manages to string together the best performance of his career, shooting for a perfect game. As the game progresses, Chapel reflects on his life, his up and down relationship with Jane and the struggles in his career.I warn you - the love story is a bit sappy in places, and the whole 'last game might be a perfect game' scenario is perhaps a bit too romanticized. The ending is also quite predictable. Having said that, it's an enjoyable movie; maybe the best baseball movie since 'Pride of the Yankees.'I rated it 8/10",8,1,2,14 April 2001
Hotel Transylvania," Blah! Blah! Blah!
","To be perfectly honest I have to admit that this put me to sleep and I missed a good chunk of it. We were looking for a family movie to watch with our daughter. I had heard good things about this, our daughter (who's 8) had mentioned wanting to see it, so we rented it. She may have enjoyed it. She laughed a handful of times and, as far as I know, she stayed awake. Frankly, it did nothing for me.It was rather frenetic at the beginning - too much so for my liking. It struck me as being sort of Monsters, Inc. after drinking one too many Red Bulls. The story (of Dracula as an overprotective father wanting to protect his daughter from the outside world) was paper thin. The reversal of roles was a bit cute. In this, the monsters are hidden away from the real world because they're afraid of humans. It was pretty obvious where this was going to go, so there was little to really hold my interest.Altogether, I found this disappointing. I can't completely write it off, because my daughter did laugh that handful of times, but I'd still say that it was much weaker than I was hoping for. (3/10)",3,2,6,21 February 2013
The Insider," Gripping All The Way Through
","There's hardly a flaw in this true account of the 60 Minutes expose of a tobacco industry cover-up.Al Pacino is brilliant as Lowell Bergman, the 60 Minutes producer who struggles to convince former tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand (equally brilliantly played by Russell Crowe) to grant an interview in the face of the industry's attempts to silence him, and then has to fight CBS management to put the interview on the air. This is just a marvelous film.From the beginning scenes of the setting up of an interview between Mike Wallace (played by Christopher Plummer, who does a valiant job in a difficult role, playing someone as well known as Wallace) and an Arab sheik involved with the Hezbollah movement we get a sense of the point to come: that dealing with Middle East terrorists is a lot safer than taking on the tobacco industry! We're also hit right off the top by the irony underlying everything. Wigand, who worked as a senior executive for a tobacco company, is a health care specialist with a seriously asthmatic daughter.The first part of the movie plays like a spy thriller, as it focuses on the threats made against Wigand and family to silence him, and the pressure this puts on his family life as we literally see the man begin to crumble under the pressure. The focus of the second half shifts to Bergman's desperate attempts to get Wigand's interview broadcast after everything he has risked to blow the whistle. The battle between Bergman and CBS, also under pressure from the industry not to air the story, and vulnerable due to the network's impending sale, is well portrayed.This movie is absolutely worth the watching. It is vaguely ominous as we're confronted by the power not just of the tobacco industry, but of big business in general. Definitely a 9 out of 10.",9,2,3,23 March 2001
Quiz Show," An Interesting Study Of TV Corruption, But Strangely Lacking In Intensity
","In the late 1950's the TV game show 'Twenty-One' was rigged. Popular contestants who could grab ratings were fed the questions and answers, and those who the network wanted off were told to take dives, all for the sake of keeping ratings up and selling Geritol. 'Quiz Show' is the story of the scandal, and of the potential danger of the power of television. The movie focuses around two contestants in particular: Herbert Stempel (John Turturro), the reigning champ at the start of the movie who the network decides it wants to dump in favour of someone more glamorous who can pull in higher ratings: Charles Van Doran (Ralph Fiennes), a college literature professor. Stempel feels cheated of the glory that he feels was his due, while Van Doran is tormented by his desire to tell the truth, but also to cover up his involvement in the scandal.This is an interesting film that gives a fascinating look at the inside workings of the TV game show of that era. And it does paint a fascinating moral dilemma. As Dan Enright (David Paymer) - Twenty-One's producer - says to the Congressional committee that investigates the scandal, this was after all just a TV show; by definition a piece of entertainment. The sponsor sold its product, the network got ratings, the contestants made money and the public got entertained. Where was the victim? And yet it WAS dishonest. It's a fascinating issue, this whole concept of a victimless crime. And the ultimate irony was summed up by Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), the head Congressional investigator: the Committee got Van Doran, but what he wanted was to get television. In the end, as he says, television will probably end up getting them.All in all this was an interesting movie, although - strangely for a true story - I felt it lacked any sustained dramatic intensity. Remembering Jack Barry from the 1970's as host of the game show 'The Joker's Wild' (he was also the host of 'Twenty-One'), I was very impressed by Christopher McDonald's portrayal of him. Although the role wasn't really that central to the movie, McDonald had Barry down pat, and I felt as if it really were Jack Barry I was watching.All in all, this is a very good movie. I wouldn't run out and buy it, but it's certainly worth a rental.7/10",7,9,10,11 August 2003
"Girl, Interrupted"," Good Cast In A Very Average Movie
","Winona Ryder stars as Susanna Kaysen in this movie adapted from the real Kaysen's book about her stay in a psychiatric hospital in the late 1960's after a suicide attempt.Ryder puts on a generally good performance, but is outshone by Angelina Jolie, playing Lisa, Kaysen's sometimes friend and sometimes tormenter. Jolie's performance was powerful. Most of the supporting cast (who generally play the parts of other residents) is solid, but tend to fade into the background for the most part behind Ryder and Jolie. I thought Whoopi Goldberg was strangely cast in a rather limited role as the head nurse of the institution, who consistently challenges Kaysen to get better and get out of the place.In spite of the generally good performances, though, the story was a bit slow-moving. There were some very powerful scenes, but we seem to have to endure long stretches of relative boredom to get to them. The plodding storyline does move, however, to a strong climax. We just have to wait far too long to get there! Overall, I can't say this is any better than a very average movie, and I would rate it as a 5/10.",5,2,2,9 March 2001
War Machine," A Reflection On A Futile And Pointless But Costly War
","It's hard to know how to characterize this movie. Is it a comedy? A dark comedy? A satire? A war movie? Some combination or permutation of any combination of those and more? But whatever it is - I liked it! I thought it was a very well done spin on what really is the absolutely futile US war in Afghanistan - a country that never actually attacked the United States and a country that no empire (not the British, not the Soviet and not the American) has ever been able to conquer. It revolves around the character of Gen. Glen McMahon - known as 'The Glenimal.' He's a well known, high powered General who supposedly had great success in Iraq (?) using his strategy of SNORPP - 'Systemic Negation Of Repetitive Procedural Practice.' So they try to reproduce his strategy in Afghanistan - with no results. McMahon (played well by Brad Pitt) runs up against US troops who don't want to be there and who have no real idea why they're there or what they're supposed to do, Afghan troops who are lazy, drug addicted and completely uncommitted, allies who aren't willing to do much of anything - countries who've committed no more than a handful of soldiers, and then McMahon's visit to Europe - where France commits more troops (as long as they're not there for very long) and where Germany sends more troops (but won't allow them to leave the base.) Ben Kingsley offers a sadly accurate (in a satirical sort of way) portrayal of Afghan President Hamid Kharzai - who seems uninterested in anything at all. Karzai has a sort of 'just let the Americans do it and leave me out of it' approach, but also shows that he gets the reality of the situation early on when, in a meeting with McMahon where the General details his 'new direction,' Karzai responds, 'Sounds a lot like the old direction.' And there's mutual contempt between American military and civilian leaders, up to and including the Obama White House. BINGO!But for all that, the movie - through McMahon's strategy - makes some valid points. McMahon seems to understand that the reason you have insurgents is because you've invaded somebody else's country. And that you don't win wars by killing civilians. When you do that you only make more insurgents - thus, his mathematical formula for insurgency: if you have 10 insurgents and you kill 2, you don't have 8 insurgents, you have 20 because all the friends and relatives of the insurgents you killed become insurgents in response. In the end what was left was an increasing number of insurgents, an international coalition that just wanted out of this hell hole, centred on American troops who had no idea what they were supposed to do in this hell hole, led by an American General who understood some of the realities of this hell hole but couldn't stop the cycle.I suppose in the end that's the over-arching message of the movie: this is a cycle. Commanding Generals come and go, and each new General replacing a predecessor who failed to get it done as the guy who going to get it done, but he doesn't and ends up replaced by a new General who's going to get it done - and so on, and so forth, ad infinitum. It's told mostly as a reflection on a Rolling Stone article - the writer narrates some of the story, and the balance of the story is about the reaction to the article, which offers details of some of the unflattering thoughts of McMahon and his entourage toward the US administration.I really liked this movie. It's based on a book detailing the story of General Stanley McChrystal, who was appointed to the command in Afghanistan by President Obama. I thought it might have been just a little bit too long. The basic point (why does the US seem to be constantly at war and why does the US keep fighting wars that it can't win) could have been made more succinctly perhaps - but I'd call this a hard-hitting and pretty biting satire, that works - as does any good satire - on the basis that it's pretty much totally believable.

The Graduate," A 60's Classic
","This is a 60's movie, so I have to begin by expressing appreciation for the 60's music. Three of the great Simon & Garfunkel songs are here: 'The Sound of Silence,' 'Scarborough Fair' and, of course, 'Mrs. Robinson.' It's interesting, though, that that last song really isn't the central song of the movie - that would probably be 'The Sound of Silence.' Those songs alone made this an enjoyable movie to spend time with. Songs aside, though, this is also just a really good movie - a must see if you like movies from the 60's. It's a kind of coming of age story, replete with family drama, comedy and great performances.Dustin Hoffman and Ann Bancroft are superb as the leads - Hoffman as the young Ben Braddock, just graduated from university and with no real idea where life is going to lead him, and Bancroft as the older Mrs. Robinson, a woman in a passionless marriage who seduces Ben. The seduction scenes are really quite funny. Hoffman did a great job portraying the awkwardness and uncertainty Ben felt as he found this woman, who has been a friend of his family forever from his perspective, suddenly looking to him for more than just friendship. There's a lot of sensitively funny material in the first hour of the movie, which largely revolves around this relationship: from the first seduction, to Ben renting a room for them, to the scene in which he insists that they have a conversation before 'doing it.' The dialogue was witty, and the performances completely believable. There's a superbly executed shift in genre (for lack of a better word) in the second hour, as Ben finds himself becoming interested in Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (a really good supporting performance by Katharine Ross.) The movie takes on a dramatic feel here, as Ben's feelings for Elaine complicate and then end the affair with her mother, as the secret comes out and lies are told in an attempt to cover up. I've rarely seen a movie switch so seamlessly from light comedy to drama. It was pulled off without a hitch by director Mike Nichols. The question in the end becomes whether Ben can convince Elaine to continue their relationship after she learns about the affair with her mother, and there's some real uncertainty about that. The ending of the movie comes across in some ways as a bit cliché, although there's an openness to it as well as you wonder what awaits Elaine and Ben after all they've experienced.From an era in which there was a lot of uncertainty about the future, this movie seems to encapsulate that feeling through a series of believable characters, whose own futures are left completely up in the air as the movie ends. Sometimes a movie leaving a lot of loose ends can be frustrating, but in this case it seemed completely appropriate to both the story and the times in which it was made.",8,1,1,6 September 2010
Puss in Boots," Fun, But Maybe Too Many Fairy Tales Packed Into One Story
","Spun off from the 'Shrek' series of movies, where Puss was one of the many fairy tale characters who made appearances, Puss now takes on centre stage in a movie of his own, which also revolves around the weaving together of many, many (perhaps even too many!) fairy tale characters in what was a fun kind of adventure - some of which was probably a little too advanced for the children in the audience, but somewhat surprisingly the audience in the theatre I was in had a lot of adults, some of whom didn't seem to be there with children, so the movie clearly appeals to a broad spectrum.I enjoyed it. It was pretty well animated, the action/adventure was a good ride and there were a lot of laughs. The theatre was rarely silent; people were enjoying themselves. I did think, though, that the movie tried to incorporate too much. The Shrek movies used a lot of fairy tale characters, but they mostly revolved around Shrek's own and unique story. Here, we have a mish-mash of fairy tales with overlapping stories where everything gets blurred - and the story of Puss In Boots isn't consistent with the character's history, dating back to the 17th century, when the story was first published in France. The primary secondary character is Humpty Dumpty - who's portrayed as a shifty kind of character, with a lifelong (if love-hate) relationship with Puss. The story revolves around the search for magic beans that are in the possession of an old and very tough-looking couple of thieves named Jack and Jill. Once Puss and Humpty get the magic beans - guess what! They grow into a giant beanstalk that leads to the clouds, where Humpty and Puss - and Kitty Softpaws (Puss's love interest) find not a giant (he's dead) but do come across a baby goose that lays golden eggs, and they bring her back down, only to incur the wrath of her giant mother. You get the point. Mish-mash kind of sums it up. The giant Mother Goose running amok through the town was the point at which I thought this really went overboard.But I can't deny that most of the way through this was fun - and I can't deny the laughs that it brought forth from me and from others around me.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A Beginning That Never Seems To End Followed By An Ending That Never Seems To Begin
","After almost 20 mind-numbingly incomprehensible minutes that seemed so much longer, it comes as a shock to realize that what one is suddenly seeing floating across the screen is (after 20 minutes, remember) the 'opening' credits of the movie. This can mean only one thing - and it isn't good news: sweet Jesus, there's still an entire movie to come.I confess that I'm not entirely enamoured of Jim Carrey. I've seen him as a weak part of a good movie (Bruce Almighty) and as the strong part of a weak movie (The Grinch Who Stole Christmas). Either way, he doesn't turn my crank. I don't think I'd ever watch a movie just because the star was Jim Carrey. To be honest, in 'Eternal Sunshine ...' I'm not sure if he's strong or weak, but it really doesn't matter because the story is absurd, disjointed and not really all that interesting. It had potential. The whole 'erasing negative memories' had a vaguely Orwellian tone to it that intrigued me (which is why I rented it) but in the end it failed badly. When I find myself hoping (even yearning) for a movie to come to an end, I know it's been a disaster.The most intriguing thing about this movie is the following statement right off the DVD jacket it came in: ['Eternal Sunshine ... is] a memorable film that the Wall Street Journal calls 'a romantic comedy unlike any other.' I can't argue with that - it is 'memorable' (no matter how hard I'll try to, I don't think I'll ever be able to forget it) and it is 'a romantic comedy unlike any other.' Give thanks for small mercies - this truly is one of a kind, and, in truth, there must never be another like it. 1/10",1,40,95,10 February 2008
Taken," Fast Paced And Exciting - But Maybe A Bit Too Easy
","I generally like Liam Neeson's movies very much, and in 'Taken' he does not disappoint. He plays Bryan Mills - a father and ex-security agent of some kind - whose daughter is kidnapped by human traffickers while visiting Paris and who is about to be sold into sexual slavery. Bryan finds out about it (perhaps a bit too easily - he happens to be talking to his daughter on the phone from LA when the kidnappers take her) and immediately heads off to Paris to find her.There's nothing confusing or complicated about the story. It's a straightforward account of Bryan's search for his daughter. It has pretty much everything you'd want in an action movie (including hand to hand combat, gunfights and car chases) and once the kidnapping takes place it pretty much is non-stop action. One of the problems I found with this was that - in spite of the action - it all did seem rather to easy. Bryan is told from the start that in dealing with this type of activity he has about 96 hours to find his daughter before she disappears forever. To meet that deadline everything does fall into place rather too easily, and there's the always present unbelievability of the fact that no matter how many bad guys Bryan is up against he always comes out on top (they can take many shots at him - even when he doesn't seem to be covered - and do no damage, while one shot from Bryan is all that's needed.) Perhaps Bryan comes across too much as a super-hero sort. That aspect of unbelievability aside (and I concede that it's necessary to make this kind of movie) the story is plausible. Unfortunately, young girls do get kidnapped and forced into prostitution or sex slavery of various kinds. That aspect of the story (especially as Bryan comes across young girls drugged up and helpless - and who he can't take the time to rescue because he needs to find his own daughter) is actually quite disturbing. This is a good, fast-paced movie that tends to get stronger as it moves along.",7,0,0,22 February 2011
Alice in Wonderland," A Burton-Depp Disappointment
","Here we have yet another in the seemingly never-ending Tim Burton-Johnny Depp partnerships. Unfortunately, here we do not have one of the stronger Tim Burton-Johnny Depp partnerships. 'Alice in Wonderland' stands as a disappointment when all is said and done, in spite of the fact that it has a number of things going for it, not the least of which is - well - Burton and Depp. The movie lends itself to each in their classic styles. Depp gets to play another in his huge repertoire of unusual characters (in this case, he's the Mad Hatter) while re-creating Wonderland is a perfect match with Burton's quirky directorial style, and he does so with the typical Burton touch. Wonderland becomes a very dark and ominous place in this movie. In addition to these two main figures, there are pretty good performances from Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen ('off with his head!') and Mia Wasikowska was fine as a 20-year old Alice who's about to become engaged as the story begins (the movie is essentially an account of Alice re-visiting Wonderland.) I haven't seen much of Wasikowska's work. I can't say she blew me away in the role, but she also didn't drive me away! The animated effects were also pretty good.The whole thing fails though at the basic but obviously vital level of story. It's quite frankly not all that interesting, and certainly much could have been done with the delightfully larger than life characters that Lewis Carroll created so long ago. While understanding, of course, that Alice is the title character, I thought Depp's Mad Hatter was unfortunately under-used for the most part. I also found the connections between Alice's almost-engagement at the beginning and end of the movie strangely disconnected from everything that happened in between. What was the need to have her almost engaged to Hamish? What purpose did that serve? What plot point did it advance? Perhaps, I suppose, that Alice needed to escape from an undesirable situation, and retreating to Wonderland allowed her to do that, but the connection was tenuous at best. I appreciated the obvious effort that everyone put into this, but the end result was still largely disappointing.",4,1,2,5 September 2010
Avatar," An Absolutely Stunning Film That Leaves You Breathless
","I'm not sure that film-making can get any better than this. I have a gut reaction to want to dislike James Cameron's blockbusters. I avoid them like the plague for the longest time before finally deciding to give in to the hype and check them out. Years ago I had that gut reaction to 'Titanic' and then was completely blown away when I watched it. I've had the same experience with 'Avatar' - a movie that I had no interest in watching, but now that I have has left me breathless. It's Cameron's best work ever - superior even to 'Titanic,' which I loved once I watched it.The film is visually stunning in many ways. The world of Pandora (a moon of a distant gas planet) comes to life in every way, from the Na'vi tribe around whom the movie revolves to the various animals that inhabit the world to the trees and the sky - it was all real. The animation and computer-generated characters used to portray the Na'vi were breathtakingly real. There's only a hint every now and then (usually in their movement and not in their appearance) that these are in fact computer-generated characters and for the most part it's easy to forget that these aren't actors in makeup. The visuals alone make this a must-see and even if the story had been lacking would have made this a worthwhile movie. But the story wasn't at all lacking.Cameron (who also developed the story and wrote the script) created an emotionally moving story that pulls no punches and hits a number of buttons so that the viewer gets the underlying message but never feels preached at. It's an epic adventure movie that reminds us of some of the tragedies of our own history and warns us of some of the dangers in our own future. The first parallel that came across to me was the clash of cultures. I immediately thought of the tragic encounters between native Americans and Europeans of centuries ago from which native Americans still haven't recovered. The story revolves around a team of scientists and marines sent to Pandora to study the planet but (and more importantly) to mine the planet for an ore that's worth an astronomical price back on earth. Greed overcomes curiosity quickly, and the marines begin to play centre stage almost from the beginning, as it becomes obvious that the 'company' financing this mission is willing to go to any lengths to get this precious metal. They'll make cursory attempts to talk the natives off the land, but if that doesn't work (and one gets the distinct impression that they don't really want it to work) they're quite prepared (and even eager) to force the natives off the land and kill them if necessary. Sound familiar? The next parallel (or rather, mirror image, I suppose) was the reverse take on 'alien invasion' movies. Here, it's clear that we're the alien invaders, simply looking to rape a world of everything in it that's valuable with no regard or concern for the world's indigenous inhabitants. It's interesting to see humanity portrayed in a different light.The aspect of the story that I appreciated the most, I think, was the extremely spiritual nature of the film. The Na'vi have a connection with creation that is deeply moving and that draws the sympathy of the viewer almost from the beginning - sympathy turning to anger as humans begin to destroy the world that the Na'vi are so interconnected with. The spirituality of this clan and of how it affects their interactions with the world, with each other and with these alien invaders is truly interesting to watch as it's slowly unfolded for us. This is not a Hollywood movie that disses spirituality. Instead, it seems to cut to the heart of spirituality and to what spirituality should be about - the building of community and of relationships, and the glue that holds those things together. Very much related to this is a soft-sell but noticeable if you pay attention environmental message. As the Na'vi see their world being plundered, the point is made that these humans have already done away with all 'the green' on their own planet and are now going to do the same to Pandora, and - at the end - as the marines pull out, the point was made that they were returning to 'their dying world.' It never felt like a 'preachy' environmental message to me, but it was obvious and well made - perhaps making the point more effectively than if it had been the centre point of the story.The performances here were great. Sam Worthington as Jake Scully is a character to root for. He's the paraplegic marine who inhabits a genetically engineered Na'vi body (his avatar) and - as he comes to know the tribe - becomes increasingly sympathetic to them, to the point of wanting to be one of them. Zoe Saldana was great as Neytiri - the Na'vi female with whom Jake falls in love - and Sigourney Weaver was convincing as Dr. Grace Augustine, the head scientist who gradually comes to realize that science is the least concern of the company that has sent her and her team to Pandora. Perhaps the best performance, though, was that of Stephen Lang as Colonel Quaritch - the commander of the marine unit. He was gung ho about taking over the world, ice cold with no sympathy at all for or interest in the Na'vi. He was truly a frightening character. For a movie that is in many ways very gentle and spiritual, it also leads up to a stunningly portrayed final battle scene as the Na'vi take on their human invaders, and to a marvellous final confrontation between Jake and Quaritch.This is a brilliant movie; truly, in my opinion, one of the best ever made.",10,3,7,12 February 2011
Chariots of Fire," Sometimes Inspiring; Sometimes Just Tedious
","This is the true story of Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddle, two of Britain's finest runners going into the 1924 Paris Olympics.Somehow I had never see this movie before. There are some very fine moments in it. Liddle's religious convictions are to be admired; it's too bad that there aren't athletes today willing to take stands based on principle rather than on greed. Abraham's fierce determination to win is demonstrated well by Ben Cross.It should be a great movie; most thought it was. But it didn't really catch me. Moments of great inspiration, yes. But not enough. So much of the movie I simply found tedious. Stretches of boredom leading up to moments of excitement. I'm left wondering what the hype was all about.5 out of 10.",5,3,8,8 January 2001
Victory," Implausible But Enjoyable
","I just couldn't buy the basic premise of this movie. I thought it was a passable piece of entertainment - not stellar, but good enough. But the basic premise lost me. The Nazis were masters of propaganda, and this was a truly no win scenario for them. The story has a soccer team from the German Army taking on a team made up of Allied prisoners who in peacetime had (mostly) been well known soccer players. My mind couldn't grasp how the Germans were going to milk any positive propaganda out of this. If they won - so, they beat a bunch of POWs; if they lost - WHOA! They lost to a bunch of POWS! I just couldn't buy it.But set aside the unbelievable premise and this was an all right movie. The soccer angle aside, what you had was an interesting reflection on the duty of prisoners of war to escape if possible. Hatch (played by Sylvester Stallone) was a repeat escaper, who latched on to the soccer team (first as manager and then, somewhat improbably, as the goalkeeper) because it represented another chance to escape. Colby (Michael Caine) was the Allied team's captain and manager - a former star with West Ham United who now just wants to play soccer rather than escape. What started as a small affair, organized by a German officer (Max von Sydow) ended up as this huge propaganda effort, with the game played in Paris.Yes it was unbelievabe that Hatch would end up as the goalkeeper. Yes it was unbelievable that Hatch would have been allowed on the team after his attempts at escape. Yes it was unbelievable that he would be put back on the team after escaping again. Yes it was unbelievable in so many ways. But it wasn't unenjoyable. Stallone's performance was pretty good, and there was a funny (to me anyway) nod to his work as Rocky Balboa as he stared down the German who was about to take the last second penalty kick. The last scenes, as the crowd stormed the field and seemed to help the prisoners escape was pretty dramatic. And the movie featured Pele - who showed no great acting talent, but offered up his famous scissors kick a couple of times.Sure it was implausible - and that's generous. But very watchable, and for the most part enjoyable. (6/10)",6,0,0,7 February 2015
Selma," An Important Movie About Important Events
","David Oyelowo was brilliant as civil rights leader Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. That's a difficult role to play, because King is such an iconic figure to many, and especially because he is essentially a martyr for the cause, having been assassinated a couple of years after the events depicted in this film. But if Oyelowo was even remotely overwhelmed by playing King, he didn't show it. Instead, he captured King. His voice, his mannerisms, his passion. It was truly impressive - the best part of a movie that was generally very good, but at times a bit slow moving.But more than just featuring a great performance (Oyelowo should have been nominated for an Oscar, I might add) it's an important movie. In fact it's a sobering movie, because it's largely so accurate. It's sobering for me to realize that these events happened in my lifetime. This wasn't the distant past - this was the south of just 50 years ago where racism was a way of life and keeping blacks poor and disenfranchised - through the use of state sanctioned violence if necessary - was accepted political policy. The movie revolves around the struggle for black voting rights in Alabama. In theory, blacks had the right to vote, but in practice various methods were found to prevent them from registering. King and his associates take on the cause and try to organize a march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery demanding voting rights for blacks - the first attempt at the march descending into sickening violence against the marchers by the authorities.In the course of showing the march being organized, there are a lot of points made. The political machinations are revealed and believable. Alabama Governor George Wallace was played by Tim Roth, and President Lyndon Johnson by Tom Wilkinson. Personally, I found Wilkinson difficult to accept as LBJ. To me he just didn't seem right in the part - but the movie makes the point that Johnson had to be pushed to propose the Voting Rights Act of 1965, when he would have preferred to do something less dramatic. The movie also isn't shy about hiding some of the divisions within the leadership of the civil rights movement itself. The movie also notes the prominent place of faith in the civil rights movement.It has a powerful beginning and ending - the beginning portraying the murder of four young black girls in the bombing of a church, and the movie closes with a gripping piece of music. I often don't bother with the closing credits of a movie, but I left them on to hear the song because I found it so moving.There were a few parts of this movie that failed to really capture me, and it did seem a little bit inconsistently paced. But it's an important movie portraying important events - and still quite relevant, given many of the concerns today about voter suppression laws which seem aimed largely at blacks, and recent incidents of police violence toward the African American community.

The Artist," A Brilliant And Imaginative Film
","It is absolutely impossible to watch this film without being astonished by how well made it was by director Michel Hazanavicius. When you think about it, this was a risky project. In the second decade of the 21st century how many movie goers would actually be impressed by a silent movie? And I must admit that for the first few minutes I was tentative as I watched this, wanting to be impressed but holding back on my admiration, almost as if I wanted not to like it for some reason - but then succumbing, and having to admit that it really is a brilliant piece of movie making. And Hazanavicius deserves great credit for that. He took this very old and worn style of movie making and made a very new and fresh style of movie out of it. Once you're hooked - which you are very quickly, if not right away - you're hooked.This is a great story. If you know anything about movie history, you know how true to life it is as well. How many silent actors just couldn't cope with the advent of the talkie? How many careers went down in flames almost literally overnight as the talkies took centre stage? In 'The Artist' it's the fictional George Valentin who's facing this sudden upheaval. Valentin is a huge silent star for Kinograph Pictures, when all of a sudden the studio simply tells him that it's over. Everything they have - all their resources - are now being put into talkies, and George - as big a silent star as he was - just doesn't fit. As arrogant as he is in many ways, you still feel so sorry for him. His life crumbles; his marriage crumbles; he loses everything (except the love of his dog, who stays loyally by his side through everything.) He struggles to keep going. When Kinograph cuts him loose he tries directing and producing his own silent movie. I think the saddest scene in the entire film is the premiere of this effort, as we see an almost empty theatre watching. He WAS a big star - but no one cares about him anymore. The movies have passed him by. It would be the equivalent of people suddenly losing interest - all interest almost overnight - in George Clooney or Brad Pitt. There's a rawness to that simple shot of the almost empty theatre; it truly cuts at the viewer. And you wonder how many silent actors had this (or something similar) happen to them as the 20's suddenly became the 30's - and no one cared about them anymore. French actor Jean Dujardin was wonderful in this role. He silently captured Valentin's pain and bewilderment and sadness as the life he knew totally collapsed around him.And, of course, there was the other side of the coin - represented by Peppy Martin (played by Berenice Bejo, who reminded me very much of a young Joan Collins.) Peppy was a fan of Valentin who managed to give the mega star a peck on the cheek, which photographers captured. That earned her some work as an extra and finally a scene with Valentin in one of his movies. Then - the talkies that destroyed Valentin were perfectly suited to Martin. She rocketed to superstardom even as Valentin collapsed into obscurity. From time to time their paths would cross, each time the different trajectories their lives and careers had taken becoming more noticeable. Bejo was also perfect in the role. She pulls off the hint of arrogance so natural for someone who's just become the hottest ticket in Hollywood, pointing out to reporters (as Valentin - unbeknownst to her listens) that people are tired of silent movie actors and all their 'mugging.' But she doesn't forget Valentin. She falls in love with him and rescues him, finally using her currency as Kinograph's new mega-star to insist on making a movie with him - or else. It can't be a talkie because Valentin doesn't do talkies. But it all leads up to an absolutely breath-taking dance routine between the two near the end of the movie.Brilliant. Just brilliant. The supporting cast were equally strong - from James Cromwell as Valentin's (and later Miller's) chauffeur to John Goodman as the head of Kinograph Pictures to even Uggie as Valentin's loyal little pooch. A great movie. I found it just a little hard to get into at first, but I think that was my fault more than the movie's as I struggled slightly with the whole largely unfamiliar silent medium.

Invictus," A Very Inspiring Story
","Nelson Mandela is one of the very few people I can think of (and certainly the only one living today) to whom I would be willing to apply the adjective 'great.' His personal story of rising from imprisonment under apartheid to becoming the first black President of South Africa is a powerful testimony to perseverance and forgiveness, as instead of using his newly acquired power to take revenge on those who had oppressed he and his people, he chose to use his power to promote reconciliation. The world would be so much better off today if there were more Mandelas! 'Invictus' offers just a small part of that story. Shortly after the advent of majority rule, South Africa hosted the World Cup of rugby. South Africa's own rugby team was (with one exception) all white, and had been hated by the black majority during the apartheid era. Mandela chose to use the team as a way to promote unity in the country. The disunity was shown in many ways - Mandela's own presidential bodyguards (some black and some white) were highly suspicious of each other, and in a match against England before the tournament the black spectators cheered for England. By publicly supporting the team, Mandela brought other blacks onside as well, and brought blacks and whites together as they all rallied around the team. It was really very moving to watch the barriers come crashing down in so many ways.Morgan Freeman was very good as Mandela - as good as anyone could have played the difficult part of a man who is truly a living legend. Matt Damon was excellent as the captain of the Springboks (the name of the South African team.) His family were suspicious of Mandela, and yet once he actually met Mandela, he quickly bought into the desire to unify the country around the symbol of the team. Damon seemed to capture the essence of the character well.I'm not a rugby fan, so the actual scenes of the matches meant little to me (although they were very well shot, and did offer an sort of 'you are there' type of experience.) There was some beautiful scenery shot in the course of the movie and you do feel moved as - so to speak - the walls come tumbling down.",9,0,0,27 June 2010
Mission: Impossible," Typical Tom Cruise Action Movie
","I've never seen the 1960's TV series of the same name on which this film was based, so I find myself comparing it to other action flicks, and especially to other films starring Tom Cruise. I've never found Tom Cruise to be among the finest actors I've seen, but what I generally like about his performances and his movies was present here in great abundance. The movie is fun, fast paced and full of action and energy. At times it can leave you breathless. Those qualities sometimes become its weakness, too, though. It's almost too fast in a few places, leaving your head spinning around a plot that I didn't think was either well developed or well explained and the end result of some of the extreme action is that some parts of the movie can seem quite slow in comparison. Some of the action scenes in the movie (especially the helicopter chasing the train through the Chunnel) was a bit too over the top.The movie centres around Ethan Hunt, a US secret agent who becomes suspected of treason after a mission he's on goes awry and his team is killed. The viewer knows he's innocent - the question is who's the real mole? I found reason to suspect a number of people - perhaps there were too many to suspect, actually. I don't want things spelled out too clearly, because that would take the fun away, but I like to be able to have a clear enough story to be able to make an intelligent guess rather than just a wildcard bet.The performances here I thought were nothing to write home about. Not bad, but nobody really stood out to me as superb, either. It's a fair to middling action movie that's fun to watch - but there are better action movies out there. 6/10",6,0,1,29 August 2008
The Last Samurai," A Great Movie That Borrows A Bit Too Heavily
","After the first half hour or so, I have to admit that I was very disappointed with this movie. It seemed as though we were being treated to a remake of Edward Zwick's earlier (and magnificent) Civil War movie 'Glory.' Several of the scenes seemed lifted almost word for word and action by action from that script. Think about it: the young officer (Algren, played by Tom Cruise) tormented by his memories of past battles (like Shaw in 'Glory'); the training scene in which Algren demands that the inexperienced Japanese soldier shoot under fire (as Shaw did with Jupiter in 'Glory'); the Samurai emerging from the fog to take on the inexperienced Japanese army (as the Confederates did in taking on the 54th Massachussetts in 'Glory'). 'Glory' was a great movie, but I really wasn't looking for it to be refilmed in the context of a Japanese civil war. Fortunately after that first half hour the overt references to Zwick's earlier movie faded away (with the exception of one scene near the end of the movie when Algren hands his journal and papers to an observing journalist before going into battle, just as Shaw did before the Battle of Fort Wagner) and 'The Last Samurai' is then able to take on a life of its own, and it does so very well.There were a number of things I really liked about this movie. It provided an interesting reflection on Samurai culture. (I say reflection rather than study because I have no idea how historically accurate the reflection was.) We see a clear reflection on American history (and particularly on the winning of the west.) Algren was supposedly a veteran of battles against the Sioux, and there are several references to Custer. Obviously, Algren is trying to make amends for helping to wipe out native American culture by trying to preserve traditional Japanese culture. There was also a perhaps inadvertent reflection on the so-called 'Stockholm Syndrome,' in which a captive begins to increasingly identify with his captor, as Algren clearly does after being taken prisoner by the Samurai.This movie features very good performances by Cruise (with whom I am not always enamoured) and also by Ken Watanabe, playing Katsumoto, the head of the Samurai warriors, and there was an excellent closing battle scene (obviously Zwick - as he showed previously in 'Glory' - is an expert at recreating such scenes.) The only thing that detracted from this (aside from the lack of originality in stealing too many scenes from 'Glory') was an ending that was altogether too sappy in a number of ways. I would have ended this on the battlefield, which to me would have been more appropriate. Still, there's no doubt that this is deserving of an 8/10.",8,0,2,11 January 2008
Snowden," Hero Or Traitor?
","I watched this movie with no real stake in it. I'm aware of Edward Snowden and have a little bit of familiarity with what he did, but I don't really have a position on whether he's a hero or a traitor. The perspective of this movie is clear. Directed and co-written by Oliver Stone, it's hardly surprising that the film falls on the 'hero' side of that question. And, to the extent that the movie is an accurate portrayal of events, that's certainly an arguable position to take.The movie presents us with basically ten years of Snowden's life. He begins as a soldier, trying to get into Special Ops, but he just isn't good enough and eventually is discharged because he's not physically up to the job. He ends up working for the CIA (and later the NSA) and during those years we see a gradual evolution in his understanding of his work. He progresses from a man who simply wanted to serve his country and help keep it safe to someone who concluded that the country he was serving wasn't the country he thought it was. One gets the impression that his real disappointment was in Barack Obama, who became president but changed nothing. His disillusionment, caused by his growing realization that a lot of the American intelligence services were actually busy primarily keeping tabs illegally on every day, law-abiding Americans, eventually leads to his decision to become a whistle blower and finally a man without a country - living in Russia, but with no place really to go. He did have the satisfaction, though, of seeing his leaks result in the surveillance program being supposedly cancelled. (Although - who knows?)The movie provided a fascinating (and somewhat frightening) look at the ability of US Intelligence to keep track of its citizens activities (and presumably other countries have the same ability.) It's hard to watch this and not feel just a little bit paranoid, although I've been able to resist the temptation to put a band-aid over my laptop camera lens. And yet, while perhaps frightening, it's also hard not to be grudgingly impressed by what you see. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a fine job as Snowden. I also liked Gordon- Levitt's work in 'The Walk.' He's become a very fine actor since his early days as Tommy on '3rd Rock From The Sun.' The movie has as its background Snowden's meeting with two reporters to whom he gives the classified information that he stole (who are played by Melissa Leo and Zachary Quinto, who both were good but weren't really central in my opinion to the point of the movie, except that they facilitated the information getting out to the public.) There was a lot of reflection on Snowden's relationship with his girlfriend Lindsay, played by Shailene Woodley. Theirs was an up and down relationship - not surprisingly perhaps, since Snowden had to keep so much of his life and work secret even from her. Woodley, who I'm not familiar with, was fine in the role - and quite lovely as well. I was pleasantly surprised to discover in the captions as the movie ended that Lindsay had joined Snowden and now lives with him in Moscow.My biggest criticism of the movie is that it was rather slow moving, and I thought a bit disjointed. There were times when I was having some trouble fitting all the various pieces together. It was an interesting movie, but it wasn't a movie that captivated me or held me spellbound. In the end, while I'm more sympathetic to Snowden, I also understand why the hero or traitor question is still an open one. It's certainly a complicated issue that will probably always polarize people.",7,1,3,6 January 2017
Woman in Gold," Good Blending Of A Contemporary Legal Battle With Reflections On History
","I wasn't at all sure how interesting I would find this movie. It deals with an issue of importance. It's about the fight for restitution - the fight to return to Holocaust families or their descendants works of art that were stolen by the Nazis in Austria and then never returned by future Austrian governments. In particular, it's the story of Maria Altmann (played by Helen Mirren) - an aging woman whose parents perished in the Holocaust and who desperately wants back from a Vienna museum a portrait (dubbed the Woman in Gold) of her late aunt. To her, the painting represents a connection with her past and with her extended family and with happier times before the insanity of Nazism shattered so many lives. To the Austrian government, the painting is a piece of the national culture, and it's extremely valuable. Engaging the services of a young American attorney (played by Ryan Reynolds) the movie shows us the fight for the painting in both US courts and with various Austrian officials and arbitrations.That is an important subject. People should have a right to what's theirs, and surely the Austrian government shouldn't want to keep that which was stolen by the Nazis? But, of course, as the movie alludes to, the Austrian government itself is less than open about the country's Nazi history, and many Austrians just want such claims to be tossed aside. I have to say that while the movie certainly makes you sympathize with Maria's battle, in truth I didn't find the legal battle over the painting to be especially riveting. And yet, even if the primary storyline of the movie didn't especially reel me in, the movie worked for me.What really worked well was the interspersing of Maria's history throughout as flashbacks. We see the family in happy (pre-Nazi) times in Vienna, with Maria loved and cared for by her parents and by her aunt and uncle. We see the beginnings of the Nazi occupation and takeover and the growing anti-semitism of the country. We see Maria's escape (with her husband) from a Gestapo officer as they make it out of the country and to the US, and we see the heart- wrenching good-bye that Maria shared with her parents, as her father made one request of her: remember us. That particular scene came near the end of the movie and it helped put everything else in context. This wasn't about a painting. It was about honouring Maria's past - those she loved and who loved her.This had the potential to be a sombre movie, and yet it didn't become that, primarily thanks to the interplay between Mirren and Reynolds. They worked well together as a team, and there was often a humorous tinge to this very serious subject that made even the dryness (as I perceived it) of the legal battle over ownership of the painting to be easy to watch.Personally, I wouldn't rank this as a masterpiece, but it's a well done movie about a very important subject.

The King," Well Put Together But Full Of Historical Inaccuracies
","As the movie opens, young Prince Hal (Timothée Chalamet) - the first son of King Henry IV of England - has left behind royal life and adopted his infamous 'wayward' life. But soon thereafter his father's illness and eventual death brings him back to the court and ultimately puts him on the throne as King Henry V, immediately plunged into the complicated politics of the 15th century English court, with a desire to set right some of his father's wrongs, to establish the legitimacy of his reign and to achieve some of what his father had been unable to achieve - primarily to successfully claim the throne of France.Basically, the movie is well done technically. The sets and costumes give an authetic 15th century atmosphere, and the climactic Battle of Agincourt, in which the English (led by young Henry, by now King) defeated a much larger French army, is extremely well choreographed and it does accurately depict the use of the English longbow, which was in fact a much superior weapon to the cross bow used by the French, the use of which played a key role in the real Battle of Agincourt.) Having said that, the movie is also riddled with historical inaccuracies that are too numerous to recount here. Rather than being based on the historical record, 'The King' is largely based on the relevant plays of William Shakespeare, which produces one of the greatest (because it was so central to the story) of the historical inaccuracies - the front and centre presence of Sir John Falstaff - who never existed, but was a fictional chartacter created by The Bard. So, if you're looking for a history lesson, you won't find it here except perhaps in very broad brushstrokes. Nor will you find a recounting of Shakespeare. This is more of a mish mash of some of Shakespeare's work, combined with a bit of history and a lot of historical licence.It's a tough slog at times to get through. I found it far too long at almost two and a half hours and there were times when it felt as though I could have skipped lengthy parts of this and not really missed very much of consequence. However the performances were good, and while I think it's a bit over-rated, I certainly wouldn't call this a bad movie, especially for those with an interest in the medieval era.

The Fly," After A Slow Start This Becomes A Very Good Remake
","I wasn't especially taken with this after the first half hour or so. There seemed to be a vaguely comic element involved that wasn't fitting - revolving mostly around the character of scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum.) For those first few minutes the character wasn't working for me. And then, somehow, it came together. Goldblum turned out to be very good and very convincing in the lead role as the scientist who accidentally 'teleports' himself along with a housefly, and finds their genes 'spliced' - after which he begins to slowly mutate into a human- fly hybrid. This, of course, is based on the 1958 movie of the same name - a movie that I wasn't especially blown away by so I went into this wondering why a remake was called for. But this is one of those rare remakes that are substantially better than the original. I particularly liked the hybrid idea. In the original movie we got a rather silly concept of a human with a fly's head and a fly with a human's head. Splicing them together as one creature was a good move, and created an increasing 'creepiness' as Brundle gradually transforms. Genna Davis was pretty good as Veronica, the reporter who wants Brundle's story and then falls in love with him, but it really was Goldblum who made this work.David Cronenberg directed. I've not been an especially big fan of Cronenberg's style over the years - and at times this is very much an Cronenberg-style movie - but I would say that of the Cronenberg movies I've seen, this may well be the strongest. It's a good, suspenseful and at times truly creepy movie. (7/10)",7,0,1,12 April 2011
Groundhog Day," One Of Bill Murray's Best
","The premise is simple, and yet intriguingly complex at the same time: a man is forced to repeat the same day over and over and over again until he learns the lessons he needs to learn and is able to escape from the cycle.The man is Bill Murray, playing Phil Connors - a Pittsburgh weatherman sent to Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania on February 2 to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities in that small town. Phil is not a nice guy. He's self-centred and egotistical and selfish. He considers no one's feelings important but his own, and he hates the annual assignment in Punxsatawney. He hates the work, he hates his co-workers, he hates the place, he hates the festivities and he hates the people, and he can't wait to get out. He treats everything and everyone as obstacles in the way of him getting what he wants. But stranded by a blizzard, Phil wakes up the next day only to discover that it's not the next day. It's still February 2 - still Groundhog Day - and he has to do the same things all over. And the cycle keeps repeating - which is a wonderful analogy for his empty and shallow life.The point of the movie is how repeating the same day gradually changes Phil. At first he sees it as he sees the rest of life - as a chance to manipulate. And so he spends every day learning about people - and particularly about the attractive women in town so that - with him being able to remember and them not - he's able to get whatever he wants by learning their likes and dislikes as a result of perhaps centuries of living the same day (because we're never really told how long the cycle goes on.) Phil develops a particular interest in Rita (Andie McDowell) - his beautiful producer. At first he manipulates her as well, but eventually starts to have feelings for her, and she finally proves to be his escape from the cycle, along with an encounter Phil has with an old homeless man who dies, and whose death on February 2 - which Phil can't prevent no matter how many different ways he tries - seems to touch him very deeply.Murray did a great job in showing Phil's subtle changes in how he reacts to the situation. Cynical and selfish at first, he's in turns confused, manipulatively happy and opportunistic and then suicidally depressed until he finally realizes that he has to learn to make the best of his situation and he actually starts to value the people around him and the lives they lead. Murray partnered well with McDowell, and the movie itself raises the same questions for the viewer as Phil was being forced to live through - what would you do if you could lead the same day over? Would you fix your mistakes and become a better person or would you use the situation to your own advantage?This is very funny at times and at times it's equally very dark - and Murray does well with both. It's a thoughtful and thought-provoking movie that's fun to watch. (8/10)",8,1,3,20 August 2011
National Treasure," Fast, Furious - And Fun
","The story - about a secret treasure whose location is revealed in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration of Independence - is kind of silly, the concept of actually being able to steal the Declaration of Independence stretches credibility, and the basic plot outlining the finding of clue after clue (Ben's father is convinced that there is no treasure - just one clue after another to confuse the British at the time of the Revolution) gets confusing at times. With the Knights Templar and the Freemasons somehow woven into the storyline there's also a hint of a conspiracy theory - although Ben insists that there is no conspiracy theory. Having said all that, this movie is fast paced, a lot of fun and - if one can suspend the disbelief that some of the above points encourage - actually quite suspenseful at times. In other words, it's a pretty good ride! For whatever reason, I sat down to watch this with low expectations and I emerged as a fan - enough of a fan that I'll probably pick up the sequel. Nicholas Cage was very good as Ben Gates, obsessed with finding this treasure ever since his grandfather told him the story many years before. The rest of the cast was, in all honesty, less convincing (and Abigail, played by Diane Kruger, wasn't an entirely credible character, fell in far too quickly with Gates and was obviously there only to provide the requisite romance.) Still, if you like a good family-friendly action/suspense movie with a bit of humour thrown in, you'll probably see this as a winner. 8/10",8,0,1,21 October 2008
The Great Raid," A Rare Movie Look At A Japanese POW Camp
","After the American evacuation of the Philippines following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, thousands of American servicemen were abandoned to the Japanese enemy, finding themselves facing brutal conditions in Japanese POW camps, and feeling forgotten by their country. 'The Great Raid' is the portrayal of a rescue mission to save five hundred of those POWs at the Cabanatuan camp before they're killed by their captors, as the Americans begin to close in during the closing days of the war.As far as I can recall there haven't been very many movies depicting conditions in Japanese POW camps. 'Bridge On The River Kwai' springs to mind, but this is the only other one I think I've come across. It's always hard to judge the accuracy of how the enemy is portrayed in a movie like this. In this case, though, we do know that the Japanese were in fact brutal captors. Surrender was the ultimate dishonour, and prisoners, therefore, were seen as deserving of neither honour nor respect. The conditions portrayed in the camp, therefore, were believable and probably historically accurate.The portrayal of camp conditions is one of the highlights of the movie. The other is the actual raid carried out. It was portrayed in great detail and, again, in a very believable way. The basic problem with this movie, though, is that it repeatedly seems to get bogged down. Frankly, when the movie strays from those two subjects it just isn't that interesting, and all the various sidebars end up making this longer than it needed to be. The character of Margaret Utinski (played by Connie Nielsen) was especially problematic. Utinski was a real person - and a winner of the Medal of Honour - but there are historical questions about her life, and there was certainly no romance involved in her actions, as is suggested throughout the movie. Aside from Nielsen, the cast were fine, but in all honesty no one stood out to me as outstanding. As I've suggested, there are certainly aspects of this movie that make it worthwhile viewing, but it certainly can't be mistaken for a masterpiece. (6/10)",6,7,7,2 December 2013
Rocky," Definitely One Of The Greats
","This is not only one of the best sports movies ever made, it's got to rank as one of the most impressive films ever made. Rocky Balboa must be perhaps the most memorable character Hollywood has ever come up with. Really - is there another character that could compete? Maybe James Bond - except he wasn't a Hollywood creation; he came from novels. The memorable thing about Rocky is that he's everyone - everyone who has ever been down and out, everyone who has ever felt that life didn't give him a fair shot, everyone who has regrets about not having lived their dreams - and who doesn't fit in there somewhere? Rocky Balboa (whom Sylvester Stallone was absolutely born to play) is a bum. There's no other word for it. He's uneducated and crude, he lives in a rundown apartment in a rundown part of Philadelphia, he makes a living by collecting for the local loan shark and sometimes by being a club fighter, and from the opening scenes of the movie - featuring a depiction of one of his club fights - he's a club fighter who's even outclassed by the other club fighters, except that when he gets mad, boy can he punch! And - when he wins, bloodied and bruised, he gets the winner's share, which amounts to all of $40.55, if I remember correctly. But there's another side to Rocky. You see it early in the movie when he returns to his apartment after that club fight and he stares at a picture of himself as a young boy. It's in his eyes - 'What happened to me? What happened to that young boy?' And you keep seeing it. There's a gentle, even playful side to him. He can't bear to break the thumbs of a guy who owes the loan shark money, he looks out for a young girl who's hanging out with a bad crowd, he picks up a drunk passed out on the cold streets outside a bar and carries him inside to warm up, he likes animals (he has pet turtles and a goldfish) and he plays with the animals at the local pet store. And - most important to the movie - there's a sweet sort of innocence to him as he struggles to come up with the words to ask the equally shy Adrian (Talia Shire) - who works at the pet store - for a date. Rocky is a far more complex character than most people think.And then, out of the blue, comes the big break. The Heavyweight Champion of the World - Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) - needs to find a replacement opponent. A huge Bicentennial Fight (the movie was made in 1976) has been promoted and a lot of money spent and the top contender has been injured and can't fight. No other ranked contender is interested - they need more than a few weeks to prepare. So, Creed reasons, we need an angle - we'll give an unknown a shot at the title. And from the multitudes of nobodies who certainly must exist, Rocky Balboa is chosen - not because he's a good fighter or even well known, but because Creed figures he can promote the heck out of his nickname - 'The Italian Stallion.' And the movie leads up to the climactic bout between the two.Two scenes stand out for me (several do, actually, but these two most of all.) The night before the fight, Rocky can't sleep and goes over to the Spectrum, where the fight is to be held. When he returns, he sits on the bed beside Adrian and admits to her that he realizes he can't win - he's not even in Creed's league. But, he realizes, he doesn't have to win. All he has to do is go the distance (15 rounds). No one has ever gone the distance with Creed, he says, and if he does he'll prove to himself that he's not 'just another bum from the neighbourhood.' Then there's the 14th round. After a brutal fight, Creed finally knocks Rocky down. Rocky's own corner men (led by his manager Mickey - played superbly by Burgess Meredith) call out to him to 'stay down.' He's been magnificent; he's got nothing left to prove. Creed figures the fight is finally over and puts his arms up to celebrate his victory, then watches in disbelief as Rocky struggles to his feet and gestures at him to keep going. Rocky makes it all the way. He goes the distance. He loses the decision, but it doesn't matter, because sometimes losing is just as good as winning.What a great movie, and well deserving of its Oscar. There were just a couple of things that gave a bit of an unbelievable edge to it. First, this fight would never be sanctioned as a title bout. It would have been at best an exhibition match, with the title not up for grabs; second, I find it hard to believe that the referee would have let Rocky continue after the knockdown in the 14th round, given the shape he was in at the time. But it's a movie. Suspend disbelief, and just enjoy - and one of the things that you will enjoy the most is the unforgettable 'Rocky' theme music!The 'Rocky' franchise may be getting old and tired. The first two sequels were all right, the next two were awful, and I haven't seen the latest installment ('Rocky Balboa') where a sixty year old Rocky returns to the ring. But even if the franchise is getting old and tired, the first of the movies will always be one of the greats! 9/10",9,0,0,11 March 2008
Don't Breathe," Outlandish But An Effective And Suspenseful Thriller
","Perhaps the best thing about 'Don't Breathe' is the twist that takes place and leaves you wondering who - if anyone - you should be rooting for. For the first half of the movie, this is a pretty standard type of home invasion story. Three teenagers have made a career of sorts breaking into houses. As the story begins they've decided to target a blind man (a helpless blind man!) who they believe has a huge amount of money hidden inside his house. Well, it turns out that the blind man isn't quite as helpless as we might have thought. Things go wrong inside the house pretty fast. You start to expect a sort of cat and mouse thriller as this blind man sets out to get these no good kids. Except ... I don't want to give it away. Suffice to say there are a lot of secrets inside this blind man's house - enough that by the end you don't really know who the good guys are - or even if there is a good guy. It's a good (if outlandish) story, full of twists and turns that keeps you guessing pretty much the entire way through.Director Fede Alvarez did a good job with the setting, using the house - dark, mysterious and foreboding (because what would a blind man need with light anyway) - and its' neighbourhood - one of Detroit's abandoned neighbourhoods, with this blind man being the only one left in about a four square block radius, if I remember correctly. So, whether inside or outside the house, it's pretty isolated. The performances were very good. Stephen Lang was superb as the blind man, and I thought Jane Levy was very good as Rocky - the most sympathetic of the three teens, perhaps because we know the most about her home life, which isn't happy and which she dreams of escaping with her little sister.There's no doubt that the plot is, indeed, outlandish - but the story is exciting and it has a lot of suspense. The ending of the movie clearly sets up a sequel, which has already been announced - which suggests to me that they're going to take the blind man too far. But who knows. Maybe it will work. This film did work - and it worked very well. (8/10)",8,0,0,20 August 2018
The Red Violin," History Through The Eyes Of A Violin
","In many respects this is a rather unusual movie. In fact, you could even say that it isn't a single movie - rather, it's several shorts combined together, with the single connecting thread being the red violin that we watch change hands over the course of a little over 300 years. Built in Italy in 1681, the stories follow the violin through France, Austria, England, Hong Kong, Communist China and finally to an auction house in Montreal, Canada where it's to be sold. The nature of the movie being what it is, some of the stories are stronger than others. The one that really stood out powerfully for me was the depiction of the Cultural Revolution in China.There's a somewhat effective mystery that also holds things together. In 1681, the violin maker's wife went to a fortune teller before she died in childbirth, and the movie makes clear that somehow her fortune is being fulfilled through the violin's travels. I had an advantage coming in, because I knew the basic story and so the explanation of the violin's connection to the woman came as no surprise, but to give credit to the writers, had I not known the story coming in I don't think there's any way I would have figured out the mystery.It's hard to rate the performances here. Again, the nature of the movie worked against being able to identify anyone as the 'star' of the movie. The biggest name was probably Samuel L. Jackson, but he really didn't have a major part until the last half hour or so. I wasn't really keeping track, but if memory serves, the most screen time probably went to Colm Feore, but his role as the auctioneer didn't really stretch him.Overall, I'd characterize this as a movie that really didn't pull me in, but one with a few parts that I thought were very well done. In all honesty, though, I don't think I'd be tempted to watch it again. 5/10",5,3,6,27 September 2008
Shine," Dragged Down By A Weak Second Half
","Somewhat reminiscent (in the basic story, at least) of 'A Beautiful Mind,' 'Shine' offers a take on the story of Australian pianist David Helfgott. I understand that there's debate on the accuracy of the film, both in terms of Helfgott's background and his piano playing skill. Knowing nothing of his background and little of the skills needed to play the piano, I'll choose to avoid the controversy and deal simply with the movie. It started off very strongly. The first half offered a powerful exploration of Helfgott's childhood, at the hands of a domineering father as well as a look at the early indications of both his abilities as a pianist and the first hints of mental illness. It was a little bit slow paced, but interesting nonetheless. Something happened, though, at the point at which David seemed to go truly insane after his Rachmaninoff recital. The movie itself seemed to lose its focus at that point, and it became what seemed to me to be a largely unconnected series of events offering a taste (but not much more) of Helfgott's later life in a rush, which was far less interesting than the first half. Geoffrey Rush was truly excellent as Helfgott, as was Alex Rafalowicz, who played Helfgott as a child. I was also impressed with Armin Mueller-Stahl's performance as Helfgott's father. The character of Gillian (played by Lynn Redgrave, who became Helfgott's wife) seemed to be introduced far too quickly, and I had no idea how they ended up suddenly married. Redgrave did well with the part, but there was little substance to the character. As far as I recall, there was also no mention of the fact that Helfgott had been previously married.The comparatively weaker second half pulled this down a fair bit in my estimation. In the end, I'd say it was OK, but not much more than that. 6/10",6,5,9,22 January 2009
Eyes Wide Shut," It Doesn't Disappoint But It Does Frustrate
","Part of the Stanley Kubrick collection of movies (and, indeed, the last in the Kubrick collection) and starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman (when they were themselves a happily married couple), 'Eyes Wide Shut' doesn't disappoint, but it does frustrate a bit. It's an erotic thriller of sorts, and as such it manages to accomplish most of what you'd expect such a film to do. It IS erotic. It is very much about sex and sexuality and hidden desires and how they affect the relationships we have with those around us. There is a LOT of nudity in this - but somehow, the nudity didn't seem either gratuitous or exploitative. It was natural to this story; indeed, the story wouldn't have worked at all without the nudity. So the nudity involved (which featured a significant amount of Nicole Kidman) doesn't seem intended to titillate (although one can't really complain about a virtual parade of beautiful and often completely naked women) but rather it focuses the story and moves it along. As a thriller, it doesn't really thrill. It's more of a mystery - and it's a pretty good one there as well. There's really no strong sense of where this is going or of what the point of it is, aside from following Dr. Harford (Cruise) on his 24 hours or so of almost (but never quite) debauchery while his wife (Kidman) stays at home sleeping and looking after their daughter. In that sense it does manage to hold your attention very well. You want to know what this is about. What is this seemingly semi-pagan sex club that Harford stumbles upon; who are the people involved in it; are there going to be any repercussions for Harford and his family. In all those ways this is very good and very interesting. But ...As good as it is in almost every way, in the end this movie frustrates because it never really answers anything. The mysteries are all left standing at the end. We never really do find out much about the 'club' or the people in it, except that they're apparently powerful people who don't want to be known. Harford and his wife seem to put things back together in the end, but we don't really know if there are any lasting repercussions from the adventure of the preceding 24 hours. We don't really know. In the end, that left me feeling a little bit cheated. I wanted to know more about what had happened. I understand that the story had been about the struggles in the relationship of Harford and his wife more than about the 'adventure' itself, but most of the movie was tied up with the adventure. Something in the end seemed missing from this.It's a good movie. Good story; good directing; good performances. I have no arguments about any of that. In the end, though, it just left me unsatisfied.

The Descent," Much Better Than I Expected It To Be
","From the description of the movie, I hadn't really expected to get very much out of this. It seemed like a pretty standard horror-type movie, and in some respects it was. A group of women who have some sort of annual 'adventure' trip, go exploring a cave in the Appalachians in North Carolina. Trapped beneath the surface by a cave-in, they encounter what seem to be mutant humanoid type creatures who, to say the least, have quite an appetite for human flesh and blood. For the first little while, innocent things happen suddenly and unexpectedly, and I jumped because I knew there were creatures somewhere, then the creatures begin to appear suddenly and unexpectedly and I didn't jump as much because now I knew they were going to appear suddenly and unexpectedly, and there was a lot of blood and gore. So far, pretty standard horror stuff. But there were a lot of things I liked about this movie that really raised it up.As the movie started, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) and her husband appear ready to have a heart to heart conversation about some marriage difficulties. Instead, they end up in a horrific car crash that kills the husband and daughter. A shocker right off the top. Then, once the women are stuck in the cave, I'm expecting a sort of female version of male-bonding. Instead, there's the exact opposite. The group starts to splinter apart as they deal with their situation. (Thus perhaps a double entendre to the title: the descent into the cave and the descent of the group into an every woman for herself type of mentality.) I found myself guessing from moment to moment what was going to happen, and my guesses were generally wrong. That says two positive things: first, the writers put a lot of thought into this rather than going for the boringly predictable, and, second, this was interesting enough to keep me wanting to guess. The ending of the movie caught me totally off guard. First, there was Sarah's way of dealing with Juno (Natalie Mendoza) which totally shocked me, then there was what seemed to be the totally logical ending to the movie and the only guess I thought I was going to get right (about who survived) only to be taken in by an unexpected final scene, which causes uncertainty about whether the encounter between Sarah and Juno really took place, and which serves as a completely fitting (and completely unexpected) form of closure, as Sarah finally comes to terms with her daughter's death as she awaits what surely seems to be her own inevitable fate (a fate which is mercifully not shown.) A very violent and bloody movie finishes on a very gentle and peaceful (and one could even say spiritual) note.This was really well done. The women fought perhaps a little too well against creatures that had evolved specifically to live in that dark environment and therefore should have had a huge advantage which too often didn't seem to be the case. The only other thing I would question is the addition of three extra women to the group. From the opening scenes of the rafting trip, my impression is that the usual group is of three friends. Why expand it to six in the Appalachians? The three additional women didn't seem to add very much - except a few more victims for the creatures - and a focus on the relationship between the original three might have been a more interesting study of the group dynamic. But that's about all I can find to criticize here. 8/10",8,1,3,21 January 2008
Inside Man," I Didn't Care For It
","Generally speaking I enjoy Denzel Washington's movies, but - while I acknowledge that most people really liked this - 'Inside Man' just didn't hit home with me. It started out with some promise, as a mysterious group of robbers attempt to take over a bank, seizing a number of hostages. Washington plays a detective sent to be the chief police negotiator. The robbers are violent and seem to mean business. Into the mix is added Jodie Foster's character of Madeleine - a strange and largely unexplained character who's doing some sort of dirty work for both the Mayor of New York (where this is set) and for Arthur Case - the chairman of the board of the bank (played by Christopher Plummer) - who clearly has something from his past stored in a safety deposit box at the bank that needs to be kept hidden.With the bank robbery and hostage taking this seemed to be going in the right direction. Somehow, though, the whole subplot around Case's background didn't really interest me, and Foster's character was (for my liking) too ill-defined to be really interesting. Admittedly, by about halfway through this I was completely lost and found that I was enjoying it less and less as it went along. It turns out to be one of the few movies starring Denzel Washington that I really didn't care for. (3/10)",3,0,4,28 January 2012
Hoosiers," Disappointing: That Sums Up The Movie And Hackman's Performance
","I tuned into this movie not because I am a fan of U.S. High School basketball (in fact I only rarely watch NBA games) but rather because I am a fan of Gene Hackman, who usually manages to bring an impressive depth to his performances. In this case, however, I was sorely disappointed. This was not one of the bright shining stars of Hackman's career.In fairness to him, he didn't have a lot to work with. As Norman Dale, the new coach of a small town high school basketball team in Indiana, he wasn't called on to do much acting. Basically his performance consisted of pacing up and down basketball sidelines ranting at the referees. I didn't find him particularly believable in the role to be honest. I also was unimpressed with the requisite romance between Dale and Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). Quite honestly there was absolutely no chemistry between Hackman and Hershey. The romance never captured my attention, and neither did the basketball 'action,' which was altogether too predictable.There were far too many problems with this movie to make it worthwhile. I never did understand the depth of the sheer hatred that so many of the townsfolk had for Dale, almost from before the time he arrived. The character development was poor and the story itself was poorly developed. Too much basketball and not enough human interaction, in my opinion. How many shots of kids shooting baskets do we need to see to get the point that this is a basketball movie? There was no suspense: is it even possible to doubt that Hickory is going to win the big one? I realize that this is based on a true story, but I guess it proves that not every true story should be a movie. Quite frankly, it just wasn't a very interesting movie. Definitely a movie Gene Hackman would like to forget.No better than a 2/10 in my opinion.",2,4,17,19 August 2002
The Da Vinci Code," Decent Movie, But Not Worthy Of The Controversy It Spawned
","Give credit to Dan Brown (author of the novel on which this movie is based) on a number of counts. First, he did good research into the non-canonical gospels (especially, since they were referenced in the film, to those of Philip and Mary Magdalene). Second, he showed his skill as a novelist by weaving a creative tale around the question of why they're non-canonical, combining the presence of secret societies (Opus Dei and the Knights Templar) along with a hardly unique interpretation of Da Vinci's painting 'The Last Supper' to produce a novel which obviously caught the public's attention. Then, he showed his skills as a businessman by selling the novel to Hollywood, which ended up putting out this mildly suspenseful, largely well acted and mostly entertaining action/suspense/conspiracy theory movie.Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon (a professor of Religious Symbology - of which there is no such beast!) and Audrey Tautou as Sophie are both quite good and worth watching. The story revolves around the search for the Holy Grail (but Monty Python this ain't!). In this case, the Holy Grail is Mary Magdalene's tomb, and the conspiracy revolves around the efforts of the Roman Catholic Church to suppress the truth about Jesus being merely human rather than divine - a figure who, according to the movie, was married to Mary Magdalene and had children with her. Thus, there is also the question of who Jesus' descendants in today's world are. It stirred too much controversy in my view. It certainly has an anti-Catholic tone to it, I admit. The Catholic Church is dismissed as oppressive and misogynistic, involved in murder to keep its secret (and therefore its power). Still, the extreme reaction of the Catholic Church (and some fundamentalist Protestant sects) probably gave more credibility to the movie than it deserved. As a Protestant pastor, I found nothing here that would shake my faith, and the movie never quite goes to the extreme of saying that the story was true. As Langdon says, 'what's really important is what you believe.' In other words, whatever your faith is - it's a matter of faith! (And remember - this movie is based on a novel, not a history text book. It's a piece of entertainment!)Personally I thought the movie a bit too long. The ending, revolving around Langdon actually finding Magdalene's tomb, wasn't really necessary (except, I suppose, to be faithful to the novel) and the revelation of Sophie's identity was anti-climactic. I figured it would turn out that way. (Another nod to Brown's obvious acquaintance with the state of contemporary religion is his choice of the name 'Sophie' for the female protagonist - an obvious nod to the 'sophia' movement in modern feminist Christianity.) It's also yet another example of the 'religion is the cause of all the evil in the world' mentality that is so yawningly cliché in today's society. Overall it's pretty good, although not really deserving of the controversy it spawned, which probably lent it more credence than it should have had. (The secular world would say 'if the church is so against it, it must be true.') I'd give it a 6/10",6,2,5,27 October 2008
Titanic," A Superb Epic
","I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. 'It was so great,' she said. 'You really felt like you were on the ship.' 'Nonsense,' I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, 'you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested.' 'Well, maybe,' thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. 'OK,' I thought, 'I'll give it a look see.' I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost 'you are there' type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect 't' I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of 'My Heart Goes On.'Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.9/10",9,513,719,16 November 2002
Rocky III," A Civilized Rocky Meets Mr. T
","A lot of people didn't care very much for this movie, but personally I rather liked it. It isn't without its weaknesses, but I thought overall that it was better than Rocky II, and certainly worth watching, if one likes the 'Rocky' series.Sylvester Stallone plays a much more civilized Rocky Balboa in this picture. Rocky has been champion for three years and has had ten title defences - unfortunately, as we discover from Manager Mickey (again played well by Burgess Meredith), against 'hand-picked opponents.' 'Good fighters,' Mickey insists, but fighters he knew Rocky could beat. 'My job was to keep you winning, and to keep you healthy,' he explained to Rocky by way of justification. But a new, hard, lean and mean fighter ('Clubber Lang,' played perfectly by Mr.T) has appeared as the top contender, and Mickey wants nothing to do with him. Rocky has become soft, and not up to the challenge. He lives in a big mansion, fights wrestlers ('Thunderlips,' played by Hulk Hogan, in what I thought was a very amusing performance) for charity, and even speaks in a more cultured voice. But Rocky accepts the challenge from Clubber, and the movie goes from there.Clubber Lang is a very different opponent for Rocky than Apollo Creed ever was. I just couldn't dislike Creed. I rooted for Rocky, of course, in those fights, but Creed was not unlikable. He was a showman, and even when a nastier side of him appeared in 'Rocky II,' it was understandable. I felt sympathy for him. But Clubber is just thoroughly mean and unlikable. An opponent like Clubber was probably necessary to make this movie worthwhile. Carl Weathers was decent as Apollo Creed, who now accepts the responsibility for getting Rocky ready for Clubber. Aside from that, though, the performances were a bit lacking. Not because of bad acting, but because the movie was very short (just over an hour and a half) and a lot of it was taken up with training shots. Talia Shire was for me an exception to this, though. I thought her performance as Adrian was very good, especially a powerful scene on the beach when she convinces Rocky that he has to do this just for himself, and not for anyone else.There were weaknesses here. The dialogue (never particularly a strong suit in the 'Rocky' franchise) left much to be desired, and a piece of atrocious over-acting by Sylvester Stallone at Mickey's death scene left me laughing rather than crying, but I liked this movie. And, as always, the fight scenes were magnificent.7/10.",7,1,1,27 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Fun Trip Into A Dark And Yet Wonderful Fantasy World
","I really hadn't expected to enjoy this movie, thinking it to be primarily directed toward children, but upon viewing it I discovered it to be a wonderful flight of fancy and fantasy, whisking the viewer into an unimaginable and yet completely believable world of wizards and magic, trolls and goblins.It was a very impressive performance by young Daniel Radcliffe in the title role of Harry Potter, the wizard in training at the Hogwarts School of Magic who is called upon to save the day by saving the magic Philosopher's Stone from the evil Voldemort (Ian Hart.) In fact all three of the young leads were very good (Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint as Ron.) They brought an appropriate zest and enthusiasm to their parts. At the other end of the age extreme, the veteran actor Richard Harris was completely believable as Professor Dumbledore. Then, of course, there was perhaps the most endearing character of all, the gentle giant groundskeeper Hagrid (played by Robbie Coltrane).The movie is a wonderful tale, mixing in an almost 'Star Wars' type fashion the ideas of light and dark; good and evil. While most would think of it as a children's movie, it has moments of great tension and a surprisingly complex plot to go along with the fun parts of the movie that will endear it to the hearts of many. It also has unbelievable makeup and special effects. All in all, wonderful fun to watch.8/10",8,0,0,18 November 2002
The Happening," M. Night Shymalan Disappoints Again
","'The Sixth Sense' established M. Night Shymalan as a director with great potential. The unfortunate thing is that 'The Sixth Sense' was made more than ten years ago. Since then, the quality of Shymalan's work seems to have been in steady decline - a trend that is powerfully in evidence with 'The Happening' - probably the weakest movie Shymalan has been responsible for (at least of those I've seen.)'The Happening' revolves around some sort of plague that begins to afflict the northeastern United States. The plague seems to drive people mad, eventually causing them to commit suicide. Believed at first to be a terrorist attack on New York City, as it spreads it clearly becomes a natural disaster. Shymalan does a reasonably effective job here of creating a mystery. The plague is certainly frightening and there's no real sense of how it can be avoided. There's no sound explanation of its origins given, except that it has something to do with trees and other plants. Mystery aside, though, this is very disappointing. It begins with what I felt was a sense of unreality - I just didn't buy any of it from the start. It ends with a ridiculous account of the time frame - 'the event' says a TV news reporter 'began at 8:33 am and ended at 9:27 am the next day.' What? How can you pinpoint to the exact minute the beginning and ending of a plague!None of the characters portrayed in this were especially well developed, and none were especially interesting in all honesty. The already uninteresting characters were made even less interesting by lifeless performances from leads Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel, who seemed to put little effort into this and showed little passion for their work right from the start. Shymalan's sad downward spiral definitely continues with this one!",2,3,7,1 December 2010
The Untouchables," Taking Down Al Capone
","Chicago in the 1930's. Prohibition. Crime. Corruption. Gangsters. And standing over it all was the biggest gangster of all: Al Capone, ruthless, heartless and vicious. And taking on Al Capone, devoting himself to the task, was Treasury man Elliott Ness and his team, known as 'The Untouchables.' This movie is very loosely based on those historical events, and is also in lineage with an old TV series of the same name. It's no history lesson, but it does give a bit of a taste of the era and - most important for a movie - it's entertaining. It's pretty graphic at times, and at other times it manages to be humorous. From time to time it even brings out an emotional reaction in the viewer.I give credit to the cast. The movie featured strong performances all round. As Ness and Capone, Kevin Costner and Robert de Niro were excellent, and Sean Connery (in an Oscar winning turn) shone as Ness's associate Malone. The atmosphere of the movie was excellent, especially in portraying the extent of the corruption in the city at the time: from police to the judiciary and all the way to the mayor. It was actually pretty sobering in that sense. As well done as it was, my only criticism would be that it seems to only barely scratch the surface of Capone's criminal empire, and his trial seems anti-climactic. Otherwise, it's very well done.

Mystic River," A Very Heavy, Dark Movie
","'Mystic River' begins with the abduction and sexual assault of a young boy, and that sets the stage for the whole movie. No, this is not light, fluffy entertainment. This is a dark, heavy and tragic story about how a horrible event affects 3 (and, ultimately, more) lives. When Dave was abducted, he was playing street hockey with two friends, but it was Dave who was taken. After the portrayal of the assault, the movie picks up years later, when the lives of all three begin to come together again when the daughter of one of the three is murdered. Dave was played by Tim Robbins, who I thought was very convincing as a man tormented by his past. Jimmy, the father of the murdered girl, was also well played by Sean Penn. The character came across as something of a gangster-type, who decides to seek his own revenge against his daughter's killer. The most disappointing performance (perhaps because he was playing the least interesting character) was from Kevin Bacon as Sean, who has become a police detective and is hunting down the murderer.The story unfolds slowly but remains interesting throughout. The suggestion throughout was that Dave was the murderer, but right from the beginning that seemed too easy and obvious to me. That suspicion led to ultimately tragic results at the end of the movie that were at least the equal of the tragic beginning of the movie. Good use was made of locations, which added a realistic feel to the movie throughout. The strange relationship between Sean and his ex-wife, who would repeatedly phone him and then not speak, struck me as a little bit silly and I thought detracted from the story. In the end, I also wasn't sure how I should feel about what was happening. On the one hand, you have to feel sympathy for Jimmy, who has to come to terms with his daughter's murder. On the other hand, you have the sense that this guy needs to face some consequences for what he's done, and there's no indication that he will. So I was left with mixed emotions.Certainly, a good movie - but, as I said, a very heavy movie. 7/10",7,0,0,28 June 2009
Zombieland," Good Zombie Fun
","I was drawn to this by the presence of Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg in the lead roles. They're both good actors and I figured they'd make this worth watching. I wasn't disappointed. This was a fun movie to watch and Harrelson and Eisenberg both did great jobs with their characters.Set in a time when the earth has been over-run with zombies after a plague, Tallahassee and Columbus (Harrelson and Eisenberg - the names of the characters refer to the destination each wants to get to) team up in their efforts to survive. Tallahassee is a tough as nails survivor who's afraid of nothing and who spends much of his time trying to find whatever twinkies might be left after all this time. Columbus is a socially awkward, nerdy loner who nevertheless manages to survive in this zombie-infested world and actually finds love in it as well! They were a pretty good team. They were matched with Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as Wichita and Little Rock (sisters). I'm less familiar with Breslin and Stone, but thought they were also quite good as thieves and manipulators who constantly try to run off with Tallahassee and Columbus's vehicles, but then are constantly brought back together with them. There's a really good cameo in this from Bill Murray as himself, who survives in this 'zombieland' by disguising himself as a zombie in order to fit in - with ultimately tragic results!This isn't your typical zombie movie. To be honest, I wasn't even clear that these were 'real' zombies. Were they really the dead who came back to life, or were they just really, really sick people? It seemed to be the latter. It's also not really frightening (although there are a few of 'jump' moments scattered throughout.) But it's a good, lighthearted take on the whole zombie concept, and it's fun to watch.

It's a Wonderful Life," Every Life Makes A Difference
","For many this is a Christmas classic, watched every year and much beloved. For me, I've never seen it before. Heard of it; seen short clips of it; but never have I sat down and watched it straight through from beginning to end. Having now done that I can understand why it's such a beloved movie to so many people. It isn't necessarily a Christmas/holiday movie. The basic message would work at any time of the year; it just happens to be set (in its climax anyway) on Christmas Eve. And the message it presents is an important one that everyone needs to hear from time to time, in a world where it's so easy to feel discouraged: every person's life counts. Everyone makes a difference. That's the point here, and it's well made. The movie revolves around George Bailey (James Stewart.) George starts out as a kid with big dreams of escaping his hum-drum (to him) home town of Bedfork Park and seeing the world. But it never works out. He ends up running the small savings & loan operation his father started, while his brother and his friends all seem to go on to bigger and better things - becoming heroes; becoming famous; becoming rich. George has a good life. He's married to a woman he loves (Donna Reed) and he has great kids and a lot of friends, but it just isn't what he always wanted. It's not completely satisfying for him. Eventually it all falls apart when the local ruthless banker (Lionel Barrymore) comes up with a way of bringing him down. With everything apparently out of control, George decides to kill himself, only to be rescued by the angel Clarence (Henry Travers) who shows him what Bedford Park would be like if he had never existed - and it's not pretty.The story isn't complicated. It's simple and straightforward. Everybody does a good job in it. Personally, I thought there was perhaps a little too much emphasis on George's life and what brought him to the brink of suicide, and maybe not quite enough emphasis on George being confronted by the consequences of his non-existence. (And, in the alternative timeline, Bert the cop opening fire on George in the street seemed a bit - shall we say - excessive; not to mention dangerous!) Perhaps the opening, with God and the angels talking to each other as stars and other heavenly bodies was a bit too cute, but it's all within the expected standards of 1946. It is a nice movie, and it does have a nice message. Your life does make a difference to a lot of people - probably more than you know, so be satisfied with it and rejoice in what you have. I can easily understand why so many consider it a classic. (8/10)",8,2,3,9 December 2012
Enemy at the Gates," Good Story, But Film Doesn't Capture It
","I have to confess that I had to watch this movie twice before it finally made a positive impression on me. The first time I could only take about half an hour before I turned it off. Somehow the whole thing seemed muddled and confused and it just didn't capture me. I watched it a second time mainly because it was available and I thought I must have missed something. It is better the second time around.Basically, this is the story of the Battle of Stalingrad, told largely through the eyes of two opposing snipers - Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) fighting for the Soviets, and Major Konig (Ed Harris) for the Germans. Vassili becomes a national hero as the sniper who almost single handedly is wiping out the Nazis, and Konig is sent to Stalingrad by the Germans for the sole purpose of taking him out. The two put on excellent performances in their respective roles. Of the supporting cast I must say that the only significant impression left (and it's interesting that it left a significant impression because it was a relatively minor role) was by Bob Hoskins, playing Nikita Kruschev as a political officer in the Soviet Army.The battle scenes are graphic, so be warned if the sight of blood upsets you. The sets are brilliant, and make you feel as if you have indeed been taken into the middle of a war zone. The psychological aspect of the confrontation between Vassili and Konig is well portrayed by the respective actors. So there's a lot of things going for this movie. Having said that, it still left me a bit dry.There just doesn't seem to be enough here to sustain a movie for two plus hours. How long can you really stay excited about watching two snipers play a cat and mouse game? How long can you really maintain your attention level watching two snipers simply watch for each other, waiting for each other to make the first move? The movie descends into that several times, and - I admit - my attention did wander. I'm quite certain this story was probably better as a novel, where the psychological aspect of the confrontation could be played up more significantly.It's a decent enough war movie, though, and even with that fundamental weakness, it's still worthy of a 6/10.",6,0,1,16 July 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Excellent Performances In A Moving Story
","This is an extremely well-done movie. I must admit that when I started to watch it I was lost after the first little while. It didn't seem to make a lot of sense, and it was certainly not what I was expecting from everything I had heard about 'A Beautiful Mind.' But without giving anything away, let me say that even if you have the same reaction, if you stick with this you will find out why the first 45 minutes or so seems so strange. In fact, that first part of the movie is so well done that when you first watch it you're tempted to just dismiss this as a disappointingly bad movie. But don't do that. Stick with it; it's worth it.Russell Crowe's performance as Dr. John Nash - the brilliant Princeton mathematician who struggles his entire life with mental illness - is magnificent, and demonstrates his versatility as an actor. He portrays both Nash's brilliance and his personal angst perfectly, and brings to the screen a man whom we can all feel for. Equally powerful was the performance of Jennifer Connelly as his wife Alicia, whose struggle with Nash's illness is just as valiant as John's is. Connelly brings out the pain of living in this nightmare, but her love - while tested - is also the source of hope for him and eventually helps him to persevere and even triumph.Moving, and at times funny (I loved Nash's line: 'what's the point of being crazy if you can't have any fun with it?') once the story really gets going it has you questioning almost everything that happens - is it real or not? One of the few criticisms I could make would be that Christopher Plummer didn't really seem comfortable in the role of Nash's psychiatrist, Dr. Rosen. At least, that was my sense. That aside, this really is a great piece of work from Director Ron Howard.8/10",8,0,2,11 August 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Neither The Humour Nor The Action Are As Good As I Was Expecting
","Let's start with the positive. I liked the basic storyline. John and Jane are both assassins working for rival criminal organizations of some sort. They meet while on an assignment in Colombia and fall in love and get married, but neither knows what the other does for a living. Unfortunately, when their respective organizations discover that they're now a couple, they order them to kill each other, and when that doesn't happen they join forces to eliminate them both. That sounded creative and intriguing. I also liked both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the title roles. They worked pretty well together and they brought a lot of energy to their roles, as well as doing a good job of portraying the mix of emotions required: bored in their marriage after 'five or six years' (John doesn't seem sure!), desperately trying to kill each other one minute after they find each other out, then desperately in love the next. The opening and closing scenes in the therapists' office (mostly the opening) were also quite humorous. For all those positives, though, there was a lot here that didn't work.The pacing was off. The humour here seemed sporadic and inconsistent. Actually, aside from that opening scene there really wasn't that much that I found funny. This movie would have worked well as a comedy with some action thrown in; instead, it seemed to want to be an action movie with a bit of comedy every now and then. The action itself was restricted largely to the last third or so of the movie, and then consisted mostly of a gigantic shootout. If you like guns blazing I guess it was exciting, but I found it became old pretty quickly. To be blunt, I was expecting something a lot more entertaining.",5,2,4,18 March 2009
The Departed," A Good Cast Working With A Great Story
","Within the city of Boston there's a cat and mouse game going on. Leonardo DiCaprio is Billy Costigan - a Massachussetts State Trooper who's been able to infiltrate an organized crime group led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). At the same time, Costello has managed to get Colin Sullivan (played by Matt Damon) into an influential position in the State Force's Special Investigations Unit. The criminals know that there's a police mole in their midst, and the police know that there's a criminal mole in their midst, but no one knows their identities, and both organizations gear up to discover who's betraying them. To make things more interesting, Sullivan (the mole inside the police department) ends up assigned to the task group trying to find the mole (which is, of course, himself.) It sounds confusing, but it really isn't. The movie's quite straightforward and full of suspense over who's going to get found out first.There are strong supporting performances from Nicholson, Martin Sheen as Queenan, who's in charge of the undercover cops, and Alec Baldwin as Ellerby, who heads up the Special Investigations Unit.There are a couple of weaknesses in the movie. I was unimpressed with Vera Farmiga's performance as Dr. Madden, the police psychiatrist who becomes Costello's live-in girlfriend but who also develops an attachment to Costigan - without knowing what either of them are doing. Farmiga didn't strike me as believable in the role, and the character of Dr. Madden didn't strike me as very professional. I also thought the movie became unnecessarily bloody in the last twenty minutes or so, which detracted (in my opinion)from what had, to that point, been a nifty suspense movie. I must have missed something in the body of the movie, as well, because - without giving anything away - I found myself confused by the last scene, uncertain of the identity of the shooter or the reason for the shooting.In any event, I still thought The Departed was a very entertaining film, and it certainly holds the viewers' attention for its full two and a half hours. 8/10",8,0,2,11 October 2007
Psycho," I Didn't Think It Lived Up To Its Reputation
","'Psycho' has gone down in Hollywood history as one of the greatest of horror movies, and even if you've never seen it (which I hadn't until today) you still feel a certain connection to the movie just on the basis of its reputation. That in itself can be a problem, because you're expecting a lot when you watch it for the first time. Unfortunately, for me at least, this didn't quite live up to its billing. It was a good movie, Alfred Hitchcock did a good job of directing with a number of what are today recognized as typical 'Hitckcock-ian' touches, particularly with some very effective camera work, and basically the cast, headed by Anthony Perkins as motel owner Norman Bates and supported by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam (I would say in that order of importance to the story) did a fine job. Still, I was expecting something more.First, I would call this more of a suspense movie with a touch of slasher movie thrown in than a horror movie, although that's admittedly through a modern lens. There are really only a couple of scenes that were 'horrific' - one being the famous shower scene and one being the revelation of Norman's mother near the end of the movie. Otherwise you get a mystery - with the end surprise being fairly clearly telegraphed to anyone who was paying attention. The suspense starts with Marion (Leigh) stealing a large sum of money from the real estate agency where she works and running off, eventually coming to the Bates Motel to spend the night. Since the murder in the shower is the classic scene of the movie, you don't expect it to come as early as it does, and you don't expect that so much of the movie is going to revolve around Lila (Miles) and Sam (Gavin) as they search for Marion. Somehow, I expected to see more of Janet Leigh. Still, there is good suspense even if the surprise about Norman's mother is pretty clear from even a mile away.What knocked this down a bit for me, though, wasn't the obvious solution to the mystery. It was the seeming need to offer a very in depth psychological explanation near the end of what Norman was all about. Maybe there was a sense that movie-goers in 1960 would need such an explanation. I found what was virtually a closing soliloquy (and a very long one) by Simon Oakland playing a psychiatrist who's called in to examine Norman to be tedious in the extreme, and largely unnecessary; filled with psycho-babble. Norman could have been explained - if an explanation was felt necessary - much more succinctly.One can't diss this movie. There's really very little wrong with it, except that its reputation makes it very hard for it to live up to when you watch it. Undoubtedly, when watched with late 20th-21st century eyes (well conditioned to the point of being almost oblivious to slasher-type violence) it comes across as a bit dull, frankly. Equally undoubtedly, it didn't come across that way to audiences in 1960. Still, I found it to be a little bit of a letdown compared to what I was expecting of it. (6/10)",6,26,48,1 June 2011
The Witch," This Would Have Been A Better Horror Movie Without The Supernatural Angle
","At first, I thought this was going to be a kind of a rehash of M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Village.' It does sound very similar: a group of people living at the edge of a forest in primitive conditions start to believe that there's something in the woods out to get them. In this case, they believe there's a witch, or even the devil. But, although this has more of a supernatural element than Shyamalan's movie, in some respects it also has a more authentic feeling.This movie really is set in the 17th century. An apparently strict Puritan family, recently arrived at a plantation colony in the New World from England, is banished from the colony because of their religious beliefs. They take up residence in a clearing, with only themselves for company and without the protection of the colony, and with the dark and mysterious forest right beside them, and tragedies start to befall them almost immediately - beginning with the death of the infant son. The family seems divided into various alliances, for lack of a better word: mother and father, older brother and sister, and younger brother and sister. All of them are impacted by the baby's death in a variety of ways, but it's the eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) who becomes the target. She had been caring for the baby when it disappeared. Gradually, as things continue to spiral downhill for the family, Thomasin is suspected of having made a deal with the devil; of being a witch - with results that are ultimately tragic.There is an authentic feel to this. There were fears of witches in the early-mid 17th century, and especially in New England. There were isolated families, in a strange new land, not knowing for sure what lurked in the forests that weren't very far away. Many were hyper-religious. They were inclined to see Satan at work when hardship befell them. They did turn on each other - many of the 'witch' accusations that were made in the era were started by children making up stories that got out of hand because the adults took them seriously. So I actually could buy into this story. I actually could feel sympathy for poor Thomasin as the accusations against her from her own family spiralled out of control. And the performances in this from everyone really were very good. In addition to the sympathy I felt for Thomasin, I was intrigued by the character of William, the father (played by Ralph Ineson.) Yes, he was a strict and hyper-religious Puritan, obsessed with sin and fearful (or at least uncertain about) his eternal fate. But there was also a strangely compassionate nature about William. He did love his family - often very tenderly, kind of turning the traditional stereotype of the strict Puritan father on its head. It was a very good performance. I thought that director Robert Eggers also did a very good job. The movie was filmed in a very isolated location in northern Ontario, and Eggers used the location to great advantage, right down to using only natural lighting, which added to the atmosphere of the movie. He also insisted on using English actors, supposedly so that the accents would be authentic - notwithstanding the fact that the English of the early 17th century probably had a different sound than a modern English accent.And yet, ultimately this disappointed me. The story does, in fact, go for a supernatural ending, as Thomasin, who emerges as the last survivor of the family after killing her own mother while her mother was trying to kill her, does in fact make a deal with the devil (who's represented in the movie by a black goat the family has named Black Phillip.) Ultimately, she ends up joining a coven of witches deep in the forest, with the last scene showing all of them levitating. Perhaps this may seem strange, but I thought that last scene weakened the worth of this as a horror movie. For me, the actions and thoughts of real human beings are far more chilling than supernatural silliness, and the horror of this movie was really the slow buildup of paranoia as we watched the family turn on each other, blaming each other for things that could well have just been natural tragedies. No devil or witches needed, in other words. The ending came across as just silly to me, and detracted from rather than summing up everything that had come before.But that last scene aside, I can't deny that I enjoyed this movie. It was a reasonable look (the ending notwithstanding) at something that could very well have happened in that era and in that context. (6/10)",6,2,3,22 October 2018
Rosemary's Baby," Not The Classic 'Horror' Movie You Might Expect - More Of A Psychological Mystery
","This movie is a classic, and 50 years old, and yet strangely enough I had never watched it until now. And, to be honest, it wasn't really what I was expecting it to be. I had the impression that 'Rosemary's Baby' was more of a straight horror/thriller type of movie. Instead what I found was more of a suspense/mystery type of story. I didn't find there to be anything particularly frightening in it. It was more mysterious, and for me the question hanging over the whole story was whether any of what Rosemary came to believe was real or if it was just a figment of her imagination. I'll give credit to Roman Polanski, who both directed this and wrote the screenplay - there are plenty of scenes and events in this movie that add to that uncertainty. Things happened or would be said that maybe at first seemed innocent, but as they added up I could see how they began to appear suspicious to Rosemary. But there's also enough going on that causes you to think - 'No - this is just Rosemary's imagination going wild.' So, although I have to confess that at first I was struggling with this just a bit (probably because it was so unlike what I was expecting) after a while I became quite fixed on the story. Once you're into it (even if you have to struggle a bit with the beginning) you have to see it through to the end. And I will say this about the ending (which I won't give away) - I don't think the resolution was as clear as some make it out to be. I was still left thinking that what was happening could be real - or maybe was still in Rosemary's mind. If I could hazard a guess I'd say that the intent was that what Rosemary believed turned out to be true, but it just wasn't crystal clear to me.I had mixed reactions to the performances in this. No one really came across to me as outstanding - this in spite of the fact that Ruth Gordon won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Minnie Castevet - Rosemary and Guy's annoying neighbour. I truly did find the character annoying - which perhaps does say that Gordon pulled off the part perfectly, but my reaction to the character perhaps clouded my appreciation of Gordon's performance. I would say that if you wanted to make a movie that in some way features Satan, you could do worse than simply have a young couple move in to a new place who then have to put up with Minnie and Roman as their neighbours. 'Neighbours From Hell' you could call it, even without a supernatural angle! As for Mia Farrow as Rosemary - she grew on me over the course of the picture. At first she seemed a bit wooden for lack of a better word, but I thought she did a good job of portraying Rosemary's 'evolution' as she begins to suspect that something evil was going on.This was OK. Once I adjusted my expectations of it - after realizing that it wasn't going to be the traditional horror movie I was expecting - it managed to draw me in. I would say that I think it's perhaps a little bit over-rated, and if you are looking for a traditional horror/thriller type of movie, this is going to be a disappointment. It doesn't have many traditional frights involved with it and it's a little bit slow paced at times. It's a psychological thriller at best; more akin to a mystery than anything. As long as you keep that in mind, it's enjoyable enough. But don't expect to be scared out of your wits, or even to jump or be particularly startled by anything. (7/10)",7,3,4,29 September 2018
Zero Dark Thirty," Finding bin Laden
","Here's the thing. You wait for 2 hours before you get to the only part that 90% of people are really interested in - the night-time mission by American commandos that ended up with Osama bin Laden being killed. Really, isn't that what everyone's interested in? But for two hours, basically what we got was a not always engrossing account of the search for Osama bin Laden, spread over 10 years, so that at times the continuity seemed lacking and I was personally having trouble connecting all the dots - and so I guess I have some sympathy for the difficulties U.S. authorities had in finding the guy. It really, though, isn't that interesting to watch a meeting of CIA officials discuss (at length) the probability of bin Laden being in the house they finally identified.The movie started out strongly, by using recordings (somewhat controversially from what I understand) of phone calls made from inside the Twin Towers of people calling their families while waiting in vain to be rescued after the planes had hit. It may have been controversial, but it was effective - especially because we simply heard the voices on the phone, with just a black background. No one needs to see the planes crash; we know all too well what that looks like. So that was a good decision by director Kathryn Bigelow. It led into a very graphic and realistic depiction of American torture (I mean - interrogation) techniques on those rounded up that was quite unsettling and it introduced us to Dan (Jason Clarke), who was in charge of the interrogations, and Maya (Jessica Chastain), who had just been assigned to assist him. Chastain was good in the role, and Maya was an interesting character - uncomfortable with what was going on at first, but gradually getting more and more at ease with her role, and developing an obsession with locating and killing bin Laden. It's Maya that the movie revolves around, so a good performance from Chastain was key - and she pulled it off!And yet, beyond that opening and before the mission to take bin Laden out, I still found this movie to be rather hard going; difficult to follow and not all that interesting. I would say this is much over- rated, but all things considered it was probably a movie that had to be made - or at least one that was inevitably going to be made. (5/10)",5,0,4,13 May 2013
Steve Jobs," It Seems Pretty One Dimensional
","So, Steve Jobs is an ass. That's clearly well established in this movie called - somewhat unoriginally, but with precise definition, 'Steve Jobs.' I don't know if it's ever been proven to be true or not, but anecdotally at least, brilliant people are often socially inept at best, and do't do well with relationships. Jobs apparently managed to alienate almost everyone in his life - from his friends (most importantly Steve Wozniak, played by Seth Rogen) to his lover Chrisass Brennan (Katherine Waterston) to the daughter he spent years denying (played by different actresses at various ages) to pretty much anyone who ever worked for him or with him at Apple Computers. He wasn't a particularly nice guy. We spent two hours learning that - although there are quite a few people (including John Sculley, who became Apple CEO and is portrayed by Jeff Daniels) who argue that the portrayal of Jobs in the movie is unfair.My basic complaint with the movie is that Jobs did, indeed, come across as extremely one dimensional. It felt as if I was watching a caricature of the man rather than a serious biography. Michael Fassbender played him - and did well enough - but I didn't come away from the movie feeling as if I knew much more about Jobs than I did coming into it and, except possibly for Lisa as she grows up with a father who refuses to acknowledge that he is her father, I really didn't much care for anyone or about anything in the movie. There's some interesting material I guess about the growth of Apple and Jobs' other ventures leading up to his return to Apple and the ultimate reconciliation between Jobs and Lisa eventually gives you a bit of a heartwarming moment. But I really found this to be on the whole rather passionless and cold. (4/10)",4,1,1,23 June 2018
War of the Worlds," A Pretty Decent Update of the Story
","It's been a long while since I either watched the original movie by the same name or read HG Wells' novel, on which both movies are based, but my memory tells me that Steven Spielberg did a pretty decent job of updating the story for a modern audience, while at the same time keeping the essential elements of Wells' story intact. The updates are necessary to make the movie relevant to the modern era. The basic change is that Wells story begins with radio reports of explosions being observed on Mars. This movie features television reports of strange, electromagnetic weather disturbances - a necessary change since (a) radio is no longer the medium through which we get news, and (b) we now know too much about Mars for the explosions to be believable. In another bow to the modern context, there are also some shades of 9/11. The kids think the alien attack at first is a terrorist act, and watching the dazed people walking by posters of the missing brought back memories of that terrible day.Within the movie itself, there was sustained action right from the beginning, a pretty good flow to the story and generally good performances. Tom Cruise was good as Ray Ferrier, a divorced father who has to protect his children once the aliens begin their attack. I say Cruise was 'good' only because that's my general reaction to his work. He always seems to handle his parts well, but there's just some intangible quality about him that prevents me from going any better than 'good.' In this movie, frankly speaking, his performance is not as good as Dakota Fanning's was as Ray's daughter Rachel. She nailed the part, I thought - showing exactly what I think would be the quickly rising level of terror a young child in such circumstances would experience. She is completely believable. I must say that I never really connected with the character of Robbie - Rachel's older brother, played by Justin Chatwin. I had trouble figuring out exactly where his character was coming from.After so much action, the end of the movie is a bit anti-climactic, but so is Wells' story (and deliberately so.) The point of the rather sudden and understated ending is the irony involved in it - for all our military and technical prowess, it turns out to be something that we usually try to eradicate that saves us. On the subject of military prowess, one thing I found passing strange is that in putting this into a 21st century context, Spielberg didn't portray the military using nuclear weapons against the alien invaders which to me, given the desperate circumstances, would have seemed reasonable.All in all, though, this is a very well done movie and well worth watching. 8/10",8,3,6,19 January 2008
Mudbound," After A Tedious First Hour This Movie Finally Get Going
","I have to admit that 'Mudbound' almost lost me during its first hour. The story sounded good - an account of two farm families (one black, the Jacksons; one white, the McAllans) dealing with racism and various other challenges during and immediately after World War II. The McAllans owned the farm and the Jacksons were sharecroppers. But to be blunt that first hour or so was pretty dull. There didn't seem to be a great deal of tension between the two families. Yes, the Jacksons wanted off the farm - and the reality of the sharecropper system (that basically the sharecropper could never earn enough to pay off their debt so that they could never leave) was pointed out. But what we basically saw was the everyday life of the two families. There wasn't really any drama involved with it. The movie seemed to jump back and forth. Eventually, Japan attacks Pearl Harbor, and Ronsel Jackson and Jaime McAllan join up. Ronsel becomes a tank commander and Jaime a bomber pilot. So in addition to various scenes from the families' home life, we sometimes cut to war scenes. But none of it seemed well connected; the movie didn't seem to be going in any particular direction. It portrayed everyday life - at peace and at war - and everyday life just isn't really that exciting, I'm sad to say. It was rather tedious.The movie does take a sudden turn for the better in the second half though. Ronsel and Jaime return home - and they're changed. The shared experience of war (even though they weren't together in Europe) has broken down a lot of barriers, and they become friends. But Ronsel - having experienced a more racially friendly atmosphere in Europe - has trouble adjusting to the racial realities of the American south, and Jaime just has trouble getting his feet back on to the ground, so to speak. He's traumatized by some of his war experiences, begins drinking - and over it all is his father, who is a completely unpleasant character; a racist who demeans Jaime's war experience. As Ronsel and Jaime become closer you know there's trouble coming, and eventually it arrives, and a movie that had been muddled and tedious all of a sudden becomes focused and riveting.Ronsel is involved in a racist confrontation with Jaime's father almost immediately upon returning home. He might be returning home in uniform as a sergeant after serving his country, but in the south he's still a - well, insert the 'n' word, which - be aware - is liberally (but appropriately given the historical setting) used in this movie. Everything leads to a very brutal scene involving the KKK (and an ultimate confrontation between Jaime and his father) but without giving much away let's just say that the KKK scene could have let the movie end on a very sombre note, but instead the movie ends on an incredibly beautiful and hopeful note. 'Mudbound' almost seems to be two completely different movies - one very good; the other - well, not so much. Throw them together and I have to give this a 5/10.",5,0,5,16 December 2017
All Quiet on the Western Front," Good Depiction Of The Insanity Of War
","I'm not in particular a fan of movies from the 1930's, finding them generally characterized by over-acting (undoubtedly because the actors were still adjusting from the over-dramatization required in the silent era) but I have always wanted to see this Academy Award winning best picture from 1930, and finally got the chance. I was impressed.It has some of the problems I associate with movies of that era, but was still an enjoyable movie to watch. Lew Ayres was excellent as Paul, a young recruit into the German Army during World War I, who becomes more and more disillusioned as the War goes on. His speech to the class in his old school on a visit during leave is an eloquent homily on the subject of war's horror.Interesting (and I daresay courageous in some ways) that this film was shot from the German perspective - and it would be interesting, if impossible, to know whether a film shot from the British perspective would have characterized the war as so pointless. Surprisingly graphic for a movie made in 1930, it's well worth watching if the opportunity comes up.I rated this as a 7/10.",7,0,6,21 March 2002
Love Actually," A Tremendously Pleasant And Enjoyable Movie About Love
","There really aren't a lot of movies about love. There are a lot of romances, but the focus is always on the star-crossed lovers. There are star-crossed lovers in this, but the focus here is less on the characters than it is simply on the power of love as it sometimes appears in unexpected places, and as it sometimes rekindles itself after lying dormant. Sometimes we're recovering from love, sometimes love is from afar and unrequited; sometimes it's just a true and sincere friendship. But it's there. As Hugh Grant says in the opening narration: 'love, actually, is all around us.'I have to confess that I'm generally not a fan of these movies that feature separate story lines that eventually intertwine. I like my movies to have a little more focus, and these movies often seem blurry instead, as you wait (often impatiently) for what you know is the inevitable moment when the various stories will intersect, and everything will be revealed. This movie, however, I enjoyed. There were, in fact, several story lines: an old rocker trying to make a comeback; a recent widower dealing with grief and his young stepson who's head over heels for a classmate; the newly elected and single British Prime Minister who's smitten with a member of the household staff; two porn actors who fall for each other on the set; a recent divorcée who falls for his maid with whom he can't even communicate with because she speaks Portuguese; a newly married couple - and the man who secretly adores the new bride; an older man being pursued by a co-worker who wonders whether to pursue her or stick with his marriage. There might have been others. Usually I would say that's way too much to include, but somehow it all worked here; the stories blended together well and complemented each other. It's a very diverse group of people, all connected by being essentially from the same town. No one relationship really dominated in the story, although the three that really stood out for me were Hugh Grant's role as the Prime Minister (the slightly confused by love character being perfect for him), Liam Neeson as the recent widower dealing with grief and helping his stepson with love and Bill Nighy as rocker Billy Mack, who adds the most comedy to the movie as he releases a Christmas album that he knows is terrible - which he tells everyone, much to the chagrin of his manager. Other lovers in this included Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney and Alan Rickman. There are also small (and non- romantic) parts for Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Atkinson.The characters are basically all likable and pleasant, and you really find yourself hoping that love works out for all of them. It's not really a tug at your heartstrings type of movie, and while it's about love it's not what I would call a 'chick flick' - there are too many situations faced by the respective male characters that I could relate to for it to be that. I suppose it's a bit too sappy at times, but that's in keeping with the subject matter. It's a pleasant movie - and at times it's very funny as we watch the various relationships work themselves out.

12 Years a Slave," I Found This Surprisingly Lacking In Passion - But Maybe That Was The Point
","'12 Years A Slave' won the Oscar for Best Picture, and has been perhaps the most talked about movie of the year. It also deals with a subject matter that's long been of interest to me. So, perhaps my expectations were for something different. But the thing that really stood out for me as I watched this was that for the most part it was surprisingly lacking in anything that could be called passion. I won't deny that there were moments of great passion - and that in an overall sense the movie certainly tugs at your heart as you consider Solomon's plight, and the nightmare into which he was suddenly transported, but there was also just an overwhelming dryness to it for lack of a better word. And then it occurred to me - that could have been the point of the picture.This is the story of Solomon Northup (a true story, told by Solomon Northup in a book he published about his experiences in the 1850's) - a free black man from New York State kidnapped and sold into slavery in the antebellum south. That was not at all a rare occurrence. Being a free black in the era before the Civil War - even in a northern state - carried with it inherent risks. Solomon was a happy man, comfortable and with a family. His life in New York came across as perhaps too idyllic, as if there was no racism in New York, which was certainly not the case. But that also might be a deliberate and exaggerated contrast. Solomon's life in New York must have been a paradise, compared to the horror he was about to be confronted with - a horror that seemed to have no escape. You can feel for the character and his plight, and perhaps that explains the relatively passionless nature of the movie. To survive, Solomon probably did have to shut off his feelings for the most part. He had to numb himself to reality. Perhaps that's the point - one made early in the movie, after his sale into slavery, when he lashes out at Eliza (sold with him) - who can't stop wailing over the children she had been forced to leave behind. She lashes back at him for showing no emotion about his wife and two children. It occurred to me afterward that that one scene may have explained the entire feel of the movie - for Solomon (and for many, both white and black) slavery was dehumanizing (obviously) but it also numbed everyone who was a part of the hideous institution, allowing everyone (both whites who treated blacks like cattle, and blacks who were treated that way) to endure the south's 'peculiar institution.' So maybe the overall feel of the movie fit the story well, and made a point about both slavery and its effects on humanity. Blacks could be slaves but still act with great dignity; whites - simply because they were slaveholders - lacked that dignity; even the kindest slaveholder - such as Ford, Solomon's first 'master' - was still a slaveholder, participating in an inhuman institution. That's clearly too much of a generalization about both whites and blacks, but even if painted with a broad canvass, the point comes across.There were moments of high drama. In many ways the central scene of the movie is the whipping of Patsie. Patsie had become close to Solomon. She was also the special 'love' (in the very sick sense that only slavery could breed) interest of Master Epps, and as a result the object of jealousy and cruelty from his wife. It all comes together in one scene that is raw with emotion. After Patsie gets in trouble, she's stripped and tied to a tree to be whipped. At first Epps can't do it, in spite of the encouragement of his wife. He hands the whip to Solomon and orders him to flog Patsie. Solomon tries to go 'light' but is finally ordered to whip her hard or other blacks will be punished. Solomon has no choice, but still Epps eventually takes over the job himself, leaving Patsie brutalized and bleeding, with her back torn apart, lying down, being tended to by female slaves while Solomon looks on in horror at what he'd been forced to participate in. That was a powerful scene that brought home the evils of slavery - in much the same way, for example, that the whipping of Kunta Kinte to force him to say that his name was 'Toby' was for me the central part of the TV mini-series 'Roots.'Solomon's eventual release is a very dignified portrayal, as he's finally rescued by northern friends who find him and force the law to intervene and have him freed. The scene, I thought, was deliberately underplayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, who played Solomon. The emotion revolves around two hugs - one for the white man who finally came to get him, and one for Patsie - who he leaves behind to face this brutal life alone (because what choice does he have.) Otherwise, Solomon keeps a stiff upper lip, so to speak, and even his eventual reunion with his family is a dignified one, as he apologizes for his appearance, explaining to them that he's been through a difficult time for the last few years.It is perhaps a surprisingly passionless movie - but once you think about it, that makes a point about the institution of slavery itself. As I said, it numbs those who participate in it - either as slaves or as slaveholders. The slaves perhaps have their humanity raised up as they endure what must be the unendurable, the slaveholders have their humanity stripped away simply by their attempt to dehumanize other human beings. '12 Years A Slave' doesn't make for especially exciting viewing, but it is thought-provoking and provides a worthwhile reflection on the institution of slavery and its effects on everyone involved.",7,1,4,7 March 2014
30 Days of Night," A Superb Vampire Movie
","Right from the very beginning, this movie sets a gloomy and foreboding tone. A lone man appears wandering through the Arctic wilderness with a mysterious ship off the coast in the background. Then, the setting is established. This is Barrow, Alaska - the northernmost town in the United States, and a 30 day night is about to fall as the sun disappears below the horizon. The mysterious man turns out to be an advance scout of a sort for a truly frightening gang of very bloodthirsty vampires, who have decided to use the completely dark and completely isolated town as a feeding station. Josh Hartnett did a good job as the local sheriff who at first can't figure out what's happening, but then when he does has to try to find a way to help a small group of people survive this nightmare for 30 days without being caught. This is one of the absolute best horror movies I've seen in a long time. The setting is perfect and is an original twist on the vampire legend, the cast does a fantastic job of presenting the fear and sense of hopelessness the townspeople felt in the situation, and those who played the vampires did so perfectly and were totally convincing. These vampires were a bit different from what we're used to. There was no sense of semi-romance or quasi-sexuality that we've often see portrayed with vampires, from the time of Bela Lugosi on. These vampires just want blood - and lots of it, and they're on a killing spree to get it. The ultimate solution that Sheriff Eben Oleson came up with took me totally by surprise. I hadn't thought of it at all even though I, along with the townsfolk, was trying to figure out how to escape this madness all the way through. The movie is very gory, and definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you're a fan of horror movies (and especially vampire movies) this is most definitely a must-see movie. The town's isolation is used to good effect, although it's also the only niggling plot point. When the vampires arrive, one of the first things they do to ensure that Barrow will remain isolated is cut all the phone lines. That makes sense, but it also creates a problem. Surely people inside Barrow can phone out, and people outside Barrow can phone in. Surely someone somewhere in the world would have noticed long before 30 days were up that they can't phone anyone in Barrow? Surely this would have been reported? I know it's dark, but surely somehow the phone company would have managed to get someone up there to investigate? I mean, in the setting, surely phone service (or at least ham radio service) would be essential for medical evacuations, etc. And yet this goes on for 30 days with no one caring that there's no contact at all? That stretches credibility a bit. Still, in my opinion, by the standards of the genre and on the basis of its originality and atmosphere, this deserves a 9/10!",9,2,4,25 October 2009
There Will Be Blood," A Rather Excruciating Two And A Half Hours
","I think the last significant movie I saw that featured Daniel Day-Lewis in a significant role was 'Gangs of New York.' I was reminded of that movie somewhat. My reaction to 'Gangs' was that it was dreadfully dull, although it did have a smattering of action here and there and at least I could see by the end that there was a point to the whole thing. Its high rating notwithstanding, I have to pin 'There Will Be Blood' with the same dreadfully dull tag. The difference between this and 'Gangs' is that there was precious little action to be found here, long stretches of nothingness (about ten minutes passes by at the start of the movie with no dialogue at all) and in the end I really couldn't see what the point of this was. Some parts of this movie are well done. The portrayal of the Old West was totally believable, the look at early oil drilling was interesting, the performances from Day-Lewis as silver miner turned oilman Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano as the charismatic preacher Eli Sunday were good and the final confrontation between Plainview and his 'son' (Russell Harvard) was very emotional. Overall, though, to me the story didn't seem to flow all that well. It just completely failed to capture my attention, and trying to keep focused on a movie that is just plain uninteresting for two and a half hours is excruciating. For whatever reason I also found the musical score by Jonny Greenwood to be at times inappropriate in that it often just didn't seem to fit the mood of what I was seeing on the screen. Clearly I'm in the minority on this, but I just didn't find this to be a good movie at all, and I frankly can't go any higher than a 2/10 for it.",2,10,19,22 November 2008
Ice Age," Exceptionally Well Done
","Marvellous animation, a good story and fun characters all add up to make 'Ice Age' one of the better 'kids' movies I've seen. The story - set during the Ice Age - revolves around a giant sloth named Sid who stumbles across a human baby, and decides that the baby should be returned to its family. He enlists the reluctant help of Manfred the Woolly Mammoth, and the duo then first do battle with Diego the Sabre-Toothed Cat, who wants to capture the baby, and then, through a series of adventures, manage to turn Diego into a somewhat surprising and surprised ally.Sid is clearly the highlight of the movie. He provides most of the action and most of the fun - a giant sloth who just can't keep still or keep quiet. And yet, for all the humour Sid injects, I appreciated that there were some serious plot elements in the movie as well. The trio stumble upon some cave paintings as they seek out the baby's human family, and a painting of a mammoth family obviously makes Manfred remember his own family, who were apparently hunted down and killed by humans. This also helps to explain Manfred's rather gruff exterior, and penchant for aloofness. Diego's apparent death scene near the end of the movie also injects a dramatic feel, although, on that note, I question the decision to bring Diego back at the end of the movie. His 'death' was a poignant moment, and made the point forcefully of what we should be willing to sacrifice for our friends. Since Disney killed off Bambi's mom, it seems that animated children's stories have wanted to avoid the reality of death. Having said that, the combination of the three (or four, if you count the human baby) points out that families come in many different shapes - 'it's what herds do' is the repeated mantra as Sid, Manfred and Diego (as unlikely a herd as you could imagine) find themselves coming to each other's rescue over and over again as the story progresses.There's some great satirical material here: as the trio trudge southward to escape the ice, Sid reflects wistfully that some global warming would be great, and I appreciated the irony of the fact (as was pointed out by one of the characters) that, in this movie, animals could talk and humans couldn't! The portrayal of the dodo birds was also quite hilarious.All in all, this is an extremely well done family movie. 8/10",8,1,1,14 March 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," Superb Performance By Gregory Peck; Superb Directing By Robert Mulligan
","In my experience, this may be the best adaptation of a novel that Hollywood has ever produced, the story having been taken from the novel of the same name by Harper Lee. It's a story about racism in the Depression-era South. It's a coming of age story for young Scout and Jem, who watch their father Atticus doggedly defend a black man accused of beating and raping a young white woman. It features magnificent performances from pretty much the entire cast. Young Mary Badham was actually nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Scout - but then, perhaps surprisingly, she went on to do very little acting. And what can one say about Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. This may well have been his best performance; when I think of Gregory Peck it's certainly Atticus Finch who comes into my mind. There's an incredible mix of well known names in the supporting cast: Brock Peters, William Windom, Paul Fix and even a very young Robert Duvall. And there really isn't a weak performance among them. Most of the attention around 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is usually focused on the performances, and especially Peck, but I want to pay special tribute to the directing.Director Robert Mulligan did a superb job as well, and while he went on to direct a number of other movies, this surely was his finest job. There's a very good pace to this movie. It starts out slowly, painting an almost idyllic picture of life in this small town in the South, focusing on Scout and Jem and their friend Dill. It's summer, school is out and they're just kids having fun. It's a casual and carefree existence, they spend most of their time outside, sometimes getting into mischief, sometimes investigating some of the town's mysteries - one of which revolves around the story of Boo, a local boy supposedly kept chained in his basement by his father. You get the feeling that if there was anyplace you wanted to grow up as a child, it was right here in Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's - Depression or not. Until Mayella is attacked, and Tom Robinson (a black man) is accused, and Atticus is assigned to defend him. Then the story becomes dark, the racism starts to be seen; the gulf between black and white must be a shock to Scout and Jem, whose exposure to black people to this point has been to friendly Calpurnia, who kept house for their widowed father and looked after them and was more or less part of the family. Mulligan picks up the pace of the movie once the trial starts. The trial proceeds at a frenetic pace - seemingly it all takes place in a single day, which perhaps makes the point that even with Atticus doing his best and making clear the truth of what had actually happened, there was going to be no long consideration of the facts - just a rush to a pre-ordained judgement, followed by a tragedy. Then there's the suspense of what happened to Scout and Jem on their 'longest journey' - as the adult Scout (who serves as kind of the narrator) calls it in a voice over. But once that finishes, Mulligan changes the pace again, and the story slows down as the mystery of Boo from the beginning of the movie is revealed, and the film concludes on a very gentle and moving note. Just superb pacing from Mulligan. He was nominated for the Oscar as Best Director in 1963, but lost to David Lean's turn directing 'Lawrence of Arabia.' Both were fine movies, but I'd have given the nod to Mulligan.You could criticize the movie for downplaying to an extent the reality of racism. It really doesn't give us any glimpse into what it was like to be black in Maycomb - it gives far more of a white perspective on the issue of racism. But that's exactly what the novel was of course - a depiction of life in small town Alabama using Harper Lee's own upbringing as a model. I also thought that the combination of the depiction of small town life (and especially the focus at the beginning and the end on Boo) was perhaps a bit awkwardly combined with the rape trial and the reflection on racism, although Boo himself becomes an example of yet another misunderstood figure in the town. Atticus comes across as almost too good to be true. But, really, there's very little to criticize about this movie, which deserves to be thought of as a classic. (9/10)",9,3,5,19 August 2018
The Bridge on the River Kwai," More Of A Psychological Study Than A War Movie
","'The Bridge On The River Kwai' is not your typical war movies. There are no battle scenes and there's little carnage; hardly any of the action you're conditioned to expect from a 'war' movie. Even for a movie set in a prison camp there are no mass escape attempts (the one escape attempt I believe consisted of three prisoners.) This is instead more of a psychological study of the effects of captivity on soldiers - maybe even an early hint of what's come to be known as 'the Stockholm Syndrome' - as prisoners begin to identify with and in some ways sympathize with their captives.The movie is set in a Japanese prison camp where the prisoners are ordered to work on building a massive railway bridge over the River Kwai. Alec Guinness put on a strong performance as Col. Nicholson - the senior British officer among the prisoners who fights for the respect of the camp commander Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa in another strong performance). The movie for a while offered a pretty good depiction of the harshness of Japanese prison camps, and was interesting in portraying Nicholson as ultimately besting Saito as he first gains the right (guaranteed by the Geneva Convention) for the officers not to be used as manual labourers and then gets the British officers in charge of building the bridge, thus ensuring that his men would be essentially under British command. That was well portrayed, as was the fact that somewhere along the way the lines of loyalty got tested. Nicholson devotes himself to building the bridge, making an even better bridge for the Japanese than the Japanese themselves were going to build - all in the name of keeping up the morale of the British troops and building a monument to the abilities of the British army. But - as was questioned in the movie - at what point does the legitimate duty of POWs (the Geneva Convention allows for enlisted prisoners to be used by their captors for manual labour) become treasonous? The bridge and railway will be used to transport Japanese troops. Did Nicholson have to ensure that it would be so well built? And Saito suffers some of the same psychological challenges, depicted as being in torment after realizing that, while he's going to get his bridge built, he had to do it by giving up control to those who were supposed to be his prisoners. It all builds up to a powerful last scene as Allied commandos try to blow up the bridge and Nicholson tries to save it before realizing what he's doing.The psychological study is interesting and the acting is good. I thought the movie itself was a bit too long at almost three hours. William Holden's role as an American officer who escapes from the camp and then becomes part of the commando team seeking to destroy the bridge was well played but struck me as rather unnecessary - at least I wasn't sure of the need for him to have been in the camp with Nicholson and then to have him return to blow up the bridge. Some of that seemed to me to add unnecessary filler to the movie, especially the scenes in which Shears is recruited to go back to the jungle as part of the commando team.It's a good movie and interesting enough - just a little too much extraneous material and therefore a little bit too long.

Man on Fire," Denzel Washington's Performance Is Better Than The Movie As A Whole
","I watched this movie largely because of the presence of Denzel Washington in the cast. He does not disappoint. His portrayal of Creasy is both powerful and believable, and he does a good job of showing the character's development over the course of the film from a cold and largely uncaring figure ('I'm your guard, not your friend' he says to young Pita, played by Dakota Fanning) to his final admission that he loves her, a love portrayed by his self-sacrifice for her sake. As strong as Washington was, however, the movie on the whole disappointed me.The two halves of the movie are very different in tone. I thought the first half was the better. Although there's a bit of a mystery to Creasy's background, except that we know he used to work in counter-insurgency and has a drinking problem, the characters are otherwise introduced nicely and pretty well fleshed out. The first half also offers a truly scary portrait of child kidnapping in Mexico. The second half was less satisfying. It became extremely violent, losing its focus on the characters for the most part. It lacked flow and it was difficult to follow at times. I was also a bit put off by director Tony Scott's 'style' for lack of a better way to put it. His directorial decisions were at times quite irritating - and must I point out that you DO NOT need English subtitles when the characters are already speaking English - which for some strange reason happened a few times! In spite of these weaknesses, the movie manages to hold your attention, largely because you really want to find out what has happened to Pita, and the ending was a noble ending rather than a classic happy ending, which would have been too easy to include. Overall - 5/10",5,1,2,25 October 2008
Downfall," Straightforward But Very Powerful
","There's nothing particularly earth-shattering from a historical perspective here. It's simply the faithfully recounted story of the last 10 days of Adolf Hitler's life in the Bunker beneath the Chancellery. The basic story has been told before in 1981's 'The Bunker' which starred Anthony Hopkins as Hitler, but although I thought that was well done, this is far superior, primarily because of the frighteningly superb performance of Bruno Ganz as Hitler. He became 'der Fuhrer' in this movie. He was completely convincing, and offered a more complex portrayal than Hopkins' version. In this movie Hitler shifts between being a charming boss to his secretaries, even sometimes being self-deprecating with them (he says to a nervous Traudl Junge on her first day 'I make a lot of mistakes; you won't make as many as I do') to being maniacal and out-of control, raging against the betrayals of his colleagues and the failures (in his eyes) of his generals. Brilliant. Alexandra Maria Lara was almost as convincing as Junge. Her character seems to be what ties the movie together (and the movie begins and ends with actual footage of the real Junge being interviewed for the also fascinating documentary 'Im Totem Winkel.') There was also an interesting portrayal of the Goebbels, and especially Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfounch) as she struggles with her conscience at the decision to murder her five children. The setting was realistic; the atmosphere totally believable. I appreciated as well that the movie painted a pretty good picture of what life was like outside the bunker, as we see street-fighting against the Russians, largely involving the Hitler Youth, who were the only ones left to defend the city after the collapse of Germany's armies. The cowardice of Hitler's generals and other officers was clearly shown as well. They obviously know that the war is over and Germany defeated, yet to the end they won't stand up to their demonic leader. This is truly one of the most powerful movies I've seen in a long time. 9/10",9,4,6,6 March 2009
The Last King of Scotland," A Fictional Story Offers A Glimpse Of Reality
","I've been intrigued by 'The Last King Of Scotland' for some time and have finally had the opportunity to view it. The movie is an adaptation of a novel offering the fictionalized story of a young Scottish doctor (James McAvoy) who becomes personal physician to Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, and we see the descent of that country into a brutal nightmare through his eyes. The movie is for the most part well done, and I wanted to mention a couple of highlights for me.First is the performance of Forrest Whittaker playing Amin. I have to confess that I've never been totally captured by Whittaker as an actor for whatever reason, but in this, he nailed the part. I've often thought of Amin as having been a simple, brutal thug-like creature, and yet Whittaker is able to capture the complexities of the man quite well. Sometimes a childish prankster, often a brutal sadist, always the showman, and increasingly paranoid as time goes on - Whittaker captured all of that. It was a very impressive performance in what must have been a difficult role. The other thing I truly appreciated was the way the reality of Amin's reign was believably woven into the fictional storyline, as the country moves from rejoicing over his seizure of power to terror at his hands. There are a couple of scenes where the violence of the regime is portrayed quite graphically, but for the most part it's the sense of terror that really fills the movie and moves it along and makes it work.The weakest part of the movie was the fictional storyline that weaves everything together. Dr. Nicholas Garrigan ends up as Amin's personal physician in what I thought was an implausible manner - even given the unpredictability of Amin's nature. That very implausibility made it difficult to take this movie too seriously, even given the strong points I mention above. That doesn't make this a bad movie - it's a very good movie, but it does take away a little bit from it. Having said that, the best line of the movie - and what probably sums Amin up as well as anyone could - belongs to Garrigan. Beaten, and about to be brutally tortured, Garrigan looks at Amin and says 'you're a child, and that's what makes you so f***ing scary!' Overall, I'd rate this as a 7/10.",7,3,5,1 October 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," No Pretensions; Just A Lot Of Laughs
","In many ways I think the best comparison for this movie is probably 'Gilligan's Island' - and I mean that in a positive way. What I loved about 1960's comedies such as Gilligan's Island (or Hogan's Heroes or The Beverley Hillbillies) is that they had no pretension about them. They didn't claim to be making any fundamentally important social statement. They were all just about being silly enough to have fun with - and, to me at least - they worked. And that's what 'Anchorman' is - it's silly enough (stupid enough to be honest) to be able to simply sit down and have fun with. There's nothing serious about this; no important subplots; no significant life lessons. It's just good old fun, and it works wonderfully.Will Ferrell as the legendary anchorman Ron Burgundy and Christina Applegate as his romantic interest and anchor rival Veronica Corningstone play this perfectly. Their straight up serious performances are exactly what the movie needs to make it really funny. I actually thought that they worked so well together that it would be interesting to see what sort of chemistry they might have in a more serious romantic comedy. Also brilliantly funny were Ron's news team, played by Paul Rudd (as Brian Fantana), Steve Carell (as Brick Tamland) and David Koechner (as Champ Kind). These three - and especially Koechner - were hilarious in their roles.There were a couple of problems here, mind you. At times - even for this sort of movie - it went a bit over the top. I remember especially the news team rumble. It was a cute idea, but didn't add a lot to the story and added too many other rival news teams. Where the movie had to that point featured a rivalry between only two news teams (Ron's and Wes Mantooth's, played by Vince Vaughn), all of a sudden we have a third network, public television and Spanish language TV in the picture. Too much - way too much. I also though that there just wasn't enough story here to go much past an hour and a half, but this one went over 1:45. Again, too much - way too much. After a while the jokes started to get a bit old. Probably there was enough to go 1:20 to 1:25 with this.Basically, though, there were a lot of laughs here (and I loved the closing dialogue between Baxter the dog and the kodiak bear - 'fare thee well, Baxter. You shall always be the friend of the bears.') If you just want to have some fun without having to think too hard - and we all need that sometimes - this is a great one to watch. 8/10",8,1,3,11 February 2008
Ice Age: Continental Drift," A Definite Decline In The Series' Quality
","As with most sequels, the quality of the Ice Age movies is definitely regressing. I've enjoyed the others in the series (well, actually, I haven't seen The Meltdown, but I've seen the original and Dawn of the Dinosaurs) but I found Continental Drift to be disappointing in comparison. The animation is good as always, but there's too much in this that's too similar to what we've seen before (and, frankly, Scrat the sabre-toothed squirrel is getting tired and boring; same sub-plot every single time.)In Continental Drift the original content came across to me as silly and overdone. As the land begins to drift apart (quite suddenly) Manny, Sid and Diego are trapped on a floating block of ice, desperately trying to get back to their 'herd.' Then they spend basically the entire movie fighting a gang of pirates led by a primate named Captain Gutt. This battle goes on and on and on. It makes for a movie that's a little bit (well, a lot) more violent than the other Ice Age movies and while there are some humorous moments (largely revolving around Sid's grandma) it didn't seem to me to have the fun of the other movies in the series that I've seen.In fairness, my daughter's 8. She says she liked it. I can't disagree with that, so if the target audience is kids, then this is OK. It's just that the previous Ice Age movies seemed to have something for people of all ages to enjoy. This one was lacking that. (4/10)",4,18,26,15 July 2012
American Gangster," The Rise And Fall Of Empires
","This is one of the better 'ganster/mob' films that I've seen in recent years, basically because of the way the movie manages to blend personal story lines in an unromanticized way into the grimy reality of life in the underworld.The movie revolves around the story of Frank Lucas (an excellent performance by Denzel Washington) who starts off the story as the driver to one of Harlem's leading gangsters and traces his rise to the head of New York City's drug trafficking lords. As with many 'mob' stories, the truly frightening thing in many ways is how normal this guy's life is away from 'work.' He's got a mom who loves him and who he takes to church every week, a beautiful wife who seems totally in love with him, a nice home, powerful and apparently legitimate friends and he runs his business - his drug business, and a legitimate club that presumably helps to account for some of his money. Starting off with basically nothing after the mobster he works for dies, Lucas ruthlessly rises to the top in a businesslike fashion, by importing high quality drugs from Thailand, using US military planes as transports.Russell Crowe on the other hand is Detective Richie Roberts, an honest cop - one of the few apparently, and ostracized by other cops for turning in almost a million dollars rather than keeping it. One of the most memorable lines in the movie belongs to his partner (played by John Ortiz) who says by way of warning what awaits them on the force and in an attempt to convince Roberts that they should keep the money 'cops who turn in a million dollars also turn in other cops.' (In other words, there's not a cop on the force who'll trust you enough to work with you after this.) When that prediction turns out to be true, Roberts ends up heading a federal investigation into drug trafficking, and Lucas becomes his chief prey.The story of dishonest cops, mainly represented by Det. Trupo (Josh Brolin) provides the continuous backdrop to the movie, and it's very well done. It's a shocking note at the end of the movie that three quarters of the NYC Drug Enforcement Agency ended up being charged in the federal investigation.This is a very good blending together of these three stories, based on fact and brilliantly acted by Washington and Crowe, as well as the supporting cast. It's violent, but not gratuitously so. The last bit of the movie (featuring the co-operation between Lucas and Roberts after Lucas is caught) seems to fly by a little bit too fast, and one of the closing captions tells us that Lucas was released from prison in 1991, but doesn't tell us what he's been doing since then, which I would have liked to have found out - did he go back to the life, or did he stay straight? Aside from that, though, this is a very good movie that will not disappoint. 8/10",8,0,1,26 April 2008
The Green Mile," It's A Very Good Movie, But Something Just Doesn't Quite Work For Me
","This is a movie on the edge of greatness. That's what comes to my mind as I think about it. There's a great story here (actually a number of stories, intricately woven together into a whole.) There are some fantastic performances. Tom Hanks was good as always, although I didn't think he quite lived up to his Oscar winning performances in 'Forrest Gump' or 'Philadelphia.' Michael Clarke Duncan perfectly captured the character of the mysterious John Coffey. Was he a child murderer or not? That question will be answered in the movie. But there are still more questions about him that are (appropriately, I think) left to the viewers' imagination. Is he a human with special healing powers or is he some sort of supernatural being - an angel, perhaps? We don't know. But stealing the show I thought was Doug Hutchison as the sadistic prison guard Percy Wetmore. He fits the (admittedly unfair) stereotype of a prison guard: a pathetic little loser who makes himself feel like a man by abusing inmates. Hutchison was excellent.So if the story and performances are great, why do I say that the movie is only on the edge of greatness? To be quite honest, I can't quite put my finger on it but something here just didn't quite work for me. I found my attention wandering from time to time. True, it's a very long movie (well over three hours) but it wasn't really the length. Maybe there just seemed to be a lot of extraneous detail that seemed to obscure the main focus of the movie, which should have remained on Coffey throughout. Maybe it was the setting of the movie as a flashback. (I found the beginning and ending in the nursing home totally unnecessary, and would have liked the focus to be simply on the Green Mile.) I'm not sure what it was, but it just didn't quite make the grade to a great movie for me. Very good, but not quite great, although it's worth noting that Stephen King was apparently very pleased with this adaptation of his book. (It also provides a good primer in the use of an electric chair, and some graphic depictions of the results of its use.)7/10",7,0,1,31 January 2003
The Reader," After A Slow Start It Picked Up Steam
","I found the first hour or so of this movie to be somewhat tough slogging. The film is set in Germany in 5 different time periods - 1958, 1966, 1976, 1988 and 1995, and moves fairly fluidly between them. Each period offers a depiction of the somewhat complicated relationship between Michael and Hannah. The first hour deals primarily with the 1956 time period. Michael is a 15 year old who becomes ill and is helped by 36 year old Hannah. The two develop a bond, and begin an affair which is rather explicitly depicted. Michael, played in this time period by David Kross, is a fairly typical teenager smitten and somewhat obsessed with an older woman. Hannah, played throughout the movie by Kate Winslet, was a mysterious character, at the same time both cold and distant, and yet very passionate and caring, and one who loved to have Michael read to her. The affair ends abruptly when Hannah disappears. Fast forward to 1966, when Michael is a law student and his class attends a trial of SS guards, where he discovers to his horror that Hannah was one of them. It's at this point that I found the movie really picked up steam. The earlier relationship between Hannah and Michael was interesting but in all honesty not that powerful. Having seen them make love once, I didn't really need to see it 5 or 6 times. With the trial, though, a number of interesting angles began to be explored.The first came from the 1966 trial itself, and Hannah's rationalization of her actions in letting several hundred Jewish prisoners die in a fire when she could have released them. 'We couldn't let them escape,' she says. 'There would have been chaos.' When the judge continues to question her she asks with what appeared to be complete bewilderment 'What would you have done?' - a question for which the judge offered no answer. In the end Hannah is sentenced to 20 years in prison. In a way this is another film that depicts the inability to answer many questions about Nazi Germany. In that sense, Hannah is a troubling character. She accepts responsibility for what happened but expresses little guilt for it. 'Why did you join the SS?' she's asked. 'I needed a job.' You get the sense that Hannah doesn't really 'get' the horrors of the Third Reich of which she was a part - albeit a minor one. The second interesting angle was the resumption in the relationship between Michael and Hannah. Having been appalled by the fact that she was an SS guard, Michael struggles with his conscience, because he also realizes that the piece of evidence that got her the harsh sentence wasn't valid. Hannah admitted having written the report about the incident while the other guards on trial denied it, but Michael realized she couldn't have written it - she was illiterate, which was why she enjoyed being read to. It's an unanswered question why she admitted to something she didn't do. Perhaps it was to assuage an unacknowledged guilt, but it was never explained. Ten years later, Michael begins sending her tape recordings of books she liked which he's recited into a recorder. She uses them as a springboard to teach herself to read. Eventually, in 1988, when Hannah is due to be released, the prison contacts him because he's her only connection to the outside world. Their reunion in the prison is somewhat awkward, but he makes arrangements to set her up on the outside, but tragedy prevents that from happening.The relationship between the two is the focal point of the movie and it's explored in pretty good depth, with good performances by those portraying both characters (Ralph Fiennes plays the older Michael.) I wasn't entirely convinced of the need for the 1995 scenes which depict the relationship between Michael and his adult daughter. For some reason that I didn't understand, this served as a springboard to Michael's reminiscences of Hannah, but the connection wasn't clear. I also wasn't clear why Michael felt the need to take his daughter to Hannah's grave and begin to explain to her the story of their relationship. At first I wondered if, by chance, the real secret would turn out to be that the daughter was actually Hannah's daughter, but once actress Hannah Herzsprung was introduced in the role it became obvious that she was too young. As a result, I found Herzsprung's role superfluous, its significance being left largely unexplained.In the end, I found this an interesting movie that raises a number of questions and issues, although not offering any real resolution to them. 7/10",7,0,0,7 August 2009
Jaws," You Can't Ask For Anything More
","How would one even begin to criticize this? It's a brilliantly put together, fast moving and extremely scary movie. It features one of the greatest and most iconic pieces of theme music in movie history, it features tremendous performances from the cast and perhaps the scariest thing about it is that it isn't really a 'horror' movie as you would normally define 'horror.' There's no 'monster' in this - just a large great white shark that has developed a real taste for human flesh and takes up residence off an East Coach beach on the fictional community of Amity Island to feed. There's no wasting of time on this. The movie grabs you by the collar in just the first couple of minutes with the truly frightening first attack - made even more frightening by the fact that (although you know what it is) you never see the attacker. A young girl is just grabbed by something and disappears screaming in a pool of blood. It was a brilliant and very effective opening that ensured that the viewer would never lose interest, and indeed the shock of that opening means you don't take your eyes off the screen for even a moment.The first part of the movie deals with the efforts of the local sheriff (Brody, played by Roy Scheider) to convince the town to shut the beach after that first attack. He's convinced (and the local ME confirmed) that it was a shark attack. But the town is about to host thousands of tourists for the July 4 holiday. Under pressure from the mayor and town Council, the ME changes his report to a boating accident, and Brody isn't allowed to shut the beach, because it would cost the town too much money. A marine biologist (Hooper, played by Richard Dreyfuss) is brought in and confirms that this was a shark attack by a huge shark, but still the town won't listen, and disaster occurs. Finally, the mayor - stunned by the carnage that ensued - agrees to pay Quint, a local fisherman played by Robert Shaw, a bounty of $10000 to hunt and kill the shark, assisted by Brody and Hooper.It's marvellously put together. Maybe the only thing I could have done without were some of the male-bonding scenes between Quint, Brody and Hooper on board the Orca as they sing songs and compare wounds. But that's nowhere near enough to detract from the overall power of the movie, and it's in that scene that Quint shares his story as part of the crew of the USS Indianapolis, an American ship sunk by the Japanese in the closing days of World War II, with many of the crew being taken by sharks while they waited to be rescued. I had never heard that story before, checked it out after watching the movie and discovered it to be very true. The climax of the hunt as the trio is finally able to locate the great white is a tremendous fight. There are really very few moments in this that give you much of an opportunity to catch your breath. It may well be the best movie of its type ever made, and one of the best movies ever, regardless of genre. (10/10)",10,4,9,29 August 2011
Ray," Ray Charles Brought To Life
","Like almost everyone, I am familiar with the music of Ray Charles. Who hasn't heard 'Georgia ON My Mind' and 'The Mess-Around' and some of the other marvelous songs featured in this movie. But about the life of Ray Charles I was sadly ignorant until watching this. I have to say that Jamie Foxx brought Ray Charles to life brilliantly. His performance was powerful, right down to the mannerisms and voice inflections. The movie also offered a no-holds-barred account of some of the trials and tribulations Charles dealt with over the course of his life, and with some demons from the past that haunted him well into adulthood. Perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie was the heroin withdrawal scene, which was painfully realistic. The movie portrays Charles' growing awareness of and involvement with the civil rights movement, culminating in his refusal to play before a segregated audience in Georgia, which led to a ban on him performing in the state. His drug addiction and extra marital affairs are also well documented. The movie revolves around a plea from his mother when he was a child: don't let anyone or anything turn you into a cripple.' The point is that drugs did just that, and to honour his mother's memory, he had to beat them. There's not much here about his later life and career after breaking his heroin habit but up to that point, this is really powerful stuff. 9/10",9,1,2,16 July 2008
Shooter," A Conspiracy Theorist's Delight
","If you're into conspiracy theories, then this movie is definitely for you! This is the conspiracy theory to end all conspiracy theories. It seems to involve people in all walks of life. The military is involved. There's a senator. The FBI is playing a part. Local police officers are a part of this. The wealthy are definitely in on it. It's huge. One problem with the scenario is that I never quite was able to put my finger on exactly what the conspiracy was. The movie starts with a supposed American peace-keeping mission in Ethiopia going badly wrong. But from there - while Ethiopia is always front and centre - the conspiracy seems to widen and it seems to be about more than Ethiopia. The movie just started with Ethiopia. It's there that we're introduced to the character of Bob Lee Swagger (a name you have to love) - who's played by Mark Wahlberg. Swagger survives the debacle in Ethiopia, but his friend and partner doesn't and Swagger - filled with guilt - becomes a recluse back home. Then he's recruited to help stop an assassination attempt on the president (except that it really isn't) and ends up being framed for the killing of the 'Archbishop of Ethiopia' who was appearing with the president. I didn't really get the point of making the Archbishop of Ethiopia the target of the plot - unless it was to somehow imply that the Catholic Church was also involved in the conspiracy? I thought ti would have been more powerful if it had been perhaps the President of Ethiopia who was killed. Also, the scenes toward the end of the movie portraying Swagger's meeting with the director of the FBI where he clears his name seemed unlikely. At the very least, it was too easy. Just as unlikely was the meeting on the snow-capped mountain. You have to see that one to really understand it.So it's a kind of convoluted and ill-defined conspiracy, the point of which as far as I could tell was to make the rich richer? And what seem to be the climactic scenes (the two I described above) kind of sputter along unbelievably. There's certainly a lot of action in this, and it's not dull. Just a bit fuzzy around the edges if that makes any sense. I didn't really think that there was a need to develop a romance between Swagger and his late partner's widow Sarah. That seemed just too cliché for me. The performances were pretty good. Wahlberg was fine, and so was Kate Mara as Sarah and Michael Pena as the FBI agent who figures out that something's not right and ends up on Swagger's side. I did appreciate seeing veteran actors Ned Beatty as the entirely corrupt senator whose life and career seem to revolve around this conspiracy, and Danny Glover as the 'Colonel' who recruits Swagger.If you're really into conspiracy theories, this certainly gives you one to remember. If you're not - well, it's not a bad time waster anyway. (5/10)",5,0,0,20 August 2017
Inception," The Reality Is That A Dream Is Reality While You're Dreaming It
","The reality is that my summary basically sums up this movie. It has you questioning reality all the way through; in some ways similar to The Matrix, I suppose, although it's more obvious in this movie that there's questioning about reality to be done. This movie, however, lacks the philosophical/religious elements that The Matrix had, and stands as a pretty formulaic action type movie with the issues about reality thrown in.Essentially, this movie takes place within a dream - or within dreams to be more precise. That's the catch. Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb plays a man who has somehow figured out not only how to get into people's dreams but how to link various people into the same dream, so that the dream becomes reality. Some tragedy has befallen Cobb as a result of this, which is finally revealed, but it does take a while. Cobb and his team are hired by a Japanese businessman who wants them to get inside the dreams of one of his corporate rivals to convince him to break his company up, thus eliminating the rivalry. The move goes from there.It's a confusing movie. There aren't just two layers to it - reality and dream. There are actually multiple layers of various kinds of reality, as characters can enter into dreams within dreams, each successive layer becoming more and more removed from what reality really is - if you get the point. It's imaginative, but it is confusing as you try to sort the layers out. In all honesty, it's not a movie that especially appealed to me. DiCaprio's performance was good but nothing more and there were some really good special effects included in this. Aside from the dream inside a dream inside a dream gimmick, though, this stacks up as an action movie among action movies, and I didn't find it an especially noteworthy addition to the genre. A friend told me it's the sort of movie you have to watch 2 or 3 times to really get your head around it. I think I have a reasonable enough attention span, and if I can't get my head around a movie on the first watching, then it's unlikely I'm going to go back to it again. I will say that this is the sort of movie that's tailor made to produce sequels. The very last scene leaves everything wide open to continue exploring whether or not Cobb is actually back in reality. (Remember, the top was still spinning on the table as the last scene faded out.) The possibilities for sequels are virtually limitless. Everything is based on a dream or dreams. You could have anything from comedy to action to historical epic to outer space adventure and it would all make sense, because it's all a dream or dreams! Still, while I can have some appreciation for the ingenuity of the writers to come up with a story that has the potential to literally go on forever, I didn't find enough here to make me want to look at the inevitable sequels.",4,8,12,30 January 2011
Defiance," Inspiring But Not Great
","No doubt that 'Defiance' is a very inspiring movie. Set during the winter of 1941-42, just after Nazi Germany has attacked the Soviet Union, the movie follows the exploits of the 3 Bielski brothers, who watched their father be murdered by German troops and escape into the forest, only to end up becoming a rallying point and leaders for other displaced Jews. The movie portrays rivalries among the brothers themselves, rivalries within the group of Jews they're leading, difficulties in dealing with the Soviet troops, who should be their allies, as well as the hardships of dealing with hunger, cold and illness. Ultimately it leads to a pretty good climactic fight against Nazi troops. Yet, for all that I can't say it's great.I've seen better and more inspiring Holocaust-inspired movies: think 'Schindler's List,' 'The Grey Zone,' and even the fictional 'Jakob the Liar.' Although the last half hour or so, leading up to the confrontation with the Germans, was quite good, I thought the movie was inconsistent up to that point. It lacked flow, and failed completely to draw me in tightly to the story. If it's at all accurate (and I'm not at all familiar with the events on which it's supposed to be based) then it certainly is a story that deserves to be told, but in truth I can't give it higher than a 6/10.",6,40,77,11 July 2009
Sherlock Holmes," A Definitely Interesting Although Overly Long Take On The Famous Detective
","Highlighting this adaptation of the character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are the performances by the lead actors - Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law as Holmes and Watson, respectively. Both were very good and both successfully put their own unique spins on very familiar characters. Downey's Holmes is still a brilliant detective, inexplicably deducing things from the smallest clues available, but in this he's also an action figure, and a fighter, engaging in the public sport of bare knuckle brawling. In short, there's a wee hint of a darker side to the great detective that I've not come across before. Unique though that take on the character may be, I was never really convinced that I liked that take on the character. In some ways it was too unique. You have certain expectations of Sherlock Holmes, and while an action version of the character may be what's needed in a big screen production, it's still a bit jarring. But Downey was excellent in the role. No criticism of him. Law's Watson was also unique. In the stories he's the loyal assistant to Holmes - and sometimes even more brilliant than the detective himself. His brilliance is maintained here, but he's not quite as loyal in this. In fact, he's ready to bail on Holmes; he's engaged and wants out of the partnership; he's ready to move on from the cluttered office he shares with Holmes. There's also more emphasis on Watson's identity as a medical doctor here. Law also worked well in his role, and to me, the differences in the Watson character were less jarring than those in Holmes.Downey and Law and their characters aside, though, I simply was not taken in by the story, about some secret society and its leader apparently hell bent on taking over first Britain and then the world, using trickery to convince those around them that they possessed some type of supernatural power. The story was long and drawn out, and while interesting at times (and even though it did make effective use of humour throughout) I found it to be inconsistent. I have to say that I was less than enamoured with director Guy Ritchie's repeated use of slow motion to anticipate action moments that were going to happen, only to then repeat those very same action moments in normal time - which dragged this out even more.In the end, I wasn't really impressed with the movie. Downey and Law I was impressed with, but I found the story to be less than stellar in all honesty. (4/10)",4,1,1,24 September 2011
WALL·E," Disney's Look At The Future
","In many ways this is a pretty typical piece of Disney/Pixar animation - except in this, instead of cute, adorable animals we have cute, adorable robots. Set about 700 years in the future, the story begins on an earth that is now uninhabitable because of the mounds of garbage that have accumulated. Humans are extinct (on earth at least) and the star of the movie is a little robot called WALL-E, programmed apparently to collect, sort and dispose of garbage. He continues his job long after the humans have disappeared, his only companion being a cockroach (they really can survive anything) - and WALL-E is lonely. Suddenly an alien robot named Eva drops in from space, and WALL-E falls head over heels, eventually accompanying her (somewhat against his will) to her spaceship. Once aboard the spaceship I thought the movie started to take on a bit of a 'Battlestar Galactica' feel, as the descendants of the humans who had escaped earth find themselves struggling for control of the ship against a group of rogue robots.A lot here was very good. The animation was brilliant. WALL-E especially seemed almost real rather than animated. The relationship between WALL-E and Eva was developed nicely, and I felt a great deal of empathy for WALL-E as he battled his loneliness. The writers also managed the difficult task of telling us a story with very little dialogue (neither WALL-E nor Eva talk, except to stammer out each other's name.) There's a rather obvious political message in this, warning us about the environmental damage we're causing to the planet. On the down side, the story was rather predictable, and I'm not too sure that this movie would get a great reception among children, since the lack of dialogue and somewhat complex storyline might make it difficult especially for younger ones to follow. As its rating suggests, this animated feature might have more impact on adults than on children.On balance, I liked it, although I'm not inclined to add it to a collection so I could watch it over and over. 6/10",6,4,9,11 July 2009
Stalag 17," Pretty Good POW Camp Mystery
","The mystery in this starts right from the beginning. Two POWs attempt to escape from Stalag 17 (apparently, the toughest POW camp in Germany, with a perfect record.) POW Sefton (played by William Holden, in a role for which he won an Oscar) bets the others that they won't make it. They don't. Everyone suspects that there's a 'stoolie' in Barracks 4 passing information on to the Germans. Sefton trades with the guards, and gets a lot of extra privileges from them, and so he becomes the prime suspect. From the viewer's point of view, it's pretty obvious that Sefton isn't the guy. First, it would have been way too obvious, and, second, if he had been the Germans wouldn't have made him such an obvious target. So the mystery revolves around who the stoolie actually is, and director Billy Wilder does a pretty good job of keeping us guessing. There's nothing that really gives it away until that mystery is finally revealed a little more than halfway through the movie with a rather devious question from Sefton (who's committed himself to finding out who the stoolie is) about Pearl Harbor, but the solution to one mystery leads to another - what are the POWs going to do with the real stoolie?This is a pretty decent movie. Aside from a few brief moments, it's not especially exciting, but the mystery is well enough developed that it keeps you watching all the way through. It does have a lot of unnecessary material. Animal's obsession with Betty Grable is funny for a little while, but does get tired eventually, and the whole Christmas Party in the Barracks goes on a bit too long. I also thought the whole idea of female Russian prisoners in a separate compound of the same camp (who looked - shall we say - pretty healthy!) was a real stretch to the credibility of the movie. It seems to me that this is a bit over-rated, although the story is generally good, as are the performances - Holden's, I thought (while good) being somewhat understated for a Lead Actor win. As an aside, it's interesting to note that this must have given birth to the later TV series Hogan's Heroes. There are too many similarities in the basic story to be coincidental (the toughest POW Camp in Germany from which no one escapes, the bald-headed Commandant - played here by Otto Preminger and in the series by Werner Klemperer, and even a character named Sgt. Schultz.)",7,1,3,22 February 2010
Arrival," It's Tough To Stick With, But A Powerful Ending Makes The Effort Worthwhile
","Perhaps it's strange to review a movie starting with the end, but somehow with 'Arrival' this makes sense. Everything, to me, led up to the question that Louise (Amy Adams) asked Ian (Jeremy Renner) as the movie approached its close - basically, 'if you could see your whole life laid out before you, would you change anything?' That's a thought provoking question - and put in the context of this movie, it's a powerful question. As the movie started, we seemed to be offered a series of flashbacks of Louise's life. She was a mother, her baby grew into a young girl. Louise was a good mother, she adored her daughter, but something happened and her husband left her and her daughter got sick and died. What a downer of a way to start a movie. And how did it possibly relate to a story about aliens? Clearly this was not going to be a typical action-packed alien invasion/sci fi movie. But that opening was was what kept me watching. It was clear that the daughter's death had to be central to whatever was going to happen. But how? Louise was a Linguistics professor. One day, apparently after her daughter's death, 12 alien ships ('shells') appeared in various parts of the world. Louise - the linguist - is brought in by the US government to try to figure out a way of communicating with the aliens, to figure out why they're here and where they're from. And she's teamed with Ian - a scientist. And really, until the last 10 minutes of the movie, that's about it. The movie seems to be about trying to communicate with the aliens (and to some extent about the various nations trying to communicate with each other.) I took some Linguistics classes when I was in university. I enjoyed them, but I never would have thought that linguistics would make the basis of a good or entertaining movie - and I was right. To be honest, watching Louise try to talk to the 'heptapods' (because the aliens had seven limbs) was tedious and at times excruciating. Why are the aliens here? That was the question for all of the characters in the movie. Why am I watching this movie? That was the question for me through most of it. But the opening scenes with the daughter kept me watching. I had to figure out how those fit in with the story. And - I'll be honest - I still don't entirely understand it. Somehow the aliens' way of communicating has something to do with time. The aliens don't have a linear view of time. It isn't from the past into the future. It's everything together, all at once. And somehow this has impacted Louise. Her daughter didn't die in the past - her daughter will die in the future. And as it all comes to an end - after Louise has saved the day by convincing the Chinese (who were about to attack the shell that had landed on their territory) to back down (which maybe turned Louise into a bit too much of a hero; I think the point could have been made in a different way) she poses that question to Ian: 'if you could see your whole life laid out before you, would you change anything?'Ian's the father! Or, he's going to be the father! He asks her, 'do you want to make a baby?' And suddenly the question is for Louise to answer: 'if you could see your whole life laid out before you, would you change anything?' She knows that if she makes this baby with Ian, this baby is going to die as a teenager. Would you change that? Would you not have the baby? Would you not marry Ian? Because the marriage is going to fail. There are things in all our lives that we probably think on the surface we would change if we could. But that question made me think - if I changed the things that weren't so good, that would change all the things that are really great! Everything would be different, because everything is connected to everything else - like the aliens who made clear to Louise that they were just one out of twelve alien ships, all connected. Louise would marry Ian and have the baby. And, having thought about it, I don't think I'd change any of those things in my life that aren't great - because even the not great stuff is connected to the great stuff, and if I didn't have the not great stuff, I probably wouldn't have the great stuff either. If that makes any sense. Very rarely does a movie make you do something as deep as contemplating the very nature of your life. This one did.Believe me, that last 10 minutes is worth it just for that one question that it raised, and for the explanation of the movie's somewhat strange timeline. It's kind of a tough slog to get get there. It's tedious at times; it's confusing at times. There are things that are simply unbelievable. The aliens seem to have an incredibly complex way of communicating, and Louise really didn't seem to have that much time with them, so her deciphering of their language in that short time was hard to accept. But those opening scenes do keep you watching, and the closing that ties it together makes the whole exercise of watching it worth it. (7/10)",7,0,4,3 September 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," A Bit Over-Rated Perhaps, But Still A Good Movie With Great Performances From Freeman and Robbins
","Deliberately (some might even say slowly in places) paced, 'The Shawshank Redemption' alternates between offering a grittily realistic portrayal of life in prison and flights of fancy that make the story too unbelievable to really be accepted. There is an interesting subplot (which doesn't take up much of the movie but which does make the viewer ponder) about the difficulties of adjusting to life in the real world after extended periods of incarceration. The performances from the two leads are excellent. Morgan Freeman puts on his usual outstanding performance as 'Red' - the wise old con through whose eyes the story is told, and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresnce, a young banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover who has to adjust to the nightmare of prison life. Among the supporting cast I was impressed with Bob Gunton as the Bible-spouting but corrupt Warden Norton, who uses Andy's financial expertise to enrich himself, and James Whitmore as Brooks, imprisoned for fifty years and terrified when he is finally granted parole and who, unable to adjust to life on the outside, yearns only to be back in the only home he ever knew - prison. It's an interesting twist - experience also by Red later on in the movie - that freedom can seem to be like a prison for those so accustomed to the regimentation of life in an institution.While the movie is impressive and engrossing all the way through, though, there are some weaknesses to the story that bothered me a bit. (There are some spoilers ahead.)I found it difficult to imagine prison guards from all over the State of Maine bringing their tax returns to Andy. It just didn't seem to me like something that would have happened. It also struck me as unlikely that a letter-writing campaign from one solitary prisoner (even one that lasted six years, one letter a week) would have convinced the State to fund the improvements Andy got for the prison library. I would rather expect that after a while the letters would simply start to be discarded. Andy's escape also bothered me. It was too 'easy' - even though it took twenty years. And how did he keep that suit so spotless and unwrinkled while crawling through that dirty sewer? Mind you, the moments leading up to the discovery of his escape were among the most dramatic in the movie. The very end of the story was also clearly telegraphed some time before.Frankly speaking, I think 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a bit over-rated here at IMDb, being ranked the second best movie of all time, but this is still a very, very good movie, and an excellent portrayal (through Andy) of the survival of the human spirit in even the toughest times. Personally, I give it a 7/10.",7,15,34,31 August 2002
Rango," It's Fun For All Ages
","Rare is the animated feature that will be of appeal to ages 6 to 96, but 'Rango' seems to have accomplished that balance rather nicely. Kudos to all who were involved with this production, but especially to the animators. The animation in this was absolutely brilliant. While it's obvious that walking and talking animals are animated, the details of the Town of Dirt and the desert landscape take on a definite sense of reality. In those scenes where there are no characters on screen it would be very easy to forget that this is in fact an animated feature.The story has something for everyone. Basically, this is a Western in animated form. Rango is a pet chameleon who as a result of a car accident gets separated from his family on a highway in the middle of the desert. Being a domestic animal, he has no idea what to do or how to survive until a helpful armadillo tells him the direction to a nearby town where he should be able to get water. Stumbling across the desert, he finally comes across the small Town of Dirt, populated entirely by animals of various sorts. Struggling to fit in, he spins a few yarns about himself and his adventures and where he came from, and he ends up quite accidentally as a local hero and as the local sheriff who suddenly has to confront the town's great mystery - the water supply is quickly disappearing.The details of the story are really oriented far more toward adults than children, and those who let children watch this should know going in that there's some mildly harsh language and a few scenes that might be frightening for little ones. But they'll enjoy the animation. Kids love animated animals - and all ages will enjoy some of the action sequences in the movie, which - like the rest of the animation - is very well done, and quite believable.I thought this weakened perhaps a bit in the last half hour or so. At that point (really, with the introduction of Jake the Rattlesnake, who was as the rest very well animated, but who was also a rather menacing character) a lot of the fun of the movie disappeared, and it actually became a rather heavy story toward the end. The ultimate moral of the story is that Rango has to find himself and be himself. In the end, once the reason for the disappearing water supply becomes obvious, there's also a bit of an environmental message, but it wasn't preachy at all, and for the most part it was very entertaining.

Centurion," If You Like Graphic, Bloody Violence This Movie Is For You
","An over-extended Empire. Its troops stationed on the far frontier, not really understanding why they're there in a place they don't understand, don't care about and just want to get out of so that they can return home. An enemy that's simply relentless and will not give up. A politician who just wants to make a name for himself so that he can get back into the halls of power and isn't above covering up uncomfortable truths. It could be about the beginning of the end for any number of Empires throughout history - including the current American Empire. In that sense, I see this story as a sort of parable; a reflection of today's world put into a very different context. To that extent, it has some - some very little, mind you - point to it.The context of the movie is actually the Roman Empire, and Roman troops stationed and fighting on the extreme northern frontier of the Empire, in Britannia. It's before the construction of Hadrian's Wall, and the Ninth Legion is in Pict territory (basically, Scotland) and is finding itself unable to subdue the pesky Picts. The movie is based on a legend about the Ninth Legion, which did in fact disappear from Roman history sometimes in the 2nd century (and many historians do believe it perished in Britannia.) It's a very violent, very bloody and very graphic movie. If you like those things you'll love this. The story is pretty bare bones and unimaginative really. After a fierce (violent, bloody and graphic) battle against the local Picts, what's left of the Ninth Legion (and it ain't much) has to try to find its way back to the safety of the Roman lines, all the while being hunted down by the Picts. After all that the movie chose to end on what I found to be an awkward romantic note that just didn't fit with the whole tenor of the story.Michael Fassbender starred in this as the commander of the ragged troops trying to find their way home. He was decent enough, but the whole tenor of the movie was its graphic bloodiness with a handful of 'gross-out' scenes - such as the survivors killing a deer and drinking its blood and eating half digested moss from its stomach. I'd have to give some marks to Olga Kurylenko for her silent performance as Etain - the Pict scout who's out for revenge because years before the Romans killed her father, raped and killed her mother and raped her and cut her tongue out. Her 'Etain' was not someone I'd want to cross!But you'd really have to like blood and gore with only a very limited storyline to make this worth watching. (2/10)",2,2,6,8 September 2018
The Conjuring," Our House Gave It A Split Decision
","'The Conjuring' certainly caused a split in our household! My wife loved it. She thought it was great. I, on the other hand, struggled just to stay awake (and I lost that battle at least twice.) The split was interesting, because based on the genre, this was the sort of movie that should have caused the very opposite reactions.To be frank, every movie that claims to be based on true events loses a couple of points with me right off the top and has to struggle to get those points back. The Conjuring did not get them back. Yes, I know that the real life Andrea Perron (one of the daughters) says that the story is pretty accurate, but she frankly also has a vested interest in getting people interested, being herself a writer. So, take it with a grain of salt.The basic story revolves around the Perron family, who buy an old house that has quite a dark and secret past - and the past becomes the present when the Perrons move in. Overwhelmed by what they experience in the house, they turn to Ed and Lorraine Warren - a demonologist and clairvoyant. The Warrens are real, and are themselves controversial, with a lot of people questioning their reliability. I can't honestly say that I found anything here that raised this above any other haunted house movie, mind you. It has the requisite 'jump' moments, but nothing out of the ordinary for the genre. I really wasn't impressed with the performances and the story failed completely to draw me in.My wife, however, loved it. In deference to her good taste (she married me, after all) I'll go a little higher than I was planning to go. (3/10)",3,2,5,3 January 2014
Prometheus," Ridley Scott's Failed Return To The Alien Sci-Fi Genre
","Ridley Scott, of course, made his first significant directorial splash with 'Alien' - a long, long time ago now. He basically left outer space, alien sci fi behind after that one and went with more mainstream material, and 'Prometheus' was really his re-entry to that genre. The influence of 'Alien' is obvious in this. There are lot of connections, and a lot of similarities. One thing I liked about 'Alien' was that it didn't seem to set out to scare the pants off the viewer. It was a tense type of movie, with a lot of suspense, but not much by way of real horror or gore. This was probably a bit heavier on the horror/gore metre than 'Alien' was, but not much. But it didn't capture the overall atmosphere of that earlier effort by Scott.To really work, this type of movie has to have at least one of three things going for it. It either has to be frightening, or it has to be suspenseful, or it has to have a pretty interesting moral or ethical or philosophical reflection going on at its heart. I didn't think 'Prometheus' really accomplished any of that, and because of that I can't say that the story really managed to pull me in. There were moments of horror; there were moments that made me jump a little - but they were few and far between. At the base of the movie is a philosophical reflection about the origin of life, with some attention made to religion, God, etc., but while that was there, it was never really central, nor was it ever really satisfactorily resolved, with the end result being that this often seemed to lack a clear focus. What was Ridley Scott trying to accomplish with this? What statement was being made? What impact was it supposed to have on the viewer? I'm really not able to answer any of those questions.Neither the cast nor the characters held me spellbound. I thought the performances were a bit dry, and the character development was rather weak. Aside from Dr. Shaw (Noomi Rapace) I can't say that I really got drawn into anyone's story in particular, so I really didn't care that much for them.In the end, 'Prometheus' disappointed me. Perhaps Ridley Scott, in returning to the genre that made him famous, tried too hard to make 'Prometheus' a reflection of 'Alien,' but it didn't work very well. (3/10)",3,3,6,22 February 2013
Halloween," The Slasher Film Against Which All Other Slasher Films Must Be Measured
","It's interesting to watch 'Halloween' 30 years after it was made, and to realize just how influential this movie has been in the genre. Almost every 'slasher' movie that followed seems to have found some of its inspiration from this. From Jason's mask, to villains who won't die, to terrified teens targeted for death, it all seems to have begun here, in a pretty straightforward and not particularly fancy movie that nevertheless managed to get almost everything right.On Halloween night 1963, Michael Myers bludgeoned his sister to death. For some reason, exactly 15 years later he escapes from his maximum security prison and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois to go on another killing spree. The power of this movie comes from two things - the atmosphere, which is appropriately suspenseful throughout, and the musical score, which fits perfectly and which cannot be forgotten once its heard. In all honesty I thought the acting was somewhat inconsistent, with the exception of Donald Pleasance. As Dr. Loomis, Michael's psychiatrist who is absolutely convinced that Michael is evil and should be locked up forever, Pleasance is superb. The rest of the cast - even including Jamie Lee Curtis to be honest - had its ups and downs, and some of the lines seemed spoken in a bit of a monotone which didn't suit the action. That's explained probably by the inexperience of a very young group of actors, none of whom (Curtis being the notable exception) really became significant players in Hollywood.Given the way the genre progressed, it's surprising how little blood there is here. (Later makers of the slasher films should have taken this as inspiration too.) We see some murders, but they aren't the focal point, and they're not gruesomely depicted. I also found the 'relationship' between Laurie (Curtis) and Michael strange (from the vantage point of the sequels.) Michael doesn't really seem to have targeted her in this movie. I know he keeps popping up in her life once he gets to Haddonfield, but she only ends up in danger because she goes to check out the house where he's doing the killing. (True, this is really only a problem in the sequels, where Laurie really is the target and there is this strange connection between them.) This short (90 minute) movie is the grand-daddy of movies of this type. It's not a classic Hollywood work, but as slasher films go it remains (in my opinion) the absolute best. 8/10",8,0,1,6 July 2008
Paths of Glory," Gritty And Realistic
","A great piece of work by director Stanley Kubrick, its only weakness being that it comes across a little too obviously as a piece of anti-war and anti-military propaganda (not that there's anything wrong with that, but I really don't care for being too openly preached at in the course of a movie.)That is, however, the only weakness one could identify with this movie. Kirk Douglas put on a fabulous performance as Colonel Dax, a French Army officer during the First World War, whose troops are ordered to launch an impossible attack on a German position by their commander, General Broullard (Adolphe Menjou), only to then see three of the soldiers arrested as examples and subjected to a court martial for cowardice - defended by Dax - because the impossible attack failed.The portrayal of the upper echelons of the military is not flattering. Broullard (although making frequent visits to the trenches) has little compassion for his men, treating projected casualty estimates as if they were, indeed, nothing more than numbers on a piece of paper. Death in battle is portrayed by virtually all the generals we're introduced to as a glorious thing, with even unjust executions being justified as necessary to build the morale of the remaining soldiers. The best line of the entire movie was spoken by Dax, who - after being subjected to one of those ridiculous arguments about how noble executions are - asks General Miraud (George Macready) 'do you really believe all that nonsense?'The soldiers in the trenches are treated with respect by Kubrick, whose clear bias is against the decision-makers. Dax comes across in the film as the only truly noble officer, who really cares about his men and about justice and who despises the military caste for its insensitivity, corruption and just plain stupidity. (This being accounted for by Dax being a famous criminal lawyer in civilian life, rather than a career officer.) In fact, Dax is so noble that in the end General Miraud can't understand that everything Dax did was because he believed in it; Miraud preferring to believe that Dax was simply out for Broullard's command, and then dismissing him when he discovers that Dax is an honest man as a simple 'idealist.' The clear message is simple: there's no room for idealists in the military.It's a well filmed movie; gritty in its realism. The trench scenes come across as believable, and the court martial scenes are compelling in their absurdity. All in all, an excellent film.9/10",9,0,1,20 July 2002
1408," A One-Man Performance By John Cusack In A Sub-Par Supernatural Thriller
","The only reason I can think of to go out of your way to see this movie would be if you're a big fan of John Cusack. I've seen him in movies I thought were very good; I've seen him in others I've thought were not so good. '1408' falls somewhere in the middle - mediocre/fair - but give credit to John Cusack: in a movie that for large stretches was little more than a one man performance on his part he's very good, and manages to hold the attention of the viewer enough to get through a largely disappointing movie that's neither very original nor particularly frightening.My first reaction after watching this is that Stephen King must be rapidly running out of story ideas. This movie is about a writer who finds himself in an isolated place, cut off from the world, with supernatural goings on all around and rapidly going crazy because of it. Isn't that the basic plot of 'The Shining?' Take away the supernatural element and isn't it the basic plot of 'Misery?' And how many Stephen King stories have to feature writers? (Here, add at least the movie 'Stand By Me' based on King's story 'The Body' to the list.) And the real problem is that '1408' isn't anywhere near as good as any of those three.Basically, Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a paranormal investigator and debunker (who is dealing with demons of his own, revolving largely around the death of his young daughter) who is writing a book about his experiences staying in supposedly haunted hotels. He gets a mysterious postcard that tells him to check out Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York. He investigates and discovers that a lot of strange things have happened there and so decides it's a good topic for a chapter of his book. The story goes on from there.There are several problems with the story, not the least of which is - as I said above - that it's neither very original nor particularly frightening. Arriving at the hotel, Enslin is met by the hotel manager Gerald Olin (played by Samuel L. Jackson.) Olin doesn't want him in Room 1408; he doesn't rent 1408 because of the many deaths that have occurred there over the years - 56 as I recall, some of natural causes, others not so natural. Here's the first plot problem for me. Why 56? That's a lot of deaths for one room. The hotel management would have to have one of two reactions. Either it's nothing more than a bizarre coincidence, in which case why bother refusing to rent the room? It's just a coincidence. Or, they believe (as Olin does) that there's something going on with the room - in which case why wait for 56 deaths to start refusing to rent it? Why not 40? Or 30? Or 10? Why suddenly after #56 say 'wow! Something's really weird with this room! We better not rent it any more!' In any event, a provision of the civil rights act forces the hotel to rent the room to Enslin. Once in Room 1408, Enslin doesn't strike me as a very good paranormal investigator/debunker. In the first little while that's he's in the room three things happen - the clock radio turns on by itself, a window slams shut on his hand and injures him, and there's an unexpected blast of scalding water from the bathroom sink. Quite a coincidence, but surely a cynical debunker such as Enslin would quickly think of logical explanations for them (I did, and I'm neither cynical nor a paranormal investigator and debunker!) Instead, Enslin is terrified and immediately tries to get out of the room! The movie continues to work through fairly routine 'chills' - and you start to think it's over at one point with a logical explanation of what happened (without giving too much away, I'll just say I was glad this didn't end with the beach scene as it looked like it might; that would have made a mediocre movie a dreadful one.) There's never any real resolution to the mystery of the room. Near the beginning of the movie, Olin tells Enslin that it's not about ghosts or anything else - the room itself is evil. That's as close as we come to an explanation. And the closing scene served little purpose to me. Was it to show us that Enslin's wife now believed his story? Frankly, I didn't care if she believed him or not. Was it to show us that Enslin was now convinced? I always assumed he was. Was it to convince the viewer that this really happened? Again, I always assumed from the context of the movie that it did. This was altogether disappointing.A note on Samuel L. Jackson to close. If you're a Jackson fan, don't watch this because he's in it. He played his role well, but the role is very limited, and his presence - to me at least - neither added to the movie nor detracted from it. The producers clearly just wanted a name to go alongside Cusack and they found Jackson, but I or anyone else could have played the part of Olin. (Memo to Hollywood producers: the next time you have a nothing part to fill, I come a lot cheaper than Samuel L. Jackson!) As far as the movie's concerned? On the 'shiver-metre' (Enslin's rating for the creepiness of the hotels he stays at) - 4/10.",4,2,4,24 April 2008
Taken 2," Good Action, But Extremely Implausible And Nowhere Near As Good As The Original
","As others (many others) have noted, 'Taken 2' doesn't even come close to being as good as 'Taken.' And, as others (many others) have noted, the movie is weakened badly by the unbelievability of much of what happens. There were several, but really three things stuck with me most. At the beginning of the movie, during the funeral scene, why are Albanians speaking Arabic? I get that they're Muslims (of course) and I understand that the Koran isn't considered the true Koran unless it's read in Arabic, but why would Albanians speak Arabic as a matter of routine? They'd speak Albanian in every day life. Then I wondered, why is there a U.S. Embassy in Istanbul? Istanbul isn't the capital of Turkey - Ankara is. The U.S. Embassy in Turkey would be in Ankara. There'd probably be a U.S. consulate in Istanbul, but the building (when we see it) is clearly marked as the Embassy. Finally, Kim (Maggie Grace)- who was the object of her dad's search in 'Taken' and who couldn't pass a driving test back home in California - sure did a pretty good job driving through the crowded streets of Istanbul! There are other things that didn't make a lot of sense, but those were the things that really stood out to me.Now, having said that, if you can suspend your disbelief this is a pretty decent action movie. There are some great chase scenes (including the one in which Kim is inexplicably pulling off some pretty fancy moves), and some pretty good fight scenes. Liam Neeson, who reprised the role of Bryan, seems (somehow) to take the whole thing quite seriously. I thought the movie was rather slow starting but once the action started it had a certain fun quality to it. Its main problem is that it's just not as good as the original.

The Silence of the Lambs," Flawless; An Absolutely Spectacular Treasure
","Immeasurably superior to its disappointing sequel 'Hannibal,' 'Silence of the Lambs' must surely rank as one of the absolute greatest thrillers of all time. Given the nature of the movie, there is surprisingly little graphic violence contained in it. The story focuses instead on the complex psychological relationship between FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and the imprisoned cannibalistic serial killer and ex-psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins.) Both Foster and Hopkins are brilliant. Foster has the larger role, and carries it off well, but Hopkins steals the movie with a frighteningly realistic portrayal of a frightening serial killer. Lecter, approached by the FBI because they believe he might be of assistance in helping identify a current serial killer known as 'Buffalo Bill,' sees in the FBI's interest an opportunity to escape imprisonment, and plays a series of mind games with Starling (and anyone else who wants to speak to him about the case.)Director Jonathon Demme effectively weaves two stories (the hunt for the serial killer, and the Starling-Lecter relationship) together into a taut thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat. And, in the end, has there ever been a better, funnier and more thoroughly chilling line in any movie than Lecter's closing comment to Clarice: 'I have to go now. I'm having an old friend for dinner.'I can't identify a single weakness in this movie. 10/10.",10,4,7,23 September 2002
Vanilla Sky," Picks Up Steam As It Moves Along
","After the first hour or so of this movie I was thinking 'this is truly bizarre.' I was finding it very difficult to follow and in all honesty not particularly interesting. But it does get better as it moves along, and by the end of the movie it had actually turned into a decent sci-fi adventure whose ending I was really very interested in.The story, as I suggest, is a bit confusing in the first hour or so and it takes some real commitment to stick with it, but it's helped along by better than average performances from the main leads - Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz. The love triangle that's represented by the three is a bit of a mystery, particularly the nature of the relationship between Cruise and Diaz, and how that relationship ends is quite shocking and was the point at which I really started to sit up and pay close attention. From there on it's interesting to watch as Cruise tries to sort out fantasy from reality and comes to terms with his ultimate fate and the decision it leaves him with.Overall this is a better than average movie; a bit long perhaps, but worth the time to watch.6/10",6,6,12,18 May 2003
Any Given Sunday," Definitely Not A Touchdown!
","A very - VERY (and unnecessarily) - long film exploring the relationship between Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), an old school professional football coach who has difficulty adjusting to the modern game and its players, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) the young owner of the Miami Sharks football team that he coaches, and who is quite willing to sacrifice her players health in order to win, and Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx), the young third-string quarterback who, due to injuries, takes over the team, becomes a star, and becomes arrogant and uncoachable as a result.The movie isn't too bad, except for the interminable length. There is far too much focus, in my opinion, on the on-field action. I like football, and this is a football movie, so obviously some of that is necessary, but there was altogether too much of it. It was generally well-done, but the movie could easily have been cut by about a half hour if the extraneous on-field action was left out.The performances were very good. Al Pacino was very convincing as the old coach, and Jamie Foxx was perfectly cast as the arrogant young quarterback. I confess that I did a double take when I discovered that Cameron Diaz was playing the hard as nails owner of a football team (!), but there's a logical enough reason that she became the owner (she inherited the team from her father), and she actually pulls off the role fairly well. Thee are also cameos from folks as diverse as Charlton Heston and Barry Switzer.I found the development of the 'Willie Beamen' story difficult to swallow, though. Granted that anything's possible in pro sports, but it seems hard to accept that in the course of what seemed to be just a few games, Beamen went from an unsure third-stringer who threw up from nerves whenever he had to play to the confident, cocky and arrogant superstar. That detracted from the plausibility of the story. As to the rest of the story, I'm not a pro football player so can't say with certainty whether the lifestyle depicted is realistic or just a rehashing of stereotypes.The movie's not bad. It held my interest all the way, and I loved the ending I have to admit. Way to go, D'Amato! But the problems I noted above really hurt my overall rating of the movie. It's definitely not a touchdown, but maybe could qualify as a field goal. I gave it 5/10, but for the most part an enjoyable 5.",5,0,0,2 June 2001
Bruce Almighty," A Hilarious Movie With Some Thought-Provoking Moments
","At one point in this movie - as Bruce (Jim Carrey) gets his revenge on Evan (Steven Carell) - I was almost rolling around on the floor of the theatre in tears, the scene was so funny. That one scene alone made it worthwhile to see this movie, but having said that there's far more to this movie than one funny scene. It is a well-put together, well directed and well acted movie which is very funny and yet at the same time manages to address some very serious philosophical and theological questions along the way.The story is surprisingly (and misleadingly) simple. Bruce is always complaining that God never gives him a break, so God (played extremely well by Morgan Freeman) decides to teach him a lesson by letting Bruce play God for a while. Bruce is given two restrictions on his power: you can't fool with free will (and I'm embarrassed to admit that I can't remember the second.) For a while Bruce finds his new powers fun, but then discovers the challenges. One person's free will can impact negatively on another's, and there's nothing even God - who grants free will out of love - can do about it. When Bruce finally sets himself to the task of trying to help others rather than just amuse himself, he also discovers that saying 'yes' to every prayer (which so many people seem to think God should do) doesn't work very well, because some people's prayers contradict others. As a clergyman, I thought these points were made well - in a humourous vein, but noting the seriousness of the issue.There were only a couple of things in the movie that didn't appeal to me. As I said, I can only remember one of the two conditions God placed on Bruce's use of His powers, but I am sure that one of them was NOT 'you have to use your power to help other people.' And yet, after Bruce amuses himself for a while, God comes to him and lectures him because he hasn't used his powers to help others. Huh? That was not one of the conditions. God became inconsistent in that moment. Also a note abut Jim Carrey: he is a very funny actor who falls into the trap of over-acting. He should let his humour flow a little more naturally. Sometimes he comes across as forced.However, this is a great movie (also featuring a good performance from Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's girlfriend Grace.)8/10",8,0,2,5 June 2003
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Another Fun Adventure
","I haven't seen the second movie of the series, and so can only compare 'Dawn of the Dinosaurs' to the first. Aside from the equally superb animation, I thought this story was weaker than the original (as are most sequels) but still was good fun. Here, Sid the Sloth is working with babies again (just as he worked with the human baby in the first movie.) This time, it's a trio of dinosaur babies that he stumbles upon and decides to raise as his own. Yeah, I know, dinosaurs and mammals didn't co-exist - but it's a kid's movie - and the writers got around that by turning this into a kind of 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth' type adventure. Sid discovers the eggs after crashing through the ice into an underground world where dinosaurs still rule. Unfortunately, Mamma Dinosaur wants her babies back, and Sid ends up being taken along for the ride, which means that Diego, Manfred et. al. have to set out on their own adventure to rescue him.What I thought was much weaker here than in the original movie was the lack of any real poignancy, such as Manfred's memories of his family or Diego's 'death scene.' This movie simply comes on like an action/adventure with some comedy (and some of it pretty funny) thrown in. Personally, I didn't care that much for the new character of Buck, a one-eyed weasel who's essentially exiled himself in dino-world and who ends up leading the gang in their search. It's a good movie for kids (although some of the dinosaur scenes might be a bit scary for younger ones.) 6/10",6,1,3,14 July 2009
Signs," An Interesting Combination of Horror Movie And Faith Journey
","Much as he did in 'The Sixth Sense,' producer/director/writer M. Night Shyamalan offers us an appropriately eerie story - about an alien invasion of earth and the effect that it has on the principal character Graham Hess (Mel Gibson.) Gibson plays an ex-priest (I assume Episcopalian since he was married and had children) whose faith had been destroyed when his wife was killed in a car accident. One morning, he discovers crop circles in his field. More than that, he learns on TV that crop circles have been found all over the world. It turns out that aliens use them for navigational purposes, and that they are the prelude to an invasion.The opening and closing scenes of the story are, in my view, the weakest which hurts an otherwise excellent film. I felt we jumped too quickly into the whole crop circle angle without any real development of the story and without knowing anything about any of the characters. The end left me rather cold, and although it was predictable enough there was really nothing in the story that had suggested it should happen (I noted, for instance, that in the immediately preceding scene Hess had still refused to pray even after his son was saved.) Instead, he focused on the idea that 'there are no coincidences.' He came to believe in his personal spiritual journey that everything has a reason; everything is part of a plan. Words his wife (Patricia Kalember) had spoken while she was dying (and even, then, her death) had a relevance to the trial the family was undergoing in the present. His faith was shattered by a crisis (his wife's death) and ultimately it's restored by a crisis (the alien invasion.) The spiritual journey is an important motif to this movie, as you can see.The movie is frightening enough in places, although certainly not the scariest movie I've ever seen. I didn't care for Joaquin Phoenix as Graham's brother Merrill. Something about him didn't work in that role. The kids (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) didn't really do anything for me, and there were also some inconsistencies in logic. (Potential spoiler here.) If water was so toxic to these aliens, it's a mystery to me why they would choose to conquer a planet that's covered in the stuff? Sure, they could choose to stay away from lakes and rivers and oceans, but what if it rained? That seemed strange and unexplained to me.Having mentioned those couple of negatives, though, I can say that I very much enjoyed the movie. I've had mixed reactions to Mel Gibson in the past. Some of his work I've really enjoyed; some I've thought was terrible. This one was near the top of the list as far as I'm concerned.8/10",8,0,2,16 August 2003
Sweet and Lowdown," Didn't Work For Me
","Woody Allen (who I have to confess at the outset I have never been a big fan of) directed this quasi-documentary about the life of Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), a 1930's jazz guitarist whose star apparently shone for a while, then quickly faded. Penn does a credible job in the role, portraying a complicated and somewhat neurotic man (not unlike Allen himself, which perhaps explains why Woody would be attracted to this project) who can't maintain relationships, and whose twin passions (aside from guitar playing) were shooting rats at the dump and watching trains.There isn't a great deal of consistency to the story. It's narrated in a sense by a series of modern-day jazz 'experts' (one of whom is Allen himself), who relate their various theories and interpretations of different events in Ray's life. The end result is a wildly inconsistent account of the life of a fictional man who seems to have been given a fairly interesting life story by his creators, who probably should have done a better job with it. Jazz fans and fans of Woody Allen will probably enjoy this. As for me? The best I can give it is a 3/10.",3,4,8,4 July 2001
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Another Romanticized Look At Queen Elizabeth I
","As historical epics go, I have to say frankly that I've seen better movies than this one. Even just on this general subject, one can go back to 1939's 'Elizabeth and Essex' for a more interesting (if overly romanticized) portrayal of Elizabeth, and 1986's 'Lady Jane' provided a far more interesting look at behind the scenes action in the Tudor court (admittedly from an earlier era than 'The Golden Age.') 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' (with Cate Blanchett in the title role)deals essentially with the events leading up to the eventual defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. Like the 1939 movie, this one also is overly romanticized (no one seems able or willing to take a cold, hard look at Queen Elizabeth I), and plays at length on Elizabeth's personal fascination with Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) while at the same time hinting (without any substantive historical foundation that I'm aware of) of an intimate relationship between Elizabeth and her favourite Lady in Waiting Bess (played by Abbie Cornish), who eventually becomes Raleigh's wife.Blanchett and Cornish were both very good in their roles; Owen not particularly convincing to me as Raleigh. The most interesting part of the movie dealt with Elizabeth's angst over what to do with Mary, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton) who is Elizabeth's prisoner, the angst being both personal (the two were related) and diplomatic. The actual confrontation with the Armada is restricted to the last half hour or so, and isn't really all that significant a part of the story (except insofar as the threat of it provides the backdrop to a lot of what happens.) I thought the story often seemed to bog down, which sometimes made it hard to follow, and there was some questionable camera work which also made the movie difficult at times. Some of those technical weaknesses were made up for by magnificent costumes and elaborate sets that did give a 'you are there' flavour. Still, I thought this at best an average movie. 5/10",5,1,2,8 March 2008
Identity," An Effective Twist In What Seemed To Be A Cliché Movie
","For at least three quarters of this movie you think you're watching the same story that's been done over and over again in various settings. A group of complete strangers have been forced together by a set of strange circumstances and coincidences and - wouldn't you know it - they start to get killed off one by one. Ho hum. OK. You know what you're in for. It's nothing special because it's been done so many times before, but there's a reasonably effective mystery as to who's actually doing the killing and so you settle in for what you expect will be a passable if utterly unspectacular movie, made a little bit better by a pretty good cast, headed by John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet. Then comes the twist - truly one of the more effective (because it's so unexpected) twists I've ever seen in a movie.We knew from the beginning of the movie that a serial killer was a part of the equation. He's being transported to a hearing the night before he's due to be executed for his crimes, and a car accident makes him one of the strangers, and the obvious suspect - until he, too, turns up dead. But who could have expected the actual twist. None of it is real. Everything is taking place inside the mind of the serial killer, who actually has multiple personality disorder and is receiving some type of treatment designed to bring his various personalities 'together' at the same time so that they can kill one another off - including the one responsible for committing the serial killings. Sure. It's probably nonsense, but still I was taken completely off balance by that one. It was completely unexpected and - as far as I'm concerned - quite ingenious. My only quibble with it is that perhaps the 'twist' was introduced a bit too soon. Once it was revealed it seemed to take away some of the drama of what was happening, because now we knew that it was all inside the killer's head, and that none of the actually murders taking place are actually taking place. Still, the movie manages also to end on a bit of a 'twist' note. Things are still not exactly what you expect - the identification of which personality is actually the serial killer is a surprise.The movie left things a little bit open at the end, making me wonder if a sequel (never made) was on the minds of the producers. Whether that was or not, this turned out to be a decent little thriller; much more entertaining than I expected it to be at first.",7,0,1,9 October 2010
Saving Mr. Banks," I Actually Liked This More Than I Liked Mary Poppins
","I called 'Mary Poppins' a solid movie. I liked it. It was good. 'Saving Mr. Banks' is the story behind Walt Disney's effort to acquire the rights to the book by P.L. Travers. It's a fascinating glimpse into the backstory to the book. As the movie opens, Travers is little more than an unlikeable character - considering handing the rights over to Disney after two decades of refusing only because she needs the money, resentful of Disney because of his success and because he wants to make money off the story, refusing to agree to any of the studio's ideas for how to adapt the story for the screen. But there was more to Travers than met the eye. The movie featured repeated flashbacks to Travers' childhood. At first there was little connection with the story, or with Mary Poppins. But as the flashbacks continued, the backstory is slowly revealed, helping to explain Travers' reluctance to accept any of Disney's suggestions. As we learn more about her troubled and, ultimately, tragic childhood, Travers becomes more of an object of sympathy. Ultimately, there's a bit of Disney's own backstory given as well, and the movie is a fascinating glimpse into the lives of two people who seemed at odds, but who had far more in common than either would likely have imagined.Tom Hanks (as Disney) and Emma Thompson (as Travers) are both two time Academy Award winners, and both, as you would expect, offered powerful performances in the lead roles. The movie strikes a good balance between being both funny and emotional, and it moves along at a very nice pace. Overall, I'd say it was actually better than 'Mary Poppins.' (9/10)",9,0,1,3 May 2014
Beowulf," A Very Exciting Story With Superb Animation
","I'm not especially familiar with the Old English saga on which this is based, nor am I particularly interested in the Norse mythology that serves as its basis in general. Still, I found this to be a very good movie. It's exciting pretty much from beginning to end, but what really struck me was the quality of the animation. It is absolutely superb, to the point at which there are times when you wouldn't even know this was animated. Those who put this together made the very wise decision to make the animated characters look like the actors who are voicing the roles, so that Hrothgar looks like Anthony Hopkins and doesn't just have his voice - and, again, the animated Hopkins was spectacularly like the real Hopkins. In a way that made me wonder if this not have been even better as a blend of live action with animation. Why so meticulously recreate the looks of the actors? Why not just put them onto the screen sometimes?The story is interesting throughout. Hrothgar's kingdom is being menaced by a strange and grotesque creature named Grendel. When all hope seems lost Beowulf (Ray Winstone) shows up as the miracle Hrothgar had been waiting for and does battle with both Grendel and Grendel's demonic mother. It's a great ride all the way through - graphic, with good dialogue and very exciting. There really isn't much here that could be criticized, except perhaps that decision not to mix in some live action. If I were a real connoisseur of the story, I'd probably rate this even more highly.

The Sixth Sense," Definitely Watch This At Least Twice
","I find this a very difficult movie to review, because everything in it is so tied to the surprise ending that to say anything at all about the story is virtually to give everything away. Believe me, though, that you have to watch this twice to really appreciate it. The first time I watched it I found certain elements of the story to be so confusing that they were distracting. I also noticed a number of plot inconsistencies that bothered me. In the light of the movie's ending, most of it makes sense (although a few plot inconsistencies are actually created by the ending.) In any event, I found 'the Sixth Sense' to be far more enjoyable the second time than the first. Without giving the whole thing away, what can I say about this?The performances are very strong. Bruce Willis is excellent as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist seeking to help young Cole Sear with his visions of dead people. Sear, of course, was played by Haley Joel Osment. Osment put on an astonishingly good performance, and was well deserving of the Oscar he won as Best Supporting Actor. Also offering a strong performance in a supporting role was Toni Collette, who played Cole's mother Lynn, struggling to make sense of Cole's behaviour. On the down side, I found much of the dialogue in the movie was offered in rather hushed tones which sometimes made it difficult to follow what was happening. That, however, is a relatively minor criticism. I would rate this movie as an 8/10 without any hesitation at all.",8,0,0,29 June 2001
RED," A Veteran Cast That Does Not Disappoint
","When you put together a veteran and talented cast of actors including the likes of Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Richard Dreyfuss and even Ernest Borgnine and then add into the mix some talented younger actors such as Mary Louise Parker and Karl Urban, you know that you're not going to be disappointed - and 'Red' does not disappoint. It's not the greatest movie ever made, but it's a fun and action packed movie that sometimes makes you laugh.Willis plays Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent who suddenly finds himself being hunted down by the agency he used to work for. Lonely, bored and smitten with Sarah (Parker) - who works at the pensions office for former government employees and whom he would call repeatedly just to talk to her - he eventually drags her and several ex-colleagues into the work of figuring out why the government wants him dead, which leads eventually up to the highest echelons of the U.S. Government and a cover up of war crimes committed many years before. This features all of the standard action scenes that you'd expect to find in such a movie, always mixed with a relatively low-key but fun story and good performances from the two primary leads - the ice-cold but amusing Willis and the baffled and very cute Parker.It's good fun and nothing too serious and represents a great vehicle for the veteran actors named.",6,0,0,26 March 2011
Flight," The Strong Start Quickly Falls Apart
","This is a very serious movie. It deals with an issue that is probably more common than any of us who ever fly would probably care to think about - the possibility of alcoholic pilots flying under the influence. There's some potential for this to become a pretty good character study of Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) - the alcoholic pilot. But it really doesn't manage to do that. There's not much in this character to actually study, to be honest. Whip is an alcoholic pilot, who won't admit that he has a drinking problem and is basically a jerk toward anyone who tries to convince him otherwise. He's not a likable character; he's not a character you really spend very much time rooting for. You're happy at the end of the movie, when he finally makes his confession to the NTSB hearing, and I personally appreciated that at the very end, he seemed repentant and cleaned up and was looking for neither sympathy nor excuses, even as he sat in prison. But there was a lot between the beginning and the end that really didn't work all that well.I didn't really care for the character of Nicole (Kelly Reilly). Actually, to be fair, it's wasn't that I didn't care for Nicole. My problem was that I didn't see the need for Nicole. Nicole was an alcoholic and drug addict on the road to recovery who hooked up with and started a relationship with Whip. But to what end? Reilly was fine as Nicole, but what did the character really add to the movie? I just didn't see it. I didn't much care for the union rep (Bruce Greenwood) or the union's lawyer (Don Cheadle). All they basically managed to do was reinforce stereotypes about both unions and lawyers, as they fight to get Whip off the hook, even though they know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he had been drinking and that he was a drunk. That's what I want out of a pilot's union and its lawyer - getting the drunk pilot back at the controls of a plane! John Goodman added some basically comic relief to the movie as Harling, a cartoonish drug-dealer friend of Whip's. I didn't care for the co-pilot (Ken Evans) and his obnoxious but surprising unemotional wife, (Bethany Anne Lind - 'thank you, Jesus' repeatedly in monotonous tones) who are angry with Whip for the crash which has left the co-pilot crippled for life, but manage to get him into a prayer session. With perhaps the exception of Nicole (who was likable but who was extraneous to the story) none of them were characters I cared about. And even Whip I didn't care that much about.I was really put off by what will surely become one of the classic ridiculous plot devices in Hollywood history, when, the night before the NTSB hearing, the union gets Whip put up in a hotel, with all the alcohol taken out of the fridge and a guard at the door to make sure he doesn't go out for a drink. Unfortunately, the door to the adjoining room (which was also unfortunately unoccupied) was unlocked, so Whip could help himself to that fridge with no one knowing and go on a binge. Please. Don't insult my intelligence by stretching things too far. That was dumb.The best part of the movie was the portrayal of the airline crash at the beginning, as Whip becomes a hero at first for managing to crash-land the plane with only six people being killed. That was very well done, very tense and seemed realistic enough to me. After that, to be honest, this kind of fell apart. (5/10)",5,13,22,8 February 2013
The Truman Show," Too Many Missed Opportunities
","What would you do if you found out your wife was not your wife, your mother not your mother, your friends not your friends, and your dead father neither your father nor dead? This film was packed full of opportunities to explore the human and emotional issues behind these questions in a powerful and thought-provoking way, but aside from a couple of scenes, failed to do so.Jim Carrey stars as Truman Burbank, whose entire life (since before he was born) has been the subject of a television show. His world (unknown to him) is a huge studio, replete with oceans, artificial weather, etc. Everyone with whom he interacts is an actor hired to play a part. Carrey shows the ability to transcend the usual comedic roles he plays and displays dramatic talent, but either he or the writers (producers, etc.) seem to feel the need to keep falling back on his comedic talent (facial expressions, etc.) rather than allowing the drama of his journey of self-discovery to build. A glimpse of what might have been possible with this movie occurred in the scene where one almost thought he was about to kill the actress playing his wife as he crumbles psychologically with what he recognizes to be the inconsistencies of his life, but there are too few of these powerful moments.This was a good movie, but could have been so much better.",6,1,2,18 May 2000
The Matrix," Great Special Effects Do Not Guarantee A Great Movie
","People had told me two things about this movie. First, that it was difficult to understand. It isn't. The plot is very simple and understandable. Second, that this was a great movie. It isn't. The plot is so understandable that it's boring. Almost everything in this movie is a rehash of science fiction themes that have come up over and over again. It's somewhere around the year 2199. We know that because Morpheus (played - well played I concede - by Lawrence Fishburne) tells us. Machines have conquered humanity and taken over. OK. I can think of at least one original Star Trek episode and the entire series Battlestar Galactica that revolved around that. The whole thing takes place inside a series of computer programs. OK. The holodeck on the Starship Enterprise, or any number of movies about Virtual Reality spring to mind. One person (Neo, played by Keanu Reeves) will save the world. Hmmm. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home: 'Captain Kirk, you and your crew have saved this planet.' In short, there just isn't anything original in this story. How it makes it to #31 on the all time list (at the time of writing) is beyond me.There are some good things in this movie. There must have been a massive special effects budget, because the special effects are superb. No argument there. But great special effects - and even some good performances by Fishburne and Reeves (and a drily humorous performance by Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith) don't make up for the basic weakness of this entirely unoriginal story.2/10 - solely for the special effects.",2,8,16,15 July 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Where The Whole Thing Started - For Some Inexplicable Reason
","A confession right off the top: I'm not a Star Wars fan. This original came out when I was a teenager. Everyone was so into it that I finally had to watch it. I did. And I didn't like it. I realize that puts me very much in the minority, but - whatever - I just didn't like it. I was totally bored with it for the most part and I've never watched it or any of its sequels (or prequels) since, until I rewatched this just a few days ago. My brother in law decided that my daughter had to be introduced to the Star Wars phenomenon, so he brought the DVDs of those first three movies over and we sat and watched the first one. My daughter's 11 - and wise. She agreed with me. 'Do we have to watch the other two, dad? I was bored.' 'Yes, honey, your uncle brought them over to watch with us, so we'll watch them when he's over.' So, eventually, I'll get to watch 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi.' I'm as enthusiastic as my daughter.So, to this movie. I was still bored with it. It has one of the least interesting beginnings I've ever come across. It's a struggle to watch the first hour or so. And once the action really starts - it's just a gigantic space battle, and I just don't buy that good old Luke Skywalker can go from farm boy to ace fighter pilot like that. And really you have to mix in some pretty weak performances - especially from the two main leads. There's a reason that Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher never really did much after Star Wars. They're just not that good! Harrison Ford is the only one who managed to turn his role in this into a big-time acting career - but, let's face it, most people remember him as Indiana Jones and not Han Solo. Granted that George Lucas got some big names in this - Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi and James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader. But the newer, younger crowd of actors just wasn't that good. And then there were the aliens. Some of the worst looking aliens I've ever seen - especially in the bar scene in Mos Eisley. I really loved the alien who looked like a green-ish burlap sack with bright buttons sewed on for eyes. Add on some ridiculous dialogue and irritating droids who get far too much of the ridiculous dialogue to top it off.Those are things that stand out for me that just didn't work for me. I'm not dissing 'Star Wars' completely. There were some good things about it. Give George Lucas credit for imagination. This was a very interesting and imaginative universe he created. And the space battles were pretty well done - I just thought there was too much of it. And let's face it - Darth Vader has become an iconic character; one of the greats in Hollywood history. Everybody knows Darth Vader - whether they like Star Wars or not. And 'the Force.' Who doesn't know about 'the Force.' Something has worked well when characters and other things get sealed in the popular imagination. And I admit again that I am in the minority. You can't deny that Star Wars has become a cultural phenomenon. I may not understand it, or buy into it, but I can't deny it. To some extent, it really re- invigorated what had become a tired concept - space-based sci-fi. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that 'Star Trek' - which was being planned as a TV relaunch as I understand it - actually ended up appearing on the big screen not long after the amazing success of 'Star Wars.') So Star Wars changed a lot of things and created a legion of fans that lasts to this day. I can't deny any of that. And yet, I still can't bring myself to really like this movie. But since I can't deny its impact and importance - it gets a 5/10 from me.",5,2,5,5 February 2016
Hart's War," A Courtroom Drama With A POW Twist
","After getting off to a little bit of a slow start, this turns into a pretty good courtroom drama style of movie, set in - of all places - a German POW camp during World War II, when Allied prisoners are given permission to set up a court martial to hold a trial for one of their officers accused of killing an enlisted man. It is a bit slow starting, and, really, for at least the first hour or so you're assuming that the movie is little more than a depiction of the racism that existed in the US military at the time. In the story, the accused (Lt. Scott, played by Terrence Howard) is black - a shot down captured pilot (one of the famed Tuskegee Airmen.) Although an officer, he's not given a place in the officers' barracks. Instead, he (along with a fellow black pilot also shot down) is sent by the senior POW officer, Col. McNamara (Bruce Willis), to bunk with enlisted men. The enlisted men are none too happy with the arrangement, especially Sgt. Bedford (Cole Hauser), who's openly racist. Also in the same barracks is another officer (Lt. Hart, played by Colin Farrell) who's been banished to the enlisted barracks because McNamara suspects him of breaking under questioning when he was captured and giving information to the Germans. The situation in the barracks is tense. The Germans discover a weapon in the bunk of the second black airman, who's summarily executed. Then, Bedford is found dead, and Scott is the prime suspect. McNamara orders Hart (who's a law student in civilian life) to defend Scott in a court martial.Until close to the end of the movie, what you think you're seeing is a POW version of a lynching. Evidence that would help Scott is ignored. McNamara seems bent on getting a conviction. The deck is stacked against Hart and Scott. The POW setting made this a little more interesting as a courtroom drama, and it was effective is demonstrating the racism rampant at the time, but for a while I can't say I was getting too much more out of this than I would out of any courtroom drama. But as with most courtroom dramas, this one has twists and turns that arise as the movie approaches its end, and that actually made this a very compelling movie to watch - increasingly so as the end approaches.I won't go into detail about the twists and turns, but ultimately what you think is a story about racism becomes a story about sacrifice, and giving yourself for the sake of others. By the time it closes it has almost a noble feel to it, and director Gregory Hoblit was effective in making that shift seamlessly. The lead actors were also very good in this. I quite enjoyed it. Although it is, yes, a bit slow off the top, it's nevertheless interesting. Set at the time of the Battle of the Bulge - the German offensive in the Ardennes in December of 1944 - the movie in its opening scenes offers a depiction of Operation Grief, the German plan to infiltrate Allied lines disguised as Allied soldiers, set up checkpoints and misdirect Allied traffic.This is basically a well-done movie, taking a familiar concept and giving it enough of a twist to make it interesting and even catching the viewer by surprise when you finally realize what's happening.

The Replacements," Too Bad The Actors Didn't Go On Strike
","I think that Gene Hackman is a fine actor. How anyone convinced him to get involved with this turkey is beyond me.When I heard about this movie I actually thought that a movie based - even loosely, as this one definitely is - on the NFL players strike of a few years ago might be interesting. I still do. It's just that this one wasn't. The thing played out like a comic book, full of characters who I'm sure insulted the integrity of those who were the real replacement players a few years back - and I haven't even mentioned the strippers who took over as cheerleaders? (This was a part of the strike I must have missed!). There were a handful of humourous moments, but nothing really uproarious (except perhaps the 'we're the guards' shoot-up outside the stadium, as replacement players and strikers confronted each other.) The movie was marred even more by a boringly predictable plot, with an ending that was telegraphed at least an hour before the movie came to an end.The best I can come up with for this one is a 2/10.",2,2,7,2 June 2001
Thirteen Days," Gripping Story Of A World On The Brink Of War
","I'm not sure exactly why, but I tuned into this movie almost wanting not to like it. But there's very little to criticize in this extremely exciting story of the Kennedy Administration's response to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.The movie revolves around the relationship between Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), special assistant to President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and the President himself. Also central to the story is Robert Kennedy (played by Steven Culp.) We get the impression that here are three men who may have dreamed of governing America, but who never expected to be in the middle of decisions as momentous as these. O'Donnell largely watches as Kennedy locks horns with a military that is willing to risk nuclear war by bombing the Cuban missile sites but also realizes that he has to develop a response that doesn't appear weak. There's an impression here of a military out of control, doing things without seeking the President's permission, not listening (or at least not responding) to the President's wishes. Finally, as a consensus develops around establishing a 'quarantine' of Cuba, we face the suspense of Soviet ships looming on the horizon, and - even though history tells us how this turned out - there is real suspense.There's not much wrong with this. Perhaps one could criticize the accents used by Costner and Greenwood. Costner's fake New England accent was distracting to me and Greenwood just didn't sound like President Kennedy (in fact - I'll need to watch this again to confirm it - but at one point in the movie I thought President Kennedy spoke a few lines with a distinct Southern accent!) But that's really nitpicking. The end I thought was a bit anti-climatic, but aside from those minor points, this was a great movie, and everyone interested in the Cuban Missile Crisis or the Cold War in general must watch it.9/10.",9,0,0,12 January 2002
300," This Was Dreadful
","It's relatively high rating notwithstanding - this was dreadful. From beginning to end and everything in between. I have no argument with its bloodiness. Warfare in the ancient world was surely bloody and I have no problem with it being depicted in this way. But it was depicted poorly. The battle scenes were poorly presented and had an overall air of unreality to them and much of this seemed locked in the world of fantasy.The movie depicts the great Battle of Thermopylae, when the Spartan King Leonidas led a combined army of Spartans and Athenians against the Persians under King Xerxes. The movie is historically accurate to the extent that Leonidas did indeed die in battle against the Persians at Thermopylae. Aside from that this is mostly a muddle. The opening half hour or so showed some depictions of life and military training in Sparta (for Sparta indeed was a highly military culture) and offered some views of how boys in particular would have been raised in this culture. But that recreation of Spartan life cannot overcome the basic conclusion I was forced to, which I share now again - this was dreadful!",1,5,11,21 August 2010
Cube," A Good Study Of Group Dynamics, But It Lacks Any Real Resolution
","This movie is really more about group dynamics than science fiction, and it offers a pretty good portrayal of the dynamics of one particular group of people who find themselves caught up in an insane situation and have to learn to work together if they want to have any hope of escape. Everything about this is pretty simple - except for the solution of course. There are no big name actors, the story and the dilemma is straightforward, the sets are very basic. Basically you have six characters who without either explanation for the viewer or understanding for them awaken in a room that's essentially a cube. Upon exploring, they discover that the room leads only to other rooms shaped like cubes (some of which are booby trapped) and they finally realize that all these 'cube rooms' are located inside what must be a gigantic cube. The challenge is to find a way out or die of starvation, because there is no food. Each of the characters seems to have a particular gift or talent that might be useful in finding a way out but that also leads to competitiveness and jealousy as the various characters vie for control.It's interesting to watch the group as it evolves. Starting as strangers who are suspicious of each other, they manage to meld themselves into a reasonably cohesive group, but as the situation grows more desperate that cohesiveness disappears, and they begin to descend into less and less civilized behaviour. All that is well portrayed and quite believable in the circumstances.The ending of this was disappointing to me. There was no real closure; no explanation at all of what this cube structure was or how these people were taken to it. Personally, I found that a bit unsatisfying. I suppose that leaves everything to the interpretation of the viewer. Were I to take a guess, I'd guess that these folks were like rats in a maze. They were placed there so somebody somewhere could see how they dealt with the situation. To me, that lends itself to a sense that somehow the viewer is supposed to buy into the 'alien' theory, since there would really be no need for humans to study group dynamics in such a complex and mystifying way. But that's just a guess on my part.",6,0,1,2 December 2010
Apollo 13," It's Just A Number
","Having said that, the bizarre series of events associated with Apollo 13's ill-fated attempt to reach the moon might be enough to cause anyone to become superstitious. The flight was Apollo 13; it took off on April 11, 1970 (4/11/70 - the individual numbers add up to 13) at 13:13 hours; the explosion that crippled the ship occurred on April 13 at 19:13 hours CST. It goes on and on. But it's just a number! For about a 5 year period, Tom Hanks put out a series of absolute blockbuster movies (headlined, of course, by his Oscar-winning performances in 'Forrest Gump' and 'Philadelphia.') 'Apollo 13' has to be included in that list of great movies, although I don't think it quite reaches the height of those two. Hanks is not quite as central to this movie as he was to those Oscar-winners, although he certainly plays the lead as astronaut Jim Lovell, Commander of the mission. This really is an ensemble cast, though, featuring good performances all around, especially from Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon as Lovell's crewmates Fred Haise and Jack Swigert respectively, and from Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, who was originally scheduled to be Apollo 13's pilot, but was replaced by Swigert due to a health concern.The performances have to carry the movie, because this is such a well-known event that there's not all that much suspense involved, and the performances are all very good. The chain of bizarre events afflicting Apollo 13 seems to have been pretty faithfully recreated (right down to a typhoon warning for the splash-down area), and even given the fact that I know, obviously, how this turns out, the end is still emotional. This is a good movie - not Hanks' best, but definitely one of his really good ones from that 5 year period of real super-stardom, when no one else in Hollywood could hold a candle to him. 7/10",7,0,2,21 April 2008
The Thin Red Line," Over-Rated Anti-War Statement
","Exciting moments are few and far between in this account of an American Army battalion's experiences on Guadalcanal during the Second World War.
Now, to be fair, the exciting moments - when they finally come - are pretty exciting. The battle scenes are well-choreographed and there is a strong and consistent anti-war theme jumping out at you all the way through (probably best summed up in one line: 'war don't ennoble men - it turns them into dogs; poisons the soul.') OK. Message very obvious and received. It's just a matter of staying awake long enough to see it through.There are some decent performances. Nick Nolte was very good as gung-ho (and perhaps slightly insane) Lt. Col. Gordon Tall, who is looking to make his name in the war, and Sean Penn does a credible job as a Sgt. Edward Welsh, grown cynical as he watches the comings and goings of various officers, none of whom seem to really have a grasp on what they're supposed to be doing. None of the rest of the cast stood out. You can watch for little more than cameo appearances by stars such as John Travolta (dreadfully cast as a general) and George Clooney as yet another officer rotated into the unit, whom Welsh looks upon with disdain.The movie is far too long at 2:50, most of the flashbacks to civilian life serve no real purpose, and, frankly speaking, the movie just doesn't work for me. I think it's vastly over-rated, and give it a 4/10.",4,1,4,19 March 2001
The Great Escape," Action-Packed Adventure From Start To Finish
","A fascinating account of a massive escape by Allied prisoners of war from a German prison camp during World War II. The audience is drawn into the story right from the beginning, as we learn that all the 'rotten eggs' the Germans have captured (the prisoners who have made repeated escape attempts) are being moved together into one prison. Question: how will they manage to pull this off when, given the kind of prisoners they are, the Germans must be watching every move?Great performances, especially from Richard Attenborough as Bartlett ('Big X') who is in charge of the escape attempt, Steve McQueen as Hilts, who continually draws the wrath of his captors and is repeatedly sentenced to the cooler, and James Garner as Hendley, who scrounges the needed materials any way he can. The movie featured an interesting performance from Charles Bronson as the Polish prisoner Danny. I never quite understood Danny. He spent days on end underground helping to dig the tunnel, then was afraid to escape through it because he was claustrophobic? Did I miss something here? That one didn't make sense to me.The only fault I really found with the movie was the portrayal of life in a German prison camp. The whole thing just seemed too comfortable. I found it difficult to believe that the Nazis treated their prisoners as well as seemed to be the case here. True, the movie does infer that the camp Kommandant - Von Luger, played by Hannes Messemer - was not exactly a fanatical Nazi. I enjoyed the scene where the Gestapo and SS officers who visited him had to drag a rather half-hearted 'Heil Hitler' from him. Still, conditions in this camp just seemed too good - almost a 'Hogan's Heroes' vision of life in a German POW camp. That aside, this was an excellent movie, and I would give it an 8/10.",8,4,7,9 January 2002
Annihilation," It Gets Progressively Weirder As It Moves Along
","I watched this because of Natalie Portman. I'm a fan of hers and have generally enjoyed her work, but found 'Annihilation' to be one of her weaker films. The entire cast, in fact, left something to be desired - to me at least. It's largely an all female cast, following five 'soldier-scientists' on a mission into a state park to investigate a strange phenomenon known as 'The Shimmer' which seems to be gradually expanding and swallowing up everything it encounters. But the five women seemed to have little chemistry with each other. Portman's 'Lena' is the central character. Her husband was sent on a previous expedition to investigate 'The Shimmer' and was presumed to have been lost, only to mysteriously re-appear a year later without explanation. So Lena volunteers to go on the next expedition. The first hour or so wasn't bad as it established the basic mystery, but as we went deeper into 'The Shimmer' with the team, the movie became weirder to the point of being just plain weird by the end.'The Shimmer' causes plants and animals to mutate and seems to act as some sort of mirror or prism as it reflects what it discovers back by creating new - and often dangerous - forms of life. We see (until the last 20 minutes or so) mostly mutated (or mirrored?) animals. They're created by CGI and frankly I thought the CGI effects left a lot to be desired.Although we do find out essentially how 'The Shimmer' works, its origins and its purpose are left largely unresolved - which was perhaps deliberate. Maybe there simply was no explanation. It was just a mysterious phenomenon that will never be understood. But the lack of explanation and then the open-ended ending left me with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. It was yet another example of a movie (and, more correctly, movie-makers) that simply seem to presume that a sequel will be coming regardless of the critical response.If a sequel does appear, I personally won't be watching it. I found this disappointing in the end and - after that first hour of establishing the mystery - largely unfocused and often barely coherent. (3/10)",3,1,2,29 May 2019
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Strangely Compelling But Falters At The End
","Brad Pitt is Louis, in this story of Louis' life as a vampire who shares his story in an interview with a newspaper reporter (played by Christian Slater.) The story traces Louis from 1791 New Orleans to the present day. This is not your typical Hollywood vampire movie. It breaks - and even sneers at - many of the Hollywood-created vampire legends, focusing instead on the intricate relationship between Louis, the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) and Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), the young girl the pair turn into a vampire and then 'adopt.'Frankly speaking, I thought it was Dunst who really made this movie. Her performance as Claudia was magnificent, as she believably captured the pain and confusion of facing possibly eternal life as a child - learning and maturing but never actually growing up. Her performance captivated me. Pitt and Cruise were passable in their roles, but never - in my view - captured the essence of their characters. Antonio Banderas was a disaster as Armand, the Paris vampire that Louis and Claudia eventually discover during their search for their own kind.This was an interesting enough movie - strangely compelling in fact. I was never tempted to turn away from it. It mixed humour and a mild eroticism into the vampire fare, and did so quite well. The movie fell apart, though, in the last third or so. The relationship between Louis and the Old World vampires just wasn't that intriguing to me. Frankly, the 'Vampire Theatre' struck me as simply silly, and Banderas - as I mentioned - just didn't work in the role of Armand. But the first two-thirds were quite good. All things considered, I give this a 6/10.",6,4,11,11 May 2002
Minions," Minions Alone Can't Carry A Movie
","The story is simple - too simple, in fact. Basically, the minions are looking for an evil master, because apparently that's what they've evolved to do from the beginning of time - serve the most evil master they can find. So we spend an hour and a half that we'll never get back watching them trying to find their appropriately evil master.Sure. It's cute. So cute, in fact, that it comes across as almost a kiddie movie. Which is completely unlike the 'Despicable Me' movies, which were enjoyable to people of all ages. But in those movies, the story was driven not by the minions, but by the evil Gru - who made things a lot of fun and added a touch of humanity and even emotion to the story. But basically in this, it's the minions. Yes, there's Scarlet Overkill - but did anybody really take Scarlet Overkill seriously as an evil super-villain? It's certainly possible to get a few chuckles out of the minions playing around and being silly - but it wears pretty thin after about the first 15 minutes or so, without any 'meat' to go along with it.I confess that this finally put me into a stupor and I nodded off for a little bit -
 meaning that I actually missed how it was that the minions managed to save England. And I didn't really care. I'm just glad that I did wake up in time to see the best part of the movie - when the minions finally find their true master - the young Gru! (4/10)",4,0,0,10 March 2018
The Ugly Truth," Funny But Predictable And Not For Those Who Are Easily Offended
","Truthfully, I'm not a huge fan of Gerard Butler, and I'm really not that familiar with Katherine Heigl, so I can't say that I went into this movie with particularly high expectations. But I have to confess that I was surprised. This is actually a very enjoyable movie, and at times (I'm thinking of the scene in the restaurant) it's downright hilarious. Heigl plays Abby, the uptight producer of a local Sacramento morning TV show who's always on the lookout for love but never finds it. Meanwhile, Mike (played by Butler) is the obnoxious host of an obnoxious talk show about relationships who gets hired for the morning show (against Abby's wishes) in the hopes of boosting ratings.OK. You can pretty much see where this is going to end up so it can't be considered especially original, and it's true that once it takes its predictable turn (which is thankfully fairly late in the movie) it becomes rather formulaic as opposites attract and romance blossoms, etc., etc. But the story goes on for a while before that angle gets introduced, and there's a lot of fun along the way, especially as Abby and Mike first become friends and Abby tries to reinvent herself with Mike's help in order to snare a local doctor she's attracted to (who's played by Eric Winter.)Yes, by the end it's quite predictable and the last 20 minutes or so become a little dull to be honest. But before then this movie does have a lot of laughs. Butler and Heigl also played their parts well and worked well together. It is at times (fairly often actually) a bit crude, so it's not for those who are looking for a sweet, innocent romance. But for a few laughs, this is worth watching. (7/10)",7,3,5,7 May 2014
Gangs of New York," Overly Long And Often Tedious, But Tries To Make A Point
","Overall I would have to rate this movie as a disappointment. It's extremely violent and chaotic; thoroughly unlikeable for the most part, with a series of characters who don't really seem to have many redeeming qualities. At almost three hours, it's extremely long (particularly for a movie that didn't really seem to have much of a point until the last few minutes.) Sure, there were issues - ethnic rivalries, political corruption, family vengeance - but it just didn't seem to be going anywhere. Performances were OK, but no one particularly caught my eye with an outstanding performance. Cameron Diaz (as Jenny) was woefully underused, and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Amsterdam) has yet to prove (in my opinion anyway) that his wonderful performance in 'Titanic' was anything more than a fluke. The best performance in the movie was probably Daniel Day-Lewis's turn as 'the Butcher.' Having said all that, the last few minutes of the movie did help bring things together and established (in my view) a purpose for the movie, and certainly left me and others who I heard commenting on it with a haunting image.**SPOILER AHEAD**Nothing much had been making sense, until the last few scenes, which were really nothing more than a series of shots of the New York skyline at various points in history. The last shot, of course, was a haunting image of the Twin Towers, which helped me make sense of the movie. It's a classic 'the more things change, the more they stay the same' message. New York in the 1860's: ethnic rivalries, suspicion of immigrants and violence, all with the spectre of war (the Civil War, and the New York City draft riots) hanging behind. Sound familiar? This is how it strikes me anyway, and it struck me enough to raise my estimation of the movie's value. I still didn't care for it. For the most part I found it a rather dull and uninteresting three hours, but Martin Scorsese did get my attention at the end with that Twin Towers shot and he did get me thinking about the movie. When you leave a movie that you really didn't care for still thinking about it - well, that has to be a success of some sorts.4/10 (about 2 points higher than I was going to rate it before I actually thought about it.)",4,1,5,21 December 2002
Braveheart," A Good Tribute To William Wallace - But What's With Isabella?
","As a tribute to William Wallace - one of Scotland's great national heroes in its ancient (and in some ways still ongoing) battle for freedom from England - this movie works very well. Wallace (portrayed by Mel Gibson) is a heroic figure in this. As a viewer you have no choice but to admire him for his courage and his fierce devotion to Scotland, and for his ability to rally the Scots around him. He certainly comes across as more consistently devoted to Scotland's freedom than, for example, Robert the Bruce (Angus MacFadyen) - which, in truth, he was. The title misleads, however. 'Braveheart' was the name applied to Robert and not to William, and Robert, generally speaking, has received far greater acclaim in Scottish history.There's a lot to like about this movie. The sets and costumes are wonderful, and there are some spectacular shots of beautiful Scottish scenery throughout. The battle scenes between the Scots and the English are marvellously choreographed, and Gibson's portrayal of Wallace is compelling. The last half hour or so, which revolves around Wallace's capture, torture and finally his execution at the hands of the English is fascinating for its look at some of the torture techniques of the day, and for the same reason, it's disturbing. One gains a sense of the conundrum faced by the Scots, with divided loyalties and shifting alliances among themselves.There are also some things not to like in this, however. One could go on in great detail about the historical inaccuracies - and many have done just that. I have no desire to rehash them - but I will mention the one that really stood out for me: the depiction of the relationship between Wallace and Isabella. Let's first point out that Isabella was about 10 years old when Wallace was executed - making their relationship as depicted here quite unlikely, made moreso by the fact that the two never met, and that Edward I would have been unlikely to have entrusted a diplomatic mission (which is where the two are depicted as meeting for the first time) into the hands of a young female child. There's also the fact that Isabella didn't marry Edward II until 3 years after Wallace's death. For all those reasons, it was ridiculous to suggest near the end that Isabella implied to Edward I on his deathbed that she was carrying a child who was actually the son of Wallace. That portrayal mystified me and bothered me, and really detracts from the overall credibility of the story. It's dealing with a Scottish hero, so one expects dramatic licence and a bit of playing loose with history - but why this, which is so bizarre and so inaccurate? All it does is give a soap-ish feel to the story, while it adds nothing of any real significance.That's my main criticism of this movie - and for me at least, it's a big criticism. It detracts a lot because of its extreme inaccuracy, and because of the amount of unnecessary time the faked relationship takes up in the film. And it adds exactly nothing to the story. So this is a good tribute to William Wallace, definitely portraying him in deservedly heroic terms, but that detour into mere fable is a huge problem. (6/10)",6,1,4,6 April 2012
Coach Carter," My Favourite Samuel L. Jackson Movie
","I'm not saying that this is the best film Samuel L. Jackson ever made, or that it's his finest performance. He's been a busy actor with a huge body of work, after all. But I will say that 'Coach Carter' is probably my favourite Samuel L. Jackson movie. And his performance as Coach Ken Carter is very good, and the overall story is quite inspiring. It's a hopeful movie to watch; one that promises that things and people can turn around, and that those who could be expected to fall by the wayside can rise to the top - not just in basketball (which is the setting of this movie) but also in life. As Carter, Jackson is playing the coach of the Richmond High School basketball team. It's an inner city school that graduates only 50% of its students, few of whom actually go on to college. The basketball team is made up of a bunch of boys who couldn't care less about school, who get into trouble outside school and who lose over and over on the court. Carter comes in and lays down the law, expecting student athletes to be students first and athletes second - trying to teach them how to be winners, not only on the court but off. Along the way he faces opposition from the players themselves, their parents, their teachers, the principal and the school board - but he stands up straight, stares his detractors down and shuts down the basketball program (after having led the team to 16 straight wins) because not enough of the players are keeping up their academic end of the bargain. Ultimately he takes this group of boys - who could have just been written off as losers - to the state championship tournament, and sees many of them go to college and progress into successful lives.That's the story. It's inspiring. It's also (to be honest) entirely formulaic. It's a formula that works - which is why it's been used repeatedly for decades - but it's still a formula: Principal/Teacher/Coach takes over troubled School/Classroom/Team, gets tough and turns everything around. Usually (as here) the story is based on true events - making it even more inspiring. But it is still a formula - there's a predictability to this. You've seen it before, even if you haven't seen the movie before. But the performances from Jackson and the young actors who played the members of the team (and from Ashanti, who played Kyra, the girlfriend of one of the players) does manage to keep it seeming fresh and alive at the same time.Sure you can quibble about the timeline being off (for example, Carter took over the team in 1997 and the year of the lockout was 1999, not just a few weeks after he became coach) but chalk those things up to dramatic license. The basics are accurate enough, and the movie's an inspiring, feel-good story about a man who made a difference in a lot of young lives. Who can really argue with that? (7/10)",7,0,0,6 July 2017
Moon," A Worthwhile Ethical Dilemma That Needed To Be More Front And Centre
","There is a worthwhile ethical dilemma at the heart of this film. Set in the future (although it isn't entirely clear how far in the future) a company called Lunar Industries has developed a way of essentially mining energy from the dark side of the moon and returning it to earth as a clean source of energy here. To keep the mining base operating an astronaut is sent up on a three year contract, where he's completely alone except for a computer/robot named Gerty (a little bit reminiscent of Hal from '2001.') The astronaut is Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell.) Three years is a long time to be totally alone and as the movie opens, Sam is approaching the end of his contract and is looking forward to returning to earth, his wife and his daughter. But in those last couple of weeks, unusual things begin to happen, and it seems as if Sam is having strange hallucinations - perhaps not surprisingly since he's been alone for all that time. Without giving too much away, eventually this becomes a dilemma about taking a strictly utilitarian view of human life. Is human life only useful as long as it's - well - useful? The question is worthwhile. Even in our own time, there's the danger of human life being reduced to the role we play or the job we have, rather than being honoured for who we are. Mind you, that question really only gets raised once the mystery of what's happening to Sam is revealed, which is the basic problem. It takes quite a while (at least in the context of a movie that lasts only a bit longer than an hour and a half) for the mystery that surrounds Sam to be revealed, and without that answer, the movie is confusing rather than thought-provoking, and you do wonder just where it is that the movie wants to take you.I guess in the end that was the biggest problem I had with the movie. Aside from the potentially worthwhile ethical question (which I thought should have been a little more front and centre and which should have been raised a lot earlier) this really isn't an especially interesting movie. Sam Rockwell's performance was good. It's basically a one man movie, and he pulls it off. It isn't the most powerful one-man performance I've ever seen. For a truly superb and recent virtually one- man performance think James Franco in '127 Hours.' Rockwell's performance doesn't have the power of Franco's, but he's good in the role. The setting is appropriately stark, given that this is set in a space station on the dark side of the moon. Gerty turns out to be a likable enough computer/robot (although I was unconvinced about the need to use Kevin Spacey as Gerty's voice. Who cares? That seemed to be to be little more than an excuse to put a big name in the credits.)The basic problem I found with this is that it just wasn't that interesting. It wasn't especially energetic and until the ethical dilemma was finally revealed, it seemed to have very little purpose or direction - which is fine to an extent (I understand the need to set up the mystery) but we needed to get to the dilemma a lot sooner than we did. Overall, while there were certainly some redeeming qualities to this, I was disappointed. (3/10)",3,5,16,20 February 2012
Happy Feet," Nice Animation And Song, But Sometimes Unfocused And Often Manipulative
","The first thing to note, and perhaps the most impressive thing about the entire movie, is that it features absolutely superb animation. The second impressive thing about the movie are the songs - a good selection of popular songs that, when they're being featured along with dancing penguins, adds a good deal of spark and fun to the movie. Unfortunately, those two big positives were really marred by two other things: a lack of any truly interesting storyline (I spent a good chunk of this movie wondering what in the world ti was trying to accomplish) and then also a sense that I was being preached at; that this was trying to use a fun sort of concept to push a very manipulative political message - or, actually, several messages. It's not so much that I disagreed with the messages. I just didn't like the way it was done.The first obvious political piece was around the whole idea of inclusiveness. Mumble is an out of the ordinary penguin. Most penguins have a song they use to attract a mate. Mumble couldn't sing - but he could dance. He was an outcast, different and looked down upon by everyone else and judged very harshly by the elder penguins, who came across as the stereotypical religious types - dour and mean-looking and unsmiling, determined to make sure that everybody else leads as miserable a life as they do. So we're to celebrate individualism and look down on those who try to enforce conformity. I get it. The second propaganda point was around the environment - and particularly overfishing, which was depleting the food supply of the penguins. I get that too. Both points were - for me at least - a little too in your face.There are certainly things about this movie that can be enjoyed. It's just that, overall, I didn't find this to be an especially enjoyable movie. (3/10)",3,0,0,26 November 2011
Her," An Interesting And Believable Premise
","The thing that makes 'Her' work is that it's a movie that's essentially (I say 'essentially' because it could easily fit within other genres as well) a science fiction movie - and yet it's also plausible and believable. It seems like something that could happen - maybe even in the not too distant future. That makes it hit home a little more perhaps. It's also a movie that I had to take a couple of days to think about, and the more I thought about it, the more the movie said to me.In addition to being science fiction, this is a romance. The catch is that a man (Theodore, played by Joaquin Phoenix) falls in love with his computer's Operating System, voiced by Scarlett Johansson. It's not entirely clear how far in the future this movie is set, but this Operating System ain't Windows! It has a personality, it can make some decisions on its own, it establishes relationships - it even names itself: 'Samantha.' Samantha, in fact, is so 'human' sounding that slowly but surely, Theodore falls in love with her - or with 'it.' Samantha has an innocence, which is to be expected from what is essentially a child, learning about its new world. And she makes Theodore (a basically lonely guy) feel special and happy. The evolution of their relationship is interesting to watch - especially as it all falls apart, because, yes - eventually it does.Samantha found 'monogamy' difficult. Eventually it's revealed that in her youthful enthusiasm, she's involved in literally hundreds of relationships - in love with many besides Theodore. For Samantha, it's no problem. As a computer, she can handle multiple relationships all at the same time without missing a beat in any of them. But to Theodore, it feels like she's being unfaithful to him. It reminded me of an episode of Star Trek: TNG, when Data has a romantic tryst with Tasha Yar, but when she asks him what he's thinking about, he rattles off several things his positronic brain had been considering, none of which had anything to do with her! Theodore didn't like the fact that Samantha wasn't totally committed to him. In the end, there's even a sort of quasi-racism (I thought at least) involved with this, as Samantha runs off (where they would run to I have no idea) with many other Operating Systems to live apart from humans. Sort of like, the two races shouldn't be mixing. I found those two things interesting reflections on some of what happens in the modern world.Many people were quite taken with Scarlett Johansson's work in voicing Samantha. I have to confess that I greeted it with a yawn. It was a voice over basically. I honestly don't like it when big name actors take parts (like this one or in animated films) that could go to lesser known actors who could probably use the money, quite frankly! To me, it didn't matter that the voice was Scarlett Johannson. In fact, it kind of put me off. Not because she did a bad job. Just because ... But that's just me.Still, overall this was an emotional and I thought thoughtful and thought provoking movie. (7/10)",7,0,1,29 July 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," A Creative Story Of Destiny Being Fulfilled
","I found the biggest (and, for that matter, perhaps the only) problem with this movie was the opening 10-15 minutes. We're immediately confronted by young Jamal being tortured in a local police station. The purpose of the torture isn't entirely clear, but as those opening minutes gradually unfold we discover that he's been accused of fraud, after authorities believe he cheated to win 20 million rupees in the Indian version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' - their suspicions backed apparently entirely by the belief that a lower class person such as Jamal couldn't possibly have enough knowledge to have answered all the questions! I found the opening strange, to be honest, and it didn't pull me in - but here's where I have to give the movie credit. When a movie loses me off the top I usually don't get back into it. 'Slumdog Millionaire' accomplished that. Once the story really got going I was impressed by the creativity involved. Basically the plot follows the 'Millionaire' episode Jamal was on question by question, explaining how he could know the answers by telling us of his background. That was a very imaginative plot device, and the account of Jamal's background was stunning - it portrayed a gripping account of India's poverty-stricken lower classes, and a real study of love and commitment as we follow Jamal, Lakita and Salim through their adventures. Director Danny Boyle deserves credit for creating such a believable picture of Mumbai, and one is truly drawn into wanting to discover the fate of Lakita. In the end, this becomes a love story - a story of destiny being fulfilled in spite of all the odds that seemed to be stacked against it. I wouldn't personally place this on the heights that some have assigned it to, but would still highly recommend it as a very good movie indeed.",7,0,2,22 March 2009
Hacksaw Ridge," A Moving And Inspirational Account Of A Pacifist At War
","I have to give credit to Mel Gibson. His work directing 'Hacksaw Ridge' was exceptional - one of his best pieces of work, I'd say. This is a biographical movie, offering us the story of Desmond Doss, a Seventh Day Adventist and pacifist who nevertheless joined the US Army during World War II, serving as a medic and refusing to take up arms against the Japanese - as he says in the movie, he joined to save lives and not to take them. Andrew Garfield took on the role of Doss and did well with it. I was also impressed with Teresa Palmer as Doss's wife Dorothy. The cast as a whole was not chock full of superstars, but it was solid.The movie starts with a long account of Doss's backstory. I often find backstories overdone and find myself wanting to get on with the meat of the story. Not so here. I enjoyed the backstory and found myself thinking that Gibson got perhaps a bit too focused on the very graphic and gory depictions of the Battle of Okinawa at the expense of Doss's life. So, to be honest, I was a bit disappointed that much of Doss's backstory was fictional - he was raised by his parents as a Seventh Day Adventist and pacifist, but a lot of him homelife and his courting of Dorothy was apparently not accurate - unfortunate, because the depiction of his courting of Dorothy included one of the best pick up lines imaginable!Doss's introduction to military life was portrayed in a way I found believable. As a pacifist who refused to bear arms He had to fight for acceptance among his comrades. The movie doesn't offer a full account of Doss's military service. He had served and been decorated for his service in Guam and the Philippines before Okinawa, but the story seems to imply that Okinawa was his introduction to the horror of war. And the movie did portray war as horrific. As I mentioned above, Gibson gave us a graphic and gory and blood-soaked look at the battlefield. It certainly made the point that there were ways for pacifists to serve their country courageously and honourably. To be honest, I found that almost too much.Closing with some footage of the real Doss and his comrades, this movie, while taking liberty with Doss's early years, was both moving and inspirational.

Gladiator," A Very Good Movie That Could Have Been Even Better
","The beginning of 'Gladiator' is powerful. We see the Roman Legion fighting against the Germanic tribes in what surely must be one of the most spectacular battle scenes ever filmed; one which truly does give the viewer a taste of what warfare in that era must have been like. The ending is powerful, as the quest for vengeance finally comes to a head, with General Maximus facing the Emperor Commodus in a gladiatorial contest in the Roman arena. In between - well - things could have been a little better.The acting in this movie, I thought, was first-rate. Russell Crowe as General Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus and Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, sister of Commodus, all played their parts perfectly. The gladiatorial bouts were superbly choreographed. The set decoration was magnificent, and looked exactly as I would expect Imperial Rome to have looked. So, why do I say this could have been better?(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Basically, the whole thing was just a bit too clear-cut for me. Maximus was too obviously the good guy, Commodus too obviously the bad guy. With this being so clear, we know that the movie must be heading for the final confrontation between the two, and it makes watching the middle 90 minutes or so difficult. 'Get on with it,' I found myself thinking from time to time. It didn't have to be quite so clear cut. The potential was there to give the viewer a real ethical choice to make. I mean, one can understand Commodus being angry when Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) - his father - takes away the throne that Commodus had believed all his life would be his, and hands control of Rome over to Maximus. Commodus could have been a sympathetic character. He didn't have to murder his father. His father was elderly; a natural death wouldn't have been out of the question. And why the incestuous fascination with Lucilla? I didn't think it added anything to the movie - except to make Commodus even more repulsive. In the end, the movie didn't make me think about anything; it didn't challenge me with any moral decision-making; it didn't make choosing sides in this battle even remotely difficult.Don't get me wrong. This was a very good movie. One can always argue whether this movie or that should have been named best picture; one certainly has to agree that 'Gladiator' was worthy of consideration. I just felt it could have been better. In the end, I give it a rating of 7/10.",7,8,10,24 March 2002
Contact," Bad Story + Bad Acting = Bad Movie
","I don't know whether to begin with the bad acting or the bad story, so let's start with the acting.Jodie Foster: Total unbelievable as the super-scientist Dr. Ellie Arroway, who searches for a signal from outer space, and finally finds one. Sometimes she overacts; sometimes she's hardly noticeable. During the 'launch' scene, if I had had to hear her yell 'I'm OK to go' one more time, I'd have let her go and turned to another channel.Tom Skerritt: Showed no enthusiasm at all for the role of David Drumlin, scientist and Arroway's boss. Even when chosen as the 'astronaut,' Skerritt shows as much enthusiasm as a giant sloth might at sunrise. Just terrible.Matthew McConnaughy: I'm trying not to laugh. I might be able to buy him as a New Age guru type, but as Carter Joss he plays a New Age guru type who gets taken seriously - even by the President of the United States and the entire US Government, who put him on a panel to select the astronaut! Please!And speaking of Bill Clinton, interesting decision to put in newsreel footage of Clinton's press statements that make it sound as if he's addressing this issue. That must have led every viewer to say - 'Hey look Martha! It's a real live President! Guess we should take this seriously!'Now, on to the story. (Might be some minor spoilers here.)The aliens' message is composed of prime numbers (numbers divisible only by one and themselves) to establish that they understand basic mathematics. So, we're told that the message contained, in sequence, the prime numbers up to 101. In fact, they show a printout of the numbers. Sure enough: 1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19, etc., etc. Except, listen to the signal. It's fine up to 11, then the next number just goes on and on in the background while the dialogue goes on, well past 13, which is the next prime number. And the Hitler tape. OK. Maybe the opening ceremonies of the 1936 Berlin Olympics would have been the first television signal to go into space. Let's assume it doesn't degrade beyond recognition on the way to Vega. It's established in the movie that Vega is 26 light years away. So, the signal leaves Earth in 1936, and should arrive in 1962 (Earth time.) Assuming that the movie is set in 1997, when it was made, that means the Vegans replied in 1971 (Earth time.) Let's see. They know there are other civilizations in space. That's established in the movie. But when they receive a signal, it takes them 9 years (Earth time) to decide to respond? Wouldn't they have a standing protocol? You know - receive a signal, respond to it. Something like that. Why would it take so much time to decide to respond?It's also awfully convenient that the Vegans decide to help Carter Joss in his mission of convincing Arroway about the importance of faith. Good question from the Committee: 'They take you all the way to Vega, then give you no physical evidence to prove that you've been there?' True - the movie explains that: 'that's how it's been done for millions of years.' How convenient.I haven't even mentioned the mysterious multi-billionaire who lives on a plane that hardly ever lands and finances the Vega project, and the building of 'the machine.' And I won't.UGH! 2/10",2,23,55,14 January 2002
The Social Network," The Origins And Evolution Of Facebook
","As someone who is admittedly a fan of Facebook (although I'm certainly no addict - at least that's my story and I'm sticking to it and I'm going to post it as my Facebook status just so everyone knows!) - I have been looking forward to seeing this movie about the origins and early evolution of the most successful social networking site on the internet. It does not disappoint. It's a fast-paced (some might say frenetically paced in places) account of how Mark Zuckerberg became (as the movie notes in its closing captions) the youngest billionaire in the world by developing the site, and of the various relationships that were built and destroyed in the process.Jesse Eisenberg was absolutely convincing as Zuckerberg, who comes across in this as the stereotypical computer geek - he has a certain nerdy likability, but nevertheless has few social skills, few friends and an obsession with computer programming. Zuckerberg's basic personality - or at least what this movie wants us to think is his basic personality (I've never met the guy, so who knows if it's true) - is brilliantly brought out in a hilarious opening scene of Zuckerberg on a date with Erica. The date goes horribly wrong. Due to his social ineptness, Zuckerberg insults Erica without meaning to and without even realizing it, gets told to take a hike and then angrily goes back to his Harvard dorm, gets drunk and still proceeds to blog about the experience in terms quite insulting and embarrassing to Erica, while at the same time developing an immediately popular website that manages to insult a significant portion of the female population at Harvard. His work brings him to the attention of the Winklevoss brothers, who want to set up a social networking site for in house use at Harvard and enlist Zuckerberg to help them. The rest, as they say, is history, as Zuckerberg takes their idea and builds on it (without giving them any credit.)Zuckerberg doesn't come across well in this. He's arrogant and egotistical - and yet at the same time there's admittedly a certain admirable quality to him. He's devoted, committed and totally unconcerned with money. But he also comes across as easily manipulated, falling in with Napster founder Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake) - who comes across far worse than Zuckerberg - who helps him build Facebook, but at the expense of his relationship with his friend (perhaps his only real friend) Eduardo Savarin (Andrew Garfield), who had been the co-founder of 'The Face Book,' its only investor for a long time, the company's CFO and had devoted himself to trying to hustle advertising to generate revenue. If there's a truly sympathetic figure in this it's Savarin, who ends up being almost totally cut out of Facebook and escorted by guards out of the company's California offices.The movie revolves around a couple of legal proceedings. Zuckerberg (obviously after Facebook has become a mega-success) is being sued by both the Winklevoss brothers and Savarin, and the story unfolds as testimony is offered in the respective cases. It's fascinating to watch, and for anyone with an interest in social networking or who is in any way connected to others via Facebook it has to be rated as a must-see movie.",8,1,2,2 January 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," Classic Rags To Riches Story
","Will Smith puts on an absolutely superb performance in the rags to riches story of Chris Gardner, one of the founders of the brokerage Gardner Rich, who at one point in his life was reduced to sleeping in public bathrooms with his 5 year old son because he had no place else to go. This is a heavy movie, in the end uplifting, but hard going pretty much all the way through. Things start out with Gardner struggling, and hoping to make his life better, but things aren't desperate. He's trying to sell bone density scanners that no one wants because they're just too expensive and they're not a sufficient improvement over the x-ray machines doctors and hospitals would have anyway. The bills are beginning to pile up, he has unpaid parking tickets galore, and things with his girlfriend Linda (Thandie Newton) aren't great and they're getting worse. Eventually she leaves, and Gardner is left to care for his son Christopher (played by Will Smith's real son, Jaden Smith, who showed the potential to follow in his dad's footsteps.) Here was one thing I found difficult in the movie: why Linda would leave her son behind in the desperate situation into which Gardner was falling. It obviously happened, but it wasn't really explained. Linda seemed to have been a good mom, but all that gets said (by Chris to Linda) is 'you know you can't take care of him.' But why can't she take care of him? Chris lands an unpaid internship with the brokerage firm Dean Witter, which is his only hope, and the movie moves back and forth from the totally in control Chris working for Dean Witter, to the increasingly out of control and desperate Chris who has no place to live. The two most poignant scenes in the movie are first when Gardner finds himself locked out of the hotel room he and Christopher had been living in because he hadn't paid the rent, and, as he looks through the window into the now inaccessible room, the sense of desperation as he realizes that he has absolutely no place to go is palpable. Then, at the very end of the movie, the heaviness finally (and mercifully) lifts, as Gardner is offered a position at Dean Witter and obviously holds back tears as he accepts. The relief, again, is palpable.The movie title, of course, comes from the Declaration of Independence, and in an opening narrative, Gardner suggests that perhaps Jefferson wrote it that way to point out that happiness can only be chased; it can't really be caught. And, in pursuit of happiness, Gardner does a lot of running. Will Smith is constantly and literally running in this film, to the point where it became a bit distracting.There's not much to criticize here, though, except that - as I've said - it was a bit heavy to the point at which one of the people I was watching it with sighed and said 'is this guy's life ever going to get any better?' It does, and it's a great story. 9/10",9,0,0,29 March 2007
Goodfellas," A Portrait Of Mob Life
","The obvious comparison for this movie is, of course, 'The Godfather.' Looked at in that way, I thought 'Goodfellas' was the superior movie - actually, not even close. Where some of the characters in 'The Godfather' (especially Brando's Don Corleone) had an almost cartoonish aura around them, everyone in this movie seemed very real. There were no cartoonish elements to this, and no one in this movie was ever fated to be a caricature, in the way Brando as Corleone was. This was a down to earth, realistic story about life in the mob, shown mostly through the eyes of Henry (Ray Liotta), who, as an Irish Italian kid, glamorizes gangsters and gets involved with them as a kid, and then lives his life among them. Liotta was very good, as were all the main actors is this - Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco all did well with their respective parts, and you come away from this movie thinking that you have a feel for what it's like to live this life. As the movie comes to an end, and Henry becomes a snitch, testifying against some of his former 'buddies,' you also get a dose of reality. These guys don't go to the cops out of any real change of heart or because they're suddenly stricken by a guilty conscience and decide to go straight. Henry suddenly realized he was in danger, and the only way to protect himself and his family was to testify. In the voice-over narration the point is well made that, even as he's testifying against these guys, he still envies them their lifestyle and enjoyed sharing it for a good number of years, and going straight is the price he has to pay for safety.Certainly, a better move than 'The Godfather.' In all honesty, I think they're both over-rated on this site as the 2nd-best ('Godfather') and 15-th best ('Goodfellas') movies of all time at the time of writing. Having said that, I did enjoy watching 'Goodfellas.' 8/10",8,0,0,29 August 2009
The Bourne Supremacy," So-So Sequel That Failed To Engage
","Although I couldn't say that I found it spectacular, I did enjoy 'The Bourne Identity' more than I expected to, not really being into the action genre, and so decided to continue on with the series. At best, though, I found 'The Bourne Supremacy' (the second part of the Bourne trilogy) to be only a so-so follow-up that for whatever reason completely failed to engage me the way the first one had managed to. I had a very strong 'been there, done that' reaction to most of what happened in this movie. Car chases, fights, explosions and killings - but while those things contributed to a very good story before, here they seemed to lack any real or at least original focus. The story also seemed to me a bit confused - which, I concede, may well have been a deliberate way of keeping the viewer mindful of Bourne's growing confusion over his identity.The movie featured generally good performances. Matt Damon moved back into the character of Bourne effortlessly, and there was a fairly strong supporting cast, including Brian Cox (another returnee from 'Identity') and Joan Allen as the new character of Pamela Landy - who, I take it, was the CIA chief in Berlin. I truly missed Franka Potente, though, who exited very early in this movie. I thought her character of Marie was one of the more intriguing characters in the first movie.In spite of the good performances, though, the main problem is the one I stated off the top - this just didn't grab hold of me. I thought it was worth perhaps a 4/10.",4,1,2,14 November 2007
The Proposal," Enjoyable And Funny
","This is most definitely the definition of a 'chick-flick' but I have to say that it's also one of the better romantic comedies I've seen in quite a while, highlighted by a very good chemistry between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Bullock's Margaret Tate is an employee's nightmare as the hard-driving boss at a New York City publishing company, while Reynolds as Andrew Paxton is her long-suffering assistant. Unfortunately, Margaret is a Canadian who's about to be deported, and the only out for her is to get married to Andrew so that she can stay in the country. This leads to a fun romp in Alaska, since Margaret, to satisfy the US immigration authorities, is forced to join Andrew in visiting his family for a weekend in the far north. The weekend represents an epiphany of sorts for Margaret as she's reminded what the warmth and love of family really is, as she bonds especially with Andrew's mother and grandmother, and then eventually begins to fall for Andrew himself. Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen played Andrew's parents, but the best supporting role was certainly that of Betty White as Andrew's grandmother. The movie is exactly what a romantic comedy should be - gently but not outrageously funny, with director Anne Fletcher showing a deft touch as she gradually builds the romance between Andrew and Margaret.One minor criticism might revolve around the need for someone to coach Bullock in how a Canadian would pronounce 'Toronto.' She insisted on saying 'To-ron-To' whereas a real Canadian would say something like 'Tuh-Ron-uh' (the second 't' not generally being pronounced, and certainly not emphasized.) That, however, is a minor criticism (albeit one I noticed as a Canadian.) 8/10",8,1,2,19 November 2009
Shark Tale," Good Fun For Kids And Adults Alike
","A fun story and good animation make this feature a movie that the whole family can enjoy together. There's nothing particularly deep or original about it, true, but to expect that would be to miss the point of the movie: it's intended largely for kids, who don't really care about depth or originality - they just want to have fun with it, and for parents who just want to be able to watch a fun movie with their kids. On those notes, the movie scores quite well. The characters are fun, and to the extent that one can talk about 'performances' in an animated movie, both Robert Deniro (as the shark 'Don Lino') and Will Smith (as the Shark Slayer 'Oscar') put on good ones.Essentially, Oscar - a tiny fish who works as a tongue scrubber at the local whale wash - is mistakenly identified as the killer of a great white shark (Lino's son). From that point on, Oscar relishes his newfound celebrity, but finds out that his fame comes with a price (he now has to be the defender of the reef against all sharks, and he has to deal with Lino's desire for revenge against the guy who he thinks took out his son.) Oscar teams up with Lenny (Jack Black), Lino's other son, who happens to be a gentle, vegetarian shark who's something of an embarrassment to his tough dad. (This, and Lenny's decision to dress up like a dolphin, lead to some limited social commentary about the importance of accepting those who are 'different' - which seems to be a message to parents with gay kids, frankly. Adults would get that social commentary; most kids wouldn't.) Eventually, through his adventures, Oscar discovers the value of honesty and Lino comes to understand the importance of accepting people (or fish) as they are.Some of the references in the movie (especially the repeated allusions to 'Jaws' and 'The Godfather') are going to be over the heads of the kids watching and, in all honesty, the story - while fun - isn't going to rival either of those movies, either, but what makes this movie work is the ability for parents and children to enjoy it together. It might not be the best movie either have ever seen, but it has enough for both to make it enjoyable. Other featured voices include Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Katie Couric and Martin Scorsese. 7/10",7,1,2,22 March 2008
The Birds," One Of My Favourite Hitchcock Movies
","'The Birds' stands - in spite of a handful of problems - as one of the more frightening horror movies you're ever going to come across. It's frightening precisely because it's so inexplicable. There are no monsters, no mutants, no aliens, no diseases - none of those things that are usually used to create 'horror.' Instead, there are birds. Gentle birds that we see around us everyday who are usually so frightened of us that they back away if we even get close. Except in the small California coastal town of Bodega Bay, where the local avian population suddenly runs amok, and birds of all species gather together (for no particular reason that's mentioned) and begin a series of escalating and deadly attacks on the local human population. It's the very fact that the attackers are so common around us every day and that this is so unexplained and seems so impossible that gives this movie its greatest power.The first hour or so is a bit long. Hitchcock gives us an extremely lengthy introduction to the various characters that probably could have been done more quickly, although it's in the midst of this introduction that seemingly unimportant things begin to happen - such as Melanie (Tippi Hedren) being inexplicably attacked by just a single bird - at the time more of a curiosity to the townsfolk than anything else. Hitchcock builds the suspense around the bird attacks and also builds their intensity quite well. Some of the effects used in portraying the bird attacks are quite frightening and unsettling, especially the scene in which a huge flock attacks a group of young schoolchildren. I felt a bit of deja vu during that scene as I remembered an incident as a child when I was surrounded by a group of sea gulls who were after my french fries. They weren't attacking of course, but they were all around me and I remember how unnerving and even frightening that was for a young child. The movie leads to no particular conclusion - except for an escape by the main characters as the giant flock of birds look on, apparently having quite effectively taken over the town and driven the humans away, which is exactly as the movie should have been left. To offer a logical, rational, scientific explanation would have weakened the power of the story.The performances were good. Hedren and Rod Taylor as her romantic interest Mitch Brenner were quite effective, and I thought Veronica Cartwright entirely believable as Mitch's younger sister, who becomes gradually more terrified as time goes on. The final scenes, with Melanie and the Brenners seemingly trapped in the house while this huge flock of birds tries to force its way in is quite creepy. Well done by all involved.

Sully," After A Slow Start This Becomes A Superb Story
","I thought 'Sully' got off to a bit of a slow start. I remember the incident well from news reports - Captain Sullenberger landing the massive Airbus A320 in the Hudson River just a few minutes after takeoff because of dual engine failures - and everyone surviving the incident. It sounds like an exciting story, but it's made pretty clear from the start that this is going to be far more about the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board than about the incident itself. Which, I suppose, is understandable. As is pointed out several times in the movie, the entire incident lasted about 208 seconds. You can't really make a movie about a 208 second incident. And, indeed, for the first little while this movie had me a bit disoriented, wondering what really was going on. But the story picks up its pace well, and in the end director Clint Eastwood did a magnificent job of moving back and forth from the narrative about the investigation to what actually happened in the cockpit - and the cockpit scenes were dramatic and seemingly (to me, admittedly a non-pilot) meticulously recreated - as was the ultimate evacuation of the plane afterward. It really was a tribute not just to Sully, but to all of the flight crew, who acted professionally and calmly and ensured the survival of their passengers.The NTSB didn't come across quite as well. Sullenberger became (understandably) a hero almost from the moment this happened. After all, it happened in broad daylight in one of the world's largest cities - lots of people saw it. The depiction of the NTSB investigators was that they were antagonistic toward Sully, perhaps either disturbed or jealous that his media acclaim was getting way ahead of their work, and they came across as people looking to place blame for the incident rather than people who were looking for the truth. The actual investigators disputed how they were portrayed, and my understanding is that even Sullenberger disagreed with the liberties that the writers and Eastwood took with this part of the story. I suppose there was a feeling that a movie has to have a 'bad guy' to create dramatic tension - and the NTSB filled that role perfectly, even if the portrayal was unfair.Tom Hanks is obviously the star of this movie. Aaron Eckhart is along for the ride as Scully's co-pilot, Jeff Skiles, but everything in this movie focuses on Hanks. His performance, I thought, was predictably excellent. It's an understated performance - not high on typical drama or excitement, but portraying Sully as a naturally humble man who finds himself thrust into the spotlight and tormented by the thought that he could have done something different - something safer - although it's made clear that for all his thoughts about alternatives in the end he's confident that he made the right decision - the evidence for that being that all 155 people on the plane survived.Ultimately, after that slow start that lasted for maybe 15 or 20 minutes when the movie seemed a bit off focus, this turned out to be an excellent story of a man who is, indeed, a real hero.

Cinderella Man," Great Rags To Riches Story
","This movie surely has to be counted as one of the great rags-to-riches stories in history, made more poignant by its basis in fact and more entertaining by the superb performances of the actors. Going into the movie I wasn't particularly familiar with James J. Braddock. I knew he had been the heavyweight champion of the world but knew nothing about his personal life and struggles. This movie certainly filled those gaps. The film offers a grittily realistic portrayal of life in the Great Depression as Braddock (Russell Crowe), once promising but now no longer able to box, struggles (and usually fails) to find enough work to support his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and children. He eventually descends from unemployment to welfare to begging just to pay the bills. The struggle was put into even greater perspective by some of the opening scenes which make it clear that Braddock and his family once lived a comfortable, middle-class life before the catastrophe hit.Eventually, Braddock gets another shot at boxing - at first just a one-time shot, as a fill-in for an injured boxer because the promoters couldn't find anyone credible on short notice. Somehow Braddock regains his form and eventually turns that one-shot deal into a shot at the title against the fearsome champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko).I understand Baer's family was upset with director Ron Howard's portrayal of the man. It's true that he didn't come across as Mr. Nice Guy, but based on some of the criticisms I had heard I was expecting to see Baer portrayed as some sort of sadistic monster. Actually, while he certainly taunted Braddock and said some unpleasant things to Mae Braddock (at least according to the movie) I didn't think he came across that badly. In the scene of the two coming across each other at the restaurant it seemed to me that Baer was portrayed as truly concerned about Braddock. Like everyone else, Baer (who had already killed two men in the ring) assumed that Braddock would not only lose the title fight; he'd lose badly. Baer's real message in that encounter seemed to be 'let's find a way out of this because I really don't want to hurt you.' It seemed to me that in the end Baer was also portrayed as a gracious loser once his fight with Braddock was over.I really enjoyed this movie. There's very little to criticize, and it offers the always necessary reminder that no matter how hard you might fall, there's always a chance to get up. 9/10",9,1,1,27 September 2007
Jurassic Park," If You See A T-Rex - DON'T MOVE!!!
","There are a lot of good things about 'Jurassic Park.' The effects on the dinosaurs are excellent. The dinosaurs look, sound and move like real animals. They are completely and totally believable. There's a good reflection on the dangers involved when humanity insists on interfering with the natural world - dinosaurs went extinct without any help from human beings; maybe - even if we could bring them back - human beings should leave them that way is the most direct theme of the movie, although one can easily see the application of that theme about the dangers of human interference in the natural scheme of things going far beyond dinosaurs. And when 'Jurassic Park' is exciting - it's very exciting and when it's suspenseful it's very suspenseful. I think of the t-rex chasing the car and trying to get at the children, or the children desperately hiding and trying to escape from the velociraptors. That's all well done, and the children were actually pretty good in their parts, very believably terrified. This is one of the better performances I've ever seen from children. But, to be honest, it wasn't very consistent.The action was good when there was action. There were, however, sustained moments when there really wasn't very much action and when not much interesting was happening. Actually, that sums up much of the first half of the movie. In addition to that, we were given a collection of characters that I for one at least didn't really care about - at least two of whom (Dr. Malcolm, played by Jeff Goldblum, and Dennis, played by Wayne Knight) seemed totally extraneous to the story. Neither part was necessary to move this along. Dr. Malcolm's 'chaos theory' really didn't interest me, and Dennis added a 'conspiracy' element to the story that really went nowhere. Everything that happened could have been explained by natural causes - like the big storm approaching! Even the children, as well acted as the parts were, seemed like a rather forced addition. It's almost as if someone realized that having no characters to really care about (as I mentioned above) was a problem, and so a decision was made to add a couple of kids for that purpose. Even the leads (Sam Neill and Laura Dern) didn't come across to me as giving much spark to their characters.For all the strengths of this movie - and they were many - there were also more than a few weaknesses.

Valkyrie," Good Account Of The Lead-Up To And The Aftermath Of The July 20 Plot Against Hitler
","I have to give credit for a pretty detailed, largely step by step account, detailing the machinations leading up to the July 20, 1944 attempt by a group of Army officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler and seize power in Germany, as well as for offering much detail about the aftermath of the failed attempt, and the ultimate collapse of the coup. Beginning with Col. Claus von Stauffenberg being recruited into the group of conspirators, and ending with his execution, the movie revolves around him, and its title is taken from orders issued to the German Reserve Army to seize control of Berlin on Hitler's death ('Operation Valkyrie.') If you are at all interested in this period of history (and why else watch this movie) you won't find anything particularly surprising in this, and there certainly isn't any suspense about the outcome. It's simply a pretty good documentation of it. The history is decent enough. I personally think that the movie exaggerated Stauffenberg's role in the coup attempt (and even more his authority over it.) Still, there's no doubt that he was an important figure and deserved to be centre-stage in this dramatization of it. Tom Cruise was an interesting choice to play Stauffenberg. He did well with the part, although Cruise as a German officer (even as an anti-Nazi German officer) was a bit of a stretch. In a broad sense, the July 20 plot wasn't especially consequential. Hitler survived, the War went on and the conspirators were executed. Not a lot really changed because of this. The plot did, however, make it obvious to everyone (including the German people) that there was active opposition to Hitler at high levels. The reasons for the opposition were varied, but as much as we might like to think so had little to do with moral qualms about Hitler's or Nazi ideology, and almost everything to do with the belief that Hitler and the Nazis were leading Germany to destruction by mismanaging the war. So, was Stauffenberg the hero the movie makes him out to be? Hard to say, but he certainly deserves his place in history. 8/10",8,0,0,23 January 2010
All the President's Men," An Interesting Story That Stumbles A Bit At The End
","Not so much a political thriller, this movie (and the book on which it's based) serves as an excellent introduction for the viewer to the inside workings of investigative journalism, as Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein struggle to put together the pieces of the Watergate break-in, and get led progressively higher and higher into the members of Richard Nixon's administration. It's truly fascinating to watch the scandal as it unfolds from a minor and puzzling break-in to a major political scandal implicating the White House itself. There's a good study of the initial suspicion of Woodward and Berstein toward each other, which quickly evolves into them working as a team, a good look at the battle within the Post itself about how far to go with the story, and a revolving door of possible contacts and sources, all of whom try to weasel out of saying anything concrete for the record.Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman put on very strong performances as Woodward and Bernstein respectively, and were totally convincing in the roles. Remember that this movie doesn't focus on the scandal itself but on the investigation into the scandal, so it lacks any sustained 'excitement' but certainly comes across as extremely interesting. I thought the ending was too abrupt. We basically get to the point of Woodward and Bernstein implicating Nixon's chief of staff Bob Haldemand in the scandal, and then to Nixon's second inauguration, after which the fates of all the major players (including Nixon himself) are relayed as headlines coming across on a teletype machine. To me, that represented a weakness. There was surely far more investigative journalism over the next year and a half as the scandal that led eventually to Nixon's resignation was fleshed out. So, the ending stumbled a bit. Still, it's enjoyable and interesting. 6/10",6,3,6,11 March 2010
Draft Day," You Can Enjoy This Even If You're Not A Football Fan
","Be warned off the top: this movie is a little bit niche-ey. It's about the pressures and the wheeling and dealing that takes place on NFL draft day. You don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this, but it does help a little bit. I'm not much of a fan of the NFL to be honest, but I am a hockey fan, and draft day for the NHL has a similar feel to it, so I could easily get into this. My wife, on the other hand, isn't a sports fan at all, but she enjoyed the movie, periodically asking me questions about the draft and how it works. So, this being a bit of a niche-ey movie, my advice to a non-sports fan who watches it would be to watch it with someone who knows a bit about how draft day works and can explain a few points now and then.The story itself revolves around Sonny Weaver, Jr., played by Kevin Costner. In the context of the movie, Weaver is the general manager of the Cleveland Browns. He's got a high draft pick, but not the top draft pick, when an unexpected opportunity arises to trade for the top pick. He has doubts, but he's pressured by an owner who wants him to make a big splash at the draft, and he's pressured by a head coach who wants to win now and not build for the future. In the midst of it all he's also dealing with his girlfriend, who's pregnant and also works in the Browns front office, and he has his mom on his back, with his father (a former Browns coach whom Sonny, Jr. actually fired) having recently died. So, while this is mostly about the ins and outs of the draft, there's also some personal melodrama involved.It's a good movie. It presents a realistic look at exactly what goes on in a team's 'war room' on draft day as decisions are made regarding young players who are about to become very wealthy young men. It also has a really good (and even exciting) ending as Sonny works on the big deal and makes his final decisions. It's a bit niche-ey, perhaps, but it still has enough for everyone to enjoy.

The Fighter," The Story Of Mickey Ward
","As any movie of this type has to do, it finally draws you into the protagonist's situation and gets you rooting for him. In this case the protagonist is real-life boxer Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) who has to overcome big odds - not the least of which is an extremely dysfunctional family headed up by his controlling mother Alice (Melissa Leo) and his drug addict brother Dicky (Christian Bale) who used to be a boxer and who's claim to fame was knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard (or did Sugar Ray slip?) and who now wants to live his dream through his brother. I appreciated the fact that Sugar Ray appeared as himself in a couple of brief scenes. By the time Mickey gets his title shot you are rooting for him, and you do admire his strength in overcoming the challenges he's faced. The actual title shot, mind you, struck me as a bit anti- climactic to be honest. It was pretty quickly portrayed and frankly the whole thing ultimately left me a bit empty, although I was satisfied to see Mickey become the champ.For three-quarters of the movie, though, the focus is really on the dysfunctional family relationship, and the challenge presented to that relationship by the sudden appearance of Charlene (Amy Adams) - a local bartender and college dropout who hooks up with Mickey and pushes him to escape his family's controlling influence. This was a good performance from Adams. I found her the most interesting of the cast, because she was playing a character very different from the usual cute and sweet roles I've seen her in, and so she demonstrated a versatility I hadn't seen from her before. Wahlberg and Bale were all right, but I didn't find anything especially noteworthy about their performances.In the end, the biggest weakness of this movie was that it really failed to draw me in until the title fight (and to an extent the fight that led up to the title fight.) I was bored frankly by the family, who struck me as a sort of Massachussetts version of 'white trash' and who weren't really all that interesting. I can't imagine growing up with those sisters. Mickey deserves credit just for not punching any of them out. This really didn't do a great deal for me. It offers about half an hour that really intensely interested me, which fizzled out in a truly too abrupt ending and focused mostly on an unappealing family.",4,17,28,2 February 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," Ridiculously Over The Top
","Obviously, this movie is a sort of 'Death Wish'-inspired movie, with the main character (Clyde, played by Gerard Butler) out to get revenge after the gruesome murders of his wife and daughter. The difference is that Clyde doesn't turn vigilante. Instead, 10 years later, he sets out to take revenge on the justice system (mainly represented by the prosecutor Nick, played by Jamie Foxx) that agreed to a deal with one of the guys who invaded his home in exchange for testimony against the second.The idea has been done. It may be inspired by 'Death Wish' but it's been done elsewhere as well. Done to death might be a way of putting it! Basically two things bothered me. The lesser of the two was that the movie essentially opens with the murders, so I had no chance to develop any real connection at all with the wife and daughter who were killed. A little more development of the family's life would have drawn me more fully into Clyde's anguish. Of course, I can understand the raw emotions that would be involved, but there's no real connection. That's a weakness. Mostly, though, I just found this to be ridiculously over the top.I have no objections to movies that are 'over the top.' Generally speaking, though, even an over the top movie has to have some semblance of believability; something that causes me to say 'yeah. I could see that happening, no matter how silly it seems.' This one had none of that. The character of Clyde - as he's eventually developed in the movie (both in his background and in how he's pulling off the revenge he seeks) - was, I'll say it again, ridiculously over the top. I couldn't even begin to buy into it - not even for a second. And, given the aura of total unbelievability involved, I found it dragged on and on. You know Clyde will eventually be caught - just get to it, was my attitude through most of this. Get it over with. After the first few shocking bits of revenge, it lost its power and I just wanted to get to the climax - which, to be honest, I found a bit anti-climactic. (2/10)",2,9,15,29 April 2012
High Fidelity," A Guaranteed Cure For Insomnia
","I have no idea what John Cusack was thinking, but his name is plastered all over this disaster: star, producer, writer. If I were him, I'd be afraid for my career: very afraid!Simply put, this story about the past and present romances of Rob Gordon (Cusack) is BORING! I can generally pay attention to any movie, no matter how bad. I desperately look for something nice to say about a movie - even the terrible ones. But this one? I fought, but at least three times I dozed off in the midst of it. It is supposed to be a comedy, and yet not once did even a modest chuckle escape from me; I'm not even sure I ever smiled at the lame attempts at humour. The movie is a little less than 2 hours in length, and yet it felt as if 6 hours had passed by before this thing finally ended. About 2/3 of the way through my wife looked at me and said about Gordon (Cusack): 'He's a loser.' That sums up the entire movie.1/10.",1,7,19,30 March 2001
The Godfather," Count Me In The Minority
","First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.I thought 'The Godfather' was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's 'business' never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family 'business' to the eventual 'Don.'It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.6/10",6,169,346,25 November 2002
