Airlift," Patriotic and moving
","Movies like Airlift are not rare. We get our dose of patriotism every year. The only things that change are the setting and the cast. Airlift, however, manages to strike a chord with the truth it portrays. Firstly, in sharp contrast to Argo, the Indian govt did not jump to the rescue of Indians stuck in Kuwait. Any Indian knows how things move in the govt sector and this was aptly portrayed. It is always one or two odd people who get things moving and such was the case in Airlift too. There are a couple of scenes which can happen only in movies but those apart, the movie painted a very real picture of the largest ever evacuation program conducted by any country. When Akshay Kumar signs off in the end saying he is still cynical about a lot of issues in India but never asks what his country has done for him, he is echoing the sentiments of 1.7 lakh people who were part of Operation Airlift and many more.",8,0,1,26 January 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," There is no despair without hope..
","When a director of the prowess of Christopher Nolan makes anything that falls short of The Dark Knight(2008), it is considered a letdown. The Dark Knight Rises becomes a victim of the high standards set by Nolan and Heath Ledger(Joker) in the 2008 film which revolutionized the way the world looked at comic book movies. The most awaited movie of the decade failed to deliver on many accounts. However the sheer magic of Nolan and his cast create an indelible impact.The movie discovers the chilling effects of terrorism and capitalism by portraying the worst that could possibly happen. The villain Bane(played by Tom Hardy) is imposing but his character is ill written. He is all brute force with no depth. That he is inaudible doesn't help. The inevitable comparison with Heath Ledger goes against him too, making him the weakest link in the chain.Christian Bale gets into the character completely and delivers a stunning performance. Anne Hathaway is a pleasure to watch. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a surprise package. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman are their usual classic self. Marion Cotillard could have been explored further.The action sequences are mind-blowing, the ending epic. The USP of Batman movies is that it stresses on the fact that anyone can be a hero. The legend of the Dark Knight ends but the franchise will live on forever and will be counted as one of the most successful trilogies ever pulled off.",8,2,5,20 July 2012
