Love and Death," Woody's worst
","This is by a long way Woody Allen's worst film ever. It is even worse than his early efforts Take the Money and run and Bananas. The slapstick is excruciating. Allen trips over his rifle when he marches and gooses women with his sword when he bows. The verbal humour is even thinner. One can only imagine that Allen was taking an evening class in philosophy at the time he wrote the script; some of the supposedly funny verbal exchanges between Boris and Sonia could have been lifted straight from his philosophy homework. Allen returns more successfully to the Russian novel as inspiration in Crimes and Misdemeanours. The moral anguish over whether to kill one man, Napoleon, for the good of many foreshadows similar themes in Crimes and Misdemeanours and Bullets Over Broadway but the treatment here is very immature.",1,3,20,30 August 2001
Antz," Not particularly antlike
","Woody Allen does the voiceover for the main character Z, an ant in this animated film. The animation is elegant but rather subdued in tone. The film starts familiarly with Z on the psychiatrist's couch but it soon runs out of steam. The script is disappointing because the ant behaviour is not particularly antlike. I found it disconcerting because Z spoke like Woody Allen but looked nothing like him.",4,2,5,29 October 2001
Match Point," Shoot The Pianist
","Having run out of backers in the USA, Woody Allen came to England to shoot this film for the BBC. Maybe his paymasters influenced the treatment because this film turns out to be exactly like the sort of pap that the BBC serves up every every night of the week and particularly on Sundays. After a hard week's work you let your brain have an early night and settle down to watch a BBC drama with implausible plotting and cardboard characters inhabiting an English middle-class never-never land. One is tempted to think that Woody is having a joke at his paymasters' expense but that is probably being too charitable.Some critics have complained about the wooden acting but, again, it is no worse than you see on British television. Anyway, the dialogue is so implausible that it is best delivered by mediocre actors. Saddest for me was seeing the embarrassment of a great actor, Brian Cox, having to deliver lines such as 'He's right Helen  I think you've had one too many G and Ts'.The theme is loosely based on the plot of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. In fact we see the protagonist Chris reading this novel early on in the film. It reminds me that one of Woody's greatest films, Crimes and Misdemeanours also took the Dostoevsky novel as its starting point. What really upsets me, seeing this phony film, is the thought that, maybe, all Woody's wonderful Manhatten-set films are equally phony and I only think they sound authentic from my ignorant English viewpoint. That gets me thinking that, maybe, many of the masterpieces of world cinema that I so admire are phony too. It's a sobering thought. Woody has a lot to answer for.Plenty of other reviewers have given examples of Woody's ignorance of all things English in making this film so I will end with just one. On several occasions we see our middle class family in their box at Covent Garden and twice we get a glimpse of the performance on stage, of La Traviata and Rigoletto. On both these occasions, the opera is accompanied solely by a badly played piano. I know British opera houses are a bit strapped for cash but I have never heard of one having to put on an opera without an orchestra.",1,17,28,22 February 2008
Midnight in Paris," Nostalgia ain't what it used to be
","This is an amusing tale about a time traveller in 1920s Paris, wrapped up in an irritating framing device about a group of obnoxious modern-day Americans staying in the city. Allen is fond of magical plots and, as in The Purple Rose of Cairo, his most successful venture in this genre, he does not waste time on explaining how the magic works. His protagonist, Gil, just has to sit on some steps in Monmartre when the clock strikes midnight and he is transported back to his golden age. The audience has an amusing time recognising the famous denizens of 1920s Monmartre before they identify themselves and there are a few good jokes. The one I liked best is Gil suggesting the plot of The Exterminating Angel to a bemused Louis Bunuel. Interestingly, Allen also referenced the Bunuel film in The Purple Rose of Cairo where the on-screen characters sit around in evening dress, unable to leave. The stand-out cameos in this section of the film are Adrian Brody as a rhinoceros-obsessed Salvador Dalí and Kathy Bates as an unfeasibly accommodating Gertrude Stein. But I did miss Henry Miller and Anaïs Nin.In the framing device Gil is staying in Paris with his airhead fiancée, her Tea Party Republican parents and two pretentious friends. This part of the film could usefully have been left on the cutting-room floor. Even more irritating is that it is shot in the style of a travelogue, rather like Vicky Cristina Barcelona. We see interminable shots of Parisian tourist attractions accompanied by mind-numbing, imitation Django Reinhardt music. I have to declare an interest here: I used to work in Paris and I am immune to its so-called charms. One of the characters says: 'That Paris exists and anyone could choose to live anywhere else in the world will always be a mystery to me'. One of the most irritating things that I found about Paris was that most of my Parisian colleagues would have agreed with that sentiment.It is amazing how even the most brilliant actors, when playing the lead in Allen's films, adopt his mannerisms, vocal tics and persona. Owen Wood is Gil and is by no means a brilliant actor but he produces the most accurate imitation of Woody Allen that I have yet seen on the screen. And I don't mean that in a nice way. Marion Cotillard is Adriana, his love interest from the 1920s. Her Golden Age is the Belle Epoque but when they go back there and meet Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin and Degas they are told that, no, the Golden Age is the Renaissance. Allen is making a small, but valid point here: that everyone hankers after an earlier period when everything was wonderful but, for the vast majority of people, now is the best of possible times. Eventually Gil comes to accept this, not least because he cannot envisage a world without painkillers and antibiotics. I tend to agree: in the 1920's I would not have been able to beam down this film from a satellite and watch it in the comfort of my own home.",7,0,1,14 February 2012
Annie Hall," Allen's love affair with New York
","This was Allen's first popular success and the first of a series of films that used what seems to be autobiographical material to dissect New York angst. Annie Hall seems to be a comparatively straightforward account of Allen's affair with Diane Keaton, who plays the part of Annie Hall in the film. Both main characters comment on the relationship by directly addressing the camera or by stepping out of their bodies and observing themselves or, at the beginning of the relationship when they are trying to impress each other, by using subtitles to reveal what they are really thinking while we hear them saying something completely different. Keaton's playing is initially irritating although, when the film was first released audiences were amused by her vacant manner, her erratic dress sense and her habit of trailing off sentences with `...oh well, lah de dah'.  Her later scenes after her transformation are more successful.
Jeff Goldblum has one line, in what must have been his first film appearance. Sigourney Weaver also appears as `Woman in cinema queue', but I must have blinked because I did not see her. Marshall MacLuhan, the media guru also appears as himself. Paul Simon  has an amusing cameo as an oleaginous Californian who lures Keaton to California. In fact Allen is most venomous when he is depicting California and Californians. His identification with New York is total. Annie Hall says `Alvie is like New York: he is an island'. In retrospect this film can be seen as marking the end of Allen's slapstick period and the beginning of his long series of films that depict his love affair with New York, and, by implication, with himself.",Null,0,0,30 August 2001
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Whatever Doesn't Work
","I find it paradoxical that Woody Allen's worst films, such as Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona are currently the only ones that are box office successes. His better films are mainly viewed by just a few people in New York, the West Coast and France. Woody's films are erratically released in the UK, so I saw this after his later, much better, effort Whatever Works.Basically, this is yet another remake of Manhatten. The difference is that the emotionally retarded, selfish characters in Manhatten are funny. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is meant to be serious drama. At least I think it is since I did not crack a smile in the entire 96 minutes.We know from the films that Allen made in the UK that he has a tin ear for British English and he sets his stories in a bogus England that has never existed. I suspect that his Barcelona is equally bogus. The film looks like a 1950s travelogue. It has an inept voice-over and some irritating travelogue-style incidental music. The voice-over does not tell us anything that we cannot see: 'They particularly enjoyed the works of Gaudi' (shot of Barcelona Cathedral) 'and Miró (shot of Vicky and Cristina admiring a Miró. 'They strolled past the church in the wonderful summer night air while people celebrated' (V&C walk past a church while people light fireworks. 'finally winding up about midnight in a little restaurant', (we see V&C sitting in a restaurant).Juan Antonio, played by a bemused-looking Javier Bardem, takes Vicky for a meal and, at the end, says: 'Would you like to go to hear some wonderful guitar tonight?'. Cut to a scene in a candlelit garden where a small group of people listen rapturously to a guitarist playing Albeniz. It gives the impression that there are guitarists continuously hanging around Barcelona gardens on the off-chance that someone might want to hear some wonderful guitar music. This level of bogusness makes me wonder whether I am being naïve about Woody's New York films. Maybe they are equally bogus.Maybe Woody directed this on autopilot while he was thinking about the plot of Whatever Works. Vicky actually says 'Whatever works' in response to the revelation that Cristina is enjoying a threesome with Juan Antonio and his ex-wife. There is the same ludicrous plot development where Cristina's holiday snaps get elevated to the level of great art. It is funny in Whatever Works but preposterous here. It only serves as an excuse to get Scarlett Johannson and Penelope Cruz into a darkroom for a bit of lesbian action. This being a Woody Allen film there is no on-screen sex so what we have is a film with soft-porn production values but without the soft-porn.The actors struggle throughout to make sense of the ludicrous dialogue. Rebecca Hall is the most successful. At the beginning of the film she looks as though she could be a worthy successor to Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow as a Woody Allen muse but eventually even she too is submerged in a sea of implausibility.",1,13,22,20 May 2010
Sweet and Lowdown," Djangology
","This film is a mixture of fake documentary, in the style of Zelig, and straightforward narrative. It presents a very beautiful evocation of the 1930's jazz scene. As with many of Woody Allen's movies I found myself missing the brilliant dialogue because I was listening to the wonderful music. The guitar on the soundtrack is played by Howard Alden who manages to sound reminiscent of Django Reinhardt without slavishly copying him. Sean Penn gives a very amusing performance and is quite convincing in the many scenes where he has to play the guitar. It occurs to me that many younger people watching this film may never have heard of Django Reinhardt and may be slightly bemused by a story about someone who is so obsessed by him.
Woody Allen sometimes underwrites the supporting characters in his screenplays. In this film he has taken this tendency to the extreme by giving Samantha Morton no lines at all as the mute Hattie. She looks like Giulietta Masina in La Strada but she cannot tell a story with her face in the way that Masina could and mainly restricts herself to a cute smile. This is perhaps Allen's fault. He may deliberately have restricted Morton's role to looking winsome during Penn's tremendous displays of vocal pyrotechnics.",9,0,0,14 January 2002
