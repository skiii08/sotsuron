Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ugh!
","Ugh! This is not worth your time or money.  Lucas gets so excited about the special effects that he forgets the story.  It helps in a three part story to actually have one.Did any one connect with these distracting and annoying computer generated things, such as Jar Jar Stinks and the buzzy blue winged beast ??? Or with the flat, dull acting of the humans ??? or the contrived final battle between Darth Dull and Que Gone Jinn ???There were two especially distressing 'plot' elements. The first was the physical manifestation of the Force.  Something in the blood.  You can measure it. Argh! Where's the glorious spiritual mystery in that.  And secondly, Anakins virgin birth is unnecesarily Messianic.  Don't you think ?One highlight is to know that Lucas can redo Ben Hur.  The pod race is a good piece of film.  But a pod race does not make a movie.So it doesn't have a story and it doesn't have characters you care about. Lucas will still make his billion.  Such is the state of story telling at the millennium.",2,0,1,12 July 1999
Toy Story 2," Please, Please Hollywood make more of these
","Do not miss this movie.  Technically brilliant.  Beautiful story .  Laugh till you cry. Cry till you laugh.For all ages 2-92.Pixar and Disney have out done themselves.Please Hollywood make more just like this.
