Hereditary," 7/8ths of a great horror film
","Sooooooo Close...But sorry, the last 10 minutes ruins the film. There were so many great ideas...and some really scary twists. I loved the way it built slowly, with little crumbs being dropped along the way. And then the ending... just silly. There are so many ways that the ending could have been better. And frankly, a lot of the movies that this one is compared to got it right. This just felt like they ran out of gas, and tried to tie it together with something that will scare Catholics...and just to make it work for everyone else, by adding a ton of weird gore. Let's face it...if King Paimon is really the badass demon that the legends say he was, he didn't need a goofy group of 'satanist' if he wanted to show up and take control. Oh well... a lot of fun. Collette was great! But, this is no '6th Sense.'",8,10,19,16 June 2018
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Better than Australia...but misses the mark
","In the past four days, we have seen four movies. Milk, Australia, Slumdog Millionaire and Benjamine Button. Of the four, the 'blockbusters' were the weakest. Both Australia and Button are FAR too long, and pull from previous films for their content and concepts.While I loved the performances of both Pitt and Blanchett, the story is just too long (especially when it was derived from a F. Scott Fitzgerald short story). I wanted it to go somewhere. The 'big twist' was telegraphed in a zillion ways. Beautiful faces and places...but not much more to offer.If you have a choice between all of the films out during the holiday season, see Slumdog Millionaire. FAR better movie-- original, great story, moving, and not a lick of CGI or special effects.",6,3,9,25 December 2008
"Hail, Caesar!"," Soooooooooo Disappointed
","Let's start with the fact that I am a huge fan of the Cohen Brothers. I have seen all of their films in the theater, and I own a ton of their movies on Blu Ray. I also understand that they have an equally wide range of styles and genres in which they work as producers, writers, and directors. However, after watching the trailers, I assumed we were in for something similar to their brilliant 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou?,' that to this day, remains one of my favorite movies and soundtracks of all time. Nope. Not even close. I am not going to 'spoil' anything here regarding plot lines, because the 'plot' was so disjointed, random, and disconnected, that to imply that there was an actual plot would be misleading. You know you are in trouble when you have to rely on voice-over narration to try to hold something together. But even the narration seemed confusingly unhelpful. Three, or was it four, or maybe even five, sub-plots that had no real connection whatsoeverexcept that they were all set in the golden era of Hollywood. The irony of having the whole 'Commies in Hollywood' bitespecially with the ridiculous submarine scenein the year the 'Trumbo' was released, was just too much to handle. There was a perceptive groan in the audience...no laughs. This was, at best, an overblown, over-produced, over-cast mess.Someone in the audience behind us said, 'It's like they are trying to do homage to Wes Andersonbut don't seem to know what makes Wes Anderson movies work.' I couldn't agree more. The production value was entertaining in its bombastbut the cast was completely wasted on this. Sorry guysI'll remember you for Fargo, No Country for Old Men, Oh Brother, The Big Lebowski, Raising Arizona, and even Barton Fink. But this one? I am going to do my best to forget this one altogether.",4,25,48,10 February 2016
