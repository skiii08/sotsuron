Mission: Impossible III," Nice Progression...
",I enjoyed this movie more than I thought. I loved all three mission impossible movies but I enjoyed the 'edge' this one had. It finally gave Ethan a connection to something outside of saving the world. He had an edge which was great. The villain was the best and most daring yet. Amazing movie and it fit really well into the trilogy. The love interest was well played and it brought a sense of suspense into the movie. It added that unsuspected ending and it kept you guessing which was nice. I would totally recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the first two. Even if you didn't see the others this is a great movie standing alone. Enjoy!!!,10,2,4,19 May 2006
