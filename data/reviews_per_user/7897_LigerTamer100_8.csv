It," Better than the original in my opinion.
","In my opinion, this remake of the Stephen King book 'IT' is better than the 1990 version. A lot of people likes the original and hates this remake and that's fine with me, we like whatever we see. But for me, the original wasn't at all scary at all, there was only two scenes that I did find creepy, the kid actors were great, and Tim Curry as Pennywise was hilarious and enjoyable to watch, but that's it. And don't get me started with the book. This however has more than that, this new Pennywise is more creepy than funny (except that one scene where he's dancing that is now a meme), there's a lot more creepy scenes threw the movie, the cast was great, Georgie was one heck of a scary kid in this movie, and the kids were as good as the original (definitely Finn Wolfhard as Richie, he was awesome). If you like the original, that's great. But I'm not really a fan of the original and I think this is more creepier and better. Now be careful at who you find because you might float down here.",8,0,2,5 February 2018
Zootopia," My favorite Disney movie of all time.
","Five words: Best Disney movie ever made! Why you may ask? Because I love everything about the movie. I love the characters, the story, the animation, even the message about human races, or animal races I should say. When I saw the trailer, I thought it would just be another good movie by Disney, but boy was I wrong. It was fantastic! Amazing! Awesome! I just can't stop loving this movie! And I think the message is strong about treating each other equally, and we needed this message and I'm glad Disney made this movie about the message.And thanks to this movie, I read the good side of fan fiction. There's so many well written Zootopia fan fictions, some I just can't stop reading till the very end like a real book. But how did this movie got me into fan fiction? It's because of the ending where Nick said 'You know you love me.' and then Judy replied 'Do I know that? Yes, yes I do.' it maybe in a friendly way, but it's more than that in my opinion. As an inter myself, I think Judy & Nick would be a great Disney couple in the sequel, IF they make a sequel.If Disney doesn't make a sequel, than I'm going to be upset on Disney. Don't you agree.",10,3,4,25 November 2018
Toy Story 4," Good sequel, but not great
","Back in 2015 or 2016, I heard that Pixar was going to make a Toy Story 4, I wasn't sure what to think. I thought the third movie and a few shorts and specials was enough for the Toy Story franchise. And what do I think of the movie? It's better than I thought.It's not as good as the previous movies, but at least it wasn't like Cars 2. I really like how Bo Peep became an amazing character with skills instead of being in her dress and a pole. Ducky and Bunny are very funny, I laughed so hard when they were telling Buzz and Giggles their ideas and how they explained their ideas during the post credits.I think the only character I didn't like very much was Gabby Gabby, the reason why is because I don't find her much as a villian. Her backstory is that her voicebox is broken and she needs a new one so she can have one last chance to be with a child, meh, that's not much of a villian type of story, I prefer the story behind Latso from the previous movie.I do like the ending because it makes sense why Woody left the group, he hasn't been with Bo Peep for nine years and it just doesn't feel right if they went different ways after so long without seeing each other, plus Woody hasn't been played with for who knows how long so it's best to have a new life where he can actually do something with his new friends and the old group can take care of each other without him.So yeah, I think it's a good sequel to (hopefully) end the Toy Story franchise, but not as good as the other movies that we know and love.",8,1,1,22 November 2019
Cars 2," The worst Pixar movie ever.
","As we all know, this movie became the worst movie Pixar has ever made. In the commentary, John Lassiter said that he has always wanted to make a spy movie. Really? Than why didn't he thought about making a original Pixar movie on that instead of using that as a sequel to Cars? To this day, there hasn't been a Pixar movie that hasn't been bad as this and I think it should stay that way. This is a good example of a movie that was made for merchandise only, I mean I remember seeing merchandise based on this movie everywhere and it is ridicules. The part that seems to bother me the most is Holly Shiftwale became half plane towards the end of the movie, why didn't she become half plane from the beginning? Now let's all agree that Pixar learned their lesson and will never make a movie as bad as this, hopefully. I mean, look at Cars 3, it proves how much they learned from their mistakes and to me, Cars 3 is the true sequel to the first Cars movie and not this terrible sequel.",4,1,1,25 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Star Wars movie I like but a lot of people hates
","A couple years ago, Episode 8 of one of the best franchises ever came out and boy did it have serious mixed reviews. I was in my final year of high school and I had a friend who's a serious fan of Star Wars and he told me it sucked, but I didn't listened to him and I wanted to find out for myself. It took me longer to finally watch it for the first time than I thought, I finally watched it in February 2019 when I finally got the DVD for the first time. And what did I think of it? I actually enjoy it.Sure, Finn and Rose's side of the movie and Leia using the force to get back to the shop is pretty poor. But Rey and Luke's side of the movie was actually good.Luke being a broken Jedi from a past event and refusing to train Rey makes sense to me and yet a lot of people are mad about Luke refusing makes fans mad and I just don't get it. Because Yoda did the same thing when he refused to train Luke in Empire Strikes Back and people don't get mad on that.Speaking of Yoda, I was surprised to see him as a Muppet again when I first watched the movie because I was not expecting that and it's been years since we last saw Yoda as a Muppet. And I love the fact that Frank Oz did all the movements than just the voice because he stopped doing that since 2002 from being a muppeteer.So if your interested in seeing this movie and pretty optimistic about it, than your in a great time watching it.",9,13,23,20 December 2019
Toy Story," Pixar's big break with this movie
","Man, what a classic this movie is, clearly anyone's childhood now. Twenty five years ago, this movie was out and it blew everyone's mind and gave the best animation company ever (in my opinion) the big break they disserve, now look where their at today.Sure, some of the animation in the movie hasn't aged well like the humans, but it proves how much had changed over the years with the animation Pixar does.This is the movie that's worth watching many times, no matter how old you are.",9,1,1,24 January 2020
Toy Story 2," One of the best Pixar sequels ever.
","Back in the golden age of Pixar when they were still new to making movies, they went ahead and did their first sequel (and only one for 11 years before more came out), they made Toy Story 2 and it's without a doubt one of their greatest.What I think what makes this movie one of Pixar's best is that they really concentrated on the movie, like the animation and the story. Along with the behind the scenes of this movie, I can't imagine how stressed they were with it by redoing the entire story in under nine months before the due date, making the animation better than the first movie, and almost losing the entire file and yet one computer saved everything. I mean, wow, that takes a lot of blood and sweat just to make this movie possible.The movie is better than the first one, it has more action, more characters to love, and they even made Jessie's backstory really emotional. There's one scene that still amazes me to this day and that's when Woody's eye gets clean, you can see the dust getting wiped out and all sparkly again, too this day I still have no idea how they made that happen and yet it was the late 1990s, that one of the moments that shows how great Pixar can really be.This is under my top 5 favorite Pixar films ever, and it shows why. Before they got out of hand with sequels, this one the only sequel they ever made and their animation kept getting better and better as time went by.",10,1,1,21 April 2020
Toy Story 3," The darkest Pixar movie ever made.
","I remember seeing this on the big screen, it was such a big wait and for good reasons because everyone wanted to see a Toy Story 3, including me. Back in 2009 one night I watched a trailer for the movie and I was really pumped up,and boy was it worth it. I didn't know what to expect with the movie but the creativity from Pixar. It was darker than I think anyone expected, the villain was creepy, the plot was a masterpiece, and the ending was tear-jerking. I also think his is the movie that fully showed the strong relationship with Buzz and Jessie, thanks to this movie I ship them, the previous movie did good with them too but there was only a scene or two that showed that relationship. We'll just wait to see what the next movie brings and if it can top this movie (which I doubt).",10,2,3,30 June 2018
