Walk the Line," The story of the life and love of one of the most recognizable people in music.....
","AWESOME! I grew up on country music and knew quite a bit about both Johnny Cash and June/ The Carter Family...I wasn't sure I wanted to see this movie since I know how Hollywood tends to treat country music... boy! am I glad I went with my husband that day! It was surprising/familiar, very touching and very tastefully done, from the young wife/mother ( Gennifer Goodwin) facing time at home alone with her young family, to the drug dependency, to the way June was so hesitant to become involved with him, to the way the Carter family rallied around John as 'mixed up'.... It was just awesome! And hilarious! And sensuous! And harsh! .... The constant thread of June in the background (from 12 year old boy onward) shows how she just was his true love all of his life... The music just floored me! I could tell the differences in the voices but the attitude and presence of both John and June was just dead on....Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are now my favorite actor and actress, simply for the fact that they cared so much for these characters (people) they were playing it shows! I never have been a huge Johnny Cash fan... I was more into the type of music played by the Carter family but I definitely enjoyed the whole experience....I am very impressed how genuine and believable the whole storyline is... nothing over-the-top or ridiculous...just very real and very very good!",10,0,0,1 March 2006
