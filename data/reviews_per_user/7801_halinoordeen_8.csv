It," Insipid film
","The dialogue is pitched at the level of a 10 year old . Vast swathes of the film are focused on chat between young children . Imagine if one was forced to sit and listen to a group of 10-12 year olds chatting for 2 hours , it may be mildly bemusing but will not appeal to an adult .That is analogous to sitting through this film . Very banal and sorely disappointing given the rave reviews which are obviously fake ..And it is not remotely scary,.",1,5,8,2 February 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Dull as Dishwater
","This film should be classified as a sedative . Honestly , I tried watching it to completion 3 times to no avail as fell asleep midway through . I fear it may send me into a coma the next time ! There are no redeeming qualities here . Dull non cohesive plot , insipid characters , poor editing . I could go on but will curb myself to prevent boring you. Just take my word for it .",1,15,28,10 June 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Bizarre and shallow
","Are you kidding me?
Is this the best Hollywood can come up with nowadays?You cannot empathise with any of the characters ( even the supposed protagonist) as they are not remotely likeable, and all they do is curse all the time. Is this bunch of redneck hillbillies reflective of small town America? 
Hollywood has forgotten how to fundamentally tell a story , which should be the basis of any engaging film.",2,1,1,29 May 2018
Bird Box," Absolutely Relentless Horror thriller
","Wow, the level of tension in this film reaches excruciating levels . It really is unremitting and unabating till the end .It is a palpable tension I have not experienced in a movie for years. Oh , and Sandra Bullock is bloody marvellous here .",10,2,8,30 December 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Boring and Dull
","I though the plot would be more detailed and mature .Instead it is a very generic story that doesn't pick pace . Plot development has clearly taken a backseat to visuals .It feels like watching a 2 hour videogame .May appeal to geeky teen boys , nothing for adults here !!",1,12,25,3 May 2019
Aladdin," Really Entertaining!
",This was tastefully done . They have stuck to the imprint of the original classic tale without much tinkering and translated it to live action . Thankfully the director has not succumbed to the plague of political correctness currently sweeping through hollywood and just let the classic tale live and breathe!,10,0,1,15 November 2019
Logan," Boring and predictable
","There is no arc of story development or plot progression . No captivating screenplay.Long periods of tedium with sulky dialogue interspersed with wolverine or his feral minion child slicing people. Copy and paste several times and you have the film in its entirety. I am by no means averse to well filmed gore , but it is senselessly included in this film as it does not enhance or progress the (meagre)story line. . There are absolutely no plot twists or any suspenseful moments . The plot is mostly static and you can pretty much predict the scenes after the first 15 minutes . A TOTAL waste of time and money .",1,6,14,29 July 2017
Arrival," Very mundane and dull
","I am genuinely perplexed as to why this film has garnered such positive reviews . As is usually the case , film critics have got it completely wrong . The plot is really quite tepid and underdeveloped . No potent or interesting development of the story line. Even the special effects are dull. Compared to movies such as Interstellar (excellent) or Oblivion (very good) , this was a really banal and uninspired effort . The story is WAFER thin .One gets the feeling you are watching the 'emperors new clothes 'for want of a better analogy . Do yourself a favour and watch Interstellar again if you really want to be entertained .Also , stop spouting about the 'emotional depth' of the twist . I could just watch 'Terms of Endearment' if I needed a powerful wallop to my heart strings - much superior!",2,8,14,13 April 2017
