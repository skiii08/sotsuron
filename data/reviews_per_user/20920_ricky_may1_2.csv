United 93," The Greatest Film Ever Made. period
","This is the single best movie i have ever seen. It's so harrowing and suspenseful and realistic. The fear and confusion those people went through must have been terrifying but they managed to overcome their fear and unite to try and retake their plane against a faceless enemy. On a day we suffered unthinkable disaster and devastating defeat, Flight 93 brought consolation to many people as it shows that even against all odds we can stand together in the face of danger. This film should be preserved as a reminder that we are all capable of self sacrifice and heroism when we are at our most vulnerable. Paul Greengrass has created a masterpiece that will stand the test of time as a stirring tribute to all those who died on 9/11.RIP Flight 93 passengers and crew.",10,2,4,12 June 2011
Carrie," Beautiful Tragic and Dreamlike horror
","In 1976 Stephen King and Brian Depalma came together and working from King's material crafted one of the best movies ever created. The film tells the tragic tale of Carrie White (played marvelously by Sissy Spacek) a mousy abused girl who suffers endless torment at the hands of her classmates and fanatically religious mother (Piper Laurie who's also incredible). However, one of the girls Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels guilty and sets up her boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to take her to the prom instead of her. Another girl Christine Hargensen(Nancy Allen) gets her juvenile boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta in a very funny role) to play a prank on Carrie. Little does everyone know Carrie's dark secret: She is Telekinetic and once the prank is pulled, a holocaust of destruction is released like non ever seen before.This Classic from the 70's is flawless in every way; the acting is all top notch the effects are remarkable and the ending is haunting and tragic at the same time. The fact that Carrie even causes the death of the two people who reach out to her proves that not even the truly innocent survive all the time.",10,5,9,16 November 2010
