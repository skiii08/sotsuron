Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," WORST MOVIE EVER MADE
","There are no excuses that can justify this film. We waited almost twenty years for this movie. This will go down as the most disappointing movie ever.Any true fan of the original trilogy would honestly admit that Lucas has completely lost it. There were signs that this was coming: Howard the Duck; Willow; the 'special edition' additions etc. Lucas is so out of touch it is amazing. Anyone that tries to justify this movie is simply lying to themselves. The first Star Wars was, in its way, one of the best films ever made. The set designs, the special effects, Alec Guinness, the story line -- Phantom Menace has none of these. Sure there are new worlds but they are bland and unoriginal. Sure there are special effects but they boring as well. And the script? I cant believe anyone tries to justify that mess. Earlier posts say its not shakespeare blah blah blah. No kidding its not shakspeare, but this movie makes the Matrix sound like shakespeare compared to the utter garbage presented here. There is no sense of wonder. Everything is stilted. Lucas cannot write. He does not know how to create characters. The movie was too long. Too boring. And then there is the Star Trek factor. The 'force' has been reduced to little bugs in your blood. What the hell? I dont really blame the actors since I dont think Lucas gave them a script or even decent direction to follow. Lastly, the excuse that Lucas geared this to a younger generation doesnt hold. Sure we are older now. So what. A good movie can appeal across age boundaries. Face it - Lucas has not directed anything good since the very first Star Wars. And that was in '77. Every artist loses it at some point.This movie is not OK. It is not pretty good. The Phantom Menace is the worst movie of all time.",Null,0,1,29 October 2001
