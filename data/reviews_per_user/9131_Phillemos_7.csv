The Longest Yard," Even Adam Sandler is a better QB than Sean Salisbury
","Never saw the original. But this remake with Adam Sandler and Chris Rock is entertaining enough to keep you enthralled. Sandler, of course, is a has-been quarterback who gets thrown in jail after leading police on a high-speed chase and being a little too cocky for his own good. Now he has to quarterback the prison team to victory over the guards. Probably one of the more entertaining things about this movie is that you watch all the ESPN lackeys and they're just as laughably pathetic as they are every Sunday in the fall. Michael Irvin acts like he still plays for the Cowboys dynasty and Sean Salisbury continues his 'I've got a know-it-all analyst gig at ESPN even though I was a journeyman NFL quarterback' shtick. There are a few twists to keep you interested. As a football fan who's never really been too into football movies, this one is probably one of the better ones.",7,0,2,17 September 2006
The Thing," Impressively time-tested
","'The Thing' has come a long way from being virtually ignored in the theaters in 1982 because it was released within two weeks of 'E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,' (I lobbied hard to see this instead, but my parents overruled me because I was 9 at the time and they felt 'E.T.' was just a LITTLE more age-appropriate) to making its way onto the IMDb Top 250 Movies of All-Time list. For that remarkable comeback alone, you have to give 'The Thing' and its resiliency some mad props. Myself, I ended up finally seeing this in the early 90s when I was in college. Definitely worth the wait. Its based on the old 1930s sci-fi novel 'Who Goes There?' and is essentially a remake of the 1950s 'The Thing From Another Planet.' Aside from being based on an old novel, it is derivative of many before it the sci-fi/monster movie genre. Think 'Alien' but in the Antarctic instead of outer space. But this movie still works on so many levels. First of all, it was one of the few movies in the late '70s/early '80s sci-fi genre that actually had a decent cast (such as Kurt Russell, Richard Dysart and that old geezer -- forgot his name -- who used to do Quaker Oats commercials and always mispronounced 'diabetes'). Secondly, the special effects are amazingly good for an '80s sci-fi movie; better than a lot of the crap that passes off as CGI special effects on SciFi Channel. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, this movie takes a somewhat complex plot (in addition to the 'monster runs amok' theme, there's quite a bit of plot and character buildup and mistrust amongst the main characters, weaved in with the 'in addition to fighting an unknown monster, we're kind of stuck in Antarctica too' claustrophobia) and does it without affecting the pace of the movie whatsoever. I guess that must be the John Carpenter influence. Whatever it is, this was a great movie to watch, giving you the sci-fi scares without any of the laugh-ability of bad, low-budget shockers. I'm shying away just a bit at giving it the highest possible rating because I wasn't 100% on board with the ending (leaves a little too much to interpretation of what happened to the final two survivors), but I give 'The Thing' a very solid 9.",9,0,1,25 November 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Wow, this guy just can't buy a break
","For all the potential hi-jinks involved in a movie about a 40-year-old who's never had sex, what really made this movie to me was the subtle humor. For example, the store manager who always has to play god-awful Michael McDonald music on all the TVs in the store, and the 'Age of Aquarius' spoof song at the end of the movie. Weave those nuggets into what we expect this film to be about, and you have a pretty good movie. Steve Carell is funny as usual, the supporting cast does exactly that -- supports all Carell's goofiness -- and while the main premise has the potential to devolve into locker-room humor, it never really does. If you've done at least a functional amount of dating in your life, you'll appreciate what total disasters some of these dates were. There were a few scenes I thought were a kind of lame (the chest-waxing scene comes to mind, though I realize a lot of people felt that was one of the best scenes in the movie). And I think the movie was about 20 minutes too long, but you can say that about 80% of all movies ever done. Overall, a solid 7.",7,0,0,29 August 2006
Alien vs. Predator," Freddy & Jason kick Alien & Predator's a**
","What made 'Freddy vs. Jason' an entertaining, if mindless, movie is that they cut to the chase and in about 90 seconds explained how Freddy and Jason got to the same place. The problem with 'Alien vs. Predator' is, it takes them about 90 minutes to do the same thing. Sure, there are some nice kills during the 90 minutes -- some woebegone expedition to the Antarctic stumbles upon the Predators and two-thirds of the crew don't make it to the movie's second hour. Some Aliens swing by to take care of most of the rest, and finally we have the sole survivor, Sanaa Lathan, teaming up with a weary Predator to kill the rest of the Aliens, including a Queen Bee Alien who's about the siz of a T-rex. In between there are a few chestburster scene -- you can't have an Alien movie with at least one, and a couple of those hideous-looking Predators taking their masks off (trust me, they wear those masks for a reason). I'm not going to lie, the movie could have been done better. You don't sympathize with ANY of the human characters; with the possible exception of Lathan, they're so dense that you're openly rooting for them to get killed. But there are enough kills that you can sit through it without being bored. And of course, the final scene leave the door open for 'Alien vs. Predator 2.' I give it a 4 out of 10.",4,0,1,15 April 2007
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Tyrannosaurus rex vs. San Diego
","Honestly, I would have been just as content if they had disposed of all the 'why-we-need-a-sequel' mumbo-jumbo and gone with the 'Tyrannosaurus rex escapes captivity and runs amok in San Diego' angle for the whole movie. I thought that was fascinating. Nevertheless, the movie was pretty good all the way around, particularly for a sequel. The Compsognathus scenes were a little hard to believe (even for a dinosaur movie). I just don't see a 2-foot-tall dinosaur having the ability to kill a man, even if it hunts in packs. But hey, Compsognathus needs love too. (OK, since I wrote this review 'Crocodile Hunter' Steve Irwin has been killed by a stingray, so I concede that anything's possible. But I don't see Compsognathus actively seeking out humans to kill when we're three times its size.) Every dinosaur movie should have a Stegosaurus cameo; I think that should be law. Most of the characters are a little bland; the Jeff Goldblum mathematician dude was probably the best of the bunch. But that's the only flaw in a pretty good sequel.",7,3,5,3 September 2006
This Is Spinal Tap," On the IMDb scale of 1 to 10, this movie GOES TO 11!!!!!
","On the strength of 82 minutes of footage that could have been done by a hand-held camcorder, 'This is Spinal Tap!' ranks as not only one of the best comedies ever, but also one of the best movies ever. In fact, since it rates an average of 7.9 out of nearly 29,000 votes, I'm not sure how it's not on the IMDb Top 250. Based on their own list, that should be more than enough for inclusion on the list. I'm hoping my efforts will help. Those that have been critical of this movie seem are missing the following points: 1) If the movie has not one but SEVERAL lines that have become widely used in mainstream culture, then like it or not it's a very influential movie. Once a day I hear someone (or myself) saying 'These go to 11,' 'Hello, Cleveland!!!' or 'I think that the problem may have been... that there was a Stonehenge monument on the stage that was in serious danger of being crushed... by a dwarf.' At least once every two minutes there is a quotable, HILARIOUS line. There is no other movie around that I hear quoted as frequently. 2) The satire of 'Spinal Tap' was pulled off so seamlessly, that everyone younger than 25 THINKS SPINAL TAP WAS A REAL BAND! 3) Since most of the youngsters have never seen 'Spinal Tap,' I have seen it quite a few times with people who have never seen it, and never has anyone NOT said it was one of the funniest movies they have ever seen. Those that love it could go on for 10,000 lines about how incredibly funny this movie is, but the best way to find out for yourself -- particularly since it's so short -- is to just watch it. You'll bust a gut laughing.",10,0,3,25 November 2006
Jurassic Park," More Velociraptors!!! More Tyrannosaurus rex!!!!!
","This is probably the best all-around dinosaur movie ever made. Yet I somehow feel the need to write about its flaws more than what was great about it. FLAWS: 1) You'd think a movie that invests so much into dinosaurs would get some basic facts straight. It's 'StegOsaurus,' not 'StegAsaurus' as it says on one of the DNA vials. And the Velociraptors are way bigger than they would have been in real life, the creatures in question are probably the much bigger Deinonychus, not Velociprator. Conversely, the Dilophosaurus is much smaller than it would have been in real life. If they had shown it real size, they wouldn't have had to concoct the 'spit-kill' scene. 2) The movie drags at times. Just stick with the dinosaurs-run-amok theme. We don't care about all the peripheral dinosaurs they show from time to time that have nothing to do with the movie. Great, there's a sick Triceratops lying in its own dung. You won't see him again, so why bother showing him in the first place? 3) When Dr. Neill, Jeff Goldblum and the kids are in their Jurassic Park-mobiles, they can sense the T-Rex coming from the vibrations and sounds of his footprints for about five minutes. Yet, when they're being attacked by the 'Velociraptors,' the T-Rex all of a sudden appears out of nowhere to save their a**. You couldn't hear T-Rex coming then? I would have liked to see a pack of five or six Velociraptors battle the T-Rex, just to make it more interesting. That said, this really is an entertaining movie. Among the characteristics that make this movie so good are: 1) The dinosaurs are first-rate, the best and most realistic ever. 2) Laura Dern's backside. We get to see her scale up and down walls to run away from dinosaurs all throughout the movie, and it's a wonderful sight. 3) All the lawyers get it in the end. Overall, they finally made a dinosaur movie that actually could receive critical acclaim. I give it an 8 out of 10.",8,2,4,3 September 2006
