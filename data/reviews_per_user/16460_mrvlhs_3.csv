Captain Phillips," Unconvincing story
","The story of how 5 (or 4?) untrained Somalian pirates went aboard a huge ship containing a large crew with nothing but a couple guns and their toy boat.Surprisingly enough, a big American vessel carrying several tons of goods through knowingly dangerous waters has no means of defence, be it security professionals, guns, safety axes or mere plumbing tools. Captain Phillips also miserably fails his attempts on shooting flares when the pirate boat is too far away, stopping at the second one, for no apparent reason. If you like unconvincing stories, this is truly a must see.I rated this movie 5 stars because there are a few lines here and there, Hanks did his best with the movie and the ending actually made me feel something. I'd only recommend this movie if you've already seen everything above 5 stars.",5,1,3,4 February 2014
Shutter Island," Well produced and directed, could have ended better
","I am not going to extend too much on this review. First of all, before you start taking my teeth out one by one, let me say I pretty much enjoyed the overall quality of the movie. From the shots, to the actors, lighting, sounds effects, music, all was at a very professional and captivating level. The plot was also very interesting as things started to, in a strange way, become simultaneously clearer and harder to understand.Now moving fast-forward: in my perspective the worst part of the movie was the end. I don't like open endings for a very simple reason: I payed for someone to figure it out for me. Else I would stay home and make my own movie in my mind. Anyway, if Martin wanted to leave an open ending he failed to do so. This means I didn't like it because of both things, 1st he tried, 2nd he failed, and now I'll explain why he failed: If the guy wasn't mental, why would anyone have all the trouble of making him believe he was? Why not simply doing the surgery to his brain right away? What would stop them from doing it? They could easily create an excuse.Oh I would also like to say something about many of other reviews are saying which is 'Martin created a new genre'. My response would be: 'Oh really? I also created this new thing, it looks like a camera, behaves like a camera and does all things a camera does, no more, no less, but it's called Parptrokypus and I invented it...'",8,0,3,26 February 2010
American Sniper," My intelligence was insulted
","The camera is on the sniper and he is following a woman in one direction. The camera shows the weapon's display and shows it moving in another. The gun sights and binoculars look like they were drawn on MS Paint. There's one gunman at some point holding a gun wobbling but the camera showing the sights shows them perfectly stable. At one moment he is holding his baby son which is clearly a toy baby. He kills a man with a shot 2km away without even seeing him (at least the cameras show he can not see anything). Ridiculous movie. Besides all these technical mistakes, which are not admissible in a war movie, it was, at most, OK. For the first time in my life I wanted to ask for my money back.",5,8,29,27 January 2015
