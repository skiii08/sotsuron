Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," More of the same stuff rolled into under 1.5 hours.
","I AM a Borat fan but this is pretty much the same type of humor he does with his smaller clips on Da Ali G Show. I did like the movie though. Scripted for over an hour's endurance, just think of some of his smaller clips with variances of Borat's humor rolled into one. The only real difference is that in the movie, he had a sidekick touring with him throughout the U.S. and A. Sascha Baron Cohen a.k.a. Borat/Ali G did a little better putting together his Ali G movie. New characters (plus more inside Ali G's character), gangsters, skits and an actual storyline is what made the movie. As for Borat? Come on Sascha. Put something together with a little more story and a little more shocking this time... I look forward to it.",6,0,5,6 November 2006
