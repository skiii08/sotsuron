The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The perks of being a wallflower is a surprisingly good movie
","I didn't expect much when I picked The perks of being a wallflower to watch. Casting was unknown for me except for adorable Emma Watson, who really makes a really good performance in the movie. For me the movie really reminded me of my high school years. First I thought that the movie was about a bullied kid and how he survives the American high school, but I was happily surprised how deep the movie really is. Its themes on sexuality, sex, social diversity and mental subjects gave me a real pleasure watching it. I could really see myself as Charlie bullying aside. This flick is an awesome, realistic, view on ones life. The movie sets on a short period, only one semester, but it really captures the viewers heart and focus. It was kind of a deep drama but I didn't feel sad during it, actually it made me kind of happy. It was nice to think back to my own high school years and my first love. I think many people can really identify themselves with the movie.In conclusion the movie is a brilliant classical movie, the main point is the story and how it's shown. It was like being in a theater, acting was mesmerizing and the story is just superb. Also remember to check out Crowded House's Don't dream it's over after the movie, just some brilliant music from the movie.",9,2,4,14 November 2013
