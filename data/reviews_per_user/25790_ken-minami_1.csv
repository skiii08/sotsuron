Resident Evil: Afterlife," A rip-off
","This movie is pretty much a rip-off of things already seen, that is Matrix / Matrix Revolutions (bullets in super slow motion / Bullet Time, the white room in which The Architect resides), the Axeman is Pyramid Head from Silent Hill and airplanes remind somewhat on Skynet from Terminator 3 and 4.Action scenes are well done, watching it in 3D might be worth the expense, but in my eyes is not enough to give it more then four stars. Plot does merely not exist, characters don't get very much explained except that Claire and Chris are siblings. If you are not fan of the series, don't bother.",4,0,2,10 April 2011
