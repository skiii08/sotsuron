The Blair Witch Project," Fresh and brilliant addition to horror genre
","This is not a movie that will make you jump in your seat - it will keep you up at night. In a genre where most of the films of its kind are based on a tired and exhausted formula, The Blair Witch Project gets past the usual equation to achieve something even greater - a true horror movie. This proves once again that a big budget movie with hundreds of digitalized special effects and a cast of $15 million stars is not necessary for a good movie. The only thing that keeps the movie lines long and the theaters packed with people who have seen the movie multiple time is a revolutionary and truly disturbing film (as in the horror genre) - this movie is just that. All too often the market is flooded with pseudo-horror films like 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,' 'Urban Legends,' and 'The Haunting.' Those movies go for the cheap, and short lived jolt. This movie will linger and out last its running time - probably until bed time.",10,1,2,25 July 1999
