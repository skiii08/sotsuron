Antz," Awesome
",Great movie indeed. I had a lot of fun watching it. I think Woody Allen's characterization was great. Worth seeing it.,10,0,0,23 December 1998
The Matrix Revolutions," Great Action and Special Effects, Dumb Story and Dialogues
","The first movie of the Matrix was a stroke of genius. The next two sequels, pretty much spoiled the first one.I expected this final movie to conclude with the story. Not even close. The ending left me pretty dissapointed.",7,0,0,6 November 2003
Jackie," Life of Jackie after Kennedy's assassination
","You would expect a movie like this to be the story about the life of Jackie Kennedy. Not at all, this movie is just about her life after Kennedy's assassination, very depressing most of the time. Although it's a strong movie that tries to make you feel her pain, sorrow and the magnitude of what she went through after those terrible events, at the end I got no substance or message out of this movie. Natalie Portman's portrayal was good, she must have worked really hard on researching and understanding this character, she imitated her really well including her accent but I felt no real emotions, empathy and she did not transmit her feelings that well to me.",3,1,1,17 March 2017
The Disaster Artist," What a piece of trash!
","Can't believe how bad this movie is, boredom to the highest levels. A bad movie portraying a true story about a bad movie, with no sense. no plot, no acting, just pure chaos and stupidity all movie long. I didn't see where Franco was funny or how this movie is about the pursue of dreams, is more about a mad man's stupidity.
Franco continues with his exaggerated overacted roles, found nothing funny or entertaining about this movie, can't believe I watched it til the end.",1,14,26,2 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Entertaining Movie but that's It
","Although Epidode VII is a very good standalone Star Wars movie, once again they do a terrible job of trying to make it fit with the previous movies. Return of the Jedi left me very happy with the way things ended, the Sith and the empire were vanquished, Leia and Han lived happily ever after, Luke was a consummate Jedi and he turned Vader back to the light side of the force before dying.This new chapter pretty much destroys all of that in trying to continue the story. Episode VII begins with chapter IV all over again, copying many aspects of the original story. It's the rebels against a new empire again now called The First Order (with a silly emperor called Supreme Leader Snoke), a new pet droid where they once again hide the maps of something valuable to the rebellion, another masked villain with an intimidating voice, another death star, X Wings again flying inside a ditch requiring precise shots to destroy it, etc, nothing new.The production again fail to see what made the original trilogy so great was that it touched the hearts of all of us who grew up watching the movies, it had great characters and a beautiful story that teached many wonderful human values. Maybe Lucas believes that what makes the movies great are the special effects, monsters, cool lightsabres, ships, robots, etc.So overall, It was an entertaining movie that made a terrible job of continuing with the Star Wars legacy.",6,5,11,21 December 2015
Green Book," One of the best movies I have ever seen
","This movie has it all, I laughed, I was touched emotionally, It left me with a great feeling of how two completely different persons in every way become the best of friends. Both acting performances are masterpieces. I liked every minute of this film and it thaught me a lot of things about humanity.
To me it was a must see movie in my all time favourite movie list.",10,1,3,11 March 2019
Annihilation," What a boring slow piece of garbage
","This is the kind of movie that extremely slow, bogus, no logical succession of events, depressing, dark type of movie.
Natalie Portman's character is always depressed and nothing never really happens. Just an incoherent series of events.
Not even worth trying to figure out what the director meant, just avoid this movie at all costs and save yourself 2 hours of boredom.",1,13,26,10 July 2018
