The Blair Witch Project," Not scary, but interesting
","I'm beginning to believe there is a dividing line between those who liked TBWP and those who didn't that is often based on age. The post-25-year-olds seem to, for the most part, view the film as so-so and not scary. Many of the under-25 viewers like it very much and find it innovative and terrifying.I'm over 25, so you can guess where I fall on that continuum. Blair Witch was interesting primarily as a study of three people freaking out, not as a horror movie. Much has been written about the low budget and primitive technique. Yes, it is primitive, and that adds a certain mystique. It is like watching old home movies. It's so bad it is interesting to see how the filmakers will get a story across with so little apparent ability to do so. But to me, that isn't a point of contention. The quality of the film technique is what it is.The story itself is basic. Three young film students set out to do a documentary about a ghost legend. You don't learn much about the students beforehand, and they have little depth. Most of what you learn comes from watching the group dynamics of the threesome as their situation gets worse and each individual starts to break down. From that perspective, TBWP was interesting. It also gets very annoying, as they begin to yell at each other and become irrational over what appears to be simply noises in the woods and some related odd goings on.The lack of reasonable behavior by the threesome is what ultimately turned me off. I'll avoid giving away too much here, but will state a two examples:1. When the students become lost and lose the map, they show very little ability to reason out an escape route based on the direction of the creek and the position (east - west) of the sun. If they had a map before, and saw the creek on it, and then find the creek, how hard can it be to follow the creek in a direction that gets them to safety? Can't they remember what was on the map, at least the basics?2. The film lost all believability when the filmakers, especially the female star, continued to shoot video of what were supposed to be horrifying and sudden developments. I could see taping *after* the developments, when a little time had passed for the students to adjust. But *during*? I don't know about you, but if I find bloody remains the last thing I am doing as I find them is filming, and zooming in and out on them while also screaming my head off. That was the problem. How could a person be calm enough to film something frightening, while at the same time screaming and generally losing it in fear? It is hard to believe that one person is doing both simultaneously. And every time that happened, I remembered I was watching a movie, and these people weren't real, and anything that happened wasn't scary. I suppose if the camera were a small, helmet-mounted unit that taped automatically it would have worked better. But just a little.In the end, The Blair Witch Project was interesting but certainly not worth the hype. I wonder how many people have homemade 'story' videos in their tape collections that include plots of the same quality? Probably a lot.",5,0,2,30 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing lack of originality
","Star Wars fanatics won't like this opinion. I'm a life-long sci-fi fan and was extremely disappointed in The Phantom Menace. It does include nifty digital effects, and perhaps that was Lucas' primary goal. But as I sat watching the movie, it didn't take long (opening credits and scene, actually), before I started asking, 'Haven't we done this all before?'The similarities between the plot of the Phantom Menace and the plot of Star Wars and Empire are many. I will only name a few here, and I will try to do it without spoiling anything for readers who have not yet watched the movie: queen/princess in trouble; Tattoine kid who wants a new life; need to obtain a ship to leave Tattoine; death of Jedi teacher at hands of symbol of Dark Side; ship needing to 'thread the needle' to blow up bigger ship; ending victory celebration/ceremony. And those are just a FEW examples.Worse, perhaps, than the similarities (after all, Lucas had to return us to the Star Wars universe and there will be similarities) was the utter lack of imagination in creating the aliens. That's right, LACK of imagination. Look at it this way: If you had to come up with a villain who was more evil than Darth Vader (a great villain, IMO), then what would be the most stereotypical concept you could create? Can you say, 'SATAN!' Darth Maul looks like the devil. Big deal. Where is the creativity in that?Want more? Consider the various aliens. There has been a minor stir over the accents and appearance of aliens such as JarJar (the 'Rasta), the trade reps (WWII 'yellow menace' Japanese voices) and the junk shop owner (crusty Jewish dealer). This flap could have been avoided if the aliens just acted, well, ALIEN! Why did Lucas give aliens Earth-based accents? Couldn't he have come up with something original that caused the viewer to think, 'Wow! Look at that! THAT is an alien!'One digital scene that has been praised by some is the pod race. For me, this was the most boring scene in the movie. Why? Because you KNEW the outcome. It was predictable. If the outcome of the race had been different, and the ship had then found a new, surprising way to get off the planet, THAT would have been some imagination. As it was, it was a waste of 5-10 minutes while you waited for the inevitable.I won't even get into acting (often wooden), the annoying JarJar, the misuse of characters (Darth Maul was on screen for what, 5 minutes? And HE was supposed to be the tool of the Dark Side?) or other plot holes. And what is the big 'mystery' over Darth Sidius? We know that the Emporer Palpatine is in the future. So who do you think Sidious is? Is there a senator named Palpatine? Why, yes, I guess there is. So where is the mystery?Phantom Menace, in my opinion, is Disneyesque. It is big on hype and marketing and very short on plot and story. That's sad, when you consider what the original Star Wars trilogy was. But that was 20 years ago. This is a different culture, and Phantom fits right in .. shallow, glitzy and satisfying only to those with a short attention span and few critical thinking skills.",2,0,1,22 June 1999
The Sound of Music," I don't get it; THIS is a classic?
","I don't want to rain on anyone's parade here. I know TSOM is alleged to be one of the greatest musicals ever. That's why I (finally) watched it last week on DVD with my wife, who is a huge TSOM fan. Now that I have seen it, I don't get it. I admit up front that I have never been a big fan of musicals. When I was a kid and a song broke out in a cartoon, I usually lost interest. That hasn't changed.But even allowing for that, *this* is a classic film beloved by millions? Why? I mean, the setting is gorgeous, granted. And the actors do OK. But the plot, the pacing, even the music ... is this any better than most other musicals?My DVD player said this movie was almost three hours long. But *nothing happens* until you've watched it for 2 hours and 23 minutes (that's when the Nazi threat comes in). Until that point, here is the plot (and I don't think this is a spoiler for anyone, though maybe some people who haven't seen TSOM, like me until last week, might expect more): Former war captain who lives in inexplicably huge house in Austria with his seven kids and no wife meets former nun who starts as nanny and they fall in love and get married. That's it! More than two hours of kids singing, the nanny singing, the kids and nanny singing while they play, and increasingly loving looks and conversations between the captain and the nanny (though few of them compared to the singing). This plot could have occurred in less than an hour. There is very little original, or new, it. It is very, very slow. There is a minor B plot about a rich woman the captain is engaged to who bows to the inevitable and agrees to end the engagement. But that's all.There is no conflict (which most stories revolve around) until 2 hours and 23 minutes in, when the local townspeople who join the Nazis make a move. Then, when it gets interesting, the movie ends in less than 30 minutes after that point! Amazing! It ended with the family cresting a mountain and I said out loud, 'That is IT?!' I expected much more. Watching a movie with no conflict (and the relationship between the nanny and the captain is hardly a conflict) is like idly following a river's current, with no destination in mind. If you like that kind of aimlessness, great. But if you want something that will hold your interest, and you don't enjoy aimless wandering, then TSOM isn't for you.Also, I thought the musical was amateurish in scenes that required background music. About 90 percent of the time, when two actors were having a discussion and music played in the background, that music was the melodies from various songs used elsewhere in the movie, one after another! So you are watching what is supposed to be a touching scene between the captain and the nanny outside at night, and under the dialogue is 'The hills are alive, with the sound of muuuuuuuusiiiiccccc!' and 'Edel-weisssss, Edel-weissssssss,' and other tunes over and over. It was *extremely* distracting. I kept trying to listen to the dialogue but my mind was filling in the words to the melodies underneath it. Couldn't the film have used the same notes as background music but dropped the melodies? It seemed very odd. I can't remember ever hearing that before in a movie, or being so distracted by it.I'm puzzled by this love for TSOM. So many people care for this film, there must be *something* to it. But I'm not sure what it is. I do know that the people I know who like TSOM are all women. Most of my male friends haven't even seen it (other than snippets on TV now and then). Maybe it's a gender thing. In any case, I gave TSOM a 5. Don't shoot me!",5,4,16,7 September 2000
Friday Night Lights," Decent for what it is, bit no new ground broken here
","Ever watched a movie that was technically very good, with fine performances by the actors, but which contained no surprise and even was filled with plot twists you just knew were coming? That's Friday Night Lights.The movie is put together well. Billy Bob Thornton is very good, as are most of the other actors. There is some confusion that isn't explained when the football team does well or poorly with and without a key player ... is the movie saying that at first the team struggled, but then grew as a team and later was better without him? It isn't clear. But otherwise, everything moves along pretty well.Minor spoilers - The problem is, we have all seen this before. Small town in which many adult residents overly focus on the local high school football team. Players under intense pressure as a result. Coach who faces comments everywhere he goes about how the team is doing or will do. Even a father trying to relive his life through his son. It has all been done. Nothing in this movie was a surprise. There is a mild one at the end to avoid total cliché.I expected the movie to be stronger, but instead I felt like I was watching the son of 'All the Right Moves' or cousin of 'Radio.' We gave it a 6.",6,4,6,16 March 2005
Meet the Parents," Stupid characters, inexplicable actions, a few laughs
","I'm one of those people who have to see a sort of logic in a movie character's behavior to fully enjoy any resulting comedy. If a character takes a wrong turn somewhere and tries to get back on course but in the process takes an even more wrong turn and fun ensues, that's fine. But if a character gets lost and instead of trying to turn back decides to set his pants on fire or run over someone sitting on a park bench for no apparent reason, that is not funny to me. That's why I rated Meet the Parents a 5.The main character, played by Ben Stiller, lies for no reason and then gets caught in his lies and makes them worse. He takes actions that he isn't supposed to and has been warned not to do then lies when he is asked if he did so and blames something (a cat) else. And when Greg tries to find the missing cat, he quickly stoops low enough to paint a different cat's tail and try to pass it off as the missing feline (why no one notices the paint smell until later that night, and then they do, is a mystery).  The guy isn't especially likeable and you keep wanting to slap him and say, 'Just tell the truth! It works!'Meanwhile, his girlfriend expects Ben (called 'Greg' in the movie) to instantaneously act like he is a member of a family he has never met. When Greg needs clothes, his girlfriend tells him to wake up her brother -- whom Greg has never met and whose bedroom door is closed while the brother is apparently asleep -- and borrow some of his. Uh, not a good idea. Later, his girlfriend drops little bomblets on Greg, such as the fact that the best man at a family wedding is her ex-finacee (by the way, Greg never even knew that his girlfriend had been engaged), or that the dad had a different career than what she had told Greg earlier.All in all this group of characters spends a lot of time cleaning up messes that would have been easily avoided if a little truthful communication had taken place beforehand. It is that fact that kept me from enjoying any of the contrived situations that ensued. In fact, to me the funniest part of this movie was an airline gate agent who acts like, well, an airline gate agent, regardless of the actual situation around her. *That* was not contrived at all and was laugh out loud funny.",5,1,2,2 May 2001
Unbreakable," More cerebral, yet somehow lacking
","I was never especially impressed with The Sixth Sense. The big 'surprise' was apparent to me after one or two scenes where I noticed that no one except the child paid any attention to Bruce Willis' character, even when he apparently touched them.So I viewed Unbreakable with some mild cynicism. A surprise ending, I heard. Oh boy.I was pleasantly surprised myself to realize as the movie unfolded that this was a thinking person's movie. There is a little action, sure. But the real issues have to do with why the two main characters are who they are. I don't just mean they are the 'good guy' and 'bad guy,' either. Why are they unique, yet only one seems aware of it? Why is the 'evil' one so interested in finding the 'good' one and showing him his abilities? And what exactly ARE the unique abilities each side has? And is there some cosmic purpose involved?My wife was frustrated with the movie's slow pace. I wasn't, because it gave me time to sort out what the movie was telling the viewer about the characters and their motivations. The acting is very good. Bruce Willis is much more than a one-note actor, and Samual Jackson is simply a good actor, period.My one disappointment was, of course, the ending. SPOILERS AHEAD! While I found it hard to believe that a guy would never notice his amazing ability to be invulnerable and stronger than others, or, if he did notice, to essentially hide it from everyone, I was even more skeptical of a bad guy who, I guess, apparently causes random accidents that kill hundreds of people in an attempt to find the hero. OK, do you know how long this could take, and how many people would die? What if the hero was in Nepal? And yet this super smart, clever bad guy just starts his trail of accidents in the US? Is he just nuts? Surely someone would eventually catch him. Besides, if the movie really wanted to make the ending a shocker, it would have tied the evil guy to accidents that have happened in the REAL world, not in the movie. That would have got you thinking.Still, when all is said and done, I enjoyed the concepts in Unbreakable. I hope if there is a sequel, we see some logical growth here and not simply 'surprises' for the sake of surprise. I gave it a 7.",7,0,0,1 August 2001
The 13th Warrior," You'll ask 'why?' a lot
","We had high hopes for this movie. They were in vain. This is a classic example of a movie that had almost no thought put into its plot. It is a series of fights, interrupted from time to time with scenes of dialogue that raise more questions than they answer.The 13th Warrior begins with a scene of Ambassador Ahmet (who existed in real life) headed north after being sent away so he won't fool around with the king's wife. He and his small retinue bump into a passing Viking gang, and for reasons never explained Ahmet must join a band of 13 Vikings in a mission to help a semi-feudal village that is under attack. Even more odd is Ahmet's decision to join the Vikings. He already has a mission, and doesn't seem to be under any duress. Even a throw-away line along the lines of, 'I decided to go, so I could learn more about these North People who I will need to understand as ambassador' would have helped. Along the way Ahmet learns how to speak the Viking language by, apparently, watching the Vikings talk. Never are we shown a Viking saying a word and tying it to an item, so that an observer might be able to attach meaning to the words. Yet somehow our hero learns the language. What are the odds of that?At this point The 13th Warrior becomes a sort of a Viking 'Seven Samauri,' with our Viking heroes gathering the village people (the serfs, not the disco group, though if *those* Village People appeared it would not have surprised me) to defend the town against a band of cannibals who are (again) never fully explained.During the ensuring battle scenes, there is an attempt to show a juxtaposition between the culture of Ahmet the Muslum and Rennaisance Man and that of the crude but effective Vikings. For example, Ahmet has trouble wielding a Viking broadsword but once he has a curved scimitar made to order he is ready to rock (of course, later, when the band sorties on a mission to attack the cannibals, Ahmet has a Viking broadsword tied to his back and the scimitar is nowhere in sight). Also, just before a big battle, Ahmet suddenly drops to his knees to pray as Muslins do five times a day (though we never see him do it at any other time). Anyway, you can *almost* feel the threads of a plot here revolving around Ahmet as an observer of another culture, but it never is clear nor develops (just like the rest of the movie).There are many instances where events make no sense. The cannibal tribe at one point early on seem to have kicked the Vikings' butts and are burning the village, then withdraw at the sound of a horn for no apparent reason. It just means they have to attack again later, after the village has time to recover a bit. There also seems to be some voodoo involved in that the Vikings (and Ahmet, for a little while) don't know if the cannibals are men or spirits. It's unclear why there is any doubt, since the cannibals look like guys with animal headdresses and fall when they are stabbed. And throughout the movie it appears that the odds are something like 20 or 30 to 1 against the Vikings (and the cannibals are on horses!), yet somehow we have a happy ending.The movie *tries* to draw on a theme of honor and courage. The Viking leader is noble and fights until he can no longer fight. But that theme is underminded by the numerous ploy holes. Why should we care about these people and what they fight for? Why are there only 13? Why do the cannibals attack? How did this start? Without answers to basic questions (and no clear indication of a moral cause), the idea of honor falls flat.I cannot believe the average rating for this movie is 6.2. We gave it a 2.",2,11,27,1 May 2000
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fun to watch, but too long and lacks purpose
","Pirates certainly was interesting. In fact, some of the droll, dark humor was very unDisney-like (and enjoyably so). But the movie ran about two hours, and would have been better at 90 minutes. Much of it involved sword fights and plot twists that didn't add much. The plot was like a thread that would be dropped for 10 minutes, then picked up again. Johnny Depp was superb. What a strange character he created. It begged the question, though, of how this goof could have lived more than 20 minutes as a pirate. Finally, and a minor spoiler. if you end up cursed for stealing Cortez's gold, didn't the governor's daughter steal the gold from the unconscious boy? Just wondering. A good movie, which is a step in the right direction for Disney, but undisciplined and meandering. We gave it a 6.",6,2,4,20 October 2003
Alexander," Laughable
","Alexander was closer to Clash of the Titans than any of Oliver Stone's typical films. Casting, acting, editing ... they were all sub par. Colin Farrell wasn't at all convincing as Alexander. He seemed more like a child demanding attention than an emperor to be. Angelina Jolie sounded like Morticia (was that her name?) from Rocky and Bullwinkle. Her scheming was mildly interesting, but each time she spoke it was hard not to laugh. In fact, it was hard not to laugh throughout the film, but more importantly, it was hard to be drawn into the film when every actor seemed like they were playing pretend. I always wonder when I see a movie this bad whether the actors knew it while they were making it. I get a sense they might have had an inkling early on. Something went wrong with this production, and it showed up on film. We gave it a 4.",4,4,6,18 January 2006
Chicken Run," A for effort, but 6 to 7 for rating
","Chicken Run is a refreshing change of pace visually. And it doesn't take long to get past the clay-mation-like figures and see them as characters, not special effects. Where Chicken Run fell short was character development. While a few of the chickens had some personality, all of them (with the exception of Ginger) were so one-dimensional that really, if they didn't escape from the farm, it would have been OK with me.Now, I realize how ridiculous it is to discuss character development for clay chickens. To be honest, I'm having trouble choosing the right words here. But when I left Chicken Run I felt right off that the movie had missed a chance to be an instant classic, and I have been pondering why.It certainly isn't the special effects. They were interesting, almost endearing in their three-dimensional reality vs. the pathetic ( in my opinion) Pokeman-level animation that seems to be in vogue today.
It isn't the plot, which was cute and serious (deadly serious) at the same time. The chickens must escape or die. And the always dreaming Ginger keeps things moving with her constant attempts to escape and find someplace better for not just herself, but for the other chickens. So what felt empty? To me, it was the character of the chickens themselves. Now, chickens don't have much depth, I know. But these were movie characters! They should pop out, make you identify with them even if they are clay chickens! But only Ginger (and the effectively profit-hungry and evil Mrs. Tweedle) created a presence. The other chickens has a one-dimensional personality that quickly grew predictable and tiresome.For example, take the 'stupid chicken' (I can't believe I am writing this). I forget her name ... Henrietta? She is always knitting and completely missing the point of anything. She never changed. Or take the old war veteran rooster. He is pompous and a bit lost and never changes, either. Even Rocky the rooster changed only in the most cliched of all ways ... coming back from his freedom to help Ginger and her pals escape. If any of these characters had shown some growth, it would have made for a better movie. It also could have used some funnier lines, though the general lack of pop culture jokes (oh sure, there were a few Star Trek lines) was a relief.One other thing stuck out rather jarringly at the end. Without giving the plot away, Ginger seems surprised that the retired war veteran rooster can't fly a plane. Uh, he is a rooster. Ginger seems perfectly aware that human society is a bird of a different feather (a-hem) and has never seen a rooster or chicken fly anything. She's too smart to be blind as to believe that roosters flew human planes. That seemed weird to me.Still, despite the predictable ending, Chicken Run was fun (well, the second half was much more lively than the first half; about 30 minutes into a 1:10 p.m. show my wife fell asleep) and so different than anything now out there. It also had a noble message about dreaming and improving ones life. Best of all, it wasn't Disney. For that reason alone, go see it.",7,0,0,26 June 2000
X-Men," Pleasant surprise
","I haven't read a comic book in 10 years, but I did see a few eps of the X-Men cartoon TV show that was so popular 4-5 years ago. I was surprised then at how serious that cartoon was, and that it was in serial form with each episode building on past episodes. Pretty adult stuff for a TV cartoon.That is the same way I felt after seeing the X-Men movie. It was dark, serious (there were maybe two laughs, including one big one), and -- best of all -- interesting. I expected the movie to end up somehow 'kiddie-fied,' with lots of things that made little sense and many cheap laughs and stupid one-liners. Boy, was I surprised.X-Men looks like a terrific start to a movie franchise. The characters were all believeable (well, they are mutants, so you have to buy into the premise). The technology was interesting and not too futuristic. The actors ranged from excellent (Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen, and the guy who played Wolverine did a great job, too) to passable (Halle Barry, Sabertooth). Some characters didn't say much (Toad, Mystique). The plot made sense, mostly. We only nitpicked a few things afterward.The core of the movie, which sets up the 'good' and 'bad' sides, is believable and thought-provoking. How *would* our society react if we found that certain individuals were genetically different and had exceptional powers? Would we embrace them or lock them up? I hope the X-Men movies keep up what this first one started. I would love to have seen the additional 45 minutes that were supposedly cut from the movie. The information was interesting enough to support showing it. If I have one criticism, it is that the movie was a bit slow in the first 45 minutes, because the characters had to be set up and brought in. But that was a price I was willing to pay.Check out X-Men. It is better than you think it will be.",7,0,0,24 July 2000
Lost in Translation," A very good to great film; if you don't like it, you don't get it
","To view Lost in Translation with enough depth to understand it, you have to have some depth yourself. That isn't meant as an insult. In college I took a creative writing class (at the time I wanted to be a writer and I was pretty good, technically) and wrote several short stories as part of the class. After the instructor read three or four of these, he called me aside to talk about my writing and said this: 'You know what you need? You need to fail.' I was shocked and insulted, but for years wondered about what he said and why he said it. Now, 20 years later, I am sure I know what he meant. He meant that my life had been a pretty good one, with few disappointments, and as a result I didn't have the depth to write something truly emotional and meaningful, yet, no matter how good I was technically. I became a journalist.The same is true for Lost in Translation. These user reviews which call the movie boring are missing out, probably through no fault of the reviewer. If you have never been isolated in a truly foreign environment (I have, in China, among others), or have never truly wondered whether the path you are beginning or ending was the right one (including marriage or career choices), and have never met up with a stranger who seemed to 'get' you even though you both know back home you probably wouldn't even have talked, then this movie will probably seem dull.To me, it was a moving story about two people who connect briefly but not in the lame Hollywood sexual manner. These people talk, and observe and wonder out loud. And when they part, they are sad beyond all normal expectation.
Lost in Translation had one scene -- involving kareoke -- that I thought went on too long. But everything else was almost perfect. To have people speak in Japanese, often with no translation, drives home the isolation one feels in that environment if you are not Japanese. To see Charlotte pace, and sit, and be bored, shows what happens when you are alone in a strange place with no agenda. I've been there. It is EXACTLY like this.
I think I heard the second half of what Bill Murray whispers at the end. If I did, I liked it. SPOILER ALERT: It sounded like he said, 'No matter what happens, tell the truth.'If he did, that phrase has meaning on several levels, just like the movie. What a great film. I gave it a 9.",9,0,0,9 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Phantom Menace, Still Empty
","Attack of the Clones seems almost like a response from the reclusive George Lucas to the many critics of Phantom Menace. It is as if he thought, 'They dared to be critical of Phantom Menace, did they? Well, take THIS!'Attack of the Clones has so much action (after a fairly long set up), it just becomes too much. The viewer already suffers from the lack of any connection to the characters (unlike in the original Star Wars). Add to that way too much visual overkill and you are left numb.Sometimes numb is a good thing in a movie. Being numb from seeing amazingly creative scenes, or sudden plot twists you never expected, that's good. Unfortunately for Lucas and the quality of this new Star Wars trilogy, numb isn't from that. The fact that the next three 'episodes' have already been made and been around for 20 years takes away from any real interest in what happens next or plot twists. After all, we already know what happens next to every major character, and we can guess at some minor ones (anyone here the name 'Organa' in Attack of the Clones?).No, numb in this instance is from loud noise and so many visual effects you can barely keep the action straight. Then you are left with odd questions like, why does Yoda hide his true ability (even using a cane)? And why didn't he throw the levitating column at the bad guy's escape ship, not harmlessly to the floor (sorry, trying to avoid spoilers here)? And doesn't he look when he fights like some escapee from the Muppet Show in a sugar frenzy?Interestingly, I thought the most creative and involving piece of the film was the visit to the 'clone water world.' It also is the portion that seems least like the rest of the movie, and least like Lucas (it was more Spielbergesque). I wonder if Lucas actually had a hand in that segment or if someone else was responsible. In a way, Clones is a reflection of our society today. Less characterization, less emotional involvement, more loud things and more shiny things. Kids today don't know what they missed (I'm 38). For instance, if Annakin had, in Clones, performed some amazing feat (powered by his emotion) that saved the Jedi and showed that he could indeed become the greatest of all, then his fall would be that much more melancholy, because we would know how good he could have been. Instead, he is picked on so much in Clones that you never feel he is much better than an average Jedi and that's all he will be. Too bad. Lucas misses a chance to put a real plot point in the story.Overall, I rated Clones a 6. That's better than the 3 I gave Phantom Menace. If the next movie is an 8, then we will be back where the original Star Wars started.",6,0,0,28 May 2002
Radio," Too sweet, too slow, fairly predictable and little sense at the end
","Radio has some very good actors giving good performances. Its flaw is its story.Once the movie introduces us to its main characters, it never really settles on the bad guys to provide us with conflict. Oh, for a brief while one of the football players is mean to Radio, but he learns better. And a big booster doesn't like Radio being around the school's teams, but he never really tries very hard to do much to Radio. The coach's daughter feels abandoned by her dad (who takes such a strong interest in radio). But she never really protests much. Even the school board representative pretty much makes a reasonable case for his interest. And none of the football or basketball games seem to lead to anything. There is no build up or sense of greater purpose.After a while, you start to wonder where the movie is headed, because there is not really much conflict happening. And when it does end, you are left saying, 'Huh What?' [MINOR SPOILERS] When something happens to Radio's mom, who takes care of Radio? He apparently doesn't come home with the coach. Is it Radio's brother? Why don't we see him? And when the coach makes his surprise announcement, does this lead to adopting Radio? If not, what was the point of the announcement? There is one strong moment, when the coach tells his daughter about an incident from his childhood that helps explain why he is so interested in Radio. Other than that, this movie is so calm as to be comatose. The acting raised my rating to a 6.",6,0,0,13 August 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Disappointing; Shocking Lack of Originality
","If you want to see T3, just watch T2 again and then add on five minutes worth of plot mythology development. Basically, T3 seems to exist to make money, instead of make money and take us meaningfully forward in the Terminator franchise. Let's see ... Terminator sent back in time to kill John Connor (and a few others, given lip service but no meaning)? Check. Other Terminator (older model) sent back to protect Connor? Check. War between humans and self-aware machines coming? Check. Car chases involving big, destructive trucks? Check. Bar scene where naked Terminator gets clothes? Check. Organization that will unwittingly allow self-aware machines to control nuclear weapons? Check.I mean, what was new? Very little. A minor philosophy change involving fate (Sarah Connor turns out to be wrong after all). A very brief bit of reprogramming that causes a good guy to be a bad guy for a few minutes. Even the fancy new Terminator is very similar to the new one in T2. It has an additional weapons ability and one minor wrinkle where it can control machines, but really, who ever thought a Terminator couldn't do that?That's just the beginning. This movie raises many questions about its own story. For instance, if it is so easy for the machines and humans to send machines back in time, how can this ever end? Why not send a Terminator back to 1961 and kill Sarah Connor as a child? Or kill her parents back in 1930? The franchise really needs to point out that this process is terribly difficult and limited.Also, John Connor knows how he will die. So now that he knows, why can't he prevent it? It's not like it is a random bomb. There is a very specific set of actions that must occur for Connor to die, and Connor himself must OK one of them. So why would he ever do it?T3 is very disappointing, and one of the most crass cash grabs I have ever seen from Hollywood.",6,0,0,28 July 2003
Being John Malkovich," Interesting idea, but messy and uninteresting afterward
","The idea of entering someone else's brain for 15 minutes is interesting. The fact that after those 15 minutes you are inexplicably dropped by the New Jersey turnpike is funny just because, well, it's silly. And the fact that the brain you enter is John Malkovich is different, if nothing else.But once you get used to those concepts, and the existence of a floor in a building that is 60 percent the size of a normal floor (to save on rent costs), then you are left with ... time to kill.I looked forward to seeing BJM, and for the first 25 minutes I was entertained. But then the surprises stopped coming. Instead, we see more and more odd and generally uninteresting events, concerning characters who are not likeable and whose motives are selfish and at times vague. The last hour of the movie I kept glancing at my watch, wondering when it would be over.Kudos to John Malkovich for being willing to play this role (though who wouldn't want a film with your name in it?). And I have to say I didn't even recognize Cameron Diaz. Cusack is fine, as is the actress who plays Maxine. But they are all characters who are hard to like or care about, and after you see the film's main hook there isn't much else to do except wait out the conclusion.I gave BJM a 5.",5,2,5,18 September 2000
Remember the Titans," More like Clash of the Titanic Cliches
","Finally saw Remember the Titams on pay-per-view. Rated it a 5. RTT is a curious mixture of two basic stories: the integration of a high school in Northern Virginia in 1971, and the integration of that school's football team.The 'big picture' story, of racial integration as a social issue, is painted shallowly. We see glimpses of protest and white people who resist the integration (the African Americans seem bemused by it). But we never really get a feel for how hot an issue this is elsewhere. In truth, the movie makes Alexandria appear bigoted and racist. That's curious to me, because I grew up about 10 miles south of Alexandria and don't recall any of this. Alexandria is a D.C. suburb (more of a feeder community). D.C. is extremely integrated. I would think Alexandria would be more likely to be accepting when the change came. Now if the school had been in SOUTHERN Virginia, that's a different story ....The 'small picture' story, of the players on the team (and the two coaches) integrating, is filled with cliches. There is forced bonding and unnaturally quick progress. None of it feels very real. Neither does the football, which is almost incoherent in its speed and flash through games. Never do you feel like the Titans are facing any particular dramatic moment. You just assume they will win, and don't worry about it.For a movie with such ambition, Remember The Titans is more pretentious than anything. It reached high and never actuall got off the ground.",5,0,0,2 July 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Um, uh, well, it was good, but ...
","While I enjoy the occasional 'foreign film' (foreign in my reality is either not American or not in English), I tend to be suspicious of those that arrive with tremendously high praise. I rarely find them as good as the billing. I think for some reason foreign films tend to be overindulged by reviewers. My pet theory is that English-speaking reviewers see a foreign film and are so happy to be able to follow it, the reviews suddenly are out of sight.With that comment setting the stage, I believe Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was beautifully filmed, and had a plot that mostly made sense. Still, I have to say that the 'flying ninja' scenes were silly, and there must have been some concepts that didn't translate in my Western mind because I didn't understand the ending at all (even if I speculate, it seems like such a waste).Now, now. I know the flying ninjas were graceful. And the fight in the treetops was daring. But I can only suspend reality so much. OK, fine, so this was a fantasy film, I guess. But even as a fantasy it looked silly. Why did they keep churning their legs as they flew? Wouldn't it make more sense to simply leap with straight or flexed legs and keep the air drag down? Why not windmill their arms and wear capes while they are at it? Where do you stop?The fight scenes were terrific overall, and not too repetitive. I've never liked martial arts movies because I could make no sense of a fight when five blows seem to have no effect, but 15 seconds later one blow of the same type knocks out an opponent. In CTHD, the fights take place in different settings and for different reasons, and don't feature wave after wave of faceless opponents who go down after taking 25-30 blows each. That was a nice surprise. The plot felt like an epic, moving back and forth in time to fill in back stories on characters. And it had one of the best plot devices of all, revenge and retribution.Still, the ending, while dramatic, seemed senseless. If a person grows through sadness and mistakes, in the Western world they become a better person (though the hard way). If they do what Jen finally did in CTHD, that is considered a coward's way out. But I suppose in the East, that takes courage. I dunno.Anyway, I gave CTHD an 8, because of the settings, for its epic story and because of a truly hilarious line about one man's home being a 'warehouse.'",8,0,0,19 February 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Too much style (and slo mo!), not enough substance
","I dare anyone out there to watch this film and count how many times director John Woo uses slow motion. About 20 minutes into the movie I was gripping my seat armrests in frustration, muttering under my breath, 'GET. ON. WITH. THE. SCENE!' It is rare that I notice consciously any particular technique used by a filmaker, but in this case I felt like I was being smacked over the head with a scene from 'The Six Million Dollar Man' over and over and over.Unlike at least one reviewer, I was very impressed with the female lead and her character. Sure, she was predictable, but I did not see her so much as a damsel in distress as I saw her as a woman who knew when to play it cool and when to take action. Tom Cruise was, well, Tom Cruise.
The plot? I read in an article a comment from Cruise that this movie concentrates more on Ethan Hawk's feelings and humanity than the convoluted (yet somehow entertaining because of its nearly unfathomable plot) MI: 1. Yes, it does do that. But it makes for a cliched, lurching plot, rather than an intriguing one. We are supposed to believe that Hawk, the consummate professional, falls in love with a woman because she drives almost as well as he does? Because she is a hottie? Because she has the nerve to be a thief? If Hawk did that, he would have been killed by some female spy or other by now. We needed something special, something unique, that pulled Hawk to the thief. But we never get it.The rest of the movie depends on his feelings for her. And it is hard to tell whether his crush makes him a better or worse spy. But we go along as lots of things blow up real good.I suppose in the end, what most bothered me about MI:2 was the boring plot. I expected more from a movie with the reputation of Mission Impossible. Instead, it seemed dumbed down in favor of style. I know, maybe Americans want that today. I guess I'm an exception. I gave MI:2 a 5.",5,0,0,19 June 2000
A Bug's Life," OK, but clearly for kids
","Finally saw this movie on DVD. I enjoyed Antz more, primarily because it had more of an adult sensibility (the importance of being an individual vs. A Bug's Life's cliched 'help the colony'). Also, I thought the animation in Antz was better. It was more 'wow' because it seemed realistic. ABL was cartoony (the ants were blue!). I figure this was due to Disney's influence. Toy Story, made before Disney came on board, was edgier.",6,0,1,2 August 1999
The Mummy Returns," Mindless summer fun, and cheese
","Some of the movies that are the most fun to watch are the action adventure films that come out each summer. They cram lots of special effects, fighting, running and everything else that makes a movie vibrate into about 90 minutes.Unfortunately, that rarely makes these summer flicks *good* movies. Even allowing for the mindlessness of a summer film, I had a hard time with aspects of Mummy 2. I gave it a 6, and only because of the fact it was intended to be a summer film.First, I don't know what Brendan Fraser is doing, but his portrayal of an action hero in the Indiana Jones tradition is awkward. Fraser bounces back and forth between sentimental husband and savy adventurer, able to snatch snakes and knives out of the air. He even *walks* funny, kind of hunched over, gorilla-like. The sequel (and the original) make great efforts to tell us, through dialogue, that Fraser's character is blunt and more likely to fight and ask questions later than think his way out of a tough situation. And yet this same character is so sensitive to his wife, and so aware of the needs of those around him, that his 'action guy' mode seems out of place. He is too smart and too caring to be the fearless hero.Second, why in the world did this movie create a very cheesy 'scorpion king monster' in the finale? That was probably the most fake looking monster, especially the face (which was The Rock's face, sort of), I have seen since that 1982ish movie about Perseus and the Greek gods who manipulated him. You kept expecting this scorpion thing to speak, and we had several close-ups of the enraged face, but all it ever did was roar. And this was supposed to be the latest version of a great warrior bent on taking over the world? He seemed as smart as a rock (no pun intended).Finally, several actors/roles were all wrong, or at least not done well. Izzy, the dirigible-for-hire guy, was supposed to provide comic relief, I guess. But his delivery and English accent were far too sophisticated to be convincing for the kind of rogue-for-hitre character he played. The character who was curator at the British museum and as well as the person who was bringing Ahotep back from the dead made no sense. What was his motivation? We never saw Ahotep reward anyone except his woman. Why help him?Still, the movie was loud, fast and mostly fun, even if it made little sense. If you're trying to escape the summer heat, check out a matinee.",6,0,0,14 May 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Very good start to a series; some people just whine too much
","I am more than a little surprised to see critics of Harry Potter grousing about bad chess moves and details from the book being left out. Lighten up. A movie never includes every detail from a book, nor does it get every small matter of opinion (i.e. chess strategy) correct. A movie entertains, and when it comes from a book, it creates a living world that more of less matches the world the reader had imagined. Harry Potter #1 does a very good job of bringing this world to the screen.I have read all of the books, so I am aware that my mind may have automatically filled in details that someone who had not read the books might be puzzled by. Even so, the movie makes as much sense as a fantasy/fairy tale can, and you have a good time watching it. I won't get into the plot because either you already know, or if you don't, trying to explain it here wouldn't do the movie (or book) justice.I do agree with one criticism that the movie doesn't allow the viewer learn much about the main characters. The Big Three (Harry, Hermione and Ron) are pretty much thrust into the movie and you learn what you can from their actions more than from any exposition. A fourth character, Neville Longbottom, in particular seems to suddenly appear and disappear and then appear again rather awkwardly. But again, that's OK. This movie was 2.5 hours long; it included as many details as it could. At some point, reality dictated that some things be left out. I have a hunch we'll learn more about these characters in the next movie and beyond.The Quidditch game was far more exciting than the ridiculously slow and cliched 'pod race' in Star Wars' The Phantom Menace. In fact, Harry Potter is a far better movie all around. It certainly opens a new world of imagination. It deserves a 9.",9,0,0,26 November 2001
It's a Wonderful Life," Why is this a 'classic'? Basic premise poor
","Finally, at the age of 38, I saw 'It's A Wonderful Life' in its entirety (after catching a few minutes here and there over the years on TV). When it was over, I found myself puzzled over why this movie is considered such a classic.I am not talking about the acting, or the film's technical proficiency. All of that seemed fine, even well-done at times. I am talking about its reason for being: Its story.I'll assume you have seen it, so prepare for spoilers. The basic message of this movie seems to be that a man who never left his home town to pursue his personal dreams nevertheless led a wonderful life due to his kindness and caring for the town and its residents. In fact, when he finally reaches a low point, the town's residents come to bail HIM out, thereby proving what a wonderful person he has been.A nice story, but the movie misses two logical points. First, was the man who never pursued his personal dreams (George Bailey) HAPPY with the life he DID lead? If he was happy with staying home, helping people afford houses and bailing out his family's business, then the point of the movie is MOOT. He evidently gave up very little for a happy life. Other than a few wistful asides, we never see that George is bothered much that he didn't travel the world. He seems perfectly content where he is. So if he is happy, then the central message of kindness and helping others while sacrificing your own dreams is weak or lost entirely.Second, if a man spends DECADES helping out residents of his little town (most of whom remain residents over the years), I don't see it as any great act of charity that when the man needs monetary help, all those people he assisted over the years are willing to give him a few dollars to fix his problem. The climactic ending, when people line up to give George 20 bucks here and 75 bucks there, is made to look like some kind of incredible holiday miracle. But think about it: If a man made it possible for YOU to buy your first home (in an era when buying a home was truly a dream), and a few years later he needs some money for his business (which is the entity that helps so many local people) to survive, wouldn't you go donate whatever you could afford to help him? It wouldn't even have to be that painful, really, in a town with several thousand residents.No, I think the town's true colors are shown earlier, when George's business almost goes under due to a run on the banks and his customers are more than happy to run to his competitor's bank to get 50 cents on a dollar. Some people end up staying ONLY after George uses his own WEDDING MONEY to pay them a fraction of what they sought to withdraw (which, when you think about it, is no real risk ... they can always go to the competitor later if things get worse). THAT seemed to me to also be normal behavior by the local residents, and it was not celebrated like the ending is.Maybe some people were impressed with the plot device of an angel showing George what life might have been like without him. Maybe that was the first time that had been done in a movie, for all I know. But I found that device not unlike the ghosts who visit Scrooge, and that tale was written long before It's A Wonderful Life was made. So I don't get that, either.There were some fun moments, and who doesn't like Jimmy Stewart. But a revered classic? I guess I don't get it. I gave it a 5.",5,40,76,30 December 2002
War of the Worlds," Well done, scary, but ends with a whimper
","War of the Worlds is at this point practically an archetype. It is 'the' alien invasion premise, and Spielberg does it proud in this updated version of the tale. The acting, the effects, the pacing ... all very good. Yes, the allusions to the Holocaust and 9/11 are a bit too much, but not annoyingly so. They just stand out when they happen. There is one twist regarding how the aliens grow their 'red vine' that is so macabre as to be disturbing. I thought it was a nice touch for a scary movie.The oddest thing about this movie is its ending, or more specifically, how it is handled. If you have read the book, or know anything about any incarnation of War of the Worlds, than you basically know what happens at the end. Spielberg chooses to create a thrilling movie for the first hour and a half, and then it essentially ends off camera. We literally go from thrill ride to safety in a few seconds and we are not sure why. Viewers are brought up to speed quickly, but there is no real emotional impact or sense of relief. There is mostly a lot of, 'Huh?' Of course, in all of the War of the Worlds versions, the ending is somewhat silly. It is even more so in Spielberg's movie, which at several points has characters talking about the fact that the aliens must have been planning this invasion for thousands of years. If so, how did they overlook their Achilles heal? Unless that is an allusion to the Bush administration's 'planning' of the Iraq war, it makes no sense. These aliens made a major boo-boo.I enjoyed the first 80 percent of War of the Worlds. If the final 20 percent had been better, it might have earned a 9. As it was, I gave it a 7.",7,0,1,11 January 2006
Love Actually," A good movie that was badly named and marketed
","I only saw Love, Actually because it was shown on a commercial flight and I was bored. From the TV commercials I had seen for it when it was in theatres, I expected it to be a lightweight, goofy romance almost in a slapstick vein, all set at a sappy time of year (Christmas).Well, it is set at a sappy time of year, and milks it. But the various storylines involved (following different couples at various stages of relationships) were far more realistic, thoughtful and serious than I had expected.The movie should have been called 'Four Stories,' or something that made it less slapstick and more a view of different aspects of relationships. True, some of the relationships were slapstick, but that had a place among the more serious tales. And the way various characters were connected was interesting.If you are a guy, this movie is better than you think it will be. I gave it a 7.",7,0,2,3 June 2004
Wedding Crashers," Predictable and somewhat mean-spirited
","I didn't find Wedding Crashers to be the lark it appeared to be in promos. Call me old-fashioned, but when the basis of an activity is to lie in order to get something from someone else, then I don't find those who do that admirable or worthy of being the 'good guys.' The only way that works is is you give back to those you lied to in equal amounts, and that doesn't happen in Wedding Crashers. It is all about using others, and that isn't fun.On top of that, Wedding Crashers was as predictable a movie as I have seen in the past 10 years. The opening collage of crashed weddings was too long, but it only took about 15 minutes to guess what would happen to the main characters who had spent years callously using others ... they would finally discover love. Duh. It would have been funnier if they had met some women who were better at using them than they were at using women.Wedding Crashers creates a whole mythology that is interesting, but not really very funny. I gave it a 5.",5,0,0,7 February 2006
Shrek," Shrek beats Disney's dreck
","Shrek was fun. Shrek was witty. Shrek created characters you cared about. Shrek had wonderful animation. Shrek was not made by Disney.Only two things disappointed me about Shrek:1. It's humor wasn't sharp enough. There were jokes, sure, and a good number of them were there for the adults in the audience. But Shrek never seemed to go far enough. For example, just seeing the Disney characters homeless was OK. It would have been better if the Disney characters would have been repetitive and shallow each time they popped up. THEN there would have been a joke.2. MINOR SPOILER FOLLOWS ... I was very disappointed that the princess became the, uh, creature she became at night. The movie's message was about looking beyond looks and beauty to see how wonderful the person was inside. And the plot started off very promisingly, with the characters doing just that. But the fact that the princess became an, uh, you know, at night was such a cop out. Why couldn't she have become a troll or a unicorn or something that was DIFFERENT. Once she became something that was the SAME, then the issue of looking at inner beauty was removed. I didn't agree with that twist at all.Still, loved Shrek, and hope to see more of him in a real, feature movie (not the cheap VHS knock-offs). We gave the movie an 8.",8,0,0,30 May 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," A grudgingly enjoyable experience
","I gotta say upfront that I despise Disney. Oh, not the Disney of my childhood (20-25 years ago), which brought me fascinating, sometimes cutting edge animation movies such as Jungle Book. No, I mean Michael Eisner's Disney, the soulless marketing machine that has leeched away its creativity in its quest to boost the stock price.So my wife and I attended 'New Groove' reluctantly, and only because it was the sole movie at the 24-theatre multiplex that was on at the right time and wasn't sold out. I rated it a 6, and have no problem stating that 'New Groove' is the most original movie from Disney since, perhaps, pre-Little Mermaid days.Good things: Voices (David Spade was perfectly whiney, the guy who played Puddy on Seinfeld was great as the oaf assistant, and Eartha Kitt was a purrrrrfectly evil villian), NO INSIPID SONGS, no cutesy sidekick characters for alleged comic relief, and maybe best of all, NEW GROUND was broken. For once we watched a movie headed into who knows what direction (of sure, the overall plot was predictable, but the details were interesting), and we saw things that were oddly inexplicable but endearing (this emperor like to dance, hence The Groove).Bad things: The inexplicable but endearing stuff was never fully utilized (what, no raves at the palace?), the movie dragged at times during the llama emperor's journey, and, ultimately, you didn't really care about any of these characters. You just wanted to have fun.So a grudging tip of the hat to Disney. Judging from the lack of commercial and marketing support you guys don't know exactly how to present 'New Groove,' and maybe that is why it is your best animated film in a decade.",6,0,0,27 December 2000
The Sixth Sense," *This* surprised people? Slow movie, good performances
","Finally, I watched The Sixth Sense in April 2000 on the DVD I had purchased a week earlier. I had tried very hard to avoid any discussion of the movie (as I always do with any movie) until I had a chance to see it. The one thing I had heard (before I could change the TV channel) was that there was a 'big surprise' at the end.Now, I am an average guy, maybe a bit above average in education. And I will try not to give away the 'surprise' here, in case you haven't seen the movie, yet. But the 'big surprise' was obvious to me 17 minutes into the film. It was so obvious to me by the time it was 'revealed' that I had thought, in a scene where the boy and the doc agree that their therapy is over, that both parties *already acknowledged* the surprise in that scene and were saying goodbye. At the time, I thought, with some admiration, 'This is a pretty subtle way to make that realization occur.' So imagine my confusion when a few minutes later we get the big, dramatic scene where one of the characters *finally* does realize what's what. I was in disbelief ... 'You mean he *didn't know*?' I wondered.I don't get it. 'The Crying Game' had a 'big surprise' that was obvious as soon as they showed the 'female' character's face. And now this. Am I somehow amazingly intuitive or is everyone else slow? I mean, when you see the doc sitting in the boy's apartment across from the mother and *no one is talking* doesn't that give you a big clue? And the fact that earlier no one seemed irked at the loud conversation in the church? And once you realize that, and note similar instances as the movie progresses, isn't it obvious?Perhaps because I saw no surprise, this movie seemed very slow to me. A lot of worried looks on the kid's face as he avoid various feelings or actual encounters with dead people. And very few interactions with the dead people. To me, the best scene by far was at the wake for the little girl who died. The movie should have had 2-3 additional examples like that, instead of a lot of peeking around corners by the boy.Still, the actors did a very good job. For that reason alone I gave this movie a 5.",6,0,0,24 April 2000
The Matrix," Good idea, some great execution, but fizzles
","The Matrix took a great idea, set it up in a very involving manner, then collapsed at the end by seeming to forget everything it had set up and devolving into a plain old shoot out.I'm not a K. Reeves fan, but he was fine here because he didn't need to act (I don't think he has really acted since 'Bill & Ted'). His supporting cast was better, if underused (we never got to know Mouse or a handful of the other members of the resistance band).It was the concept that shined and hooked the viewer immediately.SPOILERS AHEADThe idea that we live in an illusion set up by a 'master race' artificial intelligence that uses human bodies in stasis as battery power was horrifying and well presented. The mythology of a prophesied 'chosen one' was a bit shallow; no time was spent explaining how and when this prophesy came to be, or even how long this resistance had been around looking for The One.That made the repeated references to whether Reeves' character was The One annoying, because it was hard to tell why anyone would think he was, and what exactly made him The One to begin with (that is finally explained in a couple of lines in the latter third of the movie).Many people have written about the visual effects in The Matrix, so I won't other than to say they were outstanding. Even better was the fact that the effects had a point; they showed how a person in the simulated world could use his/her awareness of the simulation to alter the supposed 'reality.' And altering the simulated reality could mean life or death.For the first hour to 75 minutes of The Matrix, I was drawn in and at times mesmerized. Then the bottom fell out.For reasons I thought were unclear, when it came time to rescue the leader of the resistance, Reeves and a fellow rebel choose to storm the enemy citadel and basically 'blow stuff up.' Two people take on a small army of guards and somehow, inexplicably, and with vitually no strategy or stealth, manage to blast their way through to the imprisoned leader. For a movie that took great pains to show us the virtual simulation and how it could be manipulated by those with the ability, abandoning that tack for a plain old blow-em-up was patronizing and insulting. Sure, perhaps the twosome managed to dodge a few bullets through their VR tricks, but not the thousands of rounds sent their way by multiple guards. Why take the chance that you won't get through? Because you are The One and can't be stopped? Please. Then why not just saunter through unarmed?It would have made a lot more sense, and would have been much more satisfying, if the duo had come up with some special maneuvers to use their awareness of the VR to their advantage.The climactic battle between Reeves and the computer's agents was similar. It did make use of a special talent The One had, but otherwise, it was like a kung fu movie. Very disappointing. An analogy would be watching a terrific play on Broadway that, in the last act, suddenly became vaudeville.It's too bad the movie went in that direction. Its impact would have been much greater had it continued on the path on which it started.",Null,0,0,20 October 1999
Gladiator," Amazing visuals, but little sense
","Last week a co-worker told me her husband thought Gladiator was 'the best movie he has every seen.' I figured I should finally see it, and we watched it on PPV. Now I guess I know more about my co-worker's husband.We rated Gladiator a 7, and that is due to the terrific visual settings that convey an epic scope to the film. Without those settings, it would have been a 5. Gladiator revolves around the beliefs and actions of its main character, a man who seems to be stuck in the past and unable to see much around him for what it is. When his luck turns bad after a succession at the top, you feel sorry for the guy but also wonder why such a great leader of men didn't wake up sooner.Honor, loyalty and 'the good of Rome' is at the heart of Gladiator. If you don't buy into those concepts, then you have a hard time caring much about Maximus or his journey. In this case, I had a hard time with several things, including:<ul><li>Maximus is portrayed as a successful leader who wants Rome to return to rule by the people through the Senate. Setting aside questions about whether the Senators actually represent 'the people' well, the film makes absolutely no effort to show you anything about Rome that is worth preserving. Its citizens are described several times as a 'mob.' It's leadership spent years on a crusade in Germania that even the emporer said solved nothing. There are no scenes showing citizens who hope for anything better, be it democracy or real leadership or a vision. So what is it, exactly, Maximus wants to save by supporting the Senate? Even Maximus lives so far outside Rome on his nice spread that people call him 'The Spaniard.' He had never even *been* to Rome! Why should the viewer care who rules Rome?</li></ul><ul><li>Maximus is never set up properly as a fighter who could be an amazing gladiator. In the film's initial battle, he rides on a horse against basically a horde of undisciplined neo-Vikings on foot, and attacks from the rear, no less. He manages to survive, but we never see that he has any special skill in battle other than as a leader. From there we suddenly must believe that he can defeat five or more gladiators in a 5 vs. 1 scenario where his opponents have armor and better weapons! How did that happen? There must have been some great training going on in the gladiator school.</li></ul><ul><li>The film also never does enough to show Maximum's anger and motivation to meet the new emporer after Maximum's family is slaughtered (no big spoiler; by now you should know his motivation). Is he mourning? Yes. Is he mad? I guess. But he is never seething, or furious, or even apparently taking out his anger on his opponents. He simply kills mechanically, then moves on.</li></ul><ul><li>At one point a big deal is made of the fact that to survive in the Roman games, Maximus must 'win the crowd.' He promptly goes out into the colisseum with his school's fighters and they win, but not with any flair. Yet suddenly the crowd loves Maximus. Should't we have seen some effort on his part to win them over? This scene was especially disappointing because it is Maximus' first face-to-face with the emporer. Yet we see no emotion, no feeling. Just resignation. It was anti-climactic and a letdown.</li></ul>I'm not sure why some people loved this film. Maybe they buy into the honor, loyalty, old soldier thing. I do, too, when I feel it is warranted. In this case, Maximus reminded me of most Kevin Costner characters: He is there, but wooden, and not very sympathetic. Russell Crowe may have played Maximus as too deadened by grief and not motivated enough by life or revenge. Ultimately, I was mostly uninterested.",7,0,0,15 January 2001
The Island," Great start, then takes the wrong path
","After a fascinating first 30 minutes or so, The Island goes big when it should have stayed spare.Like Gattaca (one of my favorite movies), The Island presents us with a future that asks us questions about where we are headed in our real present. And it asks us to decide whether this future is what we want. Unlike Gattaca, which kept the chases to a minimum and instead capitalized on great performances by its actors as their actions gave us new insights, The Island becomes what seems like one, big chase scene broken into several different parts (depending on the vehicle being chased).We figure out in the first quarter of the movie what is really going on here. That first quarter is very effective at intriguing and disgusting the viewer. Unfortunately, because we know so quickly what is happening, that leaves the next 90 minutes to essentially follow two characters as they are thrust into new and dangerous situations and then escape them. During all of this time, the viewer wonders when the movie will return to some of the central questions raised during its first 45 minutes. It eventually does, sort of.The acting is excellent, if a bit disconcerting when characters who appear to be at least 30 years of age and some close to 40 seem to be at best young teenagers in the way they struggle to express questions about their environment and future. Even so, the main characters seem to learn about reality a bit too quickly. They act when they should still be asking questions, preferably when they had time to do so and weren't simply running.And the movie succumbs to cheap impulses when it allows the security people at 'The Institute,' who know what is going on there, to laugh or taunt their victims. It would have been far creepier if those security forces had remained professional at all times, because that would have indicated these people were sincere in their support and not just paid lackeys.If The Island had cut out 20 minutes of chases and replaced it with more discussion among the main characters about who they are and whether that is a feasible answer, it would have been better. As it was, we gave The Island a 6.",6,0,1,25 January 2006
