Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent Movie!
","I believe that Episode one is a great movie that can be enjoyed by (most) everybody. The acting was great, the music was superb, and the effects were amazing. Yes, Jar Jar was a little annoying, but he didn't ruin the movie.
One thing I wish people would do is to stop complaining about this movie. This is George Lucas's movie! You didn't make it. He did. He was brought us many excellent movies, and you want to turn your back on him now? You should be on your knees praising this man. He has brought us many years of entertainment and breathtaking stories, and you want to kick him in the stomach. What you need to do is kiss his feet. Keep up the great work George Lucas.***** out of *****",Null,1,2,20 October 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Very good,but the book is much better!
","(Warning: Contains Spoilers) I will say right now that the movie adaptation of A Clockwork Orange, is very very close to the book. But I think it would have been a little better if the last chapter of the book was included into the movie. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the movie, and have recommended it to many and they have loved it. Okay, this chapter takes place a few years after Alex's near death situation, and has him talking to his old friends (who are now married) and has him bringing a son into the world. But enough of the book. The movie contained much of the original speeches from within the book. (Word of warning! The movie's words are extremely difficult to understand, because they are made up words mixed with real words. IE-- Glazzies--eyes, Horrorshow--'good', droogs--friends)If you can stomach the content of the movie, I suggest you read the book, because you will receive a much better (if possible) thrill.But be warned, for the movie and book contains scenes (and depictions) of rape, drug use, and a bit of the ol' ultra-violence. (you'll understand if you see!)***** out of *****",10,1,2,25 June 2000
Bram Stoker's Dracula," And?
","Okay, this movie was okay in some parts, but it contained a huge factual error. Dracula CANNOT become a werewolf. Okay, now that that's out of the way, I can talk about this movie. The acting was pretty good, but the storyline lacked in many places. It was pretty cool seeing how Dracula came to be, but after that, it went downhill. It became so drab in some area's, that I fastfowarded through half the movie!Bottom line--Stick to the classics, or if you want to try it, rent this on a rainy day....a VERY rainy day.** out of *****",Null,0,1,16 January 2001
