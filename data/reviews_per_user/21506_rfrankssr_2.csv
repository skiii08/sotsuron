Ford v Ferrari," Firts rate film with a first rate cast
","This is why I go to the movies. James Mangold has always been a favorite Writer/Director of mine and he delivers perfectly with this 'buddy' movie about one of the greatest drivers of all time with one of the greatest car designers of all time. Bale and Damon are spot on , though it's hard for me to decide which one turned in the best performance, because, as of this writing, Bale has locked the Golden Globe and SAG nominations. The rest of the cast just added to the incredible story of Ford taking on Ferrari at the 24 Hours of LeMans.
For racing enthusiasts, this is pure adrenaline, several scenes during the race sequences that made me jump back in my seat. Phedon Papamichael's cinematography is amazing. There is a scene where Miles (Bale) takes his son out to the LAX runway and explains to him the perfect lap. It was such a touching scene (it plays later in the movie) because of the way Papamichael lit it. It sent chills down my back.
In conclusion, a must see film for anyone, racing enthusiast or not. One of the best race films ever and one of the best pictures of the year.",10,3,6,15 December 2019
The Village," M. Knight continues to impress
","I have just seen 'The Village' on DVD, failing to make it to the theater to see the first run. As usual, Mr. Shyamalan's movie is a delight to watch for both script and performances. After reading several dismal reviews about this film, I thought it would be good to level the playing field. First, Mr. Shyamalan has been referenced in several statements with the noted film maker Alfred Hitchcock. Although both film makers have the ability to project fear with both script and visuals (and I don't mean graphic visuals), each has their own style of film making. With each new film, Mr. Shyamalan grows as a film maker, a true story teller, which is a rare thing in current film. Second, the story itself is one of simplicity, yet grounded in realism. Simple in the fact of showing us the lives of the characters and the events that surround them. Realistic in the enlightening, not jaw dropping, revelation near the end of the film. Right now I am beginning a career in film writing. I can only hope to write something this good. Third, the fine performances of all, notably, Ms. Howard. There are no scene stealer's and Mr. Shyamalan has the ability to evoke low key, yet indelible characters that remain with you after watching the film. Finally, Mr. Shyamalan himself. One only needs to go back and review 'Praying with Anger' to know that a great artist was in the making. Mr. Shyamalan does not just make movies; he tells us stories. When so much junk is green lighted and put to film, that comes and goes without so much as a twinkle, 'The Village', as with his previous films, add to the genre not of thriller or horror or mystery, but to the genre of storytelling. A great ability indeed.",Null,0,0,16 January 2005
