The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Good, not great, mostly killing time/setting the scene for Part 2
","It was exactly what I expected essentially. First of all, after reading the book, yes, a lot happens in the third installment, but it does not need to be split up into two movies. They could cut out a lot of the slow parts in the book and easily condense it into one movie. However, since this is clearly just a money making technique, they reserve Part 1 simply for killing time and setting up the action that will come in Part 2. This movie consisted solely of Katniss running around depressed and confused in District 13, struggling with her inner conflict of whether or not to accept her role as the Mockingjay, all the while worrying about the safety of her lover Peeta, a romance that after dragging the movies out over 2 years, is pretty dead and lacks chemistry in my opinion. I think that Jennifer Lawrence is an excellent actress, but it is often very difficult to show Katniss's emotional side in the movies due to the fact that the audience is not nearly as 'inside her head' as the first person perspective delivers in the books. Honestly, she just comes off as a mopey hard a**, and gets less and less likable and emotion evoking with each movie. Like I said, it was good, kept me entertained, but I would probably wait, save the money, and just rent it if you want to see it. Just like Harry Potter 7: Part 1, it's really nothing special and just sets the scene for Part 2. If you've been following this series strictly through the movies, it'll probably do more for you than if you've read the books and already know what's coming.",6,16,29,27 November 2014
Hugo," Not at all what it was made out to be, in a bad way
","I had wanted to see this movie for a long time. After getting all these nominations and winning 5 Oscars, beating out The Descendants (which I loved), I figured it had to be good. I was wrong. The only amazing aspect of this movie was the visual. I'll give them that, the costumes, set design, and CGI were really cool to look at, but that's not going to keep me entertained for 2 hours. The plot line was utterly boring and pointless, while the acting from pretty much everyone was over-dramatic and cheesy. I can't seem to understand what all the big fuss is about this movie. From watching the trailers, I got the impression, as did the rest of the world I'm sure, that it was an Action/Adventure movie about an orphan boy in a train station trying to unlock a secret about his father. Sort of like A Series of Unfortunate Events, right? Nope. Here's a few things that I did not like (the list goes on and on): First, the plot is really boring to begin with. It seems that they spend the first 30 minutes of the movie just setting the scene, with the little boy Hugo just running around the train station. Gets your attention at first, but gets boring really fast. Then, as soon as you think the movie has climaxed and about to get a little better, they completely scrap the already boring plot they had and pursue and even more boring one. If you've seen the movie, then you know that the resolve/ending was just a way for Scorsese to discreetly glorify himself and suck up to the Academy. Definitely don't take the kids to this one. It looks so kid friendly and fun for the whole family, but I promise, you will be asleep within the first hour. And one more thing, why the heck is EVERY character speaking in a British accent when they are in Paris??? Very unrealistic and obnoxious. Easy fix: set it in London! Big picture, I was extremely disappointed in this movie and am still confused as to why it is so critically acclaimed.",4,1,3,2 July 2012
Dark Shadows," Started out good, all downhill from there...
","I was really excited to see this movie after seeing the trailer on TV all the time. I love Johnny Depp and Tim Burton's done some good stuff, so I figured it would be a pretty decent movie. However, the trailers completely give you the wrong image, making it out to be a funny 'fish out of water' comedy, when the movie itself it pretty dark and intense. I figured from the trailer it was PG-13 most likely because of language, but it was pretty violent and a bit sexual, not something you want your 6 year old seeing. Another thing, (I hate it when they do this!) ALL THE FUNNY LINES ARE IN THE TRAILER! So if you've seen the trailer, I kid you not, you've seen the entire comedic aspect of the movie. They could have totally gone in another direction by making this strictly a comedy with not nearly as dramatic and intense a plot. I would have enjoyed it much better if it focused on the funny things Barnabas does while trying to assimilate into society, like the Disney movie 'Enchanted' or 'Back to the Future.' There is one scene where Barnabas sees a McDonald's sign and thinks it's the Devil and another where he rips open the family TV thinking there is a 'tiny songstress' inside! Why wasn't there more of that in the movie and why wasn't that the main focus? Instead, the story focuses on a corporate battle and the rivalry between Barnabas and the witch Angelique. Honestly, the rest of the characters are just pointless and do nothing. I get that Tim Burton was trying to stay true to the old TV show, but by doing that, he ends up cramming in a bunch of little subplots that are really pointless and lead no where. He could have appealed to a much larger audience and most likely been more successful if he had stuck with the comedy and even possibly made the film PG. To sum it all up, MORE COMEDY, LESS WEIRD DRAMA.",5,4,8,14 May 2012
Rango," Great animated movie!
","I went to go see this movie with my family and I definitely enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I mean, don't get me wrong I love Johnny Depp and all, but looked to me like this movie just wouldn't live up to his reputation. I was wrong. The storyline is very well put together, with just enough comedy that's understandable for younger children and just enough action to keep you entertained without having to make the rating PG-13. The character of Rango very much showed traits of Jack Sparrow, probably Depp's most well known character from Pirates of the Caribbean, and was definitely appealing and easy to relate to for the audience (we all want to feel like a hero sometimes!). What blew me away though was the absolutely incredible animation! The characters seem so lifelike and not even the simplest detail is ever forgotten in each scene. Overall, it's a great movie for all ages and I recommend seeing it on your next trip to the theater!",8,1,3,5 March 2011
