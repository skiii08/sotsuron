The King's Speech," Delightfully Decent
","German forces are mobilizing against Poland, England is about to declare war, WW II is imminent and a man with a mere ceremonial position, who makes no decisions as to the fate of the nation or the world, feels as though he is in a dire place since he has to read a three page speech on the radio. Despite a movie about a leader during this time and place the movie focuses on a rather light and bland premise that actually comes out as novel and a little interesting. The almost minor personal issue to be overcome compared to the grandiosity of whats going on in the world effectively humanizes modern royalty.Charming to witness the reluctant and later warmly developed friendship between royalty and a commoner where easy crowd pleasing moments come naturally and predictably (such as the shock and awe and merry excitement of having royalty come to the commoner's doorsteps asking for help) This personal nearly debilitating difficulty of someone with seemingly the best 'job' in the world, becomes a nightmarish scenario. Some of us may have, others may not understand such a fear but the movie accomplishes the humanization of the Monarch making him relatable to the everyman. Colin Firth was a good choice sustaining his customary stiff, uncomfortable manner throughout the movie. He did a good job mingling his well expressed uptightness with a stutter. It is not the most interesting movie about the Monarchy as the movie 'The Queen' comes closer to being, yet it was still a poignant crowd pleaser of a friendship between the King and his Speech Therapist.",8,6,12,29 November 2010
Black Swan," Dark Subconsciousness
","A dark, mysterious roller-coaster of a thriller into an awakening of a subconscious.On the surface its about ballet and the quest for perfection. Portman's character is granted the swan queen part which encompasses both the white swan and the black swan roles. She is a marvel technically and can fully encompass the white swan part but she can't perfect the black swan part which requires not only technical proficiency but a transcendence from who she is. At her level more than technical mastery is needed but a certain essence of the spirit is necessary to perfect the artistry. She is the innocent, virginal white part but she lacks a dark passion which must be emoted in order to perfect the black part. This inner dark side lies dormant in Portman's character as it would in most innocent, sheltered youths. Influences from her teacher and her look alike competitor and the queer controlling relationship with her mother help her unleash various dark and indulgent emotions such as jealousy, anger, pride, rebellion and lust. The rapidity at which these perhaps novel emotions are felt, along with the obvious pressures to perfect such a performance, and the physicality of grueling ballet training all take us on a journey into a slowly developed spiraling madness of Nina's repressed innermost mind. The filmmaker created an intimate point of view portrait. We are transported into Nina's awakening of her dark subconscious soul. And we follow Nina on her path of madness by slowly stepping out of reality into a hallucinatory decadence that will lead to the glory of perfection or a fatal destruction.The swan queen role of the black and white swans' is a wonderful metaphor for the duality of humanity.A profoundly interesting psychological character study uniquely blended with artsy horroresque intensity that is so well made that we become totally absorbed into it.",10,1,4,27 December 2010
Frost_Nixon," Don't Judge a movie by its name
","It is hard to believe that a movie climaxing in a mere TV interview and with a title 'Frost/Nixon' can be one of the most exciting movies of the year. But Nixon's and Frost's character are so well created by the script, the actors and the director that we become so drawn in and connected to them.It begins with Frost's (a TV personality) off handed interest in Nixon. Then his ambitious plan to interview him, followed by four subsequent interviews, all in the hopes of a clear victory, which is gaining that in which no one else is able to get, an admission of guilt and wrongdoing.It is easy to create Nixon as though he is a monster, someone inherently evil, as the perpetrator and sneak behind Watergate, as the epitome of political corruption as the bully and over dog expected to come out of the interviews, which he labels 'a duel', unscathed, but the director gave him a real personal touch. Not only is he flawed, has a heavy chip on his shoulder, intensely competitive, wildly ambitious, greedy and slightly mad but he also has refinement, kind manners, compassion and even his own brand of raw, rough humor. He is his own person, idiosyncratic and despite being a former supremely controversial president, whom people are in awe of, don't know how to react to, he is a very real person. It is left open as to whether you hate him or sympathize with him for his self induced misfortune. Hate him for his corrupt misdeeds and the person who he seems to be but explored as a cause is a fascinating deep seated psychological daemon that attacks his soul thereby making this arguably evil, corrupt, leader of the free world all so human.Frost too, although a bit of a dichotomy to Nixon, with his over eager perhaps a bit phony smile, a bright, light air and flamboyant persona, was realistically created and an interesting personality.The vastly different personalities were an interesting aspect of the interview and were captured by the creators. The lead up to the interview and the tit for tat before the interviews was the build up. The actual interviews were so well done especially after the build up that it left you on the edge of your seat, hanging by every word. Upon YouTubing the actual interview you will be wowed as to how close the makers came to recreating history.Despite the intensity there were some funny lighthearted moments. You can't judge a book by its cover or a movie by its name.",10,3,6,16 December 2008
I'm Not There," Chaos accept me
","Very artsy to the point of blurring clarity. As the man's life was, the movie is chaotic. And where at first confusing, the movie comes together when the connection or the parallel is drawn as the movies chaotic, poetic, artsy style reflects and manifests Dylan's own.Not a chronology of his life or a typical biopic but rather an incoherent collage of aspects of his life. Therefore, it may be accessible only to those that already have some slight knowledge of the man. Dylan's biggest fans will derive the most pleasure from the movie, since they will see, hear and 'be on the inside' to the hidden innuendos camouflaged with in all the art and poetry of the film.The movie is poetic and literary filled with Dylan's incoherent, poetic, wise absurdisms.  'I accept chaos I don't know if chaos accepts me' Brilliant to chaotically jumble different character together since it is a reflection of who he is, as an amorphous, constantly evolving and changing soul. This is an interesting character with an ironical twist on the revered cliché of knowing yourself and being true to who you are. What he was and what he was true to, was a man of no standard who did his own thing. His chaos and lack of knowledge of himself was his individuality. One of the greatest symbols of this was when he 'went electric' alienating his die hard folk fans yet making history.  'I wake up in a day and go to sleep someone else'. Style of movie reflects this Brilliantly.Of all the actors playing Dylan, Cate Blanchett's characterization sticks out as phenomenal and one of the best performances",9,1,2,28 December 2007
Inglourious Basterds," Pulpy history didn't work
","The lacking story line did not have the characteristic, imaginary 'coolness' of his other films. Alas, this was the worst of his films and a disappointment from such a great/unique filmmaker.The movie was divided into a series of 5 chapters. Each chapter consisted of long drawn out dialogue, containing some suspense and concluding in a rather disappointingly predictable manner thus lacking the customarily ironic dialogue that make conversations about cheeseburgers fascinating and also lacking the delightfully shocking surprises and uniquely interesting imagination. These five chapters connected in such a disjointed manner it seemed as though he were making 5 random clips that vaguely associated with each other (similar to a movie he had a hand in – four rooms).Other Tarantino films employ completely original conceptualized fusions of genres like Kill Bill's fusion of kung fu with the spaghetti western aura and sexy female assassins. What a unique fun concept! This concept although somewhat unique, (the killing Nazi fantasy), had a slight tasteless sensation maybe since it turns this whole event into a thrill rather than something that should remain solemn.For such a long movie, I've never seen such a complete lack of character development. Even with the seemingly pure raw entertaining Kill Bills which contained characters with interesting histories and vulnerabilities, the Inglorious Bastard's characters went below one dimensional, to half a dimension, almost robotic like and all of them were so insignificant and the movie was 2.5 hours long! Despite all the bad, it is a Tarantino film and since it is so, it is a refreshing divergence from the prototypical. Tarantino's trademark perverse tongue and cheek violence was rampant throughout even if it mostly lacked the violence art of Kill Bill 1. Tarantino's trademark personal dialogue was there despite getting boring at times.Tarantino as great as a film maker he is clearly has his boundaries. You can sense his contemporary soul clashing with historical matter thereby limiting his scope and imagination or making things seem way too out of place. Historical stuff no matter how 'pulpy' it gets might be outside his boundaries.",5,12,31,24 August 2009
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Anesthetize me
","What can sometimes redeem a movie that does not necessarily need a craftily inventive plot or a believable story are characters that are memorable for their bizarrely idiosyncratic humor such as characters from some of the other Judd Apatow movies such as McLovin from Superbad (which actually contained a really compelling story) or the characters in Knocked Up. The plastic characters created in this movie were such mundane clichés, lacking personalities and so unmemorably unfunny that they fail to redeem this unrealistic, poorly conjured story.The main character goes away and happens to find his ex girlfriend randomly in the same hotel in the same spot he decided to travel to. Then there are some love triangles, they both get jealous and feel bad, it just gets ridiculous and uninteresting to the point where you will ignore the story. It is true, we do not go to see these type of movies for the compelling story lines. We go to laugh. The forced raunchy humor has been done in other movies in a more over the top and intelligent way. The humor just wasn't there. One of the biggest laughs and the only innovative scene comes from showing the main characters crown jewels and gratuitously showing them again and again as his girlfriend breaks up with him. It was stupid, it didn't shock, it wasn't funny, i just didn't care. This movie may be comparable to some of those dull forgettable romantic comedies. They, however, actually have some heart and poignancy. This has none.The movie is memorable for having the worst sex scenes on film. The scenes were meant to be funny but they just seemed stupid.For all these reasons the movie was an absolute bore to watch. It wasn't that shocking, the humor was done before and was much better, and the story was absolutely terrible. Not the worst movie because it did contain a few forced laughs.",2,17,38,24 April 2008
The Hunger Games," Good Action Movie
","This was a very good action movie with an idiotic story premise. Most of the movie takes place in a forest-like arena where enemies and allies get knocked out one by one in a guerrilla warfare scenario like those classic Scwartzenagger and Stalone Extravaganzas from the 80s. It has a similar vein to the classic movies Predator and Rambo.The story is rather ridiculous and hard to swallow only to be digested with the understanding that this is a total fantasy and despite the characters being humanoid we must understand this to be another world in some way.Its about a futuristic society that pulls children's names out of hats essentially to be sacrificed. One out of 24 is supposed to survive the competition where the combatants fight with each other to the death with primitive weapons. And the oddest thing and purposefully hard to stomach is that that a small 11 year old girl must compete against a strong fully grown 18 year old male. It is a hard to swallow story. The world is so barbaric that our mind had to sense it in the middle earth realm and not this world. It is somewhat interesting to understand the reasoning behind this all powerful insecure government that runs such an event to keep the subjects in subjugation by fear yet teasing them with the smallest iota of hope. The expansive evil society and government will clearly play a larger part in the sequels but the movie wisely focused on the thrilling action packed training, build up to the competition and the game itself. Making a dumb, very entertaining and engaging action movie was beneficial over dwelling on another evil government movie. The charismatic actors gave the movie its edge and appeal.There are some parallels to the world of reality TV. The competitors go on stage and are made up in their best outfits to try to win appeal and gain favor from the audience. The competition is shown to the public on screen. It was very reminiscent and hauntingly satirical of the reality shows in our world.",8,2,7,3 May 2012
Juno," Sarcasm to the max
","Lighthearted, with not much of a story or drama, what the movie really is about and what the audience will derive the most entertainment from, is, as the title of the movie reads, - Juno.A unique character is created. Juno actually is a good role model for young girls even though she unexpectedly got pregnant. She is independent, strong-willed, mature, smart, unaffected or moved by High school's socializms, truly her own person (a character correctly calls her. 'different'). Mostly amusing is her somewhat nasty sarcasm. Juno's constant snide sarcastic remarks permeate the whole movie especially towards the beginning and despite the burden she must deal with. This makes Juno appear totally devoid of innocence in sex, pregnancy and just about everything. Her 'been-there-done-that' vibe seems far fetched for a 16 year old and more like a women 20 to 30 years older who has lived through life's agonies and ecstasies.Not a hilarious, laugh out loud movie, unless you are really into sarcasm, which Im sure a lot of people are.What starts out with a lot of sarcasm merges into a somewhat heartwarming story, as things don't go exactly as planned (and a good thing they don't otherwise this movie would have gone nowhere).Also the dialogue was intelligent and witty. Perhaps too intelligent and witty for its own good which made it seem extremely contrived. On the spot one-liners from Juno actually felt as though they were planned and edited months in advance. Dialogue and wriitng are believable when they have more of a naturalistic flow.Overall a bit blah but cute.",6,16,39,28 December 2007
Midnight in Paris," What is Romantic Paris?
","Ever wonder what 'Romantic Paris' is all about? The latest Woody creation showcases this hyped notion literally through a montage of photograph-like camera shots of various streets. The blatant depiction of the romanticized Paris does not get too tacky because Woody satirizes the great romantic played by Owen Wilson and the romantic in all of us; the American who wants to live in Paris, walk in the rain and write. Wisely making Paris as the setting is perfect for the American audience who at times regard Paris as the ultimate city of romance. Climaxing with a wonderful message to this romantic protagonist, we once again get Woody's amusing, societal effacing commentary.This is a fantastical film where the protagonist gets transported to Paris in the 1920 after midnight. He gets to briefly meet some of the great artists and writers who get to comment on him as a writer, an artist, a man, and a lover. This did get a bit cheesy but it was also a bit of fun. It is fun to see the modern man interacting with legendary people from the past but these characters from the past were mere characterizations of the great artists. Perhaps it was the intention to make these artists of the past how we envision them, containing the proper imagined eccentricities and that was OK since the modern man goes back and fantasizes about it as how he imagines them similar to how we imagine them. The charactertures and therefore not real people plagued all the characters of this film even the ones of the present. It was also not very believable that the protagonist and the fiancée ever got to the level of being on the verge of marriage since they were at such odds with each other and had such conflicting souls. Even though the characters weren't great this is another gem of Woody's witticisms, philosophies, and scenes of natural urban beauty. It is the perfect depiction of Romantic nostalgic Paris in the rain.",7,3,7,26 May 2011
Milk," Relevant - still
","Milk is emotionally arousing, highly spirited movie about a minor politician at the forefront of a civil rights movement in the late 70s. Civil rights movies are always inspiring as the movement itself is, and this movement has to this day not come to fruition. His battle to get into office and then his battle once in office for civil rights for homosexuals will reach the depth of your heart and get you rooting for these rights. .Penn and Hirsh's performances were the highlight. It was amusing to witness how these actors so believably capture the subtle effeminate disposition (Penn was great and Hirsh is always good but here, surprisingly unbelievable). Unfortunately, despite the way Penn truly envelops the character Harvey Milk, WE, do not become that enveloped with Milk. The character Milk still feels as though he is just on the surface. We see his determinism towards his movement and his minor quirks but we don't really know him, his hobbies, his outside interests, but most of all we don't connect with his innermost feelings nor do we permeate his soul. For this reason I would not recommend to drop everything and see it right away. The greatest movies about a character, which are primarily about the character, explore the insides of his/her personality and completely expose their beings to us. Perhaps it was the intent to make the politics and the movement the theme which happens to still be so intensely relevant in our time.",8,5,11,8 December 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," No Spectacle here
","If you're expecting to see a richly stylish, surrealistically Gothic, uniquely artistic imagery and sets that distinguishes Tim Burton think again. There is about two minutes of such imagery and besides that the majority of the movie is gray, bland, lifeless, shot primarily in one room and uninteresting to look at. Not the Tim Burton spectacle you would expect.For a very simple plot line the story still managed to be chaotic without a flow or structure. . Despite the erratic way the story was told it moved at a snails pace due to drawn out musical numbers. You may zone out as you mindlessly stare at the drawn-out singing that fails to thrust the story forward. The music is classic but subjectively enjoyable. It may appear to some, to be water-down, overly dramatic, and drawn out. Most of the movie is singing.Kudos goes to the costumes, makeup and casting (Todd Sweeney's girlfriend, his daughter, and her young suitor) which brought some of Burton's unique artistry to being.",3,2,9,4 January 2008
Interstellar," Imaginative and Real Science Fiction
","A wonderful, imaginative, and finally real sci-fi premise takes us on a journey to the outer-limits of imagination. Very Imaginative yet keeping within the realms of real science fiction as opposed to fantasy, Interstellar may be what Sci-Fi people have been waiting for since 2001 A Space Odyssey. Interstellar, undeniably influenced by 2001, will likely join 2001 within the pantheon of the greatest sci-fi epics ever made.The film goes on an exciting journey though space to explore other worlds and reaches other dimensions. This premise and story line paired with the big budget extravaganza of wondrous visuals and state of the art effects make for an amazing movie going experience.Attempting to connect this Sci-Fi with mass appeal as opposed to challenging us with novelty as Kubrick did, make Interstellar fall slightly short of that most legendary sci-fi film - 2001. For example, the wonder and amazement of the unknown of space travel will be fused with thriller/action sequences and characters that suddenly and implausibly become evil bad guys, so that the awe and amazement stemming from the unknown of space/time travel alas merge into the more routine, 'entertaining', unrealistic Hollywood thrill rides with its loud music and edge of your seat, fake scenes. Fortunately those sequences are only a small, ignorable part of the grandiose film. The wonders of space and imagination simply needed to stay within that theme to capture the audience; instead these wonders become diminished by implementing Hollywood drama and emotions expressed by the astronauts chosen to embark on the mission. Feeling a bit miscast, when seeing Ann Hathaway (who plays one of the astronauts) putting on her singing in Les Miserable face, also Matt Damon, and even Mathew McConaughey (despite decent acting from him), led the mesmerizing journey into the unknowns of our universe(successfully accomplished in 2001, where its sterility from its astronauts made the actual outer-space become more of the character), to a mood that is a bit more ordinary and mainstream than some may hope for. I guess I personally wished for a slightly different film, one that didn't need to dwell as much on the human emotional world and chose to be where the setting actually was in outer space. A film explaining a bit more about the scientific phenomenon going on in planet earth that led to the need to seek out habitable planets and more explanations of what is going on in space. By the conclusion, there was a typical Nolanesque, mind bending, brain twisting conclusion challenging the audience to decipher what happened. The truth is the conclusion might be genius and really work brilliantly if it is able to be correctly understood or it might be something meant to be subject to interpretation. These tarnishes could not hold back the film from reaching and attaining those outer-limits. Since the premise and story were undeniably there and visually we were exposed to the imagination of the wonders and awe of space, time and other dimensions.",9,0,3,10 November 2014
American Hustle," fun plastic world
","In this exaggerated, over the top world the human drive is to get one over and out hustle the fellow man. The hustle is the theme of life in this 1970s New York City world. The convoluted plot was fun to follow, seeing where it meanders with tensions intensifying ultimately crescendo-ing into chaotic surprises. The chaos of the film may reflect the chaos the characters are feeling as the 'hustle' ignites and explodes into danger. A boring beginning with not the most thrilling characters ever created evolves into a more fun tricky plot. In order to preserve the mystery of the hustle we must be kept at a distance from some of the characters. We are never quite able to enter some of their heads until the very end, so throughout the movie the characters are vague and lack substance in our eyes. This distancing makes connecting with them difficult. So you ultimately don't really care too much about these characters.American Hustle glorifies its actors and actresses. The overly exalted Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence are showcased in many scenes strutting their stuff with haughty confidence and moxy in slow motion. These are all good actors and I'd like to see them brought into more of a reality instead of put on pedestals and thrust down our throats. Overall each of the actors had their moments and at other times they were over the top. American Hustle can be watched for a fun plot that makes you think during the viewing about the motivations of the characters and who is trying to hustle who. And afterwards the thinking continues as you digest and connect the dots to the puzzle that was just witnessed.",6,0,5,23 December 2013
Hugo," Dreamlike
","Beautiful sets and costumes, alongside stunning CG/3D technology transport us into the visually wondrous world of Hugo.The story seemingly about a young boy who is living in a train station working the clock evolves into a story about a filmmaker. A bit children's adventure and a bit mystery the story achieves a childlike wonder as you watch the clues and story unfold to nice surprises, satisfying conclusions and resonations of commentary concerning the preservation of film itself. Hugo is about nostalgia, nostalgia for Paris in a romantic period, the nostalgia for seeing movies for the first time as a child, and nostalgia for old films themselves.It was a nice, pleasant story that seems a bit contrived and forced forward at times. The transitions in the plot were not smooth and happened so randomly that it pragmatically seemed like a stretch; however Hugo should not be watched for its absolute realism. The story as the visuals itself are surrealistic, beautifully imaginative and semi-realistic therefore transporting us to dreamlike Paris in the early part of the 20th century. The imagery and story itself feel as though you are in a dream which makes the contrived plot acceptable.A delightfully nostalgic calmness resonates as we sense the old fashion flavor in conjunction with the old ragtime music similar to what would be heard and seen when experiencing an old silent film from around the turn of the century (20th century).The softening of the typical contemporary edgy themes created an old fashioned, relaxed, slower paced flavor yet the innovated CG and 3D make it more modern than almost any movie of it day. The 3D effects enhance the experience. You feel as though you are walking into highly populated hallways, up towers, you feel like you are in clocks peering out over the dazzling, wintry, romantic city of lights and you can not help but crack up as Sasha Baron Cohen's face comes closer and closer to your own as he once again scolds the protagonist. The assortment of extras dressed to the nines in outfits of the time, the small side stories and mini romances such as between the train's security guard and the flower girl created details that make Hugo a nice, encompassing, well crafted film.",9,4,8,5 December 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Ultimate Contemporary Film Noir
","The ultimate contemporary film noir was created as modern information gathering and communication techniques took us through an evolving mystery that was filled with interesting characters. The dark story and Gothic style created an edgy moodiness that enhanced the intrigue and made an exciting experience. The mystery was multi-layered, well thought out and although a bit horrifically fantastical was still absorbing. There is a tremendous level of decadence and perversion in this mystery which had similar overtimes to the classic Silence of the Lambs. It focuses in on, what I heard was an alternative title to the novel, violence against women. And one of the most intense revenge sequences that not only menacingly satisfies but at the same time smartly adds a level of momentum created one of the best individual scenes of the past year.Even more than the intriguing mystery, the creation of one of the most mesmerizing, interesting characters enhanced the experience. A thrilling character to get to know, the 'Girl' became the ultimate strong anti-hero/feminist even more so and more developed than 'the Bitch' in Kill Bill and Sigourney Weaver's character in the Alien movies. Richly dark and edgy her Gothic anti-society appearance blended well with the way she holds herself; angst ridden and moody. Despite the evilly rebellious exterior she is incredibly technologically savvy, brilliant, tough, and nearly fearless. She has a fiercely independent sense of self. The sense of self made her confident and self-actualized sexually yet adding a layer to this greatness was a level of vulnerability. Her vulnerability was not only the traumatic kind, but simply the minor kind which we all have in our lives and can relate to. The kind where minor imperfection and mishaps occur, the kind where she can't get exactly what she wants, the stuff which we all experience. This created a relatable individual despite her renegade appearance, and almost supersonic abilities and therefore she is a character we feel for and understand. We got to know this soul as she merged with the intriguing mystery.There was an initial switching back and forth between the mystery and the character creation. This blended well together so that there was never a dull moment.The story was a bit horrifically over the top and the abilities, almost powers of the 'girl' put the movie on a borderline reality/fantastical realm. The character's strength and sexiness will be hard to forget.",9,1,4,9 January 2012
Tropic Thunder," Some cheap thrills
","Seeing a fat, bald, hairy Tom Cruise intensely moving to hip hop music after ferociously roaring at his underlings may give a cheap thrill but it will not make a decent movie.This movie had a few such cheap thrills that do make you smile and even laugh out loud, however the movie seemed so recklessly made that I would not recommend seeing it, at least in the theaters.The movie starts with several fake movie previews of the made up actors that give you an idea of who they are. There is a low brow B action movie hero, a wildly messy stooger like comedian that specializes in bodily noises and another self indulgent 'serious' actor.The laughter continues as the actual movie starts and we witness these actors making a Vietnam War movie. Seeing the dramatic way Speedo (Ben Stiller's character) is shot and a few other spoofs, brilliantly and hilariously satirize Vietnam War movies.After the 15 minutes of fake previews and the Vietnam War movie spoofs, it unfortunately digresses into the story created. Perhaps it was part of the joke to create such a ridiculously stupid story, showing Tom Cruise dancing one minute and Jack Black shooting the Vietnamese in his underwear the next, but it also seemed so high budget and cinematically sweeping with beautiful cinematography of the exotic Vietnamese jungles that it seems as though this movie did not know where it wanted to be. It was also so recklessly made or edited that you barely know what is going on. This is perhaps purposefully done to distract us from the nonsensical story.However, it did contain one of the most hilarious, laugh out loud starts of a movie and a few cheap thrills.",5,4,9,20 August 2008
No Country for Old Men," Moody, Dark and Grim
","Coen Brothers created a moody film with a very grim, dark theme that will haunt its viewers who fully capture the meaning. The eerily grim mood is sustained from the dead desolate landscapes, minimal dialogue, sinister characters and a far from Hollywood ending that sustains and enhances the mood and resonates after the viewing.The theme is that of the inevitability and randomness of death which is metaphorically represented by Javier's character that is more grim reaper than human, he stops at nothing and frighteningly appears out of no where. He is big, brooding, socially odd, cold, warped, eerily calm and apathetic yet confident in his power and his fear. His abnormal peculiarities become apparent as he interacts with people, the weapon of choice and his hair style. His interactions allow us to somewhat get into his warped yet interesting brain and to somewhat learn his philosophy behind his motivations.Containing a Hitchcockian style suspense for our times is where this movie shines. The suspense is due to the hauntingly menacing character and the modern, masterfully executed suspense scenes that were reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock.Extremely careful attention must be paid to Tommy Lee Jones' character since he expresses the ideas of the movie and challenges the audience to understand his mumbling southern drawl or dialect. .The story is about someone finding some money and a psychopathic killer that wants to get the money back killing some people that get in his way. And that is it. There are holes in this meager plot and it is unclear what exactly is going on at certain points. Also, belief has to be suspended as to how these people always find each other in random locations. But the movie is not so much about the story as it is about the mood and the theme. You will either ill-fatedly cross death's path (metaphorically represented by Javier's character) and die, or you will eventually die anyway from growing old. Â– Bleak.",8,1,3,16 January 2008
Bridesmaids," Finally Females
","The soulfully, relatable comedy is nicely blended with over the top crass, crude humor. The amusingly unique movie plays out from the female standpoint and mentality and that differs from movies of this kind that are typically based upon the male psyche. It is up there with the best of the irreverent, nasty comedies of this genre such as the Hangover, Knocked up and Superbad. By creating a cynical theme, due to the melancholy, jealousy and nihilism that the friend believably feels from the occurrence of her bff getting married, a crass/slapstick comedy evolves into a dark and sophisticated one. When a Bff gets married resulting in the inevitable 'growing apart' while at the same time the friend not getting married feels as though she is going nowhere a soulfully bluesy mood resonates. The acting amongst the main characters, especially their connection with each other was well done. The assortment of side characters and bridesmaids were well developed. We really cared about these supporting characters since their own histories, and idiosyncratic personality traits created complex eccentrically believable personas. Especially amusing were the heavy set bridesmaid and the policeman. Finally the typical plague that frequently decimates movies of the genre, the overlong sappy 'tie things neatly together' moments, did not go on too long. Instead what was wisely focused on was crude, slapstick humor, developed side characters and real connections between friends.",8,1,4,20 May 2011
Gone Girl," New Film Genre
","Similar to this filmmakers other films such as Fight Club and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo the dark anti-societal theme and sort of pseudo-realistic film noir genre are present in this movie. The anti-society theme in Gone Girl is the dark, eerie commentary on marriage.This along with the director's other films seem to create a new film genre. This new genre contains elements of film-noir/thriller/horror/comedy/fantasy yet it can not really be described as any of those. Gone Girl has a superb exciting flow and it was unpredictable if you did not read the book and don't know the story.Gone Girl is about a missing wife, the search for her and the mystery of her disappearance. There was nothing typical about this seemingly mundane sounding mystery premise. The whole film, its theme and story reflect and comment on the darkness of marriage. This commentary on marriage is satirically, darkly humorous as well. It asks the question, do we really know what our spouse thinks. It was a well created film that is unpredictable if you did not read the book or know the story however the film was not without flaws. The pseudo-realism creates improbable events that are difficult to swallow. The unconvincing pseudo-realism works less in Gone Girl than other movies like Girl with Dragon Tattoo and fight club because Gone Girl was more of a mystery than the other films and less of a fantasy. The whole film was mystery so what I expected is more realism. The settings seem to be realistic but the story ends up in this realm that is so far from reality that it is almost a fantasy. I did not believe the practically supersonic abilities to manipulate the circumstances that the wife had.Another flaw was that there was no connection to the wife and her monstrously diabolical persona. This was a problem since we were granted a window into her past through flashbacks yet no understanding of how she became a truly menacing character.Overall a unique interesting film that was really well created. It thematically commented on the possibility of the truly dark, eerie side of marriage. It holds interest with the unpredictable story and curiosity created from the odd characters.",8,2,10,26 October 2014
Django Unchained," Tarantino Epic
","By incorporating a multitude of thematic Tarantino elements Django is the best Tarantino movie SINCE Pulp Fiction. Not as good as that great movie since this one is a little more bloated and less novel, it nonetheless is Tarantino's second best movie. This was great because it used many of the best aspects of the other Tarantino films. Such as the friendship between a black and white antihero (a hit-man like in Pulp Fiction but now the male bonding is as bounty hunters), also the violence art similar to Kill Bill and the Gut Warming, heart pounding, pulpy thrill of revenge against an evil like in Inglorious Bastards. There were many other aspects of Tarantino's movie in this one. To start off the complete unpredictability is what really draws you in. You really do not know what is going to happen next which is refreshing to those that frequently see movies. The episodic scenes have such a high degree of unpredictability that it mesmerizingly keeps us on the edge of our seats.There were some really amazing characters created which was not wholly due to the writer/director but the great actors who infused their talent into the roles. These characters' eccentricities were so unique that you might have never seen characters like this before. A trademark oddity in how they spoke, what they said and their ultimate actions reflected without any creative barriers the moviemaker's soul. If you thought Christopher Waltzes and Jamie Foxx's character were great wait till you get to DiCaprios and Samuel L Jacksons. You really wanted to see more of these characters despite the nearly 3 hour length of this Tarantino epic. Dicaprio's character was probably the best; he was so amusing with his warped, semi-depraved, megalomaniac eccentricity. DiCaprios acting was really good here too. Samuel L Jackson can blurt out the necessary profanities with the appropriate rawness making him the perfect actor for some of Tarantino's parts.The greatest thing is the psychological aspects to these characters and how that plays out in the scenes. There is actually a lot of psychology going on which builds multi-dimensional characters and creates scenes of intense unpredictability. There were other scenes of brilliant hilarity mocking the dark side of the old south, or genre film itself. As the movie progressed and where it could have ended well and uniquely alas a contrived scene was thrown in to showcase Tarantino's signature brand of violence art, reminiscent of Kill Bill. This weakened the movie as a whole and made it drag however it was pure fun to witness the slow motion blood splattering and detailed depiction of body parts being shot with blood shooting out like geysers drenching the place in red.I think I heard Tarantino is criticized for rehashing old movies or copying from other films. I guarantee whether or not that is the case you've never seen something like this before.",9,210,394,26 December 2012
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The Passage of Time
","Not the traditional concrete story but rather an amalgam of experiences at random but defining stages of age.We all know the plot (a man born physically old and matures physically backwards to youth), yet it is interesting to see old man buttons acting and interacting with the sensibility of a child and progressing towards mental maturity contrasting with his reverse physical development.That is really all there is; aspects of a man's life climaxing in the 'meeting in the middle' with his soul mate that he met in childhood. There is nothing extraordinary about him (besides the obvious reverse aging), no adversity to be overcome, no battles to be fought no achievement strived for nor was there any heavy drama yet the story is still so profound and compelling since it is about the most grand, universal themes, which is the passage of time, age, aging and change. The nostalgic aura of these themes and the steady pace create a mesmerizing, mellow mood that allow us, as we slowly witness Buttons' interesting progression, to simultaneously internalize these themes to our own life.This well made movie due to the state of the art make up and special effects that miraculously transform these appealing good actors into different ages, more so than has ever been done before, along with the well imagined love story, also partly as a result of the appealing good actors, overshadow the minor weaknesses. The failure to truly encase us in the various time periods and the simple/easy way out for making Buttons as an aged but visibly youthful child gives the impression that the creators got a little lazy, however, it is mere nitpicking to point out these weaknesses as the evocative mood we feel and the grand themes remain unaltered.",8,0,1,2 January 2009
The Dark Knight," Dark and Earthy Superhero
","This less than perfect action movie with a similar 'action movie' formula and a confusing, convoluted story is enhanced by the appeal of Batman and the realistic way this superhero movie is made.One appeal stems from an earthy realism. It is the superhero movie for those that prefer realism to fantasy. The moody darkness is sustained throughout by dwelling on the conflicted Batman and the idiosyncratic villains. These various aspects transform a good action movie into the greatest superhero movie.Batman's own inner turmoil, limitations, indecisiveness make him more down to earth and relatable than those with kryptonic/other worldly powers. This Superhero is brought into our realm by his own moral issues that plague his decision making, his self doubt about himself and what he is doing with his life and his lack of any true superpower (his strength comes from training and kept in human terms and his skills come from technological gadgets).Even more than Batman himself, the colorful assortment of thematic villains is the most fascinating aspect of Batman and this movie. The way these villain's lose their sense of sanity from some trauma and take it out in horrifically menacing ways that are characteristic of their idiosyncratically warped minds has never been as realistically imagined and portrayed as in this Batman Series. This realism is what makes it better, more believable and the most frightening. This Joker will be one of the most hauntingly creepy, sinister and sadistic characters ever created in film. His eerie lunacy, vocalized by the psychotic laugh, masks and yet enhances his black soul.",8,4,12,5 August 2008
Into the Wild," Quest for meaning
","An idealistic, perhaps immature, young man embarks on a journey both logistically, through America and spiritually, within his own soul.The movie chronicles his travels, the people he encounters and friends he makes, while exploring his motivation behind abandoning all. He abandons his family, friends and any people he encounters in which he gets along so well with. People really have an empathy and love for him. Yet he feels the need to abandon all that is good to reach his destination and isolation  Alaska. The movie hints at this motivation, but it remains somewhat unclear to the audience, as it would be to anyone as I'm sure it was to the man himself. Upon speculation some conclusions can be drawn, such as; the need to prove himself and make himself a better man (if he can survive with nothing in the wild he can survive anywhere), soul searching for happiness, perhaps running from something such as family problems (and probably something undocumented and unknown to anyone), the adventure and experience.Critics may claim, with some merit, that this is just a spoiled selfish young man. Why care for someone like this who hurts his family and loved ones for some egotistical meanderings. However aren't faulty characters the truest expression of humanity? Can't we see reflections of this person in others and even ourselves to some degree? The character is clearly seeking out something Grandiose, something bigger than family, friends and human interaction, some all encompassing meaning of life. As opposed to other movies seemingly attempting to satiate our appetites for these grandiose answers but just wets our appetite by feeding us vague tastes at meanings in order to purposely make us ponder, this movie satisfyingly portrays the young man's and story's subjective belief of an answer, leaving the audience fulfilled. The ending is very fulfilling as the young man attains his Wisdom.The scenery is beautiful containing many shots of the most beautiful, alien landscapes I know of in the World, the West. The movie was a little slow and dragged. It was very poignant for better or for worse.I think this young man's quest is something we can all admire and make a part of ourselves in a lesser degree.",8,2,5,3 January 2008
Avatar," Safely Done
","The 3d special effects are a marvel that will encapsulate you inside the cockpit of a futuristic helicopter, give you the point of view of a marine embarking on a new world and completely immerse you in a foreign planet. The 3D aspect makes the movie worth seeing, however the much anticipated and hyped otherworldly experience is safely kept on our own world. The environment is a richly lush jungle where some of the plants do mildly quirky things. The creatures are derivatives of dinosaurs or horses or other earth bound animals. The attractive 'aliens' are tall humanoids that are safely exotic with light blue skin and cute tails. The alien's society easily mocks societies that we are familiar with. The imagination with such a project could have truly taken us to the outer-limits and that would be fascinating when paired with innovative 3D special effects instead we are still kept mostly earthbound. There is some imagination such as the natives interesting kinship to nature and the visually stunning, romantically glowing forest at night but the makers were relatively safe and too frightened to frighten us away. Alas, we still remain on Earth, despite the 'promise' to take us to a new world. The story could have really taken off to the furthest stretches of the imagination unfortunately few risks were taken in this department as well and we are presented with something very crowd pleasing and conventional. We've seen this predictable cookie cutter storyline in other movies and the lack of innovation will prevent this from being a classic. Simple cartoonish characters unrealistically and unbelievably portray humans in the future. Can I really suspend my belief that people in the future will choose to start a war and destroy an alien race over some mineral or will humans of the future rather get more of a reward of studying such a species? Audience will be forced to dumb-down their minds to the comic bookie state, take the movie for what it is and enjoy the spectacular special effects and new 3D technology. The movie was really about the 3D special effects which will generate an 'oh cool' sentiment without distracting us from the story. Despite all this it is still an entertaining, more summery, popcorn, blockbuster.",7,2,8,21 December 2009
The Artist," Contemporary Silent Film a Classic?
","The artist is a smartly crafted tribute to movies from the silent era. Everything from the sets, to hair and outfits to the overly exaggerated expressions, to even the late 20s mentality brought us back to movies from that time period. The actors expertly emphasized the over the top emotions which are needed since verbal expression is not possible. The as minimal as possible shots of written words to convey a statement, as was done in silent films from the past, was a fun aspect that showed how minor a role words actually play in order to convey a story by film.It was a nice tribute and it excellently mocked those old silent movies however The Artist is not a classic as those old silent films are. I think when a silent film is revisited it is not so much for its entertainment value but rather for its value as a classic as a art form in its infancy, perhaps to get a sense of the time period or perhaps to touch on film history by witnessing legendary actors or filmmakers. It was impossible for The Artist to achieve this level or any level of nostalgic classic nor will it since it is a contemporary parody.As a silent film and as a mimic of those old silent films it had a cumbersome pacing at times. It was rather light hearted and didn't have as much as that interesting psychological dark edge as other similar stories that explored a Hollywood star that is once on top, loses it all and is no longer relevant has; think Sunset Boulevard. There were also much more entertaining movies made about the advent of talkies and the impact it had on actors from the time period, think Singing in the Rain.The Artist is mildly entertaining, with a premise that felt revisited. It was a comfortable tribute that expertly recreated films from the 1920s.",6,13,27,28 December 2011
Super 8," No Wonder and No Charm
","Overall has the feel of the run-of-the-mill disaster movie with a mindless story and corny special effects. The makers failed to recreate the intended retro/sci-fi speilbergesque feel.The main reason was the awful story created that had tremendous holes and things that don't make sense even for something that isn't realistic. It didn't stick to anything as the movies it was trying to recreate did. The old Spielberg movies stuck to a unique premise with a wondrous charm and fun sense of adventure. Premises such as interesting children's adventure saga, a huge Shark, dinosaurs or some mysterious aliens is what made you want to go the movies. These premises were unique at the time, fun and had tons of heart. Super 8 on the other hand tried to throw everything in there, all the Spielberg premises ultimately creating nothing. It was just a special effects movie centered around a nonsensical story with a few of Spielberg's old techniques thrown in and none of his heart.Frequently there were those annoying (and in this case gratuitous) 'jolting awake' moments occurring from a span of quietness followed by something drastic happening that created a sudden loud bang.The children trying to make a movie were mildly cute but it lacked intrigued because that aspect didn't get into enough depth since it had to go into the more boring, corny over the top special effect areas. The ending got absolutely ridiculous even for something that is fantasy/sci-fi.",3,1,3,23 June 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," Contemporary War Movie
","Appealing to delve into the freshness of portraying this most contemporary of wars. This is a war movie and it is one of the first Hollywood ones dealing with the War against Al-Qaeda. Similar to how the climax of WWII culminated in D-day this is the first big movie showcasing the climax of the war against al-Qaeda (dropping the elite 6 over Ben-Laden's house) and like the many portrayals of D-Day in the history of cinema there will likely be other portrayals of the elite six coming down and getting Ben-Laden. A war not so much about troops or arms or traditional battles of armies but rather a clandestine war consisting of sly CIA operatives and fanatical terrorist leaders hiding from the world. Victories and defeats not won or lost by traditional army battles but by achievements in intelligence or thwarted efforts to gain knowledge, continued concealment leading to more acts of terrorism. The beginning shows one of the battles of this contemporary war as an American operative tries to gain information through use of torture. Interestingly exposed is the strategy to gain information through the mechanism of torture. It shows how we did it and raises questions as to the morality of it. The movie did not leave the morality open for the audience but provided its biased interpretation of the situation. Innovative to make a detailed account of this contemporary war however this innovation might be giving this film more accolade than it deserves and although a very good movie not the best one of the year. More sterile historical lesson than cinematic experience as the step-by-step detailed process in getting Ben-Laden moving through the scattered military bases seemed well researched yet long, not completely thrilling and at times a bit confusing. The protagonist was the driving soul of this movie slowly becoming more and more driven, obsessed? with her goal of getting Ben Laden this was to the detriment of anything else in her life especially human interaction. She had vulnerability but a mere couple of minutes was devoted to making a real character thus the sterile feel was not only in how the story was told but was also infused into the main character. She ultimately became more symbol than human being. I do not know if one person was behind all this intelligence gathering it is hard to believe that all these years it could be one person yet the movie made it seem that it was all on this woman's shoulders. This gave Zero Dark Thirty a feminist quality by having this woman becoming the symbol and visual connotation of the CIAs secretive war against Al-Qaeda. The men either couldn't hack the intensity of the tortures and wanted to go back home, were far less committed and driven or were mere subservient foot soldiers for the female protagonists. The male soldiers were literally her arms as in a scene she touches one of them on command so that he would punch the victim being tortured. Even the elite 6 felt like extensions of this female protagonist. It was interesting to give this movie this feminist quality but it didn't seem realistic, not because it was female but because it seemed like there was only one person trying to get Ben-Laden.It was immersive, there were some nice scenes transporting us to the middle east as we see the desert towns and hear the call to prayer. A well researched, well made, immersive movie about this freshly portrayed contemporary war.",8,7,25,7 January 2013
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Party in NYC, 2008
","A romantic comedy that portrays a contemporary slice of youthful culture in New York City. The cute, charismatic actors and actresses are an appealing part of this typical not so interesting story. What is interesting is the believable, somewhat realistic portrayal of the youthful, 'hip' culture of NYC nightlife. Contemporary music, styles and attitudes give a 'slice of life' and feel of the pace, place and the times. It rings very close to home, witnessing the abysmal drunkenness of the scantily clad night goers, slopping around the train station like hungry, nauseated and tired animals, waiting for the late night train back to the burbs. As the kids drive around we witness many of the NYC landmarks, not the statue of liberty and Lincoln Center type landmarks, but rather, those bars lounges and eateries infamous to the downtown night hoppers.It's the type of movie when viewed several years or decades in the future will render a 'oh my, what were we thinking back then' in reference to the styles, music and culture such as we do today when we watch 80s movies.Movie also contained one of the most amusingly, putrid scenes ever caught on film that makes you turn your head in disgust but since it fosters that unique reaction it is for the better.",7,1,5,17 October 2008
There Will Be Blood," Grandiose Classic
","A throwback to great movies from decades ago with superior character acting, bombastic musical scores, grandiose cinematography and deliberate, but by no means slow or boring, pacing. Pacing that takes you and immerses you for quite some time into the setting and the period.The cinematography, direction and score all are great but will most likely stand out in history after the movie becomes a classic is the superb acting. Daniel Day Lewis's performance ranks amongst the greatest acting by Brando, Pacino, Nicklaus etc. It is a little over the top and not completely realistic however, the nuanced facial expressions showing a variety of emotions at the same time, the unique talk and the stumbled and hunch walk become Lewis' own artistic portrayal of Daniel Plainview's essence.The deliberate, suspenseful pacing along with the intense music and slightly artistic - not so Hollywood spin was reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's movies. Similar to Kubrick's movies the slower pacing is not detrimental to entertainment since it 'brings you there' for more than a moment and allows you to ponder as you watch. This is a far cry from the instant gratification style of entertainment from most of the movies nowadays.The music and acting created an exciting earnestness in the beginning as we witness Plainview make his deals and drill for oil. He is a shrewd businessman and it is interesting to see how he conducts his business and get what he wants.The larger than life period piece could have gone anywhere and been about a multitude of things such as Plainview's business dealings, how he got his land, started drilling, his ideas on how to transport the oil, people who tried to take advantage of his fortune, the people he had to appease or even a commentary about the evils of capitalism. It did go into a lot of these topics but it did not dwell on them. Going into all this may have made it unwieldy or as some movies do, seem like it was trying to tackle too much and as a result sacrificing depth. The writer/director wisely focused on the most interesting theme which was the character Plainview's dark consciousness and internal agony.He wages a war against his tortured conscious. Since no one is any competition or poses any threat to Plainview's ingenious business savvy and skills, his only real enemy or obstacle is his own heart and soul. He is strong enough to ignore his tortured consciousness on his own and punishes himself in his own way by sleeping on the ground and never enjoying any comforts or pleasures that his wealth brings. That is why the main antagonist and other main character is not some other person who might encumber his business but rather the one that makes him aware of his conscience and his sin. The priest represents a tangible, unavoidable, actual being that forces Plainview to confront his demons. The priest is literally thrust into Plainview's face forcing him to actually see and hear the representative of the institution which absolves sin and cleanses consciousness, the church.The ending may be confusing and is highly criticized but if you keep the theme of the tortured spirit in mind you will understand the point of the final battle and the main point of the movie.",10,3,14,8 January 2008
The Wolf of Wall Street," Debaucherous Bliss
","Playful without taking itself too seriously, the Wolf of Wall Street knows exactly where it belongs and it is a finely executed and well made movie. We are brought into a fake looking fantasy world of debauchery bliss. This is not the film to explain the inner workings of wall street or what an IPO is or how exactly the company makes money from exploiting people. DiCaprio says outright speaking to our faces, 'you don't care about this technical stuff lets just say I'm making a lot of money and its illegal' - YEEEAAY! And that expresses the point – follow me on a roller coaster ride of extraordinary decadent, nasty, fun, the kind that those of us in this business get to have. The movie doesn't show the hard work that is done to make the millions it only explores the fantasy that the millions brings to these young eccentric personalities that make it big fast. It is not satirical, nor is it a down to earth slice of life tale or even a much of commentary it is mostly pure playful entertainment. Over the Top Caricatures are created as opposed to real people which add to surrealism. DiCaprio as the leader and Jonah Hill as the sidekick are an amusing frat boy/wallstreety combo that opens up new levels of laughably painful debauchery throughout the entire three hours. The plot moves fast but the pace is well managed since time slows and we can witness wonderfully creative, amusing scenes of the raw over-the-top decadence in its full manifestations. These scenes have a pseudo-realistic flavor and therefore are more laughable than anything else. The invincible arrogance of DiCaprio's character is a lot of fun to follow. He knows he is doing wrong and seems to relish in the evil of it. Women are degraded and co-workers are humiliated in this dog eat dog machismo company that the Wolf creates and the Wolf loves every minute of it. There is only one brief instant when he becomes almost stupefied by his unbelievable invisibility. This character trait doesn't really glorify wall street since it shows these types to be so perverse and not only corrupt but inherently a bit evil, a bit sick in the head. Scorcese is making fun of them by showcasing them in ridiculous sequences of slow motion while they are under the influence of this weird drug qualudes, that the film goes into. The exaggerated affect also gives a playfully over-the-top tease to these wall street types and that is what makes it different from other movies in this Wall street genre that took themselves more seriously. The fantasy of the pure debauchery bliss might seem glorious to some of us but overall most of us, I think, will root for the Feds getting the Wolf. This is another extremely enjoyable highly re-watchable movie. Like during a late Sunday afternoon of channel flipping when you stumble on other Scorsese greats, such as Good-fellas or Casino, which ushers you into stopping for an indulgent peak, and all of the sudden finding yourself once again for the 10th time becoming so engrossed that you can't help but to continue watching to the end.",9,2,8,12 January 2014
American Gangster," Fun and exciting but seen it before
","One of the good gangster/mob epics, this movie is long and needs to be that way since it attempts to tackle two stories and two protagonists. However, despite the length the intensity and story will keep you engrossed throughout. It is the true life story of a crime boss in Harlem and an honest NYC detective fighting the drug war. One is a mob boss portrayed more as a businessman than a crook and has a very professional approach. The way he figures how to get, import and sell cheaper higher quality drugs than his competition is an interesting story. The other main character is an extremely honest detective whom is embedded in a profession filled with corruption. He is honest in his profession perhaps to compensate for the moral dilemma he faces from being dishonest in his personal life. A major theme of the movie was the corrupt policemen at the time in NYC who were taking bribes from drug dealers and taking advantage of the situation for their own personal benefit. This may remind you of a movie.The fact that it reminded me of another movie and many movies was a weakness of this particular film. It took ideas and themes from Serpico  the corrupt policeman, Scarface the rise and fall of power of an intense personality, Goodfellas the rise and fall of a gangster and the ratting out, and Heat with the oscillating story of the cop and gangster. I literally saw scenes being repeated. This movie wasn't as good as those older movies because it combined what all those movies did and therefore forfeited depth in any one particular theme. It was also not innovative by any means. However a very fun entertaining movie experience is created when all these elements of those great movies are put together and as a delightful relish the acting was good.",7,0,2,3 January 2008
The Wrestler," The art of realism
","A movie about a professional wrestler is ironically a slice of life tale about a relatable, down to earth, common man. A universal theme of a man who's seen his prime come and go. A man trying to reconcile age with his profession, reconnect with his estranged daughter and form some sort of relationships and romance. Despite being of this extravagantly, oddly, special profession of a wrestler, everyday people will relate to the earthiness felt in this tale and moodily connect with the wintry nowhere Jersey.We become exposed to the insides of the wrestling world, the fakeness of it, as we watch the 'combatants' shake hands and fraternize before and after the bout, and the brutal realism of it, of the excruciatingly painful (even to watch) consensual physical torture just in order to get a rise out of the crowd.The story doesn't amount to much but it is the art of realism. Effectively filmed like a reality show or home video with a shaky lower budget camera which gave the feeling of rawness, grittiness and simplicity taking us to the Wrestler's level. Simplicity in a movie can be profoundly powerful. But it must not get too simple where substance will be forfeited. This movie just toted that line and rose slightly above the 'too simple' threshold.The poetic feel of an earthy bluesiness transpires from such scenes as when the father and daughter as they try to reconnect stroll along the isolated boardwalks in the wintry Jersey beach. We are enveloped by a delightful melancholy as we become warmed by these soft scenes and the character's gentleness and heart. These scenes contrast dramatically to the wrestling matches and the character's size and identity and underlying macho-ism. There are some flaws such as lack of development with the supporting characters. You especially wanted to know and feel more for Marisa Tomei's part and the lack of development in her character made it feel a bit empty. It seems far fetched that a Pro wrestler, one with a fan base, supposedly big star decades ago, with posters and action figures, that this larger than life 'idol?', is so destitute that he has to live in a trailer (granted I am not familiar with pro wrestler's economic situation). . Maybe this should have been explained more, did he squander all his money, does he not make that much, does he not care to spend it? The flaws don't scathe the root of the movie, like the pleasure derived when listening to the husky, raw voice of a great blues musician craning out the simplest lyrics, which is the art and poetry of realism",7,7,10,26 December 2008
Inception," More confusing than interesting
","A blockbuster, star studded extravaganza with a somewhat imaginative yet an overwhelmingly more confusing and contrived premise. The audience is expected to enter this contrived sci-fi?, dream world where Juno is able to architect dreams (why her character I didn't pick up), and Leo's character can extract information or do the more complicated thing of putting an idea into someones mind 'inception'. Continuously saturated with fun, 'A'list actors one after another; Leo, Michael Caine, Juno, Joseph Gordan-Levitt, Ken Watanabe these actors were used as mere tools to create a blockbuster and drive the movie forward. As we get more and more immersed in the world of inception we feel no interesting characterizations despite all this acting talent, everyone is one tone, which makes you care less whether or not Leo is still dreaming at the end or not. After this matrixy like premise is explained, we are transported into this world, of entering and altering people's subconscious in dreamland. It has similar overtones to the Matrix (of heavily explaining ulterior worlds within our own), but this premise was far less fascinating.After the complicated premise is established the movie gets into the story. Leo has powers to extract information or alter someone's thinking by entering another individual's subconscious dreamworld. He gets an assignment from a powerful mogul to exploit and alter a competitor's mind through his dream. If Leo succeeds he gets to travel back to the states where he has been deported. The movie did not do a good job connecting the premise of how people enter dreams and plant ideas to the story. OK so this idea of conducting inception in dream world is established but does it have to get into 3-4 dream sequences? Its more complicated to do inception than steal info out of someones mind so something more has to be done than getting into people's minds on one level but confusingly layering dreams within dreams within dreams, confusing establishing various rules with this more complicated inception world (I barely understood the easier stealing info world), confusingly adding side stories of his wife he doesn't want to let go of and therefore retains in his personal dream and making confusing action and fighting (who they are fighting is also part of the puzzle) made it much too much. These things are actually explained but they are explained so briefly and rapidly along with many other 'rules' we have to accept that it became a lot, easy to miss and not well put together. More than imagination it was randomness....Why 3 levels why not 8 or 2 why does it have to be 3 levels (the movie I think explained this but what Im critical of is the imaginative part, it was just too random to get really into), if Juno can flip the grid of Paris why cant she do something to make it easy for them to accomplish their goal. The limitations or freedoms were not clear. What it utlimately came down to was an action movie. Definitely after a second viewing the pieces may more clearly fit, but for me at least, the puzzle will remain askew.",5,2,7,20 July 2010
Iron Man," Fantasy Superhero
","Ironman's alter ego (Tony Stark) is a millionaire, playboy, genius/inventor with an off color sense of humor. Underneath his egotistical, cynical, comedic exterior is a noble heart for the larger things in life such as world peace. He even has Gwyneth Paltrow as an assistant who does ALL to service and please him. As Ironman he is the invincible beast who crushes the 'evil doers' like flies, soars through the air at supersonic speed to wherever he wants and has a sleek hotrod suit with all the gadgets you would want. Not only is he the superhero inside the suit but he is the inventor as well. This is the ideal fantasy superhero, the type of superhero you would want to be and that is the fun of it. Smartly made in a not to be taken too seriously fashion since the overall mood is tongue and cheek, contains moments of Three Stooges type slapstick (when he first attempts to upgrade his suit), and the unlikely superhero Robert Downey Jr. plays Ironman. All this means fun which prevails over the predictability and redundancy of this superhero movies. This is another scientist who instead of mutating to something supersonic builds his mechanical organism. Then the typical superhero movie formula ensues and it is just somewhat interesting. Despite being only somewhat interesting particularly since it doesn't have a very interesting character study with a history (like Batman and Spiderman do) and it lacks a cast of idiosyncratic villains (unlike Batman or Spiderman) it is still fun, well done and well directed. You'll have fun watching this fantasy play-out",7,1,2,14 May 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Brief wonderful trip to Barcelona
","Take a sojourn for a couple of hours to the romantic streets and country side of Barcelona. The beige pastel landscapes, the enchanted dreamlike streets, the surreal Gaudi monuments and amorous cafes all evoke a romantic escapade in Barcelona. Scenery and setting are an integral part of Woody's great films. As we typically see in Woody's films, like the movie Manhattan, where the sleepy streets and sites of grey, nostalgic New York take on a character of its own as the human characters discourse in front of it, we again feel his new European locale as though we are there ourselves. We are shown a lot of the defining sites of the culturally rich city.Woody is a genius at capturing the mindset of people, of the times, especially with regards to courting etiquette and he continues to brilliantly totally possess an understanding of and be able to pierce into contemporary times. He understands and documents real human emotion and these real people draw us into his movies and this one. He does it with a literary flair and although people don't actually talk like how he portrays them, it is amusing to listen to the literary rich dialogue. The movie resonates with Woody's philosophy and commentary with a tad of humor on his current theme of love and passion. By utilizing two contrasting personalities with contrasting view points on love and passion, woody makes an intriguing commentary on the subject. One with an indulgently bohemian outlook, boldly and constantly searches for the possibly unattainable or nearly impossible ideal which ultimately keeps her in hopeless situations and the other with a more conservative stance has more 'grounded and settled' ideals and dubiously believes in the happily ever after bit. Both polar opposites are presented an amusingly similar circumstance and it is fun to see how the situation unfolds. Then Penelope Cruz's character emerges as a spicy twist to the story.There is less humor in his later great movies than in the early ones and there is no longer any slapstick. But he still enjoys poking fun at his characters and since they are so believable he is poking fun at real people in a satirical way.One of the most interestingly beautiful movies this year so far. And definitely one of Woody's best.",9,7,16,25 August 2008
Inside Llewyn Davis," Tired Film
","The protagonist has his life sucked out of him due to failure from trying to make it in the music scene. And the only redeeming quality is the connection felt to this character since you will likely have the life sucked out of you after viewing.Its about a man trying to make it in the folk music scene in new York city. Inside Llewyn Davis needed but lacked something smart to envelopment the audience into the folk scene. It needed to present us with whats going on in that scene. If they couldn't do it technically (since all that was done regarding the setting was showing cold, muted colors and bleak dark environs that do not transport you anywhere except to a place of gloominess) they should have at least tried to put in some dialogue about the scene, a bit of a historical perspective, something about folk music itself, anything to get the audience into the 1960s folk scene setting which was what the movie was about. Perhaps the movie wasn't really about the folk music scene but rather a metaphor for the man who fails in his vocation. The film was about portraying a face that is not able to make it and perhaps the difficulty of trying to be a folk singer during that time period. The music was portrayed and listening to it was a delight and the only redeeming quality unfortunately is was barely discussed. The reason this film really fails is it exposes the worst of the worst film-making techniques and styles that the Coens are capable of. Quirky and boring caricature like characters that are trying to be amusing or maybe funny but you absolutely don't care about. Characters who are arbitrarily literally dropped out of the story which is OK because you don't care about them. There is really no character study of Lllewyn Davis he is sad, a little frustrated without very minimal backdrop to why he does what he does. The second major film-making problem was that it seemed put together in a very amateurish way since it has a disjointed feel, lacks flow, contains scenes of random nothingness infiltrated with characters of such banality. This was the worst Coen Film since the random characters which are sometimes amusing in their film were carelessly put in, had nothing of interest to say and completely failed to amuse. The random scenes in their films that usually don't fit in can sometimes have this quirky suspense about them but there was no suspense in this movie. The movie seemed lazily put together, the main character was tired and it may ultimately leave the audience tired. The only pleasantness derived from this is the actually folk music we get to hear. A complete song was played which is the only enjoyment I can foresee an audience deriving from this poorly put together depiction of bland misery. Devoting significant movie time to playing complete songs is also a problem. So the only good thing about this movie even added to the problems since by having a lot of time devoted to playing the complete song; the character development, the story and the substance were all forfeited.",3,11,20,30 December 2013
Her," Bland Sci-Fi/Romance
","This would have been an extremely bland, poorly written movie if it were not for the unique premise. A premise that gets imaginative and asks the question about where our society is heading. The question posed is just how close are we going to get with technology? Are we going to have a real intimate relationship with it/her? Movie did a good job reflecting that idea as the main character becomes virtually lost within his relationship. He is so possessed by the operating system (as we are arguably becoming possessed by our technology) that it seems as though he is just waking up whenever he looks somewhere else or interacts with a 'real' person.You almost already 'know' the movie without having to see it because it really didn't go into a lot of territory. Brutally typical dialogue and tediously typical turn of events such as is portrayed in any run of the mill romantic movies became the essence of this film. The character was that one-toned, perpetually mellow, melancholic soul we've seen before (for example; Bill Murray in Lost in Translation). Long drawn out scenes of wistful sad faces further slows down the pace and holds back the potential of this premise.The Atmospheric filming style conjures a moody feel of the slowness and calmness of just waking up on a lazy Sunday morning and going outside into the sunny day. This meditative sensation felt by this technique was relaxing to watch and took the film out of the run of the mill territory.More could have been done with this nicely imagined sci-fi premise however, the character, the writing, the tone, the film itself muttered mediocrity.",6,5,15,27 December 2013
Slumdog Millionaire," Vastly different place
","It doesn't make sense that someone who succeeds on a game show (the Millionaire show) would succumb to beatings, torture and treatment as though he is a worthless dog due to suspicions of cheating. After all could not this person simply have been lucky in guessing the multiple choice questions correctly. We quickly realize how different things can be in a land different than our own.We do get a sense of the vastness of the country and how different it is than the west. Not only do we get this sense from the shocking way people are treated just from being of a lower class and from scenes of unfathomable squalor, but simply from the questions that are asked on the Millionaire show. When the basic, low value questions will be so obscurely vague to us if we are westerners, but are so rudimentary for Indians, and the hardest most obscure and highest value questions for the Indians are not that difficult for us, we realize the individuality of the country's culture, history and society. When a whole other world of a billion plus people can be obsessed by this person who might win it all, and we would never hear of him, we really feel the largeness of the world and how small we are in comparison.It is fast paced, lots of running and action packed. It seems a bit artificial as cheap thrills and raw entertainment took precedence over realism and a true immersion.The story could have simply been about life on the streets in India and what growing up was like for these 'slum dogs'. The cut to the millionaire aspects seems a bit gimmicky and almost oddly thrown in to make the movie more entertaining. It probably was more entertainment and crowd pleasing as a result of the Millionaire Show parts, but it did not create a more fulfilling cultural experience, as the best foreign films can be.",7,3,7,25 November 2008
The Social Network," Computer guys the new Rock Stars
","There will probably be a surge in computer science majors as we witness youthful, tech savvy, nerdy types emerge as the new rock stars of the 21st century. Their computer ingenuity and creativity lead them to fame, fortune and even groupies. A character study about someone who becomes a billionaire in his twenties is expertly blended with subject matter that is so relevant to our times results in one of the greatest movies of the past decade. The filmmakers and actors created such a believable Zuckerberg with such human emotions and motivations that we totally connect to this all too familiar, idiosyncratic, 'smuggy nerd' who fascinatingly becomes one of the billionaire rock stars of the information age. He is mentored by fellow internet rock star, Napster founder played by Timberlake. The subject matter of the business and legal ramifications of conjuring an online site raises interesting philosophical questions. Questions such as, who is really deserving; someone that comes up with the idea or the creator themselves, and how deserving is a confounder who plays a small financial role at the onset but who was nothing to do with the creative drive. These are some of the questions that will make the audience think about these contemporary issues. The dialogue written in a way where characters go tit for tat at unnaturally supersonic speeds was a throwback to Carey Grant classics, however, the modern edge and relevancy makes it engrossing, and ears will be fully opened to the intense verbiage.Amusingly tells the story of facebook founder's development and initial success with the site. Much of what he did in the initial founding years created controversy amongst those somewhat connected to the site and those wanting a piece of the pie. Two major legal disputes ensue and the film is structured through depositions dealing with these disputers. The haughty and annoyed Zuckerberg is visibly put off by these minor encumbrances and is seething to get back to his passion and baby (facebook). We hear of new controversies during the depositions and we see the flashbacks to the college years where these controversies got started which is a major part of the saga of the spawning and growth of facebook. The tad Gothic and moody atmosphere with the highly sensationalized decadence gives an entertaining if a little over the top feel to the collegiate setting. The movie opens and wraps up perfectly with a speculative, witty theme of the human component that creates the drive and motivation for these youthful internet entrepreneurs.",10,1,2,13 October 2010
The Fighter," More character than boxing
","More so than boxing it's about characters and choices. Choosing which people to listen to and retain in one's life is a theme we can all relate to. And even more than boxing this movie concerns itself with the people Micky Ward chooses to have in his corner both in the ring and in life. The seemingly selfish and misguided mother and the eccentric, loony brother control Micky's destiny perhaps devastating his potential to become a great boxer. A girl comes into Micky's life who helps Micky achieve clarity and provide him with womanly support. The ultimate choice Micky makes is not predictable and that sets it apart from the clichéd predictability of boxing movies.There are two character studies and as much as the movie is about Micky it is also about his brother Dicky played by Bale. The over the top, loony, egotistical, wired Dicky plays an amusing, odd-couply contrast to the mild mannered, unassuming solid Micky. He too must make a climatic decision in the movie with regards to his life and his vulnerability with drugs. These two characters play off each other as can be imagined of fighter brothers with such drastically different personalities. Despite the obvious confrontations, their hearts for each other are warmly felt. What makes this a very good movie is that you really care about the characters. Good acting from Amy Adam's loving womanliness, to Bale's charming goofiness, to Walberg's unassuming soft-spoken way create characters that represent a common Americana. The familiarity felt from these people blended with the all American setting of Lowell Mass, with its array of down-home individuals, provide us with characters that are so endearing that we can't help but to effortlessly empathize with them.",9,2,2,22 December 2010
Up in the Air," A Decent Satire
","We are drawn in by interesting, unique storyline and smart satirizations. About a man whose unique job is to fly around the country to inform people that they are fired. He meets a young ambitious woman that joins his company and who wants to change the system. Her ideas clash with his personal lifestyle choices.What the movie really is about is lifestyle choices, and relationship choices, choosing independence and freedom versus commitment and well established interpersonal relationships. By taking a definitive stance the movie provides interesting commentary on those that for whatever reason (not necessarily for work) don't stay put. A Monotone mood is established, that gave a bland aspect as though nothing substantial was happening. Part of the story took a dull meandering at times, however there were unconventional plot twists that made something that was seemingly Hollywood predictable not that way at all. And it was still interesting and entertaining to watch the contemporary witticisms. The two main characters, although not the most true to life characters ever created, were brilliant satires of people we all know. We are all too familiar with the fiercely independent, non-committal, cockily at ease bachelor and we have also come across the, sharp, type A, ivy league know it all yet with an obvious naivety especially shown with her declaration of the specific laundry list of traits that her partner must have. There were also some smart satirical illustrations of contemporary times in business, relationships, how people interact and the recession. For example the use of the smart phones in the new techno/relationship world is not simply put in as a momentum mechanism but is used as a symbol to satirize contemporary society. It is not so much Clooney's acting that is a marvel as the casting, which was perfect. By being so spot on by choosing someone on the cusp of getting a little older yet with plenty of playful, youthful vigor we sense the conflict and the melancholy.",8,93,152,7 December 2009
Atonement," 4 Romantics
","A typical tragic, poignant love story that is augmented by a very well thought out story and technical and cinematic expertise in directing, editing and cinematography.If the audience did not read the book they might feel it is about a doomed love and how the lovers' would attempt to find each other after being forcefully parted, however, the story evolves, into a tale about the guilt and remorse of the one who disrupted the lovers' love and happiness. Her own naivety, immaturity, fear, and disappointment with her own attempts and wishes for passion, lead her to doom the happiness of the lovers and eventually severely regret her own actions.The progressive timeline is not straightforward. Futures occurrences happen before the past, a flipping back and forth, sometimes with a difference of several years other times only several minutes. This gave the movie an interesting texture and made it more artistically enjoyable yet clear since flipping back and showing what lead up to the crucial occurrence clarified the plot.Being a little slow, epic, and overly sentimental it may arouse romantics and annoy pragmatics The ending is heartfelt and sentimental as she does what she can (incorporating into her lifestyle) to atone for her past act of indiscretion",8,1,1,3 January 2008
