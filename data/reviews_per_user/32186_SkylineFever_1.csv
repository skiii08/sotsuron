The Lobster," What An Odd Entertaining Little Film
","Certainly a bit of a dark horse but it kept me interested and intrigued throughout. The ending perhaps wasn't what I expected but I should have guessed that this black little comedy would ensure something different was in store. I really enjoyed the main leads but to be honest, the stand out was Lea Soydoux as the psychotic loner leader. I was also a little dubious given the title but enjoyed the movie and thought it was a solid 7. There were really so many classic lines and I loved the dry manner in which the at times R rated narration was delivered.This movie is not for everyone - it has no Hollywood special effects or stunts and explosions, but what it does have is an oddball, unusual, off the wall, weird and essentially strange love story.",7,1,8,20 December 2015
