The New World," awful, boring and hard to follow
",the scenery and cinematography were outstanding but I am a history buff and hoped to learn some history and instead I am left confused and disgusted. The movie was very difficult to follow and other than the beautiful scenery and the costumes and sets it was not good at all. Hard to tell whether the actors did a good job or not as half the time I did not know what they were supposed to be expressing. I have seen Farrell in two movies and have regretted purchasing both of them. This and Tigerland are two of his pieces of work that I own and they will not get recommended by me for either one. Wife watched it with me and she had as much difficulty as I did following the 'story' and figuring out what was going on. Rent it if you are really bored but do not purchase it.,2,1,7,23 April 2007
