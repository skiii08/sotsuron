The Blair Witch Project," Cult Film
","I passed over all the marketing exposure. I did not get drowned in documentaries or reviews. I had no expectations of any kind, so I saw the movie as we were supposed to see. This film is about fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of darkness, fear of being lost, scared, hungry and hunted. The actors were credible breeding fear and terror, but not always they succeeded in spreading those feelings in way to get the audience infected. The movie has a dark atmosphere, perfect to create a certain mood. Well, I can say I never get bored at all. The end is far from being bad too. What do you guys expected: see the witch on her broom or something, come on. Definitely a cult film for its originality. (8/10).",8,0,1,27 January 2000
