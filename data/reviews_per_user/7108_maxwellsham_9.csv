Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I hated it
",I would love to write an essay on how bad this movie was but I won't waste your time. It just was terrible everything about it. I cold not find one single thing I enjoyed about it at all. It just was terrible. If you haven't seen it then don't unless you enjoy watching robots act like people and people act like robots. I'm never watching another Sci-fi movie again in my life. If you saw it and liked it then you must have a very tiny brain like you're pal Jar Jar.,1,0,1,22 June 2001
The Others," Really cool Movie
","This really surprised me. When I saw ads for it I thought what a load of tripe. Another Horror movie which makes you laugh like crazy. Seen enough of those thanks. This isn't really a horror movie though either its more of a suspense thriller. And it really did keep me in suspense the whole movie through. I do think however the experience would be greatly diminished if not seen on a big screen with great sound. As far as strong points go this had lots really I thought the story was good it really was interesting and held you just in the right place to knock you over at the ending also kept you guessing the whole way through. The Atmosphere was also very good with only simple directing and not many amazing camera shots. The acting surprised me the most because I have not liked Kidman at all up to this point. She just seems so weak and pathetic normally but in this she really holds up very well and plays a very convincing paranoid mother. Finally I think this movie deserves Brownie points just for this, I hate movies where the director and the writers all conspire against you to completely obscure a truth and send you're mind of in a million different wild goose chases to find out whodunnit or whats going on only to turn around at the end and 'surprise' you and contradict all the feeling of the rest of the film just so the director can be right you can be wrong and you can't say oh well I knew that was going to happen. However in this movie there is a big twist in the end and it does sort of bend from the feeling of the rest of the movie but with a subtle twist which is very clever and innovative if not inventive. You'll have to see the movie to see what I mean though. By the way the movie is not fast but I really like slow paced movies. I pay good money to watch films and I don't expect to be whisked out of the theatre ASAP. I gave it a 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,13 November 2001
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Wow!
","Spoilers AheadWell I've watched a few Kubrick Movies and I absoulutely love the artistry in the Cinematography. Its like watching (22x60xhowever many minutes the film runs for) postcards. Every single shot is perfect and nothing short of it. He doesn't play around and experiment with funny camera angles or if he ever did you never see it. It's all original and its all perfect. Thats why I was kind of disappointed this movie was in Black and White. I surpose this is good in a way though. I also wish the sound was better as well. Other then those minor gripes I loved this.Kubrick's comedy is quite as you might expect it. Incredibly dark. You have guys shooting themselves and great action war scenes with member of the same army fighting each other. And then in the end the entire world being anihilated for...wait for it...Body Fluids. Then you also have very light comedy. 'Ok but if you don't have the president on the line in under a minute you're going to have some serious explaining to do to the Coca Cola Company', And of course no fighting in the war room, 'So Dr. Strangelove about the 10 Woman to each man?', and this crazy russian commander drunk as a skunk and having it explained to him in small words that America is about to attack him.The whole nuclear threat thing I've seen in a few movies before this but I wish i'd seen this one first because it is the original although I enjoyed the others. 'the third world war/der weltkrieg', a european movie using clips of the real leaders of the time of the 1980 cold war peak to suggest what a real world war might look like. Then 'Fail Safe' as well which is a virtually carbon copy of this movie cept not funny.I think I'll watch it again this week. Its just a pity that the people who this film most needs to give a wakeup to are the very people who won't enjoy it and won't understand it.",Null,0,0,19 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The worst movie hype ever
","This was a disaster. One of the least entertaining pieces of trash I've ever seen. I wish I could have given it a 0 instead of a glorifying 1 out of 10. There is nothing interesting, original, clever, amazing, beautiful or even nice throughout its nearly 3 hour duration. Thank goodness I did not have to pay for the ticket. Titanic was bad this was worse.",1,6,14,2 January 2002
Cast Away," well worth seeing
","I had read quite a few reviews on IMDb and I have to say they resulted in a great lack of enthusiasm to see this movie. I read stuff like Tom Hanks not talking for half an hour and Hollywood dribble and I had to be dragged off to see it. I really was much better then I expected. It never lags and is full of action, suspense and interesting themes. You don't watch Tom Hanks on the Island for 30mins you see Chuck Noland. It is really a great film and I was surprised it was as good as it was. Don't let other critics jade your idea of this movie cause it really is a very good movie. Go see it now.",9,0,0,8 February 2001
Life Is Beautiful," incredible
",This is really one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It just changed my entire perspective on the second world war. Its so personal that you can't deny it is real. The acting is hardly acting you feel like you are back in 1940. It is so worth watching and is honestly the movie that I have seen that has the least flaws and plot flaws. Really this Puts Hollywood so far behind its not funny. I now love Italian film even more.,10,1,2,8 February 2001
Shrek," Very Entertaining movie
","Highly successful movie. Great mix of animation, characters, story, cast and music. No major weak points and the effort put into this really shows. Never seen such expressiveness in the emotions on animated faces. Hard to believe they aren't real. Some people have commented on low brow jokes in this movie but they really were not that bad at all. Just the odd fart joke. Who cares there are so many clever gags and side swipes of typical Disney type cartoon movies. Should be fun for almost anyone.",9,0,0,29 June 2001
Am√©lie," What a Smile
",How on earth could she smile like she did? It was amazing. I hope to see it again and again. Really worth watching. I'm sure most here have known for a while that Hollywood can't hold a candle to the Brilliance of some of the best international films this just serves as more proof. The things she does are so funny. The Music was great as well. It had so little story as well. It was more a feeling and a adventure then a plot. The big setups you see in American Comedies were absent and it was instead a showering of subtle and clever bits of imagination which keep you wondering what was going to happen next.,9,0,1,1 April 2002
Final Destination," I enjoyed this even though I shouldn't have
",It is not a film its a movie but It could have been much worse. They kept the plot moving really fast and fairly slick also. They sort of keep surprising you almost to much so that by the end you know whats going to happen. Strange little idea and it really is as good as you could get after Scream and I know... etc. Its been killed this teen horror thing and this was a little better done. If you want to enjoy this movie then expect the worst and laugh your ass off at how stupid some of the situations are. I give it a 6 but still worth a watch. Somehow?,6,0,1,5 April 2001
