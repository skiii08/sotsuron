Mission: Impossible III," Great Cast, Good Action, Poor Script/Story
","Went to the pre-screening yesterday. Everyone was on the edge of his seat even before the movie begins. To me, a mission impossible movie should be all about how the IMF team plan and execute an unthinkable heist. The team in this movie was GREAT, JJ Abrams pulled some of his TV star friends in different roles, Keri Russell was a good choice for the role she played. The old returning Ving Rhames is the team coordinator is great as always, two people uniquely shines are Jonathan Rhys Myers and Maggie Q, they had the funny jokes and pulled off their roles perfectly.Philip Seymour Hoffman was great but seemed to be having fun doing that part, I think his dialogue could have been more powerful, his character is unfortunately forgettable because of the poor writing.The action sequences were great, the first one in the Windmill field was some what chaotic, but the one in the freeway and bridge was far better. The Vatican scene may be the best part of the movie because it is the only scene relatable to the original series.I don't want to talk about Tom cruise because I think he had more than his share of publicity lately, his character is still the same but now with a love interest.Overall, it is a nice fun movie to watch, but very very forgettable because there was no exciting thing about the story nor the missions. I still consider the first MI movie to be the best because of the classic moments that De Palma created, like the 'String' hanger scene of Tom in the white room and the Copter scene in the tunnel. This is where you can detect age difference between the experienced Brian De Palma and the very talented but still amateur JJ. De Palma understands that what lasts in the mind of the viewer is not the big explosions or the plane crashes, it is the thrilling chill of a joyride that keeps you hanging (like Tom) throughout the movie.",5,4,10,3 May 2006
War of the Worlds," Action is great......Buttttt!!!
","The Good thing about this movie that the action starts almost right away and doesn't stop all through the movie. However I have question marks on some scenes and some plot lines.THIS SECTION CONTAINS SPOILERS....First the acting, the only decent acting I saw came from Dakota Fanning & Tim Robbins. Miranda Otto was lovely and looked great as always, I'm a fan of hers since Lord of the Ring, but pity she only has two small scenes in this movie. I wasn't convinced by Tom Cruise's crying and caring for his kids after we were convinced at the beginning that he's a selfish bastard that won't hesitate twice about running away to save his own ass and leave his family behind.The scene were Tom separates from his son was sooo cheesy that I almost laughed when I remembered the scene from 'Sophie's Choice' where he had to choose either to leave his son or daughter. The son's patriotic reason to leave was abrupt and stupid, what's he gonna do more than being trodded on by one of the tripods?????? The worst scene in the movie was when Tom blindfolded Dakota and made her sing a song and went to deal with Tim Robbins. Tim was great in his role, but alas the whole scene was better being cut because its too long and not logical. Why Tom was bothered by Tim and not bothered when he was forced to drift away in his car and avoid to hit a civilian and drove to a pillar and lost his vehicle??????? The Aliens million year plan spoiled by lack of immunity, these creatures had tripods since a million year, but they didn't have vaccines against Earth life??? Can't get that either....Go and see it for the action, for Dakota, for the Spielberg touch. I hope he gets the story better in his next Sci Fi flick.",1,1,3,1 July 2005
