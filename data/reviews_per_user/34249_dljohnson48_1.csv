United 93," Experience everyone needs
","The film 'United 93' should be seen by every American in the United states of America. This film is a reminder of what happened on September 11, 2001. This film depicts the bravery and valor of the passengers aboard flight 93. By not seeing this film people will slip back into the bubble of security that they had before 9/11. For many of us 9/11 was a bubble-bursting experience that changed our lives forever. This attack on our nation threatened our security and made us realize that we are not invincible. By forgetting or forgiving the actions of the terrorists on 9/11 we are setting ourselves up for another attack. This film will remind you of how you felt on that day. It will remind you of the pain you felt as you saw those towers fall and the hole in the pentagon. Pain hurts, but we need to remember this pain. For the sake of all the people that died, and for the sake of this country.",10,3,8,30 April 2006
