The King's Speech," Beautiful, Magnificent and Glorious
","I will keep this review short, but this is a tale of much more than a man and his stammer. Its a man struggling to cope with what he is and what he is expected to become. The stammer is the symbol of his life and anyone who watches it can instantly relate to the strength of feeling the film places on those who watch it.I watched it and was moved and inspired, no matter if you are out of work and trying to get a job or are finding troubles in your life, this movie will inspire you and truly move you.You cant help but want to will on Colin Firth. Terrific acting by the whole cast.A must watch",10,1,3,18 February 2011
The Hunger Games," Why you will or will not like the Hunger Games
","I went to watch The Hunger Games with a lot of expectation and excitement and left the cinema with an underwhelming feeling.Let me first clarify I have watched Battle Royale, I have watched the Condemned and the Running man you see the pattern thats being developed.The idea and concept of the Hunger Games is a good one, ( I wont go into detail as you can read that elsewhere). The major problem for me is I have seen Battle Royale and for me that is the same concept, but executed more efficiently. The problem with the Hunger Games is that it takes almost 70- 80mins before the movie kicks in. If you want a quick thrill ride this is not it, I understand its part of a trilogy but the idea seems to be a carbon copy of battle royale with its own spin.I have seen all the Battle Royale films and even the Condemned with Steve Austin is very similar to the Hunger Games. I guess if you have seen those don't bother watching, but if you haven't then the hunger games will be fresh and new for you.But for me it seemed like watching a movie I had already seen before.",6,1,6,1 April 2012
