Antz," Overall Good but I won't buy it
","I thought the movie was quite good.  Unfortunately, I have my own guidelines that makes a movie something I would buy for my video collection.  This one is not one of those movies.  I have a problem with any movie where they decide to stick in the token foul language to get that one spark of interest from that one small market segment.  When Stallone's character used the phrase 'quit yer b*tch*n', that partially ruined the film.  Anything else would have been just as effective.  I just feel that it was inappropriate and is better reserved for movies that might not attract the young adult/kid crowd.",9,0,0,28 October 1998
