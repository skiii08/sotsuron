Deja Vu," Could have been so much better
","SPOILER WARNING: Don't get me wrong, this film was very well made. I was taking note of the techniques used and the effects were not too over the top most of the time.The main problem I had with the film arose towards the very end. The film led up to Denzel Washington's character being unable to change anything in the past - which would have made a much more interesting film... too many movies have been based around people altering the course of destiny.The other problem I had with the film was the practicality of the equipment that the FBI were using. Initially, the film alluded to the equipment using different satellite images and thermo imaging from 4 days in the past to produce a world in which investigators could move around in - that was a very very interesting idea, regardless of how difficult it would be to recreate in today's modern world... I liked this idea much more than the science-fiction turn the film made by claiming to fold the time/space continuum in order to look into the actual past.So in summary, the film wasn't bad, it was just lacking so much more.",7,0,1,30 January 2007
Ghost Rider," Great special effects, little story
","Personally I think the movie only scrapes through with a 6. I think Nicolas Cage is a great actor, and I could certainly see he struggled with this movie - not that he was giving a bad performance, but that the story and scripting pulled him back.The special effects was fantastic, at some points the CGI really blended with the real footage. However, at times the movie became too ambitious and it really made things look corny and fake.The idea behind the story was good, but the story that made it to the screen was too rushed and not thought through enough. Considering 'Ghost Rider' is what I can only imagine as the first of more movies to come, the story should have been primarily about the build-up and the introduction to Ghost rider - who Ghost rider is, more of his background, and not just tell a story which could only be described as a script on speed.I recommend you watch it, but primarily to check out the cool special effects.",6,2,6,15 February 2007
