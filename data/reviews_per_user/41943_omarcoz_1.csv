Blade Runner 2049," 2049: Do androids (still) dream of electric sheep?
","After a 30 years gap, this continuation answers almost all the questions remaining at the end of the first episode (you'd better watch it before or read a good abstract in order to understand...), but it opens even deeper existential interrogations! Compared to 1982, it introduces some newer technologies (drones, holograms, augmented reality) and suggests some present themes (racism {against androids}, gender and clothing issues, human food {from insects}, bees dying, possible loss of digital memories {total blackout}). It uses some audio archives and a short sequence from the original footage, which allows a key character to make an incredible come back! But this VFX integration is rather elegant, at least in the 2D version. In short: Not a remake nor just a tribute, but an interesting follow-up!",9,20,48,4 October 2017
